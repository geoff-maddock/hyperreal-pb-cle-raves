Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} Housemate wanted - Cuyahoga Falls

Nice, safe neighborhood off of 4th St in the Falls. Two roommates are
moving out by the end of the month and I can't afford the place without
help.

This is the pimpest, most low-key, non-cop-attracting place within 15
minutes of downtown Akron. Come scare the neighbors with us! I keep food
and beer in the fridge. Word.

I always figured if he was going to get killed by an animal is was  
going to be some fluke accident like this.  I've worked at sea world  
that had a place you can touch stingrays and I've even gone snuba  
diving (basically scuba diving to like 10-15' and your air tank is  
floating in a little boat on the water) with stingrays.  There's  
thousands of injuries caused by them (mainly when divers accidentally  
step on them or something) but, including irwin, there have only been  
3 deaths in austrailia from a stingray.

Yeah, they were, just like the ones at the exhibit in the cleveland zoo.
 I guess they didn't get rid of the "stinger" per se, but just the
poison part of it, even so they've never had an attack.  Pretty much
unless they feel threatened they're not going to bother you.  When I was
swimming with them I was feeding the, so def didn't want to bother me  :)

yeah, most of those other injuries are to the feet or legs from divers
accidentally stepping on them.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

of the "noise" music of its heyday) now in its time of need with the 
Samadi Gras benefit in February. Fire relief: with the news of the 
conflagration at our compatriot's Nautical Almanac headquarters in 
Baltimore, we immediately released from the Art Damage radio archives 
the Nautical Almanac/Leslie Keffer broadcast of June '04... $200+ and 
counting has thus been raised towards the restoration of Tarantula Hill. 
It might be said that no good deed goes unpunished, what with the recent 
cancellation of the Art Damage radio show on WAIF? But there is a good 
chance that "the damage" will be returning to the beleaguered station, 
if not by name, then by format. Meanwhile, a variety of experimental 
noise/music shows has been
presented at a host of venues around town, along with a weekly Art 
Damage DJ night Tuesdays at Kaldis. With all of this activity, expenses 
have incurred & funds are low, so it's time for another A.D.inc benefit, 
now to the support of experimental noise/musics in the good old 'Nati. 
Funds raised shall go toward the continued promotion of events featuring 
local, national & international acts, reaching new audiences therewith 
at venues hitherto unutilized... Eden Park Pavillion? Union Terminal? A 
showboat tour down the Ohio River? To the making realizable of these 
possibilities, we thank in advance the many local, regional and national 
acts who will be entertaining with their noise, music, art, science, et 
cetera at this lively event....

Sep 15-17                      Earthdance 2006                  Central Il.

September 15, 16, 17 2006
Central Illinois, U.S.A.

E*A*R*T*H*D*A*N*C*E**2*0*0*6

We?ve come a long way and have found the reason we are who we are, and the
reason we do what we do. We have found many long-lost friends, and have made
so many new ones along the way.  Words can never describe the journey and
the journey will never be forgotten.  In commemoration of Earthdance 2006,
we have created just the right place, the right sounds, the right imagery,
and the right cause.  In beautiful rural Illinois, from Friday September
15th until Sunday September 17th the Trance Psyndicate invites YOU to be a
part of who we are, and to come see us inside.


A E S  D A N A   // LIVE - Lyons, France
Exclusive 3 hour Sunrise Set

Vincent Villuis, composer, deejay and Ultimae co-owner. His current project
::  Aes Dana :: stands as a coherent fusion of deep sounds rooted in the
atmospheric and psychedelic tradition, and a fluid down tempo morning
trance. Evocative sound textures, opening as a travelling over his
analogical dreams.  Short tales made of samples and waves, energised by
tribal beats. After the success of his latest album [ Memory Shell ], Aes
Dana continues to treat natural elements and weave kaleidoscopic sounds with
groovey and spacey backgrounds. He currently works on a musical score for 4
DVDs of NASA space imagery.


Yann - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec



Formerly known as DJ Dew, Yann was introduced to the underground electronic
scene in the early  90?s. These events were an eye opening experience and
filled him with a new musical sense. 1996 was a turning point for Yann, as
he started spinning and organizing parties with E.O.M.F. and subsequently
founded Cosmogony Concept.

At this point, the promoter has evolved into one of the most respected DJs
in Eastern Canada and is an active member of Techsafari Productions (Eclipse
International Festival). Today, Yann has a performance history that boasts
of over 200 major events throughout Canada. Additionally, he has been
resident at the Outer Limits monthly events at the legendary club
Playground, as well as at Yantra events (Interchill Records) and is
currently resident at the celebrated Amazone monthly events at the Society
for Art and Technology. On an international level, he has also been
contracted for events in Canada, the United States and in Morocco (Rythym of
Peace, Music of the Spheres, Full Moon, Club Darlah, Club Theatre O) and is
the North American representative for the German label Headroom Productions.
He is currently working on a compilation, Beta Sense, for the label, which
will be out in 2006.

Yann can read any crowd and each set he?s performed has provided him with
the opportunity to play alongside world-renowned talent such as X-Dream,
Hallucinogen, Astral Projection, Tim Shuldt, Absolum, Infected Mushroom,
Midmiliz, Dino Psaras, Son Kite, Deedrah, Ticon, Talamasca and many others.
His engaging unique sound blends groovy psychedelic trance with original,
percussive, banging beats and an impeccable mixing style.



Mahiane - Ultimae.Com - Lyons, France



Mahiane aka Sunny, co-owner and manager of Ultimae. Deejay and composer, she
participates to Aes Dana and occasionally H.U.V.A. Network. She recently
released [ Oxycanta ], a mix embodying the works of pioneers in the
exploration of a new style of electro-atmospheric ambient.


Gift Culture // LIVE - Dallas, Texas



The Gift Culture project is based on sounds, imagery, and art derived from
DSP technology, analogue synthesis, and computer-based non-linear editing.
As Gift Culture mastermind Michael Hale explains,

In this day and age, it is possible to sculpt light and sound as if they
were clay. Throw a midi-digitizer, sensors, and a video-sampler into the mix
and suddenly, you have the power to create fully immersive audio/visual
multimedia environments.

Gift Culture is the result - his attempts to share his explorations in this
multi-dimensional space; to evoke sonic textures from samplers,
synthesizers, and DSP algorithms that can only come from those things; a
journey to discover their "voices", so to speak, using such techniques as
granular synthesis, spectral resynthesis, FFT/IFFT based spectral morphing
and interpolation, and whatever other exotic algorithms he can coax out of
his myriad machines.


Psymbolic // LIVE - Chicago, Illinois



This catalytic duo (Julee & Troy) create Live Interactive Visual
Environments. Since 1999, they have become large-scale A/V event curators
and they continue to push their means of expression through their video
compositions and the realtime surrounding spectacles. Always providing a
customized thematic projection/performance of synchronous moments of meaning
and inspiration.



Cafrine  // LIVE - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec


Cafrine has been producing and mixing live video since 2001 and has been an
active member of the electronic music scene since 1998.

She first entered the field as a promoter for Felix the Katz, an underground
production company that threw a various number of events, from intimate
chill parties to larger ones, ranging from 100 to 1000 attendants and
focusing on audio-visual interactions. As a student of film and
communications, Cafrine was determined to marry her knowledge in video
production to these events.

Her goal as a VJ was to bring an imaged-based dimension to the music she
loved. She now creates and manipulates visual elements to live settings
using a variety of techniques, working simultaneously with several video
sources. Following her interest for new concepts, she has also worked in
with a variety of artists, such as DJs, musicians, painters, singers,
dancers and circus performers in order to create and even broader
interactive experience.

Cafrine has now performed at over 100 events for up to 10 000 participants
and developed a passion for a mix of colorful, organic, urban and dreamy
images. Now resident VJ for Techsafari?s legendary monthly Amazone nights at
the Society for Art and Technology, she has been working for three years
with the collective and has presented her creations in Montreal and on an
international level.


Alberto - Cosmic Traveler - Milano, Italy

Alberto has unique style, flawless performance skills, he is true
connoisseur of emotional driving tribal music. talented and methodical, he
creates intelligent soundscapes alternating melodic intensity and
compositional depth. Dance floor mayhem is guaranteed! Creative visual
artist and well known organizer, driving force behind Cosmic Traveler.  He
rocked our last full scale party, Cosmic Outset to no end and we are
extremely pleased to bring him back to invoke the madness all over again.


Dan Efex [D.N.X.] - Chicago, Illinois



dan efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out of
even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed shoulder
to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an energetic and
intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who consider him to
be one of the founders of the Midwest?s trance scene, a scene that is still
strong and growing today. He was one of the first to introduce the Midwest
to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions characteristic of some of
his styles of trance. But although Dan is perhaps best known for his trance,
do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as he is skilled! His repertoire of
past events includes sets with progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard
techno, hard core, hard house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it
up and keeps it interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and
know precisely what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind
on his musical excursions.


Professor X - Trance Psyndicate - Yuma, Arizona



The Professor is the leading authority on genetics, mutation, and psyonic
powers with considerable expertise in other life sciences.  He possesses a
strange, twisted fixation for inducing mental illusion.   As an integral
part of the Trance Psyndicate and its origin, we welcome him back to the
Midwest for digitally corrupted full-on madness.  :-)

Scotty Rotten - Trance Psyndicate - Miami, Florida



Did someone say Rotten?  One of the Trance Psyndicate?s long lost mentors
comes back to the Midwest for the first time in nearly 5 years.  Starting in
the Windy City, Scotty has been involved in the EDM culture since the early
nineties.  Working with several production crews in the Midwest, including
one of his own, he has played alongside some of the biggest names in the
United States Trance scene.  Hard. Trance. Redefined.  We?re glad to have
one of our main members BACK IN THE MIDWEST for this rare first-time
performance with his home crew.

said, ?leave only your footprints behind?.

Due to the nature of the venue, we ask that all ins-and-outs be kept to a

Earthdance Concept:

The Mission
Our mission is to promote peace by joining participants worldwide in a
synchronized Prayer for Peace and to support humanitarian causes through the
global language of music and dance.
The Goal
Our goal is to inspire participation from promoters, clubs, artists,
musicians and peace-lovers worldwide to dedicate one day to support
humanitarian efforts and help unite people from all nations in a day of
peaceful celebration and harmony.  This year we are expanding the circle to
include anyone interested in world peace, even if you can't make it to an
official event.
The Objective
Our objective is to create as many Earthdance events around the world as
possible.  From public stadium concerts to private living room gatherings,
there are no conditions on how big or small an event has to be.  The spirit
of Earthdance is participation on whatever level possible.
In the spirit of "Think Global, Act Local," each local promoter must donate
at least 50% of their profits to a local charity related to one of the
following categories:

	?	The Welfare of Children & Urban Youth
	?	Indigenous Peoples
	?	International Relief and Development;
	?	Environmental Sustainability & Protection
	?	Organizations that help Promote Peace

Each promoter also commits to include that charity in their event by giving
them space to display information, and time to speak at the event.

The Trance Psyndicate is in the process of selecting the best possible
charity for this event.  If you have any ideas you would like to share, or
if you represent a charitable organization, please contact us.  We are
committed to the Earthdance concept and will do anything we can to give back
to the community.
Stay tuned to our website, http://www.trancepsyndicate.com for developing
updates.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

squirt guns... and be prepared to GET WET! Hundreds of Pittsburghers are 
expected to participate! Wear a swimsuit and bring a towel and a change 
of clothes, because nobody will be dry by the end! This event is free 
and open to the public!

It's that time of the year again kids! That's right, Gothcoming 2006 is 
just around the corner (Friday, September 22, 2006). Time to dust of 
that tux, dry clean the crinoline and start getting ready for the 
biggest Goth Industrial event of the year!

This year's theme is "Tales from DeCrypt", so you have a lot of 
latitude. It's Gothcoming, so school themes are always in. It's a play 
on words, so you can be Ghetto Goth Fabulous, Undead, or even a Math 
Teacher. Hell, why not do all three?

Once again Outland plays host to our party, and we get to celebrate it's 
first official year at the new location. If you haven't been there yet, 
you really need to check it out!

This is YOUR party so you need to make it the most fun that you can. 
Once again, we have Voltaire performing, and he will once again, be 
crowning this years King and Queen. We'll also be giving away a ton of 
cool prizes, so make sure your mark your calendars.

That's absolutely sickening.  Steve did great things for the wildlife of
Australia.  His death is a major blow to that beautiful ecosystem.  Even
though he was killed by a stingray, he's gotta be rolling around in his
grave over this.

the "people" responsible for this (i use the term people
loosely...they only qualify because of the opposable thumb...) really
just proved how much they missed the point of his entire career...he
taught respect and admiration for all living beings, and this
ridiculous display shows just how brainless and abso-fucking-lutely
DENSE some people are!

Agreed, Still doesn't surprise me in the least bit, though.  I'm sure
these were people who just watched his show for the entertainment aspect
and didn't care about all the work (and i'm sure money, even with a big
tv show he always wore the same weathered outfit and had the beaten up
truck) he's put into wildlife preservation.

...so, how long do you think it will be before animal planet is going to
be searching for a new "steve irwin."  You can only play reruns for so long.

While reminiscing, favorite thing I've seen was when he did the fedex
commercial or something he's showing a "poisonous" snake that bites him
and says something along the lines that the snake bite kit was delayed
because they didn't use fedex, but was... *passes out*

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sep 15-16                        ART DAMAGE                      Cincinnati

Announcing the 2006 Art Damage, Inc. Fund-Fest

It's been a year of good deeds from Art Damage Inc... Hurricane relief: 
we paid tribute, and nearly a grand $$$, to New Orleans (the epicenter 
of the "noise" music of its heyday) now in its time of need with the 
Samadi Gras benefit in February. Fire relief: with the news of the 
conflagration at our compatriot's Nautical Almanac headquarters in 
Baltimore, we immediately released from the Art Damage radio archives 
the Nautical Almanac/Leslie Keffer broadcast of June '04... $200+ and 
counting has thus been raised towards the restoration of Tarantula Hill. 
It might be said that no good deed goes unpunished, what with the recent 
cancellation of the Art Damage radio show on WAIF? But there is a good 
chance that "the damage" will be returning to the beleaguered station, 
if not by name, then by format. Meanwhile, a variety of experimental 
noise/music shows has been
presented at a host of venues around town, along with a weekly Art 
Damage DJ night Tuesdays at Kaldis. With all of this activity, expenses 
have incurred & funds are low, so it's time for another A.D.inc benefit, 
now to the support of experimental noise/musics in the good old 'Nati. 
Funds raised shall go toward the continued promotion of events featuring 
local, national & international acts, reaching new audiences therewith 
at venues hitherto unutilized... Eden Park Pavillion? Union Terminal? A 
showboat tour down the Ohio River? To the making realizable of these 
possibilities, we thank in advance the many local, regional and national 
acts who will be entertaining with their noise, music, art, science, et 
cetera at this lively event....

Sep 15-17                      Earthdance 2006                  Central Il.

September 15, 16, 17 2006
Central Illinois, U.S.A.

E*A*R*T*H*D*A*N*C*E**2*0*0*6

We?ve come a long way and have found the reason we are who we are, and the
reason we do what we do. We have found many long-lost friends, and have made
so many new ones along the way.  Words can never describe the journey and
the journey will never be forgotten.  In commemoration of Earthdance 2006,
we have created just the right place, the right sounds, the right imagery,
and the right cause.  In beautiful rural Illinois, from Friday September
15th until Sunday September 17th the Trance Psyndicate invites YOU to be a
part of who we are, and to come see us inside.


A E S  D A N A   // LIVE - Lyons, France
Exclusive 3 hour Sunrise Set

Vincent Villuis, composer, deejay and Ultimae co-owner. His current project
::  Aes Dana :: stands as a coherent fusion of deep sounds rooted in the
atmospheric and psychedelic tradition, and a fluid down tempo morning
trance. Evocative sound textures, opening as a travelling over his
analogical dreams.  Short tales made of samples and waves, energised by
tribal beats. After the success of his latest album [ Memory Shell ], Aes
Dana continues to treat natural elements and weave kaleidoscopic sounds with
groovey and spacey backgrounds. He currently works on a musical score for 4
DVDs of NASA space imagery.


Yann - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec



Formerly known as DJ Dew, Yann was introduced to the underground electronic
scene in the early  90?s. These events were an eye opening experience and
filled him with a new musical sense. 1996 was a turning point for Yann, as
he started spinning and organizing parties with E.O.M.F. and subsequently
founded Cosmogony Concept.

At this point, the promoter has evolved into one of the most respected DJs
in Eastern Canada and is an active member of Techsafari Productions (Eclipse
International Festival). Today, Yann has a performance history that boasts
of over 200 major events throughout Canada. Additionally, he has been
resident at the Outer Limits monthly events at the legendary club
Playground, as well as at Yantra events (Interchill Records) and is
currently resident at the celebrated Amazone monthly events at the Society
for Art and Technology. On an international level, he has also been
contracted for events in Canada, the United States and in Morocco (Rythym of
Peace, Music of the Spheres, Full Moon, Club Darlah, Club Theatre O) and is
the North American representative for the German label Headroom Productions.
He is currently working on a compilation, Beta Sense, for the label, which
will be out in 2006.

Yann can read any crowd and each set he?s performed has provided him with
the opportunity to play alongside world-renowned talent such as X-Dream,
Hallucinogen, Astral Projection, Tim Shuldt, Absolum, Infected Mushroom,
Midmiliz, Dino Psaras, Son Kite, Deedrah, Ticon, Talamasca and many others.
His engaging unique sound blends groovy psychedelic trance with original,
percussive, banging beats and an impeccable mixing style.



Mahiane - Ultimae.Com - Lyons, France



Mahiane aka Sunny, co-owner and manager of Ultimae. Deejay and composer, she
participates to Aes Dana and occasionally H.U.V.A. Network. She recently
released [ Oxycanta ], a mix embodying the works of pioneers in the
exploration of a new style of electro-atmospheric ambient.


Gift Culture // LIVE - Dallas, Texas



The Gift Culture project is based on sounds, imagery, and art derived from
DSP technology, analogue synthesis, and computer-based non-linear editing.
As Gift Culture mastermind Michael Hale explains,

In this day and age, it is possible to sculpt light and sound as if they
were clay. Throw a midi-digitizer, sensors, and a video-sampler into the mix
and suddenly, you have the power to create fully immersive audio/visual
multimedia environments.

Gift Culture is the result - his attempts to share his explorations in this
multi-dimensional space; to evoke sonic textures from samplers,
synthesizers, and DSP algorithms that can only come from those things; a
journey to discover their "voices", so to speak, using such techniques as
granular synthesis, spectral resynthesis, FFT/IFFT based spectral morphing
and interpolation, and whatever other exotic algorithms he can coax out of
his myriad machines.


Psymbolic // LIVE - Chicago, Illinois



This catalytic duo (Julee & Troy) create Live Interactive Visual
Environments. Since 1999, they have become large-scale A/V event curators
and they continue to push their means of expression through their video
compositions and the realtime surrounding spectacles. Always providing a
customized thematic projection/performance of synchronous moments of meaning
and inspiration.



Cafrine  // LIVE - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec


Cafrine has been producing and mixing live video since 2001 and has been an
active member of the electronic music scene since 1998.

She first entered the field as a promoter for Felix the Katz, an underground
production company that threw a various number of events, from intimate
chill parties to larger ones, ranging from 100 to 1000 attendants and
focusing on audio-visual interactions. As a student of film and
communications, Cafrine was determined to marry her knowledge in video
production to these events.

Her goal as a VJ was to bring an imaged-based dimension to the music she
loved. She now creates and manipulates visual elements to live settings
using a variety of techniques, working simultaneously with several video
sources. Following her interest for new concepts, she has also worked in
with a variety of artists, such as DJs, musicians, painters, singers,
dancers and circus performers in order to create and even broader
interactive experience.

Cafrine has now performed at over 100 events for up to 10 000 participants
and developed a passion for a mix of colorful, organic, urban and dreamy
images. Now resident VJ for Techsafari?s legendary monthly Amazone nights at
the Society for Art and Technology, she has been working for three years
with the collective and has presented her creations in Montreal and on an
international level.


Alberto - Cosmic Traveler - Milano, Italy

Alberto has unique style, flawless performance skills, he is true
connoisseur of emotional driving tribal music. talented and methodical, he
creates intelligent soundscapes alternating melodic intensity and
compositional depth. Dance floor mayhem is guaranteed! Creative visual
artist and well known organizer, driving force behind Cosmic Traveler.  He
rocked our last full scale party, Cosmic Outset to no end and we are
extremely pleased to bring him back to invoke the madness all over again.


Dan Efex [D.N.X.] - Chicago, Illinois



dan efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out of
even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed shoulder
to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an energetic and
intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who consider him to
be one of the founders of the Midwest?s trance scene, a scene that is still
strong and growing today. He was one of the first to introduce the Midwest
to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions characteristic of some of
his styles of trance. But although Dan is perhaps best known for his trance,
do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as he is skilled! His repertoire of
past events includes sets with progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard
techno, hard core, hard house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it
up and keeps it interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and
know precisely what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind
on his musical excursions.


Professor X - Trance Psyndicate - Yuma, Arizona



The Professor is the leading authority on genetics, mutation, and psyonic
powers with considerable expertise in other life sciences.  He possesses a
strange, twisted fixation for inducing mental illusion.   As an integral
part of the Trance Psyndicate and its origin, we welcome him back to the
Midwest for digitally corrupted full-on madness.  :-)

Scotty Rotten - Trance Psyndicate - Miami, Florida



Did someone say Rotten?  One of the Trance Psyndicate?s long lost mentors
comes back to the Midwest for the first time in nearly 5 years.  Starting in
the Windy City, Scotty has been involved in the EDM culture since the early
nineties.  Working with several production crews in the Midwest, including
one of his own, he has played alongside some of the biggest names in the
United States Trance scene.  Hard. Trance. Redefined.  We?re glad to have
one of our main members BACK IN THE MIDWEST for this rare first-time
performance with his home crew.

Earthdance Concept:

The Mission
Our mission is to promote peace by joining participants worldwide in a
synchronized Prayer for Peace and to support humanitarian causes through the
global language of music and dance.
The Goal
Our goal is to inspire participation from promoters, clubs, artists,
musicians and peace-lovers worldwide to dedicate one day to support
humanitarian efforts and help unite people from all nations in a day of
peaceful celebration and harmony.  This year we are expanding the circle to
include anyone interested in world peace, even if you can't make it to an
official event.
The Objective
Our objective is to create as many Earthdance events around the world as
possible.  From public stadium concerts to private living room gatherings,
there are no conditions on how big or small an event has to be.  The spirit
of Earthdance is participation on whatever level possible.
In the spirit of "Think Global, Act Local," each local promoter must donate
at least 50% of their profits to a local charity related to one of the
following categories:

	?	The Welfare of Children & Urban Youth
	?	Indigenous Peoples
	?	International Relief and Development;
	?	Environmental Sustainability & Protection
	?	Organizations that help Promote Peace

Each promoter also commits to include that charity in their event by giving
them space to display information, and time to speak at the event.

The Trance Psyndicate is in the process of selecting the best possible
charity for this event.  If you have any ideas you would like to share, or
if you represent a charitable organization, please contact us.  We are
committed to the Earthdance concept and will do anything we can to give back
to the community.
Stay tuned to our website, http://www.trancepsyndicate.com for developing
updates.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

It's that time of the year again kids! That's right, Gothcoming 2006 is 
just around the corner (Friday, September 22, 2006). Time to dust of 
that tux, dry clean the crinoline and start getting ready for the 
biggest Goth Industrial event of the year!

This year's theme is "Tales from DeCrypt", so you have a lot of 
latitude. It's Gothcoming, so school themes are always in. It's a play 
on words, so you can be Ghetto Goth Fabulous, Undead, or even a Math 
Teacher. Hell, why not do all three?

Once again Outland plays host to our party, and we get to celebrate it's 
first official year at the new location. If you haven't been there yet, 
you really need to check it out!

This is YOUR party so you need to make it the most fun that you can. 
Once again, we have Voltaire performing, and he will once again, be 
crowning this years King and Queen. We'll also be giving away a ton of 
cool prizes, so make sure your mark your calendars.

"Ex" girlfriend is what I meant to say. Hit me back with your hate mail
now, haters.

(And I DON'T mean his nice ex who's on this list - as far as I know she's
a really awesome person.)


There's fucking blood on my hands and shirt and I really wish it wasn't
mine. Have a nice day.

I clicked the nunchaku tag, and man what a suprise. Well, not really,  
but it was kind of... weird... to see so many movies of dudes who  
play with nunchuks in their bedrooms.

Personally, I prefer this guy. Mostly for his Super Greg outfit at  
the end.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

It's just like your dad.
It only comes once a week.
When it does, it's usually really fucking loud and there's a ton of 
booze involved.
And there are typically more men than women present.

You may see: Alaska - aBz - Ben Carter Smith, III - Absolut - Cutups - 
DJ Ra - Depth One - Ratana - Jungle Jake.

Details are as follows: There is a raffle for freshly pressed copy of 
MILKIT-001 on the Steeler Nations very own Milk Records. In case you 
haven't been watching CNN, it's the debut of the Alaska and aBz tunes 
Daydreams and Swerve, respectively. You just show up, pay $2, and your 
chance comes into existence.

Also, some of the residents are going to be handing out mix CD's. If you 
need new drive to and from work/school material for the car, or new 
beats to impress the raver chick / dude you just met on Myspace, come on 
down.

$2 Iron Drafts.

FUZZ! happens every Wednesday around 10ish in the PM at the Bloomfield

industrial, often abrasive style, they have acquired the support from 
the likes of Dylan, Dieselboy, Evol Intent and more. You can be certain 
their tracks and live sets will be turning heads for a long time. Be on 
the lookout for such tracks as Devils Rage (Sinuous), Decapitator (G2), 
Bitch w/GEIN (Freak), Aneurysm (Evol Intent) and Hollowpoint (AT 
Recordings) as well as a multitude of collaborations and new offerings.

their all original sound, Twinhooker & Paulie Walnuts have helped set 
the par for New School Ragga production world wide. These guys have 
performed throughout the US and completed several full scale Euopean

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

It's that time of the year again kids! That's right, Gothcoming 2006 is 
just around the corner (Friday, September 22, 2006). Time to dust of 
that tux, dry clean the crinoline and start getting ready for the 
biggest Goth Industrial event of the year!

This year's theme is "Tales from DeCrypt", so you have a lot of 
latitude. It's Gothcoming, so school themes are always in. It's a play 
on words, so you can be Ghetto Goth Fabulous, Undead, or even a Math 
Teacher. Hell, why not do all three?

Once again Outland plays host to our party, and we get to celebrate it's 
first official year at the new location. If you haven't been there yet, 
you really need to check it out!

This is YOUR party so you need to make it the most fun that you can. 
Once again, we have Voltaire performing, and he will once again, be 
crowning this years King and Queen. We'll also be giving away a ton of 
cool prizes, so make sure your mark your calendars.

This is BSP.

I will be in columbus this weekend for the penn state - ohio state game
tomorrow, and picked up a small gig at Bento in columbus tonight.

music starts at 10, i think i go on at 11-1ish.  I'll be playing some more
uptempo house, broken beat/breaks, and some electro tonight, so i'd like to
see anyone in the area that i know, or even people that i dont know.

Bento is the place formerly known as Insomnia and is approx at 13th and High
on campus.  Not sure of cover (if there even is one) or drink specials, but
if the cover is more than 3 bucks, tell the door man that you're from the
pb-cle list (i'll be sure to take care of that when i get there tonight so
that they know to not rape people out to listen to some good music).

Cheers n hoes,
-Goose

First off, thanks to the goahead crew for great sounds and marisa for
the great deco.  Really surprised of the turnout.  Good news is the next
one has be confirmed.  Only thing that sucked was I guess the bar
charging $5.00 for water?  And beer was $4.00.  I've been there before
and water was maybe $2 or $3? not sure exactly.

Great pics, Todd. :)  Thanks to all who came out on Saturday!! I got to see
some people whom I haven't seen in YEARS!! Thanks to Derek and Tony for the
spectacular visuals!!  Thank you Marisa, Erik and Stas for the awesome deco,
and also thanks to Rachel and CJ for all your help as well!! We had a very
good turnout and everyone was getting down to the psychedelic beats. Good
thing the smoke detectors went off towards the end of the party and not any
sooner. What a crazy and fun night!! Can't wait for the next one on the
14th!!!!!

Yeah that $5.00 for water was totally bogus!!  I really have no idea why
they were charging that much for water :(  We're going to try our best to
get a good drink special for the next one.

Subject: {pb-cle} "debt negotiation" questions

Just hoping to pick some brains to determine which route I should take in
tackling some pesky credit card debt.

I'm trying to research 'credit counseling' versus 'professional debt
negotiation.' One is non-profit and the other is where a laywer haggles
with your creditors, no? Can anyone steer me in the right direction here?
Google is littered with ads and information for both types of services and
it's a little overwhelming. Meanwhile, being late two months in a row has
left me with a $$$SICK minimum payment for one credit card!

Thanks,

Amanda

Negotiating the debt will kinda splat your credit for seven years.

Call up the credit card company, and see if they won't make you a deal
as well, and specifically ask if said deal will harm your credit
rating in any way?

Thanks to all who came out to support our first monthly at the  
View!!  The psychedelic soul train kept everyone dancing throughout  
the entire night, it amazed me that there were so many people left  
dancing when the lights came on.  The visuals by Wallpaper (Dwreck  
and Tony) were fantastic, and really added to the whole ambiance of  
the night.  I could not have been more happy with the turn out and,  
with no major problems to speak of, I consider it a success.  Sure,  
there are some things to improve upon for our next event, but one  
should expect to make each event progressively better than the last.   
If anyone has any concerns or gripes please feel free to let us know,  
as we want to do what we can to keep people coming back.   Also,  
thank you for the compliments on the deco!  We do what we can and it  
is such a pleasure to know that people appreciate what we create.

I am looking forward to the 14th, and hope to see even more people  
getting down to some psychedelic sound!

Namaste

=^.^=  Marisa

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} "debt negotiation" questions


Well they are all mostly "scams" in that they don't help much, and often 
wind up costing you, from some of the investigative reporting I've read 
on the subject... The ones setup as non-profits can be as shady as the 
"professionals"...

The last thing any creditor wants to do is sell your debt to a 
collection agency (for a significant decrease in value), so negotiating 
directly with them for some kind of alternative payment plan will most 
likely be your best bet.  Really, the last thing they want is to write 
you off as a loss, so you should be able to work it out...

Already did that and it wasn't any help. They lowered my interest rate to
10% for a couple months and that was it. My interest rate is only 12%
normally! My credit is already fucked -- I just need to get this debt
*gone*.

It SHOULD be disrespectful.  We are at war with a terrorist group called

Another thing that a lot of people don't realize is you can get your
credit report for free once a year from the three main credit agencies.

http://www.annualcreditreport.com/

They still try to get your for knowing your "credit score" and stuff,
but the basic report, showing what accounts you have open and stuff, are
free.  First time I did that I found two credit cards that I had no idea
I had (and was probably negatively affecting my credit score).

My interest rate is 20%+, mainly because I had them 'write-off' the debt.

Can you open a second card to transfer balance to, which would let you
work it out yourself?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} "debt negotiation" questions

I'll spare the details, but to reinforce that calling them up helps, I
just called my one credit card place tonight and got 1% shaved off my
APR just by calling them and saying another credit card has a cheaper
apr.  It's not much but every bit helps, and just cost me about 10 mins
of my time, most of it on hold.

And I noticed the fool site, http://www.fool.com/ccc/ccc.htm , has some
cool tools (heh, "the fool has cool tools", sorry I get amused easily)
in the lower right of that page.  If you click on the "What will it take
to pay off my balance" it will tell you how much you could save by
paying it off now, and how long at your current spending/repayment rate
it will take to pay it off.  If I don't charge anything on it, I would
get one card paid off in 3 years and the other in 4 years.  Or if my
paycheck got doubled, and use that extra money just to pay off credit
cards, I could get them paid off in about a year and a half :)

Yep. Even responding to someone this stupid makes you a little more
dumb.

See! I just lost 2 IQ points, but only because I responded on the same
thread. You must have lost like 8 by responding directly! ;)

I'm catholic, and I find the notion of dick slapping an alter boy =20
hilarious. Break out the rat poison and KY!

Columbus is a weird place. It's as conservative as cinci and as =20
liberal as san francisco. But mostly, everyone is just fucking =20
stupid.  And by fucking stupid, I mean really really really retarded =20
in a way that I could not understand without having been here for 8+ =20
years now.

I had to listen to some debate on the radio this morning about =20
bringing back street cars to downtown. Why? I don't know for sure, =20
but it sure is a completely dumb idea.

I hate this place. Let me out.

back in 2000 i closed all my credit cards, and called the companies to do so
(i had 4 cards).  with each one, i was able to reduce the interest to 5%
instead of the 18-23% rate that i had been at because i closed the accounts
and told the companies that i was going to pay them off over time.  I
finally paid off the last one this year, but it was nice not having the high
interest rates.  i'm not sure how common this is now, but once i closed the
accounts and was offered 5% on the first card, when i called the others, i
told them that i was willing to pay that amount and no one ever denied me
the request.  you still have to set up some sort of payment schedule, but it
was better than the alternative.

Yeah.  they really don't want to sell your debt to someone else.  When
they do that they have to lose a lot of money.  So you can go to those
debt services but most likely they will wind up ripping you off
somehow.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} "debt negotiation" questions

After you have good credit the whole thing opens up to you.  I always have 1 
card at 0% intrest.  I get a new one every year and only use that.  I only 
carry a balance that could be payed off in 1 month.  I also put all of my 
spending on that one rewards card.  My new one is for amtrak so I can take 
weekend trips to nyc for every 6k I spend.  I put everything on that card. 
I think the key is to make sure you have the best credit you can.  They 
reward you with low interest rates.  On my other cards the interest rate is 
6%.  I didn't do anything crazy and I'm not rich.  I just make sure I pay my 
bills on time everytime.  I think the first step would be to sacrifice 
everything and pay the debt down.

Be very aggressive about it and this will in turn increase your credit 
rating.  I feel like some people give up and just accept that they will be 
in debt.  Then they start to put everything on credit from tv's to couches. 
I would wake up in cold sweats if I owed 10k or more to cc companies.

I've considered doing that, always having a card with that 0% into  
apr, but I thought that was bad for your credit if you keep hopping  
from one credit card to the next every 9 months or so.  When I  
financed my car I had an excellent credit rating, and I definitely  
wasn't debt free at that point.  But I pay over the minimum amount  
every month.  And now I use the automatic bill pay with my bank, so I  
don't even worry about it now, just make sure to "set aside" the  
money in the bank.  I've always had low interest rates, but only  
recently got a rewards card that doesn't tack on $80/yr in fees.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} "debt negotiation" questions

Well I never close the cards so I don't know if I show up like that.  I have 
3 cards at zero balance.  I could charge like 10k on each one if I wanted 
too.  It's crazy what they will let you do.  When I was applying for a home 
loan my credit score was 750 and I only had 1 card with a limit of $2500. 
While they would of given me the loan I didn't feel like making the home 
purchase at that time.  She said one thing I could do to increase my rating 
for home buying is to have more available credit on hand.  Meaning more 
cards with 0 balances and high limits.  So thats what I've done.  I have 
like 40k in available credit on different cards.  Ohh and my credit score 
now, after getting all these cards and not paying any interest on them? 
850.  Infact I have recieved over $400 worth of bonus things in the past 2 
years.  I think I payed in total for the past 2 years $100 in financial 
stuff (credit insurance mostly).  My last 0% interest card got me for $16 in 
interest at the end because I forgot to pay it completly off before the 0% 
ran out.

Wow. That's an intelligent, well-formed question.

As such, it has absolutely no place on pb-cle.

j/k...I need to think about this one. There's so many different ways
this can go..

Chew on this...

Autechre is the Jackson Pollock of techno while Aphex Twin is the Picasso.
 Herbert is the Miles Davis of the sampler and Plastikman is the Miles
Davis of the 303.

I can see this thread turning into an SAT question:

Autechre is to Jackson Pollock as
Aphex Twin is to ___________________

... and everyone gets 400 points just for spelling their name right.

Well, considering true improvisation is impossible with non-live songs,  
the only ones who could capture such a thing would be live pa stuff.

As far as studio musicians though, I'd say Squarepusher would be the "most  
improv sounding"

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

HELLHOUSE III

October 28, 2006
Louisville, KY
at the Mellwood Arts Center
$10.00 ($5.00 with costume)

Welcome to the third installment of HELLHOUSE, where we acknowledge the 
Pagan spirit with dance and celebration. Why dance? The dance can seem 
frivolous when suffering seems omnipresent and disaster looms in all 
directions. We maintain that dance in a time of death is an act of 
revolution. And so on October 28th we lead a Danse Macabre spiraling 
into "a deep place" "where the sun is silent." When we get there we will 
find that Eros, the joyous life impulse and Thanatos, the death instinct 
heaven and hell are not at opposite ends of the spectrum. Instead, they 
too are dancing. So come all! Outcasts and angels. The lost and the 
lustful. Come gluttons and heretics. Come all and laugh into the face of 
death The divine comedy.
Musical Talent
MATTHEW DEAR as AUDION

Ghostly / Spectral / M-nus

Matthew DearDisplaying a capacity for styles ranging from rhythmic pop 
to gritty tech-house, Matthew Dear has quickly become one of America's 
most revered electronic producers. Between stunning live performances, 
evolved DJ sets and highly developed recordings, Matthew has perked the 
ears of the industry's best. His debut album under his birth name, Leave 
Luck to Heaven, is sleek minimal techno, containing an extraordinary 
sense of songcraft and an ambient soul; it was given four stars by 
Rolling Stone, amongst dozens of other rave reviews and spots on 
numerous 'Best of 2003' lists. The mini-LP Backstroke garnered similar 
praise in 2004 and served to galvanize his placement amongst the world's 
finest minimal electronic producers. He has more recently adopted the 
Audion alias, which explores a markedly harder edge of his sound, 
suffused with massive beats and sawtooth synth oscillations. Having 
closed out 2004 as XLR8R magazine's "Artist of the Year" in addition to 
appearances at Mutek, Coachella, and Fabric (London) Dear now turns to 
Audion for Fall 2005's Suckfish LP and further touring around the world. 
Plans for 2006 include a full-length follow-up to Leave Luck to Heaven 
that will further trace the evolution of the distinct Matthew Dear 
sound.
DEREK PLASLAIKO

Ghostly

Derek PlaslaikoThis year Derek becomes a staple of the HELLHOUSE 
aesthetic. A Midwest favorite for years, now living in New York City. 
Derek Plaslaiko delves into the realm of dance music in which the head 
and body are equally active. The records he plays click and whirl inside 
the brain while the low end keeps the body busy. Mixing lush techno with 
jackin house and a healthy dose of Detroit classics, Plaslaiko is known 
for his creative track selection, seamlessly woven by pin-point mixing 
skills that rival international DJs like Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, 
and Laurent Garnier (all of whom Plaslaiko has shared deck time with). A 
lifelong music obsessive, Plaslaiko began DJing in 1995, becoming a 
regular on Detroits weekend rave circuit. He was a virtual resident at 
the citys legendary Syst3m Poorboy and Analog parties, as well as the 
weekly resident at Motor-Detroits Tuesday night throw-down, Family. 
Derek was invited by Carl Craig to play the inaugural Detroit Electronic 
Music Festival in 2000. In addition to events across the Midwest, he has 
played internationally (in Dresden and Koln) and has taken to the decks 
at clubbing institutions such as Smartbar in Chicago and Tronic 
Treatment in New York City. Plaslaiko has played alongside Josh Wink, 
John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, 
Ectomorph, Matthew Herbert, Mike Huckaby, Green Velvet, and Luke Slater. 
Trained in the masterful arts of Motown DJing, Derek Plaslaiko is 
heading up yet another wave of Detroit talent poised to rejuvenate 
dancefloors across the globe.
SKL presents:
JASON CLARK AND ROACH

Son of Dog Mini-Reunion

Jason Clark and RoachJason and Roach started playing music together over 
15 years ago, forming the seminal grindcore band Son Of Dog. Years have 
past, and Roach has gone on to travel the world, eventually settling in 
Los Angeles and performing in various bands and performance acts. Last 
year Roach was the featured theremin player on the Ellen Degeneres Show 
Halloween episode, which obviously foiled plans for the reunion at 
HELLHOUSE II. Since last year, Jason and Roach have performed together 
across the country as AUTOBAHN, the fictitious nihilist band from the 
movie The Big Lebowski. Following the Son of Dog years, Jason teamed up 
with an oddball cast of characters, and formed SKL, a group of 
electronic musicians, performance artists, and other artists. He's also 
released quite a few CD's along the way. This won't be a full reunion of 
Son of Dog, because band practice is difficult from 1200 miles away, but 
expect Halloween to be fully represented by these two characters.
THE RIVETER

(aka LADY FOURSQUARE)

The RiveterWith a fall release due on Felix da Housecat's electro-house 
imprint, Rude Photo one thing certain: This Louisville Slugger is NOT 
hitting like a girl. This summer saw the launch of Backbreaker 
Recordings when she became one of a handful of female label owners 
worldwide. With singles from her Body Language (with KDK) project 
landing on hot pick lists globally, the labels first single, Hijack 
broke the top ten on several international charts. Her set at Hellhouse 
III will feature predominantly original tracks and debuts previously 
unheard material for the first time anywhere.
FRANKIE VEGA

Chicago

Frankie VegaCurrently Frankie Vega heads record labels: Blueline, 
Uppercut, Ammo Recordings, Ghetto Test, and is Assistant director of 
Dust Traxx record label. Daily, he manages Distribution for 35 exclusive 
record labels. Frankie is an infectious force spreading awareness of 
artists, record releases and putting their music on the shelves working 
directly with hundreds of store owners and buyers monthly. When the sun 
goes down, Frankie Vega and partners host signature club and ball room 
events such as IN YOUR SYSTEM, BOTS, BIG BANG SESSIONS and other brands 
through promotion company Majestic Night Life.
MOWGLI

Cincinnati

MowgliIn over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and 
Jungle, Mowgli has held his ground as a forefather of the sound in the 
Mid-West. Along with Troll, they have been the epitome of excellent DJ's 
with proper knowledge and attitude in and around the Mid-West. As of 
recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing drums and sampling loops. He 
has equipped artists such as A-sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheadz), Dylan & 
Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with 
these drum breaks. He is busy being a regular resident at almost every 
club in the Cincinnati area and is now working with Identity, a Native 
Cincinnati Turntablist on a more hip-hop influenced sound while still 
paying homage to Drum & Bass.
The Details

If you have attended HELLHOUSE in the past, you know what to expect. For 
those that haven't, and we expect there will be quite a few, here are 
some general hints to help you survive the evening:

   1. Tonight we dance the dance of Dionysus, the ancient god of wine 
and fertility. Dionysus represents the mystery religions of the world. 
Ecstatic dance, personal delivery from the daily world through spiritual 
intoxication, and initiation into secret rites. We expect you to come 
with an open mind, ready to celebrate the inexpressible wonders of life 
in this universe.
   2. Make no mistake, this is a Halloween costume party. Dress up, play 
the role, go outside yourself. We create this environment and make it 
inexpensive enough for everyone to participate. You are welcome to come 
in the garb of the early 21st century, but we'd much rather have 1000 
super-heros saving the world from the forces of evil.
   3. Being the pagans we are, we needed a virgin to sacrifice for the 
evening to be truely what it needs to be. That virgin will be the 
Mellwood Arts and Entertainment Center, a ten thousand square foot 
warehouse space that's just begging for our type of fun. The venue 
includes a 1400 square foot outdoor balcony as a smoking patio.
   4. Cash bar will be in full effect as late as is legal. The 
intoxication we referred to in item one isn't just spiritual. It is a 
party, after all.
   5. Artists are invited to contribute to the evening by submitting 
large format pieces that symbolize the HellHouse theme. We suggest you 
build or paint something that includes the HellHouse icons: Gene 
Simmons; the colors red, white, and black; and the themes of paganism, 
spiritual ecstacy, and evil. Please email j2@untranslatable.com if you 
would like to contribute.
   6. No Guest List. Period. Nada. The staff even pays. Please don't 
ask.

Alliances

Grotesque Burlesque, Squallis Puppeteers, Art Sanctuary, PRDF, 
BrilliantlyMad, Derby City Rollergirls, Racecar Productions, Backbreaker 
Recordings, Art Sanctuary

We are going out of our way to invite all groups of people to HellHouse 
to participate and make this the largest and best independently run 
Halloween event in the midwest. If you feel like you have something to 
offer, please get in touch!

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

It's that time of the year again kids! That's right, Gothcoming 2006 is 
just around the corner (Friday, September 22, 2006). Time to dust of 
that tux, dry clean the crinoline and start getting ready for the 
biggest Goth Industrial event of the year!

This year's theme is "Tales from DeCrypt", so you have a lot of 
latitude. It's Gothcoming, so school themes are always in. It's a play 
on words, so you can be Ghetto Goth Fabulous, Undead, or even a Math 
Teacher. Hell, why not do all three?

Once again Outland plays host to our party, and we get to celebrate it's 
first official year at the new location. If you haven't been there yet, 
you really need to check it out!

This is YOUR party so you need to make it the most fun that you can. 
Once again, we have Voltaire performing, and he will once again, be 
crowning this years King and Queen. We'll also be giving away a ton of 
cool prizes, so make sure your mark your calendars.

Working harder is not the same as making it wail.  How about 
Hardfloor is the Jimi Hendrix of the 303?  Or maybe the Jason Newsted?

Rossz is an enjoyable listen but I wouldnt put it up on a pedistal.
Although during promo of this album it was claimed that he himself
played and recorded all the instrumentaion and that it was not sampled
is in fact false.  There are very few peices on the album that he
played the instrumentation on.  And if you listen to can tell the
peices that are simple or not played very well are his.  Much of the
instrumentation was sampled from Iannis Xenakis peices which as a
Xenakis fan I noticed right away.  However the arranging of the
instrument samples alonside more amen break abuse (will it ever end)
was done quite well.  My favorite, m=E1sodik galamb is very intense at
moments.  Venetian Snares has his moments but overall up until now he
has pushed out almost identical tracks over and over again.  Simply
rearrangeing previous amen and bass edits and throwing different
samples on top.  I think he is capable of doing much better and
hopefully he will realize that and actually take his time on an album
one of these days to show us that he is really capable of something
original.  His cut paste and rearrange formula is getting tired as is
the entire 'breakcore' sound.

When I think electronic jazz I think of...

Andrew Pekler
Meat Beat Manifesto

But to say they are as dynamically expressive as Jazz artists might be
a bit difficult.  IMO electronic music is just starting to come out of
its infancy and its in the next 20 years that we will see it becoming
more and more expressive.

there are to many bullshit *artists* releasing bullshit  tracks
 
sure, i love to pay 3 dollars for some nifty new wizbang track.
your not spinning that shit out are you!?
 
can you say beatport>?
with acid style reason looped out crap
if you wish to be one of those guys....  get-er-done
otherwise, pick up some gear, learn how to use it.
and release some material
on the preferred medium
 
wax.
 
and support your local record shop.
 
you know it just baffles me how this new generation, with all its  WYSIWYG
vst and supper dooper music loopers wants instant hit superstar  status
without actually taking the time to understand the real system.
take it back to the 70's,80's, 90's where people didn't have the  luxury
of computers making the music for them.
 
sounds like yenz got some lezzenz to learn
 
yall figure it out in a few years
 
i hope
 
otherwise this scene will further evolve into a suck hole of 
champagne frat VIP clubs we all love so much
 

So,  paying $3 for a digital track and $2 making it to the artist is
better than  paying $9 for a record and having... $2 make it to  the
artist?

Lol! 

Don't you know, Dean? You're not *doing* it right! Everyone knows
there's only 1 way to make music...

With a guitar.

Another digital vs vinyl thread - joy.  The interesting thing is that =
the people who yell the loudest are the ones have no intention of paying =
for music in ANY format and that needs to be made clear.  Most of them, =
also, are consumers not djs and have no need to be current.  But they =
keep heralding the death of vinyl and calling it antiquated and =
whatnot... and vinyl people mostly say "don't rule us out" and "cdjs =
aren't real djs" which has yet to be determined ;) =20

Anyways... regarding this post... that isn't exactly what I am being =
told regarding digital sites.

I have an offer on the table - and I may take advantage of it - to sell =
.mp3 under the poo-bas name for $3, $1 going to label, $1 going to my =
supplier, $1 going to me.  Plus - the vinyl would have a 30-90 day head =
start on the online files and that is part of the contract made with the =
labels (and we are talking major uk dance labels).  It's like the =
burnlounge model applied to dance music and from what I hear it is some =
bigger labels involved in it.   The most successfully run labels know =
what the marketplace is like and understand that releasing digital =
before or even on the same day as vinyl is akin to shooting one's self =
in the foot.  The rest will, in the long run, find out what it takes to =
get recognized.  Right now I don't see hardly anyone getting recognition =
in either medium....

But here are a few interesting pieces of news...

Today on beaport - the new Kaskade CD is being sold for $18.99 - or you =
can buy the cd for $18.25 tax included at poo-bas.
There is a Defected cd up there for $50.  The CD is $24.99 in stores.  =
There are 2 2x12" with all the tracks that sell at a price significantly =
below beatports price. =20
A piece of us vinyl ranges $6.49 - 7.99; a download ranges $2-3.  Vinyl =
is getting back point where you do get 2-3 good tracks per record so for =
American releases vinyl could be the better bargain.
Of course you can find many other examples, but most boots aren't found =
for download and some of them have them stamped "you won't find this on =
mp3" on them.  But back to the pricing... it is exactly what I expected =
out a dj download site that was founded by people who intentional sold =
poorly pressed disposable vinyl to cookie cutter djs back in the day - =
funny how history repeats in a new medium.  =20

One other cool thing happening....
One of our friends is in the process of setup up a vinyl pressing =
website. You will be able to upload your files, and your artwork, and =
choose the quantity you want pressed. It will be then sent to the UK for =
mastering, and you will have to potential to get copies purchased for =
distribution - and I would imagine you would have the potential to have =
promos sent out to stores they deal with as well.=20

There are physcial benefits to both mediums.  Vinyl sacrifices =
portability, convenience, and you can't loop it (unless you are using =
lock grooves).  Digital safrifices sound quality and visual seperation =
from all the wannabes.  Digital can be beefed up to sound better... but =
IMHO its not the same. When to comes to djing and music... at the end of =
the day, the only thing that really pisses me off is that people who set =
foot in my store twice a year and make comments such as "they saturate =
the market with the same music -- yeah -- we order like 1-2 copies EVER =
of 90% of what we stock - you really know what's up tweaker - and that =
website has their top10 up there for everyone for week up on week not =
doing more damage" and other such bits of nonsense I hear repeated.  =
People who don't poke their head out of the cave to know what's up =
bother me as well... like those who sit behind their computers and type =
away violently about random topics they know nothing about (such as =
vinyl vs digital) and have no clue of what goes on in the world outside =
of the internets and the 5 dancemusic/social events they attend each =
year.  There is music out there that is only available on vinyl -- and =
there is music out there that is only available through yousendit and =
other limited sources -- then there are the walmarts of dancemusic.  =
When it comes to spending money, I would much rather either the artists =
profit from it or business that are part of our local scene -- not ones =
located over 200 miles away.  I've got no problem sending people down =
the street to Bent Crayon for stuff we don't have or don't carry... we =
have stuff they don't carry too.  That's part of the dj experience.  4 =
websites that control the whole of dance music... if you can't see where =
that is headed then get off your soapbox about other stuff.

  So, paying $3 for a digital track and $2 making it to the artist is
  better than paying $9 for a record and having... $2 make it to the
  artist?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} good turntables?

i haven't owned a pair of turntables since the early 90's.

my preferred method of playing is via computer.

BUT anyone who knows me knows that i'll rock a set of 1200's.
(goose? you feel me?)

i've said it before and i'll say it again...

i don't care if you're using two spoons, a washtub and a coffee can.
play a funky ass beat and make me dance, or STFU and STFD.

My equipment got jacked while I was spinning a party in  StL... so I had to 
buy new ttables... got a SWEET deal on ebay, 2 1200s in  flight cases (with 
those colored skins too, tho I don't care) for $425... but  FedEx damaged one of 
the 1200s, the on/off switch is mashed down into the  deck... so I would love 
any advice on where to have the repair done!

It's a tool. That's all it is. It's not an instrument of the demise  
of society. If I had one of those, I'd abuse the hell out of it, but  
not in a way you'd think of... I'd probably record myself playing the  
bass, kazoo, or just put a series of tones on it and use it like some  
sort of sampling tactile theremin with the advantage of time control.  
Then again, I'm off my rocker so take that as it may be.

As someone too autistic to realize what's going on outside his own  
head, and wife is too pregnant to go do anything, I don't see how any  
media is "wrong", but I may be way off base.  It's content  -- plain  
and simple. Dance music is more along the lines of the movie industry  
than the rest of the music industry. The business model of movies is  
a lot more complicated than I have time to explain (it's what I spend  
a good majority of my day working on), but think about it... it'll  
make sense that the majority of the good content will be coming up on  
wax, but you can't discredit a digital download as useless or wrong.  
It has its place, just like in flight movies, second run, and pay per  
view do. People want to get you their content, they just want to make  
sure everyone is getting the best they can out of it.

You could easily come up with a content life cycle that supports a  
lot of different media... extending the life cycle of the content and  
making it more viable for the producers and everyone else in the  
process doing it.

Digital:
Promo
Second run, general availability
Fourth run, digital releases of 3rd run material

Wax:
First run
Third run, remixes

DVD:
5th run, 5.1 Audio

This is a BS model, don't pay attention to it, it was just for  
example. Traditional media outlets didn't have a chance at studying  
changes in their distribution like this, as years of marketing  
studies go into these sort of things. MP3 hit the RIAA while they  
were sleeping, the MPAA only got a break because of file size.

Now everyone is scrambling to get it right, but no one knows the  
formula. I'm guessing someone will get it right by chance and people  
will follow, but only time will tell.

No, but a race car driver should understand how his car works.  
Otherwise, you're just another schmuck in a Taurus.

But what's wrong with a kid wanting to be a superstar? If it was  
meant to be, eventually they'll have to learn theory and whatnot.  
Imagination and dreams are the stuff that make us young.

Thirdly, supper dooper music loopers make me hungry.

I disagree wholeheartedly.

They knew it was coming. Many many many people TOLD them it was coming.

Their misguided belief that they CONTROLLED the means and methods of
content delivery, and their willful ignorance of the technology used
to end-around their delivery systems are what brought this on.

Not to mention their intentional compromising and manipulation of what
music actually makes it to market.

I guess if there's a businees equivalent of karma, it's now being a
bitch to the RIAA and members.

And get ready for the MPAA to get its ass handed to it by Apple when
they release their set top box and the iTunes Movie Store next spring.
Vongo is a joke, and other online motion picture content delivery
systems aren't even blips on the radar. The MPAA missed the boat in
much the same way.

They're already in the process of forcing the obsolescence of the DVD
format with the introduction of HD-DVD and/or Blu-Ray. By
manufacturing the format war (versus allowing it to happen
organically, i.e. the switch from VHS to DVD in the late-90's), the
vast majority of mainstream consumers are going to opt for the
SIMPLEST solution.

And if there's one thing Apple does well, it's making things work
SIMPLY right out of the box.

Only a select few "conniseurs" are going to care enough about the
quality argument to make the switch, and that's not enough of a
populace to make these new formats take off the way the original DVD
did.

No, but there is something to be said for "fundamentals".

You don't learn how to dunk first. You learn how to dribble.

You don't start with the home run derby. You start by learning how to
throw and catch the ball.

I think there is something to the idea that if you learn it 'the hard
way' (i.e. with 2 turntables and a mixer), and you have a sound
foundation of that type of mixing, it can make the other things you
progress to much better.

I learned to mix on the SHITTIEST equipment...Radio Shack mixer, two
old 70's era belt drive tables with no pitch control (let's just say i
had a lot of free time as a teen), sometimes a tape player...but I can
walk into damn near any place, with damn near ANY gear, and still put
on a decent show. Not necessarily the BEST show, but learning the
fundamentals makes working with the good stuff that much easier.

I had the Radio Shack mixer as well  :)

But even still, that was 1995.  It's 2006 now, no one HAS to do that  
anymore.  They CAN, but they don't HAVE to.  Technological fundamentals  
can change and technology changes over time.  I wonder if Kraftwerk was  
bitching when Cubase came out?  Does it matter?  No.  I have a vinyl gig  
in a couple weeks...it should be fun!  It could be a cd gig too, and I'd  
have just as much fun!

SD Memory Card
The SD memory card is a removable, reusable device about the size of a  
postage stamp, and is capable of holding hours of media. Using the SZ-CB8  
SD Audio Recording Kit1, you can store your samples, scratches, breaks 
even whole albumsand play an entire set using just a couple SD memory  
cards.


WHy don't they just put a USB slot on it?

SD Memory Card
The SD memory card is a removable, reusable device about the size of a  
postage stamp, and is capable of holding hours of media. Using the SZ-CB8  
SD Audio Recording Kit1, you can store your samples, scratches, breaks 
even whole albumsand play an entire set using just a couple SD memory  
cards.


WHy don't they just put a USB slot on it?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} good turntables?

That's a damn good question, and I suppose there are a few reasons.

1.) SD has a max transfer speed of 100MB/s, but oddly enough it has =20
lots to do with reason #2. With USB, you're not limited as much by =20
the host controller, but the mass storage controller. Reason #3 =20
explains more of that.
2.) Panasonic is one of three people holding the rights to SD. You =20
can pay them a chunk of change to get 100MB/s speeds, or use the open =20=

stack that does 25MB/s.
3.) USB requires middleware for reading and writing. IO operations go =20=

through various levels of interpretation, so to speak. Since there =20
are three distinct USB storage standards, I'd imagine writing drivers =20=

that work would be expensive overhead, computationally speaking. =20
There is a host controller spec for SD making development easier. USB =20=

mashes all that into the storage device itself.
4.) DRM

In the end, I think a combination of #1 and #3 take the prize.

Wee!

I want the x2 hybrid at http://www.numark.com/  (their crappy site  
won't let you direct link)  It's the best of both worlds.  Played  
with the CDX at one point and it seemed nice, although it wasn't  
"live" so couldn't check the latency and such.  Also once that new  
idj comes out it may be cool, depending on the price.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} good turntables?

Traaaat and I were talking to a guy at guitar center and he mentioned =20=

that the technics digital turntable sucks, compared to the numark =20
CDX.  Comparing them side to side it was a no brainer to me.  the =20
technics seemed cheap, although it's all shiny metal, compared to the =20=

mostly plastic numark.  Maybe because the numark still felt like a =20
turntable, minus the tonearm and a bunch of extra buttons and lcd.  =20
The technics felt like it was a cdj they put a spinning metal disk on =20=

top of.  Although I was at a another music store and they had the =20
technics and some "basic" cdj and comparing those two I liked the =20
technics better, but that was also before I knew about the numark one.

I still want to learn a cdj.  I have a couple cd's of online only =20
songs I've found (that were legitimately free) and wanted to mess =20
with them at some point.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} good turntables?

The MK2's are still the best bang for the Technics buck.  Technics
finally admitted to changing the motor in the MK3, which has less
torque.  The MK5's, I think, are overpriced, but I'm just not that
familiar with them.

If you can find an MK3 that's used, and had a motor die, and had an
MK2 motor put into it, that would be absolute gold.

The numarks I have have sat on a shelf for awhile, but I've never
tried their top-of-the-line gear.


Like I said, real real early in the thread, you intend to do any
turntablism, or just mixing?

Also, how often do you play out on tables that aren't your own?

If you're gonna scratch, try and find/play around with some of the
non-techs.  That's where they're best, as they've kinda souped up the
motors with more torque.  Probably avoid the MK3's, since they have
less torque than the MK2's, but the 'zero' button is kinda nice.

Well....I know this topic has been covered before......but I can't resist.

The right late-night wedding setting is one of the most tight places to drop records.  People are ready to dance.  You can drop anything from Woody McBride to Sly & the Family Stones to Devo to De la Soul and everyone gets into it.  The alcohol is free for all.  The single girls are amped.  

The ultra formal nose-in-the-air wedding deserves a shitty yellow pages
dj who sports the Eric Clapton and Rightoues Brothers BS that grandma loves.
But the last couple wedding I've been to have had multiple dj that throw down.


So....I'll vote that this sig file is from someone who attends crappy weddings.

[mark] rocks anything he plays.  80's, funk, soul, house, disco, cd,
computer, vinyl.  that's why he played my wedding last year... the only
other person that we even considered having play was Ed Um, who if you know
him, probably has the most diverse music collection in pittsburgh.  For most
settings, it's not how you play it, but what you play.  The only time that i
prefer vinyl over cd/digital is when the sound setup is > 10,000 watts and
there is a definitive separation in audible sound quality.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} good turntables?

I've messed with a bunch.

They're all sort-of missing SOMETHING.

The Technics feels..."fake".
The Numark feels chintzy...like you could break it at any second with
a wrong move.

The Pioneers don't have the spinning platter, but are otherwise pretty soli=
d.

The new crop of Denon's have the spinning platter, feel "weighty" and
look decent, but I haven't actually had a chance to test one out. The
older models were not good for scratching IMHO...the latency and
repsonse was not 'realistic' enough for me.

Oddly enough, the Numark CDN-88 dual rack-mount jobby has a great
sound when scratching, but doing it on that tiny jog dial is a bitch,
and there's no "vinyl feel" to it at all.
