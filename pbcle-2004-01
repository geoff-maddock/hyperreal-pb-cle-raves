                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies
(these are moving into the ROM itself)

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Live and Direct


Matthew Dear - Live PA (Detroit)
Ghostly International, Spectral Sound, Plus 8, Perlon
http://www.ghostly.com
Matthew Dear (aka False and Jabberjaw) has made remarkable steps towards 
becoming one of the new great American techno producers. He's earned a 
devoted underground following that is steadily boiling over to the 
mainstream dance community. His minimal-but-funky techno is constantly 
pushing boundaries, while remaining focused on the simple goal of making 
people dance. And take our word for it, your feet will move during this 
extended nye performance.


Reid Speed (Los Angeles)
Breakbeat Science, Direct Drive, Contagious Musiq
http://www.reidspeed.com
Reid Speed has played to adoring crowds in cities all over the U.S. 
alongside every respected drum and bass artist from Aphrodite to Zinc. 
She's currently on tour for her "Life After Dark" CD, a reflection 
dedicated to the dancefloor that illuminates the depth of her selection 
and the full spectrum of her talent behind the decks.


Traxx - DJ/Live PA (Chicago)
International Deejay Gigolos, Soul Foundation Kollective
http://www.gigolo-records.de
Gigolo is THE definitive cult label with a roster full of music icons, 
including the "artist of sound" Traxx. An undisputed underground hero, 
Traxx has seen and lived the evolution of Chicago house music. He uses 
this deep understanding of the history, along with his musical passion and 
dedication, to create highly emotional sessions that are unpredictable, 
diverse, always different, and constantly educating the devotees.


Adam Jay - Live PA (Indianapolis)
Azure, Primate, Primevil, Zync, Chromagnon
http://www.djadamjay.com
Adam Jay has proven himself to be a prominent figure in the world of 
techno through musical output alone. On his numerous releases the styles 
range from expressions of funk and soul within the realm of techno, to the 
more up front and menacing. His DJ sets and live performances are heard 
around the world, winning heads over every time.


Doormouse - Live PA (Miami Beach)
Planet-Mu, Addict, Distort, Zod, Schematic, and on and on and on...
http://www.addictrecords.com
The one and only, returning home to represent the Midwest Hardcorps. The 
IDM flower factory will be left in sunny Florida and the cold hard sounds 
of industrial Milwaukee will return for an apocalyptic 909 pummeling. But 
really, there's no telling what sort of mayhem you can expect with 
Doormouse.


System X - Live PA (Chicago)
Tour de Trance, Input/Output, Cortex Music
The System X duo mixes trance, acid, and breaks into a wicked frenzy of 
sound. Their high energy stage presence and clever use of hardware 
instruments is an exciting live performance to witness. Prepare for the 
journey.


MF (Chicago)
Rotation
The only weekly drum and bass club night currently running in Chicago is 
Rotation Thursdays. MF co-established the night which features some of the 
finest international and national acts. As a resident DJ, he's played next 
to most of them.


Centrific vs. Web of Deception - Live PA (Minneapolis)
Intellephunk, Boss Recordings
http://www.bossrecordings.us
Straight from da great white north, dese two hosers are gonna be bringin' 
da bangin' beats. Last new years dey filled in for Woody McBride at da 
last minute and stole da show. Imagine what dey'll do wit some time to 
prepare.

return of the Chill Room
The government says it's illegal, but we say it's casual!

There's a fine line between genius and insanity and we've got both! 
Brilliant DJs, insane performance artists, and you unite in a throbbing 
orb of light: a room that's one big 3-D projection screen. Chill out in a 
diverse universe of music with small stage intimacy. This nye, chaos has 
never been so casual.


TJ Richter : mind plasma!

Your master of allusion host and multimedia magician; combining spoken 
word stories, music, and projected images into screaming daydreaming wave 
spaces of imagination. Stretch your ears, eyes, and mind wide open!

SUNDAY, JANUARY 18TH 2004 (Martin Luther King Weekend : No School / No 
Work Monday)

GLOBAL ADRENALINE & NORTHSTAR ENTERTAINMENT Present .....

STARDUST 4

On January 19th 2003 we brought together a collective unit of some of 
Electronic Music's Biggest Stars at the multicomplex venue, Oasis 160. 
With over 4,000 people in attendance, we showed what could happen when 
various artists of different genres, different backgrounds, and different 
personalities could bring to such a monumental event. The point of this 
event was to bring a large number of dj's, dancers, and supporters 
together in one common passion for music. This event proved that people, 
despite their differences on the outside, could easily co-exist to have a 
good time in the celebration of "free spirit, great music, and escape the 
not so always thrilling world that is life" As we embark on our FOURTH 
installment of this prestigious event, we too head in a different 
direction. One of more consciousness, and one that promises good times. On 
Sunday, January 18th 2004 come and join us once again at the Oasis 160 
multicomplex venue for what promises to be a night you will NEVER forget. 
Open up your minds, and let's all party together once more for the event 
that is properly titled "STARDUST". Its Back !!! 40 DJs, 4 Rooms, 1 
Experience !!! STARDUST 4 !!!

-- 40+ World Renowned DJs

[my unofficial birthday party!]

Friday, Feb 27 2004
The Third Eye V.3
Cleveland, Oh

The Goahead Productions Third Eye series continues. With this edition
we revisit the dark and lovely aspects of techno and psytrance.


Lori the Hifi Princess – Psytech – Austria

International DJ Hi-Fi Princess, aka Lori Ward, has been establishing
herself in the underground party scene since 1993.

Having taken part in the ever-changing music scene throughout Europe
(England, Belgium, Germany, Macedonia, Slovenia, Austria, Spain, Croatia,
and Finland) Hi- Fi Princess's sound has evolved into a sophisticated mix
of techno and psychedelic music. She has spun with some of the biggest
names in techno/psy trance (Hallucinogen, Orion, Chris Liberator, Mark
E.G., G-force, Chris Liebing, Oscar Mulero, Futureshock, W.J Henze,
Franchesco Farfa, and Renato Cohen). She has also played at some of the
best clubs and festivals in the world.  (Tunnel-MYC, Liquid Club-Madrid,
Koneisto Festival-Finland, The Best-Zagreb, Ambasada Gavioli-Slovenia,
Mazzo-Amsterdam, Sona-Montreal Canada, Turbo-Toronto Canada, 1015
Folsom-San Francisco. Club Kuaille-Tokyo, Japan.Cittadella, Brno-
Czech.Stereodrome, Bratislava-Slovakia.Fever-Vienna.Nuke Festival-
Zwentendorf.Suncity, Graz)

Lori had her first release on Shimmy Recordings out of Bristol, U.K. Her
track, Refused Entry, was released June 12, 2000 on the Collective
Thoughts EP.  This E.P had great reviews in Wax, Out of Hand, Mixer
Magazine, and by some of the top DJs in the business.

http://www.sistersf.com/guestDJs/hifiprincess.php

Sequential Tom - www.futuretechartists.com/tom.html – U.S.A

'Sequential' Tom's involvement with electronic dance music began in the
early '90s when he moved to Amsterdam. His first experience at a 'house
party' pretty much charted the course of events: he started spending every
free minute in the record shops; he sold his electric guitar for a
Juno-106. Staying five years in Amsterdam, Tom relentlessly absorbed the
dance culture and eventually picked up the DJing habit and some production
experience.  In early '97 he packed his vinyl and headed back to New York
City, with an interest in bringing the european underground trance sound
to the States.  He landed a job at NYC's famous Throb records, where he
met members of the notorious Polymorphous crew. They began organizing
parties together, and Tom soon became a regular sight behind the decks on
Friday nights at the legendary club Vinyl, where he enjoyed a residency
with Polymorphous. During his tenure there he played alongside many great
acts from the trance scene. He's delivered on many of NYC's finest
dancefloors, at clubs like Vinyl, Speeed, Cream, Anseo, etc., and at
numerous parties. No stranger to airports, he's also played all over the
U.S. and Canada, in western and eastern Europe, and in Japan and Asia.  
Although Tom raised eyebrows and caught ears as an innovative, technical,
and cheeky DJ on the U.S. trance scene, his taste in DJing has since gone
in a more techno-oriented direction. His eclectic background still comes
through in his sets, but it is undeniably techno at the essence of every
moment.  Multifaceted, the man also works as a graphic artist and web
hack.  Accordingly his interest in the visual arts is developed, and is
seen to hold relation to all his musical endeavors.

....CHILD OF GAIA.... 

Your soul is lush and exploding with life.  Children of Gaia are driven to
sustain themselves and those around them with love.  Equipped with a
methodical and humanitarian heart you can accomplish any task and glean
the best results from it.

Being so attached to “your view” of nature and order can cause you to
create your own reality.  As a member of the cosmic race who makes worlds
real, it is good to believe in a greater plan beyond your own.  Stay aware
of your weakness.

Going with your heart is the key in this existence. You will always be
doing the right thing if you are being natural. Remember, you have
everything you will ever need at all times.  You are a physical expression
of the divine.

THE LINEUP (still working on this, please be patient):


-Mickey Finn - london, UK - Jungle - Urban Takeover

Mickey started DJing in the late eighties and became well known with the 
advent of the Acid House movement in South London. He was given the name 
Mickey Finn because of his build by mates and friends in the scene. In the 
early nineties breakbeat and loose jungle techno was filling his record 
boxes as he travelled the length and breadth oh the UK. Such was the 
demand for his skills at this time by huge events all around the country 
he was even strarting to catch private planes between gigs. Mickey's 
production talents started off with Biting Back - She's Breaking Up then 
partnered Gavin and Claudio for Urban Shakedown - Some Justice. Now in the 
late nineties Mickey travels the world and throws down his vibe in 
countries like Japan, USA, Australia, Holland, Ibiza, Germany, Finland, 
Israel and France to name just a few.
Being at the helm of the UK drum and bass phenomenon means his record bags 
are full of the most upfront dubplates and latest releases from producers 
all around the world.

-Dioptrics w/ Ariel - DnB - DC area - www.focalpoint.to

It was 1997 when Ariel was exposed to Jungle/Drum n' Bass and the 
Minneapolis rave scene. 3D, Snuggles, Danny tha Wildchild, Slack, and 
Casper just name a few, were DJs out of the Chicago scene that influenced 
Ariel into DJing himself. He was officially hooked on the musical style 
known as Jungle/Drum n' Bass.
His sets vary from Progressive, to Ragga, to Hard, to Experimental and 
everything in between, always with some exclusive material of his own and 
always trying to keep his listeners on their toes. Recently he has been 
premiering numerous tracks of his on dub plates and will very soon play 
only on dub plates.
Though exposed to varied degrees of academic electronic music in school, 
Ariel's passion for Drum and Bass has landed him a permanent home in his 
studio where he spends a majority of his time. His style of production 
displays many influences such as UFO!, Aphex Twin, Goldie, Facs, and Klute 
just to name a few. Although writing within the structure of the DnB 
style, Ariel's concept of sound, color, timbre, and form are greatly 
derived from art/academic music. In writing Drum and Bass he is trying to 
achieve an equal blend of urban and artistic sounds, while keeping the 
listener in suspense and of course MOVING!!!


-Soniq Stylz - hard house/breaks - dayton - www.focalpoint.to

For the past eight years, Tim Hayes aka DJ Soniq Stylz has been honing his 
skills in the mid-west club scene, searching for the right combination of 
genres. Finding it in nu-skool breaks and hard house, Soniq is one to look 
for in the future. With several club residencies and main events under his

-React - techno - cincy/chicago - www.subsonik.com / www.focalpoint.to

React is the driving force behind Subsonik Productions, a crew that has 
brought world class talent and high quality events to Ohio since 1998. 
Also one of the regions leading techno DJ's, his style varies from thought 
provoking minimal techno, to sophisticated tech-house, to floor driving 
techno. React's mixing style and technique is just as eclectic as his 
sound, and ranges from smooth and progressive in nature to a more Detroit 
influenced style of turntablism (tricks, cutting, backspins, etc). React 
has rocked a large number of clubs and parties, with numerous appearances 
in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Columbus, Dayton, his home town of 
Cincinnati, and others. React is currently focusing on 3 turntable mastery 
and 2 x 4 sets with other techno DJ's, in addition to building a studio to 
produce music.


-Mowgli - DnB - cincy - www.focalpoint.to

In over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and Jungle, 
Mowgli has held his ground as a forefather of the sound in the Mid-West. 
Along with Troll, they have been the epitome of excellent DJ's with proper 
knowledge and attitude. As of recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing 
drums and sampling loops. He has equipped artists such as 
A-Sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheads), Dylan & Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), 
MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with these drum breaks. Be sure to 
check out his event CHILLED, every Tuesday at the Bamboo Club in Newport,

-Infinite Grey - cincy - house (live Pa) – www.focalpoint.to, 
www.linenoiz.com

John's technique to live performance is different from many live PA's. It 
includes live recording and manipulation of sequences and does not involve 
a computer or master sequencer. Instead, he uses separate sequencers to 
control each instrument (sampler, synthesizer, drum machine) 
independently, which allows for a degree of live improvisation. Because he 
produces and remixes material live, every performance is a unique 
experience. Over the past 3 years John has played at some of the largest 
parties and clubs around Ohio.


-Kenya DuBois - portland, OR - downtempo/trip-hop – www.focalpoint.to,

existence. As a Producer and Sound Designer, Kenya nurtures the
elements of ambience and atmosphere in his compositions with a diverse
catalogue of tones, frequencies and exploited daydreamed sounds. A mood
provoking and unique mixture of ambient textures and minimal beats
compliments his cerebral style of composing. Often inspired by the
overture of silence, Kenya expresses musically his vision of artistic
storytelling. Founder of Adore Recordings and Distorted Grooves and half
of the epiphanic collaborative, Popularity Contest Committee, Kenya
DuBois is an Ambassador of the atmospheric state of mind.

Joshua Perry aka Oompa Loompa, has been a recognized force in the Midwest 
for nearly 3 years now. The Epic/Anthem/Hard Trance style Oompa Loompa 
brings to the tables have provided the masses of the mid-west with lasting 
memories of an epic journey worthy of Willy Wonka himself.

release "Gobstoppers" which will include his original track I'm your dj

Starting his dj career in 1996 with hiphop and IDM shows on WKCO 91.9fm,
Catnap held residencies from New York City to London UK in the late 90's,
and has made his mark on Ohio's rave and club scenes since moving to
Columbus in 2000. He is known for a style that is very eclectic but always
a mix of gritty breakbeats, retro sounds, and jazzy textures. His newest
DJ mix, "Rendez-Vous", mixes instrumental hiphop with jazz, lounge, and
world music in the same vein as Mark Farina's "Mushroom Jazz" series.
Original tracks by Catnap will also be featured on GrooveReactor Records'
upcoming compilation, to be released in January.


-Phrenzy - DnB -rokitlabs.com - djphrenzy.com / www.GrooveReactor.com

Steve Gillson exited the womb wearing a set of Sennheisers, but it wasn't 
until late 1996 that he discovered his alter ego, DJ Phrenzy. After 
quickly adapting his musical knowledge to the art of performance, he 
garnered several residencies in Southern Ohio and joined forces with 
Groove Reactor Records. Since then Phrenzy has been lurking in the shadows 
of the midwest, making rare public appearances alongside the likes of 
Dieselboy to Darude. Phrenzy steps to the decks with a unique blend of 
harmonic euphony and technical precision that always moves the crowd. 
Don't miss this opportunity to witness a musical purist in action.


- Robotnik - jungle/ragga - Steel Arm Records - Kokomo, IN

An old Jungle soldier in the Ragga trenches since late 94, Robotnik was 
brought up on a steady diet of beats from such old skoolers as UFO!, 3D, 
and R.A.W. this newly revitalized Ragga Mercenary turned DJ will step to 
the decks for his premier after giving up his dues and working it to the 
fullest to fuse the new rising Ragga sound with the old dark hard Jungle 
of yesteryear gone by. This soldier will kill heads and murder a 
soundsystem all while smoking a spliff he probably found in one of his 
nappy dreads. Ragga Not Dead!


-ADubzz - turntableism - cincy - www.basisproductions.com

subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

the whole point is that same dynamic manipulated by
gradeschool techers as well as gansters and dictators
throughout time: if punishing the perpetrator doesnt
work, punish those close to him/her, and they will do
your work for you, for free. in the end it merely
allows the actions of one person to hurt many more
ppl.


draconian, yes, but let's not forget that our
government has become a fascist regime of late.

That show at the Agora was promoted really well in Akron, all over the Quonset Huts & The Exchanges... saw em in some of the clubs I've been at in the past few weeks as well. Also in the Scene & Free Times... that must've been a great show, Lovethang sounds and all... reviews, anyone?

I was saying the same thing about that show at the agora.  I had heard about 
it from some friends but didn't see one flyer.  Hopefully they were shooting 
for low profile, if not then that  was one of the worst promoting jobs I've 
seen.

these plates do currently exist. i've only seen a few, i am not sure 
what you need to do to "earn" one, but they are for DUI people and i 
guess the police can pull you over just if they see one and administer a 
breathalyzer test.
as for everyone getting a DUI in ohio getting one, yeah, i want to see 
more than just a random email.

i agree about the family oriented thing, but you would expect the agora 
to want a draw?  anyhow, i have been to some of their parties in akron, 
always fun.  they  are doing something i think on mondays at the lime 
spider.  open dex?  zachariah was telling me about it.  anyone have more 
info?  i love the lime spider as a bar.  any bar with straubs is tits in 
my opinion, and the decor is awesome!
yeah, i heard about hesohi at BBs, i forget the date, but yeah, he did 
play.   bb's changed its name to something else, i dunno what thats about.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} How was you NYE in Thleveland; where's everyone been?

I knew about the Akron party for a couple weeks. Although I had friends who 
played at it and I was the one who let them know there were flyers out and 
about. There were flyers at Poo-Bas, (see there are reasons to go to the 
record store other then to buy records; i.e. --> to keep informed, to 
promote your own events, or maybe to pick-up a CD or t-shirt or video, or 
even just to say hi to the kittie.) In other words the record store is not 
just for DJs, it is the social/informational hub for the scene.
Aside from that the headrush crew was very eager for this party and was 
telling many of it!
but in the end yes, there were many who just didn't know of the party! :-(
I did hear from my friends who played that the turn out was slim and the 
sound was loud but very muddy(same prob as at peabody's tryin to mix bands 
w/ djs live sound and recorded sound do not have the same house settings 
!!!!!!)

The rest of cleveland was very happenin:
Started off at KARMA -not a bad turn-out at first-went back later that nite 
though and it was very busy !!! KARMA is  realy an awesome club for those 
that haven't been yet , YOU REALLY NEED TO GO AND CHECK IT OUT!!! especially 
thursdays or sundays once they get started !!!

Mercury was real busy, too busy to stay at though

The Spy bar was nice and packed - Doug had the dance floor movin !!!!!

Wish- was very busy too-although it was annoying to have to expose my 
eardrums to the garbage they were playing in between Rob & Xaviers floor and 
Metz's floor
Rob & Xavier had the crowd movin and MetZ had ppl groovin in his lil dungeon 
lounge , that smelled like church

Touch- was supposed to have a private party, but that changed at the last 
minute, and they had a real nice turn out for a last minute throw 
together-Dj Whatever kept the crowd happy and groovin !
Don't forget tomorrow-ELECTROCITY-w/ djs Rob Sherwood & Dan Mcleod spinning 
electro/tech-pop
admission is only $5
and on Sat. NO ROOM FOR SQUARES- w/ cleveland's orginal collector & selector 
MAZI--$5

Celebrate-didn't make it but did not hear good things

The Abbasso-the only place I actually WANTed to go- but couldn't-no love for 
the non-drinkers-although I'm sure it was an absolute blast- as it will be 
tomorrow for friday nite breaks--FREE
SO BE THERE !

Heard there were a few house parties goin on, but didn't know of them 
directly so couldn't make it
but it would have been nice to see the goahead crew and wish them all a 
happy new years!

poor alex had to work-ahwell that is being in the biz bro !


All in all i think it was a great NY for most seemed to be pretty safe, saw 
NO DUI check points set-up whoo-hooo !!!

To everyone out there MAY 2004 BRING GREAT MUSIC, GREAT VIBES, AND GREAT 
PEOPLE TOGETHER, and I hope you all are going to be a part of it !!

Reese

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} How was you NYE in Thleveland; where's everyone been?

>...I mean, if I don't know about a
party going down...you suck.<
Do you read the ROM or "This Week" event listing on the site? I found the
party info there.
Not flaming you in particular, just making an observation in general of
which this incident seems to be part of a trend: Everyone wants to be all
underground, non-mainstream and so forth, but unless something is aired on
MTV and NBC during commercial breaks 15 times a day and the DJ who's playing
is platinum in mix cd sales or the event's promoters or DJs have a circle of
50 friends they can call up to make the place look packed, people don't seem
to take the time to research what's going on and what's good and attend
accordingly, and event attendance seems to suffer unless it meets one of the
above criteria...

>> Aside from that the headrush crew was very eager for this party and was
 telling many of it!<<
We went with Chris Eberhart and Jess. Very very very glad we did.

Hesohi's performance was tight. Occasional vocals soulful enough to make you
say, "Yeah!" but deep enough to keep it far away from disco. Basslines and
kickdrums dropped in and out at the right points to keep energy building
without building the tempo, which was consistent through the duration of the
show. To his credit, I thought the music stayed vibey and not predictable.
When some DJs play with EQs/low-end voices, it starts to sound like a
one-trick pony. This stayed my interest.

We arrived at around 11:40 after dinner and Hesohi was performing. Live PA.
Even with just a few handfuls of people there, the vibe was already on.
Everyone seemed to be feeling carefree and just letting go into a dance
right where they were standing. At midnight, I turned to a guy next to me to
wish him a Happy New Year. We made some small talk, and feeling bad for
Hesohi that perhaps he was bummed there weren't more people in front of him,
I said something to the effect, "Where is everyone tonight?" And he looked
at me squarely if not sternly, and said, "THEY'RE HERE" and walked away.

I got another drink and around 12:30 Hesohi was really kicking it in and
when I came back from the bar, I looked around and it was wonderful. Every
single person was dancing in their own space. Not looking at each other, not
gawking at the DJ booth watching him tweak knobs, not gossipping on the
sides.

There was a train running through the place and everyone was riding it. The
vibe was so thick it formed a sort of enclosure around the whole room and I
felt everyone else through the music. It was as though the individual
thoughts were coming together to form this incredible collective work of
art; dj and dancer and music making one. My new friend was right, "They WERE
here." The people that were supposed to be there were there.

When the Lovethang squad got on, it was intense and dope with so many layers
of sounds. At times it was a little distracting when some records would
start to slip. It's a phat idea; my only suggestion would be to keep the djs
behind Hesohi limited to two if it can't be guaranteed that precision would
be 100% accurate. But it's really dope to see Hesohi in the middle with his
gear doing a live thing flanked by three or four djs on both sides heads all
bopping.

I felt it was a true house party. Thanks to everyone who was involved in it;
it was a sweet end to 2003 and bright beginning to 2004.

That's still no excuse for poor promotion, unless the
event organizers wanted to draw only the 25 people in
Cleveland who are (1) more underground than thou and
(2) capable of doing a little research to find the
more-underground-than-thou events with the best
talent.  Had headrush done this show I'm sure it would
have been promoted far more effectively than it was.  

As far as Abbasso goes, it was a decent night, all
things considered.  The ametures were basically all
gone by around two-thirty or so (no more booze...go
figure), and the remaining 20-odd folk were left with
the place to ourselves for the rest of the night, save
a visit from Roxy's crew.  I think I played records
until 5:30 or six in the morning...I really don't
remember how long it was.  I enjoyed doing the
'cooldown' set...going from banging prog/tech to very
minimal techno with some breaks, etc. thrown in for
Roxy's friends along the way (thanks for stopping by).
 I think next year we're going to have to make it
clear that come afterhours abbasso will be open as per
usual...that wasn't communicated clearly this time
around (or the last time either iirc).

So now we're into January...Plate Tectonics starts in
two weeks...I can't wait:)  Check the flyer with the
links below...

mine sucked, was too tired to go out so just slept till like 11:30

day today my mom has been yelling at me to clean my room or she's 
going throw all my stuff in boxes and throw it in the basement, which 
she decides to tell me at around 4:00, like I'm supposed to get my 
room in clean in like 6 or 7 hours not including getting something to 
eat and checking email and stuff.  She's threated to do it in the 
past but I think she's really going to this time, I work from 11:30

I beleive it's either SC or GA that has "Casual Drug User" or something of
the like on plates. I just caught it when I was like 12 or so, so I'm not
sure what that's all about, but it's something that's stuck in my mind for
years.

Methinks more people need to be turned on to thing like Hesohi.=20

weekend.

For those who don't know... Hesohi is one of the top producers to come =

Someone needs to put together a night with Hesohi, Hanna, and Dabyre... =
and find that house vocalist that lives in cleveland (the one who sings =
on the defected records).

Amy... I feel ya on that vibe.   A real house party is just as you =
described.... even those who are standing around the dj are dancing :) =20

I also think it sucked that there were two (for lack of better word) =

  Do you read the ROM or "This Week" event listing on the site? I found =
the
  party info there.
  Not flaming you in particular, just making an observation in general =
of
  which this incident seems to be part of a trend: Everyone wants to be =
all
  underground, non-mainstream and so forth, but unless something is =
aired on
  MTV and NBC during commercial breaks 15 times a day and the DJ who's =

don't seem
  to take the time to research what's going on and what's good and =
attend
  accordingly, and event attendance seems to suffer unless it meets one =
of the
  above criteria...

  >> Aside from that the headrush crew was very eager for this party and =
was
   telling many of it!<<
  We went with Chris Eberhart and Jess. Very very very glad we did.

  Hesohi's performance was tight. Occasional vocals soulful enough to =
make you
  say, "Yeah!" but deep enough to keep it far away from disco. Basslines =
and
  kickdrums dropped in and out at the right points to keep energy =
building
  without building the tempo, which was consistent through the duration =
of the
  show. To his credit, I thought the music stayed vibey and not =
predictable.
  When some DJs play with EQs/low-end voices, it starts to sound like a
  one-trick pony. This stayed my interest.

  We arrived at around 11:40 after dinner and Hesohi was performing. =
Live PA.
  Even with just a few handfuls of people there, the vibe was already =
on.
  Everyone seemed to be feeling carefree and just letting go into a =
dance
  right where they were standing. At midnight, I turned to a guy next to =
me to
  wish him a Happy New Year. We made some small talk, and feeling bad =
for
  Hesohi that perhaps he was bummed there weren't more people in front =
of him,
  I said something to the effect, "Where is everyone tonight?" And he =
looked
  at me squarely if not sternly, and said, "THEY'RE HERE" and walked =
away.

  I got another drink and around 12:30 Hesohi was really kicking it in =
and
  when I came back from the bar, I looked around and it was wonderful. =
Every
  single person was dancing in their own space. Not looking at each =
other, not
  gawking at the DJ booth watching him tweak knobs, not gossipping on =
the
  sides.

  There was a train running through the place and everyone was riding =
it. The
  vibe was so thick it formed a sort of enclosure around the whole room =
and I
  felt everyone else through the music. It was as though the individual
  thoughts were coming together to form this incredible collective work =
of
  art; dj and dancer and music making one. My new friend was right, =
"They WERE
  here." The people that were supposed to be there were there.

  When the Lovethang squad got on, it was intense and dope with so many =
layers
  of sounds. At times it was a little distracting when some records =
would
  start to slip. It's a phat idea; my only suggestion would be to keep =
the djs
  behind Hesohi limited to two if it can't be guaranteed that precision =
would
  be 100% accurate. But it's really dope to see Hesohi in the middle =
with his
  gear doing a live thing flanked by three or four djs on both sides =
heads all
  bopping.

  I felt it was a true house party. Thanks to everyone who was involved =
in it;
  it was a sweet end to 2003 and bright beginning to 2004.

Hesohi *is* awesome. I remember the first time I saw him -- at a party
called "Soul Pollination" at the boathouse next to U4IA back in '98. His
set is still one of my favorite rave memories.

open decks every monday at the lime spider.  10-2, no cover and I'm not sure 
about ages but I think its 18+.  I've been there the past couple weeks and 
have had a good time.  Definately the best thing I've had to do on a monday 
in a while.

Subject: {pb-cle} New Year's Eve event reviews for Bassline Magazine

If anyone would like to submit a review of the event
you went to last night for New Year's Eve for our Web
site and have some photos, please email
contactbassline@hotmail.com.

****

amy-
sorry i didn't make it up to see Hesohi ... around
4:00pm i was told the person who was going with me
couldn't go, so i had to find other options. (i did
try callin you though!) i ended up going to Tri-State
Love in Columbus (woulda been greater if there was a
bar! but this was an old school style RAVE! warehouse
styleeeey) but let me just say the music was off the
hook. Especially Trevor Lamont's tag team with Matt
Bandy i believe it was.. DOPE HOUSE MUSIC all night
long!!

Don't know if you wanted to submit a write up like the
one you have below about the Hesohi event but let me
know! Thanks!

stephanie

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} top x lists of 2003

Tom sez:
<<3. Amp Fiddler - Waltz of A Ghetto Fly - Genuine
great soul record. i hope this gets picked up by a US distributor because i think amp could blow it
up on the pop charts here. >>

Somehow i doubt it.
1) There's no mention of bitches, hos, cheddar, whips, bling, $80g SUV's, etc. so the Big 5 won't
know how to market him.
2) He's slightly too old to have the sex appeal for the only other way that the Big 5 could think to
market him (actually, this could be 1a...)
3) He hasn't (allegedly) had sex with an underage girl, so he's out of that race.
4) He's not down with The Roots, Erykah, Angie Stone or anyone currently having much clout in the
charts.

As much as I'd love to see something of that quality blow up in America, I don't see it happening.

<<4. Pavel Kostiuk - & the Musicals - 2000 Black
really off the charts broken beat nuttiness. especially recently, i've been losing my faith in
broken beat type stuff with the proliferation of wack jazzy crapola. this album is more like sun ra
jazziness, in the best possible manner. >>

can you define for me "wack jazzy crapola", please? maybe some examples. i agree that this album is
good, but i'm more interested in what other stuff you're NOT feeling...and why.

<<6. Erykah Badu - Worldwide Underground - Motown>>

I keep forgetting to pick this up.

<<7. Detroit Experiment - Detroit Experiment - Planet E>>

I need to get a real copy of this.

I'd just like to point out that Tom made it through an entire post (and a pretty sizable one, at
that) WITHOUT using the term "the hot shit".

it's a new day, happy new year,
m

I had plans for NYE, so I didn't bother doing the research...but LACK OF
seeing any promotion at any of the past events I have been at in the past
few months aside...you'd think they would spruce up the internet promotion?
I don?t pay attention to Bluelight, but theres plenty of other sites and
boards around. When I looked on the ROM 2 or 3 weeks ago, I don't recall
seeing this party listed, and we all know how much trout loves last minute
party submissions. 

As for scene mag, I almost never see anything more than club nights listed
in there, so forgive me if that isnt my main resource for rave info. Theres
no excuse for poor promoting...and running magazine makes me think they
werent going for the underground approach.

And shoot me if I ever decide to go to a party I see advertised on eMpTyV.

Subject: RE: Re: {pb-cle} How was you NYE in Thleveland; where's everyone been?

I'm just suggesting (from personal experience on both the promoting and event attendee sides) that relying on buzz, advertising, or other promotions to reach you passively doesn't always take someone to the best experiences. I think we all have to take responsibility for some extra effort in seeking out/researching what's out there. 

I'm not defending the promotions of the Hesohi party as being exemplary or stellar. I'm saying that wide promotional presence does not always mean good promoting. Wide promotional presence does not always reflect the quality or interest/uniqueness factor of the talent. In fact, I'm saying I'm not sure the vibe would have been as tight as it was if 300 more drunks were there. 

As an analogy, to watch TV, one might think that McDonald's has the best meals on the planet. Their presence is everywhere; but wouldn't you rather hit the mom and pop ethnic cuisine kitchen down the street? I'm just saying there's a difference between letting people know an event is happening and promoting it.

People need to take initiative and pick up where some promotions leave off. I think as a whole, the 30-second message of advertising in today's world has encouraged us to stop thinking for ourselves.

Correkt.

But McDonalds isnt a one-off party. Laying off on the promotion cause you
think you might get "too many people" would not be a good choice. The vibe
may very well have been tight for the people that attended, but saying you
didn?t want more people at a party as the promoter of it is never gonna be
the case. That?s why people do house parties as opposed to big raves @ the
Agora ballroom.

Some people will go out and do the research. Others need to be handed a
flyer and verbally convinced that your party IS the best on the planet.

You're right: McDonald's isn't a one-off party. One-off parties aren't McDonald's. Therefore should one-off parties use McDonald's marketing tactics?

Cool. I'm going to carry a jug of Kool-Aid with me when I flyer and tell everyone to drink it. hehe hehe Drink the Kool-Aid, man. You'll love it. hehe

Well I think they had planned on using Heaven and Earth  (not so virgin

available. Paul is more veresed in what happened as he went, but he said
main room was some separate hip hop show.

Not sure if it was this one, but I've heard before that someone was being

A common misconception -- virgins got in free at the door.

the whole thing was shitty
they were expecting people to pay $20 at the door
there was nobody there
it was only one floor, not the main room
the back room had dnb
venom did spin, but he wasnt on his game
everyone was kicked out at 2:30

but, i did hear alex rock the hell out of that romanian church

My NYE was great, basically it was the best one I've ever had.  Well started it out by going over to Dave and Amy's from Headrush and they cooked the best meal anyone could ask for(you guys should open up a restaraunt).  Well after about the 3rd or 4th glass of wine we went to Agora and the vibe was perfect.  Well as usual I went to the bar several times so the night gets a little blury after 1:30 but Hesohi did great and then Hesohi and 3 dj's were going at once.  After much stumbling and grooving we ended our night there around 3 or 3:30 then went back to Dave and Amy's and I promptly passed out and then had pancakes.  Thank you both for dinner and breakfast I'll return the favor soon, sorry your kitchen was such a mess.

	: Abbasso : Cleveland

Just stepped in and I am actually sober enough as well as awake enough to
type away a review:

Well I came out by myself to this one, got their at 9ish. Mister Moose was
upstairs waiting on Jay (Rezonate) and his gf Emily. They arrived (in from
pgh) just minutes after me. Went down and played some N64 tetris (got my ass
handed to me) for a lil min and jammed to that Hybrid mix (from Freeland's
kiss fm). 

At 10, candice came on was playing some crazy smoove tracks, def setting a
nice mood as people began showing up. Towards the end she brought it up a
notch and it was getting hectic in there. Matt Coe (aka Mountain dew Code
Red :-p)and his friend took over and i'll be damned if I didn?t wanna steal
their record crates. I was hearing some very nice tunes, and people seemed
to agree by stompin up the dance floor.

At around 12:30ish, Rezonate came on and def rode it hard with the nu skewl
vibe. Again, great track selection, and he even played that sooper
unexpected disco track (jeez im forgetful of what it was), but emily kept
braggin about getting that for him. Sadly I had to skidaddle right as our
host Moose was coming on...sorry bro.

Nice to see so many faces out, and propa shouts going to all the djs for..of
course...propa mixing...as well as shoutz to Paul (aka HeSoSleeps-though the
vid games kept you up this time...lucky), Napoleon, Trout, Bill, Todd,
Chelesea, Steph and Bridgette, Jamie and Val, Alex Holtz (my arch rival),
everyone else (etc et all)..... and o'course...to that 4 legged hooved
animal with antlers that dwells in northern canada and alaska...whats it
called? Mouse? Mooo...Ah I forget...

Ez (if I drink a bottle of Absolut),

Alex

I agree with you completely, which is why I said "headrush was promoting it" 
in my last post
I knew you had nothing to do w/ the prod. and was kinda applauding you for 
promoting something you believed in and believe others should experience,
...which is what i thought was the whole "rave" blah blah blah anyway.

There is a select core of crew that will actually "promote"/encourage an 
event that they don't have a vested interest in
Napoleon (and most associated w/ abbasso, including you guys too :-) are 
prime examples !

...I say "does not have a vested interest in" in error cause they as do many 
others  the vested interest is the furthering of OUR EDM culture/scene.

trying to keep it short..

If EVERYBODY  who cares about the future of OUR culture supported/promoted 
the events and ppl who are doing their best to help the EDM EVOLUTION  in

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} How was you NYE in Thleveland; where's everyone been?


I was pretty shocked about being booted out so early from celebrate but
I actually had more fun hanging with friends at an after party - I even
spun some old dusty records of mine, haven't spun in years.  Yeah, I was
expecting Celebrate something like back in the day when UPS had a NYE
party at the eagles nest, they at least used the upstairs rooms and had
tons of people - and at least had a fucking countdown to NYE.  At least
I saw a few old friends - lots of names on that flier that weren't
there, including my friend Brian.  BTW Nice suit Paul ;)  Would have
liked to have gone to see Brandon, Hesohi, Zachoria, and Mike the agora.
I remember Jet sking with hesohi and friends at house party Brandon had
years ago.  All those akron peeps are really nice cool people, I haven't
talked to them in a long time.  Hesohi is such a talented musician too.
He used to live off of working the mixing boards for shitty bands,
anything to work and do what he loves - Music

Arghhh..

The first two flyers, the names went on the haphazardly except as to how
they fit around the circle.

This time around I pulled it off the tentative timeslot list and put it on
the flyer that way.  The funny thing was when I made the post I conciously
thought "Trout's name is on here last and that's not fair.... so I'll just
put it in alphabetical order" and it ended up that way anyway :-(

damned if you do, damned if you don't.

Subject: {pb-cle} NNR - WERE BACK ON MARS - just landed 1-4-04


Just landed today:
I know this isn't rave related I'm just happy to see new images of mars
and that the NASA lander actually landed safely today - so cool.  I was
hoping to see the British beagle II lander respond from its chirstmas
landing, but they still haven't heard anything from it.  The British
lander either fell in a crater and can't communicate or its disabled or
something.  Anyway, not ours, This is NASA's first of 2 twin rovers that
has landed and is already responding, the next is coming up in like 2
weeks on the other side of the planet.  Check out the flash site, I must
say I'm very impressed by whoever designed it.  Its so cool that there
giving us images same day about as quick as they can.  In 1998 or so
there was some design and trajectory errors that lost 2 missions to
mars, so this is kind of a big deal if this all goes well.  We may
actually find out clues to if there was life on Mars.  Personally I
think it was probably a lot different with surface water and such in the
past and then the core and or electro-magnetosphere cause it to become
more stagnant, who knows whats still underground though.

Images from the spirit lander that just touched down:

HIRES:
http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/54577main_send-p150x_pol.jpg

pretty boring landscape, but they are in what they think is a dry lake
bed from the past so it's a good place to scope out samples

FLASH site:
http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/m2k4/frameset.html

check this out too - this also EXTREEMLY cool

Stardust:
We also just had a probe go through a comets tail and get samples that
will be returned to earth in a couple years or so.  They got some close
up BW images on the comet.  Not at all what I'd thought a comet would
look like close up.

BTW - yes I'm a geek, this shit makes me giddy

didnt they accidentily calculate some distance in meters instead 
of feet? IIRC it was something really really dumb like that.

Yeah, it was really bad that they messed 2 in row previously.  The fist
one that was fucked up was due to JPL designing the delivery vehical
computers to be programed in standard measurement and delivered it to
the NASA people who assumed it was metric, so yep feet instead of
meters.  Lack of comunications or instruction reading or something
idiotic.  The second one was at least a bit smaller of a mistake.  The
lander was designed with retro rockets to slow the descent, kind of like
a moon lander.  Someone told me that what there pretty sure happened was
is a sensor antenna that sticks out the bottom straight down further
than the lander feet was supposed to hit the ground and signals the
retro rockets to stop so it lands softly.  Well suposedly when the
sensor antena thingy was deployed on descent, the recoil of the
deployment caused a false positive off touchdown.  Basically it thought
it hit the ground and shut off the retro rockets and was quite high in
the sky and sort of dropped to its death, lol.  Those were durring
NASA's faster cheaper better ideology, most likely cause was lack of
proper testing to cut budgets and stuff.  Theres no real space race now,
so its hard for them to get lots of funding, so now there more focused
on doing quality work with what they have.  Those new rovers are pretty
cool - bigger than the last one.  They've got cool nasa logo hub caps
and aluminuc rims & wheels ;)

Subject: {pb-cle} music genre "game?"

A couple years ago, Goose posted a link to a "game" where you can hear
samples of different electronic genres. I saved the link but it doesn't go
to the "game" anymore. Has anyone seen this? I've been doing some
searching and I'm not finding it.

Thanks,

Amanda

Subject: {pb-cle} bush in 30 seconds...

i think people may have sent this in before, but things got a whole lot more interesting today...

http://www.bushin30seconds.org

they've released the 15 finalists to be decided on by a panel of celebrity (and quite the cool list,
at that) judges...

i recommend watching all of them, as most of them are really good, especially considering the
low-to-no-budget nature of the contest.

power to the people.

What is going on Mondays? Is Zythos still kickin'? I'm thinking about heading down there w/ some friends but not sure who is spinning and what the cover charge is.  If someone could fill me in I would appreciate it.

We don't care about them, since they aren't planning to do anything we
haven't.  If they say "we're going to colonize Mars with a billion Chinese
people", then maybe we'd give the heads up.

Yea like the demobabies don't have an agenda.... hmmm buy your base and
convince them they need to be supported by the government. That they can't
do for themselves. Set up the world so that everyone has to support those
that don't support themselves. Then convince your base that they need you so
that they can keep getting there entitlements.... Know what scares a liberal
(politician anyways) when there minority bases actually start to do well.
God forbid they actually begin to stand on the own and see that 80% of these
liberal issues are designed to keep everything at the status quo. Bah this
is going to escape the list. I am all about social issues and caring for one
another but you from your comment are suffering from the same propaganda
that you are bitching about. I guess for you being a "raver" is some click
or club that means your vegetarian, socialist, ... Always meant free thinker
to me. 

Think don't just jump all the way right or left. 
Just like the PETA nuts freak me out so do the Catholics or the other side
:)

I don't mean to attack you as per say the idea of what you wrote.

Word. But I won't throw my vote at a third party because of its waste. I
know its sucks but let us be honest. So what do you do? I Lean right :)
seeing as the Republicans at least try and go with majority rather then
constantly catering to there freakish fringe groups.

Agreed, I lean right as well.  I'd be a dead-set Republican if the GOP 
wasn't so tied up with moral baggage, but I can't bring myself to fully 
support any party so closely tied to mythology (christianity in this case).

I vote Libertarian first, and if there isn't a Libertarian on the ballot, 
I vote Republican.


I never understood why ravers tend to be so friggen liberal; it makes NO 
sense in the life of our culture.  At the basic level, we need venues, and 
venues are accomplished by freeing business from regulations and 
restraints (ie: bars/clubs that can stay open all night, lax age 
restraints around alcohol, and so on), which is what Liberals are 
AGAINST.  Also, the Rave scene needs MONEY, and Liberals are against 
anyone actually MAKING any money.  Never made sense to me.

youre another person who would be well advised to learn how

how exactly can i be a socialist if i live in a capitalist
economy? ive always wondered about that. you can call me a marxist
perhaps, because i do believe alot of what the man said but its
difficult to practice a form of economics without anyone else. 

in case you didnt know (it seems you have no clue, not too
suprising since economics isnt a big fun thing for people to study
in their free time) "socialism" isnt a political identity. and you
can thank those socialist democrats for enforcing limits on the
capitalists to stop them from fucking you over like they do in
third world countries where people work for pennies an hour.

Errr, no.  I'm a hardcore capitalist; regulation of capitalism is the 
worst thing ever thought of.

Open Market or die.

If you've actually read about "hardcore capitalism", you would understand
its impossible for any socio-economic system to sustain the constant levels
of growth required for capitalism to be a longterm solution for a nation.  This is based on the fact that there are "x" amount of resources on the planet.  If  "x" resources do not grow, how can we expect to sustain economic growth?  We can't.
We can expect to use up all our resources, fuck over the planet, and our offspring.
This will be after we go to war for resources of course.  



Errr, no. I'm a hardcore capitalist; regulation of capitalism is the 
worst thing ever thought of.

people who say things about open markets fall into one of three
categories: 

1. people who dont know what the fuck theyre talking about. 

2. people who would stand to benefit from unregulated markets (the
people already perilously close to monopolizing media, production,
etc in the US aka the very small percentage of rich people who own
things and can afford to force themselves on smaller businesses to
buy them up if regulations were lifted). 

3. people who imagine themselves as potentially becoming #2. those
are the biggest idiots of them all really. its the american dream
gone horribly retarded.

Just stepped in and I am actually sober enough as well as awake enough =
to
type away a review:

Well I came out by myself to this one, got their at 9ish. Mister Moose =
was
upstairs waiting on Jay (Rezonate) and his gf Emily. They arrived (in =
from
pgh) just minutes after me. Went down and played some N64 tetris (got my =
ass
handed to me) for a lil min and jammed to that Hybrid mix (from =
Freeland's
kiss fm).=20

At 10, candice came on was playing some crazy smoove tracks, def setting =
a
nice mood as people began showing up. Towards the end she brought it up =
a
notch and it was getting hectic in there. Matt Coe (aka Mountain dew =
Code
Red :-p)and his friend took over and i'll be damned if I didn?t wanna =
steal
their record crates. I was hearing some very nice tunes, and people =
seemed
to agree by stompin up the dance floor.

At around 12:30ish, Rezonate came on and def rode it hard with the nu =
skewl
vibe. Again, great track selection, and he even played that sooper
unexpected disco track (jeez im forgetful of what it was), but emily =
kept
braggin about getting that for him. Sadly I had to skidaddle right as =
our
host Moose was coming on...sorry bro.

Nice to see so many faces out, and propa shouts going to all the djs =
for..of
course...propa mixing...as well as shoutz to Paul (aka HeSoSleeps-though =
the
vid games kept you up this time...lucky), Napoleon, Trout, Bill, Todd,
Chelesea, Steph and Bridgette, Jamie and Val, Alex Holtz (my arch =
rival),
everyone else (etc et all)..... and o'course...to that 4 legged hooved
animal with antlers that dwells in northern canada and alaska...whats it
called? Mouse? Mooo...Ah I forget...

By "raver" in quotes I was referring to Entropy's personality and persona
as he comes off online.. it was a bit of a joke and a dig all in one --
and a little immature on my part.

I don't consider myself in a raver "club" .. so excuse you.

To me deregulating everything and letting market forces purely determine
everything will quickly setup a society where power is quickly seized and
"you can't win" and you can't fight the power at all.  Globalization and
consolidation are happening in ways that we have never seen before, it's
quite scary. Which to me goes against what raves were about.

That's exactly what a GOVERNMENT is.  NOt a corporation.  Corporations can 
be changed because they have the weakness that the government doesn't 
have: the bottom line.  You don't like the corporation in charge, don't 
buy their products.  Vote with your wallet.

I am for privatization because I WANT a choice; having the government in 
power of so many "social services" means that we really don't have a 
choice at all.

Privatization = Choice
Choice = Freedom

I always thought raves were about drugs, money, and sex....*shrug*

its espexially funny because if you view speed garage through the
concept of simon reynolds' "hardcore continuum" it makes perfect
sense. dude's lack of comprehension of london's music scenes just
makes him look like a twat. its funny how he doesnt dis jungle
despite its obvious top 40 crossover as recently as bodyrock and
shake ur body.

if youre griping to a bunch of elitists then you arent
gonna get respect for a poppy genre. just like if a
2step producer/dj gripes to someone who likes breaks
about the lack of respect they get. if they get any at
all.

i know im biased but james brown is one bad ass motha
fucka. how could you not like real funky breaks. not
sure what that guy was referring to but if anyone
likes funky breaks on here i suggest you check out the
"fort knox" label. fucking dope! if you cant get into
that shit then you are lost my child... lost.

how exactly is 2-step a "poppy" genre? because x% of records had
an r+b type vocal? what about the other 10x% that didnt? its funny
because the jokers who make breaks couldnt program their way
through mj cole or wookie's nut hairs.

james brown's relation to funky breaks is the exact same
relationship of a rapee to a rapist.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} How was you NYE in Thleveland; where's everyone been?

i was planning on heading down to bombs for his nye shindig in 
pittsburgh...but a punctured tire at the liqour store prevented that...i was 
planning on making some calls and seeing if i could cop a ride to 
lorain...but before i could do that i got a call asking if i wanted to play 
a warehouse downtown...how could i resist that?

so the warehouse was on st. clair just past e. 16th i think....the back room 
was big...2 stories of open space...big ass dancefloor...the front part was 
sectioned off into chill rooms with couches and shit...they were charging 
20bux at the door...which got u in...and got u drinks all nite(any thing u 
wanted...u couldve had nyQuil and redbull if u really wanted it)...me, 
sherm, and duckets were dropping dnb and some hiphop til about 230....then 
digital bill came in and started playing prog or whatever he plays...when he 
came in...we dipped out to our private afterparty(which i can say i dont 
really remember too well)

so all and all, not bad...if anyone is interested in getting that 
space...letme know...its mad cheap to get in there(compared to most of the 
other venues in town charge), and the rate includes an open bar all nite 
long....i guess the only downside to some of youse is its a 21+ venue(no 
flexiblity on that)...altho 21+ isnt really a downside to me.

this is the second time recently that someone has made reference
to some perceived prejudice i have against popular music. i have
no clue where this came from. i wish everyone liked the music im
into, then i wouldnt have to spend so much time hiding from wack
shit all the time. ask anyone who comes into the record shops i
work at, i try to find good stuff thats within the taste of the
people for them to buy.

i was actually reciting your remark of how this dude
who wrote the article was griping about how funky
breaks werent getting respect. therefore i was
implying that funky breaks were poppy. not 2-step...
thats just garbage. but youre still an elitist and
thats what i meant. but, youre not alone.

cool it now or ill run in there, strap a james brown
mask on you and have icey rape your tight little white
ass.

and btw... james brown is funky breaks. i agree that
he has been molested and not many people (especially
the snobs) like that, but, lets remember that the shit
you like is for suckas that dont have a drop of rythim
in there soul and couldnt dance to save yourself from
getting gangbanged by a herd of butch dikes with lazer
guided strap ons bolted to their hips.

That was by far one of the most thought out rips ever (and funny)  
It would have sold me except for 6 things:

rythim =/  rhythm?
there soul =/  their soul?
gangbanged is 2 words (fleetwood's mom corrected me on that one)
dikes =/ dykes?
lazer =/ laser?
strap ons =/ strap-ons?

in addition, i'd like to think that there is a difference between 
rhythm and dancing.  I know i have rhythm, I just can't dance 
anywhere near what looks like a fluid motion (being tall and 
skinny really fucks that up).  apples and oranges.  plus i've seen 
a bunch of people that are 'good dancers' that don't dance with 
any rhythm.  in the end it's all personal perception of what 
should be the expected behavior.

i prefer chickenheading.

James Brown is funk and soul music.  people take the "breaks" from his
songs and rape them, be it in drum n bass, house, techno, "funky breaks"
etc, but I wouldn't call james brown funky breaks.  There is much more to
his music than his drummers, this discussion is really silly.

you can try and make yourself feel better about not
being able to dance anyway youd like. how ever you
want to word it, what ever way you need to justify
it... the fact is you replied to this on your boys
defense because youre inferior to the cats that have
rithem. practice makes perfect but then again people
who sit around spell checking other peoples emails
will prolly never get it.

Have you ever heard me talk shit on breaks?  or any genre for that 
matter (HHC doesnt count, it's a joke genre [footnote 1])?  Have I 
ever said that I dont dance?  Nope.  I said I have rhythm with 
being tall and skinny doesnt leave much room for the appearance of 
grace. It just takes a little more than clever drum patterns to 
get me to dance.  It takes a little soul with a pinch of funk.  

I 'sat around and spell checked' your email because althought it 
was a valid diss, it had too much clatter that took away from the 
point.  I'm sorry if I expect someone to put more than 4 words 
together uninterrupted that are grammatically correct.  That shit 
is like built into every mail client if you can't do it in your 
head.  It's pretty much like netiquette.  

-Goose 
(the last chickenhead part was funny dave) =)

[footnote 1]
Happy Hardcore is honestly just a genre created for the party 
atmosphere only.  Can you honestly say that you would listen to it 
without drugs or without having some flashback to a point in time 
you were on drugs when you heard a HHC song?  It is a great genre 
in that there are actually some good songs that would fucking 
great to listen to if I were rolling face or something.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} music genre "game?"

every once in a while, i take the time to read posts on here, but then 
i realize that the majority of people on here are too self-righteous to 
see that they aren't the greatest thing since sliced bread - so it's 
basically a waste of time.

everybody is different. you want to like house - then like it... you 
want to like breaks, then go right ahead. but just understand that no 
matter what any of you like, it isn't "good" music unless the pb-cle 
elite approve... and the day that happens, we'll all be dead since hell 
will have frozen over, so you may as well not waste your time trying to 
convince them otherwise.

maybe someday the concept of freedom of thought and opinion will reach 
this list... until then, enjoy arguing.

spell check away, loves.

xoxo,

geez tom... i was sitting here laughing to myself when
i wrote all of those posts. lighten up my man. maybe
my attitude was misconstrued due to the fact that you
can only read it. i understand that. i have no hate
but, then again, how would you know... you never cared
about me anyway. in some way i feel like i shouldnt
even be justifying myself cause youre such a dick to
so many people. but what the hell.

well, i gotta get warmed up now... me and mark have to

no, i think its just prog house/breaks that i hate on without any 
exceptions. shit, i can actually think of more prog tracks that i 
like than breaks tracks. that really speaks volumes about how 
garbage breaks are.

youre just salty cause you like breaks.

i'm not salty at all - in fact, i am very sweet.

see the difference between me and someone who would argue with you, is 
that i know you have a god complex, and that it is pointless to attempt 
to convince you otherwise. therefore - i'll just throw out some 
sarcastic remarks once in a while to let you know that not everyone 
finds your opinion to be truth. beyond that - have fun insulting 
everything you want.

i: love breaks and other things that the gods of pb-cle say are bad, 
and am not afraid to admit it.

dori

i hope your kidding about that...a good friend of mine's mom got back 3times
what she gave doing black magic...ended up on crack and almost dead.

thats no joke.

magic isnt something to be taken lightly.

Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

I was thinking that as well.

Then I thought a little deeper... mostly they listed stuff that was =
"played" not stuff that was rubbish to begin with.

Jump 10 years into the future and tracks like "Shiny Disco Balls" and =
"At Night" will hold some sort of relevance.

Jump 10 years into the future and tracks like "The Launch", "Sandstorm", =
"Got the groove", etc. will be laughable.

WITH A WHISPER, NOT A BANG

By David Martin 12/24/2003
http://www.sacurrent.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10705756&BRD=2318&PAG=461&dept
_id=484045&rf1=8

Bush signs parts of Patriot Act II into law - stealthily

On December 13, when U.S. forces captured Saddam Hussein, President George
W. Bush not only celebrated with his national security team, but also pulled
out his pen and signed into law a bill that grants the FBI sweeping new
powers. A White House spokesperson explained the curious timing of the
signing - on a Saturday - as "the President signs bills seven days a week."
But the last time Bush signed a bill into law on a Saturday happened more
than a year ago - on a spending bill that the President needed to sign, to
prevent shutting down the federal government the following Monday.

By signing the bill on the day of Hussein's capture, Bush effectively
consigned a dramatic expansion of the USA Patriot Act to a mere footnote.
Consequently, while most Americans watched as Hussein was probed for head
lice, few were aware that the FBI had just obtained the power to probe their
financial records, even if the feds don't suspect their involvement in crime
or terrorism.

By signing the bill on the day of Hussein's capture, Bush effectively
consigned a dramatic expansion of the USA Patriot Act to a mere footnote.

The Bush Administration and its Congressional allies tucked away these new
executive powers in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004,
a legislative behemoth that funds all the intelligence activities of the
federal government. The Act included a simple, yet insidious, redefinition
of "financial institution," which previously referred to banks, but now
includes stockbrokers, car dealerships, casinos, credit card companies,
insurance agencies, jewelers, airlines, the U.S. Post Office, and any other
business "whose cash transactions have a high degree of usefulness in
criminal, tax, or regulatory matters."

Congress passed the legislation around Thanksgiving. Except for U.S.
Representative Charlie Gonzalez, all San Antonio's House members voted for
the act. The Senate passed it with a voice vote to avoid individual
accountability. While broadening the definition of "financial institution,"
the Bush administration is ramping up provisions within the 2001 USA Patriot
Act, which granted the FBI the authority to obtain client records from banks
by merely requesting the records in a "National Security Letter." To get the
records, the FBI doesn't have to appear before a judge, nor demonstrate
"probable cause" - reason to believe that the targeted client is involved in
criminal or terrorist activity. Moreover, the National Security Letters are
attached with a gag order, preventing any financial institution from
informing its clients that their records have been surrendered to the FBI.
If a financial institution breaches the gag order, it faces criminal
penalties. And finally, the FBI will no longer be required to report to
Congress how often they have used the National Security Letters.

Supporters of expanding the Patriot Act claim that the new law is necessary
to prevent future terrorist attacks on the U.S. The FBI needs these new
powers to be "expeditious and efficient" in its response to these new
threats. Robert Summers, professor of international law and director of the
new Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University, explains, "We don't
go to war with the terrorists as we went to war with the Germans or the
North Vietnamese. If we apply old methods of following the money, we will
not be successful. We need to meet them on an even playing field to avoid
another disaster."

Opponents of the PATRIOT Act and its expansion claim that safeguards like
judicial oversight and the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable
search and seizure, are essential to prevent abuses of power. "There's a
reason these protections were put into place," says Chip Berlet, senior
analyst at Political Research Associates, and a historian of U.S. political
repression. "It has been shown that if you give [these agencies] this power
they will abuse it. For any investigative agency, once you tell them that
they must make sure that they protect the country from subversives, it
inevitably gets translated into a program to silence dissent."

Opponents claim the FBI already has all the tools to stop crime and
terrorism. Moreover, explains Patrick Filyk, an attorney and vice president
of the local chapter of the ACLU, "The only thing the act accomplishes is
the removal of judicial oversight and the transfer of more power to law
enforcements agents."
This broadening of the Patriot Act represents a political victory for the
Bush Administration's stealth legislative strategy to increase executive
power. Last February, shortly before Bush launched the war on Iraq, the
Center for Public Integrity obtained a draft of a comprehensive expansion of
the Patriot Act, nicknamed Patriot Act II, written by Attorney General John
Ashcroft's staff. Again, the timing was suspicious; it appeared that the
Bush Administration was waiting for the start of the Iraq war to introduce
Patriot Act II, and then exploit the crisis to ram it through Congress with
little public debate.
The leak and ensuing public backlash frustrated the Bush administration's
strategy, so Ashcroft and Co. disassembled Patriot Act II, then reassembled
its parts into other legislation. By attaching the redefinition of
"financial institution" to an Intelligence Authorization Act, the Bush
Administration and its Congressional allies avoided public hearings and
floor debates for the expansion of the Patriot Act.

Even proponents of this expansion have expressed concern about these
legislative tactics. "It's a problem that some of these riders that are
added on may not receive the scrutiny that we would like to see," says St.
Mary's Professor Robert Summers.

The Bush Administration has yet to answer pivotal questions about its latest
constitutional coup: If these new executive powers are necessary to protect
United States citizens, then why would the legislation not withstand the
test of public debate? If the new act's provisions are in the public
interest, why use stealth in ramming them through the legislative process?

i've never gotten into the mechanics of how it does it, i give it a list 
of MIME types and it removes those.  i've seen a few oddball ones slip

multipart stuff.

do you really want to see how big sig files would be then???  not to 
mention with lookout and lookout express, HTML is a serious security risk...

I've got one of the new tracks. And have been waiting for this new batch for what seems like forever... I'm all about the drill n' bass... the DRILL n' bass!!! I don't know about NE Ohio being a good place to bring him, the majority of peeps who would be all about him are still all about the DRUM n' bass, lol

Dori, please.

Need we think logically and respectfully?

What a waste.

Rationality does no good here.

Opinions mean nothing when mixed with testosterone!

I am one to talk. I mean.. you know... I lift weights.




None of this matters because when we die we stop existing.



My e-mails mean so much.


...but yours doesn't. I found too many grammatical errors. You lose.

I am going to be handing out brand new cds as well, I just did one last
night!  so if you want one just come up to me and ask. I should have 3
different ones on me, but I'll have the most, quantity wise, of the new
one.  I'll make a post on here when I've uploaded it and put it on my

Subject: {pb-cle} WTF???

I wrote a letter to some of the new clubs down in Akron trying to educate 
them on the talent of dj's that the are has to offer, as well as possibly 
bringing in some big names.  This is the response I got from Posh(just 
thought some of you might find this interesting):

Mathew:

We have entertained the idea of having a headliner at the club as well as 
local talent. All of the management and DJ's here are all from the "90's 
rave era" and are expereinced as both DJ's and promoters. We understand the 
excitement of having progressive music in the club but frankly Akron is not 
ready for it. We have tried on numerous occasions to educate our clients but 
unfortunately, we steer towards top 40 and trance in order to please 
everyone. If we switched to a "club kid" crowd, we would loose our current 
clientele of 25-35 year olds who are upscale, educated and wealthy. Our 
clients are eager to buy martinis as opposed to a younger crowd who like to 
use substances other than liquor resulting in no money for the club. We have 
over 1500 clients on a Friday or Saturday night excited about our house DJ 
and it is working out nicely.

If you think you have other ways to increase our current income, we would be 
willing to entertain your ideas. Please forward a promo package and we will 
review what you have to offer.

Send to:

Thanks!

Steve

He's right except for the substance and age slams. Why should he as a
business give up a cliental of 1500 people on a Saturday. I can't remember
being a party with a turnout like that for a l o n g time. Did you talk to
him about a weekly or something?

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} WTF???

"this was my post to him"

I was just wondering if you plan on showcasing any of the local DJ talent.  
Our area has one of the richest DJ cultures around and it would be a shame 
not to utilize such a resource.  I have been running a weekly DJ showcase in 
Akron for the past few years and I have brought out nearly 200 different 
DJ's from all over Ohio and PA and I can definitely say that all these guys 
want is for a chance to let people hear them.  Also it would be nice to see 
some headlining acts be brought in.  It's working right now for places like 
Moda in Cleveland and Redzone in Columbus.  I think Akron is ripe for the 
picking and this could be the chance to expand your audience.  I've been 
down to Posh and I've really enjoyed myself.  I think you are barely seeing 
your potential though.  Just some friendly feedback.

Thanks,
Matthew

why is this surprising?  Actually, what I find surprising is that akron has 
a "upscale, educated and wealthy" crowd of people.

guess they have to make money.  you know they will close in less than a 
year anyway,

Because clubs cost money, and music catering to small crowds doesn't
exactly make much money.

I'm impressed the club owner/manager(?) mailed you the reply.

All I'm saying is that I love the music and the scene, I'm in the 25-35 year 
range, I've dropped my loot on plenty of liquor, and I'm not out there 
buying any drugs.  Anyway, I'm sure his club is already loaded down with 
drugs, I've seen just as many drugs being used in clubs like that.  I'm just 
sick of that representation because it doesn't represent me.

thats the beloved "rave scene" that everyone was so happy for when
things were booming in 98-00. now that aint shit happening there,
heads wonder why clubs arent into anything other than mainstream.
its funny, because there was plenty of opportunity for people to
stop that status quo of "young irresponsible ravers doing drugs,
etc etc" before it even started. however apathy and laziness won
and idiots ruined everything. now youre standing there with your
dick in your hand wondering why YOU have to pay the price. whats
that old saying? isnt it "if youre not part of the solution youre
part of the problem"? its too late to be the solution to a problem
that pretty much snuffed itself out.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} WTF???

hey I would just like to call them on something.  "clientele of 25-35 year
olds who are upscale, educated and wealthy". if they are so educated upscale
and wealthy then why do they fight like a group of highschool thugs?
has anyone ever driven past this place at night the cops are always there
breaking up fights if you want to see for your self just drive past on any
weekend night. We don't want to deal with clubs like that anyway. something
else about his reply "All of the management and DJ's here are all from the
"90's rave era"  the key word here is ERA beacuse another raver would not
speak of the scene like that. hold on in not done yet, Akron can't support
the upscale, wealthy scene. the club will be closed in less then a year and
a half i bet you all on that. ok we have are thing. we have Annabells we
have other places outside of akron like abbasso we have our dj's and our
music will never die so fuck everyone else we don't need them. you know i
think we should all go there sometime and crowd the place and buy like 1
drink and carry it around all night. well i thought i was done but i have
one more thing to say any most likely there dj's are playing burnt cd's they
downloaded and are not mixing at all just like the guy at eletra was we
should check this out because it would be some funny shit to see again. any
dj from out scene is better then what they could have. ok i think im done
here but if anyone wants to see me later i have more shit to talk!

{{ Matthew Coe <codered469@hotmail.com> }
Makes me sick that I spent any money going to that place. Uneducated
bastards!!! Why are all the morons in charge of clubs? }}

Slow down. There's no real credible complaint about clubs trying to fill the
house by catering to mainstream tastes, especially ones in small cities like
Akron. Overhead on places like that is high, and unless you can sell a bunch
of drinks to a bunch of repeat customers you're going to end up closing the
doors. The guy sounds educated to me - he understands that a club is a
business and not a venue of artistic or novel expression. All successful
restauranteurs understand it; you have to cater to popular tastes.

The nightclub industry is sustained by liquor sales, but it is marketed with
atmosphere, which includes music. I do think that Akron could sustain a
"rave" sort of club, but it would have to go the extra mile atmospherically
to draw the fence clientele. If you think you can pull it off, by all means
go ahead.

hey I would just like to call them on something. "clientele of 25-35 year
olds who are upscale, educated and wealthy". if they are so educated upscale
and wealthy then why do they fight like a group of highschool thugs? }}

Probably because they're all a bunch of poseurs. Here in the midwest,
"upscale" usually means that your club is full of narcissistic post-fratboy
douchebags who bought a striped white or blue dress shirt at the mall and
think it looks great with black shoes and pants, but who still wouldn't know
a decent martini if you smashed one over their gel-coated heads and then
stabbed them repeatedly in the eyes with the broken stem of the glass, so
they tote domestic beers or cran-vodkas around the club nodding to
kandytrance anthems that they don't like in the interest that they might be
able to grind their cocks on the ass of some unsuspecting drunken bitch and
convince themselves that she likes it until the lights come on and she
scurries back to her wallflower wannabe-thug boyfriend's perpetually crossed
arms like a cockroach diving through a hole in the baseboard. If that's not
a recipe for violence then I don't know what is.

Places that are actually upscale usually don't say it, by the way. And they
usually play good music.

Subject: {pb-cle} Las Vegas anyone?

Anybody feel like going to Vegas february 26th (thursday) through the 29th
(sunday)? Flight+hotel is between $450 and $900 right now if you want to
stay someplace decent. Got my eye on Treasure Island for $500 total
package... Good deal...

There's someone on this list who WAS going to go, but is a big punk.

from what ive learned about clubs.... its best to
offer a proposal to clubs when theyre limping from the
ass beating theyve recieved by everyone being A.D.D.
and not being able to resist the temptations of the
"newer, cooler" club opening up. get them while theyre
down... that way they will be desperate enough to give
just about anything a chance. but, youre still prolly
gonna have to play a cross over type of edm.

good luck,

i think i would be great to blow posh's system with nothing but post 98 
dillinja and ray keith tunes.

not only would they loose their asses on the bar...the club would be empty, 
and they'd have no sound...its the cleveland screw job!

This sounds like a letter that "Steve Zeneri" wrote in
order to create a contact with someone connected in
(and to) the area.  Not all clubs may start off as
what they intend to become and often become something
they never intended to be.  I see an opportunity here
to make a mark on an upper scale level.  I cannot see
many promoters having this chance in any mid-sized
market.  Show them what you are all about.  
Good Luck,

What laptop are you getting?  Most of them now offer wifi.

This is the spec you need to find:

Standards IEEE 802.11b

any device that receives/transmits this will work.

Yeah, any old 802.11b card will work, you might even look into an 802.11g
card. Harder, better, faster, stronger, backwards compatible. Ok, enough
with the daft punk references. Just avoid an 802.11a card, as it's not
compatable with either 802.11b or 802.11g.

Speaking of laptops, I've been trying to replace my broken powerbook that
costs $1100 to fix affordably, and I found these "desknote" computers
becoming quite popular. They're DIY laptops pretty much, although they come
assembled. EVERYTHING is an addon, but when you need a few, price is
important. The deal is that they're just portable computers, the battery is
an external add-on. A pain for some, but it can save you a few hundred
dollars by forgoing features you don't want from your manufacturer (like an
operating system, bundled software, etc.). Priced a decent 3Ghz one for
$1200 with a 15" LCD screen. Can't beat that.

Word,

Mike

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies
(these are moving into the ROM itself)

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sun Jan 18                       STARDUST 4                         Chitown

SUNDAY, JANUARY 18TH 2004 (Martin Luther King Weekend : No School / No 
Work Monday)

GLOBAL ADRENALINE & NORTHSTAR ENTERTAINMENT Present .....

STARDUST 4

On January 19th 2003 we brought together a collective unit of some of 
Electronic Music's Biggest Stars at the multicomplex venue, Oasis 160. 
With over 4,000 people in attendance, we showed what could happen when 
various artists of different genres, different backgrounds, and different 
personalities could bring to such a monumental event. The point of this 
event was to bring a large number of dj's, dancers, and supporters 
together in one common passion for music. This event proved that people, 
despite their differences on the outside, could easily co-exist to have a 
good time in the celebration of "free spirit, great music, and escape the 
not so always thrilling world that is life" As we embark on our FOURTH 
installment of this prestigious event, we too head in a different 
direction. One of more consciousness, and one that promises good times. On 
Sunday, January 18th 2004 come and join us once again at the Oasis 160 
multicomplex venue for what promises to be a night you will NEVER forget. 
Open up your minds, and let's all party together once more for the event 
that is properly titled "STARDUST". Its Back !!! 40 DJs, 4 Rooms, 1 
Experience !!! STARDUST 4 !!!

-- 40+ World Renowned DJs

Cold Crush Brothers:

  The Cold Crush Brothers is one of the most influential hip-hop groups 
of all times, renowned for their stage stomping performances and funky 
melodies. The Cold Crush Brothers have set the standards for hip-hop to 
come. Cold Crush Brothers appeared in the first hip-hop movie Wild Style. 
Wild Style which was released in the early 80's, featured graffiti, break 
dancing and the art of MC'ing and DJ'ing on film. The Cold Crush Brothers 
have appeared on singles with blastmaster KRS-ONE, Chuck D, of the world 
acclaimed Public Enemy, and Doug E Fresh, the World's Greatest 
Entertainer. The Cold Crush Brothers is known for its epic battles with 
Fantastic Five Mcee's in the world Famous Harlem World Entertainment 
Complex in the 80's. The Cold Crush Brothers was the first hip-hop group 
to rock stages abroad, taking their high energy stage show to Japan in the 
middle 80's. The Cold Crush Brothers original line up consisted of DJ 
Charlie Chase, DJ Tony Tone, The Cold Crush four Mcee's, Easy A.D, 
Almighty Kay Gee, Grandmaster Caz, and JDL. The Cold Crush Brother's 
strong rhymes and melodies show that the Cold Crush Brothers are the 
Rolling Stones of the hip-hop culture.

Dj Tony Tone:

    One of the most highly respected figures from the old skool era talks 
to Fatt JointZ exclusively about back in the day. DJ Tony Tone can be seen 
in the motion picture Wildstyle which was a movie made in the early 80's 
about the Hip Hop culture in New York City. Amongst the pioneers like 
Grand Master Flash, DJ Kool Herc, Bam and DST Tony Tone explains to us 
what was really going on and expresses some of his deep feelings towards 
the state of Hip Hop today. Tony Tone is the man who was behind the 
formation of the original Cold Crush Brothers. He recruited the great 
Grandmaster Caz, EZ-AD and other members to form this powerful group.

The Third Eye V.3
Cleveland, Oh

The Goahead Productions Third Eye series continues. With this edition
we revisit the dark and lovely aspects of techno and psytrance.


Lori the Hifi Princess – Psytech – Austria

International DJ Hi-Fi Princess, aka Lori Ward, has been establishing
herself in the underground party scene since 1993.

Having taken part in the ever-changing music scene throughout Europe
(England, Belgium, Germany, Macedonia, Slovenia, Austria, Spain, Croatia,
and Finland) Hi- Fi Princess's sound has evolved into a sophisticated mix
of techno and psychedelic music. She has spun with some of the biggest
names in techno/psy trance (Hallucinogen, Orion, Chris Liberator, Mark
E.G., G-force, Chris Liebing, Oscar Mulero, Futureshock, W.J Henze,
Franchesco Farfa, and Renato Cohen). She has also played at some of the
best clubs and festivals in the world.  (Tunnel-MYC, Liquid Club-Madrid,
Koneisto Festival-Finland, The Best-Zagreb, Ambasada Gavioli-Slovenia,
Mazzo-Amsterdam, Sona-Montreal Canada, Turbo-Toronto Canada, 1015
Folsom-San Francisco. Club Kuaille-Tokyo, Japan.Cittadella, Brno-
Czech.Stereodrome, Bratislava-Slovakia.Fever-Vienna.Nuke Festival-
Zwentendorf.Suncity, Graz)

Lori had her first release on Shimmy Recordings out of Bristol, U.K. Her
track, Refused Entry, was released June 12, 2000 on the Collective
Thoughts EP.  This E.P had great reviews in Wax, Out of Hand, Mixer
Magazine, and by some of the top DJs in the business.

Sequential Tom - www.futuretechartists.com/tom.html – U.S.A

'Sequential' Tom's involvement with electronic dance music began in the
early '90s when he moved to Amsterdam. His first experience at a 'house
party' pretty much charted the course of events: he started spending every
free minute in the record shops; he sold his electric guitar for a
Juno-106. Staying five years in Amsterdam, Tom relentlessly absorbed the
dance culture and eventually picked up the DJing habit and some production
experience.  In early '97 he packed his vinyl and headed back to New York
City, with an interest in bringing the european underground trance sound
to the States.  He landed a job at NYC's famous Throb records, where he
met members of the notorious Polymorphous crew. They began organizing
parties together, and Tom soon became a regular sight behind the decks on
Friday nights at the legendary club Vinyl, where he enjoyed a residency
with Polymorphous. During his tenure there he played alongside many great
acts from the trance scene. He's delivered on many of NYC's finest
dancefloors, at clubs like Vinyl, Speeed, Cream, Anseo, etc., and at
numerous parties. No stranger to airports, he's also played all over the
U.S. and Canada, in western and eastern Europe, and in Japan and Asia.  
Although Tom raised eyebrows and caught ears as an innovative, technical,
and cheeky DJ on the U.S. trance scene, his taste in DJing has since gone
in a more techno-oriented direction. His eclectic background still comes
through in his sets, but it is undeniably techno at the essence of every
moment.  Multifaceted, the man also works as a graphic artist and web
hack.  Accordingly his interest in the visual arts is developed, and is
seen to hold relation to all his musical endeavors.

....CHILD OF GAIA.... 

Your soul is lush and exploding with life.  Children of Gaia are driven to
sustain themselves and those around them with love.  Equipped with a
methodical and humanitarian heart you can accomplish any task and glean
the best results from it.

Being so attached to “your view” of nature and order can cause you to
create your own reality.  As a member of the cosmic race who makes worlds
real, it is good to believe in a greater plan beyond your own.  Stay aware
of your weakness.

Going with your heart is the key in this existence. You will always be
doing the right thing if you are being natural. Remember, you have
everything you will ever need at all times.  You are a physical expression
of the divine.

-Mickey Finn - london, UK - Jungle - Urban Takeover

Mickey started DJing in the late eighties and became well known with the 
advent of the Acid House movement in South London. He was given the name 
Mickey Finn because of his build by mates and friends in the scene. In the 
early nineties breakbeat and loose jungle techno was filling his record 
boxes as he travelled the length and breadth oh the UK. Such was the 
demand for his skills at this time by huge events all around the country 
he was even strarting to catch private planes between gigs. Mickey's 
production talents started off with Biting Back - She's Breaking Up then 
partnered Gavin and Claudio for Urban Shakedown - Some Justice. Now in the 
late nineties Mickey travels the world and throws down his vibe in 
countries like Japan, USA, Australia, Holland, Ibiza, Germany, Finland, 
Israel and France to name just a few.
Being at the helm of the UK drum and bass phenomenon means his record bags 
are full of the most upfront dubplates and latest releases from producers 
all around the world.

-Dioptrics w/ Ariel - DnB - DC area - www.focalpoint.to

It was 1997 when Ariel was exposed to Jungle/Drum n' Bass and the 
Minneapolis rave scene. 3D, Snuggles, Danny tha Wildchild, Slack, and 
Casper just name a few, were DJs out of the Chicago scene that influenced 
Ariel into DJing himself. He was officially hooked on the musical style 
known as Jungle/Drum n' Bass.
His sets vary from Progressive, to Ragga, to Hard, to Experimental and 
everything in between, always with some exclusive material of his own and 
always trying to keep his listeners on their toes. Recently he has been 
premiering numerous tracks of his on dub plates and will very soon play 
only on dub plates.
Though exposed to varied degrees of academic electronic music in school, 
Ariel's passion for Drum and Bass has landed him a permanent home in his 
studio where he spends a majority of his time. His style of production 
displays many influences such as UFO!, Aphex Twin, Goldie, Facs, and Klute 
just to name a few. Although writing within the structure of the DnB 
style, Ariel's concept of sound, color, timbre, and form are greatly 
derived from art/academic music. In writing Drum and Bass he is trying to 
achieve an equal blend of urban and artistic sounds, while keeping the 
listener in suspense and of course MOVING!!!


-Soniq Stylz - hard house/breaks - dayton - www.focalpoint.to

For the past eight years, Tim Hayes aka DJ Soniq Stylz has been honing his 
skills in the mid-west club scene, searching for the right combination of 
genres. Finding it in nu-skool breaks and hard house, Soniq is one to look 
for in the future. With several club residencies and main events under his 
belt, he has toured with the likes of Jesse Saunders, Delta 9, DJ Irene, 
DJ Rip, and DJ Kos Soniq also ran his own club night (called Activ8) and a 
series of after parties, featuring the likes of Titonton Duvante, DJ Rip, 
Diggabeats, Tilzs, Tronic, and Kid Entropy. Soniq is now taking his lively 
sets to the nationwide masses, in places like Detriot, Seattle, Texas and 
Chicago. Tim also dabbles in music production under the moniker Flogged 
Dolphin, knocking out local club favorites "Feel The Power", "Weapons", 
and "Bump". Having recently dropped "Just The Messenger", a double CD 
release, he is getting ready to add two new mixes, "Housewrecka v. 4" and 
"Disc Breaks".


-React - techno - cincy/chicago - www.subsonik.com / www.focalpoint.to

React is the driving force behind Subsonik Productions, a crew that has 
brought world class talent and high quality events to Ohio since 1998. 
Also one of the regions leading techno DJ's, his style varies from thought 
provoking minimal techno, to sophisticated tech-house, to floor driving 
techno. React's mixing style and technique is just as eclectic as his 
sound, and ranges from smooth and progressive in nature to a more Detroit 
influenced style of turntablism (tricks, cutting, backspins, etc). React 
has rocked a large number of clubs and parties, with numerous appearances 
in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Columbus, Dayton, his home town of 
Cincinnati, and others. React is currently focusing on 3 turntable mastery 
and 2 x 4 sets with other techno DJ's, in addition to building a studio to 
produce music.


-Mowgli - DnB - cincy - www.focalpoint.to

In over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and Jungle, 
Mowgli has held his ground as a forefather of the sound in the Mid-West. 
Along with Troll, they have been the epitome of excellent DJ's with proper 
knowledge and attitude. As of recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing 
drums and sampling loops. He has equipped artists such as 
A-Sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheads), Dylan & Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), 
MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with these drum breaks. Be sure to 
check out his event CHILLED, every Tuesday at the Bamboo Club in Newport, 
KY.


-Infinite Grey - cincy - house (live Pa) – www.focalpoint.to, 
www.linenoiz.com

John's technique to live performance is different from many live PA's. It 
includes live recording and manipulation of sequences and does not involve 
a computer or master sequencer. Instead, he uses separate sequencers to 
control each instrument (sampler, synthesizer, drum machine) 
independently, which allows for a degree of live improvisation. Because he 
produces and remixes material live, every performance is a unique 
experience. Over the past 3 years John has played at some of the largest 
parties and clubs around Ohio.


-Kenya DuBois - portland, OR - downtempo/trip-hop – www.focalpoint.to, 
Adore Recordings, Minus Two Crew

Kenya DuBois constantly explores and shares the audible nature of his
existence. As a Producer and Sound Designer, Kenya nurtures the
elements of ambience and atmosphere in his compositions with a diverse
catalogue of tones, frequencies and exploited daydreamed sounds. A mood
provoking and unique mixture of ambient textures and minimal beats
compliments his cerebral style of composing. Often inspired by the
overture of silence, Kenya expresses musically his vision of artistic
storytelling. Founder of Adore Recordings and Distorted Grooves and half
of the epiphanic collaborative, Popularity Contest Committee, Kenya
DuBois is an Ambassador of the atmospheric state of mind.


-Frankie J. - chicago – DnB – www.focalpoint.to

mental journey. She picks her tracks carefully, making sure each one is 
significant, whether it be to an event, a person, or a moment. So open 
your mind, pay attention, and let her show you the door to the next level.


-Oompaloompa - trance - cincy - Airplane Clique/ GSP Entertainment

Joshua Perry aka Oompa Loompa, has been a recognized force in the Midwest 
for nearly 3 years now. The Epic/Anthem/Hard Trance style Oompa Loompa 
brings to the tables have provided the masses of the mid-west with lasting 
memories of an epic journey worthy of Willy Wonka himself.

of Trance's fastest rising stars, Joshua has begun working on his 3rd 
release "Gobstoppers" which will include his original track I'm your dj

-CatNap - triphop/ jazz - columbus - mechaproductions

Starting his dj career in 1996 with hiphop and IDM shows on WKCO 91.9fm,
Catnap held residencies from New York City to London UK in the late 90's,
and has made his mark on Ohio's rave and club scenes since moving to
Columbus in 2000. He is known for a style that is very eclectic but always
a mix of gritty breakbeats, retro sounds, and jazzy textures. His newest
DJ mix, "Rendez-Vous", mixes instrumental hiphop with jazz, lounge, and
world music in the same vein as Mark Farina's "Mushroom Jazz" series.
Original tracks by Catnap will also be featured on GrooveReactor Records'
upcoming compilation, to be released in January.


-Phrenzy - DnB -rokitlabs.com - djphrenzy.com / www.GrooveReactor.com

Steve Gillson exited the womb wearing a set of Sennheisers, but it wasn't 
until late 1996 that he discovered his alter ego, DJ Phrenzy. After 
quickly adapting his musical knowledge to the art of performance, he 
garnered several residencies in Southern Ohio and joined forces with 
Groove Reactor Records. Since then Phrenzy has been lurking in the shadows 
of the midwest, making rare public appearances alongside the likes of 
Dieselboy to Darude. Phrenzy steps to the decks with a unique blend of 
harmonic euphony and technical precision that always moves the crowd. 
Don't miss this opportunity to witness a musical purist in action.


- Robotnik - jungle/ragga - Steel Arm Records - Kokomo, IN

An old Jungle soldier in the Ragga trenches since late 94, Robotnik was 
brought up on a steady diet of beats from such old skoolers as UFO!, 3D, 
and R.A.W. this newly revitalized Ragga Mercenary turned DJ will step to 
the decks for his premier after giving up his dues and working it to the 
fullest to fuse the new rising Ragga sound with the old dark hard Jungle 
of yesteryear gone by. This soldier will kill heads and murder a 
soundsystem all while smoking a spliff he probably found in one of his 
nappy dreads. Ragga Not Dead!


-ADubzz - turntableism - cincy - www.basisproductions.com

With his superb scratching skillz mixed with the best ol' school and 
recent hip-hop and DnB tracks, Adam's calm demeanor is not to be mistaken

If you're getting a newer model laptop, a lot of them have the network card
already integrated into the computer.  Just make sure it's a 802.11b (or g,
but these have yet to become standard...b will cure what ails you).
I vote Toshiba for your machine.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} WTF???

General problem of definitions.

Raves: Public drug/sex parties of thugs and criminals. Places where
teenagers go to overdose. Things that cops routinely break up.
 
You have to beat that stigmata and find a way to bring the music to the
table. Clubs that try and do what we are asking him to do close at an
alarming rate. Just on this list alone there are extreme elitist in terms of
what they will tolerate to listen to. Why would a business that survives on
packing a place full of bodies even entertain the though of catering to us.
Like someone else stated. He replied to you. He mentioned that he and his
staff would enjoy and have enjoyed what we want to do. Then he states he has
to fill the place and pay the bills. You don't open a business and hope just
to get by. Give the guy some credit. Sounds like one of the most
professional people in the "club" scene I have ever heard/read.

Remember this club is brand new.  Give it 6 months or so when the novelty of 
it being new has worn off.  People will get tired of paying west 6th prices 
in a Akron club.  Electra started out the same way.

Subject: {pb-cle} annabelles last night


Once again I have to say ohio is what's up!  Keep that place going man,
the crowd and energy there are always great.  Unfortunately we have almost
0 "rave" friendly 18+ kind of bars left here in Pittsburgh (none that I
know of anyway, other than the shadow lounge, which isn't a bar), so it is
always a good time to see the 18+ kids and the 21+ kids all having a
good time in one room.

Thanks to matt b and matt and dan and the whole crew for having me out
there, it was a blast as always.  good seeing luke and trout and moose and
crew as well!

Subject: {pb-cle} new dnb mix - "obsidian" - 160kbps mp3 / real audio


Here is the new mix, a new techno/etc mix is coming soon.  I threw this
together two nights ago, but it came out pretty decent in my opinion.
Some tougher joints than I have been putting on mixes normally, namely the
Angel III remix - which in my opinion is probably the best tune to come
out on Metalheadz in the last couple of years, as well as the D Kay tune
which follows it.  Hopefully this will be a trend with bringing back the
old skool drum programming and edits into "mainstream" dnb.  It gets
chilled out but not as vocally as usual, the smoother tracks have a lot
more grit and dubby basslines to them - particularly some of the hidden
agenda records I dug up for this.

ps. for those who heard me play at annabelles last night, some of the
tunes I played there are on this, being that I made it the night before,
they didn't leave my bag yet :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Local EDM scene

  I was just wondering how many people are into EDM in the Cleveland/Akron/Kent area?  I would love it if there was one big event that everyone would go to.  Or maybe I missed a big event like this already?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Local EDM scene

The first field day was estimated at over 1000, but that was area over one 
night, so it was easier to get a general idea.  I would probably say around 
800 - 1000 came to field day 2 over the total of 3 days

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP: Notacon technology event : April 23rd through 25th, 2004

Hey all,

I wanted to give the list a heads up on an event I and a number of other
people are through in April 23rd through 25th.  It's called Notacon and the
purpose is to explore technology, art, music and hopefully find some synergy
between them.  This is not party, not a rave nor is it a hacker convetion,
computer convetion or anything else of the sort.  However, it may have
elements of all of these and more.

We're currently seeking artists, performers and DJs who do unusual and
groundbreaking work to showcase their talent and art for our event.  We're
also inviting interested parties to attend the event.

For more information, including our call for proposals, please check out our
webpage:

http://www.notacon.org/

Thank you!

- Froggy

Yes, I believe its legal, but AC isn't in the building anymore so aI
don't know if the camera's are still working in the hallways.  They do
have parking lot secure, that=92s a plus.  I was looking into moving =
into
the building right across from the school - the Academy of court
reporting.  I was planning on talking a tour of the spaces he has
available soon.  I can get you that landlords number, I have to find it
though.

FRIDAY JANUARY 9th 2004
THE ANDY WARHOL MUSEUM presents

Pittsburgh's preeminent techno crew
TECHNOIR AUDIO live
featuring Shawn Rudiman

[ www.technoiraudio.com ]

Pittsburgh's Technoir Audio will perform a live set of
their heralded techno and electro music in the
museum's Entrance Gallery. Shawn Rudiman, founder
of Technoir Audio, will lead his team of electronic
musicians, DJs, live acoustic musicians and
video-mixers in this improvised electronic music
event.

In 1989 Shawn Rudiman started production work with Ed
Vargo on Total Harmonic Distortion, an E.B.M.
("electronic body music") unit that became quite
popular in the industrial scene of the early to mid
1990's, releasing 4 full-length albums, countless
remixes and compilation releases on European
and domestic labels. These productions, coupled with
Mr. Rudiman's fascination with the sound and design of
early analog electronic music machines led him to
techno music. In 1997 he relocated to Pittsburgh,
retired his worn out industrial/E.B.M. aesthetic
ideals and shifted his electronic music productions
towards pure rhythm and sounds. This transition
period was difficult due to a scaling back of sound
layers and refinement of rhythms, but the results
proved positive. Multi-hour live studio techno
improvisations led to live club performances with his
studio gear--as fluid and smooth as any DJ set, but
entirely flexible in direction and tempo. 

His association with Trevor Combee and Pittsburgh's
Hypervinyl records led to the release of his
productions on labels such as 7th City. In 2000, Mr.
Rudiman and Jwan Allen have started their own label
and live electronic dance music production team,
Technoir Audio. In addition to his live
production performances with Technoir Audio, Mr.
Rudiman continues to DJ around the U.S. and recently
returned from his second DJ tour of Europe.

All-Ages. Show starts promptly at 6pm. Ends at 10:00
pm.

$5 Cover.

Hey All,

Just wanted to spread the good word...A bunch of us (Fame, Spin Cycle, 
5Star, and Bassheads) are throwing a benefit for Kevin Hyatt in Kent next 
Sat. (1-17-04) If anyone knows him, or is interested in seeing some good 
music for a good cause -- def. make your way down to Kent. The event will be 
at the Robin Hood and will feature Tigger, 7up, Elysium, Mike Love, Evan 
Evolution and Slim Pickins.

Kevin was a friend of many in the EDM scene and an avid scene supporter. 
Currently, he can use all the help he can get. He's been in a coma for about 
a year and his expenses are mounting. It is our hope to raise some money for 
his family and establish a fund for him that evening.

Hope to see ya' at the show.You can send questions, etc. to:

no one wants to see this crap Adam.

why dont you post about a real show...like the Blues Traveller 
concert coming to town, or .25 cent drafts down in the strip 
district. for real... Who really wants to see a few DJ's rock it 
with some Live PA, and some live instrumentation & Video all 
synched up together? ...the idea is so.....  Yawn, Mr Ratana.

Subject: {pb-cle} TITONTON :: HOT SHIT :: TECHNOIR :: JAN 17TH

This is your reminder that in 8 days Hot Shit productions brings 
to the pittsburgh massive:

Saturday, January 17th, 10pm-3am The Shadow Lounge in East Liberty 
(Pittsburgh).
$5

Titonton doing a LIVE PA along side his drummer, Don Carlos, 
playing LIVE - This is a rare and unique experience that you'd be 
hard pressed to find happening anywhere else except Titonton's 
Studio.

Technoir Audio playing a hybrid LIVE / deejay set - Shawn Rudiman 
et al bringing it to you crazy and LIVE for the moment.

The night will be opened and closed by the party rocker, Jim 
Selecta, resident at Havana Friday nights... 

The venue is all ages, you can bring your own alcohol if you 
choose, they also have a mini bar that they serve for donations 
that has everything from water, to juices, to beer.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: High Rollers?

Another, smaller gambling opportunity for car enthusiasts next week.

Last year was my first year at the North American International Auto Show,
and as close as Detroit is, I wouldn't miss it for the world. All the new
heat is always there long before it sees a showroom. Some of the shit from
last year I still haven't seen yet. The other nice thing you've got going on
there is Casino Windsor right across the river, so my plan is to spend
saturday throwing dice in the casino and then sunday going to the car show
and heading home. Rooms at the casino are almost $300 a night, not too bad
if you split it with someone. The auto show is $12 and is at COBO center
(DEMF'ers should know where this is).

Obviously there are cheaper hotels in the area, but tentatively I plan to
stay at the casino.

By the way, is Movement happening this year? Anyone know?

Its funny those Japanese companies plan things for hundreds of years into
the future.  They don't look so much at the short term.  I think that robot
came out a couple of years ago because I remember seeing it before.  I just
don't remember when.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: High Rollers?

They had footage of this on the screensavers on techtv a while back. Most of
the ASIMO innovations only took place in the last few years of it's
development, because they couldn't figure out that it had to shift its
weight while walking. If you look around the intarweb, you can also find an
ASIMO video of it climbing stairs -- only backwards!

Since they've learned that people move in the way they do so they don't fall
down, ASIMO really mimics the way people move, hence it looking like a
midget in a robot suit. The processor power inside this thing is INSANE to
keep it moving right.

Now that I've gotten the nerd part out of the way, I need two of these
things so I can have rockem sockem robots in my living room. w00t!

Subject: {pb-cle} Much luv to my Kent ppl

hey that's great you are having a benefit ... and it
just so happens to be on my birthday! i'm actually
heading up to see Derrick Carter in Cleveland so don't
know if i'll have time to stop by. I'm also going to
try to make it to see Derrick on the 18th in Columbus
as well.

anthony .. if you can talk to Evan and anyone else up
there about possibly doing an ad in Bassline, we are
still in desperate need of advertising!!! You can
e-mail me at contactbassline@hotmail.com I think it
would be great to advertise if you are doing nights
again at the Robin Hood or at Annabell's.

lemme know! holla back!!!!
Steph

yea, good time. but you gotta watch out for trout or he'll steal your 
hoodie.

diggabeat's set was kinda weak though. also I was kinda hoping to get a copy
of the new cd, $10 is a little steep though, his last cd was 
professionally done
and he was handing the suckers out all over.

My pics are up:
(main page) http://parties.vrillusions.com/
(direct link) http://parties.vrillusions.com/gallery/release 

Also, I'm going to start commenting all the images with who's in all 
of them.  And since I really suck at names, I'm going to have a lot 
of ?? in there.  If you see anyone that you know who they are, email 
me and let me know (more info on main page).

It was great to see a bunch of old faces at Release.  Dez ended up breaking 
even and then some.  Great turnout for his first party.  I didn't have any 
involvement in the party  - Dez just asked me to work the door.  Yep, I was the 
one taking your money, finding your name on the list, attaching your bracelets, 
watching your clothes/cell phones, and partially losing my mind.  :)

Anyway, I did get to catch Diggabeatz's set, but I was too pooped to even 
think about dancing.  I must say I was excited to see and hear him after it's 
been so long, but it didn't blow me away.  Plus, something kept happening with 
his mixes - I think it had to do with the audio setup.  One track would sound 
way louder and having higher highs than the other.  But whatever.  Seemed like 
pretty much everyone was having fun.  Hopefully they saved me one of those 
blow-up kids because I got tired of waiting for the moment they were supposed to 
drop them.  Analogue, if you're out there - you'd better have one for me.  :)

Yeah, Eric's CDs were $10, but if you were there at the end of the night he 
was probably giving them out.  He said he probably would since they weren't 
selling.  I know in the past they've been cheap or free, but he told me he had to 
sell some of those.  Don't know why.  

I hope everyone had fun.  :)  Nice to have a great party in my own town again.

GM recalls over 800,000 cars
Power-steering problems citedThe Associated Press
Updated: 9:48 a.m. ET Jan. 12, 2004DETROIT - General
Motors Corp. is recalling more than 800,000 cars
because of a power steering defect that has may have
led to eight injuries.

advertisement
 
About 750,000 cars in the United States and about
55,000 in Canada — all made between Jan. 1, 1996 and
Oct. 31, 1997 — are affected, GM said Monday.

The models are the 1996 Buick Regal, 1997 Oldsmobile
Cutlass Supreme, 1997-98 Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet
Lumina, Monte Carlo, Malibu, and 1998 Oldsmobile
Intrigue cars. Also, some 1996 Pontiac Grand Prix and
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and 1997-98 Buick Regal
cars are being recalled.

Drivers have experienced intermittent losses of power
steering when making left turns, especially at low
speeds, GM said. Some drivers could experience higher
resistance when turning left, followed by unintended
power assist to the right, the company said.

Eight nonfatal injuries have been reported that may be
related to the defect, the automaker said.

GM will begin instructing car owners in February to
bring the affected vehicles to dealers for repairs.

Subject: RE: Re: {pb-cle} Moda?

I think Moda has been taking some steps in the right direction, most recently namely by easing up on the dress code and opening the music up to new audiences by allowing 19+. 

I have to admit that when it first opened I was really disappointed because my expectations were really high; I had wanted my Space and Vinyl (ARC) substitute and all I felt was icky vibe. (It was hard to remember the wise words of Dad who said that comparisons can only make you miserable!)

But, Dave and I went last Fall to hear Kazell, and there were some noticeable improvements even then. The bartender I had that night was extremely courteous, the bouncers/floor sweepers were more discreet, and most importantly, the crowd was really into the music. There were less people there to see and be seen and more people there to hear the music and to dance. The vibe was thicker.

A lot of clubs just take time to find their spot and keep it in balance; I'm really looking forward to things going off there in the coming month!

I had a good time at Release. The music for the most part was not to my

been to in Akron and the first in over 5 years.

Good to see everyone had fun Sat. night... I got
caught up in the Patriots-Titans game, but generally I
just haven't been in the mood to go out or socialize
at all. Just really into relaxing and staying warm
right now!!!

The Third Eye V.3
Cleveland, Oh

The Goahead Productions Third Eye series continues. With this edition
we revisit the dark and lovely aspects of techno and psytrance.


Lori the Hifi Princess – Psytech – Austria

International DJ Hi-Fi Princess, aka Lori Ward, has been establishing
herself in the underground party scene since 1993.

Having taken part in the ever-changing music scene throughout Europe
(England, Belgium, Germany, Macedonia, Slovenia, Austria, Spain, Croatia,
and Finland) Hi- Fi Princess's sound has evolved into a sophisticated mix
of techno and psychedelic music. She has spun with some of the biggest
names in techno/psy trance (Hallucinogen, Orion, Chris Liberator, Mark
E.G., G-force, Chris Liebing, Oscar Mulero, Futureshock, W.J Henze,
Franchesco Farfa, and Renato Cohen). She has also played at some of the
best clubs and festivals in the world. (Tunnel-MYC, Liquid Club-Madrid,
Koneisto Festival-Finland, The Best-Zagreb, Ambasada Gavioli-Slovenia,
Mazzo-Amsterdam, Sona-Montreal Canada, Turbo-Toronto Canada, 1015
Folsom-San Francisco. Club Kuaille-Tokyo, Japan.Cittadella, Brno-
Czech.Stereodrome, Bratislava-Slovakia.Fever-Vienna.Nuke Festival-
Zwentendorf.Suncity, Graz)

Lori had her first release on Shimmy Recordings out of Bristol, U.K. Her
track, Refused Entry, was released June 12, 2000 on the Collective
Thoughts EP. This E.P had great reviews in Wax, Out of Hand, Mixer
Magazine, and by some of the top DJs in the business.

http://www.sistersf.com/guestDJs/hifiprincess.php

Sequential Tom - www.futuretechartists.com/tom.html – U.S.A

'Sequential' Tom's involvement with electronic dance music began in the
early '90s when he moved to Amsterdam. His first experience at a 'house
party' pretty much charted the course of events: he started spending every
free minute in the record shops; he sold his electric guitar for a
Juno-106. Staying five years in Amsterdam, Tom relentlessly absorbed the
dance culture and eventually picked up the DJing habit and some production
experience. In early '97 he packed his vinyl and headed back to New York
City, with an interest in bringing the european underground trance sound
to the States. He landed a job at NYC's famous Throb records, where he
met members of the notorious Polymorphous crew. They began organizing
parties together, and Tom soon became a regular sight behind the decks on
Friday nights at the legendary club Vinyl, where he enjoyed a residency
with Polymorphous. During his tenure there he played alongside many great
acts from the trance scene. He's delivered on many of NYC's finest
dancefloors, at clubs like Vinyl, Speeed, Cream, Anseo, etc., and at
numerous parties. No stranger to airports, he's also played all over the
U.S. and Canada, in western and eastern Europe, and in Japan and Asia.
Although Tom raised eyebrows and caught ears as an innovative, technical,
and cheeky DJ on the U.S. trance scene, his taste in DJing has since gone
in a more techno-oriented direction. His eclectic background still comes
through in his sets, but it is undeniably techno at the essence of every
moment. Multifaceted, the man also works as a graphic artist and web
hack. Accordingly his interest in the visual arts is developed, and is
seen to hold relation to all his musical endeavors.

....CHILD OF GAIA....

Your soul is lush and exploding with life. Children of Gaia are driven to
sustain themselves and those around them with love. Equipped with a
methodical and humanitarian heart you can accomplish any task and glean
the best results from it.

Being so attached to “your view” of nature and order can cause you to
create your own reality. As a member of the cosmic race who makes worlds
real, it is good to believe in a greater plan beyond your own. Stay aware
of your weakness.

Going with your heart is the key in this existence. You will always be
doing the right thing if you are being natural. Remember, you have
everything you will ever need at all times. You are a physical expression
of the divine.

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

no shania twain.  that's too easy.

i say something like "who's your daddy" by toby keith ... (cause i can
totally see someone adding in the 'come to fucking daddy' sample)

or a fun sing along song like 'friends in low places'

devil went down to georgia would make a pretty good dnb tune if done
right...

bet some midi of gold against your soul that says i'm better than you.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} gone country... was Re: {pb-cle} Space Monkey Reward Offered

The Devil Went Down to the Speed Garage.

Speaking of Speed Garage, I was driving down Grandview Ave. here in Columbus
the other day, and saw a auto shop called "The Speed Factory". There was a
giant sign and an arrow spraypainted to the door that said "We Make Speed
Here". Pictures to come, when I can get there and it's not dark.

Doug, I got an email from you stating this particular event =

staying at! http://www.thekenthotel.com/photogallery.html=20

I think I'll be down there from March 5th - 9th. Anyone thats interested =

I know many of you have heard and seen this already (perhaps many times) but I'm excited and thus wanted to post a reminder. 
 
Plate Tectonics is THIS Friday @ Abbasso (the 16th).  It's the inagural event for the new techno monthly.  Details are all on the ROM (Thank you Trout!).
Just a reminder, our awesome friends from the goahead crew, along with Damon Havill will be supplying the kicking, banging tunes for the evening.  (And I've heard much talk, of mucho #'s of really cool new records)
 
Pb-cle'ers introduce yourself.  (And some people I personally have met before, please re-introduce yourself to me...if I met you late night my visual recollection of you will suck, but I will remember who you are)
 
There's a lot of list people either involved in promoting/playing at these events, many of whom are supportive of others...so def. lend them some support too. : )
 
FREE glow-straws to the first 25 pb-cle people who attend..that you may stick in your Tall Pauls then proceed to get silly.  (Note: this action is in no way whatsoever endorsed by the *real* event promoters, nor the DJ's...I, lame, silly girl take full responsiblity, due to my affliction for stupid glowing objects, for said such action)---oh, and please don't let that be a deterrent....if you really don't want one I won't force them on you. ; )  In fact, one before-mentioned promoter, who shall go unnamed will probably make me hide the darn things. 
 
 


Did you know that you are more likely to be killed by a champagne cork than by a poisonous spider

"Tear in My Beer" by the master of CnW, Hank Williams Senior.  Mabey I 
should break those files back out.

Movim is my friend Patrick Turner's label.  I would give anything to go...
sigh... but not this year. If I get things together enough to go... it will
be very last minute.

Anyone going this year? I'll be heading down (driving) but I'm not sure
who's all coming with me yet. Every year, people say they'll go and back out
at the last minute.

Doug, I got an email from you stating this particular event
http://www.movim.com/ Thats actually being held in the hotel we're staying
at! http://www.thekenthotel.com/photogallery.html

I think I'll be down there from March 5th - 9th. Anyone thats interested in
going, is so welcomed from the list. (If ride situations is a problem.)

Subject: {pb-cle} Another fun filled weekend in Cleveland!!!!!!

Alright, here's the deal.  Its another weekend of fun and exciting things to
do.  A big BOO to everyone who says there is nothing to do here in
Cleveland.  Get on the phone, and invite some friends out because there is
no reason to sit at home.  Here's the deal....

THURSDAY:  If you want to start the weekend early there are two options:
GLITCH KLIQUE @ Karma (http://www.karmanightclub.net/ ) with Bonita (dlp)
and Reese - OR - LOCAL 13 @ Abbasso which is their open tables night and you
never know who might show up.

FRIDAY:  The long awaited PLATE TECHTONICS give real techno a home once a
month @ Abbasso.  This month features ANDY JAMES, BOOMPSIE, MEGHAN and DAMON
HAVILL.  - also - Classic Records head LUKE SOLOMON will be @ Wish getting
you warmed up for Saturday along with STILL LIFE and MIKE METZ.

SATURDAY:  So much to do.   DERRICK CARTER, returns to Cleveland for RITUAL
@ MODA along with misterbradleyp and myself.   This is a rare treat, and
Derrick is an amazingly talented dj. I highly suggest you check it out!  -
also - at the robin hood in kent there will be a benefit for KEVIN HYATT who
has been in a coma for nearly a year and you can contact evan evolution for
more info on the event or how to help if you can not attend.

SUNDAY:  The third installment of 10 hours, 10 djs is taking place.  This
time around we get to experience: BONITA (DLP), BRIRI, CHRIS EBERHART, CLOUD
TEN, JOESEPH, MIKE FILLY, MISTERBRADLEYP, REESE, THOMAR, and TROUT
SOUP! -also- RITUAL SUNDAY is happening in Columbus which is where I would
be if I had the chance... always a worthwhile trip.

This is going to be a great night @ Abbasso!!  It’s nice to see different genres on different nights.  I had a blast at Moose’s Friday Night Breaks, and I know this is going to be another monthly not to be missed.  I’m so glad to see so many great events going on this weekend.  Hope to see everyone out and about!!

Thanks people! I'm very excited for this event.  I've been yearning to hear techno in Cleveland.  

Props to Damon for making the flyers!  He spent all last night working on flyers for March.  

Please feel free to sign our guestbook at:
http://www.geocities.com/clevetechno/plate_tectonics.html

Also this Friday, find out who our headliner will be for March!

There's a lot of list people either involved in promoting/playing at these events, many of whom are supportive of others...so def. lend them some support too.

FREE glow-straws to the first 25 pb-cle people who attend..that you may stick in your Tall Pauls then proceed to get silly.

I'm actually starting to get a bit excited for this,

Something else of note:  Everyone playing on friday
will have 3 tables and a CDJ1000 available to work
with, so I expect to hear some crazy shit coming
through the speakers.

Dave and I and our crews from New York and Connecticut will be
there...Hopefully a lot of fun interspersed with the work...We have a bunch
of stuff to do this year! Anyone from this list going, please PM me your
e-mail address and we'll try to hook you up with events we're involved with
and get at least one time where we can all meet up down there.

Anyone going this year? I'll be heading down (driving) but I'm not sure
who's all coming with me yet. Every year, people say they'll go and back out
at the last minute.

Doug, I got an email from you stating this particular event
http://www.movim.com/ Thats actually being held in the hotel we're staying
at! http://www.thekenthotel.com/photogallery.html

I think I'll be down there from March 5th - 9th. Anyone thats interested in
going, is so welcomed from the list. (If ride situations is a problem.)

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies
(these are moving into the ROM itself)

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

GLOBAL ADRENALINE & NORTHSTAR ENTERTAINMENT Present .....

STARDUST 4

On January 19th 2003 we brought together a collective unit of some of 
Electronic Music's Biggest Stars at the multicomplex venue, Oasis 160. 
With over 4,000 people in attendance, we showed what could happen when 
various artists of different genres, different backgrounds, and different 
personalities could bring to such a monumental event. The point of this 
event was to bring a large number of dj's, dancers, and supporters 
together in one common passion for music. This event proved that people, 
despite their differences on the outside, could easily co-exist to have a 
good time in the celebration of "free spirit, great music, and escape the 
not so always thrilling world that is life" As we embark on our FOURTH 
installment of this prestigious event, we too head in a different 
direction. One of more consciousness, and one that promises good times. On 
Sunday, January 18th 2004 come and join us once again at the Oasis 160 
multicomplex venue for what promises to be a night you will NEVER forget. 
Open up your minds, and let's all party together once more for the event 
that is properly titled "STARDUST". Its Back !!! 40 DJs, 4 Rooms, 1 
Experience !!! STARDUST 4 !!!

-- 40+ World Renowned DJs
-- Stunning Visual Effects
-- Latest Technological Innovations
-- ICandy: Spectacular Visuals & Attractions

Cold Crush Brothers:

  The Cold Crush Brothers is one of the most influential hip-hop groups 
of all times, renowned for their stage stomping performances and funky 
melodies. The Cold Crush Brothers have set the standards for hip-hop to 
come. Cold Crush Brothers appeared in the first hip-hop movie Wild Style. 
Wild Style which was released in the early 80's, featured graffiti, break 
dancing and the art of MC'ing and DJ'ing on film. The Cold Crush Brothers 
have appeared on singles with blastmaster KRS-ONE, Chuck D, of the world 
acclaimed Public Enemy, and Doug E Fresh, the World's Greatest 
Entertainer. The Cold Crush Brothers is known for its epic battles with 
Fantastic Five Mcee's in the world Famous Harlem World Entertainment 
Complex in the 80's. The Cold Crush Brothers was the first hip-hop group 
to rock stages abroad, taking their high energy stage show to Japan in the 
middle 80's. The Cold Crush Brothers original line up consisted of DJ 
Charlie Chase, DJ Tony Tone, The Cold Crush four Mcee's, Easy A.D, 
Almighty Kay Gee, Grandmaster Caz, and JDL. The Cold Crush Brother's 
strong rhymes and melodies show that the Cold Crush Brothers are the 
Rolling Stones of the hip-hop culture.

Dj Tony Tone:

    One of the most highly respected figures from the old skool era talks 
to Fatt JointZ exclusively about back in the day. DJ Tony Tone can be seen 
in the motion picture Wildstyle which was a movie made in the early 80's 
about the Hip Hop culture in New York City. Amongst the pioneers like 
Grand Master Flash, DJ Kool Herc, Bam and DST Tony Tone explains to us 
what was really going on and expresses some of his deep feelings towards 
the state of Hip Hop today. Tony Tone is the man who was behind the 
formation of the original Cold Crush Brothers. He recruited the great 
Grandmaster Caz, EZ-AD and other members to form this powerful group.

[my unofficial birthday party!]

Friday, Feb 27 2004
The Third Eye V.3
Cleveland, Oh

The Goahead Productions Third Eye series continues. With this edition
we revisit the dark and lovely aspects of techno and psytrance.


Lori the Hifi Princess – Psytech – Austria

International DJ Hi-Fi Princess, aka Lori Ward, has been establishing
herself in the underground party scene since 1993.

Having taken part in the ever-changing music scene throughout Europe
(England, Belgium, Germany, Macedonia, Slovenia, Austria, Spain, Croatia,
and Finland) Hi- Fi Princess's sound has evolved into a sophisticated mix
of techno and psychedelic music. She has spun with some of the biggest
names in techno/psy trance (Hallucinogen, Orion, Chris Liberator, Mark
E.G., G-force, Chris Liebing, Oscar Mulero, Futureshock, W.J Henze,
Franchesco Farfa, and Renato Cohen). She has also played at some of the
best clubs and festivals in the world.  (Tunnel-MYC, Liquid Club-Madrid,
Koneisto Festival-Finland, The Best-Zagreb, Ambasada Gavioli-Slovenia,
Mazzo-Amsterdam, Sona-Montreal Canada, Turbo-Toronto Canada, 1015
Folsom-San Francisco. Club Kuaille-Tokyo, Japan.Cittadella, Brno-
Czech.Stereodrome, Bratislava-Slovakia.Fever-Vienna.Nuke Festival-
Zwentendorf.Suncity, Graz)

Lori had her first release on Shimmy Recordings out of Bristol, U.K. Her
track, Refused Entry, was released June 12, 2000 on the Collective
Thoughts EP.  This E.P had great reviews in Wax, Out of Hand, Mixer
Magazine, and by some of the top DJs in the business.

http://www.sistersf.com/guestDJs/hifiprincess.php

Sequential Tom - www.futuretechartists.com/tom.html – U.S.A

'Sequential' Tom's involvement with electronic dance music began in the
early '90s when he moved to Amsterdam. His first experience at a 'house
party' pretty much charted the course of events: he started spending every
free minute in the record shops; he sold his electric guitar for a
Juno-106. Staying five years in Amsterdam, Tom relentlessly absorbed the
dance culture and eventually picked up the DJing habit and some production
experience.  In early '97 he packed his vinyl and headed back to New York
City, with an interest in bringing the european underground trance sound
to the States.  He landed a job at NYC's famous Throb records, where he
met members of the notorious Polymorphous crew. They began organizing
parties together, and Tom soon became a regular sight behind the decks on
Friday nights at the legendary club Vinyl, where he enjoyed a residency
with Polymorphous. During his tenure there he played alongside many great
acts from the trance scene. He's delivered on many of NYC's finest
dancefloors, at clubs like Vinyl, Speeed, Cream, Anseo, etc., and at
numerous parties. No stranger to airports, he's also played all over the
U.S. and Canada, in western and eastern Europe, and in Japan and Asia.  
Although Tom raised eyebrows and caught ears as an innovative, technical,
and cheeky DJ on the U.S. trance scene, his taste in DJing has since gone
in a more techno-oriented direction. His eclectic background still comes
through in his sets, but it is undeniably techno at the essence of every
moment.  Multifaceted, the man also works as a graphic artist and web
hack.  Accordingly his interest in the visual arts is developed, and is
seen to hold relation to all his musical endeavors.

....CHILD OF GAIA.... 

Your soul is lush and exploding with life.  Children of Gaia are driven to
sustain themselves and those around them with love.  Equipped with a
methodical and humanitarian heart you can accomplish any task and glean
the best results from it.

Being so attached to “your view” of nature and order can cause you to
create your own reality.  As a member of the cosmic race who makes worlds
real, it is good to believe in a greater plan beyond your own.  Stay aware
of your weakness.

Going with your heart is the key in this existence. You will always be
doing the right thing if you are being natural. Remember, you have
everything you will ever need at all times.  You are a physical expression
of the divine.

-Mickey Finn - london, UK - Jungle - Urban Takeover

Mickey started DJing in the late eighties and became well known with the 
advent of the Acid House movement in South London. He was given the name 
Mickey Finn because of his build by mates and friends in the scene. In the 
early nineties breakbeat and loose jungle techno was filling his record 
boxes as he travelled the length and breadth oh the UK. Such was the 
demand for his skills at this time by huge events all around the country 
he was even strarting to catch private planes between gigs. Mickey's 
production talents started off with Biting Back - She's Breaking Up then 
partnered Gavin and Claudio for Urban Shakedown - Some Justice. Now in the 
late nineties Mickey travels the world and throws down his vibe in 
countries like Japan, USA, Australia, Holland, Ibiza, Germany, Finland, 
Israel and France to name just a few.
Being at the helm of the UK drum and bass phenomenon means his record bags 
are full of the most upfront dubplates and latest releases from producers 
all around the world.

Assassin shows you what its truly about. Known throughout the East and no 
stranger to the Midwest, his special brand of hard acid trance house &

-Dioptrics w/ Ariel - DnB - DC area - www.focalpoint.to

It was 1997 when Ariel was exposed to Jungle/Drum n' Bass and the 
Minneapolis rave scene. 3D, Snuggles, Danny tha Wildchild, Slack, and 
Casper just name a few, were DJs out of the Chicago scene that influenced 
Ariel into DJing himself. He was officially hooked on the musical style 
known as Jungle/Drum n' Bass.
His sets vary from Progressive, to Ragga, to Hard, to Experimental and 
everything in between, always with some exclusive material of his own and 
always trying to keep his listeners on their toes. Recently he has been 
premiering numerous tracks of his on dub plates and will very soon play 
only on dub plates.
Though exposed to varied degrees of academic electronic music in school, 
Ariel's passion for Drum and Bass has landed him a permanent home in his 
studio where he spends a majority of his time. His style of production 
displays many influences such as UFO!, Aphex Twin, Goldie, Facs, and Klute 
just to name a few. Although writing within the structure of the DnB 
style, Ariel's concept of sound, color, timbre, and form are greatly 
derived from art/academic music. In writing Drum and Bass he is trying to 
achieve an equal blend of urban and artistic sounds, while keeping the 
listener in suspense and of course MOVING!!!


-Soniq Stylz - hard house/breaks - dayton - www.focalpoint.to

For the past eight years, Tim Hayes aka DJ Soniq Stylz has been honing his 
skills in the mid-west club scene, searching for the right combination of 
genres. Finding it in nu-skool breaks and hard house, Soniq is one to look 
for in the future. With several club residencies and main events under his 
belt, he has toured with the likes of Jesse Saunders, Delta 9, DJ Irene, 
DJ Rip, and DJ Kos Soniq also ran his own club night (called Activ8) and a 
series of after parties, featuring the likes of Titonton Duvante, DJ Rip, 
Diggabeats, Tilzs, Tronic, and Kid Entropy. Soniq is now taking his lively 
sets to the nationwide masses, in places like Detriot, Seattle, Texas and 
Chicago. Tim also dabbles in music production under the moniker Flogged 
Dolphin, knocking out local club favorites "Feel The Power", "Weapons", 
and "Bump". Having recently dropped "Just The Messenger", a double CD 
release, he is getting ready to add two new mixes, "Housewrecka v. 4" and 
"Disc Breaks".


-React - techno - cincy/chicago - www.subsonik.com / www.focalpoint.to

React is the driving force behind Subsonik Productions, a crew that has 
brought world class talent and high quality events to Ohio since 1998. 
Also one of the regions leading techno DJ's, his style varies from thought 
provoking minimal techno, to sophisticated tech-house, to floor driving 
techno. React's mixing style and technique is just as eclectic as his 
sound, and ranges from smooth and progressive in nature to a more Detroit 
influenced style of turntablism (tricks, cutting, backspins, etc). React 
has rocked a large number of clubs and parties, with numerous appearances 
in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Columbus, Dayton, his home town of 
Cincinnati, and others. React is currently focusing on 3 turntable mastery 
and 2 x 4 sets with other techno DJ's, in addition to building a studio to 
produce music.


-Mowgli - DnB - cincy - www.focalpoint.to

In over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and Jungle, 
Mowgli has held his ground as a forefather of the sound in the Mid-West. 
Along with Troll, they have been the epitome of excellent DJ's with proper 
knowledge and attitude. As of recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing 
drums and sampling loops. He has equipped artists such as 
A-Sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheads), Dylan & Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), 
MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with these drum breaks. Be sure to 
check out his event CHILLED, every Tuesday at the Bamboo Club in Newport, 
KY.


-Infinite Grey - cincy - house (live Pa) – www.focalpoint.to, 
www.linenoiz.com

John's technique to live performance is different from many live PA's. It 
includes live recording and manipulation of sequences and does not involve 
a computer or master sequencer. Instead, he uses separate sequencers to 
control each instrument (sampler, synthesizer, drum machine) 
independently, which allows for a degree of live improvisation. Because he 
produces and remixes material live, every performance is a unique 
experience. Over the past 3 years John has played at some of the largest 
parties and clubs around Ohio.


-Kenya DuBois - portland, OR - downtempo/trip-hop – www.focalpoint.to, 
Adore Recordings, Minus Two Crew

Kenya DuBois constantly explores and shares the audible nature of his
existence. As a Producer and Sound Designer, Kenya nurtures the
elements of ambience and atmosphere in his compositions with a diverse
catalogue of tones, frequencies and exploited daydreamed sounds. A mood
provoking and unique mixture of ambient textures and minimal beats
compliments his cerebral style of composing. Often inspired by the
overture of silence, Kenya expresses musically his vision of artistic
storytelling. Founder of Adore Recordings and Distorted Grooves and half
of the epiphanic collaborative, Popularity Contest Committee, Kenya
DuBois is an Ambassador of the atmospheric state of mind.


-Frankie J. - chicago – DnB – www.focalpoint.to

Frankie J, is one of the Midwest’s fastest up and coming DJs / Producer.

Funky Buddha Lounge, where he canes the latest and greatest liquid funk 
Drum N’ Bass tunes as well as his original productions. Over the last 3 
years Frankie J has played at numerous clubs and events in almost every 
major city in the Midwest. Alongside djing, for the last two years Frankie 
J has been producing all styles of dance music including House, Drum N’ 
Bass, Hip-Hop, and Garage. Currently, you can hear some of Frankie J’s

-Digital Kate - cincy – DnB – www.focalpoint.to

years ago. Spawned from stardust and self-teachings, she found her groove 
in the rhythms of trip hop, drum and bass, and downtempo boom-bips. Her 
mission is one of true music passion, hoping to take those who listen on a 
mental journey. She picks her tracks carefully, making sure each one is 
significant, whether it be to an event, a person, or a moment. So open 
your mind, pay attention, and let her show you the door to the next level.


-Oompaloompa - trance - cincy - Airplane Clique/ GSP Entertainment

Joshua Perry aka Oompa Loompa, has been a recognized force in the Midwest 
for nearly 3 years now. The Epic/Anthem/Hard Trance style Oompa Loompa 
brings to the tables have provided the masses of the mid-west with lasting 
memories of an epic journey worthy of Willy Wonka himself.
Currently co-founder of up in coming Airplane Clique productions, and one 
of Trance's fastest rising stars, Joshua has begun working on his 3rd 
release "Gobstoppers" which will include his original track I'm your dj 
showcasing the dark epic sound we have come to know and recognize.
Playing out all over, Joshua has gathered great attention and helped to 
build a talented well rounded roster that AC is becoming vastly know for, 
and with a growing fan base, and a growing addiction, Joshua is now ready 
to move up and play out and tour the US and the world and let everyone 
hear the style that is Oompa Loompa.


-CatNap - triphop/ jazz - columbus - mechaproductions

Starting his dj career in 1996 with hiphop and IDM shows on WKCO 91.9fm,
Catnap held residencies from New York City to London UK in the late 90's,
and has made his mark on Ohio's rave and club scenes since moving to
Columbus in 2000. He is known for a style that is very eclectic but always
a mix of gritty breakbeats, retro sounds, and jazzy textures. His newest
DJ mix, "Rendez-Vous", mixes instrumental hiphop with jazz, lounge, and
world music in the same vein as Mark Farina's "Mushroom Jazz" series.
Original tracks by Catnap will also be featured on GrooveReactor Records'
upcoming compilation, to be released in January.


-Phrenzy - DnB -rokitlabs.com - djphrenzy.com / www.GrooveReactor.com

Steve Gillson exited the womb wearing a set of Sennheisers, but it wasn't 
until late 1996 that he discovered his alter ego, DJ Phrenzy. After 
quickly adapting his musical knowledge to the art of performance, he 
garnered several residencies in Southern Ohio and joined forces with 
Groove Reactor Records. Since then Phrenzy has been lurking in the shadows 
of the midwest, making rare public appearances alongside the likes of 
Dieselboy to Darude. Phrenzy steps to the decks with a unique blend of 
harmonic euphony and technical precision that always moves the crowd. 
Don't miss this opportunity to witness a musical purist in action.


- Robotnik - jungle/ragga - Steel Arm Records - Kokomo, IN

An old Jungle soldier in the Ragga trenches since late 94, Robotnik was 
brought up on a steady diet of beats from such old skoolers as UFO!, 3D, 
and R.A.W. this newly revitalized Ragga Mercenary turned DJ will step to 
the decks for his premier after giving up his dues and working it to the 
fullest to fuse the new rising Ragga sound with the old dark hard Jungle 
of yesteryear gone by. This soldier will kill heads and murder a 
soundsystem all while smoking a spliff he probably found in one of his 
nappy dreads. Ragga Not Dead!


-ADubzz - turntableism - cincy - www.basisproductions.com

With his superb scratching skillz mixed with the best ol' school and 
recent hip-hop and DnB tracks, Adam's calm demeanor is not to be mistaken 
for his skillz on the wheels of steel.

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

Cycle World International Motorcycle Show in Ohio

You are right, it is being held at the IX Center Jan. 30-Feb.1st. Adult
admission is $11, and child admission is $5. The shows hours are as
follows... friday 4pm-9pm, saturday 9am-9pm, and sunday 9:30am-5pm. If you
have any more questions, you can visit our website at
www.motorcycleshows.com

=========================================================================

I wanted to give the list a heads up on an event I and a number of other
people are through in April 23rd through 25th.  It's called Notacon and
the purpose is to explore technology, art, music and hopefully find some
synergy between them.  This is not party, not a rave nor is it a hacker
convetion, computer convetion or anything else of the sort.  However, it
may have elements of all of these and more.

We're currently seeking artists, performers and DJs who do unusual and
groundbreaking work to showcase their talent and art for our event.  We're
also inviting interested parties to attend the event.

For more information, including our call for proposals, please check out
our webpage:

http://www.notacon.org/

That's actually pretty hot...

With a little filter action and some work on the rhythm section, that could be a pretty amazing
track. Keep working on it, AI.

Peace,

Here is a little sample of what one might expect of the energy that Kri is

capable of manifesting while on the decks. The video is from a 2000 bridge

party in NY the first time I ever heard Kri play. Will definitely be
heading out to

the Omnitribe party on Friday.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr - tribe.net

I had this wacked out idea to make some sort of friendster-like standard
along the lines of XML data interchange tied together with an app that
worked like gnutella, with the addition of having a rendezvous enabled
component. The Rendezvous enabled part lets people on your subnet with a
program that speaks this protocol I had a dream of talk to each other. So it
would focus more on physical proximity than anything. You'd meet your
neighbors friends and such too.

The possibilities are really endless. Once you have the little xml files of
all your friends, you could make say, a plugin that generates a dynamic
website that would be like a community blog, just use it for community file
sharing, chat, wtf ever.

So like, I'm only kinda geek enough to do it, so someone else really should.
I'll share your millions.

- Mike

So I bought the domain www.thehotshit.com with this vision in mind...

There will be a place for registered deejays to post charts.

There will be a place for registered producers to post samples and =
review their own music.

There will be a place for reviews of up and coming hot shit that are =
done by selected deejays, producers, record store owners

There will be a forum to discuss all of the above.

And of course, webmail (pop and imap will both be supported).

What I'm writing about is to gauge interest and select people interested =
in writing reviews in different genres as well as to pass the word on to =
other persons around the world that may be interested in becoming part =
of the hot shit community.  It's all free to use and access.  So hit me =
back if you're interested in writing about up and coming tracks and/or =
events.  I'd really like to reach out to at least other regions of =
america (particularly the detroit/chicago/san fran producers).

damn skippy.  techno on friday, house on saturday, and
a little bit of everything on sunday:)

For the alcoholics amoung us keep in mind that Abbasso
is doing a small (read unofficial) pre and post thing
for derrick carter starting at 8pm-ish.  tall pauls
are really cost effective:)

Subject: {pb-cle} Plate Techtonics Final Warning

Y'all know the deal about this by now, I'm sure, so
this is just a little final reminder.

Abbasso tonight...

Andy James 
Boompsie
Meghan
Damon Havill

9pm - 2:30 am (at least) - 21+ - $5

Hope to see lots of y'all out this evening...should be
a great night for techno in Cleveland.

Oh yeah, and if you don't show up the techno police
will be visiting you sometime between four and 6am
tomorrow, juiced up on tall pauls, for the sole
purpose of pissing on your doorstep (or so alex tells
me anyway).

Peace,
Jamie

Subject: {pb-cle}  "Come Together"--Sat in Kent 

I urge everyone to please attend this event.  I know there is a lot of 
things going on this weekend but this is for a very good cause.  Whether or 
not you know Kevin, you can still come out to show your support for someone 
who has supported our scene for a long time.    $5 is not a lot of money to 
pay to listen to these artists and to help someone who is in need.

So I bought the domain www.thehotshit.com with this vision in mind...

There will be a place for registered deejays to post charts.

There will be a place for registered producers to post samples and review their own music.

There will be a place for reviews of up and coming hot shit that are done by selected deejays,
producers, record store owners

There will be a forum to discuss all of the above.

And of course, webmail (pop and imap will both be supported).

What I'm writing about is to gauge interest and select people interested in writing reviews in
different genres as well as to pass the word on to other persons around the world that may be
interested in becoming part of the hot shit community.  It's all free to use and access.  So hit me
back if you're interested in writing about up and coming tracks and/or events.  I'd really like to
reach out to at least other regions of america (particularly the detroit/chicago/san fran
producers).

Subject: {pb-cle} Tsuyoshi Suzuki interview

interview by Ari D



When you think of who is who in the Japanese dance music scene, one of the
names that immediately come to mind is… Tsuyoshi Suzuki.  He is one of the
elite Japanese DJ’s who truly made it on the international DJ circuit. 
Having played to millions of party people all over the globe, he is
touching down in NYC for yet another appearance.  Classic names like
Matsuri, Return to the Source and Prana – to many they are synonymous with
Trance, and they are also synonymous with his name.  In 1993, Tsuyoshi
moved to London, where his DJ career took off when he became a resident DJ
at Return to the Source.  The list of his subsequent adventures is long
and enviable, and reads like “what’s happening” on the planet.  Nowadays,
he enjoys worldwide acceptance of his duality of sound.  And that allows
him to explore his roots in both the electro and new wave of the 80’s as
well as in the heydays of the psytrance movement of the early 90’s.  Japan
loves him, the world party massive loves him and on January 24th, you are
going to get a chance to get to know him better too.  Here is what
Tsuyoshi had to say.



Where are you now?  How did you spend your New Years?



I'm in Tokyo at my studio/label (FEEDBACK RECORDINGS, MAD SKIPPERS)
office.  For New Years, I was in Hamburg, Germany at Phondrome.



You have played in many places in the world in the last decade.  Have
there been any memorable performances you just can’t forget?



Basically almost all the events where I have been playing were great. But
Return to the Source in Japan at Mt. Fuji in '98 was awesome!!!!!



Tell us about the trance parties and open air events in your home country.



It's totally well organized and they have great sound systems.  The people
are really good audience and atmosphere of the events is amazing.



Over the years how do you think the global dance movement has changed and
where would you say it is going in the future?



Three or four years ago, I thought about the dance music scene "what's
going on" – it's nothing new and nothing underground anymore.  But in last
couple years, I think there are some nice new things going on in this
scene.  At the moment, as far as the elektro scene, NY and Berlin are
great. As far as the trance scene, I don't know.....trance is everywhere
in the world now so.....



As Joujouka you make and perform very eclectic music. Where do you draw
your inspiration? Do your influences lay in several different genres, ones
other than trance?



Yes JOUJOUKA has got many inspirations in it.  Mostly '80s elektro stuff
and alternative rock stuff which is nothing to do with trance music. My
music background is strongly in the '80s elektric music and new wave
sound.  But when I play or produce as DJ TSUYOSHI, the style will be mix
of trance, techno and psytrance.



What kind of philosophy do you follow in life?  Do you think your success
as an artist is a result of following these principles?



I follow the healthy life at the moment.  If you are sick, you can't do
anything.  I'm not doing music just for the money things so....and I have
got so many things, yet I still want to do music.



As a veteran DJ, you’ve inspired many to DJ too.  What advice can you
offer them?



I think the young DJ's have to listen more to different kind of music and
get the many different kinds of music.  And try to express your
originality as much as you can.



What is the first record you ever bought?  And how big would you say your
collection is today?



I think when I was 8 or 9 years old, I bought Bay City Rollers stuff.  I
never calculated how many I have now so I don't know........but there is a
lot....!



Tell us about Feedback Records.  Who is part of the crew and what are your
plans for the label?



Yes this is still small label so we just near signing the contract with
Intergroove.  The artists are myself and Mitsumoto at the moment.  From
Feb., we will release the vinyl for every month so please watch out!!!!! 
I have also elktro label called Mad Skippers which is also signed to
Intergroove.   This is mainly JOUJOUKA stuff and will release new single
next month with Northern Lite and Thomas P. Heckmann remix.



Who are your favorite artists and tracks to play out right now?



Right now, if I play as DJTSUYOSHI (trance), new artist called ESKIMO,
MITSUMOTO are very good.  If I play as NUMANOID ( this is my elektro DJ
name ), PEACHES, NORTHERN LITE, DJ HELL.



Can you suggest any fresh artists who are breaking new musical ground,
someone new we should watch for?



MITSUMOTO ( techno-psytrance ), JOUJOUKA ( elektro-rock ), BOY FROM BRAZIL
( elektro ), ESKIMO ( psytrance )



You are returning for yet another appearance here in New York.  What do
you think of the City and the parties here?  Any memories from your
previous stays in New York you can share with us?



NY is my all time favorite city in the world and I was always willing to
go there.  Coz' the elektro scene in NY is the greatest in the world. 
About the trance scene, I feel it's great also but it needs to be a little
bit more open minded about the music. The first gig in NY as Return to the
Source was one of my most memorable events ever.



What’s in store for us when you come to play?



When I play as DJ TSUYOSHI will be trance-techno-psytrance style. And this
time is DJ TSUYOSHI, so pretty much a mix between psytrance and other
trance stuff.

Hope to see lots of y'all out this evening...should be
a great night for techno in Cleveland.

Oh yeah, and if you don't show up the techno police
will be visiting you sometime between four and 6am
tomorrow, juiced up on tall pauls, for the sole
purpose of pissing on your doorstep (or so alex tells

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} derrick carter roll call

well, there is the hyatt by the convention center which is ~8 
blocks away, and it's nice, there is a courtyard mariott on Gay  
(or Spring, or Long) which is RIGHT there near the club... maybe 
it's on broad street... it's been a while, but the courtyard is 
the nicest when looking at proximity, plus you can get rooms with 
hot tubs.  :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} wmc 

If I am still in S. Florida in early March I may try
to hit some wmc stuff. Last year, I was enjoying the
Keys so much I just stayed down there... blowing off
the wmc and a chance to catch some baseball spring
training and rotting on the beach instead. 

Not to metion the costly admission to wmc events...
what are some of the more affordable things to go
check out this year???

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Plate Techtonics Final Warning

I'm definately going to be there, going to be a little late since I'm not 
going to get home till 9:00 and didn't want to leave camera in freezing car 
and don't know if the company would freak out over a camera, even though it's 
not like we do anything super secret here.  Anywho I'll be up there 
eventually.

p.s. Andy and Matt, save me a CD :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Plate Tectonics Review

All in all a fun night and a good first effort, IMHO. 
Great music from all involved...Damon, Meghan, and
Boompsie all played great sets, and Andy flat tore the
roof off!  Killer techno...if you don't have a copy of
his new mix track him down and get one...enough said.

Thanks to all who came out...it's nice to see a head
crowd gettin' a good swerve on and dancing their asses
off until 3am...hope y'all enjoyed it as much as I
did.  

Particular Thanks to Valerie, Jenny and Alex
Forte...Without the time you guys put in this wouldn't
have been nearly what it was.

Paul...LEARN TO REGULATE:P  enough said.


Enough about things past, on to things future:

Plate Tectonics #2 - Feb 20
Product 19 (HOS, Electrasoul, labtypezero.com)
Colin Pierce (HOS, Electrasoul, Zeroclothing.com)
DVS (Electrasoul, Koala-Tea.com)
Jamie Tyler (Abbasso)

This promises to be a thumping night...most of y'all
know colin and john (prod. 19) but for those who don't
these guys can throw down like nobody's business.  be
prepared for a night of banging techno and sick DJ
skills.

Plate Tectonics #3 - March 5
Jeff Samuel 
Mike Salamon
Derek Johnson
Damon Havill

This is going to be insane...Jeff is one of my
favorite minimal tech producers right now, and from
what I've heard he will absolutely tear Abbasso apart.
 More info come shortly...keep eyes open for the
flyer.

Alright, off to work with me...only about 3 hours
later than I planned...oops.

-Jamie

Seriously, thanks to all who came out last night... it was really good to see 
everybody keeping the dancefloor alive so well on a Friday.  Great sets... 
agreed, Andy killed it.  Quality.... Good to see and meet some new faces.  
Thanks to Jamie, Val, Jen, Alex, NAPS, of course the DJs and everybody who came out 
to support.  We'll have to do this again.... oh, say in another month!

Thank you everyone who came out!  The music was definitely high energy.  It was so nice getting the chance to actually talk to so many of you (And very sorry to anyone I did not meet)  A special thanks from me to Aaron, Moke and Meghan for tearing up the floor quite frequently... and Luke for the drink, and Jamie for the tall pauls, and Boompsie for the great conversation, and Jen for sharing hostessing duties with me (and being a great friend), to Alex for his fantastic flyering skills, and Miss Candice for being the first one in the door.  
 
And thank you Jamie and Damon and Napoleon for just beign true heads with a good vibe and as you so often like to say Jamie..no b.s. 

Jamie Tyler <jhtyler@sbcglobal.net> wrote:
All in all a fun night and a good first effort, IMHO. 
Great music from all involved...Damon, Meghan, and
Boompsie all played great sets, and Andy flat tore the
roof off! Killer techno...if you don't have a copy of
his new mix track him down and get one...enough said.

Thanks to all who came out...it's nice to see a head
crowd gettin' a good swerve on and dancing their asses
off until 3am...hope y'all enjoyed it as much as I
did. 

Particular Thanks to Valerie, Jenny and Alex
Forte...Without the time you guys put in this wouldn't
have been nearly what it was.

Paul...LEARN TO REGULATE:P enough said.


Enough about things past, on to things future:

Plate Tectonics #2 - Feb 20
Product 19 (HOS, Electrasoul, labtypezero.com)
Colin Pierce (HOS, Electrasoul, Zeroclothing.com)
DVS (Electrasoul, Koala-Tea.com)
Jamie Tyler (Abbasso)

This promises to be a thumping night...most of y'all
know colin and john (prod. 19) but for those who don't
these guys can throw down like nobody's business. be
prepared for a night of banging techno and sick DJ
skills.

Plate Tectonics #3 - March 5
Jeff Samuel 
Mike Salamon
Derek Johnson
Damon Havill

This is going to be insane...Jeff is one of my
favorite minimal tech producers right now, and from
what I've heard he will absolutely tear Abbasso apart.
More info come shortly...keep eyes open for the
flyer.

Alright, off to work with me...only about 3 hours
later than I planned...oops.

-Jamie

about to go get everything set up and whatnot. i expect to see
everyone who is into good music out at the shadow lounge tonight.

TONIGHT January 17th, 10pm-3am The Shadow Lounge in East Liberty
(Pittsburgh).

Titonton doing a LIVE PA along side his drummer, Don Carlos,
playing LIVE - This is a rare and unique experience that you'd be
hard pressed to find happening anywhere else except Titonton's
Studio.

et al bringing it to you crazy and LIVE for the moment.

The night will be opened and closed by the party rocker, Jim

We were gonna go, but it's just way nasty out and the
roads around here suck... they don't wanna pay the
plow guys OT on a Sat... another shining example of
our civic leaders placing $$$ over human safety.

$5 for all this is totally off the hook, have fun and
be freakin' careful out there in this mess.

Holy Bitch-Monkey!!! Great night guys, glad to see all the support for the techno in Cleveland!! Big Ups to Jamie, Val, Dammon and Jenn and all the DJs!! Andy James tore it up for sure, WOW!!! Can't wait for the next one!! Thanks to all who made it out, fun, fun night!

It was so nice getting the chance to actually talk to so many of you (And very sorry to anyone I did not meet) A special thanks from me to Aaron, Moke and Meghan for tearing up the floor quite frequently... and Luke for the drink, and Jamie for the tall pauls, and Boompsie for the great conversation, and Jen for sharing hostessing duties with me (and being a great friend), to Alex for his fantastic flyering skills, and Miss Candice for being the first one in the door. 

And thank you Jamie and Damon and Napoleon for just beign true heads with a good vibe and as you so often like to say Jamie..no b.s.

Great music from all involved...Damon, Meghan, and

Thanks to all who came out...it's nice to see a head
crowd gettin' a good swerve on and dancing their asses
off until 3am...hope y'all enjoyed it as much as I
did. 

Particular Thanks to Valerie, Jenny and Alex
Forte...Without the time you guys put in this wouldn't
have been nearly what it was.

Paul...LEARN TO REGULATE:P enough said.


Enough about things past, on to things future:

Plate Tectonics #2 - Feb 20
Product 19 (HOS, Electrasoul, labtypezero.com)
Colin Pierce (HOS, Electrasoul, Zeroclothing.com)
DVS (Electrasoul, Koala-Tea.com)
Jamie Tyler (Abbasso)

This promises to be a thumping night...most of y'all
know colin and john (prod. 19) but for those who don't
these guys can throw down like nobody's business. be
prepared for a night of banging techno and sick DJ
skills.

Plate Tectonics #3 - March 5
Jeff Samuel 
Mike Salamon
Derek Johnson
Damon Havill

This is going to be insane...Jeff is one of my
favorite minimal tech producers right now, and from
what I've heard he will absolutely tear Abbasso apart.
More info come shortly...keep eyes open for the
flyer.

Alright, off to work with me...only about 3 hours
later than I planned...oops.

-Jamie

I want to first off thank [mark] for providing some extra sound for =
titonton.  The shit was off the chain, just HOT.  Sad that alot of =
people missed it.  The people that didn't sleep, I thank you from the =
bottom of my heart for coming out.  The dnb heads Jea and Adam Bomb were =
in the house, much love for that, we also had Alan, Cris B, Cara, Frank =
(and the beer run to boot), Celeste, Polarbear, Paul, Default Kelly D =
aka Diddy, and of course the entire technoir crew, who represented =
themselves nicely. =20

Here's what you missed:

Titonton and Don completely killed shit.  I had to go outside for a =
minute cause i was about to spontaneously combust cause it was so hot. =20

Technoir played some solid shit to follow up titonton, which is a task =
that is not easy to do.

All night long jesse heady provided some outstanding visuals.

We hope to follow up sometime in late spring with another hot event, =
which we will keep you posted on.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Saturday Night Live Hot Shit thanks...

I showed up late, and was only able to catch the last number Titonton and 
Don were playing. I am pretty salty I missed out on the red meat and was 
only able to eat the last of the mashed potatoes.

What the hell did I just say?

I was tired as balls, and balls can get pretty tired sometimes.

I had a great time though. Technoir has yet to disappoint me. The Shadow 
Lounge is such a nice place to chill, listen to great tunes, and act wacky.

Thanks much to Hot Shit and Technoir.

I hope in the future someday I will get another shot at catching Titonton 
live with his drummer...

It was indeed hot shit last night.  Titonton killed it and his drummer 
was tight as hell.  You guys definately need to reschedual them for 
another Pittsburgh appearance.  Technoir was on point as well.  I didn't 
even realise that I knew the one Luke from back in the day... hit me up dog.

Yah I havent given a proper review yet, but this was one of those events I
was looking forward to for a real good minute...so here it comes.

...We got there and Meghan was droppping the sickest shit I'd heard (since
my car earlier that day) ;-), but I was way impressed by her techno stylee
no less. Way propa. Glad you had fun. Sherry also tore it up, and was really
feeling it when she did a non-hard-techno session in there. Really spruced
it up. Andy James came on and played some crappy trance anthems from 98, and
I wasn?t too happy about that.....muhahaa....jk....that mofo tore the roof
straight off with his hard techno 3+ input source-layering! He's good. Maybe
too good? Lindsey, you check and see if he's battery powered yet?

Thanks again for putting on such a fun night to Damon and Jamie and their
two lovely lady friends, as well as Naps and everyone else that made it soo
much fun. Holla to everyone that was out anyone I met! Can't wait till the
next one...so I'll have to feed on some Third Eye techno next week 8 D

Ez,

alex

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Plate Tectonics Review

Yeah, it was great, 'nuff said.

In more detail, thanks Valerie for the glowstick straw :) and thanks 
napolean for being the coolest club owner/manger I know, well, the 
only club owner/manager that I know, but even if I knew others, he 
would be the best.  Also thanks to the bartender lady (Has some name 
that doesn't get heard well in a "club atmosphere" (ie music 
thumping), Demasia, maybe?  know it began with a D) for the tiny 
conversation we had, even though it was probably the longest 
conversation I had all night, darn anti-socializing.

I'll get the pictures up sometime in the next couple days.

In other news, sorry I missed derick carter last night, I was still 
tired after coming back from peter trapp show that afternoon 
(computer for $10, woohoo) that I fell asleep and didn't even wake up 
till 9:00, said screw this and slept till midnight :)  At least now I 
have plenty of sleep to check out 10hrs 10 djs later tonight even 
though I'll probably only get like 2 hours of sleep overnight before 
I have to go to work.

And in some sad news, I'm still having issues with the ear infection, 
even though it's not infected it's still stuffy sounding, so I'm 
taking some meds that have in big bold letters don't drink, so plate 
tectonics was my going away party for not drinking the next month, oh 
well, not like I'm a raging alcoholic anyway, yet...

...We got there and Meghan was droppping the sickest shit I'd heard (since
my car earlier that day) ;-), but I was way impressed by her techno stylee
no less. Way propa. Glad you had fun. Sherry also tore it up, and was really
feeling it when she did a non-hard-techno session in there. Really spruced
it up. Andy James came on and played some crappy trance anthems from 98, and
I wasn?t too happy about that.....muhahaa....jk....that mofo tore the roof
straight off with his hard techno 3+ input source-layering! He's good. Maybe
too good? Lindsey, you check and see if he's battery powered yet?

Thanks again for putting on such a fun night to Damon and Jamie and their
two lovely lady friends, as well as Naps and everyone else that made it soo
much fun. Holla to everyone that was out anyone I met! Can't wait till the
next one...so I'll have to feed on some Third Eye techno next week 8 D

Ez,

I want to first off thank [mark] for providing some extra sound for
titonton.  The shit was off the chain, just HOT.  Sad that alot of people
missed it.  The people that didn't sleep, I thank you from the bottom of my
heart for coming out.  The dnb heads Jea and Adam Bomb were in the house,
much love for that, we also had Alan, Cris B, Cara, Frank (and the beer run
to boot), Celeste, Polarbear, Paul, Default Kelly D aka Diddy, and of course
the entire technoir crew, who represented themselves nicely.

Here's what you missed:

Titonton and Don completely killed shit.  I had to go outside for a minute
cause i was about to spontaneously combust cause it was so hot.

Technoir played some solid shit to follow up titonton, which is a task that
is not easy to do.

All night long jesse heady provided some outstanding visuals.

We hope to follow up sometime in late spring with another hot event, which
we will keep you posted on.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday Night Live Hot Shit thanks...

hey hey...i certainly don't feel i should be on the top of the list of thanks...but i appreciate it.
i'm down for the cause.

indeed, it was H.O.T.T. in that piece, figuratively and literally. tito just wrecked the place up,
down and sideways, and don just got ill on the skins.

the technoir crew, as USUAL, were fantastically fine and spectacularly well. i've now seen them a
handful of times, and it gets so easy to take the talent of that crew for granted because it always
sounds amazing, but what they do with the live + records thing takes way more skill than they let
on...like hall of fame sports figures, they almost make it look too easy.

and the people....oh, the ones who know were there. those who appreciate the funk were certainly in
the house and those who missed, due to weather or general laziness...well, i do so feel bad for ya.

and of course, jim selecta warmed everybody up with his trademark hip hop.

oh, and jea has crunchy corn poo.

Polarbear, Paul, Default Kelly D aka Diddy, and of course the

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


So Friday I went to plate tectonics which was a blast.  I was planning on swinging by Wish for Luke Solomon as well, but go figure-  I didn’t make it because I got too drunk.  Definitely great to hear a full night of techno.  Damon’s set was a perfect way to start the evening off.  Both Meagan and Boompsie rocked it out.  And damn did Andy James tear it up.  Thanks Jamie and Damon for starting this great monthly.  This is going to be a great night, and I’m especially psyched for the jeff Samuel night!!

 

Saturday, I started the evening at Abbasso, and then headed over to Moda for DC.  Unfortunately I missed misterbradleyp’s set which I wanted to see.  I did see Doug play an awesome set though.  I was really digging what I remember of DC’s set, but of towards the end I got really drunk again and don’t remember the rest of it.  From what I hear, it’s probably a good thing because I heard it was getting more towards the cheesy side.  Afterwards I headed over to Abbasso and came in to Jamie and Brant playing some really good records ;)  

 

I was planning on heading to Twist early yesterday, but when I woke up, I knew that wasn’t going to happen.  I was tired, worn out, and just plain old brain dead from the weekend.  I did make it down there around 7:15 though, but missed Reese’s set that I’m sure rocked.  I got even more tired when I got there, so basically sat in a chair in the corner for the majority of the time I was there avoiding having to get up.  Got to hear the energetic Cloud 10 jam out, heard really good sets from both Briri and misterbradleyp, heard Thomar bring up the energy level a bit (and saw a few hops from him).  I left during mike filly’s set, but I was really enjoying what he was playing.  Sorry, Trout, I missed your set.  But there was no way I could last any longer and make it into work this morning.  I was definitely hurting!!  Thanks Doug, though, for putting this together again and making this such a great monthly Sunday!!

 

Anyways, though, this was a really great weekend! But now it’s Monday and I’m back at work :(

Meghan, I couldn't tell if you were drunk or high on techno.  I also had a great time at this event.  I'm so happy to hear more techno in Cleveland!!!!  

Don't miss the Electrasoul crew in February and Jeff Samuel in March. Colin Pierce will be moving to Chicago soon, so come and hear his last set in Ohio before he moves!!!

I disagree about the cost of parties at WMC.  On one level there a
million big parties that cost a million dollars, but definitely looking
back at it I would say that I had more fun at the down-low parties that
you just walked off the street into then the ones people paid @.

Subject: {pb-cle} Kent : weekend review

Hey All,

A huge thank you to everyone who came to the Kevin Hyatt Benefit at the 
Robin Hood this past Sat. The event  went very well and was a lot of fun. 
Most importantly,  we raised over $1000 for Kevin's medical expenses. Thanks 
again to everyone that made this possible!

Massive Respect,
Evan Evolution

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

There's more than enough time to organize a massive pb-cle migration w/ several soundsystems and our own community at Teknival this year.  So who's down or interested? This is going to be an amazing time... ;)


Calling all Soundsystems! 

The Toronto Freetekno community will be collaborating once again to generate a 2004 teknival. From July 16 to 18 a quiet patch of Ontario crown land will become a temporary musical playground for anyone and everyone with ears. The event will of course be 100% free. People can show up as early as they'd like (some crews may be showing up as early as july 9) and stay as long as they'd like, until the last partier hits the ground. 

ANY and ALL Soundsystems are invited to come set up camp and Jam along side the bizarre collection of deranged Torontonians that has come to be known as freeteknotoronto. Even if you've never thrown a jam before, feel free to get a crew together and set up a stage. You've got the knowlege of some seasoned veterans to draw from. Last year we were lucky to be joined by collectives from across Ontario, from Quebec and from New York. This year promises to be bigger, harder, ect. ect. 

A release of pre-flyers will be circulating in Toronto by mid March. 
We would like an idea of how many stages will be represented this year, so if you plan on coming and would like to be included please contact us with a YES/NO/MAYBE by the first week in March. More informative flyers should hit the street by June 1. If you would like a write-up to appear in these flyers, please let us know. 

Also feel free to design your own teknival flyer or web graphic to 
send around to your crew/city/whatever. There's already 3 collectives in toronto working on separate designs, reps from other cities are ideal. 
Teknival is a decentralized non-hierarchical event meaning no one person or system plans it. It also means that if someone doesn't make it happen, it won't. Take it into your own hands and make this event the event you want it to be. 

Teknival Sound System Email List: 
If you'd like to be in the loop on the planning process and have your 
say or whatever just email this address and recieve all the communique's between systems.

Subject: {pb-cle} derrick carter review

--0-774034837-1074548342=:84906
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

i cant even begin to describe how inc readable derrick carter was. i had been waiting 4 years to see him, so the long wait sure did pay off.. i got there around 11:30 with steph and andy, and got to catch part of dougs set, which was a good warm up... pretty much everyone that was at platetectonics friday showed up... good seeing jenny, damon, valerie, jamie,napoleon,alex, and also andre, damion, skillz, jason,natalie, chad, kristin, casey, wayne, and everyone else i forgot..
 
 by 12:30 ish derrick came on, by then i was pretty much on my way to being obliviated. as soon as derrick went on the crowd went nuts... the break circle was awesome, with damion showing off his new moves... but then the most disturbing thing ive ever seen in the past 5 years of going to events happened.. 2 or 3 of modas meathead security guys rushed into the break circle and grabbed skillz by his shirt and literally threw him out of the club, in a very forceful manner. considering how drunk i was and full of rage and ran up to one of the security gards, pushed him and was like"what the fuck, that was my friend you just kicked out!!" he was like bitch do you want to get kicked out of the club too" obviously i was pretty pissed off, but i wasn't going to let some prick security ruin a night of derrick carter, so i quickly forgot about it.... 
soon after i ran into doug, and he gave andy and i a vip wrist band, thanks doug your the shit!! andy and i went up stairs and rocked out some more vip style, along with the abbasso crew, trout, alex,ray and some other heads. i literally dance derricks entire set, except for when i was going to get a drink. his mixes were flawless, funky, and he even played a few tracks i own my self.. towards the end he started playing some of his more chill tracks to end off the night. 
near the end i managed to sneak my way into the dj booth with stephanie and get some awesome pictures of derreck. we even got to chat with him a bit and let him now how inc readably awesome he was, trying not to look like to much of a drunken obsessive fan. derrick is just as i expected him to be, really down to earth and willing to talk to anyone, he didn't have im better then you attitude that alot of djs have. steph mentioned to him that she was going to see him tomorrow, and derrick was said" oh yeah im playing in cleveland tomorrow" umm, no derrick columbus,lol...we also got to let him know about bassline, and let him know that we are now going to be doing a write up on the derrick carter ritual events with pictures, so keep on the look out for that. 
 
pretty much i didn't want the night to end.. considering that i haven't heard that much good house in one night in years, and i danced so much that i felt like i ran a marathon the next day....i haven't had this much fun in a long time... but one thing i will tell you is that this was my first time at moda and prob ally my last, the only reason i went to moda was to see derrick. this is for the simple fact of what happen to sillz getting kicked out for the club. the whole theme  behind the club is supposed to be ''all about the music" but obviously that is a big fucking lie. the whole theme of moda is'" all about the money" well at least thats what i noticed. 
overall it was in inc readable night, it truly is a shame to the ppl who missed derrick carter,  a true house legend..
 
p.s hope you had an awesome birthday steph...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} derrick carter review

Regarding Skillz getting tossed out, Mike from
Mythodic posted on another board that he needs to get
in touch with him to make amends for the bouncers'
actions.  So, if Skillz is on this board email mike at
michael@mythodic.com.  If he isn't could someone
please forward this to him if it hasn't been already.

It's my personal opinion that Mythodic and Jessica are
trying to do well by this city, bringing in big acts
of varying genres and trying to kick-start a
larger-scale scene in cleveland, and I applaud them
for it.  I only wish there was somewhere other than
Moda that would be really viable for them to do it. 
I've been there for at least a half dozen shows, and
only left once satisfied with my experience at that
club.  The staff is arrogant and intolerant
(obviously), the drinks are way overpriced, the vibe
is never friendly, and unfortunately most of the DJ's
that I have heard there have played less-than
exemplary sets.  I'm not sure why this seems to
happen...but it unfortunately does.  Here's hoping
things change there with Mythodic's influence, but I
really don't see it happening anytime soon.

sorry if im my email i came off as if i was disrespecting mythodic in any sort of way. i have always supported mythodic events and will continue to do so. i know mythodic had nothing to do with modas behavior. i really do hope mythodic can change the outlook of the club. thanks again mike for everything, and keep up the good work....

Regarding Skillz getting tossed out, Mike from
Mythodic posted on another board that he needs to get
in touch with him to make amends for the bouncers'
actions. So, if Skillz is on this board email mike at
michael@mythodic.com. If he isn't could someone
please forward this to him if it hasn't been already.

It's my personal opinion that Mythodic and Jessica are
trying to do well by this city, bringing in big acts
of varying genres and trying to kick-start a
larger-scale scene in cleveland, and I applaud them
for it. I only wish there was somewhere other than
Moda that would be really viable for them to do it. 
I've been there for at least a half dozen shows, and
only left once satisfied with my experience at that
club. The staff is arrogant and intolerant
(obviously), the drinks are way overpriced, the vibe
is never friendly, and unfortunately most of the DJ's
that I have heard there have played less-than
exemplary sets. I'm not sure why this seems to
happen...but it unfortunately does. Here's hoping
things change there with Mythodic's influence, but I
really don't see it happening anytime soon.

i migrated to drinking later in the night. that way when the bars close, i
wont be raging drunk... just raging semi drunk. ;)

When that place first came around that was my EXACT thoughts of it period.
I've never set foot in the place, and probably wont. Unless someone dragged
me out there. I saw your pictures Lindsey, and sorry I couldnt make it out.
I really wanted to for Stephs Bday, but Im going through "after holidays"
effects. hehe..

Subject: RE: Re: {pb-cle} derrick carter review

I can't really comment on the incident involving Skillz because I did not see it first-hand. I have heard several first-hand accounts, and I hope that both sides can forgive, forget, and move on. But it has me thinking of some larger questions.

I've noticed an increase in this kind of stuff overall in the past two years in all clubs across the country. It's not just Moda that seems to wield a heavy hand. I have witnessed similar incidents clubs in DC, Boston, New York City, Chicago and Miami, and have even been involved in them...They are not fun, and not something anyone wants. But it is, unfortunately, a price I think we have to pay to further our scene. Examples:

Last year at the Conference, David was asked to leave a party simply for bending over to get a lighter out of his lower pocket and lighting someone else's cigarette. The bouncer *thought* there was contraband involved, and there was no "due process" for Dave to prove himself otherwise. The fact that David had nothing on him but a lighter and a pack of cigarettes didn't matter at that point. The bouncer caught something out of the corner of his eye and it was his word against David's. It's a private establishment, and you are there on their terms. They reserve the right to oust you if they for whatever reason feel you are breaking their rules.

I've also seen friends have to leave Vinyl (ARC), and ARC probably one of the THE most friendly scenes in New York City. It's a CYA for the clubs to stay in business.

I don't envy the position of clubs who are forced to play the middleman between law enforcement and party-goers, all the while maintaining the reputation of their club as appealing to both sides. Especially in today's hostile legal environment, and especially here in Cleveland where stories of fights, shootings, and even deaths in the Flats in recent years have caused officials to scrutinize security practices and have caused bouncers to throw around heavy hands. I remember many fights breaking out along W6th St. as I was flyering last Summer for the Summer Series. I'm sure the last thing Moda wants is that kind of crowd moving in. Do I agree with what they did in Skillz' case? No, because I know our community wouldn't intentionally try to rile up a club. but, can I understand why clubs have tough policies? Yes, I can see it. Sure the bouncer in particular may have been a royal jerk but is it reason to hate the whole institution?

So, I guess what I'm saying is that like any good relationship, there is compromise and there has to be some understanding on behalf of both parties for the relationship to grow. Club owners and their individual employees need to see and understand that most "ravers" coming above-ground to dance and celebrate good music are generally going to be respectful of the ground rules they have to have to stay in business, and party-goers in turn need to realize that there are some things they need to sacrifice in order to continue to see talent brought to their cities. I guess in the spirit of MLK day today I'm thinking that the strongest form of protest is understanding.

We can bitch about drink prices, doorp policies and so forth, but as someone said to me on Saturday night, "No place is perfect and we all can't have everything we want all the time." The utopia we all strive for is as ethereal as the ways we try to describe our joy in the music, and it is something we all have to work at. It does not get handed to us. Like any love affair, we have to be willing to forgive and move on if it is to last.

Subject: RE: Re: {pb-cle} derrick carter review

Basically, clubs totally blow. Period. The worst of
them should be boycotted. If I was throwing an event
and an incident like that occurred, (barring a
complete apology and $ refund to the 'victim') I would
be moving to another venue, without hesitation. I dont
even care how much smaller it would be or if I'd have
to settle for less sound... or completely cancel it
altogether. 

Keep going, keep spending your precious loot and it
will only get worse. People who treat others this way
will not be receiving my patronage, and you shouldn't
offer yours either.

It's a simple matter of standing up for what you
believe in... even if it means suffering on your part.
This is the only way to combat oppression, be it an
overzealous bouncer or abusive government. Those who
allow themselvs to be abused are nearly as guilty as
the abusers themselves.

Oh and btw... they are NOT that nice at Arc in NYC. I
was very close to leaving that place a mere 10 seconds
after I arrived.

When that place first came around that was my EXACT thoughts of it period.
I've never set foot in the place, and probably wont. Unless someone dragged
me out there. I saw your pictures Lindsey, and sorry I couldnt make it out.
I really wanted to for Stephs Bday, but Im going through "after holidays"

I've never set foot in the place, and probably wont. Unless someone dragged

omg I have this almost obsessive pet peeve about
this... I argued w/ someone for HOURS about the fact
that it is NOT 's-h-e-r-b-e-R-T'... it's s-h-e-r-b-e-t

It's a French word, so phonetically it's something
like sherr-BAY

Man, I've got this real high and mighty, pretentious
thing goin on... somebody stop me!!!

Of course I would never advocate a boycott w/out
thinking it through... I do see some of your points,
but realize you are talking to a 'hard-liner' here.
Heres how I see it: Deep down I couldnt give 2 shits
about moda. That place could go up in flames for all I
care, they attacked a friend of mine. End of story. 

Are we so hard up that we HAVE to go to places like
that and sell ourselves out, get pushed around, and
fatten the pockets of assholes??? I love music as much
as anyone, and I like to hear it in a nice setting
with phatty sound, but I will NEVER watch someone get
abused (esp. physically) and sit by and stand for it.
My life has taught me that pacifism DOES NOT WORK!!!
Even the most beautiful 'siren-song' is not worth
hearing to me under those conditions.

I have been to Abasso exactly 4 times... I paid to get
in 2 of those times, so I def. DO NOT feel like a
freeloader if that is your implication. I have given
more than my share of $$$ and effort to the scene as
long as I've been a part of it. I have stayd after to
clean venues many times just to contribute positively.

Subject: {pb-cle} Breakdancing, Moda, etc.

First of all... it is crazy how this list always turns things into such
drama/hypocracy.  Get over it. It was most definately WRONG how the bouncer
handled it, but Moda is a fairly new club and have no previous history of
not fixing things that are broken.  If you want to take issue... do it with
something other than an isolated incident and do things that effect a
greater change for all of us.  If you want your warehouse and underground
parties back.... fight the government... not (ultimately) the promoters who
are trying to keep our world alive.

Regarding the incident @ Moda with Skillz and whoever else... it was
ABSOLUTELY and POSITVELY wrong how the bouncers handled the situation.  Moda
is a dope spot, and the promoters (while not yet on this list) have maintend
that they will not tolerate further such actions.  I'll cross-post their
response at the end of this list (so maybe you guys can stop bandwagoning on
this and listen to what other have to say).

Now... I have a thing or two to say about breakdancing and the incident on
Saturday (and this is my opinion only so let it reflect solely on me)...

I've always been torn on the issue of it.  Breakdancing is part of our
culture, and with that I have no problems.

HOWEVER... break circles are completely counter productive and generally a
smack in the face to the dj.  NOTE:  I said break cricles, not breakdancers.

At Moda, the breakers took a perfectly happening dancefloor and cut it in
HALF.  Not only does a break circle cause people to stop what they are doing
and gather around to watch.... it often becomes very disrespectufl.  As the
circle grows, people get pushed out of the way.    I've seen it get rude and
normal dancers get INTENTIONALY pushed out of the way by the spectators and
that is SO FUCKED UP.  For example, a year or so ago at Feast, I had 20
people come up to me and asked me to stop the break circle that formed
during Evan's set becuase they were rude and were pushing people around on
the dancefloor.

Look at things from Moda's perspective ... the break circle was RIGHT IN THE
WAY.   When you walk into Moda you have two options... turn right or turn
left.  If you were to have turned left while the break circle was going on
you would have ran smack into the break circle and the path to the mezzanine
and main vip stairs was BLOCKED.  I stood in the VIP watching this
happening... thinking to myself  "I feel so sorry for Derrick that he has to
come to Cleveland on a late flight, and then walk into a room that stops
dancing so they can watch ONE person dance".

AGAIN... don't get me wrong I am not saying the break circle is the fault of
the breaker.   HOWEVER, there should be some common sense going on.  A place
like Moda does not lend itself to break circles.  I have seen respectful
breakers who break it up when the circle starts to take over the majority of
the dancefloor.   At WMC in Miami, there was a small break circle going on
at one of the parties.   They would stop whenever it got to be more than a
few people watching and it never caused a problem or got in the way.  It
seems to me, knowing that a break dance circle disrupts the majority of a
dancefloor, a person might want to ask permission if it is allowed.  By
doing it..you are effecting a lot of people... from the dj to the people who
get pushed off the floor.  RESPECT.

Another thing, Moda had originally hired Nefty and some of his friends as
original dancers for the club.  Obviously some breakers have taken their art
beyond the realm of a break circle.  Maybe at the end of the night when the
floor is empty... maybe... but never during the peak hour of the main room.

In Cleveland there were two promoters who treated breakers proper in
clubs...   George Driver @ Bottom Line set up the breakdance mat on the
opposite end of the club from the dancefloor and dj.  BRILLIANT IDEA.
Preserving the breakdance part of the culture and not letting it get in the
way of the dj or the people who wanted to dance.   Nick Dunlap @ Europa...
who put the breakers on stage beside the dj.   Propa.

So what I am saying is breaking=good, circles=bad.   As a good breaker you
should want to glorify your art instead of making it look bad because of the
negative press (circles) surrounding it.

Finally.... NO ONE agrees with how Moda dealt with this situation.  In fact,
it was most likely a couple of over active bouncers.  I understand it has
alredy been dealt with.  HOWER.... look at yourselves....

So if we are to follow the ignorant example set by pb-cle-politics the
following statement must be true:
IF OVERZEALOUS BOUNCERS = FUCK MODA,
THEN RUDE SPECTATORS = FUCK BREAKERS

***PLEASE NOT THATE I DID NOT SAY FUCK BREAKERS... I AM MERELY MAKING A
POINT***

So think about things before bandwagoning, please.

Doug Burkhart

....here are Mythodic's responses from another message board....

"In reply to the comment about the breakdancers getting thrown out...I
wasn't right there to see what happened but from what i heard it was a bit
of bullshit...we want to apologize straight off the bat because that is not
what WE are about and feel horrible that this has happened. If anyone knows
who the guy was that got thrown out please ask him to contact me as i would
like to speak with him. He can email me or call my office.
As far as things in future...we spoke with the mgmt of Moda last night and
will be speaking with them the first part of the week to ensure that
something like this doesnt happen again. It definately was uncalled for and
totally feel bad for the situation. This definately will not happen in the
future. As most of yo uknow we try to promote a great party atmosphere where
EVERYONE is welcome. and last night was just an isolated incedent that we
will have to take care of. So once again from everyone associated with
Ritual we deeply apologize for this and again if anyone has any contact info
for the gentlemen that got thrown out please forward it
tomichael@mythodic.com thanks and see everyone next sat for dj micro "

and

"Well if anyone has any contact info for that guy please drop me an email as
i would like to get in contact with him. you can email me
atmichael@mythodic.com

Again the security staff was way out of line and are definately not used to
handling situations with care. This has and will be addressed further so
that we do not have this problem in the future.

Once again thanks to everyone that made it out even though the weather was
horrible. Hope to see you guys out for many more events in the future.
Cheers. "

I agree with Amy that you cannot really hate the establishment but what I do disagree with was how the situation with Dan(Skillz) was handled.  A first hand account I heard was that a bouncer made a hand guesture to Dan and that he did not see it.  Okay so they don't want breakdancing well the bouncer can approach Dan and ask him to stop and since I've known Dan for so long he would have.  Second the bouncer grabbed him by the neck to drag him out which not even the police are allowed to do so I would suspect that is illegeal.  In Davids case in Miami yeah he got kicked out for dumb reasons but at least they asked him to leave and didn't put him in a headlock and run him out the door.  I don't blame the promotors the djs or the owners (to and extent).  I blame the over steroid induced bouncers that hit on the girls and shove all the guys.  Now if this matter is brought to the attention of the owners and they do nothing then I would have to boycott the establishment.  This is the
 exact thing I used to read about in Mixmag about the bouncers in England being overly agressive and in England they corrected by problem by training them properly.  I hope that the owner of Moda will maybe hear abou the situation and try to resolve it properly by maybe explaing to them that it is a respectable place so treat everyone with respect, and then the bouncers will see that we will respect them back.  That is my 2 cents on this situation now I want my change. 

amy@headrushmusic.com wrote:I can't really comment on the incident involving Skillz because I did not see it first-hand. I have heard several first-hand accounts, and I hope that both sides can forgive, forget, and move on. But it has me thinking of some larger questions.

I've noticed an increase in this kind of stuff overall in the past two years in all clubs across the country. It's not just Moda that seems to wield a heavy hand. I have witnessed similar incidents clubs in DC, Boston, New York City, Chicago and Miami, and have even been involved in them...They are not fun, and not something anyone wants. But it is, unfortunately, a price I think we have to pay to further our scene. Examples:

Last year at the Conference, David was asked to leave a party simply for bending over to get a lighter out of his lower pocket and lighting someone else's cigarette. The bouncer *thought* there was contraband involved, and there was no "due process" for Dave to prove himself otherwise. The fact that David had nothing on him but a lighter and a pack of cigarettes didn't matter at that point. The bouncer caught something out of the corner of his eye and it was his word against David's. It's a private establishment, and you are there on their terms. They reserve the right to oust you if they for whatever reason feel you are breaking their rules.

I've also seen friends have to leave Vinyl (ARC), and ARC probably one of the THE most friendly scenes in New York City. It's a CYA for the clubs to stay in business.

I don't envy the position of clubs who are forced to play the middleman between law enforcement and party-goers, all the while maintaining the reputation of their club as appealing to both sides. Especially in today's hostile legal environment, and especially here in Cleveland where stories of fights, shootings, and even deaths in the Flats in recent years have caused officials to scrutinize security practices and have caused bouncers to throw around heavy hands. I remember many fights breaking out along W6th St. as I was flyering last Summer for the Summer Series. I'm sure the last thing Moda wants is that kind of crowd moving in. Do I agree with what they did in Skillz' case? No, because I know our community wouldn't intentionally try to rile up a club. but, can I understand why clubs have tough policies? Yes, I can see it. Sure the bouncer in particular may have been a royal jerk but is it reason to hate the whole institution?

So, I guess what I'm saying is that like any good relationship, there is compromise and there has to be some understanding on behalf of both parties for the relationship to grow. Club owners and their individual employees need to see and understand that most "ravers" coming above-ground to dance and celebrate good music are generally going to be respectful of the ground rules they have to have to stay in business, and party-goers in turn need to realize that there are some things they need to sacrifice in order to continue to see talent brought to their cities. I guess in the spirit of MLK day today I'm thinking that the strongest form of protest is understanding.

We can bitch about drink prices, doorp policies and so forth, but as someone said to me on Saturday night, "No place is perfect and we all can't have everything we want all the time." The utopia we all strive for is as ethereal as the ways we try to describe our joy in the music, and it is something we all have to work at. It does not get handed to us. Like any love affair, we have to be willing to forgive and move on if it is to last.

Subject: {pb-cle} A word from Mythodic .....

Hello to everyone....First off I would like to say that I have read all =
of
the posts/reviews on here and would just like to comment.

Saturday night was supposed to be one of the best nights of house music =
to
hit Cleveland (or ohio for that matter) in a LOOONG time.  And you know =
what
it was. =20

However the incident with the breaker (Skillz) if that's who it was, was
pretty much bullshit.  The security was way out of line in how he =
handled
the situation and for this (even though I have no control over the =
staff) am
sorry for this situation.  I was not present to see what happened except =
for
at the end as they took him out the front doors. (Again the guy was way =
out
of line in how he removed him). This situation is going to be a he said =
she
said contest on what or how it started but the security guard told mgmt =
that
he told the guy SEVERAL times to stop bumping into ppl and he wouldn't =
stop.
He had received a few complaints from ppl. This is why he started =
watching
the guy.  Now how do you handle a situation like this.  Well the =
security
guy should have spoken to him off to the side and gave one last stern
warning to be careful and respectful to the other patrons.  IF not then =
ASK
him to leave and walk him out.  Not carry the guy out in a choke hold.
AGAIN VERY WRONG on behalf of the security staff.

Im not making ANY excuses for Moda and have spoken 3 times since Sat =
with
the mgmt and ownership of the club.  In our conversations we are trying =
to
outline ways that this type of incident NEVER happens again.  If you =
guys
know about Moda you know 2 of the 4 days a wk they are open it is hip =
hop
and the crowd is so much rougher.  These guys have been "programmed" to
handle situations aggressively.  Most of those guys haven't had a busy =
Sat
night in there in months and really don't know how to handle a situation
like this.  Again no excuse.=20

Bottom line is this.  Myself, Donnie and all the staff behind Ritual =
truly
apologize not only to Skillz but to everyone that had to witness what
happened on Sat night.  It was totally uncalled for and definitely hurt =
what
was to be a truly incredible night.  This will definitely not happen =
again.


We work very hard to create a great party atmosphere where everyone is
welcome and all walks of life can come and dance and have fun TOGETHER.
This venue in the past has not lent itself to this idea so it is going =
to
take time.  We have got them to drop their age range from 21 and over to =
19
and over and drop their dress code.  It is a transition period and we =
are
trying to work through all the negatives that are associated with this =
venue
and the stigma's it has had from the past.  This is definitely one of =
the
nicest venue's in the Country and it just so happens to be in Cleveland. =
=20

So in saying all of this we once again apologize for everything that
happened on Sat night.  I feel horrible that it happened and am working =
to
ensure that it NEVER happens again.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Breakdancing, Moda, etc.

You know, maybe having a break circl for the entire night might get annoying 
but you're crazy to think it's a slap in the face to the dj.  I absolutely 
love it when people break during my sets and I know plenty of other that dig 
it as well.

As far as Moda, all it takes is for something like this to happen for all of 
us to lose any respect we might of had for the place, and I never had any 
for the place anyway so I say FUCK Moda too.  Sounds exactly like the good 
old cleveland I know, kick ass, ask questions later.  And thats just a 
direct reflection of ownership/management.  Screw you guys, I'm going home!

Just my "from the sideline" comment:  I'm sure that Dan probably has good
grounds for an assault charge from what it sounds like.

That would change behavior of the bouncers there real quick.

maybe im a hippie or something, but ive always thought that
breakdancing takes away from the communal aspect of dance music.
its that exact feeling that makes dance music the big equalizer.
taking that away pisses me off to no end. i like it when people
are good dancers and whatever, but making a spectacle of things is
irritating.

yeah you know one isolated incident of people who act irritating
getting a beatdown is certainly grounds to write off the club
entirely. if youre a fucking moron. wasnt it christ who said "you
who is without sin can cast the first stone"? jesus christ, im
fucking quoting jusus christ and acting like a hippie. all because
breakdancers need attention. fuck that shit. if youre an idiot and
dont want to give a club that booked a big time house deejay who
might actually deserve the accolades he gets because of something
that they couldnt necessarily control at the time without giving
them a chance to correct their poor judgement, i dont know what to
say to you. that was a very long sentence. fuck you all and no
thanks to people who didnt come out on saturday. ya bunch of
fucking pussies.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I remember I was at Moda awhile back when King Brit, Doug B. and a live band were among the talents on the lineup. It was one of those huge Salem-sponsored parties. That night, there was ALL KINDS OF BREAKIN goin on amongst the packed venue with no interference via bouncers or those in the head count. It's rather fruitless to cast such strong and hateful comments out into the Midwestern universe. Since this breakdancing issue was an isolated one, it may be beneficial to the whiners to absorb some perspective.Also, what's up Doug? Would you please email me at alieng2002@yahoo.com?

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Breakdancing, Moda, etc.

Just thought I'd chip in my 2 cents' worth. Break dancing is very cool, and
I enjoy watching the breakers, but as one who can't/doesn't break-dance
myself, it's annoying and a little vibe-killing to have a circle going for
more than a song or two. I guess in my opinion it's like salt on my dinner -
a little bit really enhances the flavor of the dish, but more than that
makes me want to quit eating and leave the table. If a club had a designated
area, on stage, or somewhere else out of the way, but in a visible area, for
the breakers, that would be ideal. I don't think anybody here is arguing
that those who break-dance at parties and club events aren't talented, or
are doing anything wrong - on the contrary, but it does become more of a
distraction and deterrence for others who would like to just dance
"normally" when it is on the main floor.

I wasn't there Saturday (had to work late), but from what I've heard, the
incident at Moda sounds like it's entirely the bouncer's fault. I have seen
some rude circle-dwellers before, but none have ever done anything that
warranted a head locked escort out of the club. That's just ridiculous and
uncalled for. With all the efforts to keep the clubs drug-free, owners
should start administering drug tests to the bouncers as well to make sure
they don't go into 'roid rage and do something stupid like that...

<< yeah you know one isolated incident of people who

So this was justified then???? Tom, you are way too
smart to think violence is warranted in a situation
like that. The one thing we've all agreed upon till
now is this clown went way, WAY overboard. I wonder
what you would say if it was someone YOU knew who was
treated like that.

If this guy doesn't face at least a reprimand and the
club won't admit it's mistake, correct it by
designating space, or clearly posting signs, than
unfortunately the only real recourse is a boycott,
which in many ways is bad for all parties concerned.

BTW I do agree to a certain extent that circles can
screw up the dancefloor and should be broken up when
they are interfering with others or become too large.
You do this by getting the crowd to disperse. Not by
grabbing someone while they are dancing and pulling
that stormtrooper bullshit. I dunno, the idea of
telling someone how they can or can't dance frightens
me, it stifles creativity, it's VERY Orwellian. Dude
got punished for being a good dancer, think about it.

Bottom line is this security worker used the 'kill an
ant w/ a sledgehammer' approach and something should
be done about it or it will happen again. Okay, thats
enough I think I have made my opinion quite clear...
you may think I'm wrong (qouting Tom) "if youre a
fucking moron"

And yeah, I prob. should have said fuck the ice/snowy
shit and drove out to PB last Sat. night, I blew
chunks on that one. At least I will finally see Mr.
Duvante this Fri. night.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Breakdancing, Moda, etc.

Understand that there are two parts of this discussion.  A) Issues of
breakdancing which should be completely unreleated to B) this isolated
incident at Moda.  Mythodic has spoken and they have promised to remedy the
situation.  Throwing around silly words like "boycott and fuck so and so" is
retarded.  Are you part of the solution or part of the problem?   If you are
part of the solution then you would be on the phone with Moda, right?  There
are few other promoters in the world doing things on the same scale as
Mythodic and Disco Donnie who would take the time to respond and appologize
on a mailing list like this. Props Micheal, Donnie, and the rest of
Mythodic.

By the way... I worked for Moda a while and was fired by them... yet I hold
no grudges beause A)  I respect the Promoter and B) I realize it is the
coolest fucking club in the midwest.... there is nothing else that can
compare to it.   Have you been there?  If you answer is no you really should
check it out for youself.

Now... if you want to argue my opinions of break dance circles... here are
my direct points:

** Breakers and break circles are NOT one in the same.  People can break
without attracting attention.  If breakdancing is about expression... why do
you need people standing around to watch?

** If you have 100 people dancing to your set and 50 of them STOP to
showcase ONE PERSON it is not cool.... expecially if you are a national
headlining dj.  Now if the room is near empty, and no one is dancing
anyhow... that is different story.  If you are in a small, intimate room
that only holds 100 people... that is a completely different story.

** While I have ZERO problems with breakers, spectators often get out of
control and push around the people who came to dance. I think breakdancers
should be aware of that and regulate themselves so bouncers do not have to.
This is destructive to the potential of the night.   I look back to when I
used to go out dancing 4 nights a week... if I had gotten pushed out of the
way by someone... I might have not wanted to go back.  It is the same thing
as getting pushed around by some meathead clubber that doesn't say i'm
sorry.

** Some clubs handle it properly... giving breakers a great opportunity to
showcase their talent.  I applaude them!

Subject: {pb-cle} Geek Related:  anyone have spare SDRAM <= 64mb

I just got this ibm 300 gl computer with 200 mhz processor for $10 at 
a pc show over the weekend and looking to get it all upgraded to use 
as a backup server.  Sooooo first thing is the memory, it only comes 
with 32 mb.  Looked online and it supports up to two 64mb chips, 
total 128mb, that's fine.  the smallest I have it 128mb, which the 
computer didn't like too well.  Looked online and I can get it real 
cheap, but then I figured someone on here may have some old memory 
laying around that they have no use for but don't want to just toss.  
Anyone has it, here are the specs on it

. Use only 3.3 volt, unbuffered, 168-pin DIMMs (SDRAM or EDO DRAM)
. Only nonparity modules are supported.
. Any sequence of module sizes is allowed.
. A mix of SDRAM and EDO modules is supported.
. Modules have a maximum height of 3.175 cm (1.25 in.). Larger 
modules might
prevent the use of the bottom expansion slot on the riser card.
. SIMMs (single inline memory modules) are not supported.

Any info hit me up privately, preferable someone within close 
proximity to me (streetsboro, near kent)

i wasnt saying that. i was pointing out that more than a few 
people are going to find people breakdancing in a big circle to be 
irritating. its not like the guy was just standing there minding 
his own business. obviously the situation shouldnt have escalated 
like it did, theres no excuse for overreacting. however ive found 
that participating in the smallest amount of activities that annoy 
people leads to not getting beaten down by security guards.

>like that. The one thing we've all agreed upon till

>what you would say if it was someone YOU knew who was
>treated like that.

well to be frank id say that no one i know would be breakdancing, 
thankfully : ) but aside from that, this was a one time incident. 
as someone on here pointed out there has been breakdancing at the 
club at other times. for this to escalate like it did indicates to 
me that there was some other issue at hand. if you act like a 
prick you get beat down sometimes. not that it was justified but 
damn, ive never been thrown out of a club mainly because i try 
really hard not to bother anyone else.

i think the history of the venue accepting breakdancing before 
this one incident is more than enough to assume that this was a 
one time only type deal. i dont think the guy needs to be made a 
fool of for doing what might have been otherwise acceptable 
actions (say if the person had really been causing a problem). you 
cant control people who work for you at all times. if the club is 
professional (which it seems it is) they will discipline the 
bouncer in the way they see fit.

im biased but i look at it as showing off. and that shit is just 
basically unnecessary in the club atmosphere. if people knew their 
place, none of this would have happened. as i said before, that 
doesnt excuse the violence, but if you mind your own business i 
find that you dont have problems like this.

i just think its wrong to assume that the club wont do anything 
about it. writing some letters to them explaining your concerns 
would likely be more helpful than punishing the whole club with 
your boycott for the actions of one over the top security guard.

yeah but you wont get to see him live. he's a damn good deejay, 
but his live show is much much much better.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Breakdancing, Moda, etc.

Another thought about breaking (since discussion of this incident @ Moda is
done)...

I'd have to assume that breaking in the Akron area is similar to that in
Kent.  The few times I've been to Kent... the kids who were breaking had
been minding their own business and no one really payed much attention to
them.  It was cool and it was a proper interaction.

Running a teen night back in the day... i would watch a break circle
devestate the dancefloor and watch those kids push the kids who didn't fit
in out of the way.  I hated it when I was djing in a club not even
understanding the concept of beatmatching.

Watching one of those SAME kids get older and mature, I would see him have
the breakdance thing going on in the big underground club... out of the way
of everyone else.  I really started to appreciate it as part of the culture
and understaood the art form.

I've watched the same kid progress from break-circle types to paid dancers
inside a club. (I've seen this happen in three diferent cities).

In Cleveland, however, when a circle forms it almost always gets carried
away.  I have watched a circle take a dancefloor from 200 strong down to
ZIP.  Maybe its just a Cleveland thing where if one person is breaking...
everyone has to stop and watch.  I don't know.  Maybe it has to do with the
surroundings.... in a place like Annabelle's or Robinhood people are used to
seeing this happen.  Would you go to Posh and start breaking?   I don't
know... maybe some would.   But I bet it has something to do with when the
crowd isn't used to it.  I'd still stand strong that I like to see break
dancing highlighted as part of the night or venue... but not part of the
dancefloor.  It's an artform that goes hand in hand with our music... but it
is also something else.

I am *not* justifing the bouncers... i just wanted to start a conversation
about breaking.  NOT because that bouncer was justified, but because
watching that whole circle form really bothered me... it really devestated
that dancefloor.  All I could do was think about Derrick, how his first
flight was cancelled, how he came right from the airport to the club, how it
must have felt to walk in and just jump on the decks without getting in his
groove... seeing a jumping dancefloor when he walked in... then almost
instantly get treated to a club full of people turning their backs on him to
watch one person dance at a time..

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Breakdancing, Moda, etc.

Break circles don't bother me when they don't get in my way.

I have nothing against breaking, but it can get a little ridiculous.

Its like okay...the dancefloor just fucking stops. Everybody gather round 
and watch this guy do flips for the next 45 minutes. Fantastic. Oops I just 
go pushed in the back and knocked over some fly honey double-fisting cran 
vodkas because a break circle imploded the dancefloor.  30 people stopped 
dancing so Joe Millionare can parade around with wheels on his shoes, and 
now I'm in a corner next to some fat slob. You people are in my way.

Now I feel like an asshole because I'm not stopping to watch this guy kick 
some ho in the face and call it art.

Actually if that happened it would be worth it, and I would definitely pay 
to see it...

Can we get back to dancing please?

They don't bother me when they aren't a disruption but...whatever. Thats 
just my opinion. I've got nothing against breaks, breakers, bboys, bgirls, 
jo mamma, jo dadda, his uncle, big brother ...just against small dancefloors 
I should say.

Sucks that Skillz got kicked out. Skillz is the man. he should at least got 
to kick a ho in the face before they booted him. What a rip.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

i've never laughed harder than when a few people started breaking to one 
of my live PAs.... definately made my night and i thought was funny as

then maybe as a highly paid dj, you should work on getting those 50 
spectators back into the groove and dancing? because obviously they 
would rather watch someone else dance than dance themselves?  food for 
thought?
i don't dance a whole lot (and am "that white guy" when i do) so i 
usually just watch. and i find breakdancers more fun than people doing 
the raver skip or whatever bopping up and down in one place. okay 
scantily clad hot girls bopping in one place will get me to look away 
from breakers.  hmmmm...  moda needs to hire more of them perhaps?  to 
distract us from watching breakers?  more food for thought?
hahahahhaaa.

Nah... that's a different story.

I didn't mean to come accross saying breakdancing was disrespectful.
Breaking up a perfectly good dancefloor is. In this instance it was early in
the night as well and no one was dancing yet.  I was happy to have them on
the floor.  If people had gathered around them dramaticly, I might have
gotten flustered or upset.  I too loved that fact that there were obvious
ravers in attendance... gotta love diversity.  One of the things that always
impresses me about Ritual events... even the ones I attended in Columbus.
Always a great mix of people.

Well, how do you do that?  Do you provide "instant gratification" and make
people go "fuck yeah" by playing a remix of something they know?  That would
be sacficing the music at the expense of the dancefloor.  Certainly that's
not the only way, but the circle that night happened less than 15 minutes
after Derrick went on, didn't it?  That's what bumbed me out.

Interesting side note from a few years back.... someone once said to me
"Only in Cleveland do they break to trance, they would get laughed out by
any real breakers".  Not my opinion, but something to think about/discuss?

Yah... Derrick should have dropped some nu skewl breaks.  I'd have approved,
and it would cater to the breakers.

Not that Im like the ultra breaker or anything...in fact I suck...but if
you've noticed, on the floor/ground routines don't really keep in tempo to
the music. Most moves you might as well be breaking to classical. The tempo
is used mostly for setting a pace and "swinging" before the dancer begins
doing the moves...any input from acctual breakers?

Subject: {pb-cle} Dance Like Nobody is Watching !


I personaly take dancing as the highest form of a compliment to a dj
any kind break, raver hop, SNL head bop etc. . .
There is a reason for my life's motto to be "Dance like Nobody is Watching"
1-so anyone can go out and shake it
2-so you or I(the dancer) can get totaly into the groove and not have to 
entertain !


the  heart of the issue is:

> > >From: "Doug Burkhart"
Moda does not lend itself to break circles

------MODA has too small of a dance floor for when ppl are just "normaly 
dancing"
I as 1 person feel crowded and do not have enough room for even myself, so i 
usually slip to the back of the room or the outside to have my own space and 
let loose.
I would like to believe that other TRUE dancers who are dancing all nite 
anyway usually atleast at first by themselves would have to feel the same 
way.
----. . . here's how i can possibly see by the formation of a circle as 
disrespecting:
-by creating more space for yourself to dance, you take away from others
-this is why early or late circles are recommended---the floor is thinner 
and can support it


~~~then this really kewl thing happens:
random(non-dancers) ppl who show up early, or more random ppl who stick 
around to the very end
start telling their friends "man if ya get there early enough you really get 
to see the breakers go nutz they have the whole floor to themselves" or 
"dude if you hang til the end after the crowd thins out the breakers totaly 
let loose !" and  the vibe spreads, and more and more ppl get hooked !


could go way more in depth but . . .
I think plenty has been said

In my opinion this guy should be fired and I would prefer to know who he 
is(i.e. a name) so as to know which every club he may get remployed at to 
possibly not patron as well

apparently, it was from eating it not smoking it... if
this IS true, while I feel for the recently departed

This is an EXTREMELY rare thing but it won't matter
the media and the war on drugs idiots are going to run
with this one BIG TIME. This could be a huge setback.

Haha, you forgot the link in a pot story. Ha. Sorry :)

But anyway, I still think the LD50 of said substance is pretty dern 
high. I think the fact that they totally left out the cause of death 
really sort of bunks the whole thing. No one DIES from a drug overdose, 
it just influences the way they go. Bunch of FUD if you ask me.

Yeah, Bill and I were amazed how many people stick around, we were trying to 
predict how many people were going to leave once you came on, and hardly 
anyone did.

Sadly, it doesn't matter anymore.  The media is going to go ballistic over 
this and the whole war on drugs ads are going to be quoting this story like 
crazy, especially if anyone proposes a downgrade of it.  I find it 
interesting enough that this happened last year and they are just now 
mentioning it before it getting rescheduled at the end of the month.

an interesting comment to make -- an outsider's perspective.  It was the
first time we had a crowd @ 2.30!

That's amazing considering between 95 and 97 there were 4 NEW area 
codes created.  330, 440, 740 and 937.  Before that Ohio had 4 
area codes, 216, 513, 419, and 614.  

Hence the "if you from 'dere, it's all 216."  Either you is, or 
you isn't, or you rewritin the history books like dubya.

I found your cock next to the word 'bullshit' in the dick-shun-
ary.

Subject: {pb-cle} nrr: Bush Conspiracy Theory Generator

http://www.buttafly.com/bush/index.php

"George W. Bush caused the Cubs to lose to the Marlins in Game 7 of the 
National League Championship Series so that Rush Limbaugh and oil companies 
could kill Michael Moore"

"George W. Bush rigged the 2000 election so that big corporations, 
Republicans, the Jews, Ann Coulter, and white men could oppress Al Franken."

"George W. Bush gave Iraq reconstruction contracts to his friends so that 
Republicans, Rush Limbaugh, and big corporations could oppress welfare 
recipients."

And my favorite:

George W. Bush rigged the 2000 election so that big corporations, Ann 
Coulter, and white men could invade women.

Hmmm, I live in the 330 and it's a good 30 minutes before I hit anywhere
in the 216. No one considers Akron or Kent parts of Cleveland -- they're a
good 40-50 minutes away and definitely in the 330. Shite, you even have to
pass through the 440 to get to the 216. Blah.

614! Hollah!

I felt like some sort of Akron trash when they moved my hometown from 
216 to 330. It really hurt my feelings.

Dave (Deviant) is definately worth seeing for anyone
who digs on deep, dark, thumping prog, not that he's
limited to that by any means.  IMO he should be able
to tear both micro and sandra collins to pieces.

Anyone know if Mythodic is planning on doing any
smaller-scale shows in the area (ala john acquaviva in
c'bus last december...I believe that was a mythodic
show)?  Mike, you're on this list, right?  Any chance
of that?  Wish and Spy are both good venues for
medium-sized shows, although both of their sound
systems could use a little help these days.

My .02,
Jamie

Forgiving is one thing.....enabling it to continue is another.  Should Skillz have to forgive Moda?---hell no!  Should people NOT let this incident be an excuse not to go there...perhaps.  Like Jamie did say, this incident was not in relation to Mythodic and Jess and they want to alleviate and even apologize for an incident that was not of there doing and props to them for stepping up and doing so (As well as trying to maintian a positive vibe). Should they be punished and their efforts go to waste?  No.  should people like Doug or Brad who played in addition to DC, lose support because the crowd doesn't want to deal with a staff like Moda's?  That would certainly be a shame, they deserve to be heard and in larger venues. 
 
However...what we're supposed to just forgive and bend over and take it?  Continue watch friends and relations take abuse they do not deserve...be it physical or verbal? (And both has occurred there to the most underserving of people) Especially after people spent their hard earned money to get in an establishment, then their hard earned money to drink/support otherwise only to be kicked out or watch friends be humiliated, belittled, etc... for no reason.  
 
There are many options....voicing your opinion is a big one.  It makes no sense for Moda to impose ridiculous punishments on it's patrons if the interest is keeping out riffraff.....They are making a common business mistake of not knowing or making any attempts to get to know their clientele.  If they don't respect the current crowd Ritual has brought in they are not going to HAVE a crowd...the money dropping W. 6th trendsetters for the most part got bored and are gone, they're pissing off the heads/ravers etc.. with bad vibe, there just isn't much left....
 
Also at the same time, I don't believe "Moda" has "asked" for forgiveness....Ritual and Mythodic did for something they didn't even do.  Honestly, Skillz got it right Fuck Moda.  Support Ritual/Mythodic/Jess as best you can though within keeping your system of values.  However, especially when there are tons of other clubs in Cleveland who have been doing things right, why should we have a pity party for Moda.  They (Other clubs--and) have many of the same pressures, but don't bend to them.  It'll be the day I see someone get kicked out of Touch or Abbasso for the same circumstances.  
Yeah we should be understanding of the pressures on clubs, but a club really should be much more respectful of it's patrons.  It is a business...and in any business, customers are your lifeblood.

I can't really comment on the incident involving Skillz because I did not see it first-hand. I have heard several first-hand accounts, and I hope that both sides can forgive, forget, and move on. But it has me thinking of some larger questions.

I've noticed an increase in this kind of stuff overall in the past two years in all clubs across the country. It's not just Moda that seems to wield a heavy hand. I have witnessed similar incidents clubs in DC, Boston, New York City, Chicago and Miami, and have even been involved in them...They are not fun, and not something anyone wants. But it is, unfortunately, a price I think we have to pay to further our scene. Examples:

Last year at the Conference, David was asked to leave a party simply for bending over to get a lighter out of his lower pocket and lighting someone else's cigarette. The bouncer *thought* there was contraband involved, and there was no "due process" for Dave to prove himself otherwise. The fact that David had nothing on him but a lighter and a pack of cigarettes didn't matter at that point. The bouncer caught something out of the corner of his eye and it was his word against David's. It's a private establishment, and you are there on their terms. They reserve the right to oust you if they for whatever reason feel you are breaking their rules.

I've also seen friends have to leave Vinyl (ARC), and ARC probably one of the THE most friendly scenes in New York City. It's a CYA for the clubs to stay in business.

I don't envy the position of clubs who are forced to play the middleman between law enforcement and party-goers, all the while maintaining the reputation of their club as appealing to both sides. Especially in today's hostile legal environment, and especially here in Cleveland where stories of fights, shootings, and even deaths in the Flats in recent years have caused officials to scrutinize security practices and have caused bouncers to throw around heavy hands. I remember many fights breaking out along W6th St. as I was flyering last Summer for the Summer Series. I'm sure the last thing Moda wants is that kind of crowd moving in. Do I agree with what they did in Skillz' case? No, because I know our community wouldn't intentionally try to rile up a club. but, can I understand why clubs have tough policies? Yes, I can see it. Sure the bouncer in particular may have been a royal jerk but is it reason to hate the whole institution?

So, I guess what I'm saying is that like any good relationship, there is compromise and there has to be some understanding on behalf of both parties for the relationship to grow. Club owners and their individual employees need to see and understand that most "ravers" coming above-ground to dance and celebrate good music are generally going to be respectful of the ground rules they have to have to stay in business, and party-goers in turn need to realize that there are some things they need to sacrifice in order to continue to see talent brought to their cities. I guess in the spirit of MLK day today I'm thinking that the strongest form of protest is understanding.

We can bitch about drink prices, doorp policies and so forth, but as someone said to me on Saturday night, "No place is perfect and we all can't have everything we want all the time." The utopia we all strive for is as ethereal as the ways we try to describe our joy in the music, and it is something we all have to work at. It does not get handed to us. Like any love affair, we have to be willing to forgive and move on if it is to last.

I couldn't agree more.  If anyone could come up with an answer as to how to support our locals @ Moda (Dave, for example, who'll probably play a great deep prog set and doesn't deserve to lose support)  without sacrificing our value system...(Don't FEED the raver-eating monster!) please let me know as well.  I suppose, I'd really like to get a petition to Moda to recommend they start listening to their promoters more, who KNOW the crowd and follow more of the promoter suggestions (aka Mythodic). I really respect all that Jess is doing there too, and would hate to see her lose support due to some idiot bouncer, or bitchy bartender. 
 
 
 

 
Dave (Deviant) is definately worth seeing for anyone
who digs on deep, dark, thumping prog, not that he's
limited to that by any means. IMO he should be able
to tear both micro and sandra collins to pieces.

Anyone know if Mythodic is planning on doing any
smaller-scale shows in the area (ala john acquaviva in
c'bus last december...I believe that was a mythodic
show)? Mike, you're on this list, right? Any chance
of that? Wish and Spy are both good venues for
medium-sized shows, although both of their sound
systems could use a little help these days.

My .02,
Jamie

Hey yeah...that one was great part of the night when I was the *pimp-girl* with the boys. There we were, totally looking uncool I agree.  Honestly though, what a shame as I think back because at that point of the eve, though the crowd was thin...the music was so smooth and masterfully chosen (Thanks to Doug)  Honestly, a fantastic set....And yes, there was breaking, and it was cool to watch (And yeah, no one got busted then, and there was always plenty of room all night, so that excuse doesn't hold up).  There was some fanastic moves from a small set of ravers as well, even Jamie and Alex got down for awhile...and I expected such a cool vibe to last all night.

Subject: RE: Re: {pb-cle} derrick carter review

Forgiving is one thing.....enabling it to continue is another.  Should Skillz have to forgive Moda?---hell no!  Should people NOT let this incident be an excuse not to go there...perhaps.  Like Jamie did say, this incident was not in relation to Mythodic and Jess and they want to alleviate and even apologize for an incident that was not of there doing and props to them for stepping up and doing so (As well as trying to maintian a positive vibe). Should they be punished and their efforts go to waste?  No.  should people like Doug or Brad who played in addition to DC, lose support because the crowd doesn't want to deal with a staff like Moda's?  That would certainly be a shame, they deserve to be heard and in larger venues. 
 
However...what we're supposed to just forgive and bend over and take it?  Continue watch friends and relations take abuse they do not deserve...be it physical or verbal? (And both has occurred there to the most underserving of people) Especially after people spent their hard earned money to get in an establishment, then their hard earned money to drink/support otherwise only to be kicked out or watch friends be humiliated, belittled, etc... for no reason.  
 
There are many options....voicing your opinion is a big one.  It makes no sense for Moda to impose ridiculous punishments on it's patrons if the interest is keeping out riffraff.....They are making a common business mistake of not knowing or making any attempts to get to know their clientele.  If they don't respect the current crowd Ritual has brought in they are not going to HAVE a crowd...the money dropping W. 6th trendsetters for the most part got bored and are gone, they're pissing off the heads/ravers etc.. with bad vibe, there just isn't much left....
 
Also at the same time, I don't believe "Moda" has "asked" for forgiveness....Ritual and Mythodic did for something they didn't even do.  Honestly, Skillz got it right Fuck Moda.  Support Ritual/Mythodic/Jess as best you can though within keeping your system of values.  However, especially when there are tons of other clubs in Cleveland who have been doing things right, why should we have a pity party for Moda.  They (Other clubs--and) have many of the same pressures, but don't bend to them.  It'll be the day I see someone get kicked out of Touch or Abbasso for the same circumstances.  
Yeah we should be understanding of the pressures on clubs, but a club really should be much more respectful of it's patrons.  It is a business...and in any business, customers are your lifeblood.

I can't really comment on the incident involving Skillz because I did not see it first-hand. I have heard several first-hand accounts, and I hope that both sides can forgive, forget, and move on. But it has me thinking of some larger questions.

I've noticed an increase in this kind of stuff overall in the past two years in all clubs across the country. It's not just Moda that seems to wield a heavy hand. I have witnessed similar incidents clubs in DC, Boston, New York City, Chicago and Miami, and have even been involved in them...They are not fun, and not something anyone wants. But it is, unfortunately, a price I think we have to pay to further our scene. Examples:

Last year at the Conference, David was asked to leave a party simply for bending over to get a lighter out of his lower pocket and lighting someone else's cigarette. The bouncer *thought* there was contraband involved, and there was no "due process" for Dave to prove himself otherwise. The fact that David had nothing on him but a lighter and a pack of cigarettes didn't matter at that point. The bouncer caught something out of the corner of his eye and it was his word against David's. It's a private establishment, and you are there on their terms. They reserve the right to oust you if they for whatever reason feel you are breaking their rules.

I've also seen friends have to leave Vinyl (ARC), and ARC probably one of the THE most friendly scenes in New York City. It's a CYA for the clubs to stay in business.

I don't envy the position of clubs who are forced to play the middleman between law enforcement and party-goers, all the while maintaining the reputation of their club as appealing to both sides. Especially in today's hostile legal environment, and especially here in Cleveland where stories of fights, shootings, and even deaths in the Flats in recent years have caused officials to scrutinize security practices and have caused bouncers to throw around heavy hands. I remember many fights breaking out along W6th St. as I was flyering last Summer for the Summer Series. I'm sure the last thing Moda wants is that kind of crowd moving in. Do I agree with what they did in Skillz' case? No, because I know our community wouldn't intentionally try to rile up a club. but, can I understand why clubs have tough policies? Yes, I can see it. Sure the bouncer in particular may have been a royal jerk but is it reason to hate the whole institution?

So, I guess what I'm saying is that like any good relationship, there is compromise and there has to be some understanding on behalf of both parties for the relationship to grow. Club owners and their individual employees need to see and understand that most "ravers" coming above-ground to dance and celebrate good music are generally going to be respectful of the ground rules they have to have to stay in business, and party-goers in turn need to realize that there are some things they need to sacrifice in order to continue to see talent brought to their cities. I guess in the spirit of MLK day today I'm thinking that the strongest form of protest is understanding.

We can bitch about drink prices, doorp policies and so forth, but as someone said to me on Saturday night, "No place is perfect and we all can't have everything we want all the time." The utopia we all strive for is as ethereal as the ways we try to describe our joy in the music, and it is something we all have to work at. It does not get handed to us. Like any love affair, we have to be willing to forgive and move on if it is to last.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} more on moda

My inner solution on the matter is realizing that we do have an advocate in the matter: Michael from Mythodic. To get past this, we need to trust again. Because he is a capable negotiator and advocate, I trust that things will improve, and I trust that the parties involved were or will be compensated and given other gestures of reconciliation.

We, too, have never been ones to put up with crap and have called it out...Those who know David and I well know that we'll speak our minds and lay it out there boldly if we feel there's something not right going on. However, my inner radar on this one says another chance is in order.

On a personal note, I know it would mean a lot to both David and I to see a bunch of heads vibing on his sound. It would mean a lot to us to know that everyone could get behind us and the music, and really make the night and the event about the music, not about an incident that happened a week ago.

For all you people who came up to me at various times during the Summer Series or True Fridays and said of Deviant's playing, "Holy shit. Man, would I love to hear this on the big system..." -- now is your chance. 

This is the first time he's been given the big room chance in Cleveland since moving here from New York. It's hard to believe that it's almost been two years exactly since he played Vinyl with Rocher Sanchez on 2/2/02! The flood gates will open on this one! He will not disappoint. He has a 3.5 hour opening slot for Micro...enough time to do you up proper. If it's any more incentive, we'll be giving out copies of the latest promo mix, a nice little package for home or car listening. :)

Come on guys! Let's not argue about this and let's all pass around my
magical blow pop around the circle. Maybe someone can give the bouncers a

People everywhere have had problems with Bouncers/Security.  In many =
different clubs and many different places.  This is not a new problem to =
our scene.  Do you peeps remember when some candy kids got beaten by the =
(was it cops or security) and sent to the hospital at the Cotton Club??? =
Many have had their fair share of issues with over zealous "security".  =
That does not make it right but I am trying really hard to figure out =
why the harsh reaction towards Moda on this list... when there are =
promoters out there who ARE shadey, who rip people off, who intentionaly =
rob kids of pharms and resell them, who do all kinds of really wrong =
things.... but yet no one speaks up about them?

This issue with skillz should NOT have happened... we can all agree on =
that.  Skillz definately has a right to hold a grudge against the club =
and I don't think anyone is arguing that.  The promoters applogized, and =
as I said that is something most would have not taken the time to do.  =
That's all on them... and it is between them.

The thing I want to point out is this:  Everyone on this list has taken =
this discussion into their own hands and created a bit of drama out of =
it.   Is it the club's responsibility to come on this newsgroup (one of =
about 10 of them out there) and apologise to this list (expecially the =
people not even in attendance who have jumped on the bandwagon and added =
their two cents.)?  I don't understand why here on pb-cle-politics this =
is a huge topic of discussion, when it hardly gets mentioned elsewhere?

What I am saying is that this got blown into a whole big snowball of =
stupidity.   Is it a requirement for Moda to know about this list and =
issue an appology to all of you?  Should they put an ad in the plain =
dealer (would any of you even see it) to make sure they get everyone?  =
Maybe rent a billboard (how many would they have to buy to make the =
point known)?   Moda probably does owe skillz an apology... but what if =
they DO seek him out and appologize?  Would he even bother to tell you =
guys that they DID?  Would you even listen if he did?   What about the =
people who read this initially... joined the bandwagon... said fuck =
you... and ignored any outcome? Would it undo the damage that has =
already been done by everyone who has added their opinion to the mix =
(including people have have never even set foot in the club?  ?

In the end... you got to give people chances to learn from their =
mistakes or better themselves.   I've made a lot of them and I try to =
always learn and always get better.   But this list is acting like the =
sentence has been givinen over an incident that obviously should not =
have happened.   These guys have never had this happen before... their =
experience to date with breakers is that it isn't a problem (as I said =
they employed a few)... and this time it was a problem.  Even me =
standing in VIP saw this circle as out of control... most of the floor =
stoped moving altogether to watch.   For all you guys know, Derrick or =
his road manager could have asked a bouncer to do something about it. =20

THINK.  WOULD YOU WANT TO BE JUDGED THE SAME WAY YOU HAVE JUDGED MODA?

  Forgiving is one thing.....enabling it to continue is another.  Should =
Skillz have to forgive Moda?---hell no!  Should people NOT let this =
incident be an excuse not to go there...perhaps.  Like Jamie did say, =
this incident was not in relation to Mythodic and Jess and they want to =
alleviate and even apologize for an incident that was not of there doing =
and props to them for stepping up and doing so (As well as trying to =
maintian a positive vibe). Should they be punished and their efforts go =
to waste?  No.  should people like Doug or Brad who played in addition =
to DC, lose support because the crowd doesn't want to deal with a staff =
like Moda's?  That would certainly be a shame, they deserve to be heard =
and in larger venues.=20
  =20
  However...what we're supposed to just forgive and bend over and take =
it?  Continue watch friends and relations take abuse they do not =
deserve...be it physical or verbal? (And both has occurred there to the =
most underserving of people) Especially after people spent their hard =
earned money to get in an establishment, then their hard earned money to =
drink/support otherwise only to be kicked out or watch friends be =
humiliated, belittled, etc... for no reason. =20
  =20
  There are many options....voicing your opinion is a big one.  It makes =
no sense for Moda to impose ridiculous punishments on it's patrons if =
the interest is keeping out riffraff.....They are making a common =
business mistake of not knowing or making any attempts to get to know =
their clientele.  If they don't respect the current crowd Ritual has =
brought in they are not going to HAVE a crowd...the money dropping W. =
6th trendsetters for the most part got bored and are gone, they're =
pissing off the heads/ravers etc.. with bad vibe, there just isn't much =
left....
  =20
  Also at the same time, I don't believe "Moda" has "asked" for =
forgiveness....Ritual and Mythodic did for something they didn't even =
do.  Honestly, Skillz got it right Fuck Moda.  Support =
Ritual/Mythodic/Jess as best you can though within keeping your system =
of values.  However, especially when there are tons of other clubs in =
Cleveland who have been doing things right, why should we have a pity =
party for Moda.  They (Other clubs--and) have many of the same =
pressures, but don't bend to them.  It'll be the day I see someone get =
kicked out of Touch or Abbasso for the same circumstances. =20
  Yeah we should be understanding of the pressures on clubs, but a club =
really should be much more respectful of it's patrons.  It is a =
business...and in any business, customers are your lifeblood. =20

  I can't really comment on the incident involving Skillz because I did =
not see it first-hand. I have heard several first-hand accounts, and I =
hope that both sides can forgive, forget, and move on. But it has me =

  I've noticed an increase in this kind of stuff overall in the past two =
years in all clubs across the country. It's not just Moda that seems to =
wield a heavy hand. I have witnessed similar incidents clubs in DC, =
Boston, New York City, Chicago and Miami, and have even been involved in =
them...They are not fun, and not something anyone wants. But it is, =
unfortunately, a price I think we have to pay to further our scene. =
Examples:

  Last year at the Conference, David was asked to leave a party simply =
for bending over to get a lighter out of his lower pocket and lighting =
someone else's cigarette. The bouncer *thought* there was contraband =
involved, and there was no "due process" for Dave to prove himself =
otherwise. The fact that David had nothing on him but a lighter and a =
pack of cigarettes didn't matter at that point. The bouncer caught =
something out of the corner of his eye and it was his word against =
David's. It's a private establishment, and you are there on their terms. =
They reserve the right to oust you if they for whatever reason feel you =
are breaking their rules.

  I've also seen friends have to leave Vinyl (ARC), and ARC probably one =
of the THE most friendly scenes in New York City. It's a CYA for the =
clubs to stay in business.

  I don't envy the position of clubs who are forced to play the =
middleman between law enforcement and party-goers, all the while =
maintaining the reputation of their club as appealing to both sides. =
Especially in today's hostile legal environment, and especially here in =
Cleveland where stories of fights, shootings, and even deaths in the =
Flats in recent years have caused officials to scrutinize security =
practices and have caused bouncers to throw around heavy hands. I =
remember many fights breaking out along W6th St. as I was flyering last =
Summer for the Summer Series. I'm sure the last thing Moda wants is that =
kind of crowd moving in. Do I agree with what they did in Skillz' case? =
No, because I know our community wouldn't intentionally try to rile up a =
club. but, can I understand why clubs have tough policies? Yes, I can =
see it. Sure the bouncer in particular may have been a royal jerk but is =
it reason to hate the whole institution?

  So, I guess what I'm saying is that like any good relationship, there =
is compromise and there has to be some understanding on behalf of both =
parties for the relationship to grow. Club owners and their individual =
employees need to see and understand that most "ravers" coming =
above-ground to dance and celebrate good music are generally going to be =
respectful of the ground rules they have to have to stay in business, =
and party-goers in turn need to realize that there are some things they =
need to sacrifice in order to continue to see talent brought to their =
cities. I guess in the spirit of MLK day today I'm thinking that the =
strongest form of protest is understanding.

  We can bitch about drink prices, doorp policies and so forth, but as =
someone said to me on Saturday night, "No place is perfect and we all =
can't have everything we want all the time." The utopia we all strive =
for is as ethereal as the ways we try to describe our joy in the music, =
and it is something we all have to work at. It does not get handed to =
us. Like any love affair, we have to be willing to forgive and move on =
if it is to last.

I moved from Seattle to Hudson, OH in 1990. I have absolutely no memory it
my zip code ever being 216 ... but perhaps that's because we used to not
have to dial the zip code before calling someone else in our own town
(like we do now) and I never noticed.

Dude, I always say zip code instead of area code. Must be because

Subject: {pb-cle} Ok my thoughts on Moda and the night in question

--0-1545978851-1074624199=:61724
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Ok let me begin by saying thank you for everyones thoughts and actions on the hole 
subject.  Its good to know that people even care what what happened to me.
As for the hole night and the fact that there are is a dj that does not like breakin to there 
his sets.  I got there early doug b was on and there was one was on the dance floor.  Stretched out and started practicing the same bouncers that gave me the boot where 
watching me and bobbing there stupid fucking heads.  So this went on for a little while and a couple people were watching and what do you know they started dancing as well.  At any point in that time those stupid fucks could of walked up to me and said some thing like this (Yo kid you are ghetto as hell if you do that again i will kick you in the chest and grab you by the neck and throw you out in front of about 150 of your friends).  At that point i would not have danced any more.
  That would have made sense to me  Hhmmmm......
So they said nothing to me and the night went on.  So the night went on people dancing bla bla bla some kid comes up to me and says (Hey Skillz there is a circle go bust it)  So i was on that shit!  Walked over threw down once then chated with holly threw down again talked to the girl who walked into the circle (ie the girl that might have been preserved as a girl they wish i kicked) was a girl that i just got her phone number to mac on saying she did not know i breakdanced.  No booty that night since i got the boot.
Went back a third time and the bouncer said and i quote (hey i do not like breakdancing) So i said let me throw down one more time and i will be done.   He looked at me right in the eye and nodded his head stepped back and watched me dance then throw down again go it to a wind mill then the rest was history.  
Am i in the right?  Am i in the  wrong?  Who cares.......  That was ignorant drama that did not need to happen in a break circle that i was in for about 41/2 minutes.
Did i like moda before that no.  I only went to because a bunch of friends were going.
I think they are over priced the club is small and looks like a NY gay club and there are always old dirty drunkin business tring to grind on young girls.
Hey throw them out.
So as for me i am never going back.  As for every on else If you never go again more power to you.  I am NOT asking any one to boycott the place.  I do know about 50 people that will never go back based on there own decisions because if that happened what are they going to to get there ass kicked for next week end.   
So i do not want this to turn out like (OH skillz is leading i strike!)  I am not going back thats my thoughts.
As for moda - FUCK moda    
As for they promoters its not your fault if you want to give my 20$ back that would help ease my pain.
As for doug b i break because i love to dance.  You did not look so bothered by me when i was the only person dancing to you set.  I have no beef with you lets not make tension between us because of a couple bouncers.]
Ok i have said enough.  Thank you again for every one that helped or called or stood up for me.  I love are scene just not moda
    SKILLZ

Have a few people passing around the petition at their next show.  I

Damn, I've been 216, 330, and 440.  And several times each(don't think I'm 
going to find my warm place in the sun in ohio).  Maybe I need to take some 
time off from moving.

I know I said I was done with this... and Doug, you
know I love ya man... but, you said:

<< That does not make it right but I am trying really
hard to figure 
out why the harsh reaction towards Moda on this
list... when there are 
promoters out there who ARE shadey, who rip people
off, who 
intentionaly rob kids of pharms and resell them, who
do all kinds of really wrong 
things.... but yet no one speaks up about them? >>

ahhh, but we DO!!! A recent example - 'the Hardman
incidents'

there are others... many is the time Prod. Co.'s have
been hammered on here for various things. 

And I have NO beef w/ Mythodic here, they have gone
above and beyond the call for apologizing and I
totally have faith they are working to solve the prob.
and I prop them up for that. At this point I would say
give moda another chance.

On behalf of the Security Officer, Management and General Staff of Moda, =
I
would like to apologize for the incident during the Derrick Carter
Performance.  Whereas, a patron was ejected for break-dancing.  Please =
be
assured that this type of action is not representational of our staff =
and we
cherish our customer base.     =20

            Please understand, that, more times than I would like to
disclose, people have been injured in and around the facility for a =
variety
of different reasons.  Also remember, we are responsible for the safety =
and
the security for those we service and do not take our jobs lightly.  It =
is
important to respect the personal space of others that are there to =
enjoy
the atmosphere, as it is important to enjoy the atmosphere itself.  =
However,
please do not allow this isolated event to reflect negatively on our
establishment and/or personnel. =20

=20

            We hope that many of you enjoyed Derrick's performance, as =
we
all did, and will continue to patronize our establishment to enjoy the
variety of acts being proposed for the months to come.  If I can be of =

No tension at all... but I want to get something straight...

BREAKDANCING DOES NOT BOTHER ME....

30 people stopping to watch one person dance bothers me.
Blocking traffic, making others feel uncomfortable bothers me.
Bumping into people bothers me.
Taking up space when others need it bothers me.

BREAKDANCING ITSELF IS *NOT* DISRESPECTFUL,  BUT THE PEOPLE GATHERING =
AROUND TO WATCH OFTEN ARE.=20

As a breakdancer, you can't control what others do and what crowds form =
around you... but you can be aware of it enough to end it when its out =
of control.  At Derick Carter, the circle that formed later got out of =
hand... 1/3-1/2 of that dancfloor just stopped and several people got =
pushed and bumped out of the way (who were trying to dance).   From what =
I know out of you... you are a very polite person and probably wouldn't =
want to see that happen. =20

But it does suck that the bouncer led you into a trap... that sucks.

By the way... I was really happy to see you out dancing to my set =
earlier... that's what got the floor going while everyone else was =
socializing and cocktailing.  I was gonna find you later and let you =
know (and I never did get to give you a propa apology for field day). =20

The bottom line is that no one should have an issue with how another =
person dances... but no one should be pushing people around on the =
dancefloor... conciously or not.

peace,
d

  As for doug b i break because i love to dance.  You did not look so =
bothered by me when i was the only person dancing to you set.  I have no =
beef with you lets not make tension between us because of a couple =

if i assaulted someone, i'd expect the possiblility of ending up in

if im not mistaken, 440 is on both sides of 216..  east and west? I know it

I knew what you meant, I was just referring the 330, and 440 rave scene
being treated as just one 216 cleveland scene earlier. But when I lived in
Elyria (or when i moved there) it was 440.. SO it's been 440 ever since Ive
ever been there =)

yes... everywhere used to be 216 at one time. =)

Come on guys! Let's not argue about this and let's all pass around my
magical blow pop around the circle. Maybe someone can give the bouncers a

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kent : weekend review

you're too gentle, it's all about the zip code rule, not the area code
rule... at least there are nicer cats out there than you that only live by
the time zone rule, and those guys have no game anyways so it's a moot
point.

I guess you could apply rules that are normally put on food to women as
well... like the new and improved "7 second rule"... if she's out of your
sight for 7 seconds it's fair to hit on another woman while you're out in a
social setting.... and if the woman is of morally casual nature, you might
be able to swing a nice BJ in the bathroom.

Ahh, the days of morally casual women...

If any of you guys are interested, i have a friend who's got a vinyl 
cutter. (Not a for making 12" records) If anyone wants to get some 
custom vinyl cutouts for your car window, you can get just about

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: State of the Regime Address

Highlights:

1) Edward Kennedy is the fucking man.  Every time the camera was on him
while Bush was talking, he was shaking his head in disbelief.

2) When bush mentioned that the patriot act would expire in a year, there
was applause from a group of democrats I am guessing.  Bush looked pissed.
That was outstanding.

3) When there was mention that a tax act they passed would expire as well,
there was applause, which bush tried to talk over and make it seem like
there wasnt dissention.

4) so many times when he said shit, it really looked like he was tongue in
cheek, literally.  Like when he was talking about social security and being
wise with the taxpayer's money.

5) when Bush was talking about immigration and a new program he wanted to
employ that farms out jobs to other countries when no americans could be
found to do the job, it really sounded like someone did the
*cough*bullshit*cough*...

6) He said that drug use in high schools has dropped 12% in 2 years.  That's
funny.

7) He wants to start a "Wank your Weiner" grassroots campaign to help lower
STD contractions of teenagers.  Well, he didnt call it that, but hey, plain
abstinence sounds lame.

Welp... it's 10, time for funk and soul night, bush can go hug a root.

Doug...I think this "harsh reaction" had a lot to do with than just merely this incident, they never had this "type" of incident, but so many people have their own personal story of being disrespected at moda, and when you pay to get that kind of treatment it just kinds of rubs one the wrong way (especially when it happens over and over and over again, no matter how much faith you put in an establishment that it will change)....
I don't think it was necessarily just this incident that has people upset, but it provided an opportunity to express upset over a lot of other things that have happened at the club.  This was not the only incident that has been an uncomfortable situation.  I myself...(and you know me!) was incredibly disrespected and humiliated by a coat check girl awhile in front of a long line of people, with a friend as well who will never set foot in the place again...and never really told anyone short of a few people, never posted it and created drama.  I did just as Amy suggested in another post....forgave and gave the club a second chance...many second chances.  Heck, I even posted stuff about this show trying to help promote.  And that's not the only incident I've been a part of or witnessed, and many others have similar stories. There's been numerous things such as bartenders being rude, double-charging, bouncers honestly being muscle-heads...flexing where there was no safety issue involved,
 and if there was a simple comment would have been enough.  Granted there are personality conflicts in any establishment but many of these were simply way out of line or totally uncalled for.  People in the service industry are totally allowed to have a bad day, it's understandable...we're human, but every day? And why should promoters/dj's have to pick up the slack for bad service...their job is promoting and playing music...not apologizing for thigns they didn't do and had no control over.  And if you look at other clubs/bars...the level of issues in proportion is exponential in comparison.  I will speak up that it is not all bartenders or bouncers @ Moda too...for example at DC, one bartender we had was an absolute sweetheart!  (tip the good ones well, it'll keep them there!!!!!)
And I do remember when a bouncer a long time ago had me take a drink off the second floor balcony, but he was very respectful about it and kind...he understood I didn't realize it was a safety issue, and since he wasn't a jerk about it I had no reason to argue or be an idiot back, I just took my drink off the shelf....is simple courtesy really so hard?  There really are some great staff members there, and it sucks that some of their co-workers give them all a bad name. 
 
I know I gave my two cents, because the "pot boiled over" so to speak.  I'm probably one of the most hopeful people when it comes to giving any show and any club and any promoter a chance...I just would like to somehow rationalize how to enjoy shows at Moda without having to watch myself or people I know be hurt needlessly and made to feel worthless or beneath contempt when we go simply to dance and enjoy the music.  Anyone who knows me should realize I'm not a fan of negativity...and act like such a darn "why can't we get along" kind of person.
 
Honestly, don't take my comment at least as trying to stir up drama....more it was a lot of pent up frustration and trying numerous times to reconcile what I believe is an appropriate behavior/vibe/value system whatever you want to call it, with Moda and figure out how the two mesh.  
 
Honestly, I would want to be judged the same way I judged moda...if I didn't think rationally and control my temper I would want someone to let me know, to complain, to let me know that what I did was unresonable, unecessary and hurt them.  If there was a more peaceful alternative solution I could have employed I would like someone to tell me, so I could use that method instead in the future.  
 
My post was not all about boycott Moda, and it was most definitely written to say don't let this incident stop people from supporting promoters, DJ's etc @ Moda...(support, support, and every time you go in make a point to tell Moda to THANK their promoters)! But honestly....really, what do you do when no matter how many times you forgive or try to not judge the same incidents keep popping up time and time again.   The question was asked how do you support the good without supporting the bad....that's all I want to know.

People everywhere have had problems with Bouncers/Security. In many different clubs and many different places. This is not a new problem to our scene. Do you peeps remember when some candy kids got beaten by the (was it cops or security) and sent to the hospital at the Cotton Club??? Many have had their fair share of issues with over zealous "security". That does not make it right but I am trying really hard to figure out why the harsh reaction towards Moda on this list... when there are promoters out there who ARE shadey, who rip people off, who intentionaly rob kids of pharms and resell them, who do all kinds of really wrong things.... but yet no one speaks up about them?

This issue with skillz should NOT have happened... we can all agree on that. Skillz definately has a right to hold a grudge against the club and I don't think anyone is arguing that. The promoters applogized, and as I said that is something most would have not taken the time to do. That's all on them... and it is between them.

The thing I want to point out is this: Everyone on this list has taken this discussion into their own hands and created a bit of drama out of it. Is it the club's responsibility to come on this newsgroup (one of about 10 of them out there) and apologise to this list (expecially the people not even in attendance who have jumped on the bandwagon and added their two cents.)? I don't understand why here on pb-cle-politics this is a huge topic of discussion, when it hardly gets mentioned elsewhere?

What I am saying is that this got blown into a whole big snowball of stupidity. Is it a requirement for Moda to know about this list and issue an appology to all of you? Should they put an ad in the plain dealer (would any of you even see it) to make sure they get everyone? Maybe rent a billboard (how many would they have to buy to make the point known)? Moda probably does owe skillz an apology... but what if they DO seek him out and appologize? Would he even bother to tell you guys that they DID? Would you even listen if he did? What about the people who read this initially... joined the bandwagon... said fuck you... and ignored any outcome? Would it undo the damage that has already been done by everyone who has added their opinion to the mix (including people have have never even set foot in the club? ?

In the end... you got to give people chances to learn from their mistakes or better themselves. I've made a lot of them and I try to always learn and always get better. But this list is acting like the sentence has been givinen over an incident that obviously should not have happened. These guys have never had this happen before... their experience to date with breakers is that it isn't a problem (as I said they employed a few)... and this time it was a problem. Even me standing in VIP saw this circle as out of control... most of the floor stoped moving altogether to watch. For all you guys know, Derrick or his road manager could have asked a bouncer to do something about it. 

THINK. WOULD YOU WANT TO BE JUDGED THE SAME WAY YOU HAVE JUDGED MODA?

Forgiving is one thing.....enabling it to continue is another. Should Skillz have to forgive Moda?---hell no! Should people NOT let this incident be an excuse not to go there...perhaps. Like Jamie did say, this incident was not in relation to Mythodic and Jess and they want to alleviate and even apologize for an incident that was not of there doing and props to them for stepping up and doing so (As well as trying to maintian a positive vibe). Should they be punished and their efforts go to waste? No. should people like Doug or Brad who played in addition to DC, lose support because the crowd doesn't want to deal with a staff like Moda's? That would certainly be a shame, they deserve to be heard and in larger venues. 

However...what we're supposed to just forgive and bend over and take it? Continue watch friends and relations take abuse they do not deserve...be it physical or verbal? (And both has occurred there to the most underserving of people) Especially after people spent their hard earned money to get in an establishment, then their hard earned money to drink/support otherwise only to be kicked out or watch friends be humiliated, belittled, etc... for no reason. 

There are many options....voicing your opinion is a big one. It makes no sense for Moda to impose ridiculous punishments on it's patrons if the interest is keeping out riffraff.....They are making a common business mistake of not knowing or making any attempts to get to know their clientele. If they don't respect the current crowd Ritual has brought in they are not going to HAVE a crowd...the money dropping W. 6th trendsetters for the most part got bored and are gone, they're pissing off the heads/ravers etc.. with bad vibe, there just isn't much left....

Also at the same time, I don't believe "Moda" has "asked" for forgiveness....Ritual and Mythodic did for something they didn't even do. Honestly, Skillz got it right Fuck Moda. Support Ritual/Mythodic/Jess as best you can though within keeping your system of values. However, especially when there are tons of other clubs in Cleveland who have been doing things right, why should we have a pity party for Moda. They (Other clubs--and) have many of the same pressures, but don't bend to them. It'll be the day I see someone get kicked out of Touch or Abbasso for the same circumstances. 
Yeah we should be understanding of the pressures on clubs, but a club really should be much more respectful of it's patrons. It is a business...and in any business, customers are your lifeblood.

I can't really comment on the incident involving Skillz because I did not see it first-hand. I have heard several first-hand accounts, and I hope that both sides can forgive, forget, and move on. But it has me thinking of some larger questions.

I've noticed an increase in this kind of stuff overall in the past two years in all clubs across the country. It's not just Moda that seems to wield a heavy hand. I have witnessed similar incidents clubs in DC, Boston, New York City, Chicago and Miami, and have even been involved in them...They are not fun, and not something anyone wants. But it is, unfortunately, a price I think we have to pay to further our scene. Examples:

Last year at the Conference, David was asked to leave a party simply for bending over to get a lighter out of his lower pocket and lighting someone else's cigarette. The bouncer *thought* there was contraband involved, and there was no "due process" for Dave to prove himself otherwise. The fact that David had nothing on him but a lighter and a pack of cigarettes didn't matter at that point. The bouncer caught something out of the corner of his eye and it was his word against David's. It's a private establishment, and you are there on their terms. They reserve the right to oust you if they for whatever reason feel you are breaking their rules.

I've also seen friends have to leave Vinyl (ARC), and ARC probably one of the THE most friendly scenes in New York City. It's a CYA for the clubs to stay in business.

I don't envy the position of clubs who are forced to play the middleman between law enforcement and party-goers, all the while maintaining the reputation of their club as appealing to both sides. Especially in today's hostile legal environment, and especially here in Cleveland where stories of fights, shootings, and even deaths in the Flats in recent years have caused officials to scrutinize security practices and have caused bouncers to throw around heavy hands. I remember many fights breaking out along W6th St. as I was flyering last Summer for the Summer Series. I'm sure the last thing Moda wants is that kind of crowd moving in. Do I agree with what they did in Skillz' case? No, because I know our community wouldn't intentionally try to rile up a club. but, can I understand why clubs have tough policies? Yes, I can see it. Sure the bouncer in particular may have been a royal jerk but is it reason to hate the whole institution?

So, I guess what I'm saying is that like any good relationship, there is compromise and there has to be some understanding on behalf of both parties for the relationship to grow. Club owners and their individual employees need to see and understand that most "ravers" coming above-ground to dance and celebrate good music are generally going to be respectful of the ground rules they have to have to stay in business, and party-goers in turn need to realize that there are some things they need to sacrifice in order to continue to see talent brought to their cities. I guess in the spirit of MLK day today I'm thinking that the strongest form of protest is understanding.

We can bitch about drink prices, doorp policies and so forth, but as someone said to me on Saturday night, "No place is perfect and we all can't have everything we want all the time." The utopia we all strive for is as ethereal as the ways we try to describe our joy in the music, and it is something we all have to work at. It does not get handed to us. Like any love affair, we have to be willing to forgive and move on if it is to last.

Subject: Re: Re: {pb-cle} derrick carter review

I totally understand your points, and they are all good ones.

I don't agree with the snowball effect we saw here... and in cases like
yours there is much more than one isolated incident.  Many do feel that Moda
needs to improve.  The reason I got so upset was because people who haven't
even been to the club are now talking about it due to things said here.

We all know Mythodic to be a reputable promoter, and my instinct tells me
that Mythodic can help change happen.  With regards to this one incident...
it happened and a change of some sort is now in effect. For the guys at
Moda, running a club has been a learning experience and Saturday's incident
was definately a new one for them.

I'm sure it is difficult to ignore your past treatments, but people are
trying to push Moda to move past the old days.  If there is a problem, and
it is brought to their attention they will either ignore it or fix it.  With
an outside promoter like Mythodic bringing them crowds, they will most
likely choose to fix it.  Does that mean you are going to feel better about
it right now... probably not.  But in fairness to Mythodic the new people
coming in to experience Moda for the first time have to make up their own
minds, right?   In the end... it is not Moda taking the hit, it is the
production company who gets punished and hurt.  Moda *IS* a dope spot...
probably the best club in the midwest... and that is hard point to argue.
It's not like they have been around for years and year... this is still a
new club to most people and should be a fresh start.

With regards to the judgement comment... I realize yours opinion was not
formed lightly.  However, our group as a whole made a snap judgement about
the venue regarding this one incident... there was no time given for
Management to look at the situation and decide what course of action was
right.  I was more upset that snap judgements were made by people who have
never even been there.

d



<<< Doug...I think this "harsh reaction" had a lot to do with than just
merely this incident, they never had this "type" of incident, but so many
people have their own personal story of being disrespected at moda, and when
you pay to get that kind of treatment it just kinds of rubs one the wrong
way (especially when it happens over and over and over again, no matter how
much faith you put in an establishment that it will change)....

I don't think it was necessarily just this incident that has people upset,
but it provided an opportunity to express upset over a lot of other things
that have happened at the club.  This was not the only incident that has
been an uncomfortable situation.  I myself...(and you know me!) was
incredibly disrespected and humiliated by a coat check girl awhile in front
of a long line of people, with a friend as well who will never set foot in
the place again...and never really told anyone short of a few people, never
posted it and created drama.  I did just as Amy suggested in another
post....forgave and gave the club a second chance...many second chances.
Heck, I even posted stuff about this show trying to help promote.  And
that's not the only incident I've been a part of or witnessed, and many
others have similar stories. There's been numerous things such as bartenders
being rude, double-charging, bouncers honestly being muscle-heads...flexing
where there was no safety issue  involved,
>  and if there was a simple comment would have been enough.  Granted there
are personality conflicts in any establishment but many of these were simply
way out of line or totally uncalled for.  People in the service industry are
totally allowed to have a bad day, it's understandable...we're human, but
every day? And why should promoters/dj's have to pick up the slack for bad
service...their job is promoting and playing music...not apologizing for
thigns they didn't do and had no control over.  And if you look at other
clubs/bars...the level of issues in proportion is exponential in comparison.
I will speak up that it is not all bartenders or bouncers @ Moda too...for
example at DC, one bartender we had was an absolute sweetheart!  (tip the
good ones well, it'll keep them there!!!!!)
> And I do remember when a bouncer a long time ago had me take a drink off
the second floor balcony, but he was very respectful about it and kind...he
understood I didn't realize it was a safety issue, and since he wasn't a
jerk about it I had no reason to argue or be an idiot back, I just took my
drink off the shelf....is simple courtesy really so hard?  There really are
some great staff members there, and it sucks that some of their co-workers
give them all a bad name.
>
> I know I gave my two cents, because the "pot boiled over" so to speak.
I'm probably one of the most hopeful people when it comes to giving any show
and any club and any promoter a chance...I just would like to somehow
rationalize how to enjoy shows at Moda without having to watch myself or
people I know be hurt needlessly and made to feel worthless or beneath
contempt when we go simply to dance and enjoy the music.  Anyone who knows
me should realize I'm not a fan of negativity...and act like such a darn
"why can't we get along" kind of person.
>
> Honestly, don't take my comment at least as trying to stir up
drama....more it was a lot of pent up frustration and trying numerous times
to reconcile what I believe is an appropriate behavior/vibe/value system
whatever you want to call it, with Moda and figure out how the two mesh.

method instead in the future.

when no matter how many times you forgive or try to not judge the same
incidents keep popping up time and time again.   The question was asked how
do you support the good without supporting the bad....that's all I want to
know.

them... and it is between them.

Is it the club's responsibility to come on this newsgroup (one of about 10
of them out there) and apologise to this list (expecially the people not
even in attendance who have jumped on the bandwagon and added their two
cents.)? I don't understand why here on pb-cle-politics this is a huge topic
of discussion, when it hardly gets mentioned elsewhere?
>
> What I am saying is that this got blown into a whole big snowball of
stupidity. Is it a requirement for Moda to know about this list and issue an
appology to all of you? Should they put an ad in the plain dealer (would any
of you even see it) to make sure they get everyone? Maybe rent a billboard
(how many would they have to buy to make the point known)? Moda probably
does owe skillz an apology... but what if they DO seek him out and
appologize? Would he even bother to tell you guys that they DID? Would you
even listen if he did? What about the people who read this initially...
joined the bandwagon... said fuck you... and ignored any outcome? Would it
undo the damage that has already been done by everyone who has added their
opinion to the mix (including people have have never even set foot in the

have never had this happen before... their experience to date with breakers
is that it isn't a problem (as I said they employed a few)... and this time
it was a problem. Even me standing in VIP saw this circle as out of
control... most of the floor stoped moving altogether to watch. For all you
guys know, Derrick or his road manager could have asked a bouncer to do
something about it.

Skillz have to forgive Moda?---hell no! Should people NOT let this incident
be an excuse not to go there...perhaps. Like Jamie did say, this incident
was not in relation to Mythodic and Jess and they want to alleviate and even
apologize for an incident that was not of there doing and props to them for
stepping up and doing so (As well as trying to maintian a positive vibe).
Should they be punished and their efforts go to waste? No. should people
like Doug or Brad who played in addition to DC, lose support because the
crowd doesn't want to deal with a staff like Moda's? That would certainly be
a shame, they deserve to be heard and in larger venues.
>
> However...what we're supposed to just forgive and bend over and take it?
Continue watch friends and relations take abuse they do not deserve...be it
physical or verbal? (And both has occurred there to the most underserving of
people) Especially after people spent their hard earned money to get in an
establishment, then their hard earned money to drink/support otherwise only
to be kicked out or watch friends be humiliated, belittled, etc... for no
reason.
>
> There are many options....voicing your opinion is a big one. It makes no
sense for Moda to impose ridiculous punishments on it's patrons if the
interest is keeping out riffraff.....They are making a common business
mistake of not knowing or making any attempts to get to know their
clientele. If they don't respect the current crowd Ritual has brought in
they are not going to HAVE a crowd...the money dropping W. 6th trendsetters
for the most part got bored and are gone, they're pissing off the
heads/ravers etc.. with bad vibe, there just isn't much left....
>
> Also at the same time, I don't believe "Moda" has "asked" for
forgiveness....Ritual and Mythodic did for something they didn't even do.
Honestly, Skillz got it right Fuck Moda. Support Ritual/Mythodic/Jess as
best you can though within keeping your system of values. However,
especially when there are tons of other clubs in Cleveland who have been
doing things right, why should we have a pity party for Moda. They (Other
clubs--and) have many of the same pressures, but don't bend to them. It'll
be the day I see someone get kicked out of Touch or Abbasso for the same
circumstances.
> Yeah we should be understanding of the pressures on clubs, but a club
really should be much more respectful of it's patrons. It is a
business...and in any business, customers are your lifeblood.

are not fun, and not something anyone wants. But it is, unfortunately, a
price I think we have to pay to further our scene. Examples:
>
> Last year at the Conference, David was asked to leave a party simply for
bending over to get a lighter out of his lower pocket and lighting someone
else's cigarette. The bouncer *thought* there was contraband involved, and
there was no "due process" for Dave to prove himself otherwise. The fact
that David had nothing on him but a lighter and a pack of cigarettes didn't
matter at that point. The bouncer caught something out of the corner of his
eye and it was his word against David's. It's a private establishment, and
you are there on their terms. They reserve the right to oust you if they for
whatever reason feel you are breaking their rules.
>
> I've also seen friends have to leave Vinyl (ARC), and ARC probably one of
the THE most friendly scenes in New York City. It's a CYA for the clubs to
stay in business.
>
> I don't envy the position of clubs who are forced to play the middleman
between law enforcement and party-goers, all the while maintaining the
reputation of their club as appealing to both sides. Especially in today's
hostile legal environment, and especially here in Cleveland where stories of
fights, shootings, and even deaths in the Flats in recent years have caused
officials to scrutinize security practices and have caused bouncers to throw
around heavy hands. I remember many fights breaking out along W6th St. as I
was flyering last Summer for the Summer Series. I'm sure the last thing Moda
wants is that kind of crowd moving in. Do I agree with what they did in
Skillz' case? No, because I know our community wouldn't intentionally try to
rile up a club. but, can I understand why clubs have tough policies? Yes, I
can see it. Sure the bouncer in particular may have been a royal jerk but is
it reason to hate the whole institution?
>
> So, I guess what I'm saying is that like any good relationship, there is
compromise and there has to be some understanding on behalf of both parties
for the relationship to grow. Club owners and their individual employees
need to see and understand that most "ravers" coming above-ground to dance
and celebrate good music are generally going to be respectful of the ground
rules they have to have to stay in business, and party-goers in turn need to
realize that there are some things they need to sacrifice in order to
continue to see talent brought to their cities. I guess in the spirit of MLK
day today I'm thinking that the strongest form of protest is understanding.
>
> We can bitch about drink prices, doorp policies and so forth, but as
someone said to me on Saturday night, "No place is perfect and we all can't
have everything we want all the time." The utopia we all strive for is as
ethereal as the ways we try to describe our joy in the music, and it is
something we all have to work at. It does not get handed to us. Like any
love affair, we have to be willing to forgive and move on if it is to last.

That's why I tried to differentiate between Moda and the promoters and also mention that it would not be fair to not support the promoters/Dj's etc(They deserve support)... my post was kind of more to question how to get Moda to enact change...(though looking back I think I was a little bitter~~positive person, but drama queen nonetheless)  
 
For anyone, here's what I was attempting to do in my post in a nutshell
 
1.  Somehow figure out how to bring it to Moda's attention/prioity to finally make some changes
2.  Get Moda to realize they need to listen to their promoters/clientele more (guess that goes with one)  No kidding Amy, they should listen to Mike/Mythodic...this was kind of my point with some sort of letter/petition...I want Moda to know many of us are there due to their promoters, and give their promoters the credit they deserve, as well as listen to what they have to say(It'll definitely improve business!). 
3. Get some sort of dicussion/answers how to reconcile many of our thoughts about the scene with the obvious disparity(is that the right word?) in regards to Moda's.
 
Basically I hate to see a great space go to waste, I hate to see promoters and DJ's who work hard get screwed, and I hate seeing myself and others waste money that should go elsewhere putting it into pockets of people who disrespect where that money is coming from...but at the same time I do want my money going to the promoters and DJ's.  I'd love to see some dialogue that might actually create some change.  
 
I hear you on the snowball effect, though at sometimes it seems unfortunate that only an explosion/controversy/or hitting rock bottom (something along the lines of this situation) can enact change, when numerous minor issues/complaints never seemed to.

I totally understand your points, and they are all good ones.

I don't agree with the snowball effect we saw here... and in cases like
yours there is much more than one isolated incident. Many do feel that Moda
needs to improve. The reason I got so upset was because people who haven't
even been to the club are now talking about it due to things said here.

We all know Mythodic to be a reputable promoter, and my instinct tells me
that Mythodic can help change happen. With regards to this one incident...
it happened and a change of some sort is now in effect. For the guys at
Moda, running a club has been a learning experience and Saturday's incident
was definately a new one for them.

I'm sure it is difficult to ignore your past treatments, but people are
trying to push Moda to move past the old days. If there is a problem, and
it is brought to their attention they will either ignore it or fix it. With
an outside promoter like Mythodic bringing them crowds, they will most
likely choose to fix it. Does that mean you are going to feel better about
it right now... probably not. But in fairness to Mythodic the new people
coming in to experience Moda for the first time have to make up their own
minds, right? In the end... it is not Moda taking the hit, it is the
production company who gets punished and hurt. Moda *IS* a dope spot...
probably the best club in the midwest... and that is hard point to argue.
It's not like they have been around for years and year... this is still a
new club to most people and should be a fresh start.

With regards to the judgement comment... I realize yours opinion was not
formed lightly. However, our group as a whole made a snap judgement about
the venue regarding this one incident... there was no time given for
Management to look at the situation and decide what course of action was
right. I was more upset that snap judgements were made by people who have
never even been there.

d



<<< Doug...I think this "harsh reaction" had a lot to do with than just
merely this incident, they never had this "type" of incident, but so many
people have their own personal story of being disrespected at moda, and when
you pay to get that kind of treatment it just kinds of rubs one the wrong
way (especially when it happens over and over and over again, no matter how
much faith you put in an establishment that it will change)....

I don't think it was necessarily just this incident that has people upset,
but it provided an opportunity to express upset over a lot of other things
that have happened at the club. This was not the only incident that has
been an uncomfortable situation. I myself...(and you know me!) was
incredibly disrespected and humiliated by a coat check girl awhile in front
of a long line of people, with a friend as well who will never set foot in
the place again...and never really told anyone short of a few people, never
posted it and created drama. I did just as Amy suggested in another
post....forgave and gave the club a second chance...many second chances.
Heck, I even posted stuff about this show trying to help promote. And
that's not the only incident I've been a part of or witnessed, and many
others have similar stories. There's been numerous things such as bartenders
being rude, double-charging, bouncers honestly being muscle-heads...flexing
where there was no safety issue involved,
> and if there was a simple comment would have been enough. Granted there
are personality conflicts in any establishment but many of these were simply
way out of line or totally uncalled for. People in the service industry are
totally allowed to have a bad day, it's understandable...we're human, but
every day? And why should promoters/dj's have to pick up the slack for bad
service...their job is promoting and playing music...not apologizing for
thigns they didn't do and had no control over. And if you look at other
clubs/bars...the level of issues in proportion is exponential in comparison.
I will speak up that it is not all bartenders or bouncers @ Moda too...for
example at DC, one bartender we had was an absolute sweetheart! (tip the
good ones well, it'll keep them there!!!!!)
> And I do remember when a bouncer a long time ago had me take a drink off
the second floor balcony, but he was very respectful about it and kind...he
understood I didn't realize it was a safety issue, and since he wasn't a
jerk about it I had no reason to argue or be an idiot back, I just took my
drink off the shelf....is simple courtesy really so hard? There really are
some great staff members there, and it sucks that some of their co-workers
give them all a bad name.
>
> I know I gave my two cents, because the "pot boiled over" so to speak.
I'm probably one of the most hopeful people when it comes to giving any show
and any club and any promoter a chance...I just would like to somehow
rationalize how to enjoy shows at Moda without having to watch myself or
people I know be hurt needlessly and made to feel worthless or beneath
contempt when we go simply to dance and enjoy the music. Anyone who knows
me should realize I'm not a fan of negativity...and act like such a darn
"why can't we get along" kind of person.
>
> Honestly, don't take my comment at least as trying to stir up
drama....more it was a lot of pent up frustration and trying numerous times
to reconcile what I believe is an appropriate behavior/vibe/value system
whatever you want to call it, with Moda and figure out how the two mesh.
>
> Honestly, I would want to be judged the same way I judged moda...if I
didn't think rationally and control my temper I would want someone to let me
know, to complain, to let me know that what I did was unresonable,
unecessary and hurt them. If there was a more peaceful alternative solution
I could have employed I would like someone to tell me, so I could use that
method instead in the future.
>
> My post was not all about boycott Moda, and it was most definitely written
to say don't let this incident stop people from supporting promoters, DJ's
etc @ Moda...(support, support, and every time you go in make a point to
tell Moda to THANK their promoters)! But honestly....really, what do you do
when no matter how many times you forgive or try to not judge the same
incidents keep popping up time and time again. The question was asked how
do you support the good without supporting the bad....that's all I want to
know.

them... and it is between them.

Is it the club's responsibility to come on this newsgroup (one of about 10
of them out there) and apologise to this list (expecially the people not
even in attendance who have jumped on the bandwagon and added their two
cents.)? I don't understand why here on pb-cle-politics this is a huge topic
of discussion, when it hardly gets mentioned elsewhere?
>
> What I am saying is that this got blown into a whole big snowball of
stupidity. Is it a requirement for Moda to know about this list and issue an
appology to all of you? Should they put an ad in the plain dealer (would any
of you even see it) to make sure they get everyone? Maybe rent a billboard
(how many would they have to buy to make the point known)? Moda probably
does owe skillz an apology... but what if they DO seek him out and
appologize? Would he even bother to tell you guys that they DID? Would you
even listen if he did? What about the people who read this initially...
joined the bandwagon... said fuck you... and ignored any outcome? Would it
undo the damage that has already been done by everyone who has added their
opinion to the mix (including people have have never even set foot in the
club? ?

have never had this happen before... their experience to date with breakers
is that it isn't a problem (as I said they employed a few)... and this time
it was a problem. Even me standing in VIP saw this circle as out of
control... most of the floor stoped moving altogether to watch. For all you
guys know, Derrick or his road manager could have asked a bouncer to do
something about it.

was not in relation to Mythodic and Jess and they want to alleviate and even
apologize for an incident that was not of there doing and props to them for
stepping up and doing so (As well as trying to maintian a positive vibe).
Should they be punished and their efforts go to waste? No. should people
like Doug or Brad who played in addition to DC, lose support because the
crowd doesn't want to deal with a staff like Moda's? That would certainly be
a shame, they deserve to be heard and in larger venues.

Continue watch friends and relations take abuse they do not deserve...be it
physical or verbal? (And both has occurred there to the most underserving of
people) Especially after people spent their hard earned money to get in an
establishment, then their hard earned money to drink/support otherwise only
to be kicked out or watch friends be humiliated, belittled, etc... for no
reason.
>
> There are many options....voicing your opinion is a big one. It makes no
sense for Moda to impose ridiculous punishments on it's patrons if the
interest is keeping out riffraff.....They are making a common business
mistake of not knowing or making any attempts to get to know their
clientele. If they don't respect the current crowd Ritual has brought in
they are not going to HAVE a crowd...the money dropping W. 6th trendsetters
for the most part got bored and are gone, they're pissing off the
heads/ravers etc.. with bad vibe, there just isn't much left....
>
> Also at the same time, I don't believe "Moda" has "asked" for
forgiveness....Ritual and Mythodic did for something they didn't even do.
Honestly, Skillz got it right Fuck Moda. Support Ritual/Mythodic/Jess as
best you can though within keeping your system of values. However,
especially when there are tons of other clubs in Cleveland who have been
doing things right, why should we have a pity party for Moda. They (Other
clubs--and) have many of the same pressures, but don't bend to them. It'll
be the day I see someone get kicked out of Touch or Abbasso for the same
circumstances.

really should be much more respectful of it's patrons. It is a
business...and in any business, customers are your lifeblood.

bending over to get a lighter out of his lower pocket and lighting someone
else's cigarette. The bouncer *thought* there was contraband involved, and
there was no "due process" for Dave to prove himself otherwise. The fact
that David had nothing on him but a lighter and a pack of cigarettes didn't
matter at that point. The bouncer caught something out of the corner of his
eye and it was his word against David's. It's a private establishment, and
you are there on their terms. They reserve the right to oust you if they for
whatever reason feel you are breaking their rules.

between law enforcement and party-goers, all the while maintaining the
reputation of their club as appealing to both sides. Especially in today's
hostile legal environment, and especially here in Cleveland where stories of
fights, shootings, and even deaths in the Flats in recent years have caused
officials to scrutinize security practices and have caused bouncers to throw
around heavy hands. I remember many fights breaking out along W6th St. as I
was flyering last Summer for the Summer Series. I'm sure the last thing Moda
wants is that kind of crowd moving in. Do I agree with what they did in
Skillz' case? No, because I know our community wouldn't intentionally try to
rile up a club. but, can I understand why clubs have tough policies? Yes, I
can see it. Sure the bouncer in particular may have been a royal jerk but is
it reason to hate the whole institution?

compromise and there has to be some understanding on behalf of both parties
for the relationship to grow. Club owners and their individual employees
need to see and understand that most "ravers" coming above-ground to dance
and celebrate good music are generally going to be respectful of the ground
rules they have to have to stay in business, and party-goers in turn need to
realize that there are some things they need to sacrifice in order to
continue to see talent brought to their cities. I guess in the spirit of MLK
day today I'm thinking that the strongest form of protest is understanding.

something we all have to work at. It does not get handed to us. Like any

Subject: {pb-cle} my reaction to the derrick carter weekend

i know i'm a little late in the discussion and i'm not
going to get on the 'bandwagon' as pointed out by
doug, mainly because even though i was at the event on
saturday, i didn't see the incident with skillz.
however, i will say that of course at a place like
moda, you can't really expect the club security to be
cool with breakers taking up the dance floor. moda is
obviously one of the more trendy and 'clubby' clubs in
cleveland and does not care that a bunch of party kids
or even club kids like to dance the way they dance. i
feel bad for skillz and damion and also to my girl
lindz who got called a bitch, that would have pissed
me off so bad! ha!  but ... on a more positive note,
two girl bartenders hooked me up with a birthday shot
for free. and of course, derrick was off the HOOOOOOK
in cleveland and in columbus. also, he did one of the
best things for me. while talking to him after his set
on saturday, i asked him if he had the track, 'mind
over matter: different shapes and sizes' which some of
you might remember as being an old skool tune on many
mixtapes back in the day. it is one of my favorite
tracks and he said he had it with him. SO, when i
heard him bring that track in the next night in
columbus, i was sooooo excited. i ran up on stage and
danced for about 45 minutes (birthday drink in hand
;)). he kissed my cheek and said happy bday later that
night too! what more could i ask for? one of my
favorite djs playing my favorite tune on my birthday
weekend. dope, very dope.

oh, and not to mention thanks to lindz for a great
birthday and it was great to see everyone up in
cleveland again. i think it's a positive thing that
ritual is doing, but maybe how bout they move their
ritual events to metropolis or something, where you
know breakers won't get kicked out?? i always had a
good time on sundays there. especially when there was
dnb in the back room ;)

remember, listen for the bassline !!! our mag is
coming out soon and it's not too late to advertise!!
so hit us up,
contactbassline@hotmail.com
we need your support!!!
peace,
steph c.

well, he only mentioned the first patriot act, not the second one that was

$10 for aaron alone though? when we had him here in 00 it was $10 
for him and every other breakcore artist in the midwest. i wonder 
if he's all rockstar now. he slept in my mom's basement for a week

As an opposing point of view why would you not want to hear the addresses or
the agenda? Doesn't seem logical.

Err...I _THINK_ he was asking if the expiration of the PATRIOT act was the true statement.

No one questioned the "tasteless" act of the "traitorous liberal scum".

Oh, I dunno. Perhaps he wasn't in the mood for a comedy last night.

Wait....Logical? LOGICAL?

Our "fearless leader" just proposed billions in new programs, farming out jobs to immigrants while
the unemployment rate is the highest it's been in over a decade, and continues to support tax cuts
for the wealthiest citizens and corporate entities in this country and you're talking about LOGIC?

ROFLAO thanks for that. That was good. 

I was just saying that it was unnecessary, unusual, and tasteless to
interrupt a speech, in such a negative manner regardless of who was
speaking. It did make me laugh though. They where given the rebuttal right
after the speech. 

Bush did seem off his game though compared to the last several SOTU
speeches. Fumbled over some parts where you could tell the intent was to
build up energy and really stick a point home. 

As far as the rebuttal...
Maybe it was just me but that chicks face was seriously creeping me out. It

The crap about the sacred marriage stuff was just stupid. I can't believe
people are so preoccupied with caring about who people choose to spend their
lives with.

I was talking about tom's logic.

Yes the "amnesty" even though he proclaims its not. Is a joke and very
disturbing. 

Tax cuts worked(short term anyways) and have nothing to do with
unemployment. In fact tax cuts for "wealthiest citizens and corporate
entities" is what will allow these "bastards" to employ more people. My
company employed 4 extra employees as a direct result of these tax cuts. I
am far from wealthy but I definitely enjoyed the tax breaks that a got this
year especially the marriage cut and the child cut. If by wealthiest you
mean employed and working then our definitions are different. :)

Its to bad Lieberman isn't even trying I would have a hard time picking
between him in bush on the ballot.

<<In fact tax cuts for "wealthiest citizens and corporate entities" is what will allow these

Hey, I realize that conservatives are necessary. Lord knows I'm not going to make a good living
working for my liberal friends. I just don't have to like the fact that my employers OWN my
legislators. (Speaking hypothetically, of course.)

<<My company employed 4 extra employees as a direct result of these tax cuts.>>

And what happens when George pushes through the overtime cuts? I have a sneaking suspicion that's
going to do something detrimental to that hiring jump.

Hence the issue that led to the debacle of 2000. He's barely a democrat to begin with...I'm thinking

We are pee'ing our pants because dean seems to be doing so well :)
OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, NEW YORK, NEW MEXICO, <insert primal whop and holler
here> ... think he had a map? ;)

Then bush goes and does the same stupid ass map reading for supporting
countries. DOHT didn't you see dean make an ass out of himself.

I can't remember the last time a candidate from either party got me excited.
Everyone is such extremist on both sides. Everyone catering to there special
interest groups as well and the financial backers. Not to mention the
constant fighting between them. Issues don't even seem to matter just
fighting over who's ideology is right.

When was the last time we had a united congress, senate, president on an
issue that didn't involve revenge or war.

I am bored can anyone tell.

um, the tax cuts worked to do what, exactly? job creation is way 
way way behind the number of losses since bush took office. most 
of the change in the unemployment # is due to people giving up 
their job searches. read pretty much any commentary on the issue 
by any economist who isnt a bush mouthpiece. shit, look at what 
greenspan had to say about the cuts initially.

lieberman is a republican.

i dont have any links, but if you read the paper daily youd know 
all about this.

and i guess you havent been following the polls in NH eh? dean is 
staying steady while clark and kerry are quickly catching up. at 
this point, id say momentum is in the favofr of kerry and edwards. 
and dean has been making a point that its because of his influence 
that more of the candidates have been critical of bush, and i 
think thats true. it does (as pointed out by 
www.talkingpointsmemo.com [which im reading a nice interview with 
george soros on right now]) marginalize his whole campaign thus 
far. i was into dean, but as of right now im cool with all 4 front 
runners. theyre not perfect but theyre not bush or lieberman. i 
doubt dean can pull it off at this point though. it seems like his 
support has plateaued.

um, thats the point of not having a dictatorship or a single party

Ya but constant deadlock can get old also. How many issues don't even get

i wouldnt say theres constant deadlock. the fact is that most 
moderate measures get passed. theres gonna be deadlock on either 
side's most radical views until one side gets enough support that 
they have a vast majority needed to pass. this is actually what 
has happened in the past 2 years since the repubs cleaned up in 
02. and they were too arrogant, they took things too far without 
doing enough for the everyday person. this is why once there is a 
democratic candidate, i think that bush will have a hard time. i 
was reading somewhere yesterday that bush's disapproval rating in 
an ABC poll was up from 33% a few months ago to 45% now, even 
after the capture of saddam.

I didnt see a post about this, so here it is -

I am going to be playing at fuze tonight @ the bbt (I am pretty sure!).
Free wings, fries, etc.. always a good time. I think its free now too,
except you have the option to "Donate" a few bucks.

I am not sure who else is playing. but it should be fun!  If you are in
the burgh come out and rock out. I should have some copies of my latest cd
to give out, just ask me for one.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FWD: NEW RELEASES FOR 21 JANUARY 2004

"7 Speed Deraileurs"

Should have been added into the database by today...

Haven't seen chord control in there yet, but I am assured that it is.

Do a search for Rudiman, they should both come up.

If you still have issues (other than mental) let me know and I'll put them 
on hold.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} Iron Mixit

Up yonder in the Pacific Northwest, there's a bit of a "Laptop Battle"
phenomenon happening. Seattle vs. Portland has become as brutal as it is
exciting. Psh! I say that sounds pretty boring. Just LOTS of folks looking
like they're checking their email.

The subject came up on an electronic music co-op I'm a part of, and I think
it sucks, but is not without potential. I instantly thought of folks like
Ming + FS instead of the traditional laptop head bobbers (although, I'm a
self admitted LHB).

So, here's my post to the co-op, slightly edited, comments in brackets.

--begin post--
I just posted a comment about something like this at the end of mlbot's blog
on laptop battles, and I'm half interested if any people in the ohio/midwest
area would be interested in my idea. It's Iron Chef meets the Mixit.[a
montly self generated mixit contest we have]

Two teams of two people go head to head. They're given the same items: an
acoustic instrument, some sort of synth, another type of sample source (a
record perhaps), and a toy. [say a bass, a sesame street record, and a
speaknspell. Another note: I want all my stuff back in one piece. Circut
bending is prohibited unless otherwise noted.]

The two teams have 45 minutes to make the most of their music utilizing
whatever tools they have been given or have brought, but they will
inevitably be judged on how they made the best use of what they were
presented with as the Iron Instruments.

To complete the entertainment, I say bring on a panel full of
commentators/judges, have brief bios of the contestants, etc.

Purists may call it whorish, I call it having fun with something I love to
do.
--end post--

So the end goal at the end of 45 minutes is to make a live set about that
long.

Thoughts? Challengers?

- Mike

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Iron Mixit

I'd be on a team if anyone else wanted to do it.  It seems like just 
about the only sport in the world that I would have a chance in 
winning.   Personally I think the team should include a camera man as 
most of the hijinx that I'm involved with includes that these days.

A Bently Bomb.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies
(these are moving into the ROM itself)

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Cold Crush Brothers:

  The Cold Crush Brothers is one of the most influential hip-hop groups 
of all times, renowned for their stage stomping performances and funky 
melodies. The Cold Crush Brothers have set the standards for hip-hop to 
come. Cold Crush Brothers appeared in the first hip-hop movie Wild Style. 
Wild Style which was released in the early 80's, featured graffiti, break 
dancing and the art of MC'ing and DJ'ing on film. The Cold Crush Brothers 
have appeared on singles with blastmaster KRS-ONE, Chuck D, of the world 
acclaimed Public Enemy, and Doug E Fresh, the World's Greatest 
Entertainer. The Cold Crush Brothers is known for its epic battles with 
Fantastic Five Mcee's in the world Famous Harlem World Entertainment 
Complex in the 80's. The Cold Crush Brothers was the first hip-hop group 
to rock stages abroad, taking their high energy stage show to Japan in the 
middle 80's. The Cold Crush Brothers original line up consisted of DJ 
Charlie Chase, DJ Tony Tone, The Cold Crush four Mcee's, Easy A.D, 
Almighty Kay Gee, Grandmaster Caz, and JDL. The Cold Crush Brother's 
strong rhymes and melodies show that the Cold Crush Brothers are the 
Rolling Stones of the hip-hop culture.

Dj Tony Tone:

    One of the most highly respected figures from the old skool era talks 
to Fatt JointZ exclusively about back in the day. DJ Tony Tone can be seen 
in the motion picture Wildstyle which was a movie made in the early 80's 
about the Hip Hop culture in New York City. Amongst the pioneers like 
Grand Master Flash, DJ Kool Herc, Bam and DST Tony Tone explains to us 
what was really going on and expresses some of his deep feelings towards 
the state of Hip Hop today. Tony Tone is the man who was behind the 
formation of the original Cold Crush Brothers. He recruited the great 
Grandmaster Caz, EZ-AD and other members to form this powerful group.

Fri Feb 27                      THIRD EYE V3                      Cleveland

[my unofficial birthday party!]

Friday, Feb 27 2004
The Third Eye V.3
Cleveland, Oh

The Goahead Productions Third Eye series continues. With this edition
we revisit the dark and lovely aspects of techno and psytrance.


Lori the Hifi Princess – Psytech – Austria

International DJ Hi-Fi Princess, aka Lori Ward, has been establishing
herself in the underground party scene since 1993.

Having taken part in the ever-changing music scene throughout Europe
(England, Belgium, Germany, Macedonia, Slovenia, Austria, Spain, Croatia,
and Finland) Hi- Fi Princess's sound has evolved into a sophisticated mix
of techno and psychedelic music. She has spun with some of the biggest
names in techno/psy trance (Hallucinogen, Orion, Chris Liberator, Mark
E.G., G-force, Chris Liebing, Oscar Mulero, Futureshock, W.J Henze,
Franchesco Farfa, and Renato Cohen). She has also played at some of the
best clubs and festivals in the world.  (Tunnel-MYC, Liquid Club-Madrid,
Koneisto Festival-Finland, The Best-Zagreb, Ambasada Gavioli-Slovenia,
Mazzo-Amsterdam, Sona-Montreal Canada, Turbo-Toronto Canada, 1015
Folsom-San Francisco. Club Kuaille-Tokyo, Japan.Cittadella, Brno-
Czech.Stereodrome, Bratislava-Slovakia.Fever-Vienna.Nuke Festival-
Zwentendorf.Suncity, Graz)

Lori had her first release on Shimmy Recordings out of Bristol, U.K. Her
track, Refused Entry, was released June 12, 2000 on the Collective
Thoughts EP.  This E.P had great reviews in Wax, Out of Hand, Mixer
Magazine, and by some of the top DJs in the business.

http://www.sistersf.com/guestDJs/hifiprincess.php

Sequential Tom - www.futuretechartists.com/tom.html – U.S.A

'Sequential' Tom's involvement with electronic dance music began in the
early '90s when he moved to Amsterdam. His first experience at a 'house
party' pretty much charted the course of events: he started spending every
free minute in the record shops; he sold his electric guitar for a
Juno-106. Staying five years in Amsterdam, Tom relentlessly absorbed the
dance culture and eventually picked up the DJing habit and some production
experience.  In early '97 he packed his vinyl and headed back to New York
City, with an interest in bringing the european underground trance sound
to the States.  He landed a job at NYC's famous Throb records, where he
met members of the notorious Polymorphous crew. They began organizing
parties together, and Tom soon became a regular sight behind the decks on
Friday nights at the legendary club Vinyl, where he enjoyed a residency
with Polymorphous. During his tenure there he played alongside many great
acts from the trance scene. He's delivered on many of NYC's finest
dancefloors, at clubs like Vinyl, Speeed, Cream, Anseo, etc., and at
numerous parties. No stranger to airports, he's also played all over the
U.S. and Canada, in western and eastern Europe, and in Japan and Asia.  
Although Tom raised eyebrows and caught ears as an innovative, technical,
and cheeky DJ on the U.S. trance scene, his taste in DJing has since gone
in a more techno-oriented direction. His eclectic background still comes
through in his sets, but it is undeniably techno at the essence of every
moment.  Multifaceted, the man also works as a graphic artist and web
hack.  Accordingly his interest in the visual arts is developed, and is
seen to hold relation to all his musical endeavors.

....CHILD OF GAIA.... 

Your soul is lush and exploding with life.  Children of Gaia are driven to
sustain themselves and those around them with love.  Equipped with a
methodical and humanitarian heart you can accomplish any task and glean
the best results from it.

Being so attached to “your view” of nature and order can cause you to
create your own reality.  As a member of the cosmic race who makes worlds
real, it is good to believe in a greater plan beyond your own.  Stay aware
of your weakness.

Going with your heart is the key in this existence. You will always be
doing the right thing if you are being natural. Remember, you have
everything you will ever need at all times.  You are a physical expression
of the divine.

Mickey started DJing in the late eighties and became well known with the

early nineties breakbeat and loose jungle techno was filling his record 
boxes as he travelled the length and breadth oh the UK. Such was the 
demand for his skills at this time by huge events all around the country 
he was even strarting to catch private planes between gigs. Mickey's 
production talents started off with Biting Back - She's Breaking Up then 
partnered Gavin and Claudio for Urban Shakedown - Some Justice. Now in the 
late nineties Mickey travels the world and throws down his vibe in 
countries like Japan, USA, Australia, Holland, Ibiza, Germany, Finland, 
Israel and France to name just a few.
Being at the helm of the UK drum and bass phenomenon means his record bags 
are full of the most upfront dubplates and latest releases from producers 
all around the world.

-Dioptrics w/ Ariel - DnB - DC area - www.focalpoint.to

It was 1997 when Ariel was exposed to Jungle/Drum n' Bass and the 
Minneapolis rave scene. 3D, Snuggles, Danny tha Wildchild, Slack, and 
Casper just name a few, were DJs out of the Chicago scene that influenced 
Ariel into DJing himself. He was officially hooked on the musical style 
known as Jungle/Drum n' Bass.
His sets vary from Progressive, to Ragga, to Hard, to Experimental and 
everything in between, always with some exclusive material of his own and 
always trying to keep his listeners on their toes. Recently he has been 
premiering numerous tracks of his on dub plates and will very soon play 
only on dub plates.
Though exposed to varied degrees of academic electronic music in school, 
Ariel's passion for Drum and Bass has landed him a permanent home in his 
studio where he spends a majority of his time. His style of production 
displays many influences such as UFO!, Aphex Twin, Goldie, Facs, and Klute 
just to name a few. Although writing within the structure of the DnB 
style, Ariel's concept of sound, color, timbre, and form are greatly 
derived from art/academic music. In writing Drum and Bass he is trying to 
achieve an equal blend of urban and artistic sounds, while keeping the 
listener in suspense and of course MOVING!!!


-Soniq Stylz - hard house/breaks - dayton - www.focalpoint.to

For the past eight years, Tim Hayes aka DJ Soniq Stylz has been honing his 
skills in the mid-west club scene, searching for the right combination of 
genres. Finding it in nu-skool breaks and hard house, Soniq is one to look 
for in the future. With several club residencies and main events under his 
belt, he has toured with the likes of Jesse Saunders, Delta 9, DJ Irene, 
DJ Rip, and DJ Kos Soniq also ran his own club night (called Activ8) and a 
series of after parties, featuring the likes of Titonton Duvante, DJ Rip, 
Diggabeats, Tilzs, Tronic, and Kid Entropy. Soniq is now taking his lively 
sets to the nationwide masses, in places like Detriot, Seattle, Texas and 
Chicago. Tim also dabbles in music production under the moniker Flogged 
Dolphin, knocking out local club favorites "Feel The Power", "Weapons", 
and "Bump". Having recently dropped "Just The Messenger", a double CD 
release, he is getting ready to add two new mixes, "Housewrecka v. 4" and 
"Disc Breaks".


-React - techno - cincy/chicago - www.subsonik.com / www.focalpoint.to

React is the driving force behind Subsonik Productions, a crew that has 
brought world class talent and high quality events to Ohio since 1998. 
Also one of the regions leading techno DJ's, his style varies from thought 
provoking minimal techno, to sophisticated tech-house, to floor driving 
techno. React's mixing style and technique is just as eclectic as his 
sound, and ranges from smooth and progressive in nature to a more Detroit 
influenced style of turntablism (tricks, cutting, backspins, etc). React 
has rocked a large number of clubs and parties, with numerous appearances 
in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Columbus, Dayton, his home town of 
Cincinnati, and others. React is currently focusing on 3 turntable mastery 
and 2 x 4 sets with other techno DJ's, in addition to building a studio to 
produce music.


-Mowgli - DnB - cincy - www.focalpoint.to

In over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and Jungle,

knowledge and attitude. As of recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing 
drums and sampling loops. He has equipped artists such as 
A-Sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheads), Dylan & Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), 
MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with these drum breaks. Be sure to 
check out his event CHILLED, every Tuesday at the Bamboo Club in Newport,

-Infinite Grey - cincy - house (live Pa) – www.focalpoint.to, 
www.linenoiz.com

John's technique to live performance is different from many live PA's. It 
includes live recording and manipulation of sequences and does not involve 
a computer or master sequencer. Instead, he uses separate sequencers to 
control each instrument (sampler, synthesizer, drum machine) 
independently, which allows for a degree of live improvisation. Because he 
produces and remixes material live, every performance is a unique 
experience. Over the past 3 years John has played at some of the largest 
parties and clubs around Ohio.

existence. As a Producer and Sound Designer, Kenya nurtures the
elements of ambience and atmosphere in his compositions with a diverse
catalogue of tones, frequencies and exploited daydreamed sounds. A mood
provoking and unique mixture of ambient textures and minimal beats
compliments his cerebral style of composing. Often inspired by the
overture of silence, Kenya expresses musically his vision of artistic
storytelling. Founder of Adore Recordings and Distorted Grooves and half
of the epiphanic collaborative, Popularity Contest Committee, Kenya
DuBois is an Ambassador of the atmospheric state of mind.

-Oompaloompa - trance - cincy - Airplane Clique/ GSP Entertainment

Joshua Perry aka Oompa Loompa, has been a recognized force in the Midwest 
for nearly 3 years now. The Epic/Anthem/Hard Trance style Oompa Loompa 
brings to the tables have provided the masses of the mid-west with lasting 
memories of an epic journey worthy of Willy Wonka himself.

of Trance's fastest rising stars, Joshua has begun working on his 3rd 
release "Gobstoppers" which will include his original track I'm your dj

-CatNap - triphop/ jazz - columbus - mechaproductions

Starting his dj career in 1996 with hiphop and IDM shows on WKCO 91.9fm,
Catnap held residencies from New York City to London UK in the late 90's,
and has made his mark on Ohio's rave and club scenes since moving to
Columbus in 2000. He is known for a style that is very eclectic but always
a mix of gritty breakbeats, retro sounds, and jazzy textures. His newest
DJ mix, "Rendez-Vous", mixes instrumental hiphop with jazz, lounge, and
world music in the same vein as Mark Farina's "Mushroom Jazz" series.
Original tracks by Catnap will also be featured on GrooveReactor Records'
upcoming compilation, to be released in January.


-Phrenzy - DnB -rokitlabs.com - djphrenzy.com / www.GrooveReactor.com

Steve Gillson exited the womb wearing a set of Sennheisers, but it wasn't 
until late 1996 that he discovered his alter ego, DJ Phrenzy. After 
quickly adapting his musical knowledge to the art of performance, he 
garnered several residencies in Southern Ohio and joined forces with 
Groove Reactor Records. Since then Phrenzy has been lurking in the shadows 
of the midwest, making rare public appearances alongside the likes of 
Dieselboy to Darude. Phrenzy steps to the decks with a unique blend of 
harmonic euphony and technical precision that always moves the crowd. 
Don't miss this opportunity to witness a musical purist in action.


- Robotnik - jungle/ragga - Steel Arm Records - Kokomo, IN

An old Jungle soldier in the Ragga trenches since late 94, Robotnik was 
brought up on a steady diet of beats from such old skoolers as UFO!, 3D, 
and R.A.W. this newly revitalized Ragga Mercenary turned DJ will step to 
the decks for his premier after giving up his dues and working it to the 
fullest to fuse the new rising Ragga sound with the old dark hard Jungle 
of yesteryear gone by. This soldier will kill heads and murder a 
soundsystem all while smoking a spliff he probably found in one of his 
nappy dreads. Ragga Not Dead!


-ADubzz - turntableism - cincy - www.basisproductions.com

With his superb scratching skillz mixed with the best ol' school and 
recent hip-hop and DnB tracks, Adam's calm demeanor is not to be mistaken

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

Cycle World International Motorcycle Show in Ohio

You are right, it is being held at the IX Center Jan. 30-Feb.1st. Adult
admission is $11, and child admission is $5. The shows hours are as
follows... friday 4pm-9pm, saturday 9am-9pm, and sunday 9:30am-5pm. If you
have any more questions, you can visit our website at
www.motorcycleshows.com

=========================================================================

I wanted to give the list a heads up on an event I and a number of other
people are through in April 23rd through 25th.  It's called Notacon and
the purpose is to explore technology, art, music and hopefully find some
synergy between them.  This is not party, not a rave nor is it a hacker
convetion, computer convetion or anything else of the sort.  However, it
may have elements of all of these and more.

We're currently seeking artists, performers and DJs who do unusual and
groundbreaking work to showcase their talent and art for our event.  We're
also inviting interested parties to attend the event.

For more information, including our call for proposals, please check out
our webpage:

Yeah count me in for the Leeds show for sure.

Anybody want to put me up for a night in the O-I-O? (That is Ohio for you 
vowel-handicaps)

What a horrible night to have a curse.

I might be able to hook you up with a place to
stay at my crib.  I'll be out for the Leeds show
as well.  You've gotta share the living room
space with Uncle Luke Duke though. :]

WERD. Now that we've put the record label on firm ground and have caught our breath from working all the time, it's going to be great to get everyone together again and have some fun! 

I'm really excited to have Austin here. If you look at his tour dates on his site, he plays all over the world, and U.S. appearances are rare. Vibe on it while you can! :)

My birthday was the 13th, fortunately no one here really mentioned it.  
Although I went out with some people that day and they wanted to take me 
somewhere where they like to humiliate you or sing or whatever, good thing we 
just went to chipotle and they don't do any of the stuff.  mmm.... 
buritos......

about 8-9 years ago, I was constantly hanging out with

nobody's business. I hardly ever drink, but when I do
I'm a tequila man myself.

*My* idea was to take you to that nudie bar where they'd have you get up
on stage and crawl after some naked ass on your hands and knees with
another chick sitting on your back, while the announcer made fun of you.
But in the end, Chipotle really was better. =)

Subject: {pb-cle} Attn: Tonite

as Most may know I play along w/ Bonita DLP on thursdays at KARMA niteclub 
in the powerhouse in the flats.
and unforunately business has not been the best

So miss Bonita got it in her head that we should have a contest to see who 
can get the most friends to show up

I know many of you would be at ABBASSO tonite, as would I if I weren't 
working

But it would be really kewl if atleast at some point throughout the nite you 
guys would stop by and just say hi
I don;t care if you run back to the abbasso or not
I am offering to the driver your first drink on me,
No I am NOT encouraging drinking and driving
this is just to help offset the cost off parking which is only $3 until 11pm 
and then it is free
and you can actually find parking on the ST. btu will have to walk a bit to 
get to the door

for those that don;t know how to get to the powerhouse
http://www.nauticaflats.com/nt-map.htm

I assure you this is a really nice club and completely worth the trip
plus you might aswell figure out where it is now cuz soon it will be the 
place you will want to be
esp w/ the new SUNday nite events and the BEST HOUSE DJ(the one we all know 
and love) in cleveland on saturdays

So again it would be really kewl to see all the kewl kats in cleveland out !

Subject: {pb-cle} OMG!  Mike Rowe (Soft) = ExtremeRaver.com

Holy shizzles!

Has anyone been following the story of Mike Rowe and Microsoft recently???

I was checkin out his site today (MikeRoweSoft.com), and clicked on his 
portfolio just to se what his stuff looked like, and saw this!

Site Name: Extreme Raver 	
Created:	November/2002	
Website:	http://www.extremeraver.com	
Extra Info: 	This is my personal webstore. I set up everything including 
the php code. I have recently started advertising the site using many 
methods.


And a quick google found this, from the pb-cle archives:

Hey Guys,

If anyone wants something that's a little cheaper , Peabody's is reviving their DJ Battles - starting Saturday night.. Same deal as the old battles, except this time I believe they are giving away tables and a mixer (not sure what kind).. 

I will be up there with a bunch of people and then we may head over to Abasso - we shall see!

Have fun @ Third Eye everyone!
~ Roxy

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Peabody's in Cleveland Saturday Night

LOL -- That's funny they are giving decks away...When we helped them with the Hybrid show, they didn't even have decks there 30 minutes before opening and we had to call a friend to bring down a mixer, then when they finally arrived, they gave us couch cushions to put decks on ... Maybe they should keep the decks for themselves!

Thanks Jwan - you killed it last night.
Has anyone heard from Curt yet?  Saying it looked like he enjoyed himself 
last night is an understatement.
Good times.
Thanks.

UK Government Advisor Says E Is 'Relatively Safe'

Leading British scientist Professor David Nutt believes ecstasy is =
'unquestionably non addictive, and appears to be "relatively safe in the =
short term," the Guardian reported this week, in an article examining =
the declining use of the drug in the UK.

"In fact, though the authorities prefer not to make the comparison, =
roughly 20 deaths a year ranks ecstasy alongside electric blankets in a =
list of Britain's biggest killers," the Guardian added.

However, the article coincided with a Mixmag feature predicting 80 =
ecstasy related fatalities in the UK this year, which they linked to =
people taking increasing quantities of pills, poly-drug use and =
different pills being sold as Es.

"Tablets containing compounds like PMA are especially worrying," UK =
expert Dr Fabrizio Schifano warned.

"MDMA (ecstasy) is toxic, but not greatly so. With PMA it's possible to =
overdose on just three or four pills."

http://www.derrycity.gov.uk/Press%20Releases/150903-blanket.htm =
(Electric blanket testing; 'Each year in the UK electric blankets cause =
between 800 and 1000 fires, with approximately 20 deaths and 200 =
injuries . . .')

Jwan introduced me to this restaurant "Johnny Mangos World Cafe" on a
Cleveland trip in 2002 and I love it!  Just wondering if anyone would want
to grab something eat there before the rave, if so let me know.  I will
eat there by myself if I have to :)  I just can't pass up a trip there
while in Cleveland.

Luke, trout, anyone?

Everyone is always on peobodies over these battles. It gives people a chance
to get heard on an ok system in front of a crowd. Who care if the "battle"
is about tickets.

I remember my favorite thing... the hot indian girl with the short hair was
dancing with 3 guys all who wanted her but were shy...  curt just goes right
up and uses his back to shield 2 of the guys and pretty much made the 3rd
guy stop dancing... that girl was lovin the attention... i was cracking up
cause it was not just a cock block, but a three-cock block.  then he didnt
even talk to her.  hey, if they can't take a joke, fuck them.

Welp, I haven't heard from John (Product 19) yet - I
left a message for him earlier today and it's 5.30 now
- the plan is he's supposed to meet at our place and
work on some stuff before we head over there tonight.
I really hope he can make it and that he can get here
soon - the weather could stand to be a lil' more
favorable right now though. If anyone has heard from
him at all and knows anything, please let me know so I
can plan accordingly - I'll try to give him another
call here and see if I get him. Thankya kind fokes out
there and better see yer all's ass out tonight!!
Cheers
Sherry

There's a good Vietnamese restaurant on Detroit Ave west of W25th, somewhere
around 68th, I think...Thinking about grabbing some spring rolls there this
weekend, prolly before we head over to Moda on Saturday. If anyone's
interested in a pre-game there on Saturday, holla!

Shit.

Kerem - I did not call YOU an idiot.

I called ME an idiot for spinning un-original progressive house.

I like to make fun of myself.

Wow that looked bad...

I apologize for any misunderstandings!


What a horrible night to have a curse.

Yeah same here, had to leave before andy james came on, but I did play his cd 
in the car though :)

Nice that the roads cleared up later in the night and more people showed up.  
Ton of people there that I knew.

I do want to freaking punch whoever's in charge of that construction down 
there if you kept making right turns from detroit supperior there was a road 
closed and a detour sign pointing down this little hill.  OK, went down there 
and there was a freaking gate down there.  only about a 20 ft hill and took 
me a good 10-15 mins and the smell of a lot of burnt rubber till I was able 
to get out.  freaking assholes.  That was the worst part of the drive, roads 
were manageable till just before I got to the i 90 exit where a truck 
jacknifed over the guard rail and down this little hill.

And for those that care, work SUCKS today, a lot of idiots with problems.  as 
of writing there are 20 calls that I have to do and I'm out of here at 
6:00 :-/

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Goahead thanks!

I had a blast and was there from start to finish, minus having left in the
middle of the night to visit shitropolis. Craze and Armanni ripped it up
there (and John Doe and Mo Pacino in the side room), but I came back in time
to see Andy let loose.

Nice night, though exhausting...

Thanks Luke for bringing me out and the rest of the crew there! The setup
was really nice and moose had the sound setup nice as well.  It was a good
time! It was nice to meet Jamie, Damon + Valerie of the Abbasso crew, and
of course seeing everyone else, boompsie, meghan, trout's crew, alex, etc.
I know I met some new heads as well.  Sorry I couldn't stay too long, I
drove back last night and I needed to be somewhat alert given the weather
etc. (2 large mcdonalds cappucinos wreaked havoc on my stomach, but gave
me the caffeine i needed :).

it does matter about "tickets"... i feel you on the aspect of a basement dj

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} How was Micro?

It was a fantastic night! David (aka Deviant) crushed it with an amazing set
until 1am. The crowd's response was overwhelming! He kept it very deep, very
trippy, very driving, very dark -- just awesome!

Shout outs to the pb-cle folks who represented! The whole crowd was good, I
thought. The joyous positivity of everyone there was noticeable. I met some
really amazing people! Everyone was really nice, really into it, courteous,
having fun! The night started out as a room of random strangers, and
everyone walked out as friends. It was fantastic the way I saw people
introducing themselves to each other, exchanging smiles...the VIBE was
everywhere!

There was some issue I guess with glowsticks being banned at one point in
the night, but I'm not sure what that was about, or if they really are
banned because at the end of the night from about 2am to 3am, I saw some
people with glowsticks to the left of the booth dancing with them for a long
time, right in front of a bouncer. I'm wondering if the issue was that
they're not allowed on strings? The dance floor was pretty packed so that
may have been the case. But I definitely know that people were dancing with
them at the end of the night with no problem.

Subject: {pb-cle} Moda/Micro last night

Thanks to all the crew who came out to support. It meant a lot to me to
know you were out there. I know that you're as happy as I am to spread
the sound that we've all been rocking at Abbasso for so long now. 

And it was good to see so many people hearing the progressive sound for
the first time and really enjoying it. I didn't know what to expect, and
the crowd response was overwhelming. It proved that you don't have to
sell out and play mainstream stuff to get the Moda crowd going like some
headliners in the past have resorted to.
 
I met a lot of new, wonderful people who were really into the music. I
have a renewed optimism about Cleveland's dance music scene. I hope to
see you all out again soon, not just at Moda, but at Abbasso too, which
has championed this sound from day one. Austin Leeds, February 6, be
there! 

Thanks to Michael from Mythodic for giving me the chance to rock it out
for four hours. Mike and I have been talking about working together
since I was still in NYC, and it was great that it finally happened. You
are truly in it for the music, not the money, just like it was when this
scene was born. A lot of the new-jack promoters today should take note. 

Finally, thanks to Amy, my partner in crime. Her passion for the music
helped get dance music in Cleveland rolling again, and her hard work
behind the scenes made all this possible. She busts her butt to spread
the music and love, so respect! 
Thanks again to everyone for a fun night.

Subject: {pb-cle} Weekend review (Third Eye, Micro, Abbasso for Featherwate)

--0-1368240940-1075056153=:54646
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Since I do not have the time to reply to everything here's the whole weekend in one for me. 
 
Friday got to Third Eye despite the horrendous weather. (Thank you Jamie!)  Ratana was throwing (Or should I say smoothly dropping) some laid back Dnb with a bit of reggae flavor.  Things were laid back and chill, and it gave a nice opportunity to kick back and talk with some people.  Boompsie arrived in full bo peep attire ; ) and then built up the energy.  Titonton then threw a surprisingly laid back chill set with a bit of groove. And Andy closed out the night by proceeding to rock the house...def. check out his recorded set--I can't wait to hear it.  I especially loved looking over at Linz at one point during Andy's set and the look on her face was priceless, def. into the vibe. As always, Third Eye always has the good people. Only Third Eye can make that many people brave those elements. 
 
Saturday hit Abbasso for pre-party, headed to a birthday party briefly and then made it over to Moda.  Definitely a bit of a change of vibe there than last week (for the better).  They staffed upstairs at least with some of the best bartenders, the bouncers kind of hung in the background, and there will still ravers on the floor early in the night.  Deviant's dark prog really works well in that space and was a pleasure to hear. He did a great job of building up his set.  Props to Mike and Jess and Scott.  I was quite pleased to hear Scott is working with Mythodic now as well.  They set an excellent vibe, and go out of their way to make sure people have a good time~~Thanks!  As far as Micro, the trance was older, and Epic as could be.  Personally, I miss and enjoy that kind of thing though.  He had energy, and the mixing was decent to good.  Quite a bit of cheering, hand clapping, and people otherwise reveleing in the sound. Def. give Moda a second chance to all who were thinking
 otherwise. 
 
Got to Abbasso before last call and was pleased to see Misterbradley P behind the decks (Sorry to hear Mike Donovan had a bout' with the flu)  and as always Brad was just making the dance floor bounce.  ALWAYs a treat.  And then Jason proceeded to get behind the decks and TEAR stuff up.  TEAR TEAR TEAR! stuff up.  One of the *best* house sets I've heard.  I know I left at about 4 and the dance floor was still rocking quite a bit.  It was great to see a sizable crew out to support this as well. As always, Abbasso def. did not dissapoint. : )
 
Overall, great weekend

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} download clients?

I'm all about poisoned on the Mac. It polls about every network except for
slsk.

Seriously though, these things suck. (yes, macs, but I mean p2p). They're
only good for porn. I never get more than dialup speed on the downstream and
a I'll be lucky if it's the full file, something off a mix cd, a crappy bit
rate, or not even the thing I was led to beleive I was downloading.

I'd pay big money for digital downloads of the music I actually listen to,
but it's not going to happen. I mean, I was the one asking you for a few
tips on ripping about X hundred records I've yet to touch. I just want some
of this crap on my ipod damnit. Warp kinda has it going on right now with
all that, I'd love to see it extended elsewhere without ultra restrictive
DRM.

RAWR!

- Mike

If you are looking for dance music, soul seek is the one.  
www.slsknet.org  It has been down most of the day though.  I use Kazaa 
lite as well but the only place I know of to dl the client is on the 
Kazaa network itself.

addymac is my slsk screen name btw.

Subject: {pb-cle} weekend in review

third eye was pretty fun. surprised to see product 19 made it out
fucking hardcore, rode a greyhound up and got a taxi from the bus station.
i dunno how bad clevelands bus terminal is, but if its ANYTHING like 
youngstowns, john is a very brave person.
anyhow, really dug the music for the most part, had a great buzz going 
thanks to bills ghetto 151 vodka (or pauls sleeping medicine, don't ever 
let paul mix you a drink, damn!)... had a fucked up buzzkill at the end 
of the night....  someone needs to be castrated.....
anyhow pix from 3rd eye:  http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/thirdeye_2

---------------

micro at moda......  our plan was to go check out deviant and split 
after laughing at micro fuck up his first few mixes... anyhow, we get 
there and chill out and start talking to everyone and run around. after 
a bit we see glowsticks and alot of ravers taking over the dance floor. 
hmmmm, wonder how this is gonna go, we later hear glowsticks are being 
confiscated. hmmmmmmm.... thats no good.  not sure what was the dealie 
there, but we didn't see any more after a bit... we did see some 
breakers later on in the night, they had a small circle and it went on 
for 15-20 mins until we split.  anyhow micro didn't wreck any mixes, and 
played some okay pussy trance, seemed dated, but hard to tell with that 
stuff since the genre hasn't really evolved since 2000 or so....  seemed 
to be less thuggy bouncers and more bartenders, yay!
went to abbasso to catch the featherwate thing.  house house house.... 
i've had enough house lately.... blah.  sometimes i hear some i can deal 
with, but i wasn't feeling it by this point.  wish there were more 
people there, those guys did drive up from columbus, but they didn't 
really promote it too well and were going against micro.... started to 
fill out afterhours though....

I'm all about poisoned on the Mac. It polls about every network except for
slsk.

Seriously though, these things suck. (yes, macs, but I mean p2p). They're
only good for porn. I never get more than dialup speed on the downstream and
a I'll be lucky if it's the full file, something off a mix cd, a crappy bit
rate, or not even the thing I was led to beleive I was downloading.

I'd pay big money for digital downloads of the music I actually listen to,
but it's not going to happen. I mean, I was the one asking you for a few
tips on ripping about X hundred records I've yet to touch. I just want some
of this crap on my ipod damnit. Warp kinda has it going on right now with
all that, I'd love to see it extended elsewhere without ultra restrictive
DRM.

RAWR!

glowstick on strings should never be used anywhere unless there's alot 
of room.  too many clumsy ravers let em rip and they go flying. i got 
hit by a set once and stuck em down my pants and told the clumsy raver 
they could get em if they wanted....  unfortunately they do look cool, 
but you really gotta have some room to play with em and most parties or 
clubs don't have that kinda room. i guess if you have the back part of a 
warehouse to yourself, have at it.....  (warehouse, whats that?)

Yeah Paul, if everyone didn't know before, they do now, paul had to be 
convinced for 30 minutes to buy the repress of inner city's "big fun" 
for $6.99.  Haha. He did buy it though!

Btw paul,  transmat is repressing most of the catalogue so you will be 
able to get the aril brikha album.

3rd eye was cool if not all that crowded...freakin'
weather...I enjoyed my self as usual (although I ran
out of beer again...i need to come more prepared).

Saturday...Deviant's set at Moda sounded incredible on
that system...it's well worth the trip to hear him on
the Nexo.  Micro was Micro...a lot better than he was
at funky buddha a few years ago, but limited by the
genre he plays.  The crowd was definately into it,
though...some folks obviously still dig epic trance.

Abbasso...It's too bad mike donovan couldn't make it
up...hope he's feelin' better.  Brad did well in his
place, and Jason Lyman Rocked It...Awesome set up
there with the best house sets I've heard.  If you
don't have his CD, go find a copy or download it from
featherwate.

Yes I now own Big Fun.

I think it is overrated the way you guys talk about it.

The chords fucking own but the melody really bothers me.


The search is stunted at this point.. I am very broke. I just need to find 
that niche that suits me...

Damn straight I had to be convinced...!

Its a fun dance record but... I dunno.

It was presented to me as a novelty and thats kind of why I bought it. I 
didn't buy it because I thought it was the greatest track ever... no 
offense.

To me it represents dance music at that time and the chords are catchy.

Like I just said to Tom...that melody REALLY bothers me... and not only 
that, it sticks in my head like a meat cleaver.

Not a fan of those vocals either but...those are more a matter of context. 
They're not too bad I guess, but... ;p

Give me all the shit you want.. :]

>to get the aril brikha album.


Good good. I need to sit down and listen to that album again.

Its tough for me to find a lot of techno records that "hits closest to the 
mark" (because, I think, unless you produce music and it turns out exactly 
how you want it to, not many records will hit the bullseye on a very 
personal musical dartboard) when it comes to what I would pay money for, and 
its hard for me to explain what exactly will "pass the test" without 
sounding too general...

What a horrible night to have a curse.

For dance music, Soulseek.  The server is regularly down, the client lacks
some nice features (like multi-source downloads), but the userbase is far
stronger than any other p2p for electronic dance.

A bunch of people are camping on old soulseek domain names, such as
www.soulseek.org.  You're looking for www.slsknet.org.  The only site of
theirs that hasn't crashed at one point or another is
http://slsk.blogspot.com.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Weekend review (Third Eye, Micro,
      Abbasso for Featherwate)

Thank you Luke for a great party!!  Ratana did a
very nice Drum n Bass set.  John and Sherry did
a very nice Acid Techno set.  I wasn’t too
impressed with Titonton.  I couldn’t wait to
hear Andy spin, and of course when he did, he
was off the hook!!  He never disappoints.

I was supposed to go to Moda and Abbasso on
Saturday, but didn’t make it out.  I even had
two comp passes and VIP wrist bands for Moda.  I
just got a new bed on Friday and I was sleeping
in it practically all day Saturday.  It’s the
most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in.  I set
my alarm for 9:30pm that night so I could get up
and get ready to go out, but my body just did
not want to move.

oh boy i don't recall the name of it, it was by those promoters that 
brought delta nine there to the agoro, not sure if it was that party or 
another one they threw. names eluding me.  blah.  wish we had a video 
clip of that shit though!
i do remember you being all sly sneaking into the breaker circle.....  
you should have been at moda for micro, there were about 5-6 dancers to 
micros pussy trance stuff.....   we were going to leave for abbasso, but 
kept getting sidetracked talking. when we were positively! going! to! 
leave!, we saw the breaker circle starting so had to stick around to see 
security's reaction to it.  a few looked and that was that. they were 
right up front and to the side of the dj booth.  they werent very good 
from what i saw, but que cera cera.....

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} download clients?

I fucking hate Apple. I love OS X. But I hate Apple. 

The screen on my powerbook is fine. The bezel is cracked and the cable
that powers the backlight needs replaced. 

Total Cost: $1400 (it keeps going up!)

They won't replace the bezel and cord, just the entire case
top/lid/screen assembly. After inspection of the broken parts, it's an
obvious design flaw... there's a very small piece of titanium holding in
the hinge for the screen -- it's like the metal is putty to boot.
Titanium my ass. So this weekend I head up to microcenter to see the new
Aluminum PB's. Hmm. Piano hinged. Will they fix their design flaw for
me? No. Steve Jobs = FIRED!

What really was the kicker for me is that Reaktor sucks a fat one on OS
X as compared to a PC, even with the Apple/IBM Altivec optimizations. I
can chain 8+ instruments and effects on a 1.6Ghz centrino, but I can run
one effect at 22000hz on my 867Mhz G4. I can't even render one track
with Live and a Reaktor VST for say, compression without spiking my CPU
and rendering total silence. When I had my 850Mhz Athlon, I was getting
double the performance or more than my 800Mhz TiBook in Live when
playing lots of clips. 

It's BS, and I'm going to find a class action suit to join in on. One of
the MANY brought against apple recently for their crap hardware and
empty promises. Either that or I'll take them to small claims myself. 

Love the software, hate the hardware. Hate the company more. I'm now
stuck unable to afford to fix this thing, and I have all this
specialized apple hardware sitting around. 

Hey, at least they're not microsoft.

Sold off a long time ago. It was kind of a rediculous investment, and
was more an effort of good faith. If I remember correctly, it was an
investment of like $125M, which even at the time was a rediculous amount
of money considering Apple had more cash (read as it is, they had more
CASH) than microsoft at the time. 

I'm not sure of the timing of the sell-off, but you could be right.

Subject: {pb-cle} Break-Dancers Perform for the Pope    

Break-Dancers Perform for the Pope
2 hours, 18 minutes ago

VATICAN CITY - In an unusual spectacle at the Vatican (news - web sites),
Pope John Paul (news - web sites) II presided over a performance of
break-dancers who leaped, flipped and spun their bodies to beats from a
tinny boom box.



The 83-year-old pontiff seemed to approve, waving his hand after each
dancer completed a move, then applauding for the entire group. He watched
the performance Sunday from a raised throne.


"For this creative hard work I bless you from my heart," he said.


During the show, one dancer — part of a Polish group that helps poor and
marginalized youths — planted his head on the inlaid marble floor of the
Vatican hall and spun to loud applause from his group and from Vatican
officials. Another performer flung his body around in a series of spins
and handstands.


"Artistic talent is a gift from God and whoever discovers it in himself
has a certain obligation: to know that he cannot waste this talent, but
must develop it," John Paul said.


Earlier Sunday, members of an Italian Catholic youth organization
enthusiastically cheered the pope's weekly remarks in St. Peter's Square.
A few were invited into his papal apartment and helped him release doves
from his window.


The pope, who suffers numerous ailments but appeared relatively strong
Sunday, called out to the other children cheering below his window.


"I love you all. I love you very much," he said.

Blue Spectral Hand
I Dissolve in order to Know
Releasing Healing
I seal the Store of Accomplishment
With the Spectral tone of Liberation
I am guided by my own power doubled

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: apple

i think its more of a ploy so they can say to the justice department, 
look we're helping apple, they're our competition, we're not a 
monopoly.....  they really NEED apple around.  linux they DON"T WANT 
around.  hahahaha......
one i do wonder about is they supposedly bought SCO licenses, what for, 
or how many?  gotta wonder.
anyhow did MS sell off that stock? i didn't read about that, figured 
that would be big tech news. and christ that money was pocket change to 
MS.

>paul.  what are you talking about.  you loved your set on saturday.

whatever!

There was nothing about my set that I reget, doing or not doing.

Maybe that part where I threw coffee all over Kerem's equipment.

I had some extra time towards the end. if I brought "BIG FUN!" with me I 
might have tossed it on for kicks.

...but if I had the Breakfast Club soundtrack the entire night may have 
ended up with me getting every guy who was listening with that special girl 
a prom date.

..I could have been an unsung hero.

Sometimes you just need to grab your $6.99 by the balls and squeeze till it 
bleeds.


>will you quit being a pussy already :)

you're a dong, don't give me your shit!! ;]

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} NRR: apple

SCO sucks ass. One of the servers I administer is a SCO open server. It is
by far the most troublesome and irritating to work with. My M$ 2000 and 2003
servers are even better, although my Linux servers are by far the best and
most dependable to work with.

Mac is kicking ass (I just bought my first mac a dual 1.8 g5 4 days ago)
because it has a better gui then windows and is built right on top of
various different parts of NetBSD. Best of both worlds. Now if I could just
figure out where my fucking right mouse button went I would be in good
shape.

Business wise Apple is not much better if not worse the M$. There
architecture is even more closed and more proprietary. They may be the
underdog but if the trend switched the same arguments against M$ would apply
to apple, however at least from my 4 days of experience the product is far
superior.

Yeah I actually followed this discussion over to the DOA board, which I
pretty much never read, and someone brought up the point that playing out
cdrs and mp3s of shit you aren't authorized to is pretty much the same
thing as stealing dubs.  It's not physical theft, but the end result is
the same, possessing shit you aren't supposed to have, with the difference
that dubplates wear out, and digital files never do.

Final Scratch and CDrs, gotta love em.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} BUSTED!!!!

I've played tunes on cdr, but only from the source itself. There's only been
2 times where I've played a tune that was handed down from me by a 2nd
person, in which I still get kinda sketchy on playing. But in all honesty I
see way to many heads playing tunes they've downloaded and didn't get
permission for it, from the gate. I could go on and on and on and on and on
with this subject till my head turns blue, but it still won't stop anyone
from doing it.

How does one steal tunes from slsk?  You've *really* got me curious there.
I think stealing a record outta someone's crate and playing an MP3 you
picked up online are two different worlds...

refrain:

"giving a woman a foot massage and eating out her holiest of holys 
ain't even the same ballpark."

I almost always have at least one cd player while I'm playing, to 
limit what I play to only the things in my crate is whack.  But to 
play cdr's of shit that is readily available on vinyl is also 
whack.  Here are the 3 crack commandments I live by when dealing 
with CDR's:

CDR's that I will play out:
1) Hotness that isn't being repressed and I can't find a copy of 
after looking for a sufficient time (or new shit i've ordered but 
havent received yet).  Fuck it, if I like a tune and I can't get 
it, I'm still gonna play it.
2) My own joints.
3) Tracks from other remixers that have given me permission to 
play their remix (even though I'm sure they really didnt get 
permission to remix it anyways, so it's like 3rd party piracy?)

Where not talking about Mainstream stuff. The idea that they're music is
getting heard should be a big deal. Not to mention if the track is hot what
dj isn't going to go buy it for 9 bucks. I don't rank dj's with the same
rank and file of teenagers ripping up kazaa. You may disagree but the dj is
the voice for the producer. Without them they are silenced. Not to condone
it but lets be honest its easier to download 200 tracks listen and play with
them in your mixes @ home or testing it in front of a crowd. Then you buy
the gems or your favs.

How do you know it wasn't put there deliberately by a producer to gain 
himself more coverage?

I would expect more responsibility to be put on to those who have initial 
control over the file in the first place, who would presumably have at least 
some control over whether it is shared or not...

What a horrible night to have a curse.

im actually arguing with some cat on freak and ak1200 on that

dont want to think about WHY someone might want to do these kind

I was closing yesterday at work... again... anyway I got out at around 10:15 
and I spent a half hour waiting for my car to melt and to loosen up the gate 
so I could close it since the keypad was frozen over (just threw some salt on 
it and that seemed to work).  main roads were fine by then, took me 5 or 6 
tries to get in the driveway though :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} BUSTED!!!!

I tend to waver on the issue, but then again, I'm not gaining financially from any of my production
work, so I can't speak to the situation guys like Dara and other professionals are in.

I look at it this way...in the situation I'm in at the moment, if you want to play my tracks out,
fuckin' bonus for me. I would, as I'm sure any amateur would, like to know that someone is playing
my tunes...not necessarily asking permission per se, but just "hey man, i dig your shit, i'm gonna
drop this in my set if it's cool by you."

I think this situation that Jea speaks of is something pretty well relegated to the junglist
community,  where there's a lot of cred and focus placed on the dubplate, the newest of the new, the
most limited of limited. In that scenario, you can see how this sort of thing can become a "natural
progression"...when you foster (intentionally or unintentionally) a spirit of "I've got it, you
don't, therefore I'm the hot shit and you're the old and busted", it's not hard to forsee this sort
of thing happening. Um...need i remind anyone that there's a track called "Dubplate Pressure".....

I've heard of peolpe's records being stolen on numerous occasions, of DJ's of any variety, to be
sure. But I can see how it would be  amplified in the sort of community where shit is rare/one of a
kind.

I almost always have at least one cd player while I'm playing, to
limit what I play to only the things in my crate is whack.  But to
play cdr's of shit that is readily available on vinyl is also
whack.  Here are the 3 crack commandments I live by when dealing
with CDR's:

CDR's that I will play out:
1) Hotness that isn't being repressed and I can't find a copy of
after looking for a sufficient time (or new shit i've ordered but
havent received yet).  Fuck it, if I like a tune and I can't get
it, I'm still gonna play it.
2) My own joints.
3) Tracks from other remixers that have given me permission to
play their remix (even though I'm sure they really didnt get
permission to remix it anyways, so it's like 3rd party piracy?)

Sent that one in a hurry; misspoke, so I'll rephrase, and shit.

Seems that if someone has a private copy of some vinyl, making an MP3 is a
good idea for a backup, but a really bad idea to put on Soulseek...  For
the most part, CDR ain't a bad way to go, but it's a bad way to get vinyl
that wasn't intended for you.

My original read of Jea's mail was that taking anything from slsk->cdr and
playing it out was bad, which I don't think was her point.  :)

It's a big deal when you don't want people having it that shouldnt' have
it, when you want people to buy it on vinyl.. we're not talking about
amateur producers here, and tunes that have not yet been released for
sale.  the producers want djs to buy their tunes, not download them for
free and play them and not buy them when they are put out on vinyl.

I also think that taking anything from slsk and playing it out on cdr is
bad.. you're stealing. plain and simple.  Buy the damn record, or cd, etc.
If you can't find it, tough luck.  Look on gemm.com or something.

It's micro$loth?  no wonder they want to sue everyone.  Remeber at one point 
red hat I think set aside a legal fund for people that get sued and sco 
somehow found that it meant that red hat was aggreeing with sco or something, 
don't think I ever saved the link.

I thought for some reason aix sounded familiar but actually it is qnx that my 
audreys use (these little touchscreen web devices that work really nice to 
access a phone list or something.

I've been liking slackware lately.  Just upgraded my main computer to it over 
the weekend from mandrake.  I just saw Arch linux which looks nice and has a 
couple improvements over slackware, like their own package system that works 
alot like apt-get in bsd.  Maybe I'll try that on the laptop sometime.

If you can't find it, tough luck?

That's a business problem with the producer.  There is a demand 
that is not being met with their supply.  Therefore it's not tough 
luck for me, but tough luck for them.  They can hug a root cause 
they chose to press 1000 records when there was demand for 1200.  

As for your comment on the records being unreleased.  that's the 
fatal flaw with dnb, everything is on dubplate for like 2 years. 
takes forever to get to market, yet they play it out.  in other 
genres you dont see that happening as much, because they sit on 
their stuff until it's getting ready to be released in full press.

I was talking with titonton about that when we were at dinner 2 
saturdays ago... it's so hard to hear producers play cdr's that 
you know won't be released for another 6-18 months... but then 
again, they dont do the 100 dubplate release allowing for piracy 
because there isnt nearly enough supply to meet the demand.

That's their own fault on the way they do business.  There is no 
reason for me to pay for their lack of business skills yet 
excellence in their musical ability.

<<It's a big deal when you don't want people having it that shouldnt' have it, when you want people
to buy it on vinyl..>>

Not to be overly argumentative, but then why would someone play a plate out on a regular basis and
then not release it for months or even years as is the case with many producers?

It smacks to me of creating a little bit of a false demand for a product.

It also creates a very "disposable" culture around the music...by the time something is actually
release to the public, they're already drooling over the next thing and that just-released record is
already "obsolete".

And then when someone attempts to avert that system, producers get up in arms. Regardless of the
"right" or "wrong" of it, many seem unaware that they are actually feeding the beast by hoarding.

I certainly don't claim that ALL producers are guilty of this, but the "machinery" in place in the
junglist community (at least the most populous parts of it) has been leading up to this for quite
some time.

Well I think you're over-simplifying things a bit here.  It's not really
up to the producer when the tune comes out on vinyl.  It's up to the label
the tunes are signed to.  And if the label has a P+D deal with a
distributor, it's then up to the distributor as far as when it actually
gets pressed and distributed.  Many producers have absolutely no control
over when their tune comes out.  And in some cases it is not up to them
who they give their tunes out to, someone at the label may give them to a
friend or something, when they shouldn't.

Unless the producer owns their own label and handles every bit of the
label themself, they don't have as much control as you'd like to think,
over their material once it is signed.  When your material is signed to a
label, you are basically giving the label rights to distribute, publish,
sell, etc.

According to that horrible philosophy, you're suggesting that only producers who make "gems" or hits or anthems will ever see any success because those are the only records you will buy, and those producers and labels who make and sell solid, necessary set "filler" for DJs don't have the same right to make a living off what they do because it's not what you would consider to be a "gem?" WRONG! If it's quality enough for you to even think of playing it out just to "test" it, then either you need to buy it or get permission from the label to play it out it as a promo copy.

No, if anything it is a problem with the label, or distributor who
presses and distributes the label in the case of most bigger labels (see
another email for more on this point).  Or it is a problem with you, who
didn't pick up the tune when it came out.  If you don't feel like
searching for it and spending some cash, then it's a real copout to just
download it for free and say "well hey, I don't want to pay big bux for a
used copy of this hard to find record" .. I have hunted down promo-only
major label releases that had pressings of 1000 and even paid more than I
would have wanted for them.  But I could have easily found them on
soulseek or any other place for free, and put them on a CDR and played
them out.  That's just a bullshit copout though.  If you weren't around to
buy it for retail price, and you aren't willing to seek out and find it
now for whatever you might find it for, hopefully a bargain in some dusty
bin somewhere, (which is quite fun), then yes "tough luck" .. downloading
i dont think should be an option there, if you want to be a DJ that
supports the continuation of the electronic music scene.

And this has nothing to do with dnb, this is in general and specifically
I'm NOT talking about dnb, because in dnb newjacks aren't really about in
general finding old great tunes and playing them out (unless you're always
in search of the classics for example), they are all about new tunes that
havent even been released yet.

I think the "fatal flaw" in dnb is only there if you choose to buy into
it.  I don't sweat dubplates, and I just try to play stuff that will sound
as good, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc years from now.  I hope that my mixes will hold
up over time and let the chips fall where they may.  Same with the sets
that I play.  Good music is good music, and it doesn't have a shelf
life.  If a tune is good and it comes out 2 years later, it's still a good
tune.  Like I said, most producers don't have much control over when their
tunes come out.  And really it's just friends giving friends tunes to
play, it's the suckers on boards like DOA who are obsessed with dubplates
and the latest production gimmicks that are perpetuating it, instead of
finding the possibly timeless tunes that are here and there among the
current releases.

I agree. you either buy it and play it (or not play it) or you don't. that
simple.  Otherwise you could just download all the flavor of the week
tunes, play them on cdr, and move on next week .. oh wait, that's already
happening.  I know of plenty of people who used to shop at my friend's
store in jersey, trance djs who play cheesy music at all the jersey shore
clubs, who now no longer buy vinyl. they just download the latest "hot"
tunes and play them off of cdr.  I also see final scratch creeping into
places here in Pittsburgh and in ohio.. I hope to think its for people
playing out their own tunes or their friends unreleased tunes, but somehow
I suspect it's more than that.  Yes maybe plenty of people don't have the
money to buy all of the new vinyl that they'd want to own, but I know
plenty of people who don't have that much money and still find a way,
because it is what they love and they want to do it right.

Let's look at this specific case in point:

Artist - DJ Dara.

Who owns that? Who runs it?

Which is precisely why you get my respect and repetitive praise every time I hear one of your sets

It's a problem with his business still, cause he (or she) chose to 
sign with that label.  That was a business decision they made.

I think you're missing a point in stating that.  How am I 
continuing to support the edm scene, or supporting the producer by 
paying hundreds of dollars for a track that is used just because 
it's so rare that it can afford to have that asking price.  That 
doesnt further the EDM scene nor support the original artist.  I 
said that I will look a reasonable amount of time to find a 
track... reasonable to me being: 4-5 record stores either online 
or offline, ebay, and then doing a google search trying to find a 
random link to an obscure record store that has the track.  It's 
not about sleeping when a record came out.  Hell, there are plenty 
of records that I want that came out before I was born, but since 
i wasnt around for the original release, and they're not really 
repressed all that much anymore, so i guess I'm screwed, eh?

Deejaying is a hobby for me, it's something I have a fun time 
doing.  It's a time when I want to hear what I want to hear that I 
believe will show others what I like and introduce them to that.  
It's not something I do to make money.  I take a nice hit every 
year for that aspect of things.  I also dont have hours and hours 
to search record bins looking for shit that I enjoy listening to, 
if I come across shit that I want, I buy it, if there is something 
that I really want, I look for it as I stated above... that's all 
there is to it, there is no purity aspect involved because 
everything is on wax, it's more communal than that.  It's music, 
it's art, it's something to enjoy.

I dislike the people that I know have zero intention of ever 
buying records of the stuff they play out, I agree with you and 
amy on that one.  I will buy and continue putting money into my 
hobby (and your beloved edm scene), and it will always be a huge 
majority in the favor of vinyl purchases, when that isnt possible, 
yeah, i'll take a couple minutes of my time to get the mp3, cause 
i like to listen to that shit.  it's not like mainstream radio, i 
just cant listen to that shit in my car without having a source 
first.  In the end, your ass isnt making money in this scene 
unless your last name is oakenfold.  We're here for the culture of 
music and social ties anyways.  Jacking music with no intention of 
buying it is bad, i agree, but for me, i have no bad feelings 
about playing a track or 2 out that I had no success on finding 
when I looked for it.

Well, in this case, it was his responsibility to release it to the public.

He was a good man.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

So, if I missed something the first time around, search for it, find it,
and buy it secondhand:

1. The producer doesn't make $ on my second-hand purchase.
2. The label doesn't make $ on my second-hand purchase.
3. I spend hours looking for it.
4. The quality of the copy I procure will probably be less-than-perfect.

So, what's the argument for paying big $$$ for things that are no longer
in print, again?

Specifically,
Planet of the Drums is just Dara, AK1200 and Deeznuts .. it's not a label
at all, it's a name they made for their tour.  Apparantly they made their
own sleeves for their dubplates for whatever reason.  Who even knows what
dubplate in question was stolen.  If dara has tunes coming out on
breakbeat science, I'm sure he reasonably has a good idea when they are
coming out, since he works directly with the people who run the label,
and can control who he gives them to, and ideally who the label gives
them to before release.  But if he has a tune signed to an overseas label,
or say even an album deal with sony, he's not going to have much control
at all about when they come out, or who gets them.

For small labels like Technoir, we basically send records to distributors
and they sell them.  For bigger labels, some of the big distributors might
actually do the pressing and distribution and send out promos etc.  A good
example was the bankrupt Vinyl Distribution in the UK.  They handled a
good many drum n bass labels at one time.  They would decide when things
were coming out, because in the world of "everyone wants to put out a
5x12" LP" things need to be timed right so the market isn't flooded with
things and all the DJs wind up not being able to afford all the records
that would otherwise sell well individually if released on a carefully
timed schedule.  So the people who run the label might sign tunes and send
them off for mastering and have artwork and all that lined up, but the
deal is, the distributor presses the record, sells it, and then shares the
profit with the label.  This way the label has less risk involved, and
uses the distributor's leverage as an advantage (For example they probably
could get a good deal on pressing when they have 10 labels they are
constantly pressing records for, versus a small label with just 1 record
every few months being pressed).  The distributor gets a larger profit,
but assumes more risk. And the label has to go by the distributor's
schedule.

Not that was not at all was I was saying but thanks for defining it for
everyone else. By gems I mean gems to the dj tracks they want. You know the
ones they would buy if they went and sat in a record store or on some
website. I am not talking about going out and burning everything to cdr and
only playing a couple tracks on vinyl, nor am saying only buy the floor
fillers. It is a whole lot easier to download some tracks and "read" them at
home and play with them to really get a sense for the track. then it is to
spend 10 hours online listening to 2 minute samples. Or going to a record
store and having to choose from what the store decided to buy. I was saying
dj's are more respectable and will buy the tracks they are going to use then
we are giving them credit for.

God if I could count all the times I loved something at the store and after
4 or 5 plays ended up just not digging the track.

That's the nature of the vinyl game. It's not paying big $$$, because most
likely one man's trash is another man's treasure, and you can often find
what you are looking for cheap, where no one else wants it.  This is the
fun with vinyl.  That you can't just copy someone elses record and play it
yourself. It also means that if you are around, and have good taste,
you'll have the tunes and quality selection to prove it.

Jwan has plenty of techno and house tunes I'd love to own, but I'm not
going to just download them on MP3 and play them out on final scratch,
that'd be ridiculous.  If I want to listen to them I can go to his house,
or even borrow them if he would be so willing.

The problem is not so much with stuff thats ridiculously hard to find, the
problem is that once you cross the line and download and play out stuff
that you never paid for, it only gets easier.  And then once enough people
are in the game at the point where most of them don't remember a time when
you couldn't just download tunes for free, if there aren't taboos and
stigmas in place to prevent it, that's exactly what will happen.  The fact
that to play something out I need a physical copy of it makes vinyl
hunting fun, and it makes it possible for small record labels to exist.
But now the line is blurring and for the people who want to download stuff
for free and listen to it, that's great, but when that starts becoming the
behavior of djs, I think its a bad thing, because record labels and
artists count on djs to buy their music overall. .. the downloading out of
print stuff is not as harmfull, but its a contributor to the attitude that
it's OK.. most people aren't going to make the distinction after a certain
point between tunes that are impossible to find, and brand new releases,
when it is just as easy and quick to get both for free.

I really believe that this issue isn't has huge as we are making it. Dj's
are buying and supporting the scene worldwide. Bedroom dj's may be playing
all ripped shit but who the hell cares its not the audience that the
producer was going for. Ever have the urge to try out a new genre and see if
you can feel it. Are you going to go drop 2000 grand on tracks or download a
bunch and see what happens as you fuck around.

Well the bedroom and local DJs are the majority ones who are buying the
vinyl, it's part of the whole pyramid scheme that is the "rave/club DJ
Circuit" .. So it's very important that they continue to buy vinyl.

As far as the rest of what you're saying, you're talking to the wrong
guy.. most of the people I know here have rooms full of vinyl and go to
Jerry's at least once a month.  While I might play drum n bass out a lot,
I also have a few hundred techno, house and broken beat records, as well
as a ton of hip hop, classic rock, 80s synth pop, indie, etc.  It's all
just music.  People who only buy one genre of records are only hurting
themselves by not exploring all that's out there.

Subject: RE: RE: {pb-cle} BUSTED!!!!

So I've been sitting here and watching this thread. First off, stealing
outta Dara's record bag is just wrong, and I'd have ejected this dude
into the clean warm waters of the Cuyahoga by now if it was be being
stolen from. You reach into my bag, I rip off your hand and shove it up
your ass. Period. (Yeah, I'm still on this quitting smoking kick, it's
been a week now, but I'm still an asshole.) It's speculation as to what
this guy actually did, so I'm not talking about this particular event in
time, just the thought of stealing from someone. 

As far as the rest of it goes, the business model needs to evolve. It's
something I've always said, and don't feel like repeating. Read the
archives.

My biggest gripe is that I spent a *lot* of time broke, and I started
buying vinyl late ('99?) in the game.  There's a lot of shit that I hope
to find, but the list is large, and the funds are limited.

hey...if u rip something exclusive...dont put it in your shared folder...its
that friggin simple

u can tell the difference between actual illegal dubs and dubs that were
probably up'd by the producer...illegal dubs are mad noisy...whereas dubs
that were probably put up by the producer are crystal clear

It may just seem like "fucking around," but it's not just "fucking around" to the labels and distributors who invest thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars to get music out there to support the artists whose next meal and rent payment depends on your buying that record and not ripping it. 

Do you walk into a department store and steal a suit, justifying the theft by saying you're only going to wear it once to your cousin's wedding, maybe twice if you wear it to grandma's funeral? 

If you think it's expensive to buy records now, just wait until the pirates keep stealing music. The price will go up to the point that it will be completely out of the hands of the bedroom DJ, and producers will only share music with people they trust, and there will be no more bedroom or local DJs, just an elite circle of consummate professionals who will control the quality music and will only share it with those they believe that actually deserve to play it. 

As has been the trend in recent years, the only new "headlining" DJs will be the ones who also produce music, because they contribute to the food chain instead of just taking from it. 

Support the scene and the scene will support you.

Subject: Re: RE: RE: {pb-cle} BUSTED!!!!

i hate to break this to all of you...but vinyl will be a dead medium in less
than 10 years...its too expensive for the labels to keep putting it out and
cover their asses...as soon as the labels can find a way to do digital
securely...they'll quit doing vinyl or they'll jack the price of vinyl up
150%

oh sure...there'll still be ppl playing vinyl...but i think for the most
part...new vinyl will stop being pressed...its just too much money...for a
grand you can have a run of 300 records done...mastering, plating,
dubplates, test presses, the whole 9 yards...or for 300 bux you can buy mad
blanks cds...give some ppl your tunes on cd...give other mix
sets...whatever...and despite what the elitists say...if a tune is mastered
properly...its gonna sound the same analog or digital...lets face it...if u
were out at a club...and couldnt see what the dj was doing...could u tell
the difference between a vinyl record and a cd? i doubt it.

thats just the way it is. evolve or die.

this is EXACTLY the argument ive been making about jungle for 
years now. its horrible both for fostering creativity in the scene 
and for business in general. but it keeps all the deejay gigs in a 
small circle of people and they wont let it be any other way.

this is so entirely true that it hurts. how does paying ebay 
prices for out of print vinyl help anyone (aside from the seller's 
wallet) any more than DLing and burning? it doesnt, not one tiny 
bit. i hate the fact that some labels are so exclusive with their 
shit, its just bad for everyone involved. even they could make 
more money by keeping the most popular stuff in print.

Subject: RE: RE: RE: {pb-cle} BUSTED!!!!

First I must clarify, that my music purchases in a month are pretty much
the equivalent of leasing a BMW. 

And on that note, I will say, that to Ed's point, it's bad business. The
model is retarded, and by not meeting demand, you're only cheating
yourself, the artist, the customer, and eveyrone else in the chain. The
point is that a lot of times, I want something I can't buy. I work my
ass off 70-80 hours a week most times, and it's not that I won't drop
the cash, it's that it's just not for sale. And often a year after I
hear a track, or it's just out of print, or whatever. 

So I guess maybe that drives up the want-lust for a record. Maybe there
is some sort of method to the madness. But if I'm willing to pay for
something, why can't I have it? 

I would understand if the model was something like some DJ is out
promoting a record by spinning it, drives up demand for it, and then
sells a bunch of copies when it's released, but I dunno whether its from
disorganization or what, but I can tell you I'm going to find something
else that suits my fancy after 8 months of waiting for a release. 

So yeah, I'm talking about jungle. I don't have any of those kinds of
records anymore. I just read Tom's email as I was writing this, and
amazingly, I think I have now agreed with him twice this year. As much
as I once liked the music, the scene around it pissed me off to where I
don't want to hear it. 

I guess I still have my squarepusher to listen to. (btw., you can buy
the new one from bleep and get two extra tracks that you won't find on
the release).

And, IMHO, PA's will rock records in the next 10 years.

It may just seem like "fucking around," but it's not just "fucking
around" to the labels and distributors who invest thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars to get music out there
to support the artists whose next meal and rent payment depends on your
buying that record and not ripping it. 

Do you walk into a department store and steal a suit, justifying the
theft by saying you're only going to wear it once to your cousin's
wedding, maybe twice if you wear it to grandma's funeral? 

If you think it's expensive to buy records now, just wait until the
pirates keep stealing music. The price will go up to the point that it
will be completely out of the hands of the bedroom DJ, and producers
will only share music with people they trust, and there will be no more
bedroom or local DJs, just an elite circle of consummate professionals
who will control the quality music and will only share it with those
they believe that actually deserve to play it. 

As has been the trend in recent years, the only new "headlining" DJs
will be the ones who also produce music, because they contribute to the
food chain instead of just taking from it. 

Support the scene and the scene will support you.

The issue has nothing to do with the medium. Vinyl, CD, or .mp3 -- stealing is stealing and it's wrong. 

People are trying to blame the industry saying that it's because people want to use CDs and laptops that they are avoiding the vinyl purchase, and it's a marginal -- at best -- excuse. 

The main reason people rip music is because they want something for nothing.

Vinyl extinction and the advantages of digital formats is a different issue from theft.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} BUSTED!!!!

Now I definately do download the tracks that are available on Soul Seek 
and I do play around with them at home to see if it is worth buying or 
not.  It's much beter than relying on a minute long crap ass real audio 
clip.  I call it being more selective.  There is still a lot of garbage 
records on the shelf and if I help to weed out those weak producers then 
I am all for it.  The best will always manage to survive and the group 
that I call the best is getting bigger all the time.

What Nick said too... although I don't have proof, I would bet money on 
the fact that a lot of those dubs are leaked by the artists themselves.  
Just look at Pendulum... one of the most heavilly traded dnb artists on 
the net at the moment... at least 5 of there forthcomming tracks were 
readilly available on Soul Seek some of them even on Kazaa BUT the one 
most sought after track of thiers, that is being rinsed constantly by 
the a-list, "Another Planet"  is nearly non-exsistant on p2p... seems 
kinda fishy to me.

Well, that artist is a fucking moron then.  Music does not pay the 
bills.  Art does not pay the bills.  Unless you're really business 
motivated and damn talented.  And then, you're making more than 
enough to worry about rent money.  Tell the artist to get a day 
job like the other 'starving artists' of the world.  It's silly to 
think that you can just sit home and make music and hope to sell 
enough records to keep from going broke (unless your name is tom 
cox).

I don't know anyone who's into music that doesnt have a day job 
that pays the bills and everything else is extra.

As I get dangerously close to hitting the daily limit...

Yeah, like I said. Stealing is wrong. I will cut of someones hand if
they steal from me. Well, maybe not, but I may yell and whine. 

But laptops and cd's as an excuse not to purchase vinyl? Cases in point:

Richard Devine: DJ's with traktor and two Titanium powerbooks synced via
OSC (like midi timing). 

PVD: In love with FS (side note: new FS release the other day)

Rahlo (Blacksoilproject): Went digital. Uses Live.

The entire Kanzleramt Crew: Using Live.

Modeselektor: DJ'ing with Live.

The list of people using digital technology is actually staggering. It's
called pushing boundries, and the tools are about ready. I want to use
CD's and laptops. I don't even use download clients. There are plenty of
folks who rip their own music for reasons other than illegal ones. My
dad has a giant music collection, likes to make playlists to have dinner
with my mom by. There are hundreds of thousands of people using things
like the iTunes music store. 

The REAL problem is people using technology as the scapegoat for
stealing. Yes, I agree that vinyl extinction and the advantages of
digital formats is a different issue from theft. But record companies
for the most part don't see that, they see digital formats as nothing
but a method for stealing. 

But then again, I think DJ'ing is over rated, and I don't elevate it to
any other status than playing other peoples music to begin with. It all
seems kind of assinine to me in the end.

The issue has nothing to do with the medium. Vinyl, CD, or .mp3 --
stealing is stealing and it's wrong. 

People are trying to blame the industry saying that it's because people
want to use CDs and laptops that they are avoiding the vinyl purchase,
and it's a marginal -- at best -- excuse. 

The main reason people rip music is because they want something for
nothing.

Vinyl extinction and the advantages of digital formats is a different
issue from theft.

Warp Records (Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Nightmares on Wax,
Squarepusher, Two Lone Swordsmen) sells their entire back catalog online,
in MP3 format, and have some faith that the customers aren't thieves,
given good alternative.

And that rocks.

My original point (when I think I started this) was that stealing a
whitelabel outta someone's crate is a hella lot more wrong than
downloading a mp3 of the same track.

But my question is: if I download an old song, no longer obtainable by me
on vinyl, who am I stealing from?

If vinyl extinction causes a massive shortage of product, then no, they
aren't necessarily different.

Subject: {pb-cle} vinyl vs digital

nick s said something like:

>digital and vinyl are the same if mastered right...

I say something like:

sure, but mastering to analog makes the grooves and smooths out 
the medium that you cant even begin to attempt with digital 
because it's impossible.  sure, they may be mastered identical, 
but the friction from the needle in the groove makes the sound so 
much fuller and smoother.  sure, you could probably toss on an 
alesis fx of some sort (tube pre-amp) and get "similar" results 
to 'warm' up the sound, but hey, whatever... I know all the clubs 
that have cd dex also have tube pre-amps.  especially in akron.  
the type of event that you're gonna hear electronic at anymore is 
probably not gonna have a rack of equipment to make things sound 
better, so why not just use the vinyl and skip that step?

and the reason you think that there isnt a difference between cd 
and vinyl is cause for the most part the systems are probably 
underpowered and distorted.  here's a good test system for you 
though... use moose's mackies and play a cd of the same thing you 
have on vinyl.  it will sound so much better with vinyl, i 
guarantee.  that way you're taking out the distortion factor.

AMEN.

I know one thing.  I play tunes out on CD in my sets, and they sound 100 
times better than any record, and I say this with 3000+ records sitting 
behind me in my living room.

I feel like I've been gypped in some ways.  Now I have to encode all my 
tunes to mp3 so I can play em out and not break my back carrying around 
150 piece of vinyl to gigs all over the country.

PAs suck ass.

Hopefully BANDS will take the place of dudes playing other dudes' music.

You're a moron.  Copying something is not stealing.  Stealing is when you 
take something from someone.  MAKING A COPY is not stealing, it's MAKING A 
COPY.

CDs sound better than vinyl.  It's not an excuse at all, it's the truth.  
Vinyl sucks.

If it takes you four or five guys to kick out dance tunes, you need to set
down the bong and put some shoes on, ya dirty hippie.

In the meantime, PAs roxor.

Hippie?!  LOL, you're kidding right?

And no, I don't want to play "dance tunes", I want to play Rave Music.

Bands are way better, there are more people on stage, and more chances to 
have atrractive people on stage.

Better marketing potential.  More commercial familiarity, etc.

No, they don't.

it seems the only labels that actually keep popular stuff in print are the 
pussy trance lables

the edm scene has too many elitists running things...and in the end thats 
whats gonna kill it....not the riaa, not the federales...elitists at the top 
that are too interested in protecting their gigs, wallets, and the 
exclusivness of what they have in their box.

Subject: RE: Re: RE: RE: {pb-cle} BUSTED!!!!

if u rip something...you own it...u cant rip an mp3...cuz an mp3 has already 
been ripped...ie extracted from cd/dat/md or recorded from vinyl/tape

heres another point too...me personally...i dont get to buy vinyl as much as 
id like....im not only interested in djing, im interested in 
producing...both are expensive hobbies...my financial situation leaves me 
with the chance once a month to buy vinyl or improve my studio....now...when 
i know i have a gig coming up...i put that money towards vinyl...but most 
months i dont have gigs, so i put my money towards sample cds, soft synths, 
new hardware, whatever...

soo

i download singles...yes...why...so i know what to look for when i goto the 
shop....when u hear something in the headphones at the record store...its 
not the same as listening to it on studio monitors or on pa speakers

and when i do goto the record store...i usually spend a good chunk of 
change...

when i played the odi show....i think most of my set was vinyl...cept for a 
gpk track i played offa cd...and i think i played one of bombs tunes or 
logiq's tunes offa cd...same deal with new years...and field day

but in the end...i still believe in my heart of hearts that 90% of the leaks 
come directly from the producer....the whole piracy thing and p2p apps is 
like handguns....sure u can use a handgun for something illegal, but there 
is plenty u can use them for legally too.

UR keeps most of their stuff in constant print, one of the many 
reasons i love them.

end thats

>exclusivness of what they have in their box.

this might be the moment where you and i agree more than we ever 
have on anything before. if everything was always in print, people 
could be much more easily edumacated about the ill shit. hearing 
good music out wouldnt be such a rare treat. i cant understand why 
people wouldnt just keep things in print. after a certain point it 
becomes just pure profit to repress. if i had a tune that everyone 
wanted, id make sure that every person who wanted it had a copy, 
plus there were more sitting on the shelves of shops everywhere 
for when new people got into it. making the history of dance music 
so unattainable can only be a bad thing, probably the worst thing 
that could happen to it.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} vinyl vs digital

our sound is just as quality as moose's(jbl sr-x boxes, qsc touring amps, 
and all the processing u could hope for including a tc finaliser)

now...when i played a cd thru the cotton sound system to test it for bass 
and lace(the last time we took it out full scale)it sounded perfect...even 
with the processing bypassed....the turntables sounded the same...did the 
same thing at pollens with a cd and a vinyl thru his mackie hr824s...and at 
bombs house...he has truths....bottom line....if u closed your eyes and i 
played a cd vs a clean record...i doubt u could tell the difference...i 
didnt believe that either...til i had someone play a cd vs a record for me 
with my eyes closed

as for clubs in akron....i didnt see any tube gear at annabelles(the only 
club ive been to in akron)...i just saw a bunch of behringer stuff and 
carvin boxes

FRIDAY, FEB 20, 2004:  PHOTEK + MAMPI SWIFT [both artists in main room!]

OPEN BAR from 9 p.m. - 10 p.m.

Two drum =8Cn=B9 bass legends explore different variations of the drum =8Cn=B9 bass
sound on Nation=B9s Avalon sound system.  Photek, on the deeper tip, has been
reinventing his sound over the past 10 years under numerous guises.  A
perfectionist when it comes to music, his meticulously produced beats will
resonate strongly within Nation=B9s main room.  Mampi Swift is in charge of
the aptly titled, Charge Recordings.  His distinctive gritty basslines have
always earned him high marks in the drum =8Cn=B9 bass ranks.  But in the past
year, he has been one of the major forces twisting drum =8Cn=B9 bass into its
newest sonic incarnation.  Strong releases such as the two Transformers
EP=B9s, =8CAutobots=B9 and =8CDecepticons=B9 and the recent apocalyptic sounding
=8CZion/World of Change=B9 are proof that in 2004, hard drum =8Cn=B9 bass can no
longer be dismissed as angry noise, but as thought-provoking, soulful yet
riveting music that represents the future as much as it does our  futile
world today.  Check out their websites for more information.

Beatport Goes Live

Crate-diggers and DJs take note: the launch of dance music-specific download sites may signal the
end of pre-gig sprints to the record store
and weekends spent shuffling through boxes. January 1 brought a notable new player to the expanding
list of high-quality sites — Beatport.com.
This slick new site boasts a deep catalog of both high-profile and trendsetting independent labels
representing genres from trance and drum
'n bass to electro and downtempo.


Designed and developed by and for professional DJs and dance music enthusiasts, Beatport.com
features high quality mp3, mp4, and .wav
tracks, Top 10 lists from some of the world's best DJs, clubs, and labels, major club and tastemaker
playlists, genre-specific community
forums, detailed label profiles, streaming flash track previews, and even a white label club. Jonas
Tempel, president of Beatport.com, says
that "Beatport was custom-designed for a single purpose — to build a name that is really on the
forefront of the dance music scene by
creating a cool online record store with a vibe."

Tempel also notes, "Demand for vinyl and dance music has shrunk dramatically because it's not as
popular anymore, and access points for
entry level DJs are limited. This should open up access points for people to discover dance music on
their own, and grow the dance music
marketplace at the same time." Beatport adds a strong new voice to an impressive and ever-growing
list of sites dedicated to dance and
electronic downloads, a list that already includes such standouts as Audio Lunchbox, Nufonix, and
trax2burn. (CW)

I absolutely love how they have the soundclips set up... online 
record stores would be definately dope if they did it the same way 
with everything built into the site instead of using realplayer 
externally as most do...

Dear guests,

I told everyone that the Lounge Rotation would be back with bigger 
and better things.  Obviously our lounge event at the Green Room 
is hot on Saturday's, but we've now just added a new Friday night 
event (STARTING THIS FRIDAY NIGHT):

WELCOME TO THE BRAND NEW OPIUM LOUNE.  Here is a sneak peek about 
the party this Friday night:

Three rooms - lounge, vip and dance floor/dj booth.
300 PEOPLE ONLY
10+ VIP tables
Bottle service
Miami lounge feel
Friday Night 8p - 2am
346 High Street (right next to the Westin) corner of High & Mound
$3 cover before midnight/$5 after midnight
Strict dress code, smoking permitted

EMAIL CHRIS OR CALL AT 614.332.1218 IF YOU WOULD LIKE A TABLE 
RESERVATION FOR EITHER THE GREEN ROOM OR OPIUM LOUNGE.  

I think Columbus nightlife may be back!

EDMDigital is set to go live very soon as well.  Hopefully they're following 
a similar format.

Hopefully they stick to offering .wav files for those that want the high

Subject: {pb-cle} thurs @ havana - sorta sauce


tomorrow night is milk night @ havana
with guests edgar um & dj kevin
& of course, dc space

they'll be bringing their current selections of house, downtempo, broken
stuffs and all things truly funky.

i have a mess of 'soul nibbler' cds thanks to mike s - be sure to grab one.
kevin used over 100 old funk and soul records from jerry's warehouse giveaway
on this one.  hopefully i'll have a few of each of the fruit mixes on me too. 
all of these come with a 'get lucky guarantee' :)

no cover, 21+...& jason will get to the rest later in the week

last time was great.  i think the best attended thurs at havana ?

see yinz thursday!

Question for y'all;

Does WAV/raw audio/CD audio offer a higher actual quality than, say, a
320kbps MP3?

obviously it does. wav is uncompressed 16 bit audio. the 
difference isnt going to be as bad as with a 128 kbps mp3 but you 
can fit more mp3s on a cd than you can audio files for a 
reason.....

Nope. As long as the encoder isn't total shit, not as far as any human ears can tell.

I seriously doubt that anyone could tell the difference between a 160k variable bitrate mp3 and the original either.

"Audiophiles" might disagree, but not one of them would be willing to test themselves with ABX equipment to see what they really hear. Of course, these are the same people who would pay $10,000 for their speaker wire...

By definition, mp3, jpeg, etc all these awesome new generation compression
technologies are "lossy" .. so yes, wavs will always offer higher quality,
since they are the original source and mp3s are compressed.  Maybe at some
point, depending on the quality of the production and all that, the
difference might be almost negligible.  But if you are using something
like classical music as a reference you could probably tell the difference
between any mp3 and a wav.

if it's variable bitrate then you can't say "160k variable bitrate" unless
160k is the max?  I take all of my mixes and make htem into 160k mp3s ..
they definitely don't sound as good as the CD version ..  close enough to
get the job done, but you can still tell the difference.

The encoder will try to average the bitrate over the entire recording to 160k. It will go higher in more complicated spots and lower if there's not much going on.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} MP3 quality?

Like I said, try it out yourself.

http://www.pcabx.com/

There used to be a site I'm just remembering where they had some people with 'golden ears' doing a double-blind test comparing mp3 and the source material. Their conclusions were that anything above 256k is a waste, because nobody in their panel could tell the difference with any accuracy. Hmm. It used to be at

http://www.r3mix.net

But it looks like that site was squatted on. I'll see if I can dig up their results somewhere else...

The proof is in the pudding.  I would be happy to upload a 320k MP3 and a WAV file taken directly from the same raw audio out of my mixer into my computer when I get home tonight and you can all hear it for yourselves.  I don't think that anyone would use any word close to "shit" to describe the encoding capabilities of SoundForge, either.

	Nope. As long as the encoder isn't total shit, not as far as any human ears can tell.
	
	I seriously doubt that anyone could tell the difference between a 160k variable bitrate mp3 and the original either.
	
	"Audiophiles" might disagree, but not one of them would be willing to test themselves with ABX equipment to see what they really hear. Of course, these are the same people who would pay $10,000 for their speaker wire...

on that pcabx site, i could tell the tone quality up till 
the "near impossible" level on some harman/kardon laptopspeakers. 
im sure at my "professional" setup (according to them: delta 44 
and event 20/20bas monitors with balanced cables) at my house id 
be able to tell even that. if you know what youre listening for, 
its not that hard really. their sound sample probably wasnt the 
best for it. the parts where you can most hear the difference is 
in the upper frequency harmonics, on a percussion sample its not 
going to be as noticeable as it would on say a violin sample. 
obviously its going to depend on your purposes for the audio 
whether youd want it in wav or mp3, but the difference is pretty 
easy to hear. i have much more difficulty hearing high end loss on 
ogg files, for whatever reason they sound much much much better.

"In plain language, this means that our musically trained test listeners could reliably distinguish the poorer quality MP3s at 128 kbps quite accurately from either of the other higher-quality samples. But when deciding between 256 kbps encoded MP3s and the original CD, no difference could be determined, on average, for all the pieces. The testers took the 256 kbps samples for the CD just as often as they took the original CD samples themselves."

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MP3 quality?

you guys are going about this all wrong

use a spectral analyzer...run an uncompressed .wav file thru the spectral
analyzer and run an mp3 thru the spectral analyzer

its pretty close...if u do a search on dogsonacid you'll see the
results...somebody from the grid did this recently

i beleive sound forge has a spectral analyzer built in to it.

Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

No, VBR 160 is maxing the bitrate at 160.
ABR 160 will do it's best to average the bitrate to 160.

At least, on the encoders I'm familiar with.

Yes, an mp3 does change the sound waves. The whole point is to throw away the sounds that the human ear wouldn't perceive anyway. After all, if you can't hear the difference, does it really matter?

you guys are going about this all wrong

use a spectral analyzer...run an uncompressed .wav file thru the spectral
analyzer and run an mp3 thru the spectral analyzer

its pretty close...if u do a search on dogsonacid you'll see the
results...somebody from the grid did this recently

i beleive sound forge has a spectral analyzer built in to it.

After all, if you can't hear the difference, does it really matter?

more than a few people have argued that those audibly undetectable
frequencies likely effect us in some way when they are part of the
sound, and im generally inclined to believe them. 

this is also pretty funny considering how low-quality 16 bit audio
is going to turn out to be very soon in the future. the difference
between 16 and 24 bit is extremely audible, and as the music
industry changes over to 24 bit CDs and wav's will start to sound
shitty to everyone in comparison. 

me, i prefer 8 bit. fuck a fidelity.

LAME is a much better encoder to the Fraunhaufer used by SoundForge.
In comparison, yes... SF mp3 encoding IS shit.

>No, VBR 160 is maxing the bitrate at 160.

Not quite. If you encode using lame using (-v -V 0), you can see from the graph it generates that some of the frames are encoded at up to 320, even though the whole thing averages to something else. There are other options you can set that would make it max out at 160 (or anything else), though.

>ABR 160 will do it's best to average the bitrate to 160.

Yes, you're right on this. Using --abr gives you an average of whatever you specify, which would still be better than using a constant bitrate.

I believe using a variable bitrate increases the file size quite a bit
though, correct? as well as taking up more CPU cycles when playing back
files?

Generally, those are the same people who are arguing for the $10,000 speaker wire that I was talking about earlier.

The only advantage to the new formats are the multiple channels. As far as actual sound quality is concerned, "old" 16 bit cd audio already reproduces sound better than 99+ percent of the population can hear. The added bits add nothing to the final product but marketing value. Your dog might appreciate the expanded dynamic range, but most of us ravers have already damaged our hearing below even the average persons.

If anyone can show any real evidence that shows people can tell the difference between the 2, I'd love to see it. Honestly.

>me, i prefer 8 bit. fuck a fidelity. 

It's all 1 bit to me.

Didn't know SF was using Fraunhaufer.  Yeah, I could see that you'd hear a
difference between the two there.

Hrrm.

Might have to grab a CD (or piece of vinyl), encode to WAV, then LAME the
WAV to MP3.

Regarding OGG (think Tom mentioned it), ogg is higher quality at the same
bitrate, or smaller files at the same quality, when compared to MP3.

I was talking about VBR 160, and how that should max out at 160.  -v -V 0
isn't VBR 160, though.  If I remember right, -V 0 is top quality VBR,
which would max at 320.  So, yeah, what's the point again?

CBR == constant bit rate.  The standard/usual option.

VBR 320 should have the same quality as CBR 320, but take less disk space.
However, it'll take more processor to play.  the IPod doesn't have any
problems with VBR, so I'm assuming it's not a ton of extra processing.

ABR (average bit rate) is like VBR, but instead of setting a maximum
bitrate, you just set what you want the average to be.  VBR lets you pick
your quality; ABR lets you pick your filesize.  For most purposes, VBR is
probably the better choice.

If you encode using lame using (-v -V 0), you can see from the graph it generates that some of the frames are encoded at up to 320, even though the whole thing averages to something else.

Not sure; my IPod isn't down with ogg, so I haven't moved over to the
format yet.

My guess is that the encoder for ogg also defaults the lowpass cutoff
higher.  That is, it cuts at a higher frequency; I think LAME defaults to
19.2kHz, but that's poor memory.  I know that I *used* to be able to hear
over 20kHz, so LAME is losing something there...

Well, how about this, I am working on some music, and I record it at 24
bit, 48khz .. then I master it and dither it down to 16 bit. It sounds
clearer and better than when I record it at 16 bit 44.1 khz and then
master it, because what I start with is a better source (The 24 bit 48khz
recording).  I don't know, maybe I'm crazy, but I (and many other people)
can hear the difference, which is what its there for.

Maybe it uses a different dithering algorithm or something like that. I
mean really the whole dithering process is very fascinating. You should
read up on it.

for moda?
seems a silly idea to me to mimic a miami bar anyhow.
well they did try a studio 54 in clev before didn't they.... such

{{ Malachi <luke@goaheadproductions.com> }
Anyone thinking of going?? }}

I was just about to ask the same question... The answer is YES! Very much
so...

I've even been working on some preliminary designs for a shelter. Nothing
big like a theme camp, but possibly a lightweight desert home for up to 6
people if there's enough interest. Think Unity House of Love on steroids and
shrooms.

I'd really like to do this. Logistics is a bitch if you want to build a
house out there in Black Rock, but anything is possible if you put your mind
to it. Aircraft cable is expensive, though.

Let's do it!

Well, at least they are not making the cover $50 or some crap like 
that, although they don't mention prices for vip.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies
(these are moving into the ROM itself)

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Fri Feb 27                      THIRD EYE V3                      Cleveland

[my unofficial birthday party!]

Friday, Feb 27 2004
The Third Eye V.3
Cleveland, Oh

The Goahead Productions Third Eye series continues. With this edition
we revisit the dark and lovely aspects of techno and psytrance.


Lori the Hifi Princess – Psytech – Austria

International DJ Hi-Fi Princess, aka Lori Ward, has been establishing
herself in the underground party scene since 1993.

Having taken part in the ever-changing music scene throughout Europe
(England, Belgium, Germany, Macedonia, Slovenia, Austria, Spain, Croatia,
and Finland) Hi- Fi Princess's sound has evolved into a sophisticated mix
of techno and psychedelic music. She has spun with some of the biggest
names in techno/psy trance (Hallucinogen, Orion, Chris Liberator, Mark
E.G., G-force, Chris Liebing, Oscar Mulero, Futureshock, W.J Henze,
Franchesco Farfa, and Renato Cohen). She has also played at some of the
best clubs and festivals in the world.  (Tunnel-MYC, Liquid Club-Madrid,
Koneisto Festival-Finland, The Best-Zagreb, Ambasada Gavioli-Slovenia,
Mazzo-Amsterdam, Sona-Montreal Canada, Turbo-Toronto Canada, 1015
Folsom-San Francisco. Club Kuaille-Tokyo, Japan.Cittadella, Brno-
Czech.Stereodrome, Bratislava-Slovakia.Fever-Vienna.Nuke Festival-
Zwentendorf.Suncity, Graz)

Lori had her first release on Shimmy Recordings out of Bristol, U.K. Her
track, Refused Entry, was released June 12, 2000 on the Collective
Thoughts EP.  This E.P had great reviews in Wax, Out of Hand, Mixer
Magazine, and by some of the top DJs in the business.

http://www.sistersf.com/guestDJs/hifiprincess.php

Sequential Tom - www.futuretechartists.com/tom.html – U.S.A

'Sequential' Tom's involvement with electronic dance music began in the
early '90s when he moved to Amsterdam. His first experience at a 'house
party' pretty much charted the course of events: he started spending every
free minute in the record shops; he sold his electric guitar for a
Juno-106. Staying five years in Amsterdam, Tom relentlessly absorbed the
dance culture and eventually picked up the DJing habit and some production
experience.  In early '97 he packed his vinyl and headed back to New York
City, with an interest in bringing the european underground trance sound
to the States.  He landed a job at NYC's famous Throb records, where he
met members of the notorious Polymorphous crew. They began organizing
parties together, and Tom soon became a regular sight behind the decks on
Friday nights at the legendary club Vinyl, where he enjoyed a residency
with Polymorphous. During his tenure there he played alongside many great
acts from the trance scene. He's delivered on many of NYC's finest
dancefloors, at clubs like Vinyl, Speeed, Cream, Anseo, etc., and at
numerous parties. No stranger to airports, he's also played all over the
U.S. and Canada, in western and eastern Europe, and in Japan and Asia.  
Although Tom raised eyebrows and caught ears as an innovative, technical,
and cheeky DJ on the U.S. trance scene, his taste in DJing has since gone
in a more techno-oriented direction. His eclectic background still comes
through in his sets, but it is undeniably techno at the essence of every
moment.  Multifaceted, the man also works as a graphic artist and web
hack.  Accordingly his interest in the visual arts is developed, and is
seen to hold relation to all his musical endeavors.

Fri Feb 27                         WINKYDO                      Amherst, NY

Josh Wink & David Alvarado
 
Josh Wink

In 1995, Wink became one of the first DJ-producers to translate his hard 
work into mainstream success, when he unleashed a string of classics, 
including "Don't Laugh," "I'm Ready," and "Higher State of Consciousness," 
that topped charts worldwide, and made him a bona fide pop star in Europe. 
On his 1998 album, HereHear, Wink pushed boundaries even further, inviting 
fellow artists as diverse as Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails), Caroline 
Crawley (Shelleyann Orphan/This Mortal Coil), and Philly poet-performer 
Ursula Rucker (Jazzanova, The Roots), to contribute to a far-reaching disc 
that ran the gamut of electronic music styles, from ambient and trip-hop 
to drum & bass, as well as the trademark mix of house and techno on which 
Wink has built his international reputation.

Josh Wink has always run ahead of the pack, as a DJ, label owner, 
producer, remixer, and artist. With the release of Profound Sounds Vol. 2, 
Wink continues to forge ahead, challenging established conventions of what 
a mix CD should be, not only by remaining true to his mercurial aesthetic 
as a DJ, but also taking advantage of technology to fine-tune his 
selections into the best possible recorded representation of Josh Wink.

The sound of Josh Wink today remains one of a man unafraid to walk the 
border between stylistic boundaries. Profound Sounds Vol. 2 starts off 
dark and atmospheric with "Form Is Emptiness" by Swayzak, then quickly 
builds momentum with the minimal and melodic Joshua Main mix of Rithma's 
"Tracks for a Weirder Day." The 73-minute mix incorporates hints of old 
school Chicago house ("Make A Move" by Minimal Man), electro ("E Series 2" 
by Frankie Bones), and even Latin and tribal house ("Auburn" by David 
Alvarado). Perhaps the finest example of Wink's refusal to limit his play 
list to any one genre comes at the three-quarter mark, when he integrates 
Aaron Carl's paean to house music, "The Word," over techno-flavored tracks 
courtesy of Rino Cerrone and Mr. G.

"I get bored if I do the same thing.. Some people get pigeonholed as being 
into just one thing. I hate that. When there are rules, it doesn't become 
art, and it's not fun. I've learned that you can't please everybody, so 
I'd rather be concerned with making good art, and the people that like 
this art will stick with you."

P'raps you've heard some of his tracks... take a look at:
http://www.discogs.com/artist/Josh_Wink

David Alvarado

"My sound and the music that I produce all comes from my roots and 
history."

Born and bred in Los Angeles, DJ/Producer David Alvarado has been 
carefully developing his smooth, soulful house signature that is deeper 
than the Atlantic Ocean since he was a teenager. Solidly entrenched in 
America's house underground and boasting a growing global following, he's 
played a pivotal role in shaping the dozen disparate cuts on his 
critically acclaimed Bomb Records indie, while cutting glistening tracks 
and remixes for labels like Ovum, Definitive, and Groove On. Embracing a 
musical, less is more, ethos to all of his vinyl work, David's motivation 
behind the decks or in the studio has been to always add a new wrinkle to 
dance music's vibrant fabric.

DJ TOMMIE SUNSHINE Biography:

Raised on equal parts of Kraftwerk, AC/DC, and Farley Jackmaster Funk,
mid-west rave legend Tommie Sunshine (aka Tom America) and Chicago native
has relocated to New York has rocked the house with regular appearances at
the now legendary Tribeca Grand club nights, the Electroclash festival and
after-show duty for Bjork on her forthcoming East Coast shows. A mix CD
and a single on Gigolo Records are also forthcoming.

After six years in Georgia where he ran Satellite Records Atlanta and held
down two residencies at Club Sol and Fusion, he was living in Chicago,
working as the Promotional Director of Dust Traxx, Inc. and the fourteen
record labels that they press and distribute. Tommie also branched out
into studio work with collaborators Chris Brann of Wamdue Project, Mark
Verbos, and Felix Da Housecat. New York collaborations have included
Princess Superstar, DJ Hell and James Murphy (dfa/lcd Soundsystem). The
first release on Tommie''s label Xylophone Jones Records was released last
Spring and is Tommie alongside Chris Brann as Jackass & Mule. This record
also had remixes from Adult and Selway. Tommie and Mark Verbos (Binge &
Purge) have a full length titled "Wait, It''s Fantastic!" on Mental Groove
Records in Switzerland.

As a member of Thee Maddkatt Courtship, Tommie co-produced "Cosmic Pop"  
for ffrr/London Records and worked with Felix again, this time with Miss
Kittin of France as Kitten & Thee Glitz on new tracks for their award
winning full-length album on Emperor Norton. The single "Silver Screen
(Shower Scene)" continues to dominate club charts around the world a year
after release. The duo are now back in the studio again for another album
- Thee Courtship Of Devon Dazzle due for release next year.

Tommie is presently working on his first solo album with an all-star cast

....CHILD OF GAIA.... 

Your soul is lush and exploding with life.  Children of Gaia are driven to
sustain themselves and those around them with love.  Equipped with a
methodical and humanitarian heart you can accomplish any task and glean
the best results from it.

Being so attached to “your view” of nature and order can cause you to
create your own reality.  As a member of the cosmic race who makes worlds
real, it is good to believe in a greater plan beyond your own.  Stay aware
of your weakness.

Going with your heart is the key in this existence. You will always be
doing the right thing if you are being natural. Remember, you have
everything you will ever need at all times.  You are a physical expression
of the divine.

-Mickey Finn - london, UK - Jungle - Urban Takeover

Mickey started DJing in the late eighties and became well known with the 
advent of the Acid House movement in South London. He was given the name 
Mickey Finn because of his build by mates and friends in the scene. In the 
early nineties breakbeat and loose jungle techno was filling his record 
boxes as he travelled the length and breadth oh the UK. Such was the 
demand for his skills at this time by huge events all around the country 
he was even strarting to catch private planes between gigs. Mickey's 
production talents started off with Biting Back - She's Breaking Up then 
partnered Gavin and Claudio for Urban Shakedown - Some Justice. Now in the 
late nineties Mickey travels the world and throws down his vibe in 
countries like Japan, USA, Australia, Holland, Ibiza, Germany, Finland, 
Israel and France to name just a few.
Being at the helm of the UK drum and bass phenomenon means his record bags 
are full of the most upfront dubplates and latest releases from producers 
all around the world.

-Dioptrics w/ Ariel - DnB - DC area - www.focalpoint.to

It was 1997 when Ariel was exposed to Jungle/Drum n' Bass and the 
Minneapolis rave scene. 3D, Snuggles, Danny tha Wildchild, Slack, and 
Casper just name a few, were DJs out of the Chicago scene that influenced 
Ariel into DJing himself. He was officially hooked on the musical style 
known as Jungle/Drum n' Bass.
His sets vary from Progressive, to Ragga, to Hard, to Experimental and 
everything in between, always with some exclusive material of his own and 
always trying to keep his listeners on their toes. Recently he has been 
premiering numerous tracks of his on dub plates and will very soon play 
only on dub plates.
Though exposed to varied degrees of academic electronic music in school, 
Ariel's passion for Drum and Bass has landed him a permanent home in his 
studio where he spends a majority of his time. His style of production 
displays many influences such as UFO!, Aphex Twin, Goldie, Facs, and Klute 
just to name a few. Although writing within the structure of the DnB 
style, Ariel's concept of sound, color, timbre, and form are greatly 
derived from art/academic music. In writing Drum and Bass he is trying to 
achieve an equal blend of urban and artistic sounds, while keeping the 
listener in suspense and of course MOVING!!!


-Soniq Stylz - hard house/breaks - dayton - www.focalpoint.to

For the past eight years, Tim Hayes aka DJ Soniq Stylz has been honing his 
skills in the mid-west club scene, searching for the right combination of 
genres. Finding it in nu-skool breaks and hard house, Soniq is one to look 
for in the future. With several club residencies and main events under his 
belt, he has toured with the likes of Jesse Saunders, Delta 9, DJ Irene, 
DJ Rip, and DJ Kos Soniq also ran his own club night (called Activ8) and a 
series of after parties, featuring the likes of Titonton Duvante, DJ Rip, 
Diggabeats, Tilzs, Tronic, and Kid Entropy. Soniq is now taking his lively 
sets to the nationwide masses, in places like Detriot, Seattle, Texas and 
Chicago. Tim also dabbles in music production under the moniker Flogged 
Dolphin, knocking out local club favorites "Feel The Power", "Weapons", 
and "Bump". Having recently dropped "Just The Messenger", a double CD 
release, he is getting ready to add two new mixes, "Housewrecka v. 4" and 
"Disc Breaks".


-React - techno - cincy/chicago - www.subsonik.com / www.focalpoint.to

React is the driving force behind Subsonik Productions, a crew that has 
brought world class talent and high quality events to Ohio since 1998. 
Also one of the regions leading techno DJ's, his style varies from thought 
provoking minimal techno, to sophisticated tech-house, to floor driving 
techno. React's mixing style and technique is just as eclectic as his 
sound, and ranges from smooth and progressive in nature to a more Detroit 
influenced style of turntablism (tricks, cutting, backspins, etc). React 
has rocked a large number of clubs and parties, with numerous appearances 
in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Columbus, Dayton, his home town of 
Cincinnati, and others. React is currently focusing on 3 turntable mastery 
and 2 x 4 sets with other techno DJ's, in addition to building a studio to 
produce music.


-Mowgli - DnB - cincy - www.focalpoint.to

In over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and Jungle, 
Mowgli has held his ground as a forefather of the sound in the Mid-West. 
Along with Troll, they have been the epitome of excellent DJ's with proper 
knowledge and attitude. As of recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing 
drums and sampling loops. He has equipped artists such as 
A-Sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheads), Dylan & Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), 
MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with these drum breaks. Be sure to 
check out his event CHILLED, every Tuesday at the Bamboo Club in Newport, 
KY.


-Infinite Grey - cincy - house (live Pa) – www.focalpoint.to, 
www.linenoiz.com

John's technique to live performance is different from many live PA's. It 
includes live recording and manipulation of sequences and does not involve 
a computer or master sequencer. Instead, he uses separate sequencers to 
control each instrument (sampler, synthesizer, drum machine) 
independently, which allows for a degree of live improvisation. Because he 
produces and remixes material live, every performance is a unique 
experience. Over the past 3 years John has played at some of the largest 
parties and clubs around Ohio.


-Kenya DuBois - portland, OR - downtempo/trip-hop – www.focalpoint.to, 
Adore Recordings, Minus Two Crew

existence. As a Producer and Sound Designer, Kenya nurtures the
elements of ambience and atmosphere in his compositions with a diverse
catalogue of tones, frequencies and exploited daydreamed sounds. A mood
provoking and unique mixture of ambient textures and minimal beats
compliments his cerebral style of composing. Often inspired by the
overture of silence, Kenya expresses musically his vision of artistic
storytelling. Founder of Adore Recordings and Distorted Grooves and half
of the epiphanic collaborative, Popularity Contest Committee, Kenya
DuBois is an Ambassador of the atmospheric state of mind.

significant, whether it be to an event, a person, or a moment. So open

-Oompaloompa - trance - cincy - Airplane Clique/ GSP Entertainment

Joshua Perry aka Oompa Loompa, has been a recognized force in the Midwest 
for nearly 3 years now. The Epic/Anthem/Hard Trance style Oompa Loompa 
brings to the tables have provided the masses of the mid-west with lasting 
memories of an epic journey worthy of Willy Wonka himself.

of Trance's fastest rising stars, Joshua has begun working on his 3rd 
release "Gobstoppers" which will include his original track I'm your dj

-CatNap - triphop/ jazz - columbus - mechaproductions

Catnap held residencies from New York City to London UK in the late 90's,
and has made his mark on Ohio's rave and club scenes since moving to
Columbus in 2000. He is known for a style that is very eclectic but always
a mix of gritty breakbeats, retro sounds, and jazzy textures. His newest
DJ mix, "Rendez-Vous", mixes instrumental hiphop with jazz, lounge, and
world music in the same vein as Mark Farina's "Mushroom Jazz" series.
Original tracks by Catnap will also be featured on GrooveReactor Records'
upcoming compilation, to be released in January.


-Phrenzy - DnB -rokitlabs.com - djphrenzy.com / www.GrooveReactor.com

Steve Gillson exited the womb wearing a set of Sennheisers, but it wasn't 
until late 1996 that he discovered his alter ego, DJ Phrenzy. After 
quickly adapting his musical knowledge to the art of performance, he 
garnered several residencies in Southern Ohio and joined forces with 
Groove Reactor Records. Since then Phrenzy has been lurking in the shadows 
of the midwest, making rare public appearances alongside the likes of 
Dieselboy to Darude. Phrenzy steps to the decks with a unique blend of 
harmonic euphony and technical precision that always moves the crowd. 
Don't miss this opportunity to witness a musical purist in action.


- Robotnik - jungle/ragga - Steel Arm Records - Kokomo, IN

An old Jungle soldier in the Ragga trenches since late 94, Robotnik was 
brought up on a steady diet of beats from such old skoolers as UFO!, 3D, 
and R.A.W. this newly revitalized Ragga Mercenary turned DJ will step to 
the decks for his premier after giving up his dues and working it to the 
fullest to fuse the new rising Ragga sound with the old dark hard Jungle 
of yesteryear gone by. This soldier will kill heads and murder a 
soundsystem all while smoking a spliff he probably found in one of his 
nappy dreads. Ragga Not Dead!


-ADubzz - turntableism - cincy - www.basisproductions.com

With his superb scratching skillz mixed with the best ol' school and 
recent hip-hop and DnB tracks, Adam's calm demeanor is not to be mistaken

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

Jul 16-18                         TEKNIVAL                     Toronto area

Calling all Soundsystems! 

The Toronto Freetekno community will be collaborating once again to 
generate a 2004 teknival. From July 16 to 18 a quiet patch of Ontario 
crown land will become a temporary musical playground for anyone and 
everyone with ears. The event will of course be 100% free. People can show 
up as early as they'd like (some crews may be showing up as early as july 
9) and stay as long as they'd like, until the last partier hits the 
ground. 

ANY and ALL Soundsystems are invited to come set up camp and Jam along 
side the bizarre collection of deranged Torontonians that has come to be 
known as freeteknotoronto. Even if you've never thrown a jam before, feel 
free to get a crew together and set up a stage. You've got the knowlege of 
some seasoned veterans to draw from. Last year we were lucky to be joined 
by collectives from across Ontario, from Quebec and from New York. This 
year promises to be bigger, harder, ect. ect. 

A release of pre-flyers will be circulating in Toronto by mid March. 
We would like an idea of how many stages will be represented this year, so 
if you plan on coming and would like to be included please contact us with 
a YES/NO/MAYBE by the first week in March. More informative flyers should 
hit the street by June 1. If you would like a write-up to appear in these 
flyers, please let us know. 

Also feel free to design your own teknival flyer or web graphic to 
send around to your crew/city/whatever. There's already 3 collectives in 
toronto working on separate designs, reps from other cities are ideal. 
Teknival is a decentralized non-hierarchical event meaning no one person 
or system plans it. It also means that if someone doesn't make it happen, 
it won't. Take it into your own hands and make this event the event you 
want it to be. 

Teknival Sound System Email List: 
If you'd like to be in the loop on the planning process and have your 
say or whatever just email this address and recieve all the communique's 
between systems.

Cycle World International Motorcycle Show in Ohio

this is being held at the IX Center Jan. 30-Feb.1st. Adult admission is 
$11, and child admission is $5. The shows hours are as follows... friday 
4pm-9pm, saturday 9am-9pm, and sunday 9:30am-5pm. If you have any more 
questions, you can visit our website at www.motorcycleshows.com

=========================================================================

I wanted to give the list a heads up on an event I and a number of other
people are through in April 23rd through 25th.  It's called Notacon and
the purpose is to explore technology, art, music and hopefully find some
synergy between them.  This is not party, not a rave nor is it a hacker
convetion, computer convetion or anything else of the sort.  However, it
may have elements of all of these and more.

We're currently seeking artists, performers and DJs who do unusual and
groundbreaking work to showcase their talent and art for our event.  We're
also inviting interested parties to attend the event.

For more information, including our call for proposals, please check out
our webpage:

http://www.notacon.org/

I have the opportunity to pick up a huge lot of amiga hardware and software

I know that alot of you music geeks crave these guys, they are likely fully 
loaded scientific computing machines.  Is there any interest in them?

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Weapons of Mis-Information

http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&b=24970

In the latest round of conservative three-card-monty (also known as "if we say it enough, you'll
believe it"), the White House is now claiming that they never said Iraq or Hussein was an "imminent"
threat...claiming instead that "Some in the media have chosen to use the word 'imminent'. Those were
not words we used." (White House spokesman Scott McClellan)

The Center for American Progress, who obviously get paid to have a lot of free time on their hands,
retort with a hearty "Liar Liar Pants on Fire!" and have counted the number of times Heir President
and his cronies made that exact quote and paraphrases of it over the past year or so and listed
them.

Oodles of fun reading!

Oh, and for all y'all who love to bash these "left leaning" news outlets as making up information,
these are DIRECT QUOTES. So chew on it. Your boy and his pals are straight-up liars. End of f-ing
story.

I've been contemplating going to this for a few years now...hopefully if
my financial situation improves by then, I'll be able to afford to go this
year. We'll see, though... }}

Well, as far as finances go, the earlier you book the better. The prices go
from $165 to $250 depending on when go get tickets... so... a hundred bucks
isn't huge, but it's substantial.

Where have you been hiding, anyway? Drop me a line, would'ya?

If you work until 10pm all the time and can't be here until later let me know. If you really want to come out for a slot I'll sign you up for later in the night. It can't happen all the time, but in all fairness you should be able to get a slot even though you can't be here before 9pm. Just trying to work everyone in. Let me know if you want a slot. And yes, try to bring needles.
 
Thanks,
N

ehh... I'll wait on the dj part, still don't think I'm good enough to play 
anywhere in public :)  Still doesn't stop me from coming in to listen, just a 
little tired today so i'm out for tonight.  Try to get some extra sleep so I 
can go next week though :)

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} MP3 quality?

I'd be interested to hear the difference when encoded in LAME then.
Y'know, the difference, even using SoundForge, is so minimal that this
much debate over it is silly.  You'll see what I mean - I'm uploading a
WAV and an MP3 right now.

LAME is a much better encoder to the Fraunhaufer used by SoundForge.
In comparison, yes... SF mp3 encoding IS shit.

Real has a player called the RealOne Enterprise Desktop and it lacks the
bloat of the regular player and is a free download on their site.  Plus,
there are several third party players that do "everything".

I couldn't stand the regular Real either.

I simpily will not order from a site that uses real audio clips.  I have

gone 3 months now without loading that stoopid program on my computer 
and  I am doing just fine without it.

I'm checkin this shit out though, sounds interesting.

Good enough reason indeed! It's a FAMILY THANG! Here's more on Austin Leeds
for those who missed the info the first time:

FIVE BUCKS for all this and heaven, too:

Austin Leeds (from Discogs.com -- he's done even more phat shit since this
was written)
     With releases with labels such as Bedrock, Zone UK and Bliss, plus
inclusion on numerous compilations his reputation is growing rapidly. Austin
has had studio collaborations with well known artists and DJ's including
Jimmy Van M, Cass & Slide, Mara, Deep Funk Project, Innate, Nu-breed, and
Origin. Regular inclusion of Leeds's tracks on major DJ releases by the
likes of Deep Dish and Sasha & Digweed provide further testimony to his
stylish productions.
     As a DJ Austin's technical ability and flawless programming rank him
among the best, his sets being renowned for their seamless integration of
deep, driving baselines and swirling atmospherics, luring the crowd into a
hypnotic frenzy. Austin has played some of the biggest and best clubs and
parties in Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, New Zealand, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Mexico, England, Belgium, Lithuiania, and the USA and he keeps
adding destinations to his list.
     Following a hectic schedule around the Miami Winter Music Conference,
Austin is staying at home in Florida before returning to London in mid July,
for a month of work in and around Europe. Recently Austin was the guest DJ
on John Digweed's Kiss FM Show, which played an exclusive 1 hour mix of a
recent set. Projects Last year Austin teamed up with Martin Accorsi to
deliver a dark techy remix of Pappa & Gilbey: Twisted for Florida based
label Inversus.
    Austin has other tracks forthcoming on Inversus including Lorient:
Salvation (With Natious), Rock: Resistance (With Origin), and ASAN: 1969, he
also has an EP coming out on SAW recordings as 21st Century Fux well as
remixes under that name. Collaborations with some of Australia's coolest
Underground producers will see Austin Leeds name on future releases from
amongst others Zero Tolerance and Thunk Recordings.
     For recent compilation inclusion seek out Anthony Pappa's new mix CD
Resolutions (React) in stores worldwide now, the tracks "Bala" and "The
Stand", and Mara "Computer Beats" were both collaborations written by Austin
Leeds featuring on the album. Austin has recently started his own record
label Hamachi Records. The first release is a song featuring himself and
Australian Trio Nubreed.

See you at Abbasso next Friday Feb 6!!!!

RealAlternative is the way to go.

Pick up Quicktime Alternative while you're at it.


Basically, it just installs the codecs you need to play those files (and 
you can then play them in most media players).

Also, QTAlt comes with "Media Player Classic", which is similiar to 
Windows Media Player version 2.0: really small and quick, and handy for 
playing rm and mov.

You can get em both here:

http://home.hccnet.nl/h.edskes/mirror.htm


HIGHLY recommended.

Right click - Save as, please.  

These were recorded off my Technics 1200M3D with an Ortofon Nightclub
spherical stylus through a Vestax PMC-270A mixer and into a Creative
Audigy and normalized to -12dB using SoundForge 6.0.  The WAV is 44Hz
stereo and the MP3 is the same and also from the original source but
encoded in 320k MP3.

These were recorded off my Technics 1200M3D with an Ortofon Nightclub
spherical stylus through a Vestax PMC-270A mixer and into a Creative
Audigy and normalized to -12dB using SoundForge 6.0.  The WAV is 44Hz

I don't have the ub3r headphones handy, but this really isn't fair unless
you spill your encoder settings, it looks like you have some sort of 16khz
cutoff, which is adjustable. Another setting people don't often touch (but
should) is their encoder quality setting, etc.

So, spill your encoder quality setting, stereo mode, frequency cutoff, etc.
Bit rate doesn't tell a whole lot.

It'd be easier if you'd have analyzed a few seconds of audio instead.

To actually be REALLY fair, I think you'd want to generate test tones and
encode them.

If you really don't feel like doing that work, check this out:

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} MP3 quality? (WAV vs. 320k files uploaded)

The 16Khz cutoff was a shock to me when I saw it.  I will fix that in
future tracks but the difference (to my ears) is negligible.

Umm...that is all fine and dandy but I don't care that much.  I know the
biggest difference between the two file types is by far....file size.

If someone else wants to encode my WAV file to prove this point over
that point have at it.  In fact, if anyone wants to bring some fresh
limes over you can use my equipment all night and I'll make the
martinis.

Maybe I'm confused about this, but if I'm registered as a republican, does 
that basically mean I have to vote for bush and I can't vote for any of the 
democratic candidates?  If I remember last primaries, if your a republican, 
you only get republican people to pick from, same thing for democrats, and 
then independents are screwed .

Well if you're registered to a party, you get to vote in that party's
primary.  You don't get to vote in other party's primaries though.  So yes
if you're an independent, you don't get to pick who will face bush, you
have to register as a democrat to do that.

But no matter what you're registered as you can vote for whoever you want
in the general election.

Yes, as far as I understand, if you've not previously declared, the vote you cast this Primary will decide your party affiliation. If you've alread affiliated yourself with a party at a previous Primary, you have to register your new affiliation through the voter registration process. Might want to call the Elections board to be sure, though. Cuyahoga County Board of Elections: 216.443.3200

If you're registered Republican, why would you even THINK about voting for

Well, I guess the best reason I could think of is the following scenario:

[Disclaimer: I'm not suggesting that anyone in the Republican party would actually do this. This is
merely a hypothetical situation and given the circumstances, putting it in the terms of the present
election year illustrates my point pretty clearly.]

George Bush is the incumbent. No Republican is going to run against him in 2004. Thus, there's not a
heap of need for Republicans to vote in the primaries.

Say a Republican voter wants to take his/her vote and screw with the Democratic party by voting for
someone wholly unelectable Democrat in the primary...say for instance Al Sharpton, who would be
widely regarded as a really bad presidential candidate and would be projected to lose MISERABLY in
the general election.

Well, what if a whole slew of Republicans (by voting Democrat in a primary) saw to it that Sharpton
got the most Democratic delegates and got the candidacy? It could be considered some form of
"rigging" an election for their candidate based on the fact that they pretty much KNOW that the
general public wouldn't elect said Democratic candidate.


That would be the easiest thing I could think of that these regulations protect against. Again, not
saying it would happen, but it could.

Here's the problem, poor people and young people generally don't vote as
much as wealthy and old people do.  So if you "stay neutral" really you
are just letting the vote of someone old and wealthy stay uncontested,
because they are voting for policies that benefit them, not you.  Most
politicians, both dem and repub alike are probably more conservative than
you, but they really do have different political ideologies.

So if you think your vote doesn't matter, that's not true.  you can at
LEAST think that it's cancelling out the vote of some rich, old person who
could give a fuck less about you or your life, or your children's lives.

Even if they are all corrupt, it's still better to have the lesser of two
evils in office.

If you want to stay ignorant, so be it, but don't wonder why the rich get
richer and the middle class slowly disappears, when you had the power to
make an infinitessimal, small, tiny, but still, a difference.

That's a good point.  Shouldn't there be a liberatarian, german workers' 
party, tree hugger coalition, etc primary as well?  Why is the system 
limited to 2 parties.

Although, it could be said, that these other minor parties can select their 
own candidates by staging other elections.  BUT, then these wouldn't be 
official "primaries"

I wonder if they choose to maintain this system to try to pigeonhole voters 
into a party.

Well, I thought I was, then bush got in office and I saw the err of my ways.  
Although I think I am technically a republican if I understand the basic 
difference is that democrats are for bigger governmental powers and 
republicans want more "power to the people" (i.e. like how bush wanted people 
to invest social security stuff themselves instead of the government handling 
it)  Although the way he's doing all these patriot acts and stuff, I'm

Well, then in that case, you dems better pick a good one, can't really say who

I'm not letting anyone down because I choose to stay away from picking
sides. I've seen both sides offer something great to the United States which
was I decided to be neutral. It doesn't bother me, so I don't honestly
seeing it bother anyone else at all. I never said I wasn't going to vote,
even though I hate doing it. I just tend to look at all the facts before I
really go vote...

And me saying "I don't believe any of them fools because they're all lies"
was just a statement on how I feel about the whole voting thing period. I
also believe that everyone of those guys trying to get voted in, has atleast
lied to make himself look good on the voting status in each state. I don't
believe one bit that any of them hold up to everything they say. Which is
another reason why I choose to be right where I am.

> because they are voting for policies that benefit them, not you.

Doesn't everyone vote for what benefits themselves these days? I'm sure
there's only a few out there that actually think about the entire country
when they vote, but seriously....  I believe majority of the States vote for
themselves.

And I honestly understand what you are saying here. I never said I wasn't
going to vote, but I did say I don't choose sides period.

I've never wondered why the rich get richer, and the poor just sinks.
Everyone has the power. They just lack using it and THAT my friend is being
ignorant.

Well, really, to speak in "-ism's"

Traditionally liberalism seeks self-government on matters of personal
choice, civil liberties, basic rights and responsibilities stuff, while they
seek to govern on matters of economics and so-called public programs. This
is why the poor advocate liberalism - personal freedom is all they have.

Conservativism on the other hand tends to seek self-government on matters of
economics and does have restraints on the growth of government, but its
strong moral conviction intrudes upon the personal freedoms of common people
because it views their potentially bad choices to be detrimental to society.
This is why the wealthy advocate conservativism - they want the freedom to
manage their own money and have no need for the protection of deviants whose
freewheeling antics would only undermine the establishment which has made
them rich.

Hollywood is different, though. Hollywood is very wealthy, but it pushes a
liberal agenda because the creative energy that fuels entertainment is by
its very nature deviant.

It's not bullshit. You could easily undermine a strong candidate in the
opposing party by electing the weaker ones in the primaries and then running
over the top of them in the general elections.

Although, I guess then everyone should register in the opposing party.
Whatever.

like i said before, my main gripe is that independants cant vote 
in primaries. if they made it that they could, i bet lots of 
people would drop their political affiliation altogether.

You don't have to register as a particular party to vote in its primary.
Last election, I went to the primaries and voted for John McCain (hoping
he'd beat Bush), but all I had to do was "declare" a party affiliation.
ANY party affiliation. I could have declared Communist if I'd wanted.

wow, we agree on something. dont you get an "official" primary if 
your party receives the federal matching funds in the presidential 
election? i vaguely remember there being a big primary thing in 
perot's party but it might not have been from the vote at the same 
time as the dems and repubs. 

and yeah, if i cared id obviously be changing to dem so i could 
vote in the primary. im sure alot of people (especially on the 
liberal side) register dem just for instances like that.

When I voted for McCain in 2000's primaries, there was a guy there who
said he was independent and they made him pick an actual party in order to
cast his vote. He was like, "Oh, okay, um, how about Libertarian, then?"
That seemed to surprise the little old lady working the polls. "Oh my,"
she said, "You're our first Libertarian all day!"

I'd be interested for sure!  I did visuals for the first 2 420 parties
with a couple of them and a toster ;)  I spent a couple years at CCC
west and practically lived in the amiga lab there.  I wonder if I can
even remember how to use that shell, its been so long.

See if you can get:
