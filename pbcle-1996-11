once you are on 11th ave, go west for 1/2 mile.  just before the 1st light
you will see a railroad bridge, and before that are several empty parking
lots to the left.  park there, or if full, there should be plenty of
parking elsewhere nearby, but PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU PARK and be very
respectful of neighbors.  this is not the best area, dont say we didnt 
warn you. 

from the parking lot, the space is a 1/2 block walk.  go under the
railroad bridge to the light which is GRANT ST.  you will see several
warehouises to your LEFT, then walk inside the fenced-in area.  from there
you should see where the space is, in the warehouse furthest SE from the
entrance. 

doors open at 11 PM, and the event will go till about 7 AM.  admission at 
the door is only $7 and we are asking you to bring exact change if you 
can.  costumes are encouraged, and please make sure to dress warm as the 
space is very large and difficult to heat (IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL BE COLD!!)
bring an extra layer of clothing or a blanket just in case.

there is also an unannounced second room of ambient and experimental
music, including a live puppet show by MAD LABS from 12:00 - 1:00, live
ambient/tribal/industrial performace by GAGA, live experimental music by
LANCE DECKER, ambient DJ sets by MIDI SLUT and DREAMCYCLE, and live
performance by WATER TOWER to end the evening. 

smart bar provided by evolve from cincinnati, and vending by j2 (i
think!!). 

finally, DJ aria (carl) will be hosting a free afterhours event at his 
house near OSU campus, at 66 king ave.  more details will be available at

drive safe everyone, remember there are likely to be some winter-like 
conditions on your way here.

first off, i would like to say that i was _really_ looking forward to this
party. i really wanted to hear james pennington, paul johnson, and traxx.
i called the info line and it said that the party would be _20 dollars_.
However, when i got close to the front of hte line, there was a sign taht
said "20 $ in costume, 25$ without" i was shocked, but i did pay it.

*thwapping herself repeatedly*

once inside, things looked like they were going smoothly (so far)...

the location:

the party was held at the USA skates place on the west side. i like this
location: lotsa room to dance, functioning bathrooms, places to go if you
arent into the music, and lockers to secure your stuff in. suffice to say,
its does the trick; its not a bad spot.  they took out the tables in the
food area so that there was more room. this was nice. however, they tried
to divide the place into two different rooms. they put up a sound curtain
between the main "skating area" and a smaller set near the skee ball
tables. also, they had a huge platform set up in the middle of this area;
it took up a LOT of space that people could have been dancing in.  this
made this area very tiny and it was stuck in a little corner!  the sound
was adequate, but the sound curtain was very ineffective; there was a lot
of bleeding.

the main room was set up quite differently than at the smile tour. they did
not make use of the dj booth that the skating place already has. i assume
that this is b/c they wanted to redirect the sound in the same direction
that the sound in the smaller room was so as not to overpower the smaller
sound system. the lights were done by eyegasm and centrak (?) -well the
flyer says thunder and lightening, but i am not sure..i know that
chip/eyegasm was working it, so who knows who it was! well anyways, the
lights were very nice, as usual. the main system was very loud, and it was
painful to be in the very front of the speakers. but it wasnt terribly
distorted or bass-y or anything like that, just a little too loud for my
liking. i like to be able to painlessly dance in front of hte speakers for
long periods of tiem, and here, i could not do that.

the lineup:

what lineup??!!! what a fucking joke. first i would like to say that the
main reason i went to this party was to hear paul johnson, suburban knight,
and traxx. THREE of the headliners did not show up: paul johnson, traxx,
and josh !!! not only was there NO cohesive lineup in either room, but
there were no signs or anything anywhere saying that these HEADlining djs
would NOT be there. furthermore, i feel that it was extremely greedy and
deceptive that the voicemail claimed that the party was $20, and it was
really $25 (there were only a small amount of kids that came in
costume)---AND there was NO effort to make retribution for the fact that
the three headliners were not there. they could have at least put up a sign
of warning/apology outside next to the *$25* ticket price! had i known that
these djs were not there, i might have turned around, got back in my car,
went home and danced to my own friggin mixtapes, instead of putting money
in their greedy pockets. to reinforce my point that we were ripped off i
would like to add that there were only 4 other out of town djs: two from
pittsburgh (sine and saint), one from chicago (mystic bill), and one from
detroit (suburban knight)....come on now spawntaneous, was it _that_
necessary to charge $25 ?!

the djs:

i mainly spent my time in the jungle area...
_saint_: he played some nice tracks, his mixing wasnt all that great, but
thats okay, i still had fun :)
_sine_: i have only heard him one other time, and i really like the d&b
that he spins.  one of the only good things about this party was that he
played that one jugnle song that goes "i need a woman who can roll with
me..." or soemthign like that; can anyone ID that song for me?? thanx.

	***here is another interruption in the flow of this party

after saint and sine, all of the music in thejungle area was stopped for
abou 45 minutes as the ppl from spawntaneous fucked around with the
equipment trying to get swamp and/or funkian tribe set up. the big platform
that i mentioned earlier was going to be used for funkian tribe. while it
looked like they were settting up for swamp, they were doing a sound check
for funkian tribe. all the while, we all stood around like morons waiting
to see who the heck was going to go on next...no one seemed to know :P

finally, after about 45 min i got tired of waiting and went in the main room...

in the main room:

_mike sparks_: missed most of his set besides the bleed that we were
getting in the jungle area *arrggghhh*
_gank_: as usual, played on that harder detroity tip; not as tight as i
have heard him before. actually, i was quite surprised that his mixing was
not very good considering he is usually pretty on.
_mystic bill_: blaaaahhh...i've heard him too much in the mw/chi area.
boring house. although after standing around in the jungle area waiting for
them to get their shit together, he was a nice relief to just get some
basic fourfour steps in ;) got bored with him and went to see if
swamp/funkian tribe was on yet.

in the other room, i discovered swamp ripping shit up as usual. this guy
does some absolutely crazy shit. i saw him at 720, and i was right in front
of the tables with my jaw hanging down to the ground. this time tho, since
i was comign in late, everyone was crowded around the tables, you couldnt
get within 20 feet of the tables. not only that, but there were people
standing on the platform trying to get a peak, people crowding the skee
ball stands as well as people in the main room hanging over the sound wall
trying to look over!! i couldnt see a thing and i had already seen him once
before, so i chilled in the back for a lil, then went into the main room.
also, i really dont think listening to swamp is quite as good as actually
seeing how he is making those sounds! its really not very danceable (unless
you are breaking) and so, sticking around to "listen" really isnt anything
without the visuals...so i left =P

in the main room, mystic bill was *still on* i swear he spun forever!
toward the end of his set, he played the second good thing about my night:
god within's "the phoenix". i love that song. it reminds me a certain
guitar-in-techno liking individual ;)

after mystic bill finally got off the tables, funkian tribe came on . this
i did not understand! but wahtever...i left to go hear tik tak spinning in
the jungle area. tik tak is so enthusiastic about his records you just cant
help smiling when he is spinning. i find that he often plays alot of hte
same records over and over again, but i recently heard that all of his
records and tables got stolen for the *second* time. that is just horrible.
*sigh* ahhh welll...so i danced for a while to tiktak until it was about
tiem for me to go home ( i had to work in the morning). resigned to the
fact that i was going to miss suburban knight and traxx (i had already
heard that PJ was not going to be there)...i went into the main room for
one last time assuming that (according to murphy's law) right as i was
leaving, james pennington was going to go on..and of course he did...i
heard the first few tracks, and had ot pull myself away to go home. oh
well.


overall this party was a major disappointment for me. i thought that the
original lineup was pretty good (for a cleveland event! ;) and was looking
forward to it. now, i am just bitter and disappointed that i got ripped
off, and that i paid that god awful price for basically nothing! i think it
is really shitty that in a scene as small as clevelands, the kind of
deception that went on with this party is tolerated!  perhaps it is my own
naivete that makes the whole situation problematic to me. i guess i just
have this ideal that even tho i dont know these promoters personally, that
they are trying to bring a service to our "raver community", and when they
dick us over like that, it almost seems as though friends are being dicked
over by friends. to knowingly deceive a bunch of kids into paying $25 for a
party of that calibur is absolutely absurd and just plain wrong. *shrug*
but i guess that is what i get for having expectation and ideals. on the
other hand of it---what kind of ideal do i need?! this is a fucking
business after all, isnt it? if i went to a concert sponsored by
ticketmaster and three of the headliners did not show up, you bet people
are goign to bitch for their money back, or perhaps ticketmaster is even
going to lower the price and give something back to us for the promoters
fuckup. i know that is a exaggerated and crude example, but look around:
parties are a _business_, and i am an unsatisfied customer.

parties are risks, when i go and pay my hardearned $10-25 dollars on one
night, i am taking a risk and i am putting that money out for good. yet, i
think that we are shifting away (heck, we've _been_ shifted!) from those
riskier parties towards highly legitimate business-like run parties, i.e
contracts, high-cost and quality sound and lights, full permits, security
and staff, and even higher quality venues such as concert clubs and
USAskates :P   and because of this, i also expect somethign in return. and
when what the promoters have _promised_ is failed to be delivered, you bet
i am going to be upset!

so what can we do about this?!
i KNOW i am not the only one who is dissatisified and frankly, very pissed
off about what went on last weekend. it wasnt even MENTioned on this list!
so if you went to this party and are pissed (or if you _arent_ pissed),
stand up and speak up!!! lets eradicate this apathy that i have seen over
and over again in this city.

***i encourage anyone who is dissatisfied to CALL THE INFO LINE and tell
them what you think!! (spawntaneous productions: 216.779.7188)

***tell your friends who went to CALL THE INFO LINE!

***dont support people who dick you over! (monetarily or otherwise)

this is the first time that i have called an info line and intelligently
told them what was so disappointing about their party and why i think i was
ripped off. granted, they probably dont give a shit and nothing will change
_them_ because of it, but if enough people STOP TOLERATING this shit, then
they wont be able to throw parties anymore. i said it once and i will say
it again, lets get rid of this apathy here. empower yourself, speak out,
and dont support shitty promotors!

hrmph. i think that is all i have to say.

oh, one more thing. at least they did ONE thing right with this party: the
name!  i could just about kill myself for putting money in their pockets to
begin with.


love and cavatellis,

kate O+

Whle I was waiting for Jungle to go mainstream I was bieng distracted by the 
other sounds in my scene such as:  Slow Breaks
                                                   Happy Hardcore
                                                   Trip Hop
                                                   & Acid House


Well was I dissapointed when I found in every Pop/Culture Mag from "PAPER" to

to "VIBE" had an article about TRICKY.   It was just recently that I learned
what 
kind of music TRICKY made and boy was I ever suprised to find out it was Acidic 
Triphop.   Not only this but Vibe is guessing that Jungle and Hip-hop's  
daughter Is going to be big this year.  From Bjork&Goldie to Everthing But The 
Girl to TRICK and Ghostown DJ's(my boo).


I don't want no SLACK fo' this letta.

I would though like to hear anyone else's input.

Personally, i think the way that drum and bass and hiphop have been
going is getting really played out (don't get me wrong, i like a good
method man sample dropped correctly in a track as much as the next
persson, but it gets old after a while).  However, i haven't heard too
many drum and bass tunes that were made with the help of a hip hop
artist.  those that I have heard (can't think of them offhand) haven't
been all that, but it's a relatively new things with not many examples. 
I have heard drum and bass tracks with dnb MC's (like actually recorded
on the track, ie The Western, and F-Jam vocal mix) which I think work
quite well, but that technically "hiphop" and drum and bass, if you ask
me.

basically, i think it'll be a long while before all the hip hop kids in
the states pick up on dnb but i could see it happening if like the RZA
and Wu teamed up with say, SS or Hype/Zinc and made an album...

earache sed:
=================================================================
Hannah, the queen sister of Ecstatic Music, got punched by this bitch
FLOWER because Hannah wouldn't let FLOWER in for free.  FLOWER somehow
thought that since she had been going to parties for SO LONG that SHE HAD A
RIGHT to get in FREE.  Hannah disagreed and FLOWER punched her and anothe
ecstatic sweeite, Jessie.
================================================================= 

there is however nothing more wack and more greedy than being told
u'd be put on a guest list for helping out with the party and then
only to be stuck @ door cuz the damn door girl/dude can't find u
on the list cuz the promotor wuz really a greedy bastard and 
basically took u for granted and expects everyone to work for 
free <--- #1 clue u've got a promotor that's in it for the $$$$$.
this promotor is usually the same promotor who ends up not paying
the dj's in full, over-prices the party to begin with, stuffs as
many kids into a space as possible cuz they can give a shit less
about them...i think kate's review pretty much summed up how wack
promotors can be...i think just about all the kids in chicago who
been to enuff partys there know what i'm talking about...bottom
line don't be a fool and support wack promotors that are obviously
only in it for the money!

maybe i'm just a lucky bastard for missing suicide (strange how i
have a knack for missing the wack partys) but i kinda figured when
1st they threw WATCHAMARIPOFF for $15 for a party with only one
out of towner and four local dj's! and then when they intentionally
decided to throw their party the same date as SEVEN BLOWS OF THE
DRAGON when kirsten had planned her party months before ( i feel
really bad for her becuz this will be the 2nd time she had to 
reschedule her party and now won't even be throwing it in cleveland
becuz of all the wackness!)...this is exactly why i wuz reluctant
about posting the line-up for the party until some one asked about
it on pb-cle-raves (i think kate forwarded my line-up post to 
mw-raves anywaze tho)   

on the other hand, spawntaneous has thrown good partys before and
maybe this party was just bad luck...but $25 was definitely too
much for this party especially when one of the headlining dj's
didn't show up...i dunno what spawntaneous has planned for their
party in december but i do hope they become a little less greedy  
and remember how they were when they first started out...when it
wuz about the vibe and not the buck.

on a lighter note...i wuz however wuz impressed with carol and
mike fifer for their new wednesday night out, EARGASM, here in
cleveland.  they were so kind hearted, they decided to let all
the kids in for free this past wednesday...now here are promotors
i'm more than willing to support and bring my friends to.

The info line is 456-BASS in case you want to check this out, but 
anyways, here is the addy for High Evil.

2538 5th Ave in Oakland

The building says M. Stahl Plumbing on the outside. Go down 5th Ave.
heading out of Oakland toward downtown and the building is on the left 
hand side past Craft Ave., before you reach the Birmingham Bridge.  The 
info line suggests that you park in Oakland and walk down to the party 
because there isn't much parking around the area, but the place is right 
on a bus route, for a change.

See y'all there...

What I was trying to say, in the While My Back Was Turned post, was that In
the whole Jungle is going mainstream post, a while back,  it seems that its not.

 but that its spawn, TRIP-HOP, will have many more followers than 2 of its
contributors (Acid & Jungle) in the US.

Not that anyone is going to stop listening to "Method Man", or any of their
other albums, but that  it will have a good influence on the music community.

Just as House is more accepted than HardcoreTechno.

and Ambient more accepted than Acid

Maybe in the near future you will have a Trip-Hop rap artist on the top ten
and not just singers.

Sometimes I think we miss the trip-hop background music because of the rap
song itself.

As for Hip-hop getting played out, its not for all music reinvents itself.

Hey there,

	I have to agree with you Kate.  It was pretty foul for them to 
charge more than they said on the info line, as well as not have some of 
the headliners show up.  Hopefully it was all just a mix up.  I'm also 
really pissed, because at the party someone ganked one of my buttons off 
of my bag.  Oh well, it happens.....BTW.  Does anyone know anything about 
the party coming up in Oberlin, or whatever on the 6th of December?

this isnt a flame and it aint no slack but what i hear is that becuz TRICKY
was being put into so many categories, which most musicians dont want to be
done,  he for the sake of his own reputation came out with a new album
which attempts to break any trends he was setting himself up as..

        im no expert on his music and wouldnt know how to expain it to you,
but i think he would like it better that for once someone called him by
name not by genre..I just want to say that i respect this..
many great artists dislike being misinterpreted...tricky is tricky..*shrug*

ps. new skool electro/breaks, trip hop, acid jazz, trance, acid house, etc
etc...they all are interconnected; if someone wrote that tricky was acidic
triphoppish...does that really tell you anything? doesnt tell me shit.

ignore my unproductive ramblings if you want...heh

Don't read media that generalizes music. 

Tricky's "Maxinquaye" takes raw sexual energy and transforms it into a
disc that is perfect for post-party unwinding or amorous encounter. But
his next two releases were quite different. In particular, there is the
album that includes musical guests that include bjork and some other
mainstreamers... 

If going mainstream is his attempt to not be classified,
I don't think th elogic flows. If he is making music based on what the
media say about him, that is lame as hell, but I doubt that is what he is
doing. I think he just likes to experiment musically.

Anyone know of others with the Tricky sound?

i was there!!!  i think i was doint the exact same thing to swamp...and tik
tak was fun to watch too..you said that tik tak play the same record over
and over agian..yeah but when i saw him at 720 he never let a track play
for more than a minute...and those blind scratches that he does while hes
bending over grabbing the next rekkid are phat..hes got some skillz.
sine spun there as well 412 representin..that was my first cleveland party
and i like it a lot...havent been back since tho..

didnt someone say that that was the last party spawntaneous was throwing? i
think it was posted on pb-cle; thats why they called it suicide right?
personally i had bad vibes from that from the get go..if a group with a
decent rep is throwing their last production with that name,  chances are
they gonna dick people over, especially if they like working with
ticketmaster.

just my two cents

ART FOR ART'S SAKE yo..
ever heard of this?
if you happen to make stuff people like: SELL IT
but make it first. and make it for yourself..

i didnt read this from media.. my knowledge is from my experiences with
other kewl kids and listening to the music. i never attempted this to start
a another endless commerciallism bullshit no way out argument...you and i
both realize that tricky isnt sticking to one genre.
how did i ever say this was an attempt to go mainstram?
what?

all i said was he, like many artists dont like to be classified and
misinterpreted...he doesnt fit into any mold and i think he wants to prove
that.. is that so wrong?
i dig him..

oh and ive heard tricky been compared to portishead; i dont remeber why..i
think it has something to do with the vibe more than the actual structure
and sound of the music.
on that tip i would compare him also to aphex twin
by means of funky tweaked out beats and drones.. i dont really know if
tricky experiments wth drones though..

anywayz peace.. and  lets please not have another discussion about commercialism
unless you read some karl marx and really feel strong about it..
(i recommend learning about Georgia O'Keefes or Picasso's life if you want
to truly respect art for arts sake, not for profit gain)

I remember hearing something (I believe from the list) about that being
their last party, but they're doing another one on December 14th I
think...  Have spawntaneous ever worked with ticketbastard? yuck...

Stevie,

I know that the majority of posts on this subject were negative (ie all of
them), but I wanted to express how good a time I had there.  I would agree
that the price tag was unexpected ($25 v.s. $20 as mentioned on the taped
recording), but it wasn't that big a deal for me.  In fact, I did an
unofficial count three different times during the night and got 500 as the
number of people there each time.  When you do the math and take into
account the rental of the place, lights, sound, advertising and dj costs,
I can't see how this would have been profitable any other way than
charging $20 or $25.  People don't look at the promoters' costs when
talking about the events they go to.  For parties to continue, these
promoters have to make a profit.  More profit means more parties for us.
It's not Europe where thousands and thousands of people show up to every
event.  Here on the North Coast things are different, so the pricing
formula has to be different.

Anyway, I went to Suicide and was very impressed.  I got there at about
1:30 with Margaret (from Poland), and it was definitely alive and shaking. 
Since it was held in a roller skating rink (Ridge and Denison), there
weren't natural breakups for the rooms (ie no walls).  But the hanging
covers that served as a separation did just fine.  I detected little if
any sound bleeding between the smaller stage and the main room. 

The smaller stage was jungle oriented, and since I'm not into this kind of
music, I stayed in the big room.  The lighting was very good and made the
trance experience that much more pleasurable.  From 1:30 until at least
3:00 was some excellent music.  At times it was bordering on
transcendental.  The dj would hold a pattern to the point of hypnotic and
then, suddenly, a TB 303 would emerge and it was like pure bliss.  This
guy really knew what he was doing.  Then it got techno and some absolutely
horrible live act ruined everything (rap or crap or something).  They
should have put this PA on the smaller stage.  In fact, it's possible that
the promoters had meant for this act to be in the other room, but because
they were having problems with the sound system there they switched them
into the main room.  Just a hunch.

This is my opinion, of course, but I think that certain styles of music
should remain throughout the night in the same room.  That way, if I like
GOA (604) or acid trance, I don't have to worry about them changing the
style on me halfway through.  If I like jungle, I should be able to dance
to it uninterrupted for six hours, if that's what I want.  Having lots of
different styles is excellent, but they should all be in the same place
and stay there.  When musical styles change in the same room, it can make
a lot of people unhappy.  It also makes them uneasy if they are into a
certain sound and are worried that it will come to an end soon.

BTW, no one mentioned that crazy woman with the fifteen foot wing span.
What was that about?

Take care,

Braden

    Well, I stopped by the two parties listed here, High Evil and the
ASA shindig, and I was disappointed.  They just didn't live up to the
'burgh standards.

    I'll start with the ASA jig.  It was just bad - the location was OK,
for a house party, but for all the hype that they lumped on "Superstar"
DJ Starchild, he really failed to deliver.  Cutting from one song to the
next (not even beatmatching!!!) and choosing some pretty sketchy toons
just don't cut it, especially not for someone whose resume "check out". 
I left that one pretty quickly.

    On to High Evil - a truly evil location, indeed, in between two
desloately busy streets.  It would have been a really good party, no
doubt, if there had been room enough to dance.  The jungle room, where I
would have stayed, had really good music (even though the DJ I saw was
only mixing during the breakdown sections; kind of poor) but about two
inches to shake the booty I brought.  The downstairs room had more
space, but the guy was mixing hardcore and I can't really stand hardcore
(not to mention that the mixing there was pretty so/so as well).  Also,
there was nowhere to get a drink.  Where did Cafe 2000 go?  Or just a
water fountain?  Seeing as this was the weekend that I was showing a
good friend of mine a true "Pittsburgh Rave", I was a little let down. 
But she wasn't, so it wasn't a total loss.

    Anyhow, props to the light guys, as the visuals at High Evil were
pretty phat.  I think that it was just a bad night for parties in
general.  I'll have to drop by Steel City Jungle and get back into the
swing of things.

                                                            -Ken

I think it's all a matter of opinion, cos I had a rill good time at High
Evil.  Got there early, stayed fairly late...as they say, good to the last
(bass) drop.  :)

   That sounds weird - I was always inpressed with Starchilds ability to
mix non-jungle with jungle...but maybe he's out of practice.

   Anway, there was *tons* of fine fine jungle musik at High Evil - like 3
DJ's I'v never heard spin before, and they each had some cool bassy
tracks, and the one MANIC harstep tune I just had to get a rewind on - I
don't even know who was playing that. And of course killer sets by the
Farmer Tea and Spaed.

The place was a little cramped for dancin'...but there's not much you can
do about that with the spaces available in pgh (hopefully I'll be putting
something together at Pitt, where we have lots of big spaces).

Definatly, that stuff is hard for most people to get into, but i thought
it sounded cool as hell!  Lots of bizzare sounds and throbbing beats -> on
3 turntables none the less.  Book Edgar Ummm... if you can! ;)

Yeah, it could'v been better ..... if everybody dressed up!  I was almost
alone as the King of Skeletons...but mucho props to the big pteradakyl
guy, now THAT was impessive.

Is Steel City still happening at all?  I haven't been down there on a
Tuesday in a while, and I kind of figured it was falling off when only 3
people showed up one week.  For being the 'jungle city', we sure seem to
have problems supporting a club night.

hey sweet cheeks (i.e. Kenneth Flagg)
i saw your post about my playing last night at the asa party.  i just
wanted to say that you need to evaluate an entire situationn before you
judge someone.  i'm starchild by the way.  first, it was crowded as fuck
up in there and so people were bumpin into the table all night and
making the records skip.  thus, when you are beat matching and people
bump into the table it fucks up the mix.  after a while you don't feel
like mixing anymore cause you think that it is going to get fucked up. 
second, i did not always cut in and out of songs.  i know how to beat
match.  if you want a mix tape then i'll give you one and you can see
what some beat matching is.  but for the record, mixing hip-hop ain't
always about beat matching.  if you listen to a lot of hip hop dj's they
will usually just cut into a new song.  and as far as some sketchy tunes
go i think that you need to check yourself.  so before you go puttin
negative comments about someone on a bboard you better think about what
is going on and if YOU could have done better.  i don't think so bitch.
i'm out

	I was hoping somebody could help me out here.  Does anybody know 
if the Saturday or Sunday night DJ's at Trilogy/The Church sell mix tapes 
of their stuff...and if so, where I could get them! Thanks ahead of time, 
I appreciate any help you can give me. :)

    Chris no offense but you need to get off your high horse.  We all
know that spinning at party situations is rough and you have to
compensate.  As far as getting your tables bumped sometimes that's
unovoidable, but last night they were in a bad, open spot.  Considering
the floors were concrete and not wood the skipping should have been bare
minimum.  The far corner would have been an ideal location.  Thus I
think blamming the dj for the skips is a fair criticism in this case.  
    As far as your dj'n went last night it was rather average.  I don't
mean this as a dis, but if your going to promote yourself as Superstar
dj starchild you best deliver.  Yeah you did play some nice tracks but
overall nothing special and most of the mixes were rather plain.  
    As far as ken goes I think you took his comments way too personal. 
If you're going to advertise a house party on the net it should be more
than a normal house party.  the ASA thing  wasn't a rave.  If you
advertise something on the net you also have to be ready for criticism. 
There were some sketchy tunes played last, I have to agree with ken. 
You did play some nice tracks (ie Biggie Smalls), but I heard some wack
ones too.  It's a matter of flavor I guess.  
   To wrap things up, yes, I think ken could have done better and yes he
does know whats's going on.  
BTW name calling is a bit juvenile

'ere's a little review, most of its been said alread ;)

i got there late (~2:30), the music pretty much kicked upstairs the whole 
time I was there (till ~4:30). I really dug the freestyler's ... they where 
phat ;) ... hehe I think there should be more mc's that freestyle during 
jungle sets, instead of the pure hypein of the crowd type mc ...

dowstairs there was more room ... but less people ... it was also a tad
hot upstairs ;) ... the visuals where interesting, the space kicked ...

it was good for da money ... 

peace

Critiquing Djs + parties is one of the *big* functions of this list.
There's no point in keeping it to straight positive coverage, I like to
hear who's good and who's not, that way I can decide what parties/djs to
shell out money for.
Now, I don't want to take you to task, but I do have a few problems with
your comments.
And having gone to both parties (with Ken) I feel his comments were
valid. And even if I didn't agree with them, he still has the right to
make those comments. Quite possibly the gist of the problem was your
selection of music... LL Cool J? I guess we were just expecting
something danceable. About your mixing skills: you could have at least
been segue-ing. The fact that you found it necessary to justify the lack
of mixing seems to indicate to me that you were well aware that you
weren't up to speed. Everyone has a rough night here and there, so don't
take Ken or my comments personally, just do better next time. Oh, and
this is a mailing list, not a bboard.

hey john,
in your last message you wrote:

if your going to promote yourself as Superstar dj starchild you best deliver

...i never have promoted myself as superstar dj starchild and i never
will because i don't think that i can ever be as good as keoki or dmitri
(that was a joke)...that is a tag that people on the mailing list may
have stuck onto my name...i'm not as high on my horse as you might
think....i know what i can and cannot do with two turntables and i know
what other people can do...i've never promoted myself as being the best
hip-hop dj in the world and i never will...hip-hop is a side thing for
me as far as dj'ing goes...it is something that i like to do for house
parties cause i like hip-hop...thus if i am going to be playing at a
house party you are going to here straight hip-hop...most of them will
be what i consider to be party jams...plain and simple.  the same goes
for house...i like to play a deepeer style of house and once in a while
throw in what i think are some of the hits...it's just a house party.

you also said that i took his comments too personal.  to be honest i was
trying not too as much as possible.  i really tried to be objective in
my response.  but as you probably know from doing house parties yourself
john, there's a lot of shit going on that the people dancing don't know
about. at one point our left speakers went out and so while spinning i
also had to direct people as to what to do to try to remedy the
situation.  now as far as criticism goes, my main point is that no one
has the right to crticise unless the they know, not think, that they can
do a better job.  that's my main point.  i've worked hard to get where i
am right now as a jungle dj and so it is hard to not take it personal
when someone criticizes me without any understanding of the
circumstances surrounding the whole situation.

you also mentioned something about advertising on a rave mailing list. 
i never advertised the party on there and i never asked my boys to. 
they did it on their own.  nuff said.

alls i have to say is that all 400+ people crammed into that basement
wouldn't have stuck around if the party and my playing was that bad.  on
that note i will end this litany and extend my apologies to kenneth.  i
did not want to make this a back and forth personal thing.  some of my
comments in my first message may have been unprofessional, and so once
again i apologize.  

don't criticize what you think you know until you've been there and done it.
chris

i don't think so...i think Chris is experienced enough that he didn't
make any mistakes like hitting the tonearm with his sleeve or
whatever...i know that during the party i saw at least 4 or 5 people
bump the tables while Chris was trying to beatmatch...i was watching the
tables MOST of the night, as i was trying to keep people from bumping
them...

>dj starchild you best deliver.  Yeah you did play some nice tracks but
>overall nothing special and most of the mixes were rather plain.  

again, i don't think so...the mixing style was like a lot of hip-hop
DJs...listen to the Funkmaster Flex CD...there are a couple mixes where
he just DROPS into a song...there's a reason for that...when you're at a
hip-hop party, and the energy level is high, you just wanna DROP the
next dope track on 'em...i love it when that happens...plus, as Chris
has told me, most hip-hop songs have vocals right near the start of the
track, so you can't do real long mixes...finally, there were a LOT of
hectic moments going on last night, like the 1/2 hour when we were
trying to fix the speakers that seemed to be blown (someone had bumped
the table and pulled loose a connection on the mixer)...
and as far as the "superstar" DJ thing, Yung put that on the e-flyer,
Chris did NOT and never has promoted himself as such...i hope ya'll
don't think i'm a porn star for REAL :p

by "house party" we meant party in a house...not a party with all
house...i can see where people on this list might think otherwise when
reading it.
that's my bad, i was just all excited about our party and maybe wanted
some of the pb-cle ravers that i know and love :) to show up (big up
Carlo and his crew!)...

yeah, i think that's what the whole music thing comes down to...flavor
and taste.  you don't like broccoli, don't dis the chef who cooks it.

i already responded on the mixing tip...he's been doing fine EVERY
time...i have people on campus coming up to me asking me "when's the
next ASA party?  hah?  hah?"  d'you wanna dis all of them by saying they
don't know what's up? they may not be part of the global dance culture
like you and I (how's the club scene in HK?) but they have _some_ soul...

>Oh, and this is a mailing list, not a bboard.

this is a mailing list that shows up as a bboard on the CMU mail system,
as are a lot of the "bboards" that people post to...that's what happens
with spam, a lot of people don't realize that some people get these
messages in their PERSONAL mail and it takes up space on their
accounts...the mail system even says "BBoards" on it...why are we
talking about this on pb-cle-raves?  

to end, i think ya'll are all up in the Kool-Aid and don't know the
flavor...everybody made valid and invalid points.  heck maybe an
all-campus DJ battle is in order *grin*...

Well, I stand corrected...
the only problem I have left is that this is pb-cle-*raves* which has
less dealing w/ straight hip hop... not that some hip hop flavor is bad,
but full on hip hop w/ vocals is not something I'm really into...

I was expecting a house music party though... it just seemed a bit
commercial/pop to me... oh, and I'm down w/ milli vanilli- they'd make
for some great remixes/samples...

yeah, most of the crowd who shows up for our parties are more or less
"mainstream" and so we have to adjust for their tastes more...we try to
throw in the occasional Ian Pooley/Josh Wink/DJ Rap flavor in there
every once in awhile, but we mostly gotta try and play some more
familiar-sounding stuff for them...

blame it on the rain...

to make things straight:

> If you're going to advertise a house party on the net it should be more

First off, the message that I posted about the party wasn't meant to be
sent to any non-cmu bboards or mailing lists.  I personally sent it only
to CMU bboards and the CMU ASA mailing list.

Second... the party, as all other ASA parties, was meant to be a house
party, not a rave.  (And the original post should not have been re-sent
to a rave mailing list.)  We are not trying to throw raves.

Since the shindig was a house party aimed primarily for the CMU
community, my post (e-flyer) contained many silly lines padding the
stright-forward info (time, date, etc).  I'm sorry that some people took
it so seriously.  Again, it wasn't meant to be advertised on
pb-cle-raves.

Furthermore, Chris should be the last person taking any shit about the
party.  He is basically doing ASA a favor by spinning at our parties,
which have quite a different scene than that of the jungle parties or
raves that he normally spins at.

And finally... the party worked out damn well as it was intended to (as
a house party).  Yes, it did get somewhat hectic with so many people...
space has always been a limited resource that we've had to deal with.
So, ASA parties are not raves (phat house parties, they are), and for
the sole purpose of preventing any future misunderstandings, they will
not be advertised in places where they shouldn't be. (Think about it
first when you decide to re-post the message somewhere!)

That's it for now.

)))CAUTION: LONG ASS POST(((

ok here's my review of darkside 4 (i.e. what i can remember
still):
i liked the warehouse, good atmosphere but i thought it was very
dirty. i was feeling sick the whole time because i have allergies &
the
hi amount of dust made them worse. it's kind of weird though
because that's never happened before, even at dirtier warehouses. 

O O O O   4 blowpop rating 
| | | |   for the warehouse

in the main room, at least, i didn't really get into the music much
until
the jungle (all of which i liked) & when heckle & jeckle went on. i've
found it easier to dance to most things than hardcore which was the
largest amount of music at the party. 

O O O O   4 blowpop rating for
| | | |   decent quality music

those stocking things heckle & jeckle were wearing over their heads
+ the blond wig was some strange costumes; it was eerie when i saw
them first from far away & couldn't tell who they were what was on
their faces. their set was as good as usual with lots of tricks. 

O O O O O   5 blowpop rating for
| | | | |      crazy costumes

this party i think needed more in the way of lights. not lasers or
anything expensive necessarily. i know the minimal ele mental
lighting style & it's cool, cause i don't mean more light by more
equipment but just light in general. it was -way- too dark in the main
room so it was so hard to see who anybody was. but maybe that was
the intended effect (was it?) to add to a halloween atmosphere & to
fit the name.

O O O   3 blowpop rating
| | |     for lights

overall vibe was pretty good, i saw lots of friendly people & no 
mean people.

O O O O O   5 blowpop rating
| | | | |    for good vibe


and i was glad to hear that ed finally made a profit! yay, you deserve
it since i know you've lost lots of $ on previous parties.

O O O O O   5 blowpop rating for the well deserved
| | | | |      profit & the promotional effort


now for a review of proton (i might remember a little more):

the space was great, 2 rooms, wooden dance floor, clean new
carpet, clean bathrooms, not too hot or cold. it seemed like it used
to
be a factory--i noticed there was still some machinery in the rafters
but didn't know what it would have been used for. the only bad thing
was the floor wasn't very stable so whenever anyone danced right in
front of the turntables, the records skipped. 

O O O O (   4 1/2 blowpop rating
| | | | |      for the space


the lineup could have been better. there were only 5 djs & they were
all from ohio (i'd consider the same state "local" territory) except
for
omegaman from detroit & none of them were big names. sleepy-c is
a medium name i think & still more or less local.
for the price of $9 i think they could have had a few more djs of the
same caliber & maybe had ambient and/or house in the other room
or they could have brought in at least 1 big name.

O O (   2 1/2 blowpop rating
| | |     for an ok lineup

i didn't know who was spinning when except i recognized sleepy-c &
i think doughboy. for the most part of what i heard, the mixing &
tracks were fairly solid but nothing too spectacular. at about 3:15
some song came on that i didn't know but apparently everyone else
did because they were all cheering for it. (what is it?) i didn't
understand why; i didn't think it was that good until that hard huge
phat phat bass kicked in! that was the redeeming value of it to me.
and does anybody know who it was that was spinning at maybe 1 or
2 am? whoever it was that went all over the place in styles, playing
hardcore then jungle then trance back to hardcore, throwing in hard
house & jungle here & there. hey make up your mind what you're
going to spin!
either pick 1 style for the set, or have some sort of logical
progression to where you're going with it. if the styles are all
arbitrary
it sounds like shit.

O O (   2 1/2 blowpop rating for overall
| | |   skills (i can't remember each dj)

the lighting was very good for the space, just the right amount & a
LOT of lasers (!!!), red and orange. plus maybe 4 trackspotters (i
think that's what they're called) & some strobes. i brought my bubble
gun & shot bubbles into the lights which looked pretty cool.

O O O O O   5 blowpop rating for
| | | | |     lasers & lights


the vibe was mostly very good & i met lots of friendly people. a lot
of
people told me they liked my pants which made me happy (i sewed
silver sequins on them around the cuffs in this kind of streaked
pattern). they also liked the bubble gun.

O O O O O   5 blowpop rating for
| | | | |      a positive vibe

now here i will explain who gets the ZERO BLOWPOPS rating. see
at about 4:30 am the music was stopped & the promoter got up onto
the mic said someone had broken into the attached next door bldg &
started a fire in it. they had run after the person but didn't catch
him
so they had to shut down the party because of the fire risk or
whatever. it's the fucker that set a fire that gets a zero blowpops
rating. 
the promoter announces they're moving the whole party to a house
which was leslie's & walt's house which happened to also be where
me & trout soup/jamie were staying.  we got back there pretty quickly
& the house was already filling up. soon the house was totally
packed. walt put the turntables in the basement so there was dance
space & it was packed down there too. the djs got on + spun to
people that barely had room to dance, the party was really going
then. it started to slow down probably around 6. by then other people
were getting chances to spin. people were leaving but i got my chance
at about 7 & spun some breakbeat acid. that was the 1st time
i've ever got to spin out ((well it's kind of) except when i have at a
bar
a few times but people usually just drink there & not dance). i was
nervous as fuck but just didn't think about the people out dancing, so
i concentrated on the records & it turned out ok. then the party was
over by maybe 8. 
much love and thanks to ed for darkside & for djing motivation &
encouragement, to leslie and walt for hosting the afterhrs & for crash
space (i don't think they're on the list + i didn't get a chance to
thank
them so if someone happens to see them please tell them i said
thanks), and to jamie for always picking me up for the columbus
parties. also if any columbus people happen to know scott + amber
(also from columbus) let met know how i can get a hold of them
because i didn't think to get their #s.

  Quite generally open Monday - Friday, 2 pm to 7 pm.  It is supposed to
  move a few buildings down on the right sometime in the near future to
  give it more space.

  btw,  Armore Blvd is in Forrest Hills, east of Pittsburgh, about a third of
        the way to Monroeville.

It was fun, esp for a low budget small party.  I esp liked the visuals.
Except for Sasha G, I didn't track who was spinning but I liked his set.

Good point.  Though one could refill water bottles in the bathroom, this

That's understandable, I guess, if you can't compensate for the
situation, but that's something maybe you should have thought of in the
first place, if you were the one setting up the table.  If not, oh well.

Well, a good friend of mine is a hip-hop DJ (and a damn good one) and
yeah, sometimes he cuts in and out, sometimes he beatmatches, but no
matter what there's a flow to it, and I just didn't feel that flow when
you were spinning.  No offense, really, it may have been a bad night for
you.

Well, I thought a lot about what was "going on" and I came to the
conclusion that it sucked.  Music is my thing;  I produce, sometimes mix
(and mix well), and I know what's good and what's bad.  Maybe I couldn't
have done better, but I know lots of people who could have.  And they
agree with me.

> chris 

    I accept your apoliges, but I have to take issue with this last
statement.  When you're spinning, it's not a narcissistic abstract
artform, it's a service you're providing to the people who are dancing. 
So, if they don't like it, they have the right to criticize.  I didn't
like it.

    But as far as your jungle skills go, I haven't heard you since a
party last Fall (at the house next door), so I can't judge.  Most of
what irked me was the "superstar" tag and all the hype, and that wasn't
your doing, apparently, so I apologize for coming down on you so
harshly.  But next time you do a party, if it's going to be advertised,
especially here, make sure you and the advertisers communicate.

Yeah, I had a good time when the NSF crew was on the mic alongside DJ 
Spaed.  I really enjoyed his techstep, which was a turn for the end of 
the party ... sent everyone home with a good pounding :-)

Another high-light was Pavlaki's set early on.  He spun a pretty dark 
set, too ... and his mixing was right on, so don't test, Ken :-)

Yeah, the room was kinda hot, and too damn smokey.  What's with all you 
ravahs and your oral fixations?  Oh, pass the blunt, okay ... sorry about 
that outburst.  Luckily, one could always chill on the back porch for a 
little and watch the beautiful sites of Pittsburgh's South Side. And 
yeah, there should have been some cups for the water faucet, but I saw 
all kinds of backpacks, don't people bring their own water to raves 
anymore?  Sheesh, it used to be you'd spend all night in a closed down 
warehouse with no heat or electricity, let alone running water.  Don't 
tell me people are getting soft?!

> it was good for da money ... 

Seriously, only 3 bucks.  Maybe that's why shit was so packed.  Being one 
of the DJs, I didn't have any problem with the place being packed, it 
meant all the more bodies to  bounce with the beat, which I guess 
was about all you could do at some stages during the night.  However, by 
the time Spaed went on (3:30), the place had clearing out a lot and there 
was plenty of room to dance.  We were willing to keep the place open 
until sunrise, but by 5am the place had mostly cleared out.  All you 
peeps who were looking for dance space shoulda been there at 4:00, 'cause 
there was all the room you'd need.

Anyways, just wanted to jump in and say thanks to all who showed up and 
had a good time.  The schedule got a little goofy, and Formation and Bit 
didn't get to spin, which I really missed.  I was hoping to hear them 
early in the morning because it had been mostly Jungle up until then.  
I think next time you all should be scheduled for earlier in the night, 
(well, Bit did get to spin at Electric Kingdom, a pleasure not all of us 
had that night :-).  In any case, big respect to EdgarUmmmm and 
telecorps, hope there's another one soon.

they dont need you/us to continue doing events.  in my estimation most
ravers are generally at the events to get drugs.  these are people who are
willing to pay $30 or more for a pill or capsule that may or may not
contain what they think it does.  people who can afford to throw their
money around casually in this way can afford to pay $25 to get in to the
event.  so even if every sober/reasonable person boycotted a specific 
promoter, they would still get most of their crowd, and still be able to 
do events.

well that's spawntaneous for you.  not that they are evil promoters, but
their disorganization, bad flyers, and expensive prices are no surprise to
anyone around here.  i think chris would defend his decisions, tho,
because for the most part they have good reasons for doing what they do...
especially the bad flyers/event names.  i think that's a deliberate
attempt to be silly. 

as for the expensive price at SUICIDE, well i bet there were good reasons
for that too.  all i know is that paul johnson double-booked himself YET
AGAIN (i might add that i will _never_ book him again because of what he
did at ))join(( this april) so they brought dj boris instead (a very good
replacement :).  i dont know anything about the other no-shows. 

and as for expensive events...well, anyone who came out to DARKSIDE 4 
this weekend knows all about it.  ele_mental gouging the scene as usual 
with our expensive prices...in this case $7.00.

in a similar vein, (C) CARBON on nov 16 will be our latest attempt to milk
the scene for all it's worth: $5.00.  empty your wallets now!!!

My only comment here is: "Water better be free!"

I mean, it's a good line-up, but $40 is insane, even for a weekend event,
but this is only one night!  That's just plain stupid.  $28 is
concievable, but it'll end up costing like $60 including transport, tolls,
+ mysterious expenses.

Well, well, well. Right after all the AMP controversy ended in our little
community her we call pb-cle, the spark of life might have been struck. In
the new issue of TV Guide there is a section on MTV getting a makeover.
WEEEELL, unfortunately that includes AMP. It says this "...AMP, currently a
postmidnight show featuring ambient rave music, may get an earlier time
slot". This column neglects to add the fact that this show's schedule is
scattered and those who approve of it have no idea when to expect the fucking
thing. This may be our downfall ladies and gentleman, our underground culture
is about to be dug up at 8:00pm by kids expecting to see the new Alanis video
and are raped by fluid music and visuals like nothing they've ever seen
before. Hopefully they'll change the channel.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

!! Well its that time of year where everyone goes back to skool and 
!! everything changes.  please look over the weeklies, radio shows, and
!! info lines.  i started adding web pages at the bottom, and have put a
!! few email addys with the infolines, any additions or corrections would
!! be appreciated.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

hey kate please post the following to the list(s) - thanks :)

Regarding the party "Elevate" scheduled to happen on Friday, December 6th
thrown by 12 Inches of Velvet:

As compared to the previous e-flier, Elevate is going to have some serious
downsizing. Here is why: This party was being held on the campus of Oberlin
College (outside Cleveland) and was advertised as an AIDS Research Benefit
Event. It gained full support of the Dean of Oberlin, The Oberlin City
Council, and a number of businesses and AIDS organizations who were lending
support to help make it go off large. That was until the Assistant Dean got
wind of the word "rave" (or "r*ve") at which point he set up a chain of
events that, to make a long and irritating story short, has ended with me
sitting at my computer typing this post. Apparently "raves", "ravers", and
"raving" carries some rather negative connocations much larger than we had
assumed to certain Oberlin Faculty members who don't want to lose their job
if someone gets hurt, od's, etc...

Anyways here is the deal as it stands - the location has moved (still on
oberlin campus, tho). Maybe 2 rooms now, probably 1. Capacity is now max of
600 instead of 3000. A bunch of dj's are getting cut (we're still deciding).
There is a slight chance of everything happening as the original post said,
but i doubt it. If it stays the same, ticket prices stay the same ($10
before 12, $12 after). If not, ticket prices will drop (somewhere in the
$4-5 range probably). Kind of a dumb thing since the idea of this party is
to raise money for AIDS research but whatever. Look for another post in a
week or so. Thanks :)

Here's an update the party.  We've had b&w pre-flyers out for about two
months now and half page color pre-flyers out for about two weeks.  The main
flyer comes out later this week.  It was delayed a few weeks because the
designer got quite ill well into the design.  Though we've had a great
response from pre-flyers alone.  Numerous calls on the info line and lots
of addresses added to the mailing list.  Btw, We'll be mailing out the main
flyer to everyone on the mailing list.  So if you are interested, call and
leave your address.

I've put *** before the notes that are new or changed.

I'm quite partial to french, spanish, and portuguese vocals.

Can anyone suggest tapes or CDs of techno or house with such ?

yeah actually..im going...(to mc)

i had posted to the list that flights could be booked from cleveland to
nashville for $106 rt...i dont know if you guys got that one or not...

but if you want, i can post a review of the party
afterwards....unfortunately..that $106 fare was a 14 day adv purchase fare,
so its too lat for that now.. but you may still want to call 1-800-LOW-FARE
or 1-800-FLY-CHEAP  (its the same company) and see whats left...btw its
about (at least) twice as cheap if not more on any flight to leave form
columbus or cleveland since fucking USAIR has a monopoly on pgh int'l...:/

so let me know if you want a review or not....

peace,
hossam

Ahh!  Lucky. :)  Sure you can't fit me in your luggage?  I guess I missed
the flight offer.  While I don't really have $106...it seemed like a
really good deal!

	A group of NEO-NAZIS are trying to form a newsgroup on
Usenet called "rec.music.white-power", so that they can get their
message of hate out to young people using the Internet.
Newsgroups are public discussions on the Internet and their
formation requires enough support from the Internet community.

EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US HAS ONE VOTE when it comes
to creating a new Usenet group.  I hope you will vote NO and
thereby tell these NAZIS we don't want their stuff on the net.  Below
is the procedure, please repost this plea and get the NO vote out.  If
you want to see the official call for votes, you can try on
"news.group".

     DO NOT VOTE TWICE - that would constitute voting fraud.

     HOW TO VOTE:

     Send e-mail (posts to newsgroups are invalid) to:

       music-vote@sub-rosa.com

    This is an impartial, third party vote taker.
     Please check the address before you mail your vote. Your mail
     message,  to be accepted by the counting computer,  must
     contain only the following statement with no signature:

        I vote NO on rec.music.white-power

     Vote counting is automated.  Failure to follow these directions
may mean that your vote does not get counted.  If you do not receive
an acknowledgment of your vote within three days contact the
votetaker about the problem.  It's your responsibility to make sure
your vote is registered correctly.

     Here's what Canada's George Burdi, of the neo-Nazi Heritage
Front, had to say about this vote, on February 21, on his RESISTANCE
mailing list:

   "There is a call for votes coming on rec.music.white-power
   in the next week or so, and you will be notified in a special
   issue of RREN exactly what to do.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
  TO THE LETTER.  Let me be perfectly blunt and state that we   have
  more than enough net-nazis to win this thing handsdown.   But every
  one of you must vote YES!  And just voting    yes means nothing
  unless you do it properly.  So you have   been forewarned.  The
  instructions are coming to your email  box soon, and they are not
  complicated.  Just follow them as told, and we will have a WP music
  newsgroup finally!"

If Mr. Burdi's confidence disturbs you, please give this letter the
widest possible distribution, and help us deliver the largest NO vote 
in 
the history of
the  UseNet.

Da-oh! My bad.  Sorry for the gratuitious off-topic posting everybody.
  Yep, I had seen it before, but got it from a "reliable" source, and
figured that it was up for voting again.  Alas. ;)

On topic: I got forms today to put together an on-campus organization to
throw 'raves' (and other events).  It seems do-able, which is an odd thing
for Pitt.  And then University funding/space can be available (because you
can't get it unless your and *official* <fanfare> organization).

this is how the policy works for penn state as well...
ive looked into forming a student organization like this at penn state, but
its a lot more hassle then its worth; i believe...i tried very hard becuz
of the lack of good venues up here..
dont count so much for funding...and DONT EVER EVER call it a rave in front
of your student activities advisor...
also at penn state, most facilities close at midnight...be sure you would
be able to use facilities after hours (you may have to pay for extra
security)....
keep in mind they would have the right to shut it down at any time..

up at penn state we decided that all of the bullshit you have to go through
to be legitimate is not worth it...in fact i believe we will attract a
better vibe with off-camous venues..non university affiliated.
this way you get to be truly underground..not having to pose a "front" to
anyone...so weigh your options before you go through the whole process of
becoming a student organization.

keep in mind the more orgainzed you are the more bullshit you have to put
up with..like every single decision is voted etc...i myself think a lot
more can get done in terms of throwing a party with three dedicated people
who know whats up rather than having a democratic club in which attendaece
is madatory etc. etc.  you may ebd up having more arguments then truly
inspiring ideas with this framework...

you might have better luck with an "electronic arts club"..or if pitt has
one, talk to them and see if they can sponsor an event..thats an easy way
out of getting facilities..and you could  use support such as film
art..computer art...etc.

sorry this sounds so pessimistic...i truly hope it works just be aware of
certain complications that may arise.

but heres a handy tip people have used before...make sure you stress
"ALCOHOL FREE" in your constitution or mission statement and such...its
attracts the politics of the university....i.e. giving activities for
students to do instead of going to a fraternaty party (etc)

well i hope i at least gave you  somethings to think about...
pitt may have a whole different activities framework than penn state
so dont get discouraged by anything i said
(also take it with a grain of salt cuz ive had a very very bad day)

just be aware:)

good luck geoff

Hello!!!!

This is a post I sent to my local lists and am sending to the beautiful party
people where ever you may be in case someone is from the Boston area and is 
going home for Thanksgiving...


HI!

Here is info on a party I am throwing on November 30th in Boston called WISH. 
There's more info here than you probably need, but just in case you don't get a
flyer it's pretty much all here.

eye of the storm productions presents...

WISH

Boston, MA
November 30, 1996

GUEST
Kimball Collins
John Kelley (check out "Funky Desert Breaks" - Moonshine)
James Christian

FROM BOSTON
Dale Charles
Bruno

LIVE ACT
Kooky Scientist - Fred Geannelli

and for the Jungle Massive...

LTJ Bukem w/MC Conrad (w/two one and a half hour sets)
Soulslinger
Overload
Timestretch
Casper

and DJ Venom doing a bit Ragged Jungle and some Happy Hard Core

SOUND, LIGHTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

by TOTAL AUDIO with 50,000 watts of Turbo Sound UK.  This is the same system
used at HEAR NO EVIL if you were there except there will be more of it.

by PHUTURE - Leo is pumped and has been given the freedom to do everything he
can to bring you the greatest light show ever.  Some of the lights include a
new light called the Martin Mac (robotic light with 360 degrees of mobility)
which is a prototype light and the only one in North America, scanners, data
flashes, and lasers (to really name just a few of the lights).

by NOISE LABORATORIES who will bring you an incredible live media show on 75
televisions surrounding the entire dance floor.

OTHER ATTRACTIONS

3,000 madd smiling faces, decorations (which I guarantee will transform this
venue into a ferry tale wonderland), tribal percussionist so bring your bongos,
unearthly characters handing out candy, toys, and fruit throughout the night :)

There will also be a cloak room, meeting point for netizens and friends, first
aid station, venue concessions with bottled water for $1.00, and polite
professional security.  One of the problems with HNE was entry.  This time
there will be five ticket booths and ten friendly security people doing the
searches, and nothing like Fitchburg security.

Doors will open at 10:00 PM and this party is 18+ (POSITIVE ID REQUIRED)  Sorry
to all of you who are just missing this, but this is a necessity and part of
the contract and entertainment license.  The price is $20 in advance, $25 at
the door and tickets can be purchased at (by next Thursday):

MA - Boston Beat - Biscuithead - Satellite - Dynamite CT - Phoenix Records -
Solemate - Bodywares - NY - Satellite - Liquid Sky - Bugg Clothing - VT -  Flex
Records - NJ - Planet X Records - RI - Lunasea - PA - 611 Records 

Mail Order tickets are available for those who can't get to a ticket outlet by
sending me a postal money order for $20 (add $2 for registered/certified mail
and postage)  along with a self addressed envelope by 11/23 to, Chris Maxwell,
Eye of the Storm Productions, 1004A Kings Way, Waltham, MA 02154

So here's a bit on the VENUE:

It's Suffolk Downs, BOSTON, which is two miles from Logan airport.  This event
is 100% LEGAL and SAFE.  Suffolk Downs is on the blue line so public
transportaion is not a problem.  The place is big.  There are two rooms with
40,000 SQ. FT. in the main arena and about 15,000 in the Jungle Room.  There's
plenty of space to dance, to chill, to socialize (there's an entire area that
is free of music if you need to get away for a bit, and may have some ambient
type music.  I just haven't organized that area yet).  Parking is free.  I'm
working on a good location for the after hours that is also T accessible, but
it's not final.  Their may be a charge for the after hours because things are a
bit more expensive in Boston, but I promise you it will be a total surprise! 
If you went to the one after HNE I will say that that is the tradition I plan
to keep - PHAT!

So as far as the do's and don't, it goes like this...
    
PLEASE DO NOT BRING bottles, cans, markers, weapons, bad attitudes or
negativity

Be safe and smart at this event if your into this or that.  Crystal, K, Coke,
Roofies, Heroin and Dust are crap in my opinion, and don't belong.  

BRING HAPPINESS, POSITIVITY, CANDY, STUFFED ANIMALS, BONGOS, WHISTLES AND OTHER
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, HUGS & KISSES, MAGICAL WANDS (GLOW STICKS) AND FERRY DUST
(GLITTER), AND EVERYTHING THAT TRULY KEEPS THE VIBE ALIVE :) COLORFUL
CHARACTERS PUT SMILES ON OUR FACES

Most info lines everywhere are supporting this event, but because of lack of
flyer space, and time, I couldn't cover them all.  The one's that are will have
the details by next week, and spread the word because time is running out. 
Flyers will be ready tomorrow night.  The hold up has been the license.  

DIRECTIONS:  Suffolk Downs is in East Boston, two miles past the Logan Airport
exit after the Callahan Tunnel off of Route 1N (towards Lynn/Revere).  From all
points just head into Boston and follow the Logan Airport signs on 93.

PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION:  T - take the blue line from Government Center towards
Wonderland.  Get off at the Suffolk Downs stop.  The last T leaves Government
Center at 12:45 am, and the first morning train leaves  Suffolk Downs at 6:00
am.  From South Station, for all you train and greyhound travelers, take the
red line towards Alewife and switch to the Orange line at Downtown Crossing. 
Head towards Oak Grove, get off at State Street, then take the blue line
towards Wonderland.

MBTA & Commuter Rail Info 617-222-3200 Am Track Info 1-800-872-7245 Greyhound
Info 1-800-231-2222 Taxi 617-289-1799 Hotel 617-569-5250

MAIN INFO LINE: 617-576-8895, EMAIL: maxwel2_chri@bentley.edu

So that's about  it.  There's a lot more planned, and being planned which you
will see there, but I promise you that this gathering will represent!

PEACE!
Max

In a message dated 96-11-05 12:42:27 EST, you write:

<< > $40 bucks at the door for that????  you're out of your fucking mind....
 
 My only comment here is: "Water better be free!"
 
 I mean, it's a good line-up, but $40 is insane, even for a weekend event,
 but this is only one night!  That's just plain stupid.  $28 is
 concievable, but it'll end up costing like $60 including transport, tolls,
 + mysterious expenses.
  >>

I agree with geoff.  (Hi geoff!  Amie said you said hi.  How's the radio
show?) It's criminal and totally stupid not to have free water.  This pissed
me off to no end at the last Bassrush, even tho at summer rush, there -was-
free water...but not everyone knew.  Plus, the lineup in the jungle room is
fine, but just kinda standard--enough that I really don't know if I want to
pay that much and go thru the hassle of getting there.  Maybe I'm spoiled
after the international lineup of the last 2, but I don't know.  I think I
need some impressive extras to get me there, like free sparkling grape juice
at midnight and a couple circus acts.  

Ay vey, I'm getting cynical in my old age.

'the first insight is the insight of awakening, and focus on the
mysterious coincidences that occur in each of our lives. of course
for centuries, we have been discounting such occurences as pure
chance and thus without meaning. but as we ponder the spiritual
dimension of our existence, opening our minds, we begin to experience
phenomena that cannot be dismissed and pushed away' --- The C. P.

THE PROPHECY first appeared in the west...multiple EARGASMs are
reoccuring here in the north...an EMERGING CULTURE aware of THE   
NINTH INSIGHT has emerged to the east...finally a new Eternal
Peace Tribe (E.P.T.) will be rebirthed to the south...

YOU, as members of The Family of Light, must decide for yourselves:
should the sleeper awaken...

the MUSIC simply brought you together, only YOU can decide whether
you will learn from the ones you have encountered within the scene
to evolve yourself...

the rabbit never destroyed himself, he simply evolved...his spirit
lives on in all the lives he had touched...

I'm passing this on to the list at the request of the party holder.  
Note:  This is not a rave, but a house party featuring some music that 
ravers may enjoy.  I don't want this shit to blow up as it did for 
Starchild, so please come to the party, just understand that it might be 
crowded, people will be drinking, and other such things that happen at 
parties.  Besides that, the guy throwin the party wants this to be an 
open invitation, so please show up ... there will be Jungle, Hardcore, 
and some breaks spun, as well as some visuals and party favors :-)

Info line and such is below...

Yes!  Divine was fun, fun, fun and then my daddy took my T-bird away.
The lights were especially radiant -> A+ on that!  The line-up was a good,
especially since I hadn't heard much trancy stuff lately.  
One thing I'd suggest is if you're only having one jungle act, put it in
the middle, or maybe shorter sets at both ends.  I'm only really saying
this because I usually love Sine's jungle sets, but totally missed it
because I didn't get there till late.  Also, if you're using the irish
center in the future, get lots of de-humidifiers or fans or something,
because it was like a sauna in there! :)

Another thing about the party - sooo many people!  What was the final
count?  I was quite impressed, especially since I personally wasn't
overwhelmed by the promotion for it (though it was there).

Can't wait for Sub-Zero!

Adam - I think there's at least one house mailing list out there, maybe
more.  I remember one subbed every rave list to itself a few months back.
Maybe check out hyperreal or do a search and you can find one.  I don't
know why people don't post...maybe it's not carried by many systems. (??)

    I respect your opinions pope, but I must give props to house. 
Besides, alot of jungle and techno tracks put out today definitly have a
house feel or influence.  You can't beat a slamm'n deep house track to
put you in the right mood.  
    BTW I'll post on the house list Adam.

were finally getting some parties started at penn state, however..outside
experience from either pittsburgh or phillly or anywhere else would be
appreiciated....no one has a decent light show up here....
        if you think you could help us out for a party December 7th, (i
know its the same day as delphi, but we should have a decent
turnout)....the space isnt THAT big so no lasers or expensive hyped
technology needed....also we wouldnt be able to pay you an insane amount of
$$ becuz we wanna keep parties like this going on..
        if you are dedicated to the cause of helping out a starving
mid-state scene and have some lights that will capture the vibe of about
150-250 kids; email me back SOON and we will negotiate..
        thanks:)

Subject: {pb-cle} Prodigy`s "Breathe"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Hello people.

Ok, there is a new single of the Prodigy out, called "Breathe".
Wel, atleast in the UK.
I hope it crosses the ocean soon!

The friend of mine that studies there also with the information, he
sent me a sampled minute of the song.
His comments were not so good. He says that its Prodigy allright,
but there is something missing. Giorgos rates it a bit bellow firestarter.
My comments?
Well, it shows clearly the way The Prodigy are heading, leaving the techno
style of the early rave scene of the 90`s and coming out to an alernative
rock/rave combination. Quite interesting I might say, although I have stopped
being fun of the alternative rock after coming to the States.
It includes a good "prodigy style" beat, hip hop lyrics and electric guitar.

The single also includes the live versions of "Poison" and "Their Law" and to
close with a number four, as most of the Prodigy singles are, there is another
track, which Giorgos likes it better than Breathe!
Unfortunately I forgot its name and I just deleted his mail...
It has piano though. 
Unfortunately, Giorgos had to spoil it by saying that it is simular (if
better)
to the theme of a Microsloth commercial.
Way to go Giorgo. Now every time I hear it, I will remember Microsloth...

PS.1. Thanks to all the people that replied to my question about the music
store.
          Too bad I don`t have a car and none of them are in downtown.
PS.2. The new Prodigy album is still not out.
PS.3. I don`t enjoy much of the non purpose swearing, but I take it as part
          of the american underground culture.

Tsiou!
Aristotelis

Is _this_ crossposting really necessary?  *ducks*
Just to make this relevant, anyone who's down with small vibey warehouse 
parties, and digs trance and techno (and happy hardore for that matter), 
come to Active Ingredients' party called "Fuck the Bullshit" on New 
Year's in the Baltimore, MD area.  Extremely limited capacity, extremely 
kicking vibe.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

!! Well its that time of year where everyone goes back to skool and 
!! everything changes.  please look over the weeklies, radio shows, and
!! info lines.  i started adding web pages at the bottom, and have put a
!! few email addys with the infolines, any additions or corrections would
!! be appreciated.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

sorry,

i had the wrong person. i should have said" pope trout" no need to speak
for everyone. it's okay to have that opinion, but don't assume that
everyone else does also.

Cc: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

just saw this flyer for a party in cleveland on nov 29th:


SAT NOV 29, 1996 : Cleveland OH

LP Productions brings you:

 PLA'TAL

paul johnson (chicago)
larry heard/mr fingers (chicago)
bernard badie (chicago)
rob sherwood (cleve)
mike filly (cleve)
steve cinch/sleepy c (cleve)
mike sparks (cleve)
kevin bumpers (cleve)

the flyer says that this event is going to be held within an "enclosed
urban environment in a recreated live forest." the info-line also says that
there will be trees, bushes, and grass, and the location will be announced
the day before the event.

also, the flyer has an error as to the date: NOV 29 is a FRIDAY not a SAT
as the flyer says. the info-line says the party is on friday.

********i just have a few questions :

1. the flyer gives props to centrak, eyegasm, and maxximum---does this mean
that the lights are going to be done by centrak and eyegasm? are
frenche&crew doing the sound??

2. who exactly is LP ? does anyone know anything about them?

3. what is the price of this party going to be?



*******other comments:

**the indoor forest sounds RaD!

**the line-up is pretty nice considering this is cleveland :P

**(nice to see someone is trying to bring back PJ after he didnt show or
whatever @suicide)

**i hate errors on flyers. and to mess up the _date_ ack! (and please dont
tell me that is _supposed_ to be there like on the 420 flyer)

**BUT the flyer is small, cute, and the font is pretty cool even if it is a
little bit difficult to read --props to kevy kev for that :)

**i like the whole treehouse motif..cute ;)

**sorry to say i will not be at this party although i would love to check
it out. i will be in arkansas chillin wit da fam.  ;)

**to give respect to the cleveland college radio IS FUCKING AWESOME; the
flyer says, "wcsb 89.3, wruw 91.1, wujc 88.7 (the real radio
revolutionists)"; that is really really cool; cleveland has some really
good college radio (elecronic music and otherwise) and it is nice to see
someone giving them the respect they deserve ! =D


alright...i think that is it.

if anyone has any info, please post. (kevy kev??)


thanks!

Precedence: bulk

If anyone wants to have a net meet at Star Jump in Nashville this
weekend, I suggest 2:00am, after the 'Happy Hardcore Sound Clash', to
the left of the stage or on the left portion of the stage. I'll put up
an obnoxious flourescent orange poster board with "Net Meat" scrawled in
completely illegible handwriting to stage left. Also, I'll be standing
under the obnoxious signage. I'll have purple hair and shall be wearing
silver vinyl pants and a hideous green vinyl jacket with 'Coke is it!'
inscribed on the lapel.


See ya,
MC/DJ Baron

Ok kids.. for all you analogue freaks out there, I have discovered what 
might be the most insane program ever.  It's called "RubberDuck", and it 
is basically a fun little virtual tb-303 for PCs.  Some kids from Germany 
developed it, and let me just say that it sounds incredibly realistic.

You can generate up to 14 pages of acid lines on it's built-in sequencer, 
mess around with the attacks and slides for each note, then REAL TIME 
screw with the modulation, the overdrive, the cut-offs, u name it.  Plus, 
u can set the sequencer to run your pages randomly, creating a totally 
insane and constantly changing acid frenzy.  It has to be seen to be 
believed.

The US mirror site is awfully slow (around 815k, but slow throughput) but 
believe be it is well worth the download for those who want to play 
around with the sounds but don't have the cash to drop on an actual bass 
line or other gear.  

This is the download of the century, IMHO.

German site:

http://www.waste.uni-essen.de/d-usion

US Mirror site:

http://www.students.uiuc.edu/~gruschow/rubduck.dip

ACID FOR THE MASSES.

WOWW... Everyone with a PC as to try this shit out, it kicks ass, even
for non-collecting-gear-geeks who just like the dancing ;)... I Just
made a track tonite as a matter of fact ;p... Anyway how close is this
to a real one (I've never touch one), i'm sure it can't compare but
someone say something in the least..

Gotta love that chaos switch and you can even add beats to it with a
looped wav sample...:) Match it up with another sequencer and "it gets
the job done"..;p..

wow i bet 700 kiddies with whistles is nothing compared to 700 of them with
a program like this :P
pretty soon copyrigths laws might have to say something about this program
if its as cool as i think it is....has there been anything like that
regarding the MC-303? i can imagine someone making the exact same
song....it all sounds the fucking same to me:P

CARBON is the 6th ele_ment concert event, and will occur this saturday nov
16 in columbus ohio. 

for those who are not aware of what these events are, the ele_ments have
been an attempt to present electronic music performances in a more serious
light.  they are an opportunity for techno artists to debut their newest
electronic compositions in an atmosphere of creativity and in the presence
of fellow appreciators of electronic music. 

the performances will last from 10 PM till 2 AM, so please arrive early to
catch all three performers.  also, like many of the previous ele_ments, the
live shows will be followed by a more traditional type of event/party that
will continue till at least 6 AM. 

the latest event is indeed a special one, and is a celebration of the 5th
anniversary of the formation of a band called BODY RELEASE (1991-1993),
whose core members went on to form the ele_mental collective.  each are 
presenting their latest music as separate artists. 

TITONTON DUVANTE will begin the night promptly at 10 PM with a selection
of his latest techno concoctions, and will be backed on several pieces by
his own MARZIPAN ENSEMBLE which features 4 string players and one voice. 

CHARLES NOEL, performing as MONOCHROME, will follow around 11.30 PM with
his collection of experimental/melodic jungle tracks, many of which are 
over a year old but have never been heard at an event before.  also look 
for the debut of a re-work of carl craig's "bug in a bass bin" that 
challenges the original in innovation.

TODD SINES is the final live performer, at about 12.30 AM, presenting a
rare compilation of his mimimalistic work as .X TRAK, ENHANCED, TRAIT, and
his latest electro compositions as CRON. 

following the three performances will be a very special collaboration 
which will be revealed at the event.

after 2AM the event will become a little more familar, with DJ sets by:

DAVE COOPER from toronto - techno, house, & jungle
TODD SINES - techno and electro
TITONTON DUVANTE - techno and jungle
MOONSTARR from toronto - jungle
MONOCHROME - house, traxx, and jungle
DAT from POORBOY detroit - techno
and possible other guests

space concerns: at this point we want to reassure everyone that the 
space _will be heated_.  however, due to circumstances beyond our control, 
the location will not be revealed until the day of the event, this 
saturday.  call the table of ele_ments at 614.470.0929 the day of, or if 
you have web access, directions should also be available at:
http://ele-mental.coil.com/what.will.be/

travel concerns: columbus has received only a light dusting of snow, 
which will be gone by saturday.  temperatures look warmer for this 
weekend, so travel should not be a problem unless you are coming from the 
snow-drenched great lakes area.

admission to this event will only be $5, in the true spirit of our more 
intimate events.

sound will be provided by JERICHO, whose loud, clean system has graced 
most of our recent events, and lighting ele_ments will be provided by 
myself (LUNAR) and RAMos (tony ramos).

thanks to all of you who have expressed an interest in making the techno 
experience a deeper one (you know who you are).  this is for all of you.

Ok Kids, here's a competition from the Drum & Bass Arena -> You can win

=================================================================
>1. the flyer gives props to centrak, eyegasm, and maxximum---does this mean
>that the lights are going to be done by centrak and eyegasm? are
>frenche&crew doing the sound??
=================================================================
steve & the centrak crew w/ the lasers...chip & the eyegasm crew
w/ the lights...french-e & the maxximum crew w/ the sound

=================================================================
>2. who exactly is LP ? does anyone know anything about them?

        A: LP productions is this guy named paul. don't know MUCH about
           him except that sleepy-c set me up to do the flyer, because
           is mac couldn't handle making this TREE that is on the flyer.
           i also know that he reigns from cleveland, DEFINITLEY is well
           funded enough to deliver what he promises, and is down with
           mike filly and that whole circle of people.
==================================================================
yup, the voice on the info-line definitly sounds like filly or one
of his buds. this would also explain the props to the college radio
stations, since filly used to be involved w/ wujc & we used to pull
him on the air illegally on wruw...plus all the college radio stations
were the main promotors for pulling college kids for the aquilon/the
smart bar that filly & rob sherwood were involved w/ back in the day
...rob's involvement would also explain the predominantly chicago
HOUSE line-up...larry heard aka mr. fingers (black market records),
one of the founding fathers of chicago house, bernard badie (cajual,
circuit records), another chicago house legend, and of course every
body knows paul johnson (relief, peacefrog records), definitely
keepin' the faith (when he shows up)...plus everyone knows kevin
bumpers is part of the sherwood/filly crew

===================================================================
>3. what is the price of this party going to be?

        A: stay in touch with the info line - i don't know for SURE,
           but i THINK it's gonna be in the $25 range.
===================================================================

i heard it's supposed to be $20, prolly in advance.

===================================================================
>**i hate errors on flyers. and to mess up the _date_ ack! (and please dont
>tell me that is _supposed_ to be there like on the 420 flyer)

        A: TOTALLY *my* fuck-up... actually it was on the original
           info sheet that was faxed to me THAT WAY (sat.nov.29.96) and i
           never THOUGHT to check the calendar. and even AFTER that
           paul guy came down to columbus to proof if ON SCREEN ( the
           whole thing was a SUPER rush job ) he read it over AND never
           said anything about it. - arash printed it and off it went...
           it was SUPPOSED to be die cut around the edge of the tree,
           but from what i'm told, the die cut would've cost a BOATLOAD
           because of the complexity of the cut itself - so THAT was
           scrapped. but at NO TIME during the production of this flyer
           was ANYTHING said about the date being on friday...

           BUT!!... i'll take the blame for it - i should've checked it
           more closely ( even though it was soooo rushed )

           i'll tell ya though - i got a FUCKIN earful when this thing
           came out... and not so much from like, you guys, or anyone else
           that has noticed the mistake - but from LP, who was to the
           point of "he-must-have-done-it-on-purpose" kinda mad. INFERRING
           that i must have dupped the flyer because of some ficticious
           allegiance i have with some RIVAL cleveland crew or something...
                ...c'mon, gimme a FUCKIN BREAK!!!
           i know that the politix in cleveland are like NO OTHER... but,
           pa-leeeeeaze - this is some BULLSHIT... rival crews?
           do they REALLY think i'd give up my integrity for THAT??!!!
===========================================================================

no shit, cleveland's got bad politix...just last night i went to check out
Ewareness rob divine's new wednesday night out @ the Last Drop, which i 
know he started up just to spite carol who's doing her wednesday night out,
Eargasm. i feel bad cuz i'm friends w/ both kevin (who spins @ Ewareness)
and mike (who spins @ Eargasm)...so i ended up going to both, despite the
snow storm...plus everybody knows about the spawntaneous 3 year anniversary
vs. seven blows of the dragon (btw kevy kev the reason why i haven't gotten
back to u on hookin u up w/ the party is cuz it looks like kirsten might
not be doing it anymore @ all).

alls i can say is kevy kev is the man when it comes to doing graphics & flyers!
any guy that helps me get my computer graphic assignment done for my art class
w/ no charge gets mad props in my book!

plus everyone remembers that stoopid flame war me & michael had over the
petty typos on the 420 flyer...really petty stoopid stuff...kinda like the
arguements i have w/ my girlfriend, who coinkidinkly happens to be from
columbus...so if anything, atleast for me, i know there's a special bond
between cleveland & columbus...me & my friends have been hitting ele mental
partys since forever...and i alwaze see a bunch of columbus kids here in
cleveland also...i know both mary and ed were @ suicide...and i know both
brad & jeff are helping promo for carbon here in cleveland...and i know i
helped promo for proton...so i think both cities are pretty supportive of
each other.

everything's set!  we just hope we can get some people to experience this
special event... 

DIRECTIONS: 

from the N take I-71 S to downtown columbus and look for the BROAD ST 
exit, go LEFT.

from the S take I-71 N to downtown columbus and look for the BROAD ST 
exit, go RIGHT.

from E or W take 70 into columbus, take 71 N to the BROAD ST exit and 
then take a RIGHT.

from OSU campus get to I-71 S and get off at the BROAD ST exit, go LEFT.

once you are on broad st go about 2 lights east, away from downtown, to
PARSONS AVE (look for a KFC on the corner).  go RIGHT on parsons and
follow it south for about 12-13 lights (about 2 miles). 

a couple blocks past a boarded-up dairy queen, look for a small street
named WOODROW, go RIGHT (if you pass schottensteins and the thrift store
you've gone too far). once on woodrow, go one block west to WASHINGTON,
take a LEFT, and go south one more block to a small alley called
STANAFORD.  take a RIGHT on stanaford and you will see plenty of parking,
and the space: a large, concrete building with blue doors.  park, look for
the two blue doors under 4 metal pillars, and enter. 

the space: 

THE SOUTHSIDE SETTLEMENT HOUSE, which is a really cool community center
located only a couple blocks away from where SNOW*FALL was.  the space is
large, comfortable, heated, and looks really neat, with lots of little
areas to explore.  there is also a full kitchen at our disposal in case
anyone wants to bake 'n' rave (har har). 

keep in mind that titonton's much-touted performance (with the live 
string players) will begin very near to 10 PM, so get there early to 
catch the whole experience.

any problems, call the table of ele_ments at 614.470.0929.

Hey...is anyone in the Cleveland-area going to The Church (aka Trilogy)

      Justice" in 1992 ?
A:  Blame

On another note:  Anyone go to Xanadu this past weekend?  It sounded
really coool, but I couldn't really go.  Reviews?  Also: Starjump?  I'm
sure the people who made it there just haven't recovered yet. ;)

yah the report was that cleveland's belle was at CARBON, chillin with
melanie from mekka (if anyone here frequents mekka she's the chesty
bartendar with dark hair and very glamorous looks...sorry to sound sexist
but that's how she looks).  i must admit i only heard about this after the
event so i didnt get to hear his reaction to our little get-together :)
altho i bet he felt much like i do sometimes: "darn these little kids!" 
hehe

btw he is the highest-paid sports boy on the planet (i think).  do i care? 
not really.  but it is probably the funniest thing we've had happen at any
of our events, besides the guy who was jerking off in a little porno room
we set up at COMFORT back in 1993. 

"HUUUUHH?!?!" you may be asking.  yes it's true.  i know it sounds gross
but it was really funny...i had some really old stag films i showed at
like 1/8 speed and set the projector in a small room with a red lightbulb 
(get it?!?!).  anyway, this older guy wandered into the party and must 
have found these old films invigorating (altho at such an incredibly-slow 
speed i dont know _what_ was making him horny)...and at some point he
just whipped out his 'jon thomas' in front of everyone.  it was quite 
charming, to say the least.

the funniest of all was that only 1/2 the people at the event were
offended...the other 1/2 thought it was _great_!!  that's why i
laughed...it raised a lot of spectatorship issues and whatnot.  i would 
go on and be analytical and all that, but i talk too much as it is.  

although...maybe i'll pull them old films out again someday?  




naaaaaahh. 

btw i will post some more substantive thoughts on CARBON whan i gets a 
chance.

No, that's a good question.  You cannot post to pb-cle from a different
email address that appears in the list.  So if you have your mail
forwarded to another place but the original email address is on the list,
your posts won't come through.  Also, some people read the list on the web
and on public BBoards, like people at CMU.  Those people will also need to
subscribe to the list before making any posts.

Well thanks again to the media who steals our music but destroys out scene
we have been depicted as drunks a K-heads.

Every single raver summed up to be a druggie soul stealers.

Why aren't there positive images bieng displayed about our community.

Why didn't they talk about our theoretical P.L.U.R..

And where in the HELL did they get these people who testified for the scene.

I am so furious!

We'll  I think we'll continue to be underground and illegal whether we wan't
to or not.

$15 is cheap?

i dare spawntaneous to throw an event less than $10 someday.  and i dont 
want to hear how "it cant be done in cleveland."

maybe we'll have to go up there and show them how to do it.

So, let me get this right.  People who want to post here won't even know 
this unless they subscribe, but they won't know this unless they're 
already on this list..?  Just checking.

read this slowly: some people receive pb-cle mail from other accounts or
read it on the web.  since these people don't have an email address in the
list, or since their email address might be slightly different, the list
processor rejects their messages.

i'm getting about 15 bounces a day from people replying to list messages
who aren't subscribed from the email address they're sending mail from.
bottom line, if you don't see your messages coming through, you *will*
need to subscribe your new address.

 When did this air? I was at the party they filmed (Maskarave), in fact
they filmed me setting my gear up. I believe they interviewed Scotto too. 
Did you happen to tape it? I doubt if this will hurt us much people are
bound to become immune to their "message"  when they are only being given
one half of the story. It happened in th UK it will happen here.

    I agree that the bad publicity is somewhat detrimental and bad for
the scene.  Not all ravers are druggies and even the ones that do
partake in illegal substances aren't "bad ravers".  Besides, alot of the
people who do partake in drugs only do it on occasion.

I personally want the scene to be underground.

This has been going on since 1992. Nothing has changed, if anything the
scene has grown and spread in spite off (but probably even somewhat due
to) the negative hype.  Rather than discuss this ad nauseum here why not
write to the editorial staff of American journal at: 

http://www.americanjournal.com/ajournal/ajform.html

(by the way the managing editor used to produce a show here in Pittsburgh
called Evening Magazine)

Or you could badger the investigative department at:

http://www.americanjournal.com/invest/FORM.HTML

Spread this around to the other rave lists you are on as well as alt rave,
and let AJ know how you feel about their continued one sided "expose's" of
the rave scene.

i'd like to know how we can get in touch with these suckers and let them 
know that their little expose is only one side to our scene.

i'd also like to see a full transcript if possible, since i didnt get to 
see it.  i'd love to use their own words to prove how irresponsible their 
journalism is.

private replies, please (i'll post any info i get).

tanx in advance

Less than 8 months old, cosmetically and functionally perfect.  I still

Does anybody know if SubZero is still going on, and if the line-up is the
same?  Just wondering because I'v only seen a very few, very small flyers.
I REALLY hope it's still happening, but I have fears. :) stickman?

michael sed:
=================================================================
i heard pla'tal is gonna be in the agora.  someone please let me know on
this?  i want to see 3 of the dj's but the agora is WACK and if it's there
and more than 15 bux i will prolly not go.

bring back checkerboard sleeves,
michael
allroy
==================================================================

tee hee, who told u that one...*CHANEL*?

welp here's what the voice-mail sez:

"we have created the most unique environment featuring a real
 forest enclosed in an urban environment with grass, bushes,
 and trees. pre-sale tickets will be sold at the NEW MUSEUM
 downtown cleveland and AVALON retail shop columbus, ohio.
 the location of the event will be disclosed one day before
 the event..."                          

and the flyer sez:                            

"warner kingwood nurseries (the forest of foliage)"

so unless they've torn out the seats @ the agora concert theatre
to plant an indoor forest with grass, bushes, and trees recently,
i would assume the party is being held @ warner kingwood nurseries.

personally i think they should throw a free afterhours
party featuring a dance battle between:                     

ed "square dance king" luna vs.        
chris "if it ain't dope it's fuckin shwag" calabreeze

to see who should earn the right to throw parties in cleveland.
of course kimm would be the round # girl

and we could have for the judges:

jethrox "ozzie rules" drop bass network
dan "date my daughter" efex
& matt "i walk around my house naked" magazine

The confusion regarding the closed list policy was a little too much, so I
opened the list again.  We'll get spam mail too, but at least people who

beware:: another "i miss pittsburgh post" *sigh*

i talked to skinner on vrave today and as of noon today skinner didnt have
a plane ticket to pittsburgh...he said he was going to call rick..so i dont
know...
but who said big names and glossy flyers attract good vibe?
how dare anyone question the promotional skillz of stickman???? hehehe just
kidding it is sort of weird theyre arent that many flyers...it is a
hardcore party..but whatever it is there is probably a good reason why a
lot of people didnt get flyers...pittsburgh needs more people like rick to
show goood promotional skillz at work...anybody remeber the good vibe of
daedalus??!!!
that party rocked!!! (set up a lot better than "that thing" so people could
be socialbutterflys in between the two rooms)
just a thought...im not going only becuase of financial problems and i have
finals coming up (oh yeah!) but personally id rather go to a fuel PARTY
than an nsync PRODUCTION..
it just  so happens though it will be easier for me to catch a 2.5 hour car
ride with my trendy raver peeps to a big lineup much easier than it is to a
good vibe party with lots of cool aliens!
i guess thats just how it goes...everyones gotta image up here its
pathetic. (thats what i miss about pittsburgh and da jive turkeyz...*sigh*
i miss a lot of peeps who fit in to the scene because they were true to
themselves..its harder to find that shit up here and in baltimore/d.c.)
        peeps have to brag about who they danced to and said hi to and shit...
i could give a shit what trendy fucks think of me:) i actully like wearing
my adidas breakpants and shoes with a freshive tshirt so people can
recognize me, but im definately losing that candy feeling...too much candy
is a bad thing....time to get funky underground in my wardrobe!!!!
no more name brands and logos for me...but enough about my style..:P ( if
you ever go to buzz youll know what im talking about)
        i saw chemicals bros last weekend in d.c. thats a whole different
story..i was rollin with my 412 represent shirt (tommy h imitation) among
alll those polo/nautica/tommy hilfiger cliques...at a glance it looked like
i fit in...i ran into some friends from oil city (the only pittsburghers i
saw *sigh*) who said that stickman was there but im sure i wouldve seen
him...i wish he was there so we couldve just looked at people and made fun
of them...hehe..i believe he was there in spirit..
        well, im coming home on wednesday for a few dayz..anything
happening november 27-28-29-30 in pittsburgh????!!! i was gonna come home
tommorow for subzero..(my parents are out of town for once!!!)  djbliss and
rager pez and few others were going to crash at my place..
if you have a place for them to stay saturday..go on to hypperreal.com 7283
and tell bliss that..
or his email is activ@mindspring.com
        awwight gotta go!!  have fun....be safe..drink pepsi (ive heard
they manufacture mdma)
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
peace out

=================================================================
oh well i am OFFICIALLY a sucker now (as opposed to unofficially).

sad thing is, i know hannah personally and i STILL fell for it.  i even
mailed her a nice "welcome-to-the-scene-you-dont-have-to-do-drugs-to-be-
cool" message.  DOH!! 

what can i say.
================================================================= 

no! I AM OFFICIALLY a sucker now!

i thought michael wuz joking when he sed he heard that PLA'TAL
would be @ the agora now...welp talked w/ filly yesterday & they
did lose the space...who the hell keeps informing the owners of
spaces that raves are such a bad thing in cleveland...same thing
happened w/ the sm:)e party & that party had to be moved too... 
the ironic part is that the cleveland police are working the 
security for the party so it can't be done any more legally!...
i do kinda feel bad for the promotor of PLA'TAL mostly becuz
it wuz s'posed to be his first party and he is trying his best
to keep it going by dumping a huge load of money on importing
trees and stuff to really make an indoor forest...i even offered
to help promo the party, but he never returned my call, so i
dunno what to say about this party anymore...

my apologies to michael & jeff...btw thanx for hooking me up w/
some new music @ Best Buy <-- the place to go for largest selection
of techno cd's & compilations prolly in cleveland right now, since
we don't even have deep records anymore :( boo hoo!

to hear stevie laughing @ what a sucker he wuz, call the # below...

...i still think ed & chris should have a li'l dance battle to see
who gets to throw partys in cleveland now, tee hee =)

Best Buys is the best place in Cleveland for techno CD's?
I see you don't know Cleveland's record shops too well.
Have you heard of Bent Crayon? That's where I, dan curtin,
gank, mike filly, campion, sleepy c, and many many others
get their techno. It's located at 11600 Detroit road (next
to the Red Star Cafe) and they have a website as well at
http://www.bentcrayon.com

I shop there on a weekly basis and get all the newest and best
techno releases. And and if they don't have what I'm lookin for
in the store, they can usually get it for me within a week.

Within the last two weeks I've purchased the releases by
the following artists at bent crayon: Paperclip People, Ian 
Pooley, Dave Clarke, Dan Curtin, Joey Beltram, Mike Inc, Jeff
Mills, Cristian Vogel, Aux 88, Terrance Parker, Dave Angel, 
Aphex Twin, Ian Obrien, Richie Hawtin, and Carl Craig. And
that's just my purchases in the last two weeks!

So, if you liked the Best Buys techno selection, you'll love 
Bent Crayon because they have about 10x more. Check it out.

Call 221-9200 for directions & ask for John.
BTW: I'm not affiliated with the store. I'm just a
happy customer.

Hey all.  This is steph a. with my third addy in as many
months.  :P  Anyway, this e-flier is for a brand new bi-weekly
event in Philly hosted by Pittsburgh's own d.Cypol.  It's a high-
energy techno night happening in the same club as Koncrete
Jungle.  If you're in the area, come check it out!  

And while I'm here may I add that I finally got a copy of d.Cypol's tape
from over the summer, and I am hooked!  I never knew I liked Happy
Hardcore till I started playing his tape to wake me up and put me in a
good mood early in the morning.  Plus he spins a mean jungle set too.

I agree, I work at Best Buys and the selection is EXTREMELY 
limited....another nice place to buy techno is My Generation on Detroit 
Road in Westlake...they've got just about everything, hope I helped 
someone! :)

Aaaah... I see... a mistake, is it?  Oh, that explains it all.  ;)  And 
just to let everyone know, it's DORK, not GEEK.  So there.  :P

Subject: {pb-cle} TEAMSTERS - review
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

alrighty, here's a mini review of Basehead's TEAMSTERS party last night...

I got there around 1am.  The Pieta is a very nice place, just a single room
that is good sized...holds about 200 kidz.  I saw the best show of my life
there a couple of years back.  Anyhow, it was a little hot in there, but
otherwise ok.

Mike Sparks - Just started when i got there.  anyone who has talked to me
about him in the past or last night can figure out what i think about this
guy.  I am not even going to get into how bad of a dj he is because it would
just be a waste of space.  Oops, did i say that?

Halo - pretty good house set.  Did some scratching, some of which was on,
some which wasn't.  Did a behind the back scratching thing that really
seemed more of a strain to him than anything.  This is just not necessary to
take about a minute turning around, getting all positioned, then scratching
the same as you were before.  It ain't a big deal, kid.

Justin Long - i like this guy a lot.  i've been really impressed both times
i've seen him.  He's always really into his sets.  Good house.
Unfortunately, i was too tired from seeing Soul Coughing right before the
party for me to stay much longer.


PROBLEMS WITH THIS PARTY:

Traxx did not show.  There were no lights whatsoever and sound problems all
night.  The party was $15 without canned food, $13 with.  Does anyone else
see something wrong with this picture?

Okay, i am guessing that Baseheads got this space for next to nothing since
Tik Tak used to be way into the punk scene and all of the shows there.  No
money for lights, no more than $150 for sound.  Traxx was not there.  So
we're talking about $13-15 for two somewhat known dj's from chicago.  What
is wrong here?  

That place was packed around peak hour.  Baseheads *must* have made mad bank
on this party or i would be *extremely* surprised.

i probably would have had a better time if i wasn't tired, but it was okay.
A lot of unrecognizable faces there, so that's good.  I, unlike some other
people on this list, do not mind seeing new kids at parties.

=================================================================
Best Buys is the best place in Cleveland for techno CD's?
I see you don't know Cleveland's record shops too well.
Have you heard of Bent Crayon? That's where I, dan curtin,
gank, mike filly, campion, sleepy c, and many many others
get their techno. It's located at 11600 Detroit road (next
================================================================= 

and brian sed:
=================================================================
I agree, I work at Best Buys and the selection is EXTREMELY 
limited....another nice place to buy techno is My Generation on Detroit 
Road in Westlake...they've got just about everything, hope I helped 
================================================================= 

actually i've been to both, but not recently. but the west side
alwaze had better record stores than the east side. but what can
i say i'm an east side boyee (hell, i think it's a pain in the
ass just driving to the west side to go to the brillo pad...
personally i wish sleepy c & campion would bring MUSIC to the
Last Drop here in East Cleveland, not only is the spot closer
to where steve lives, but the space is much better & the bartenders
aren't stuck up & overprice the drinks...i know a few kids that
are boycotting the brillo pad cuz they got sick of the joint...and
they wonder why kids tag the fuck outta that place)...but as far
as east cleveland goes, the Best Buy in Mayfield Hts has one of
the largest selection of techno CD's (not records) @ decent 
prices that i've seen. plus i assume the selection of the amount
of techno depends on who's ordering for them w/in the various
stores...just like how the selection @ World Records in columbus
has improved since Ben aka DJ Atman has started working there...
speakin o which...i gotta give props Ben definitly gets my vote
for one of the better up & coming dj's out of columbus, after
hearing him spin @ one of mary's private partys...coinkidinkly
ben also went to bgsu along w/ my girlie christa and her best
friend lisa from detroit...they were part of the original old
skool bgsu ravah posse that used to frequent that small bar that
omegaman used to spin in toledo before he blew up...were u a part
of the original old skool bgsu ravah posse also?

 hey guys, i thought i would let everyone know what is up for the oberlin 
 party on december 6th. i know that some ppl have been wondering if it is 
 still on.  
 
 ELEVATE, Oberlin OH 12-6-96  $$$ 5 $$$
 the lineup (all confirmed) is :
 
 david hollands (nyc)
 mr kleen (nyc)
 franzen (san fran)
 o'keefe (philly)
 sleepy-c (cleveland)
 fesones (nyc)
 mellowman (ohio)
 12 " player (oberlin)
 
 Location: Oberlin, OH (about 30 min outside of Cleveland)
 	  It takes me about 45 minutes to get to Oberlin from my house
 	  in Highland Hts (far east suburb) ; Oberlin is not far past the 
 	  end of I-480  (rather close actually)
 
 ****ALso: it is really important to note that the party is an AIDS 
 Benefit fundraiser for the Red Hot organization. ALL door receipts (not 
 just profits or proceeds) will go to AIDS research. ALL of your $5$ will 
 go towards AIDS research as far as i know. The students who are throwing 
 this are not going to make any money. 
 
 ****PLEASE READ THIS:
 Anyone who is not from Oberlin College must be on a LIST to get into this 
party. This is not a guest list to get in for free entry, it is just to 
 get in. I know it sucks, but i guess it is Oberlin College policy. 
 However, they have made it really easy for us to get on the list. Call 
 the toll-free number (888) 378-8598 and leave your name or email paul at 
 spd7312@oberlin.edu . They are not allowed to randomly flyer outside of 
 Oberlin, so you probably wont see any flyers for the party (although i 
 think that they printed up nice ones for Oberlin students and their 
 first-hand friends.) I guess last year they had some problems with a punk 
 show on campus that was attended by a lot of off-capus kids, and so this 
 is Oberlin's way of keeping massive hordes of unruly ravers from 
 descending on campus and raising a ruckus by knocking over trash cans and 
 scaring little children and such. ;) 
 
 From what i have been told, all of the techno/house Djs are spinning 
 their normal styles except Mellowman is spinning some acid-jazz/triphop. 
 Franzen is one of San Francisco's fave hiphop djs and this is his first 
 appearance in the midwest. He spins the most popular hiphop show in SF on 
 KMEL 106.1 FM ( http://www.kmel106.com/SPECIALTYShows1.html ) 
 Fesones is a wicked hiphop dj frm Shaolin (Long Island NY)..This is all 
 what i have been told about the party.
 
 
 It is only 5$ and hey, I'll be there. So everyone should come and check 
 it out ;) I have seen the space (I'm not giving it away :P ) and they 
 have this really really really neat piece of artwork in it that you will 
 get to see if you come! 
 
 Anyways, please come out and support these kids. I know that they have 
 worked really hard and have struggled with the administration to get this 
 party to go off, so come out and show them how we all stick together and 
 support each other. PLus you will be doing a good deed by giving your 
 money to AIDS research. Remember to send email to paul with your name and 
 the names of those your are bringing if you want to be able to get in. 
 his email addy is spd7312@oberlin.edu  
 or call (888) 378-8598 (toll-free)
 
 if you have any questions: email paul or talk to him on vrave, his 
handle is joeboy.


 see you guys there!
 
 kate O+

Actually he's an Oberlin student from NY. And I wouldn't call him "wicked"
either, but he does play some decent music. I believe about half the music
is hip-hop to attract more than the about 50 people in Oberlin who might
go to see techno.
And also, probably an all-day afterparty at my place possibly with the
turntables SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING. That's right we've trashed the
apartment and drilled holes in the ceiling, the place is already trashed, 
we'll never get the security deposit back, why not drill holes in the
ceiling? :
Anyway DJing will be:
 Me
 Garic
 Anyone else who wants to bring records.

hi all,

don't mean to be spreadin rumors, but i heard from a friend today that there
will be a new Ohio law due to the American Journal rave story that will
prevent Warehouses from being used for all night dance parties starting the
first of the year.  Also, if one is thrown in a club, it must end by 2am
just like the club would anyway.  

It sounds like bullshit to me but i just wanted to know if anyone else had
heard the same thing?  I don't buy it, but i just wanted to let people know
that this information is going around.

carry on then, carry on....

looks like me and some of the posse will be there for one or both events 
(i'll be at both).  netmeets never work, sorry, but i'm sure we can come 
up with some kind of idea...net stickers or something?  there's a few new 
people i would love to meet, let's not let it slip by!  as for me, i'm 
easy to find: look for a frizzy brown-haired lanky white guy who looks like 
he stepped out of the '50s (with boddy holly glasses and all) and you've 
found me!  heh.  if anyone needs crash space, i might also be able to 
help arrange something for a few people.

and i also want to personally invite anyone who wants to buy some great
cheap records and possibly meet mr mad mike, to stick around on sunday and
go with us to the submerge building (home of underground resistance, juan
atkins, octave one, and many others).  i can guarantee your life will
never be the same, and maybe then you'll understand why i'm always on
about detroit.  it's worth sticking around for (or go on your own, call 
313.963.1025 and make an appointment, or go to the building yourself at 
2030 grand river ave right in downtown detroit, ring buzzer #8 i believe).

oh and have a happy holiday, i almost forgot.

so we bought tickets through Ticketmaster, they said Pontiac
was near Detriot(liars). we left Cleveland thinking it would be
a 2 & half hr drive, it started snowing. got there at 10:45, four
hrs later. missed only fifteen minutes of the Chemical Bros.
set, WELL WORTH THE DRIVE!! it was really loud and they
had a crazy experimental soud,almost all new material.
all the older songs were remixed w/ bass & noise.
the lights/visuals were amazing. even if u dont like them,
the Bros. gave lots of energy, i danced my ass off!!

no this has nothing to do with satellite records or scott whatever his name is.

this is a new breed of satellite parties evolving at penn state. some of us
like to believe that big universities are key alien jumpstations that
transcend time and space...pepsi has done a lot of investing into penn
states culutre.. so their are some alien influences up here, and they only
seem to come out during halfmoons and fullmoons..

anyway....DECEMBER 6th...

Dear ravers across the land & overseas,

	We all have unjust laws in our communities; in Britain they are
much more aware of the political climate because of the Criminal Justice
Act that has targeted ravers and other nomadic people.  
	If we unite, we will be a number of voices too large to ignore,
and there is no better time than the present...

Okay folks, this is a serious situation and a calling to arms!!!

All of you that know Greg know when he says something he's not blowing
shit!

The proposition of buying land has been considered and executed in
southern California. A large plot of land was purchased in the Santa Ana 
hills for the purpose of throwing raves. A road was even built leading
to the space. To the best of my knowledge this effort was unsuccessful.
(anyone with details please fill us in.)

The concept of raising money to change the 2am dance curfew law does not
seem to me to be a completely unattainable goal. Any law on the books
can be changed with enough support, signatures, and donated time and
effort. Take Prop. 215 for example, sure it's a stretch. But I'm sure
all of you at least once were approached by someone at a supermarket to
sign the 215 ballot many months ago.

[[ note to other ravelists: Prop. 215 is the ballot initiative which
passed earlier this month in California legalizing marijuana for medical
use ]]

We have the technology to make change...we have the incentive to make
change...DO WE HAVE THE SPIRIT TO MAKE CHANGE????!???

Sometimes I wonder, Shit gets thrown around the list. People say stuff
but many times nothing happens. I'm not blaming anyone, but if something
*obviously* needs attention should we continue to ignore it?????

This is our scene....this is our time......this is our life...Let's make
it the best we can!

We have made a difference already! Proof postive...Friends and Family,
Harmony, Famtasia, BBQ 'n' Beats, ODP, Elevation, and many other
net-related parties are on the horizon. The CA underground rave scene is
about to explode! Let's give it the resources to prosper.

We have a small group willing to make a difference. We have so many
successful business-minded people on list. Let yourself be known! Let's
not let such an important movement fade away into the abyss of the list.

Anyone interested in this crazy notion please respond and let yourself
be known. Hopefully with enough of us we'll be able to actually make
things happen for a change. 

Crazy thoughts invading my mind,

Terry

I pulled the following from MTV's site:
 
                    MTV Online: MTV's 7 Days of Music (p1 of 6)
    
                                7 DAYS OF MUSIC
   
  			FOR THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 25, 1996        


THE FUGEES have been a hot item on the DJ bootleg circuit, with a
     drum'n'bass remix of their song "Ready Or Not" circulating around 
     the clubs and shops. The Fugees record company, Sony, has issued a
     statement condemning the bootleg and threatening legal action.  
     Britain's music weekly, "NME," says the boot is the work of club  
     artist DJ HYPE, but Mr. Hype has denied the allegation.
