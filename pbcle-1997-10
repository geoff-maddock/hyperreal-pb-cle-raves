i am supposed to DJ at this dance next weekend, + it is a gay dance so me
+ the other DJ are going to play lots of clubby cheese house + some disco 
(which doesn't have much merit musically but it will be fun anyway. i
don't think minimal hard techno (which i usually play) would go over
well at it. people would be like "what the fuck?"). most of the
cheese-house + disco is on records but some of it is on CDs, + i don't
think there will be a CD player with pitch control. 
anyway my point is i thought of a practical use for BPM counters--in case
anybody cares: if you are mixing records then decide you want to mix in
something on a CD but you can't use pitch control, you can use the BPM
counter to count beats on the record at whatever speed it's at, then look
thru your CDs (on which you have determined the BPM beforehand) to find
a track that is a close speed, within 5 maybe, then start it playing and
use the pitch control on the turntable to match the beats (so you'd be
doing it kind of backwards), then mix in the CD. it would be a little
harder than mixing from turntable to turntable, but you could still play
stuff you don't have on vinyl. well i don't have a BPM counter but this is
just an idea i had for a hypothetical situation.

do you mean from downtown kent? or what downtown? anyway, here's the
directions from out of town.

PART 1

from the EAST: take i-76 west to route 43 north (kent/hartville exit),
 follow part 3 of directions 
from the WEST: take i-76 east to route 43 north (kent/hartville exit),
 follow part 3 of directions 
from the SOUTH: take i-71 north to i-76 east to route 43 north (kent
 /hartville exit) then follow part 3 of directions

PART 2

from the NORTH: take i-480 southeast to rt 14 southeast
go 2 miles to rt 43 south
go 6 south miles to kent
turn left/east on crain ave, go over a bridge then railroad tracks
take the right fork in the rd (crain ave)
go 4 blocks southeast, turn right on lincoln st (be careful not to miss 
 this)
go about 1/2 mile to summit st, turn left (diagonal) on to campus
go up a hill, down another hill, thru 2 lights
turn left at the 3rd light. you will see a tall bldg (the library)


PART 3

(continued from south, east, & west)

go about 5 miles north on route 43
go past rt 261 and into kent
go thru about 2 lights
at a light at school st turn right
go east 4 blocks
turn left on to morris rd
go north about 1/2 mile to the light
turn left on to summit st
go thru 1 light and turn left at the next. you will see a tall bldg (the
 library)

PART 4

(parking)
there is a pay parking lot in front of the library & student center. if
you park there, you get to manchester field by walking between those 2
buildings. if it's raining, it will be in the ballroom which is in the
student center. if you want to park someplace else (there is free parking
on some streets near campus + pay parking other places on campus), ask
someone on the campus how to get to manchester field or the library or
student center which are right next to it, or follow the music.

Wonder if someone could help me out.  At TurnTable Terrorisits in
Cleveland a couple of months ago, I belive it was DJ Swamp was spinning a
track with the refrain, "If I'm gonna fuck, we *all* gonna fuck..."
Anybody know who this is?

thanks ahead of time,

here we go again. ....
if you have an event to post, once or twice really should be enough, any
more i really think treads on becoming spam.  i have had ppl complain to
me about it in person and i think they wont post it up here due to one
particular persons tendency to _flame_ anyone who says anything.

anyhow, i've sat back and watched a few ppl post repeatedly the same exact
thing, and ppl have their friends post the same thing from a different
email address.   lets not get carried away or i'll have to think of
something stupid to do to stop this stuff, because.,....quite honestly,,,,
i detest spam......alot.....really.

I think you are wrong.  The definition that I've heard is this:

trainspotter-one who watches DJs play so that they take note of what
records they are playing in order to try and bite their style.

err ... trainspotter comes from england where there where/are people 
who go and spend hours watching trains. They have notebooks and write down
the trains they see, apperently trying to see each train or something.

it has come to mean those folks who stand around the dj booth and
make a note of each track that is laid down

peace

hi, i've just been lurking, but i'm familiar with this word's history:
the term is derived from the hobby of trying to take down the numbers on
the boxcars of trains that go by. there is even currently a small
campaign to improve trainspotting's image in England, featuring
celebreties who trainspot and the English versions of Barbie and Ken
wearing snazzy trainspotting outfits. the activity is, obviously,
totally and utterly pointless,
so the term came to be slang for any totally pointless activity. the
book which was made into the movie "Trainspotting" was thus named to
imply that life itself is totally and utterly pointless. the success of
the movie in America inroduced the use of the term here.  i don't know
the origin of it's adoption into rave culture in reference to watching
djs, which seems from my persective to have more point than watching
boxcar numbers, but i guess nothing really has a point if you think
about it.

I thought a trainspotter was someone who watches to find the latest trends
and tries to "jump on them before they go by?" (in slang terms o'course)

I think that the name "Trainspotters," if the meaning of it means a total waste
of time, should be givin to the people that are held responsible for giving this
name to others. Those are the people that are a waste of time, that have
nothing better to do but judge others and call them childish names. If people
want to go to a party and just watch the dj, do drugs, or whatever, than so be
it. It is a free country and everyone has a right to do whatever they damn well
please and noone should judge them for that. Those so called people that other
so called "ravers" dispise, are not causing any harm to anyone, it's the
"ravers" the judgemental ones of course, that have the real problem!

i am not sure if aaron bennett would necessarily have wanted these

thought these would save some of you a phone call.  i've edited them

Subject: people's revolution directions

from the south, get to I-75 and go north until you reach I-475/US-23
North.  After going on 475/23 for about 10 miles 475 will split off from
23. Stay on 23 heading north towards ann arbor until you get to I-94. Head
west on I-94 for about and hour and a half until you get to the kalamazoo
area.  once in kalamazoo, stay on I-94 until you reach the westnedge ave.
NORTH exit which is exit 76B.  [presumably these will work from all
directions: ie, simply get to I-94 and get off at exit 76B. --ed]

once you're heading north on westnedge, you'll go for about 5 miles until
you reach the 14th traffic light which is patterson ave.  turn right onto
patterson.  once on patterson, you'll go through one traffic light, over
some railroad tracks and come up to a second traffic light which is
pitcher street.  turn left onto pitcher.  go for about 3/4 of a mile. 
the site is in a blue building with st. croix recycling on the side of
it.  this is the last building on the left hand side of the street before
you get to mosel ave.  if you run into mosel, you've gone too far.

any problems, call the voicemail: 616.342.8771

So REVIBE is tonight somewhere in Colombus, Ohio and i intend to be
there... i've never been to Colombus, and i dont know very much abt the
party scene [or the Club scene, if one exists] in the area... but this
party should proove to be rather phat... and should be worth the 4 hr
drive...

i'd like to propose a netmeet... somewhere in the space around 2:30...
i'd say the bathrooms, the mens bathrooms as to get rid of all
confusion, but someone else who has been to this space b4 may know of a
better spot which they are free to propose... i should be checking my
mail up untill abt 7:00 or so tonight so please write back if u intend
to be at this party...

what will i be wearing..? big blue SNUG pants and a tee-shirt, i may
have a large Diesel messenger  bag or a small Polo carry-on\messenger
bag. (probably the former) i also may or may not be waring my septum
ring...

seems rather vage, i know; but its the best i could do at this point.

anyway, hope to see u all there...

all my love and respect,

Costas.

so last night some friends and i pile into teh car and set off for
Revibe in Colombus, Ohio. The 4 hr drive (each way) was well worth it.
This part was an excellent experience.

The space was really nice... some BIG conention center out there.. there
were 2 rooms, but the first room was more of an entance than an actuall
room.. although there were dj's spinning there... it was really more of
a 1 room party. (for those of u who have been to parties at the Asberry
PArk convention Center in new jersey .. this space is much like this
only BIGGER)

when i first walked in, i wasnt sure i would enjoy myself.. there was
this BIG vibe going around but i wasnt feeling any of it. i felt very
isolated.. and this is the worst feeling u can have at a party. i had
never been to colombus b4... or a colombus party for taht matter... so i
wasnt quite sure what to expect. also, i was VERY tired... (we dont
sleep very much here at CMU) ... after walking around for 20 minutes ro
see if i recognised anyone, (which was difficult considering it was
almost pitch-black in the main room) and to fumiliarize myself w\ the
space i sat down in the middle of the dancefloor w\ 2 glowsticks in my
hand crossleged w\ my eyes closed .. all of a sudden, i start to feel
the floor vibrating under me... the music was fucking fat at this point
and i realise that my hands were moving to the music... i touched the
floor and my fingers began to tingle all the way up my spine to the base
of my neck.. YEI... we have VIBE... from that point on this party was
totally increadible. for those of u who care, i was streight - edge the
entire night.


i wouldnt call columbus people supper-ultra-friendly (which are the type
of people i love to be w\ at parties...) but they were super-nice... my
friends and i are polite, u know, wehn i bump into other people (or they
bump into me) i'll appologize (god only knows it was my fault) but i
dont really expect this from other people... u kind of figure thats how
most people will react, but u dont expect it... well the fact that 99%
of the people i came into contact w\ seemed increadibly super nice.. and
didnt have hard-guy attitudes made me feel good beond belief. There were
LOTS of nice people at this party... it was fucking awsome.

anyway... the music was excellent... i dont even remember the names of
most dj's... but they all did an excellent job. Even the House at the
end by dj Bob felt right at 6:00 in the morning when he started
spinning...

some dude (god bless him) came up to me and wanted to have a
dance-fight... (is that what its called?/) u know when u do some moves,
and then some the other person does what he can do and u keep taking
turns... but i politely turned him down for 2 reasons, i cant fucking
dance (although i love to) and i dont think this thing is like a
competition... so we started dancing.. and sudennley we were like all
intertwined... it was fucking wierd... this was going on for abt 15
minutes when i realised there was a small group of people watching us..
surrounding us... i dont like when people watch me dance... simply b/c i
dont think i'm a prime example of a good dancer... well, we were talking
while dancing, it was this dudes 16th birthday like 3 days ago... he
kept complementing me on my skills... which felt great... needless to
say, he was a good fucking dancer. he kept saying "your like water
dude." <---------------------------- u can only immagine how SPECIAL i
felt at this point. i was just feeding off the vibes which surrounded
me..and i danced all night.

the other cool thing abt this party was the presance of little kids...
this kids were like 12 and 13 and they were just having so much fun...
not really dancing, just sitting there admiring (most likely totally
overcome by vibe) u dont see very much of this in ny where most parties
are 18+ and the presance of young kids in clubs is frouned uppon... i
loved it.. it made me feel so good looking at the younger genreation ...
i know these kids are only like 5 or 6 years younger than me.. but, lets
face it your life-span as a [raver] is a very short one...

on a depressing note, i heard that some of them were all tweeked out...
and although i'd think that a dealer would have enough respect for their
youth not to sell them drugs... i guess i was wrong... i think its sad..
there were plenty of people interested in all sorts of shit (including
obviously these little kids) but u'd think that a dealers would be
satisfied to just sell it to the older people. i mean these kids were
VERY young. at least they seamed so to me.


the only bad things were superfficial, the smaller [jungle??] room was
always way too crouded, hot and stuffy. And the main room was a little
too dark.. the lazer light show was nice, but instead of having the
immiges projected on a screen, they were projected onto the write
ceiling which compromises quality b/c of the angles or whatever.. it was
also kind of cold in the main room... although i have been kind of sick
recently so that may be why i felt this way... although i heard others
say the same...

i feell bad for the carpet in the smaller room b/c it was a really nice
one and we were butting our cigarettes all over it. oh well.

overall this was a great party.. i had a great time.. i met plenty of
people... and just got to chill w\ some new-found close friends. i know
of others who missed this one b/c of car trouble and i think that sucks
b/c it was a cheap party... $10 w\ a canned good... which is much
cheeper than what i'm used to anyway. 

shout outs...

jason and dan...
thank u thank u thank u... for the ride, for the canned goods, for the
love, for everything dudes .. this was all your doing... it makes me
feel bad that i wont be going to dynamo b.c i'll be back in ny... b/c i
think i;d rather chill w\ u dudes.

Sarah.. baby.... i love u. 

Abby... u say u had a good time, but i didnt see it. i'm sorry... but i
cant make everything perfect... god knows i tried.

Marrissa and Army man -- is it dave?? ... yei... for smiles, hugs and
kisses. dave... i didnt expect to see u there... it was nice .. very
nice.

Arowhead... how was your 1st party dude... u certainly looked like u
were enjoying yourself.

Alif... baby i looked all over for u towards the end.. did u get home
ok?? sorry i couldnt help out more...

to all the colombus folks... thank u , for an excellent evening.

all my love,

Costas.

			Hi everyone-

	We just redid our tape traders page...we added two new major
areas...
1. "Check your trqade stats"  this page is for those who we are currently
doing trades with...they can check to see if we are still copying tapes,
ready to mail you your tapes, waiting for info from you, etc.
2. A message board for people to trade tapes, write reviews of tapes, and
even for dj's to advertise their new tapes!!

Check it out and let us know what you think...=)
http://www.partnercomm.com/~tapes/

Love -
Nicole & Matt

(hi costas =] !!!)

> for those of u who care, i was streight - edge the entire night.

FYI (or anybody's), being sXe isn't something one can do for 1 nite. it is
a <<permanent>> change to a person's life, meaning abstaining from
certain things forever (there are varying definitions, regarding exactly
what it includes: generally illegal drugs, alcohol, sometimes legal drugs,
promiscuous sex, and/or animal products etc.).

here's a quote i just found:

"Straight-edge is not a fashion. Straight-edge is not only being at a
conert with an X painted on your hand. Straight-edge is all the time,
for your own satisfaction, not for the satisfaction of others." 
              
-some sXers on the web 

by the way i'm pretty much cXe (most people know this. from what i have
read in some newsgroups, that/crooked-edge is the opposite of sXe), but i
respect people who are sXe. i just believe that certain things in 
moderation are ok for me.

the promoter I would appreciate it. Thanks  8).

of mine who goes by Moda (Eric). We have been playing at a number of one off
parties (Raves) in SF and across the U.S.(as far east as New
York,Baltimore,North Carolina,and west coast cities such as LA,Las
Vegas,Phoenix and Portland) as well as in Canada. We are resident's at a
weekly party called Therapy, Strawberry Sunday's and Play off and on at
Spunday's as well as some other weekly local event's.
         Moda and I have been DJing about 14 years, so we are definately not
new to the sceen. My style that I play Is Acid Trance, Acid Breaks and some
Tracky and Progressive. Moda plays Progressive and Progressive Trance

i replied to mizzy about this, but i think alot needs said, and i know
there are a few lurkers on this list from youngstown...

exactly, i really dont feel the need to type this in for her, after the
cheap shots she has taken at me.  and the talking behind my back at me
either, she had the nerve to ask brian to ask me to spin her last party.
what?  does she think i'm that stupid?

>Everyone should try to make it out for this party!!  my friend Cory is

>Y-town!!  
yeah thats a good one, i've been doing this stuff for 2 years and noone
cared for the longest time. now that WE'VE had success here, cory and a few
others started throwing parties.  all fine and good, i honestly dont have a
problem with that.  WHAT I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THAT EVERYONE EXPECTS
US TO SPIN AND DONATE OUR EQUIPMENT (1200S, SOUND, & LIGHTS) FOR FREE.  i'm
more than happy to take out my stuff for a free party or whatnot, BUT WHEN
YOU WANT TO CHARGE TWO AND THREE TIMES WHAT WE DO AT OUR PARTIES, I FEEL
ENTITLED TO GET PAID FOR MY EQUIPMENT.  i honestly am not a charity service
for everyone in youngstown, and honestly i'm not unreasonable about what i
want.  all i really want to do is play music and have people listen or
maybe even dance, and thats what i've been doing here since the beginning.
CHEAP, QUALITY EVENTS IS WHAT WE DO.  2$/FREE FOR OUR WEEKLY AND 5$ FOR A
SOLID NIGHT OF MUSIC.  i think cory's into it for the wrong reasons.

>So come out and support out scene and support Cory...she's a 
>really nice person and she's real...
each to their own opinion i say.

>not two-faced like some of the people around here in Y-town!!!!  
give me one example of how i'm two faced.  i can list the examples of how
cory's two faced, but i hardly find this the forum for it.  email privately
mizzy if you have any questions.

So if you can make it come out!!  It's 
>going to be a really PHAT party!!!!  see you all there!!!
again no comment, i do hope that the djs spinning do get paid this time. i
know kidd joe got paid 20% of the agreed upon money, and cory put him on
the flyer for freake without really confirming him.  i dunno, sounds pretty
sketchy to me.  i've avoided all dealings with cory and company because i
didnt want to get sucked into alot of this stuff, but since cheap shots are
being taken at me i felt obligated to respond.  any other cheap shots
should be aired now, i want to get this out in the open, thank you for your
consideration.
oh and print this one too mizzy. you can pass it around to all your friends
and joke and laugh about it.

there are other youngstown issues, but i wont bore you with them.

sorry for the static, trouty.

Okay.  Upton Sinclair wrote _The Jungle_ in 1906.  At or around that time,
he also sent a cassette of music to accompany the book to Benjamin
Franklin, who was then the ambassador to France.  This tape was labeled
"Jungle" and consisted of very fast, percussive and repetitive music that
Sinclair had composed to try to convey the experience of working in an
automated meatpacking plant (remember, this is in Chicago, which later
became the home of the Hard Core Meat Beat scene).  In Britain, Rudyard
Kipling had penned _The Jungle Book_ in 1894 and was experimenting with
the fusion of "fife and drum" or bagpipe military music with Tabla rhythms
imported from the Indian colony.  Kipling's close friend, Field Marshall
the Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, known also as Rude Bwoy Monty, was
intrigued by the new sounds that Kipling was creating and made a
dubplate to play at social events at the officers club.  The new music
quickly spread to all corners of the then-vast British Empire, thus
creating what we know today as "jungle." So, you see, it's really not as
new as you thought...m@

Yes, Noah is right.  From all reliable reports I've heard, the definition
below is on point.  But get this..the term trainspotte has been around in
Toronto for like 10 years, and it has always meant to be totally strung
out on heroine, which comes from teh scottish usage.  Which I think is
related to the English usage, which gets translated from watching trains
to doing something dumb and useless.  That's what someone from England
said.  

Whew!  i love my etymology!

Hey...I just checked it...it works...maybe they didn't have anything on
the line til now though.  It's not a cell phone, there's a machine
attached to it (maybe voice mail)
I heard it's gonna be at Dieslen Mall.  (hmm...I think that is the same
place as Freee by Udg. Inc, if I'm not mistaken or goin out of my mind!)

the best way to describe this party in a single word... CHAOS... which can
be either great or horrible.. depending on the way one looks at things... i
had a great time at this party... although i must say... its far from the
ideal partying experience oce comes to exxpect when deciding to attend a
particular event.

being too tired to attend the monkey party on satarday night, i opted to go
to boo at Carbon/Mirage although i feel this is one of the worst spots in
the city... i had hoped to go to Wistle, but those plans fell through...

its been a while since i partied in the city... since July 5 i believe
(well, actually that was in jersey) ...and i was rather anxious to see what
i was missing... and the answer is... other than some great music...
absolutely nothing.

this party had almsot no vibe. there were WAY too many people there. even
worse... there were mirage\carbon regulars there... these people came to
see what we freaky [ravers] do when we have fun... although to their
credit.. some of them seemed super ultra open to what they saw and intend
to look into the scene a bit further  (which i think is great)

it kinda puts u in a bad mood when u cant go ten seconds w\ out being
pushed and shoved... it was difficult to dandce b/c of the lack of space...
(although once again, i danced my ass off) and finally this fucking club is
way too dark in some spots... get a strobe-light goddamit.i was walking
around at like 1 mile an hour b/c i wasnt sure there was a step in front of
me or not... it was the wierdst thing.

the music was very well done for the most part... the 2 best sets of the
night IMHO belong to KECH and Adam X... the later once again displaying his
formidable skills at the tables and yet again inspireing awe from the croud
[can u say ROCKED THE FUCKING HOUSE???] At that point... although i had
been feeling some vibe b4 then.. we definitely had a vibe going... too bad
i left right after his set was winding down... (around 6 or so)...

the best part  about the whole night was the fact that i saw a few old
faces which i hadnt seen in a really long time... this one dude who i had
met at vinal a few months ago came up to me... i had no idea who he was and
yet he began to recite my whole life story back to me... in detail. finally
i realised who i was talking to ... but i still thought it was odd... nice,
but odd. I came b.c i wanted to chill w\ my friend andie who i hadnt seen
in like 3 months... and i have to say, she was one of the sasyest people
there... but i kept hearing people talk abt her hair and what see was
wearing... which kind of got anoying after a while... especially, when 90%
of the time, it came from Mirage guido chicks.. u know, the ones usually
the butt of all jokes... but i guess thats to be exxpected at a place like
Mirage.

i saw this dude rob from Phily.. whoc omplemented me on my horrible dancing
skills... i asked him why he didnt go to wistle... and he said something
abt not rusting the producers of the event.. i'm not sure exactly why.. i
didnt ask... he was there w\ his girl,a nd after talking to them for a
while he told me he had an extra bag of k which he wanted to get rid of...
i wasnt too interested myself, and when i told him i was streight edge...
he was like "oh my god, tahts so increadible" ... it felt nice, but i still
dont see what the big deal is... the hugs i got from both of them were very
ncie non the less...

the worst thing about this party had to be w\out a doubt the vast amounts
of alcohol being served... and i mean VAST. Now i dont care if u like to
drink.. i like to drink myself.. but thats rare at parties... then again..
many of the people there tonight were not [ravers] so this was just a night
out dancing at a standard club to them... i saw people puke.. and some of
these people were pucking alcohol... its like.. i understand where the bad
vibe is comming from... saying this, i should add that about an houra fter
i arrived ...and finally realized.. that i most likely wouldnt enjoy myself
that night... i considered getting trashed (on boos) myself... thankfully i
decided against that...

other random acts of wierdness...

there was this rumor the entire evening that someone had jumped off the
balcony on the top floor and had gone to meet his maker... now, c'mon
folks... do u think that this would actually happen... without them
stopping the party... i guess it could.. but i mean, thats so unlikely. 

seeing this chick from my english class at CMU... and getting this big hug
from her w\ out even knowing who she was... i sat there like... "i'm sorry
baby.. but i'm way lost..." she was cool though, she explained it all to
me.

as i was walking around on the balcony outside, this dude who spoke w\
slured speach.. and the alchohol his his breath had kicked into overdrive
pulls out his walet and says something like "i'm a cop, here's my badge..."
and his "buddy's" were like.. "c'mon man, up against the wall.. speard 'em"
... this shit gave me the BIGGEST smile... i sat there trying hard not to
laugh... suddenly he grabs my arm... and says "didnt u hear me.. i'm a
cop... wanna see my badge??" i sat there like... naw ddue... u already
showed me that shit.. i dont need to see it again.. i believe u.... and i
gave him a  hug and walked away. I turned around after taking a few steps
away and saw that guy just sitting there.. all confused. He'll get used to
it.. i hope. 

as i was dancing on the main floor, i saw this chick surrounded by 2 guys
she was kissing one of them, and then she turns around and kissed the other
one... and then a few minutes later, she was kissing this chick who had
been kissing this other ddue earlier. i couldnt help but remember back a
few years ago when this was more common... [can anyone say ... ORGY IN THE
BATHROOM???] ...suddenly the other chick gets up... and i'm no longer
dancing... instead, i find myself sticking my toung way into her mouth...
that was fun.

overall, this was a great night out in the city... i think i'll call it
just that... as parties go... this was a bad one... w\ a multitude of
redeaming qualities... i ended up being steright edge the whole night..
although i had initially intended otherwize... i mean if the amount of fun
i had is any indication... then it was a good party... the music was
good... i got to chill w\ some awsome people... and experienced the chaos
of a typical city club.. it had honestly been a while since i've been to a
regular club for anything other than a party.. so that was nice...
overall.. it was very worth my $25.

Costas.

hey there...

ok -- your definition of straight edge and everyone else's are different.
judging by the bottom paragraph, your definition includes not doing drugs
just for a night or two. that's not the case. not that i am any kind of
expert on being straight edge :) -- but, straight edge is when you
abstain from doing drugs (or alchohol) all of the time. when you tell
someone that you are straight edge, they will probably take it as "i dont
do drugs, ever". that's why the guy that offered you k made somewhat of a
big deal about it. didn't someone get on you about this last time you
posted about being "straight edge"?

Just in case anyone on pbraves has a monster computer with a superfast
inet connection, i thought I'd mention an awesome website i recently
discovered - www.netradio.com

They've got streaming realaudio for just about every 'cool' form of music,
including seperate channels for lots of techno.  Here's just some of the
(no commercial) channels they have: techno, acid jazz, house, house hits,
triphop, hiphop, latin, industrial, drum & bass, bhangra, ambient, and
even stuff like ska, punk, funk and 80's....pretty good selection from
what I'v been listening too so far...

...all them fancy hoo-dats and conflaptions...Dem machines is kwazy! ;P

I don't know about anything raveish on halloween in pittsburgh just
yet...although I know there's lots of other stuff going on that night that
will suck people away.  A traveling renegade would be awesome on halloween
night, since so many people would be outside, in costume, and the po-po
would be pretty busy, as not to be bustin' le'partie.

Some evil d+b and hardcore would hit the spot on the 'eve...I'd like to
spin a party (if you need djs), but I already have plans (though they're
somewhat tentitive).  Good luck though! :)

Well I finally made up my mind about which party to attend on this fun
filled weekend. Think in B-more looks good, but I can't miss phat-o's last
party... seeing I've attended a majority of his Planetary events. 
So if anyone is going to be going thru the Pittsburgh area and could pick
my ass up, it would be oh so kind of them. I will provide gas money and
things of that nature. Please contact me @ 
rkwst9+@pitt.edu


				Thanx

This is just a quick summary of the extra-fine party in Youngstown this
past Saturday.

Other than Youngstown (which is like some nightmarish, Clockwork Orange,
ultraviolent place), I had an outstanding time.  After taking 680 by
accident (the signage is pathetic as is I-80 itself), I finally arrived at
the coffeehouse where the party was being held at about 1:00 A.M.
Although I missed Akron's Joe Kidd, I did manage to catch most of Ian
Mariano, Dreamweaver and Jeff Samuel in the main room.  All were
outstanding and deeply enjoyable!  It's so rare that you get Goa and
Trance at a party in this region, and both were featured prominently.
Jeff Samuel spun some really hot Detroit-style, minimal techno -- which I
also love.

The setting was intimate.  The coffeehouse was very much like the Arabica
in University Circle -- an old frat-esque house converted into a
coffeehouse.  The floors were wooden as was the staircase.  On the second
floor, which featured jungle (at least it did when I checked it out),
there was even a balcony with chairs you could hang out on.  Although the
weather was a little nippy, it made an excellent chill out area just the
same.

The dance floor on the first floor was just the perfect size for the crowd
that night.  There was enough room to dance freely without bumping into
anyone, but the floor looked full at all times.  Although the lighting and
sound wasn't of the kind you'd find at a larger party, it was more than
adequate.  The lights on both sides of the dj booth were colored and
rotating, swooshing the dance floor in reds, greens, oranges, yellows and
purples.  There was even a smoke machine.

I'm not sure what the total turnout was, but I'd guess in the 75 to 100
range.  It felt like a tight, house party thrown by your best friends.
All in all, I loved it and hope that the promoters made their investment
back (so they can do it again really soon).

Braden

Hey all:
	I was at dynamo last weekend, and saw a person that had these
balls that were extremely cool.  They were clear, and had red lights
inside that spun around while lit.  They seemed to be pretty solid,
because the guy that had them was bouncing them off the ground.  He would
hit them together and they would turn on.  he may have just been turning
them on at the same time that he hit them together just to look cool, but
I'm not sure.  I would really like to aqquire some of these, so if
anybody knows where to get them/what they are called/ or whatever please
write me.

Thanks,

ABSOLUT

And to think all these years I've been going to the Trilogy on the West
Bank of the Flats -- man, I guess I've been missing out. 

Braden

BTW, how much is this thing going to be?  Is anyone from the list going?

Trilogy IS on the West Bank of the Flats, so please excuse my confusion.  I
don't know about the cover charge, but I would guess it to be around $10 --
give or take a couple of bucks.

hahaha. my balls are also:

"extremely cool", "pretty solid", and so big that they are "bouncing...off
the ground". just kidding. =]

sorry, but i don't know where you could upgrade your set of balls. making
your balls glow red though might require several 1000 volts of electricity
and could be harmful to your health or cause death or disfigurement. ;D

I heard that Hills^tm has Glowing Balls.  Try Sharper Image^tm and get even
trendier balls.  I don't see what the big deal was; why would you unsub from
a list simply because someone wants to get some ( i see why you used
'acquire') balls?

I saw that kid too and I thought he was stupid due to his balls.

Please think about this. Trilogy stoped booking tallent about 2 years ago.
But now it seems really profitable. And Kamel offers a show to them for
very little loot, so they can peddel there squares to people. Hmmmmm
Mean while in the rest of raver land, promoters have to put up their own
loot to get shows to go off, risking there rent payments, if the party
dosn't go off well. While on the other hand, Trilogy dosn't really have to
worry about it.
REMEMBER if we don't keep the loot in the rave scene by supporting the
right people,(ie. people who really support the scene back!) the scene will
not grow in a positive way. Please really think about giving $10 or more to
a club that hasn't given you anything in the last few years!! Don't be
suckered into a show that is so oriented towards a tobbaco company and a
huge club taking your hard earned money away!

PROPS- to all the promoters that put on quality shows, and even when a
losing show happens feel compeled to do it all again!
Peace & respects,
Stephen CInch

I'll skip any flames about spelling, and improper grammar, and the 15 posts
about the one-year anniversary of MUSIC to the list.



I seem to remember reading an article in some local rag about you and Dan
Curtain where the two of you dissed Trilogy previously.  I personally don't
care about Trilogy, but I *DO* question your motives for this hatred and your
outlash on an otherwise fun event.



>>Mean while in the rest of raver land, promoters have to put up their own

>>dosn't go off well. 

In said article it was stated that cigarette companies have given the "scene"
thousands of dollars.  Including parties that you or Dan have either promoted
or played at.  (guilt by association) This in itself seems a bit hypocritical
of your attack on the "commercialism" of the underground community.



>>REMEMBER if we don't keep the loot in the rave scene by supporting the
>>right people,(ie. people who really support the scene back!) the scene will
>>not grow in a positive way. 

I don't think over the course of the past few years that scene has grown in a
positive way regardless.  It certainly is not controlled venues and
nightclubs that have brought in the violence I am seeing at many parties.
 The drugs and media are what have sensationalized the "RAVE" scene not the
fact that clubs play underground music.  I know that many people who go to
clubs are not welcome in the scene due to their commercial looks.  The #1 one
thing I hear out of the "underground" people is "Oh, that's *SO* commercial".
 How positive is that?  Yes I even heard that about this Moonshine Tour.  



Kamel has indeed begun to capitalize on the club and underground scenes.
 Since the mainstream media and government has rejected them... they have no
where else to turn but the underground.  At the rate things are going, in a
few years it will be illegal to purchase cigarettes and they will become as
underground as raves once were.  

As far as Trilogy goes, I agree wholeheartedly that they have NOT given back
to the scene and for that, there really is no excuse.  It is quite possible
that the promoters they have dealt with in the past have made an exhorbitant
commission and the club has chosen NOT to deal with that any more and
Kamel/Camel has presented a new option for them.  I don't know if you
personally have approached the club with an idea for an event or not.   I DO
know that with the dramatic increase in popularity of "straight edge" and the
options of drug use as opposed to alcohol, night clubs will HAVE to start
charging higher cover charges in the near future.  I suppose people will have
to choose whether to go to just parties, to just clubs, or both.  I
personally like both. 

I have much respect for you and the other promoters out there in the world.
 Without you there would not be a scene of any sort.  The same goes with the
DJ's.  I do feel strongly that being a dj and a promoter do not mix in this
day and age.  I see this lending to a stale scene when it is the same
promoters booking the same dj's.  I also see the ESTABLISHED promoters
purposely booking a "name" and a bunch of dj's they KNOW are lame to make
themselves look better.  In many other cities the promoters have been working
WITH the big clubs.  I heard that Cleveland *IS* starting to see some of this
to a degree.  Maybe this will add a new freshness to Cleveland.  Once again I
have to question the motives of this attack on Trilogy.  Especially when
(since the beginning of it ALL) I have seen many of the people who have
respect in the underground push the newbies AWAY from the club scene by their
incessant bad-mouthing of it.  For a good scene it ALL has to work together
and in Cleveland it surely doesn't :(

I just don't don't understand your attack on this event.  If you choose to
boycott something because it is commercial... then do it because its a major
record label capitalizing on the commercial success of its once underground
product.  Not because of a bad promoter or venue.  And if you ever become
commercially successful to the point when you ARE making money...I hope karma
comes back to haunt you.  The people who choose to go to Moonshine are
*supposed* to be going for the music and the party.  Not the politics.
 Eliminate politics and the scene WILL progress.

i'm jumping into this in the middle, so i may have missed 
something...probably in fact, but i feel compelled to 
coment on some things i noticed in an unusually well 
written argument:

>

from the few people i know who organize 216 events and who 
are involved in some way with Trilogy and Church, it's a 
simple fact that people will come to the club regardless of 
if they have Rob Sherwood or somebody who costs a thousand 
bucks.  the more likely they are to have an underage crowd, 
the higher the cost of admission.  like most clubs, the 
long portion of their money is made on alcohol sales, not 
door.

> personally have approached the club with an idea for an event or not.   I DO

you DO NOT appear to know that neither sXe nor the 
proportion of people who use drugs only vs. those who drink 
alcohol is neither new nor growing.  perhaps you're doing 
more drugs, perhaps your peers are doing more drugs, and 
perhaps you're drinking less, but i garuntee that 
nightclubs, especially Trilogy, is not going to have any 
kind of problem paying it's bills because of it.  see those 
dancing girls?  those ugly things bring enough guys to 
trilogy who buy enough drinks that the club could stay open 
on that basis alone, i'd bet.  all of that said, i canNOT 
understand why on earth Trilogy is full to packed every 
single time i go there.  it's a nasty club with no 
atmosphere and the clientele is about 85% testosterone.  
the sound system is okay and the light show is decent for a 
club but for the most part the DJ's aren't impressive and 
have no rotation.  (i didn't say they don't have skills or 
are bad people)  perhaps someone could shed a little light 
on that for me.

> to choose whether to go to just parties, to just clubs, or both.  I
> personally like both. 

i do too.  it's like: some days i want to wear a sweater, 
some days i want to wear a jacket.  different things for 
different mindsets.
 
> I just don't don't understand your attack on this event.  If you choose to
> boycott something because it is commercial... then do it because its a major
> record label capitalizing on the commercial success of its once underground

your logic fails me in your closing paragraph to a 
well-worded and decent argument.  why ask people to boycott 
any event because a longstanding underground record label 
is involved and that recordlabel has persued the American 
Dream (aka, capitalism and success through doing what one 
enjoys) during a time when this style of music has grown 
significantly in mainstream popularity.  i don't know about 
worldwide, but in this midwest moonshine records has 
brought much of the 'rave music' out to the street with 
CDs, cassettes, giveaways and such.  i don't work for them 
nor particularly care for the genres of music that they 
have put out in recent years, but i respect thier work 
in the scene i've seen.

> product.  Not because of a bad promoter or venue.  And if you ever become

actually, these are two TERRIFFIC reasons to boycott an 
event.  i think (hope) that you got your logic reversed 
here when you wrote this.

> commercially successful to the point when you ARE making money...I hope karma
> comes back to haunt you.  The people who choose to go to Moonshine are
> *supposed* to be going for the music and the party.  Not the politics.

you yourself have pointed out several ways that the scene 
has gotten away from the music, but you fail to mention the 
shift in intrest by the partygoers from the music to the 
chemicals.  at least in the degeneration of the party scene 
(you did touch on that with respect to the club scene).

>  Eliminate politics and the scene WILL progress.

true.

and i seem to remember getting flamed and threatened for saying much the

Yo what's wrong with posting an event once or twice a week. A few reminders
always help me remember something.
 Oh yea, and "you have been warned"??  Think about that again my friend,
think if you really want to say that.

I know that sXe and drug use is not new to the rave scene.  I have seen MANY
people as of late jump on the sXe bandwagon.  I always saw it more often at
parties, but as of late I am noticing more and more frequently in clubs.  I
know quite well that the drug scene has been a part of both scenes for a long
time.  The thing I notice lately is that drug use has become secondary to the
music.  Maybe that is a poor choice of words, but from my past experiences I
have used drugs to enhance my mood or the music.  I am seeing people comatose
in the middle of the dancefloor more and more increasingly.  From what I see
there is no doubt that alcohol sales in clubs have been hurt in the past two
years.  I have watched many clubs raise their drink prices and monitor
alcohol pours due to the decrease in alcohol sales.  I, personally, would
rather pay the higher cover charge as opposed to increased drink prices.
 Unfortunately Trilogy has chosen dancing girls in cages as a draw to
increase the beer drinking clientel.  They have effectively ruined the
atmosphere that drew me to the club in the first place. 


>>your logic fails me in your closing paragraph to a 
>>well-worded and decent argument.  why ask people to boycott 
>>any event because a longstanding underground record label 

I made this statement to *hopefully* point out that the logic used in asking
people to boycott this event was similar to the logic of boycotting a
longstanding underground record label.  I definately do no support the
boycott of moonshine, nor was I trying encourage people to do so.  In fact,
maybe I was trying to get people to question whether or not boycotting the
event was similar to boycotting those artists?


>>you yourself have pointed out several ways that the scene 
>>has gotten away from the music, but you fail to mention the 
>>shift in intrest by the partygoers from the music to the 
>>chemicals.  at least in the degeneration of the party scene 
>>(you did touch on that with respect to the club scene).
I meant to include both the club and party scene.  I am disgusted with the
drug use in the party scene specifically because the users have STOPPED
dancing and just sit around and enjoy the "buzz".  This has been comming into
the club scene more and more increasingly.  I think that if you are to
drugged up to dance, socialize, or whatnot, then you should be doing that at
home or at parties with friends.

ok...i really didn't want to get drawn in.....i just kept trying to delete
all the posts re keoki...but damn...ok....here goes

i have been going to parties for years...and i have noticed over the last 2
or 3 an important (to me ) point:

>>> everyone keeps pointing at other groups saying "they are ruining MY
scene"............hold up champ-----
-----i hate to go fast times at ridgemont high on you all..but if you're
there and i'm there and he's there and she's there...isn't it OUR scene?
clubs and parties are 2 different venues.......clubs are going to have
people drinking at them...period...don't like it ...don't go....if it makes
you mad cause you can't get in to see a show...press harder for underage
shows (no alchohol)..but be prepared to pay more...they are
businesses...not a rave helper network.....concerning drug use....no its
not the most important thing at a party...far from it...but it IS a
part...it always has been...the music is the most important thing, but if
seeing people take drugs makes you uncomfortable, again don't go....or push
harder for private venues w/ active drug enforcement...make it really a "no
drug party"...it can be done, and you can keep it that way with ease, if
you have any contact with us "little people" and spread the word.....or go
to the "sponsored events"...ie lucky strkes and budweiser present keoki and
moby or whatever...and if anyone really wants to make changes to the
scene...do something...stop bitching.....i remember when it took
participation from the crowd and promoters and dj's to get anything off the
ground...it was a quantum event that sprang to life...now it takes flashy
flyers and a promise of 3000 gigawatts of lighting to draw a crowd...hey
...scene's change...if you stay stagnant you die...wow i just realized i
just sent the MONSTER post...and i apologize for those people on the list
who really just want to use it to find party venue info, trade tapes, and
form a "scene"...even a virtual one : )
i just feel that the scene is being ruined by infighting and finger
pointing.....but hey...i'm not here posting to make us all pull together
and comprimise...i'm hoping that maybe someone will get my point (that
seems to be hidden in all this garbage= Þ)....don't like it....do
something...find like minded peple and throw your own gig...try to promote
a party...its easy to armchair quarterback....but try it for real...in
other words...stop making NOISE and make an EFFORT

peace...really...

what if everyone here who has events posted them 2-3 times a week,,,,, we'd
have a list of advertisements for events, and possible discussion about so
many events, and a little actual discussion sprinkled in.

> Oh yea, and "you have been warned"??  Think about that again my friend,
>think if you really want to say that.
i've said it 2 or 3 times now, i didnt say much about the 8 or so posts
about musics, but when i've heard it in person (not email) from about 5 ppl
i think it says alot. for my last party there was maybe 2 posts over 3
months about it.  you never hear me posting about my weekly thing, even
when we had terry mullan at it (if you can call it that).  you can flame
out at ppl, but dont seem to like getting it back.  as for "you have been
warned", yeah, i'm a real threat....   *shesh* talk about defensive.
heck since its ok to remind ppl 2-3 times a week about events, maybe i'll
send the rom every day.  you know keep people current and all (p.s. hope to
get the R0Ms script fixed this week!)
_nevermind_

WILL BOTH OF YOU CHILDREN PLEASE SHUT THE fuck UP?

thank you.  i moved off of mw-raves because i could not 
tolerate the inane conversation, but i'm not sure what to 
call this that i've moved into.

so each of you go to your corner and take a moment to 
consider how you're filling up MY mailbox with this 
bullshit.

steven, you are required to spend at least fifteen minutes 
browsing the news.admin.net-abuse sites. take a look at 
what happens to people who misuse the bandwidth they've 
been given access to.  don't be a victim.

trouty: http://www.self-gov.org   we can get along and have 
a relatively happy list without your heavy handedness.

use your head,

speaking of logic, if you eliminate politics, you might as well have to
eliminate all these damn people. :P  i dont think your seriously implying
that we must progress by eliminating integrity, reputations, and those
"people" things that seem to come up when you try to organize people to
come and dance for you, i just think that politics are pretty firmly rooted
into humans in general.

come to think of it, the only way to have a rave type atmosphere without
politics is when everyones all smacked out or on k wondering why they
happen to find themselves being a human when they know they really are part
of some elaborate computer program. only then is it possible to be in a
room with a lot of people without politics.

ummm, lets see, i've said in 10 months:
1) no out of area stuff, ie, dc, night club guest lists FOR NYC, frat
parties in CALIFORNIA, dj bookings for DJ HARDWARE, dj bookings FOR
ARIZONA.  et al..
2) no repeated postings of the same stuff.
i hardly call my list of stuff heavy handed, heavy handed might include:
i) no swearing
ii) no name calling
iii) no soliciting
iv) no slandering
really the only ppl that were against 1 & 2 were/are the ppl doing them,
some not even listmembers.

why should they stay home and get fucked up??? i think if they getting
fucked up, they might as well be listening to dope ass music and loud sound
system pumpin and all that... i mean
why not get fucked up at a place where everyone else and theyre brother is?
why not support the promoter with your state of unpresence?  they paid to
get in right?  i think its funny that a lot of people go to parties or
clubs to get fucked up and just\ sit in a chair and tell everyone that
somes near them just fucked up they are.  silly, i know, but a very common
reality these days..

frankly i wish mroe people would grace us with their presence at local
venues in pittsburgh like laga and steel jungle. its too bad becuase the
cigarette companies have taken control of the dj's here... the over 21
scene is thriving these days... i would rather the cracked out ravers stick
with other ravers than stay at home. granted the security sucks at a lot of
places, but really now i always thought it was the more the merrier!

which really is getting to me now that i actually typed that.... i meant
WHATS UP WITH ALL THIS NEGATIVITY??  at best there are about ten people on
this list that type really phat reviews and about 25 who ocassionaly jump
with an AMEN or a happy message.. the rest are like me and like to start
shit by typiing a really evil or enlightening message. come to think of
it,, i must say that I LOVE THE PEOPLE THIS LIST BUT WHERE iS THe SPiRiT??
maybe im trying to do something i cant but i really wish people in the
rave scene would at least act like they know better than to become a drug
addict! drug adicts are just people with a dimented sense of spirituality
that have a problem with drugs.. however most ravers, addicted or not have
the personality neccessary for a dependence on something spiritually
soothing, not spiritually frightening... soo what im getting at is if we
need something like that.. why cant it be love??

it seems like theres no love to *being* a raver anymore...well at least
most of the people i hang out with are in the scene becuase of inertia.
well how much momentum is left before we have to start cleaning up our
acts?? shit.. imagine if all those things we might have read or heard about
the rave scene became  a perma thing.. something to pass down to the
younger generation.  you know those really really positive things about
being apart of advanced culture.. about being able to mutate to a better
being.... about being a kid and having fun....i havent seen much fun and
advancement in the rave scene lately.

for a while the rest of the world really thought we were doing this as an
alternative to all those bad things we could be doing... then all these
things we are doing became the bad thing.. its not just 2020 and a current
affair.. maybe its the fact that we dont know how to stay underground. NO,
thats a dead end arguement... but eventually i guess people started to
either a) become jealous of our happieness or b) angry at our apathy to
normal issues. lets face it, raving is NOT normal...

        think of all the people our age. think of how many of them consider
alcohol and reefer pretty good drugs for our souls becuase they clog our
minds. then there is us, and we consider loud as hell music and mind
expanding drugs good for our soul... ARE WE THAT EVIL?? the answer is YES!!
WE ARE SATANiC becuase we worship technology and the trance state!!  i dont
believe that, but a lot of normal people would given enough information
about the current state of our scene. when it comes down to it, there are
so many other successful businesses and organisations that are just as
dependent on technology.. were just sorta depedent on electricity....thats
nothing new either!!! shit man,, raving is probably the oldest activity
known to man....o=-0-=o... i wish more people could see that.

well i apologize for my spew of nonsense..
lately ive seen things through very strange eyes if you cant tell... i cant
seem to ever be happy with my social situation yet i know i have awesome
friends.. shit.. all this writing and waiting  in vain is making m   e very
ill you see i must leave for now...

just as a response to what pete said...

i was talking to a friend today... and he told me that the scene here in
pittsburgh is dying... and i suddenly had like this great revilation...
i realised that he was probably right... i feel like i have just caught
the tail end of it.. and that in another few years there will be nothing
left... i had never really thought about this b4, but all i can say is
that its not as fun to be a [raver]any more... we need to reinvent this
scene... in pittsburgh... i know there's some fucking talent out
there... why dont these people spin at parties...? i'm trying to think
of what can be done... my friend said we need to start a production co..
or at least start playing a more active role in the planning of
parties.... the first on is, at least for me, totally out of the
question... but the second one.. maybe. Now i wasnt at Dynamo.. but
everyone who went told me they loved it.. or that they at least had a
good time... i think there is hope for our scene.. i think we can save
it.. but we ned to change it.... because its getting fucking stail
pretty fast.

Is there anyone who lives (or is passing through) pittsburgh and can
possibly give me a ride to cleveland this friday.. i'd like to go to the
Keoki party.. (i forget the name of it at the moment) and i just
realised that my ride fell through... (i have a way to get there, but no
way to get back.. so its as if i have no ride at all...) i'd really
apreciate if anyone could help me out... i'd be more than happy to help
out w\ gas money, munchies, etc...

we are proud to announce our return to the grant and gay basement space
here in columbus.  those of you who have been around for a while will
remember this space fondly.  it still looks pretty much the same.  those
of you new to the space will help create new memories. 

directions:

from the NW take 23 S to 270 E to 71 S to 670 W, follow 23 S/third st

from the NE take 71 S to 670 W, follow 23 S/third st

from the S take 71 N through downtown to 670 W, follow 23 S/third st

from the E or W take 70 to downtown, find 71 N to 670 W, follow 
23 S/third st

once on third st follow it S for 3 lights, to long st.  go left on long 
and follow it for 3 more lights, then go right on grant.  take grant one 
block to corner of grant and gay.  space is the basement of the apartment 
building on the far left, 56 n grant ave. 

admission is only $6.00, and will go up to $9.00 shortly after 12 midnight.

keep in mind that the space will not be heated except by human bodies so
dress appropriately, and be aware that the only bathroom facilities will
be a port-a-potty located outside the space (except for absolute
emergencies of course). 

finally, mary watts is unlikely to be able to spin her set due to a family
emergency.  her roommate, dave mak, will be the likely replacement. 

hope to see a few of you there.

Ok peeps,
I really think this scene needs some more underground parties... esp.
cheap underground parties... all you need is a couple of djs and a nice
big basement... oh, and someone to promote the hell out of it...
now I know that pittsburgh cops can be a bitch, but something that was
done in seattle was that when promoters were doing a small party they
would just put up a sign "private party: by invitation only" and try to
sell most of the tickets presale so that most of the licensing hassle,
etc. could be avoided...
what happened to that hausprojekt thing anyway? it was in a bad space,
but it was a good idea... 
I think if seattle was able to maintain at least 1 party per weekend,
pittsburgh should be able to do it as well...
I am encouraged by such scene building things as the opening of
hypervinyl (which is hella convenient for us cmu kids), radio carson,
and the continuance of steelcity though...
oh yeah, I'm also the rpm director at wrct, so if there are any
promoters who want us to give away tickets for their parties, they
should email me... we'd be more than happy to do it...
hugs...
Erica

Definitly not a spew of nonsense! In fact I'd venture to guess that
there's a lot of peeps on this list who feel about the same way.  Perhaps
we're just less vocal? :)  Whatever the case, I still belive PLUR and the
idea of just bein' happy with yourself, and if you're not happy...change
stuff :)

i've been going to raves here in pittsburgh since '94, and i have
seen this scene slowly deteriorate into nothing but 5 old skoolers,
50 wannabes, and 500 druggies.  

the last rave i was at was bounce, and i honestly could care less if i 
go to another one.  i havne't been to too many out of town parties, so
i can't compare very well.  all i can say is that pittsburgh is in DIRE
need of some scene.  heck, i don't even care if it's not a rave scene.
i've watched the industrial/goth scene fall parrallelllllll as well....hell.

i am a pessimistic person by nature.  but i can put up with the wannabes,
the uneducated, the druggies, the swindlers, etc.....the one thing that i 
CAN NOT put up with, and WILL NOT put up with is the lame ass 
music that i seem to hear cumming from every dj in pittsburgh!
wishy washy house and slow trance.  the same old tek step.  lame uneventful dnb.
and an occasional chemical brothers-esqu set...whatever you call that stuff.

no dj seems to have any nrg any more.  they don't seem to hype the
crowd.  the music is dull, and lifeless.  and most importantly:  NO FREAKIN'
DJ IS WILLING TO TAKE THE CHANCE AND BE DIFFERENT!!!!!!!!
at least from my point of view.  sometimes i kick myself for spending money
on a computer and equipment, and not buying vinyl, because i would love
to spin live and show all the junior high kids that there is MORE than what
they are being experienced to.  so much more.  there's no passion in pittsburgh
because there's no passion in the music that is being played.

i have no real idea on how to change the "scene" in pitt.  i'm just saying
what bothers me the most about it.  kinda fruitless, i'll agree.  
but anyways, if you got any suggestions, or would like to trade tapes of
music that you won't hear at a pittsburgh party or club, mail me or the list.

thanks,
love,

To all caught up in the little tiff over my post a few days ago, I appoligize.
Basically, all I wanted to do was to make people think about an event. I
wasn't asking for a boycott. Sometimes information needs to be said even if
it offends people. And the fact that other clubs in cleveland who are at
least a bit more supportive of our scene are doing low numbers, seems to up
set me. I mean when a Jungle legend like Peshey comes into town and 160
people turn out.... um wow??!!
But a pile of people will go to Trilogy to see a show. Please don't get me
wrong, if you love Keoki, or Cirrus  go! Have fun. Gods speed. But if your
just looking for something to do, there are other alternatives.
Once again sorry for the text abuse.
peace & respects,
s.

Hey Ryu,


There are more techno records (non-trance, non-jungle, non-house) being 
sold thanks to Trevor's store Hypervinyl. I think techno is rising a 
little slowly as there are a few deejays who buy it from his store 
(including myself, who buys the most hehehe), and for Trevor the 
Instigator's hard techno sets. Maybe give the new deejays some time to 
earn their skills, and meanwhile let's just keep throwing parties (so I 
and others can play, hehe). More people are feeling the energy of 
hard techno thanks to Instigator's sets. He played at Dynamo at 3 am 
after Boo WIlliams and he really got the party going; I heard people 
were banging their heads near the speakers :) He made Boo Williams look 
bad.

I spin quality techno, so if anybody would like a copy of my latest 
tapes for sale or trade, which kicks ass (in my humble opinion) than 
e-mail me. I'm also up for doing gigs. If you're curious what my style 
is check my tape!

about the scene - i think the thing in pittsburgh is smaller house 
parties, I don't know I don't go to much. I'm also turned off by the 
bigger parties and all the fucking substance abuse, I agree that it's 
all gotten out of hand.

I think it's easy to post ideas and our thoughts over the Internet, but 
it isn't really gonna change anything unless we act. Meaning, let's 
throw more parties. I'm willing to play for no fees in Pittsburgh if 
it's convenient for me and if it'd help the promotor cut even on a 
party.

Peace,
Paul/djrome

I got the Chris de Babylon LP (not on Grand Royal, but on DHR-Britain). 
He's got his own style of breaks, not as hard as Alec Empire but he's 
unique. It's a good record.

Well, kids,

Just to dispell all questions about whether or not Daft Punk would be
playing at Jack-O-Land in Chicago on Halloween, I called Virgin REcords
and got the straight-up story right out of the horses mouth, so to
speak. According to their publicist they definitely have NOT been booked
to play in Chicago. 

So I'm really disappointed, but at least we know.

I agree - more small parties are what we need.  Big parties are sometimes
more fun, but small parties are better for gettting to meet people and
often have a good vibe.  I'd be willing to play anyone's smaller parties
for free too.  I can't promise 100% smooth mixing, but I definitely put
thought and energy into a set.  I spin hardcore of all styles and hard
jungle.

Though I don't have the time for it right now with school and stuff - how
about this idea - a small party organized by the members of this list?  I
think we collectively have the idead, probably the resources.  I'd be
interested and willing, though a week or two to get me past midterms would
help. :P  As usual, just laying out the thoughts. :)

Have a fun day all. :)

Indeed, this is one of the best things for the scene - a store with
variety and a good listening policy!  Trevor, no matter how frustrated he
gets - does lots of good stuff for Pittsburgh.  People were going mad to
his set @ DYNAMO!  It was great!!  

Since this hasn't been directly said (and since I've thought back on in
more since), DYNAMO was an awesome rave!  The funny thing (at least for
me) is that the part I enjoyed least was the jungle.  The space was the
same as FREE, which is a supreme ghetto mall - as perfect a space as there
is in Pittsburgh.  The main room wasn't moving me @ first, TikTak &
K.Cunningham have been good in the past, but their set just sounded stale
to me...still the dropped some good tunes.  Boo Williams has skills, but
isn't really my thing...although i was getting into some of the hard house
in the middle of his set.  The second room was surprizingly good the times
then the first room wasn't - I was lovin' the booty house going' on.
Simply Jeff was simply phenominal!!  His breaks were so varied and had
lots of samples, vocals and everything!  He even dropped a jungle track on
really slow speed.  In the wee hours, Product 19 made my night with some
haaard as hell acid trance!  I wish I wasn't a zombie then, but dems is da
breaks.  

Ok, that wasn't my intention with my post, but there you go. :)
I'm not sure what's going to happen if/when Product 19 (aka House of
Styles) moves to Toronto.  I'm sure other promoters will rise up...they
always seem to.

Hey KidZ,

  Wasn't sure if anyone would be interested in a IN rave, considering this is
a pb-cle, but I got this today from benharri@indiana.edu, I just thought
maybe someone would be interested..

Don't quote me on this, but I'm pretty sure that Joshua Ryan is the dj
formerly known as Formation.  I guess he hasn't been spinning parties
because he's gotten into production, although I haven't seen/heard any of
his tracks that I know of.

I agree wholeheartedly with you.  Big raves have, to put not too fine a
pint on it, too much noise to talk to people, let alone get to know them.
My lip-reading isn't that good, though I will admit it's been improving.

I would spin for free, too.  I spin, well, everything.  I don't know how
many people caught the Projecthaus parties (does Mike still throw them?),
but I'd love to jump into the fray once more.  I can promise one funky-ass
set, and that's all I can promise.

A get-together for the local family, as it were?

I can help with the logistics.  I don't know about hardware, as my rig's
pretty hacked up, but if the tech needs mods, I can do my best.

Nothing  is wrong with posting an event more than once....with a list like
this filled with post after post and responses to post after post its hard
not to loose some of the facts in amongst the jabber.....either way... after
all the talk about this particular event....does anyone have a comment on how
it turned out..I wasnt able to make it.

joshua ryan is josh topolsky, aka opus, aka dj formation. he produced a
record with rampant records this summer, and has been working on some
other stuff too. he decided to change his name to joshua ryan because that
is what is going to be on the record that he put out.

Sorry for being a bit off topic -
   
I'm in the market for some (one or preferable a pair) direct drive,
pitch-controlable turntables, used or new.  Anyone looking to get rid of
or sell some, or perhaps reccommend a good place to purchace.

Techniques 1200 mk2 are preferable, but anything else with comparable
performance would be just as good for me.

thanks much,

because most of you probably don't know me (except for my 
occasional smartass post to this list), i'll skip the 
introduction because it's not important...except to tell 
you that the ideas expressed in this thread about small 
free or low-cost parties where everybody pitches in and 
everybody is a part of the affair are what [Top Secret] is 
all about.  so count us in with whatever we can do. talent? 
(check!) gear? (check!) communication? (check!) what we 
don't have in the cleveland area is a _SPACE_ to hold an 
event in.  it doesn't have to be large, it doesn't have to 
be elaborate, it just has to be apropriate (ie, soundproof 
enough or far enough away from other people to negate the 
noise leakage).  and of course, the price has got to be 
minimal in order to hold an event without charging or to 
charge less than five dollars (the most expensive event 
we've ever been responsible for in three years of existence 
was three dollars).  oh yeah, these events are full on high 
quality events and they are NOT funded by drugs and they 
are NOT funded by huge "rave" events.

as soon as somebody mentions they have a lead on a good 
space that fits the requirements, pick a date.  it's on.

Subject: {pb-cle} FREE cd of my own original electronic music
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

hello all,
    i recently put together a cd of my music.  it's a collection of
re-worked versions of some of the stuff i've done over the past
2 years. everything has been re-worked, and re-recorded to hard disk,
so if you have ever heard any of my stuff before, this is different.
    if you haven't heard my music before, i guess it can be described
best as "hardcore".  that's pretty vague though.  i work at different
tempos, and with different types of sounds.  some might be called
gabber, some might be jungle, some might be techno, but be
forwarned...this is not dancefloor music.  every song i write has a 
specific meaning or message, and is very personal to me.  i like
to do theme songs for my characters, or sometimes for other
characters...like "hikage" from the pb-cle compilation.  
     even that song has been re-worked for this cd.  there are a total
of 11 tracks on the disk, along with a full color insert and that jazz.
my goal is to have as many people hear this cd as possible, that's
why.....................

     I'M GIVING THEM AWAY COMPLETELY FOR FREE!
i believe that music should be as free as possible.  my tiny label,
Shoryuken! Records, is dedicated to non-profit releases.

     to get a copy of my cd, all you have to do is send me an address
of where to ship it to, AND PROMISE ME that you will make TWO
copies of it onto tape (or cdR) and give those copies to TWO
different people who don't already have a copy....preferably, two 
people in another state.  i will enclose j-cards with the cd so you won't
even have to make them.  
     if for some reason you do not wish to make that promise to me,
you can buy a copy of the cd for $5 postage paid.  let me know if this
is what you choose to do.

thanks for letting me blatantly advertise like this.
i'm looking forward to some replies.  you can't go wrong really.

love,
ryu

Sorry for being a bit off topic -
   
I'm in the market for some (one or preferable a pair) direct drive,
pitch-controlable turntables, used or new.  Anyone looking to get rid of
or sell some, or perhaps reccommend a good place to purchace.

Techniques 1200 mk2 are preferable, but anything else with comparable
performance would be just as good for me.

thanks much,

1200s come in different flavors.
heres the lowdown

1200 (mkI):  original design, has no +/-8 slider, rather has a knob to
control 33 pitch and a knob for 45.  similar in look otherwise to a mkII.

1200 mkII:  more torque, pitch slider.

1200 mkII is now available in black and also the gold plated limited edition.

1200 mkIII's are now back in production and have gold plated connectors on
the cables and even more torque yet.

1210s are black versions of the 1200 mkII that are designed for european
mains, there is a switch inside for 110/220 volts, and were not to be sold
in the us, but are imported nonetheless.

if there are any other variations, i'd love to know, especially about the
1300 or is it 1400s with the digital controls?

headed down there this week-end I'd really appreciate a ride. I'm
willing to pay for gas, tolls, and all that good stuff. I'd prefer a
ride leaving aroung 3:30 - 5:30 ish on Friday and coming back Sunday
afternoon, but at this point I'd settle for anything. Please respond to

Well freak-e got busted after 3am, and the rumor-mill is saying i called
the police.  _THIS_RUMOR_IS_BULLSHIT_  i was at home installing win95 on a
laptop for a friend and playing records.  an announcement was made at
freak-e by some lackey of the promoter (cory) about not going to battered
armadillo parties because we called the police.  well this is slander and
defamation of character.  i just had to say my side of the story, not that
it matters alot at this point.  and missy, print out some copies for the
cru to laugh at or whatever if they can even read.

STING
Washington DC


On Friday, November 7, the Buzz Crew continues the Sting party series
with
Sting #12 featuring the V Classics Tour, two live acts, a star-studded dj
line-up, and a production far exceding any we've had before.

Sting 12 will have the most elaborate lighting and sound system ever 
assembled in the Ballroom.  Make sure you take advantage of this
exclusive 
opportunity to witness state-of-the-art technology in action.

Features:

*an entirely revamped sound system -- with inescapable, penetrating
BASS!

*more than THREE times the number of lights than normal.  Over 30 (yes, 
THIRTY) intellabeams, and a dozen cyberlights, and that's just for
starters.

*all the lights will be on a moveable truss system that will expand over
the 
entire room.  Computer-controlled, ascending/descending rigs propelled
at 
different angles will mean that you will be at the mercy of hi-tech visual 
wizardry.

This set-up is exclusive at the Ballroom for this ONE NIGHT ONLY!!!  Make

sure you can say you were there to experience it!

Speaking of Steel City - anyone know if they plan to get any of the UK
tours that have been through the US?  It seems like most of the tours are
over or ending, but there's always that possibility.  Not to slight the
local talent - I'd always go just the same.

Also - can someone post the line-up for next tues?

Strictly FYI my butt... ;) What Hossam's really trying to say is that
he'll be MCing for 1.8.7 and both of them are excited to be going down and
would like you to share in their joy.  It will be an impressive show,
y'know, The Monster Truck Superstar Rally of jungle you might say.  I'd
prolly give it a thumbs up...good beat and you can dance to it.  :P

Have fun and see you at Buzz...if i don't get thrown out for illegal
possession of Vivarin again...

Speaking of Steel City - anyone know if they plan to get any of the UK
tours that have been through the US?  It seems like most of the tours are
over or ending, but there's always that possibility.  Not to slight the
local talent - I'd always go just the same.

Also - can someone post the line-up for next tues?



lineup for the next steel city jungle (11/4) is dj overload from dc (formerly
boston, in a much-awaited return to pgh, and dj^2 (dj squared) (dj dj?)
splitting up the duties b/w the two of them all nite, andy/sine will be in
florida enjoying a well-deserved vacation :)

as far as getting a tour goes...it costs money. and usually it's A LOT of
money...in a space like laga, where u have the space, lights and sound
locked down, it's better than trying to throw a one-off with a tour on the
lineup...but a tour usually costs several thousand (be it the jungle sky,
breakbeat science, ToV, v records, etc...) dollars for performer's fees,
expenses (hotels, airfare, etc), not counting any particulars they may
have on their riders in their contracts (ie-specifying additional sound or
lights be brought into a club, using a specific audio/visual company for
the entire tour, paying for an 'entourage' like a dj's agent or
boy/girl/friend(s) to come along, etc...) 

and as we all know, pittsburgh doesn't have the economy to support
that. not only in terms of affording the cost of bringing a tour into town,
but once here, having the event do well enuff to not lose your shirt on
the event.  i won't even assume it'll do well enuff to make the effort pay
off or even justify doing another similar event. we're too small/apathetic.
this has been proven over the years. the occasional big house party will
go off, but this is one of the most peculiar cities to try and throw a party
in, you never can tell what will hit and what will miss like in other
cities...lord knows we've guessed enuff, and been wrong more than
right...

but GO TO STING! (thanks steph) i'd love to hear pittsburgh make some
noise that nite :) 


IF YOU ARE GOING TO STING, WANT TO GO TO STING, OR KNOW
SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO STING, WRITE ME
(hossam@topsecret.net)...i'd like to make sure everyone who wants a
ride has one....


peace,
hossam

Al Lerner . . . isn't that the guy truly behind Cleveland losing the
Browns?  Selling credit cards with pretty pictures on them at really high
interest rates.  A true contribution to society.

poor stevie...

i guess all these years of raving have driven him to jump.  
he seems to have fallen into that all-too-common mindset 
that 5% run 90% and THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT so 
might as well have some more The Real World and Rice Chex.

at least, stevie, your wish will come true...you will be 
remembered for years, long after you are gone...as another 
one of those "don't let this happen to you" examples.

again, poor stevie.  i have nothing but pity for someone 
who truly believes that they are trapped in or at whatever 
their present place in life happens to be...if that is the 
ghetto or suburb or penthouse.  you are only limited by how 
bad you want to change, by how much you are driven.
