Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm

http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

My Fellow Americans,

Things are hard. They require hard work, which makes them hard. But we have to do these hard things
with resolve. We can't send mixed messages about the hard things we have to do with resolve. Because
they're hard things to do. And they require resolve.

And don't forget Poland.

Thank you, and God bless America.

George W. Bush

Subject: {pb-cle} Headphones Question

Hey folks-

I was looking at getting a pair of Pioneer HDJ-1000 headphones. I was 
wondering if anybody here has any experience with the headphones and 
what you thought of them.

Thanks.

I bought the Sony MDR-V900 headphones and love them.

A little pricey, but they're great for live gigs and saved my ass from bad monitors on a couple occasions.

every bar code has 3 6's in it, beginning middle end. the 6 seperates the code into 2 sections. it happens to be the most flexible number for the scanning system. interpret that however you want.

I have those as well, and also have had mine for 5 years.  I like them a lot. 
They are still in good condition and are very comfortable.

Your lucky, I have either lost, broke or had stolen around 6 or 7
pairs.  I just recently went back to the good old mdr-v600, they have
never failed me (those are the ones that were stolen) plus they are
like 65 bux at the grovecity outlet mall.

After destroying every Sony headphone known to man 4-5 times and trying 
some other brands, I fell upon the Audio Technica ATH-M40fs model, got 
for like $60  on sale (normally $100+, but look around), and they're 
uber useful for a lot of things.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Headphones Question

i've been selling a lot of the sennheiser hd-25 headphones at the store
and i have a pair at home and the store for myself.  i can't imagine using
anything else.  aside from having a shorter cord, the sound is awesome and
they fit snug around your ear - the padded portion kind of curves to fit
to your ear and you can't hear *anything* outside the ear piece - it's
like being in a sound proof booth.  plus, one side has a swiveling ear
piece that keeps them in good shape longer because you don't have to
constantly twist them to leave an ear free when you're mixing.

i love these headphones.

i sell a decent amount of sony's too.  but they generally fall apart after
less than a year's use - especially the 700s.  the 600s are more durable
for some reason.  and they're not silver :)

i have had a pair of the sony 600s for 4 years now, and they 
function and look pretty much as if they were new. of course i 
dont beat up my equipment either. actually i think most of the 
people i know use those as well, im sure that shawn and jwan 
definitely do. those senheisers seemed too tight, it would get 
annoying. i like to play with my headphones hanging off my ears 
sometimes so i can hear the outside speaker and the headphones at 
the same time. if you need your headphones to be soundproof, 
theres this thing called the gain knob for your monitors. turn it 
down. deafness is not the bomb. the sony 700s are the worst 
headphones ever, they just fall off your head because of how they 
swivel. get sony 600s. cheap, reliable, etc.

Evidently I've stumbled onto an off-topic digest (despite the emails sent that says it's not and to keep off-topic posts to a minimum).  How do I go about un-subscribing? Do I have to go back to the original website (there's no convenient link at the bottom of any email).

What broke on them?  

A friend of mine, the wire the runs over the top band of the
headphones snapped and he replaced with with a thicker gauge wire and
hasn't had problems since.

Outside of that issue, I don't know anyone who has had any complaints.

Subject: {pb-cle} Speaker parts advice...

I happen to have a pair of 4' speaker boxes and I'm interested in putting some 
speaker parts into them.  The holes are already in the speaker box.  It looks 
like I'll need a 15" subwoofer, a 5" midspeaker & a tweeter.  I've been told 
that it's a real bitch building your own speakers, but I'm confident that with 
the right advice, I can build a good pair and save money.  I want to have as 
much power as I possibly can without catching my house on fire.  

Ebay looks like an attractive spot to get the subwoofers.  Is there anything 
that the people here in West Virginia have not told me that I'm going to need 
to hook the three speaker parts together?  (The people here can't tell their 
heads from their asses here.  They don't know anything.  Therefore, I cannot 
depend on these people for anything.)  Can anyone provide a link or something 
to some information to provide a little help in specifications to each speaker 
part so that I don't watch a few hundred bucks go up in smoke?  Any help is 
appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} current anti-terrorim report...

this guy's been banned from sfraves in San Francisco. he actually
slowed the entire list down because his posts were at least 50% of all
list activity. I think he also threatened my life, although I'm not
sure about that. I set up some pretty good e-mail filters and have
been free of his bullshit for a while, but a friend of mine told me
that this nutjob said he had sent gangsters from Las Vegas after me
with tommy guns or something.

this guy was an idiot and obviously a god damn poser.
i posted a party going on in vegas on there and he threatened me.
i explained to him that if you threaten a world leader you are put
on a terrorist watch list.  he didn't get it.  so the FBI and Homeland
Security got involved...he also threatened wal-mart, which
is like west coast world trade, he was a terrorist threat to world
trade and a world leader.

if he got cement shoes from some big guys from vegas and is at
the bottom of the bay in SF, it's not my fault.

atleast my deployment of agents kept those faggots from getting run
over.

Lucy Ballinger, Wales on Sunday


COPS are spreading muck to stop illegal raves in Wales.

Farmers in remote parts of the country are being advised by police to cover 
their fields with fresh manure to deter fashion-conscious ravers stepping 
foot on their land in designer trainers.

Pembrokeshire farmland in particular is a magnet for dance-til-dawn illegal 
parties, often fuelled by drink and drugs.

And officers believe the organic crime-buster is already bringing a sweet 
smell of success in West Wales.

"It's a way of deterring them turning up and camping in fields," said a 
force spokesman.

"Who'd want to have a party and camp in a field covered with fresh dung or 
slurry?"

The initiative has been used since April this year as one of a range of 
ideas to keep ravers away. It has proved successful in deterring party-goers 
this summer.

Last year there were a series of raves in Pembrokeshire. In August 2003, 20 
party organisers approached a farmer in Marloes and told him they were about 
to have a party on his field, and he was unable to stop them. More than 500 
people attended the illegal rave, which lasted four days.

They set up their own sound system and farmer Owen Morgan said he felt 
'powerless' because he would need a court order to move them on.

A similar situation happened at Whitesands, near St David's, provoking 
complaints from holidaymakers and locals.

This year Dyfed-Powys Police teamed up with Pembrokeshire Council, the 
National Park Authority, National Trust and other groups to try to avoid a 
repeat.

Police monitored potential sites and had a quick response team on standby at 
high-risk periods for signs of disturbance.

But farmers were told the most effective way to prevent raves was to act 
before they started, and landowners were being encouraged to report any 
warning signs.

Pc Max Bevan, a community safety officer in Pembrokeshire, said: "If farmers 
want to spread muck on their field then it is a pretty good deterrent, and 
we do have a ready supply of that material here!

"After the events last year we have proactively attempted to prevent events 
taking place."

Julian Salmon, Wales director of the Country Land and Business Association, 
said the slurry method was tried, tested and very successful.

"When people spread slurry on the fields it seems to calm the ravers down," 
said Mr Salmon.

"It makes the field less attractive!"

POLICE hope they'll cause a bit of a stink with their smelly solution to 
illegal raves.

But they may have to call in the fashion police instead. Their plan may be

I love this part.... just picture this for a second.



"In August 2003, 20
party organisers approached a farmer in Marloes and told him they were 
about
to have a party on his field, and he was unable to stop them. More than 500
people attended the illegal rave, which lasted four days."

our hotel is on strike and ben has the flu.  i've been buying clothes and
trying to get over saturday.  it was fun.  the floats weren't as
impressive as they should have been.  but lots of good music.  the sf d&b
float would get my 1st place prize for music, float & energy.

alan, i really did buy you a t-shirt.  i think someone used it to wipe up
float goo.  (sorry!)

there are a few of a naked senior citizen pics that really need to be
posted.  unfortunatly i forgot my digital camera.  we'll have to wait for
the 8x10 glossies on that.  until then - zemo & tamara, the type 0 guys,

Subject: 	[mw] What tracks influenced Derrick Carter the most?
Date: 	Mon, 4 Oct 2004 12:39:33 -0500



Tuesday, October 5th, Interrupt Media and Subsystence proudly present:

INFLUENCE.

Featuring unmixed DJ sets from:

DERRICK CARTER (Classic)
J-DUB (All World)
DAVE SISKA (Clinically Inclined)
KARL MEIER (Subsystence)

@ Sonotheque
1444 W Chicago Ave
Chicago, IL
9 pm - 2 am
21+ | $2 PBR
NO COVER

"Even with your all-consuming obsession with house music, the chance that
you'll wind up talking shop with Derrick Carter is paper thin. But no need
to worry - the culture mavens at web magazine Subsystence.net have come up
with the next best thing. Their monthly Influence night gathers some of the
city's most discriminating DJs and musicians for a night of unmixed sets
that spans genres, which provides the artists with an opportunity to drop
some personal favorites that might not move the average dance floor.
Tonight's lineup includes local house favorite J-Dub, techno stalwart Karl
Meier, and Dave Siska, the host of the Clinically Inclined radio show. And
the two-dollar PBRs don't hurt." - Patrick Sisson, Flavorpill Chicago

I've heard this a few times but couldn't get the name, anywhere here's 
a part of the lyrics that I remember:

'I'll never stop, (be)cause I need ya and I never want to let you go'

google didn't come up with anything, both the whole phrase and tried to 
doing parts of it.

Tuesday, October 5th, Interrupt Media and Subsystence proudly present:

INFLUENCE.

Featuring unmixed DJ sets from:

DERRICK CARTER (Classic)
J-DUB (All World)
DAVE SISKA (Clinically Inclined)
KARL MEIER (Subsystence)

@ Sonotheque
1444 W Chicago Ave
Chicago, IL
9 pm - 2 am
21+ | $2 PBR
NO COVER

"Even with your all-consuming obsession with house music, the chance that
you'll wind up talking shop with Derrick Carter is paper thin. But no need
to worry - the culture mavens at web magazine Subsystence.net have come up
with the next best thing. Their monthly Influence night gathers some of the
city's most discriminating DJs and musicians for a night of unmixed sets
that spans genres, which provides the artists with an opportunity to drop
some personal favorites that might not move the average dance floor.
Tonight's lineup includes local house favorite J-Dub, techno stalwart Karl
Meier, and Dave Siska, the host of the Clinically Inclined radio show. And
the two-dollar PBRs don't hurt." - Patrick Sisson, Flavorpill Chicago

Heh, well I don't know about that but I sure as fuck wouldn't be
disappointed if songs weren't mixed at a club if the DJ dropped Front 242
followed by Dead Can Dance followed by...you get the point.

tom, seriously, you need to get off your high horse for a second.

yes, there are good records that you can just listen to.

mixing is the medium where we differentiate between listening and
having some sort of transitional phase added.  whether it is to
facilitate dancing (because you can kill vibe if you're just playing
records with mismatched tempo level and/or breaks), or to just serve
as a smooth flowing composition that is easy on the senses.

if you're looking to just listen, sure, host a listening party.
if you're looking to inspire dance, mixing is a medium to achieve those ends. 
if you're looking to take a listener on a journey, there still needs
to be some segue such as mixing, or a voice over, or something.  a
device is needed.

you need to come up with more concrete one liners than 'mixing is for
people who dont have good enough records to let stand on their own.' 
or at least back it up with supporting information / statistics.

polling one person named Tom Cox isnt enough to come to the conclusion
that a statement is an absolute.

it depends. if a deejay is playing good music, i can be very
forgiving of bad mixes. if hes playing nonsense, im just going to
go to town on all aspects of his performance.

ask david mancuso what he thinks about that. or any of the
soundsystem selectors who didnt mix. or really anyone who invented
dance music being played by disc jockeys. mixing for the most part
was a  way to make sets of same tempo same feel more palatable.
which is wack anyway. if youre not mixing up tempos and sounds,
you cant really deejay.

actually it is. good records stand for themselves. wack
progressive tunes with 64 bar intros that dont interfere with the
other tune already playing dont stand for shit. try listening to a
set of any contemporary rave music without mixing it and youll
wanna cry. try doing the same with good music, and you wont even
care. 


the more that i deejay when its pretty much impossible to mix, the
more i like it. and the more i find it much more effective in
getting dancing going. if youre going to be playing a couple
similar tunes in a row, go ahead and mix them. if not, dont. thats
whats up.

why do i suspect alans going to have something witty to say?

anyhow, we've got probably 8-10 people going up to toronto for "be 
excellent to each other"....  its unfortunate that we have to drive 6 
hours for this sort of thing.  of course you're driving 7+ hours for 
"whistle".

anyhow todds going up there too.... i can't fucking wait for toronto.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Happy hardcore track id

last time I heard it was on di.fm's hardcore channel.  I've heard it a 
few times at parties, not sure if I've heard it on a mix cd.  It's all 
been fairly recent though, like within the last year or so

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Coffee IS good for you

Originally just wanted to post to the ot list, but figure the caffeine 
part would be close enough to a somewhat related topic here (although 
does this count as talking about drug use?)

Since I've been at the new job I've been drinking more coffee, even 
though I don't really care for it, but it has caffeine and it's free :) 
  So did a quick google on the subject:

http://my.webmd.com/content/Article/80/96454.htm

and even more interesting is the second page that mentions all the 
benefits of caffeine.

I am VR, and I approve of this message.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Coffee IS good for you

note how I said it's free :)  we have a huge canister of folgers in the 
freezer and I figured out how to work the coffee pot :)

Only downside to this is the yellowing teeth since I already have this 
yellowish hue towards the base of my teeth, but the other 80% of it is 
white, and I use colgate total which has abrasives in it that 
"naturally whiten" your teeth.  oh well, I don't smile much anyway.

And as far as the caffeine, I got bag of pure caffeine I can add in if 
it need be :)  And the addictiveness is attributed to the caffeine.  
Same reason why people get hooked on pop is the caffeine.  that's 
supposedly why canada is so restrictive on caffeine.  That reminds me, 
we need to get some cases of mt dew to bring up there ;)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Coffee IS good for you

Coffee is ok, but I normally just go for the 80 pack of CVS brand
no-dosez'(straight 200 mgs of our friend caffy (2 cups of coffee)). No its
not free, but the $8 is not bad for not ever having to taste that nasty
shit.

Diluted with suga n cream or not.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Coffee IS good for you

Just like most stuff you can't stand, after drinking it for a couple 
weeks the taste doesn't bother me....  Working on see what I can keep 
out.  Tried it with just creamer unsuccessfully, now I'm trying just 
sugar and it's a lot better than the just creamer :)

hmm... or crush up a no doz and put that in with the coffee :)

So what's going on this year?

I wouldn't mind coming back home for something if anybody's having a house
party or anything. Last year was completely off the axle if you know what
I'm talking about and I was totally fucking retarded. That's what I like.
Fuck a rave.

here's what's going on NOW here in pittsburgh regarding electro
and synthpop. 
not 'retro' but rather, current artists doing amazing music, live!

Wed October 13
SOLVENT  
synthpop-electro king from Toronto. started on his own label Suction
Records. Released an LP 3 years ago on Morr Music (German-based label
for artists such as Lali Puna, Ms Jones Soda and Mum). Released an EP
on Ersatz Audio (home of Adult and Tamion 12 Inch). Now he has a new
CD "Apples and Synthesizers", on Ghostly International (named one of
the year's hot labels by Rolling Stone!). Do you like the pure synthpop
sound of the first two Depeche mode albums? This will move you.

with US IDM artist LUSINE (also on Ghostly, downtempo stuff compared
to Boards of Canada)
plus Eko Farm and Syne Lapse Variate
8 pm  $10  all ages  Garfield Artworks, 4931 Penn Ave  
mention the goth list and get $3 off admission!

and....

Fri October 15
CHROMEO
amazing electro-funk duo from Brooklyn, new CD "She's In Control" on
Vice Records. It sounds like the vocoder funk disco of the 80s - remember
Rockwell and Laura Branigan, Sparks and EBN OZN? But it's brand new,
created by an Arab and a Jew. Some of the sexiest dance stuff you'll hear

After a second read of the original post, I can see that it might be 
confusing in a diagram-the-sentence-sort-of-way.  Cozmic Spore is the

He spammed me one last time to tell me he shut down the site. Good

Now now, be fair:

"Earlier Friday, FOXNews.com posted an item purporting to contain quotations 
from Kerry. The item was based on a reporters partial script that had been 
written in jest and should not have been posted or broadcast. We regret the 
error, which occurred because of fatigue and bad judgment, not malice."

Boing Boing: "Fox News ran a story with made-up quotes from Kerry, then 
yanked them without explanation"

Whatever side you may take, I mean, thats just not true.

They were wrong, there was an explanation... on the Fox news Website. Thats 
all I was trying to saying. At least they admit they were wrong on that 
topic, geeze oh man.... the hammer of justice is upon me!

Well, that was posted before they ran the retraction days later. 
Either way this is old news no?  But www.talkingpointsmemo.com is a
good site (the site referred to by boing boing).

FOX news needs to admit they are wrong about so much more ...

If you feel the same way I do about Rupert Murdock, Bill O' Reilly, or 
anyone else in the FOX news network, please visit the below website and 
contribute your opinion or at the very least, your signature to a worthy 
cause.

If you are not aware of the FOX news clan, watch it for about a day or two 
(or even just the 30 second clip on the website) and see how your 
blood-pressure rises; but your awareness, intellect and tolerance for 
mankind do not.

Common Cause, MoveOn.org and a bunch of other organizations have launched a 
campaign to take on Fox for pretending their partisan news is "fair and 
balanced." They've posted a really horrifying but funny video clip 
highlighting Bill O'Reilly's hypocrisy as well as a complaint to the FTC at:

http://www.moveon.org/fox

Check it out.

The challenges to Fox's partisanship are mounting. It's crucial that we 
voice our disgust with Fox's deceptive advertising now.

Non Related Topic ... but my 2 cents anyway.

Jason C.

A good site that is setup to basically address the wrongs, biases and
flat out lies that occur on Fox News, are said by Rush Limbaugh, etc,
is:

www.mediamatters.org

Backs everything up with facts.

A good site that is setup to basically address the wrongs, biases and
flat out lies that occur on Fox News, are said by Rush Limbaugh, etc,
is:

www.mediamatters.org

Backs everything up with facts.

Ann is beautiful, AND she's Conservative.

Amazing woman.

Why am I not surprised...

<<Ann is beautiful, AND she's Conservative.>>

Umm...I'll concede the conservative point:
LINDA VESTER (host): You say you'd rather not talk to liberals at all?
COULTER: I think a baseball bat is the most effective way these days.
[FOX News Channel, DaySide with Linda Vester, 10/6]

And while I wouldn't call her "Dick Cheney in a skirt", man...she's hardly "beautiful". I can
understand why you and your Conservative ilk would think this, though...See, the problem is, every
other conservative female looks like Barbara Bush (ol' blue hair) or Condoleeza "I'm so geeky I make
Lisa Simpson look like a supermodel" Rice....Coulter is the only one with a passing hint of
femininity.

Every time I see Ol' Man Hands on tv, I can't help the expectation that at any moment she's going to
unsheath her wings and fly off like the pterodactyl she is....perhaps biting the head off whatever
"liberal media" talk show host may be seated across from her on the way out....

You shoulda been here during the DNC.  The ONLY attractive females  
anywhere were the College Republicans.


We have the hot guys too:  Dubya, Hannity, Reagan, etc.


You guys have, um...Herman Munster?

dude WHATEVER.  if you need inspiration for wanting to just beat that
woman senseless, read al franken's book - "lies, and the lying liars who
tell them."

chapter 2 is entitled "Ann Coulter: nutcase".  and he makes a good case
for it.

franken is ugly.  he *drills* people who abuse the english language (which
is one of my biggest reasons for hating anyone i hate) AND he's funny to
boot.

if you're going to be catty about it, the woman is too old to wear her
hair the way she does and it's dry and in need of a good cutting and oil
treatment everytime i see her on tv.

Subject: {pb-cle} Reminder - Jay Tripwire at Wish Sat.

I'm pretty sure this has been posted to the list
before, but the following is a friendly reminder:

Sat, Oct. 9 Plate Tectonics and Wish Nightclub present

JAY TRIPWIRE, A.K.A. MR. BARCODE
(Northern Lights, Gourmet / Los Angeles)

Travis Owens (C'bus)

Jamie Tyler and Damon Havill (Plate Tectonics)

21+
No Dress Code
FREE BEFORE 11, $5 after

Wish Nightclub
621 Johnson Court (off of west sixth)
Cleveland

I'm really looking forward to this one as I have more
of Jay's records in my bag than any other single
producer...this is not to be missed by anyone who digs
funked-up, chunky tech house.  

Also, if anyone's interested in taking some chill (for
the most part) tech house home with them I will have a
few CD's on hand to give away...just ask:)

-Jamie

>Where can I get ahold of that movie / video that I believe Jason mentioned 
>that really eviscerates Fox?

you definitely can find it on Netflix and maybe Blockbuster but it's 
actually playing at the Regent Square theater soon.

Opens Oct. 15:
Outfoxed: Robert Murdochs War on Journalism
An obsessively researched expose.  NY Times Magazine
In the American media, the job of exposing bias is often taken
up by those with a definite point of view. Fox News came into
being with the intention of balancing the supposed leftward
tilt of the print and broadcast mainstream. Robert Greenwald,
director of Outfoxed, also has a definite point of view: that
Fox News is anything but fair and balanced. Includes many
compelling interviews, including Nation columnist Eric Alterman,
Al Franken and other leftist pundits, as well as more politically
centrist observers like Walter Cronkite. Former members of Fox
News, both local & national, speak candidly about the regular
in-house edicts telling them how to politically portray their news
broadcasts. Bill OReilly, host of Foxs top-rated show, comes off
especially poorly during an interview with the son a 9/11 victim
who protested the war in Iraq. (Directed by Robert Greenwald;
USA; 2004; 78 min.) The film will be followed by talks on:
Mon, Oct 18  Bill Steigerwald, assoc. editor of the Tribune-Review.
Tue, Oct 19  a spokeperson for the Kerry/Edwards campaign.
Wed, Oct 20  David Shribman, exec. editor of the Post-Gazette.

other films that are a must see before the election ...

'Uncovered: the War on Iraq'
This controversial film takes you behind the walls of government,
as CIA, Pentagon and foreign service experts speak
out  many for the first time  detailing the misstatements and
exaggerations that served as the reasons to fight a preemptive
war on Iraq. Without berating the viewer, an in-depth look at the
unsettling distortion of intelligence and spin presented to the
American people, the Congress and the press. Fighting wars
to bring about regime change is in breach of international law.
Among those interviewed are former Ambassador Joe Wilson,
weapons inspectors Scott Ritter and David Albright, anti-terrorism
expert Rand Beers, former CIA analyst Ray McGovern,
former CIA operative Robert Baer and Washington editor of The
Nation, David Corn. Some of these people supported the war
itself but are deeply concerned about the way information was
misused. All believe it is their duty to speak up. A riveting film.
(Directed by Robert Greenwald; USA; 2004; 83 min.)


'Farenheit 9/11'
you all should know about this one by now.

Yeah, I'm really looking forward to this Saturday! This is a rare treat to get to see Jay Tripwire in Cleveland and for FREE! I know a lot of people heading this way for the show, I hope some of the PB-Cle folks will be able to make the trek. This is going to be one show not to miss, see everyone on the dance floor!!

I'm really looking forward to this one as I have more
of Jay's records in my bag than any other single
producer...this is not to be missed by anyone who digs
funked-up, chunky tech house. 

Also, if anyone's interested in taking some chill (for
the most part) tech house home with them I will have a
few CD's on hand to give away...just ask:)

i can only remember that tune using that sample, it was semi
popular at the time amongst people who knew what the fuck was up.
it made the top 3 in my list of top 25 post 97 drum and bass
records. sine played it at the burial, which was released on a
bulletproof mixtape "Sine: Dead @ the Burial". it even got a
rewind so you get to hear alot of it, if you can find that mix.
great set, actually. 

you guys are like only 6 years late on this one ;P

well then someone is REALLY late in biting one of the best DnB
tracks ever made. too bad, theyd never have a chance of topping
the original. its like that recent record on Mu-ziq that sampled
"the snowman". itll never be x-project's "dubplate", and they were
only about 10 years late on that bite.

http://www.drudgereport.com/fox.htm

Granted this is from Drudge  - it seems like a rather open and shut
case, in favor of O'Reilly - whether you like him or not.

quoted from another board:
"A Summary: Associate Producer worked on The Factor for 4 years.
Demanded a raise, got it. Jumped ship for CNN, where her boss was
fired for sexual harassment. She returned to The Factor, quit and
without warning alleged sexual harrasment and demanded a payment of
$60 million to keep the 'incident' quite. The most she alleges is that
'inappropriate verbal comments' were made; no advances, pressure, or
forced encounters. In fact, she admits those things did NOT happen."

>From Drudge (see link)
"The claimed damages are also inexplicable given that: (a) Mackris
does not allege that O'Reilly ever touched her in any way, much less
assaulted her, (b) she does not allege that she suffered any adverse
employment action such as a demotion or loss of pay or even threatened
with an adverse action, and (c) she does not allege that she
complained to Fox's Human Resources Department about harassment,
notwithstanding that Fox and News Corp maintain written harassment
prevention policies and complaint procedures. In fact, Mackris did not
complain prior to the delivery of the letter, and Mackris acknowledged
during the meetings with Morelli and the News Corp and Fox
representatives that O'Reilly never touched her in an inappropriate
manner."

Sounds frivolous and fraudulent.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

SHORTKUT in Pgh, Oct.15, ages 18+

Fri. October 15 @ The Eye - ages 18 , 7pm

DigitalGoodtime.com, Brighton Music Center and Shure proudly present:

SHORTKUT of the World Famous Beat Junkies![/color]

That's right y'all, SHORTKUT is coming to Pittsburgh. Shortkut will be 
performing a FREE 20 minute demo at Brighton Music Center on Babcock 
Boulevard, showing aspiring turntablists scratch techniques and possibly 
also demo-ing the Rane Serato Scratch machine, Rane's answer to 
Stanton's Final Scratch. This will be followed by autographs, giveaways 
and raffles (featuring the needles described later). Then in the 
evening, SHORTKUT will be performing a full-length set at THE EYE on 
Penn Avenue and the raffle winners will be announced. Only those 
attending Brighton's demo will be given raffle tickets for the needles, 
but all get the free goodies. Winners of the raffle will be announced @ 
The Eye later that night, and only those at The Eye are eligible to win. 
In short, you gotta be at both performances to win these needles, but 
they're well well worth it...

Giveaways at Brighton from Shure will include a raffle for a pair of 
M447 scratch needles (the industry benchmark and praised for their 
quality; endorsed by the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Beat Junkies, 
X-Ecutioners, DJ Craze and more), t-shirts, stickers and more. In 
addition, we have swag from Odyssey, Rane, Brighton Music Center, 
Digital Goodtime, LLC and more...

More info to be posted as it becomes confirmed, so check back!

Day Venue: Brighton Music Center, 2110 Babcock Blvd.
Night Venue: The Eye, 4814 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA

http://www.digitalgoodtime.com/flyers/2004/shortkutwebback.jpg

from Beatjunkies.com:

Shortkut began his DJ career is 1987 with Just 2 Hype!, a DJ crew based 
out of Daly City, California. In 1994, Shortkut, together with QBert and 
MixMaster Mike, formed the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, a legendary turntable 
band that heralded a new era in the DJ/turntablist world, and helped 
raise this musical art to its new form. Later that same year, J.Rocc, 
the "Funky President" of the Beat Junkies, invited Shortkut to join 
their internationally acclaimed collective, based out of Los Angeles. 
Shortkut's addition to this musical group has diversified the Beat 
Junkie audience to new realms....

Sat Oct 30                      FUCK THE VOTE                    Pittsburgh

[still on, but POH pulled out, i'm sure theres a party in my pants joke 
to be dropped here]

Pursuit of Happiness has CANCELLED our participation in Fuck the Vote on 
October 30, 2004.

Our events often involve cooperation between members of our own core 
group and others. When differences of opinion exist, we try to 
compromise as much as possible to ensure that everyone is satisfied with 
what we would accomplish. In this case, we came to a simple 
determination that the necessary compromises would fail to accomplish 
our goals, and so we have withdrawn.

Note that there are no hard feelings on our part, and the hard work that 
went into making this event take place is something we respect and we 
will give full support if and when we may be asked to do so. The name of 
the party may change, the line-up we had been prepared to announce may 
change, even the date and venue we intended to use may change, any and 
all details are no longer our decisions to make. It is not our party 
now, it will not be a PoH event.

I am sorry to all of those who were looking forward to this.

Evolution and Breakline Crew Present... ELEMENTS OF LIFE

FREE GIVEAWAYS BY UFO Clothing!!

Friday, December 10th 2004
Cleveland, Ohio

**IN THIER FIRST EVER PREFORMANCE TOGETHER***
-XAVIER, KOS, AND MC FLIPSIDE (House, Hard House, Live PA)
Xavier and Kos are artists that are one of a kind. When the table is set 
and the crowd is in full force, they drop the high-energy funk that 
crushes dances floors and makes the walls shake. Now with the addition 
of MC Flipsides the party is sure to be hyped!

-Kaos - (Philly - Human Imprint, Habit, Violence, Atlas, Circle, 
Breakline Crew) DnB
Fresh off tour with Dieselboy and a nationally publicized tour sponsored 
by SALEM, Kaos has maintained his status as one of the key figures of 
the Human Imprint label as well as having releases out or slated on 
Violence, Atlas, Renegade Hardware, Habit and Circle, as well as 
remixing tunes for drum and bass greats such as Bad Company. Recently 
featured on the cover of the d'n'b publication Rinse Magazine, Kaos is 
still holding tight as production partner to Dieselboy.

-Annalyze (Rochester, NY - Stanton, Breakline Crew) Breakbeat turntablist
NY's own DJ Annalyze has played all over the US & Canada alongside DJ's 
Baby Anne, Shortee, Q-bert, Rap, Aphrodite, Jackal, Danny the Wildchild 
& much more . She has made appearance at the Winter NAMM show in 2003 & 
2004 and also did spot dates for The VANS Warp Tour in 2002 & 2003. 
Earning a sponsorship by Stanton Magnetics, Anna & her scratch partner 
DJ Shortee form Stantons first female scratch duo "Twice as Nice. 
Anna combines breakbeat and electro with DMC style trickery & is known 
for rocking the crowd!.

-DJ Booth (Louisville, KY  Urban Loops, UFO Jeans, 4-Score) House
Fists in the air: Chaos reigns. For 8 years DJ Booth has dominated the 
midwest, headlining with international acts and struggling for what he 
now holds so dear  an extensive play history of dates nationally and 
internationally, an insurmountable fan base, multiple original 
compositions released nationwide, six mixed CD's, an appointment as a 
promotional rep by the UFO clothing company, and a rockin' remix of "Up 
to You" by Robbie Hardkiss of the famous Hardkiss brothers.

-Rob Riddum (Cleveland  J&N Media) Dnb/Hip-Hop turntablist
One of the key figures of the Element Squad returns to Cleveland. While 
in LA, Rob was working out of the old Beastie Boys studio Grand 
Royale where his main project was www.bradleyhiphop.com. Rob recently 
took home 3rd place at the Salt Lake City DMC. Come see this old skool 
turntablist wreck the decks.

-Kryteria (Curtis R & Patrick Felony  Miami  Breakline Crew) DnB
Playing prestigious events like Ultra Music Festival, Global Gathering, 
and Magical Maydaze has many djs and producers stateside and worldwide 
supporting this dynamic duo by playing their tunes and crowds all over 
are eating them up! With the likes of Karl K and Kaos behind these 
original bad boys none can contest!

-Ewun & Code-D (Rochester, NY  Evol Intent Recordings, Rocdnb, 
Skyehigh, Breakline Crew, La Selva) DnB/Dancehall/Turntablism
Ewun and Code-D are two of NYs most versatile dj's. Known for creative 
mixes and impressive scratch abilities, these two have grown to become 
professionals behind the decks. Code-D has mastered the ability to 
switch styles with ease and his scratching skills are sharp. Ewun has 
just been signed to Evol Intent Recordings, with other releases in the 
works on some of the industries top labels. With DJ support from Evol 
Intent, Tech Itch, Dylan, B-Key, just to name a few, expect to hear a 
lot of noise from this rising artist.

-The Lady Foursquare - (Louisville, KY - UFO Jeans) House
Name another woman who can hold it down right beside Paul Johnson after 
DEMF 2002, tag with Trevor Lamont (Teamsters), share a residency with 
DJs Kit Chaps of VHS or Beta (Astralwerks) and rock the main stage next 
to Terry Mullan, Diego Ro-k and Dieselboy: Foursquare is supporting UFO 
Jeans and her CD, "What Happened?" this fall.

-Jon Doe ( Skratch Fienz / Cleveland) DNB, Hip Hop, Turntablism
Jon Doe is one of the most talented DJ's in Cleveland and yet unknown to 
those outside Cleveland. Jon Doe has been spinning for over 10 years now 
and continues to progress every day. Jon Doe works seven days a week, 
almost twelve hours a day, but he always finds time to get out and play, 
doing what he loves most, blowing ur mind. Talented in so many different 
areas of music Jon Doe is sure to impress!

-Robtronix and MC Barrenzemo (Koala Tea / P3 - DNB & MC) Cleveland
His funky flavor will captivate you within the first second of hearing 
him. Don't let him fool ya by the "i'm a nice boy" smile, like anyone of 
us we have a bad side and he puts that into his music. His thoughts are 
the drums and bass, his voice is the scratch.

-Shagge (Breaks) Cleveland
Shagge is one of the most amazing Breaks DJ's u will ever see...No more 
needs to be said!

-DJ Moose (Break Beat Militia / Breaks, Jump Up Jungle) Cleveland
Moose's unique style sprouts from his hip-hop influence. Blending 
hip-hop with breaks and jungle as well as keeping the crowd entertained 
has been moose's goal and motivation from the start. "All I want to do 
is make the whole crowd bounce, yall!", a sample of Snoop Doggy Dogg in 
a J-Smooth track, is what Moose uses as a slogan for every performance.

Subject: {pb-cle} Bill "O-Oh" Reilly... + DJ Mix available online

I can see Bill making a bunch of rude remarks to that woman because that's the 
type of guy he appears to be.  He cracks me up on his shows, though.  He 
disses and trashes everyone.  I can see all the comedieans now... he he...

I decided to record a DJ mix this week and put it on my website: 
<http://www.coachroebuck.com/mixes/promomixoctober2004.mp3>.  I figured it was 
time to replace the "trainwreck" aka "the beginner's mix" I recorded 6 months 
ago.  I've been getting a lot more clicks on my website lately, so it probably 
is a good idea to get a more clean mix online and represent a little better, 
you know.

The mix is about 80 minutes in length.  This is the first positive step in a 
month.  Before that, I was experiencing mad equipment failures from mysterious 
noises from my turntables to speakers blowing up, sloppy-as-Hell recordings, 
graduate school kicking my ass, killing small-town high school parties because 
children don't understand house music & EDM, etc..  

If that link's messed up or something, just go to 
www.coachroebuck.com/releases.aspx and click away.  I'm currently looking to 
redesign my website.  I'm not much of an artistic person, though--I'm only a 
programmer.  Keep it real peoples!!  Peace out!!

because Hawaii receives federal funding - Federal Aid Highway Act

376 & 279 are considered "Interstates"

But also in Hawaii, they're designated with "H" instead of "I"

And speaking of hatred...Just in time for Christmas:

The RNC presents - Compassionate Conservative Babies!

When you squeeze Dick Cheney's tummy, he utters one of 3 great sayings:

"I never suggested a connection between 9/11 and Iraq"
"If you vote for the wrong candidate, this nation will go up in a mushroom cloud. BOOM,
Motherfucker!"

And his most compassionate, loving statement of the last four years:

"Go Fuck Yourself..."

Your guess is as good as mine.  I can only imagine that you could run a 
marathon across one of their interstates.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Just a thought...

" The Coast Guard O m e g a [stupid filters] Station (OMSTA) presented 
a unique challenge. The station, located on the windward side near the 
mouth of the Trans-Koolau Tunnels, is part of an eight-station, 
worldwide network which allows any aircraft or ship to determine its 
location to within a mile. OMSTA causes large insulated objects near 
the station to become energized, providing a small shock to anyone 
coming in contact with these items. HDOT was concerned that "surprise 
shocks" to workers on H-3 might result in a fall or other accident. In 
some cases, workers in sensitive areas were required to wear gloves or 
rubber boots. To prevent any effect on H-3 travelers, a device known as 
a Faraday Shield was installed over a short section of the highway near 
the mouth of the tunnels to reduce the electric field. The shield 
consists of six three-eighth-inch-diameter wires on each side of the 
road spaced one vertical meter apart and eight 
three-eighth-inch-diameter wires overhead. A wire mesh is incorporated 
into the pavement below to complete the shield."

that's cool, wonder how reliable computers are there :)

That particular passage that gave you such pause really isn't that bad. 
Any violence mentioned is potentially inflicted on the singer.  The only
negative thing said about your boys is that it's curtains for them,
meaning it would be totally keen if they were fired come November 2.  You
dig?  I mean, if you want to hear some hatred spewed, let me know, and we

No, it wasn't that bad, but what the hell does it have to do with  
promoting a rave night?  It's unneccesary hatred, for no reason whatsoever.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tonite : ODE TO GEORGE

<<Exactly my point.  No explanation, just attack...>>

Wow, the delusion is really showing now, Ian...how many times exactly did John Kerry call George
Bush a "conservative" like it was a bad word last night?

Every time George Bush says the word "liberal", his face gets this look like he's tasting a bite
full of shit with lemon sauce on it. That's learned behavior, folks.

When exactly did "Liberal" become a four letter word in this country?

My guess is right around the time a "liberal" got a "blow job" and your so-called "lovey-dovey,
sweetness-and-light conservatives" in this country tried to have him prosecuted for it.

******************
Liberal -
a: Not limited to or by established, traditional, orthodox, or authoritarian attitudes, views, or
dogmas; free from bigotry.

b: Favoring proposals for reform, open to new ideas for progress, and tolerant of the ideas and
behavior of others; broad-minded.
******************

I have to ask...Who DOESN'T want to be "free from bigotry"? Who DOESN'T claim to be "open to new
ideas for progress"?

Are you really happy with the way things are? Are you happy with an statistically perfectly divided
nation -- Half saying "things are going in the right direction", the other half saying the exact
opposite?

What happened to the promise George W. Bush made to be a uniter, not a divider? I'd say the country
is more divided now than it was four years ago. And that, to me, isn't living up to a promise.

yeah, but those interstates still connect to interstates that go to
different states.  same with 270 in columbus, 271 in cleveland, 480 in
cleveland... they still arent highways that go interstate, but they
connect to highways that do (and usually provide as alternate routes,
especially for haz mat)

Well, you talk about your politics on a rave list and they don't really
have anything to do with raves, do they?  Your sig file, which is present
in every post that you make to this list, has little to do with raves. 
And I don't see how it's explicit hatred to express dissatisfaction with
an administration and if they want to have a rave night dedicated to that,
who cares?  Rave themes truly do run the gamut, don't they?

> I'd like these supposed "hatred policies" you speak of.

Gay marriage bans
Stem-cell research bans
Partial-birth abortion bans (perhaps an empty victory but does not leave
any room for medically necessary procedures), to name a few.  They are
based on hatred and intolerance toward groups of people that aren't white,
heterosexual, healthy men.
If you're going to try to get into a little showdown about who knows Bush
better, I'll concede.  I'm sure that you know more.  But don't try to tell
me that the Right isn't pepped up on hate.  Please do not.

I didn't really listen to anything he said.  He spins everything so much

Since at least 1930 or so (when the US Socialist Party broke up and joined  
the Democrats, and FDR expanded government to a size unprecedented in a  
free nation), and it got another "boost" in the late 1960's.

That isn't what it means and you know it.

"Liberal" means:

1) More and more government control of every aspect of your life.

2) Compromising national security and not standing up to our enemies.

3) Intolerance and hatred of any other viewpoint besides #1 and #2.

I'm sure people like Michael Moore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, George  
Soros, and the mainstream/liberal media have NOTHING to do with that,  
right?

Yeah, I saw the last half of the debates, which were slightly amusing, 
but then at the end the guys were like "The 'L' word was mentioned a 
few times."  damn.  Media sucks.  At least the guy that compared the 
facts to fiction attacked both sides equally.

This thread, my friends, is why this list is dead.  There's an OT list 
for crap like this (blatent plug: 
http://pb-cle-ot.lists.vrillusions.com/) Although I'm sure if everyone 
really took everything OT to the OT list that there would maybe be 4 
posts a week here.  What happened when there were 200 messages a DAY 
that talked about PARTIES every day, not just weekends.  Doesn't matter 
it's election season or not.  It says right in the rules that this is 
place to talk about parties and stuff or something like that.

ugg, I want to go back to Toronto.

Of course they do.  The RAVE Act was written and sponsored by a DEMOCRAT.   
Why should ravers support the party and mindset that supports the RAVE Act?

I don't agree with Bush's support of a constitutional amendment to define  
marriage, but I do support him bringing it up so states can decide which  
is best for them in that issue, which is what is happening right now.


> Stem-cell research bans


There are no "stem-cell research bans".  The private sector has NO laws  
against stem-cell research; all that Bush did was stop the amount of  
TAXPAYER money to fund *baby* stem-cell research (adult stem-cell research  
is still highly funded by the government, and justifiablly so.  He is the  
first president to even ACKNOWLEDGE stem-cell research and set any kind of  
limits on federal spending of it.

So jamming scissors in the back of a baby's head and sucking it's brains  
out is a sign of "love"?  You seriously believe that?  That's sickening.


You have to remember that both these issues that you mentioned were not  
only correctly signed by the President, but also passed in Congress by an  
overwhelming BIPARTISAN majority.

Sure they are.  lol

<<I didn't really listen to anything he said.>>

Wow. Imagine that. A conservative who wasn't listening to anyone with a differing point of view....

Who'da thunk it?

<<That isn't what it means and you know it.>>

Talk to Mirriam-Webster...Which is precisely where I copied/pasted that definition from...

<<"Liberal" means:
1) More and more government control of every aspect of your life.>>

You mean like the Patriot Act?

- Or - the attempts to ban abortion by people who also claim to want fewer humans supported by
government welfare?

- Or - the ban on stem-cell research that prevents the hope of a cure to thousands who can scarcely
afford the fantastically affordable health care in this country?

<<2) Compromising national security and not standing up to our enemies.>>

You mean as opposed to compromising national security by overcommitting our military in the invasion
a country that DIDN'T attack our country, under the false pretenses of weapons of mass destruction,
AND after repeatedly lying about a link between the invaded country and the people who actually DID
attack our country?

-OR- by overcommitting monetary and military resources to an ill-concieved war (see above) while
only 2% of the containers shipped into this country by sea are screened for potential contraband
and/or weapons?

-OR- by overcommitting monetary blah blah blah...while THOUSANDS of miles of open coastlines and
land borders go unpatroled daily?

<<I'm sure people like Michael Moore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and the

OK. Now you're simply dropping cliche arguments...and you didn't answer the question posed...you
just changed the subject. Good job, Mr. Rove, Jr.

The fact is the aforemteioned people have called to light that that the only promise George W. Bush
has kept since taking office has been to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, and  provided an
in-road to greater profits for the big business owners he calls his "base".

<<Keep drinking your kool-aid...>>

I can't find the cup through all the crack-smoke coming from your general direction.

Ann Coulter lives a life of hatred too, and don't you love her?

If I were getting an abortion, I'd much rather have the fetus' head
stabbed as it pops out of my cervix than - oops! - have the "scissors" jam
a nice big hole in my uterus so that I can bleed to death, especially if
the reason for my abortion was my life already being in danger. In third
trimester abortions, the "partial-birth" procedure is MUCH safer for the
pregnant woman.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tonite : ODE TO GEORGE

First of all, no one cared that Clinton got a BJ --
I'm sure he got many.  The problem was that he did it
with an intern.   This is a no-no in our present
society.   Having "relations" with a subordinate
employee is careless and risky.   But who cares, that
is very old and our society is too uptight about these
things.   Now about the homophobic Kerry and Edwards. 
 What is wrong with them bringing up Dick Cheney's
daughter implying that she is a problem.   Dick Cheney
doesn't have a problem with her and yet both John
Edwards and John Kerry had felt compelled to mention
that Dick Cheney had a lesbian daughter in their
debates.  Why?   What's wrong with them????

By the way, what is Kerry's position on anything?   He
voted for the Iraq war but is now against and for
it???   Oh yea, that's right, Bush tricked him.
Of course, that makes a lot of sense.   That is right.
 Kerry has "plans".

"Double our special forces", sure, people are
enlisting like crazy right now.   Does Kerry intend to
start a draft???   (I also thought it took years to
train these people, when exactly does he expect to
complete the mission???)

"Raise the minimum wage"   Oh that's brilliant.  First
of all, who spends more than a year or two in minimum
wage jobs?    $7 is going to make us all rich now and
we can all buy a house.  But now my damn Chalupa is
going to cost $3.50.

Vote Nader (if your state will allow it).

It doesn't matter how you kill a baby, it's the fact that you are willing

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tonite : ODE TO GEORGE

there is nothing convienent about a 3rd trimester abortion...people that do
it are doing it because the face a serious health issue if the birth was to
go to full term...who's life is more important...a woman that has been alive
for however many years, or an unborn child?  women that have abortions
because they dont want the baby usually have it done at the earliest
possible moment it can be safely done...they dont wait until the third
trimester to do it.

the fact of the matter is in this country abortion is legal...and until it
is(if ever)made illegal it is a non-issue that right-wingers cling to to
hold their christian base...just like gay marriage, keeping god in the
pledge of alligence, or scaring the be-jesus out of everyone with ambigious
threats of terror...i think conservatives in this country would be much
better served by their parties if they'd stick to issues that have
relivance...like education, energy, and the economy...instead of switching
every issue to war, terrorism, abortion, or gay marrige.

get your facts straight, and quit spitting back the GOP's talking points.

I didn't get the impression that they find anything wrong with Cheney's
daughter being a lesbian. Cheney's against a constitutional amendment
prohibiting gays from marrying and so are Kerry and Edwards. The fact that
Bush is FOR the amendment actually conflicts with Cheney's views.

Kerry supported an Iraq war when the intelligence presented to the Senate
said that Saddam had WMD's, and provided we had the same coalition we had
in the first Iraq war. In other words, Kerry gave *conditional* support.

We have special forces in a lot of countries other than Iraq. They could
be transferred.

Um, people in Cleveland?

Ohio won't allow it.

If my life being in danger necessitated an emergency termination of
pregnancy, I do not consider that a "convenience."

<<It doesn't matter how you kill a baby, it's the fact that you are willing to kill another human

But, y'know...killing thousands of innocent brown people in a sandlot-country (that happens to be
sitting on the second largest reserves of oil in the world) using a thinly-veiled argument of
"liberation" so your friends can get some no bid contracts and make billions....

That's perfectly ok, cause, y'know...they're BROWN people.

And they're not American.

Typical liberal race-baiting.


Yeah, we went to Iraq with the sole intent of killing "brown people".   
Right.

Do you people even listen to yourselves?

You SHOULD read more of this.

Would you like to know how a partial-birth abortion is done?

Nothing less than disgusting and horrific.

Neat. And if so, it would be awesome to know that you would rather I died
than receive a medically-safer, life-saving abortion -- simply because my
description of the procedure was graphic and unpleasant to you.

Well, if you want to live off of the minimum wage,
then vote for Nader because he wants a living wage to
replace the minimum wage.   He's talking about $8.75
or higher.

I find it pretty amazing that Cheney had sex with his wife to produce that
daughter. That gives me the heebie-jeebies BIG TIME.

Nooooo, I was thinking more along the lines of England, or Germany, or
Iceland, or Japan ... we have military in countries all over the world.
(For example, during the Vietnam war, my father was stationed in Russia
doing training, and for part of WWII, my grandfather was stationed in Ohio
and Alabama).

No one has ever said that.  Read and learn:

 From the partial-birth law:

http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/PBAall110403.html

WHAT THE BILL DOES

The bill bans "partial-birth abortion," and it legally defines a  
partial-birth abortion as any abortion in which the baby is delivered  
"past the [baby's] navel . . . outside the body of the mother," OR "in the  
case of head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body  
of the mother," BEFORE being killed.  The complete official text of the  
bill being signed by President Bush, in a searchable format, is here:
http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/partial-birth%20abortion%20Ban%20act%20final%20language.htm

***The bill would allow the method if it was ever necessary to save a  
mother's life.  Such an exception has been part of the legislation since  
it was first introduced in 1995.***  Nevertheless, it is still not  
uncommon to see news reports that the bill would "never" allow the  
procedure, or to say flat out that it does not contain an exception to  
save a mother's life.  CBS Evening News, for example, has made this error  
repeatedly over the years.  An October 21, 2003, CBS Evening News report  
suggested twice that the bill would "never" allow a "late-term abortion,"  
a compound fallacy.

Yeah, good answer.  Vote Nader.  A guy who has no political party, so voting
for him doesn't help with federal funding.  A guy who has NO shot simply
because he's not on a lot of state's ballots.  A guy who, if he ever did get
elected, now would have to find his way through to actually get something
passed in a Congress that no doubt wouldn't even want him there.  A guy with
no political experience other than as a columnist. A guy who is basically
running this time to fund his own ego.  Fucking weee.

whether you feel abortion is right or not, you have to look at it this
way. there was a time when abortion was illegal. but women were still
getting them done. when they were getting them they were normally done
in unsterile environments, with unsterile equipment, and was normally
way mor risky for the woman. I am not saying that abortion is right, nor
do I think I could ever do it. but think about it this way, there is an
exception to every circumstance.. what about a rape victim who feels she
cannot keep the baby... sometimes it is justifyable (somewhat) would you
prefer these women going to a clean sterile office where they can have a
safe clean procedure, or in some bleak middle-of-nowhere place on a
kitchen table with a pair of scissors?

Which is why we need a cultural change as well as a legal change.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tonite : ODE TO GEORGE

the bottom line is you cant legislate morality...and thats the problem with
conservatives...you think that your morality should be everyones
morality...and thats just not going to happen.

anyways...who are you to impose your morals on anyone ian? werent you caught
dealing meth? dont you think thats just as bad abortion or even worse?  you
actually broke the law...someone who has an abortion isnt breaking the law.

Yes, you can.  Our founders did it when they wrote into the Constitution  
that every person has a right to Life, Liberty, and Property.  That  
includes unborn persons.  It's not a question of "differing morals", it's  
a question of life of humans.

Yeah, great, I got caught in a failed drug war started by a liberal  
Democrat peanut farmer.  That's EXACTLY the same.  Moron.

Um, what?

Abortion has killed approximately 40 MILLION people since 1973.  FORTY  
MILLION PEOPLE.

I sold 20 bags to my close friends for a period of 4 months.  Abortion has  
killed FORTY MILLION PEOPLE.

Please, if you're going to try to attack me, at least have some factual  
basis of some sort.

ruining a young adults life with meth addiction is far worse than
abortion....and dont even try to say meth isnt addictive...that shit is just
as bad as herion as far as im concerned...notice i said ruining, not
killing...so your numbers are irrelevant.

Wasn't sure if you knew this, but the "drug war" has it's roots in the 20's

Republican who needed to take some heat off of himself for Watergate.

Partial-Birth Abortion bans take lives:

There is no medical procedure called 'partial-birth abortion'.
Less than .02% of abortions are done that qualify under this new law.
Every one of those .02% of abortions are done to save the mother's life.
Soooo, what I'm saying is that .02% of women who had abortions last
year are most likely going to die because of this new law.
You can't morally legislate anything you don't understand.
Politicians aren't Doctors, for the most part.
Politicians need to get the fuck out of legislating medicine.

'nuff said.

Neither is going to happen, though it is always funny to watch a
'conservative' who usually argues that government should get out of
people's lives turn around and find another way for it to do just that.

Arguing about abortion is completely pointless. Nobody has ever changed
anyone's mind about it either way. You might as well bring up gun control
and religion while you're at it.

i really cant tell why any of you are trying to have a reasonable
discussion with entropy. in case you cant tell, none of his
positions are based on anything resembling reason. what you need
to do in situations like this is just start ripping on him, and
creating new ways to cause him physical harm and he'll just stop
replying. 

something like this would be good:

last night i put my asshole right on entropy's moms lips and shat
a nice 12" or so turd all the way down into her lungs.

There is nothing in the new law (that was passed overwhelmingly by a  
bipartisan Congress) that prohibits doing PBAs when a mother's life is  
involved:

http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/PBAall110403.html

"WHAT THE BILL DOES

The bill bans "partial-birth abortion," and it legally defines a  
partial-birth abortion as any abortion in which the baby is delivered  
"past the [baby's] navel . . . outside the body of the mother," OR "in the  
case of head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body  
of the mother," BEFORE being killed.  The complete official text of the  
bill being signed by President Bush, in a searchable format, is here:
http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/partial-birth%20abortion%20Ban%20act%20final%20language.htm

***The bill would allow the method if it was ever necessary to save a  
mother's life.  Such an exception has been part of the legislation since  
it was first introduced in 1995.***  Nevertheless, it is still not  
uncommon to see news reports that the bill would "never" allow the  
procedure, or to say flat out that it does not contain an exception to  
save a mother's life.  CBS Evening News, for example, has made this error  
repeatedly over the years.  An October 21, 2003, CBS Evening News report  
suggested twice that the bill would "never" allow a "late-term abortion,"  
a compound fallacy."


> You can't morally legislate anything you don't understand.


You can't discuss anything when you don't have the facts.

pre-empt regular programming to air a Kerry smear piece two weeks before the election. This
unprecedented move would be direct electioneering by a corporate media giant -- and against federal
election law.

Sinclair is apparently willing to take this risk to their business because this is an election that
hangs in the balance. It's our job to make them understand exactly the risk they face, if they
choose to pursue partisanship rather than a broadcaster's duty to the public or even their own
business interests.

It's time to fight fire with fire. Let's use a little "hit-em-in-the-wallet" trick that
conservatives have used against other "controversial" broadcasts for years...talk to their
advertisers!

http://www.boycottsbg.com/advertisers/default.aspx contains a list of contact info for companies
that do regular business on Sinclair's local outlets. Boycott these establishments, and, more
importantly, LET THEM KNOW WHY you're doing so. It's your money that these advertisers use...and you
have the right to let them know why they won't be receiving any more of that money.

Ah...capitalism!

One of the other things we can do is put pressure on each of the local stations, which have a
responsibility by law to serve their community interests. http://www.sinclairwatch.org/

For Pittsburgh:

WPGH, Fox 53 - Pittsburgh, PA - 412-931-5300
WCWB, WB 22 - Pittsburgh, PA - 412-931-5300

For Ohio:

There are no Cleveland OH affiliates.
WSTR, WB 64 - Cincinnati, OH - 513-641-4400
WSYX, ABC 6 - Columbus, OH - 614-481-6666
WKEF, NBC 22 - Dayton, OH - 937-263-2662 or 937-263-4500

SinclairWatch.org is a new site maintained by Free Press. Free Press is also encouraging citizens to
pledge to fight Sinclair stations' license renewals, if Sinclair follows through with using their
stations for electioneering. Real local opposition to license renewal will be taken very seriously.
If you don't have a station in your area, the site makes it easy for you to file a complaint with
the FCC and contact Sinclair's headquarters. Just click the link above to get started.

Israel Decriminalises Ecstasy

Israel's Justice Ministry announced this week that people caught in 
possession
of up to five ecstasy pills will no longer face prosecution, and explained 
that
the change is 'a case of adapting legislation to meet reality' (Ha'aretz,
Jerusalem).

However, the Ministry stressed that possession of even one pill will still 
be
technically a crime and explained the new category of 'personal use' is 
designed
to distinguished between users and suppliers.

The change coincided with the publication of a report in the UK by leading 
civil
liberties organisation Transform which predicted that all drugs will be
legalised in the UK by 2020.

"Drugs will be legalised in the not too distant future because prohibition 
is an
ongoing catastrophe of startling proportions," Transform director Danny 
Kushlick
said as he unveiled the report, titled 'After the War on Drugs, Options for
Control', at a presentation at Britain's Houses Of Parliament.

"We need to consider more effective, just and humane options," he continued. 
"In
the UK, the prison population and property crime would be halved, drug 
related
prostitution would end, opportunities for organised crime would reduce
substantially, prohibition related corruption would disappear and drug turf 
wars
would end," he said.

The 'drug policy road map report' was immediately dismissed by British Home
Office officials though was endorsed by a number of MPs and influential 
Brits
including former Times editor Simon Jenkins.

http://www.tdpf.org.uk/AboutUs_Introduction.htm ('Transform is seeking to 
reform
policies that have attempted to control drug use through criminal justice
enforcement, a failed approach that has been enormously destructive . . .')

Subject: {pb-cle} dems ufos in dem der hills

Romanian Ravers Terrorise Villagers

Villagers in the sleepy backwater town of Christinesti,Eastern Romania 
admitted
they were absolutely terrified last weekend, when thoughtless revellers 
staged
an open-air disco without warning the locals. The superstitious villagers
reportedly mistook the rave's flashing lights for alien spaceships and 
promptly
evacuated their homes fearing imminent attack.

"We believed we were seeing UFOs and some old legends from around here about
clocks stopping, animals going crazy and a previous UFO landing in the area
suddenly came to our minds," Costel Roman explained.

"We were so happy when we heard we had escaped an alien invasion," he added
(Ananova).

Also in Romania, Constantin Mocanu, 67, made an even worse error of judgment
this week, when, attempting to execute a noisy bird who had just woken him 
up,
chopped off his own penis by mistake.

"I confused it with the chicken's neck. I cut it," the Galati native 
admitted,
"and then the dog rushed and ate it," he added (Romania's state news agency
Rompres/ Reuters).

Mr Mocano's nightmarish tale echoed the equally bizarre explanation of 33 
year
old chicken obsessed Cambodian Soun Ney who cut off his penis with a 
butcher's
knife earlier this year after dreaming that he was being pursued by ravenous
demons.

"Devils, I don't have any chicken or duck for you," Mr Soun Ney said he'd
shouted as he battled with his imaginary foes. "If you want to eat anything, 
you
can eat my penis."

http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~vampire/vhist.html (Romanian vampire legends: 
'Female
vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would exhaust 
the
husband. Anyone who had a hideous appearance, was missing a finger, or had
animal appendages, etc. was believed to be a vampire . . .')

Dunno; I just had a non-jewish friend get shipped to the middle east
for a month.  He claimed that Israel was really, really nice, and the
people were friendly to him.  Egypt and Saudi Arabia, not so hot, both
for different reasons.

Dunno; I just had a non-jewish friend get shipped to the middle east
for a month.  He claimed that Israel was really, really nice, and the
people were friendly to him.  Egypt and Saudi Arabia, not so hot, both
for different reasons.

Following that logic, "Property" means we should own slaves.    What =20
was written over 200 years ago does not necessarily apply to today's =20
social climate or culture.   The right to life is certainly not a law =20=

of nature.   It is a law that humanity has imposed on itself.  Just =20
like the right to bear arms, or liberty or property.   A right decreed, =20=

no less, at a time when medical industries had no control over  infant =20=

mortality rates and disease-  nature's population control mechanisms.   =20=

Abortion is just as effective a means of population control as any =20
nature once had to offer.   And since fewer minority babies are in =20
demand than white ones, and since orphanages still raise children to =20
adulthood in this country, adoption isn't the solution.   Perhaps, any =20=

government who not only advocates but forces abortion, should do so,  =20=

if the threat of growing population will dwindle resources for the =20
population that already exists.   Even if we change the way our =20
resources are allocated, over population may be a detriment to =20
humanity.  Our constitution was written based on the Utilitarian ideal =20=

that the needs of the many out weigh the needs of a few.  Population =20
control might just be a responsible administrative policy to have.  =20
Maybe, a socially responsible society should only breed a generation to =20=

replace itself.  Especially a society that has conquered infant =20
mortality and disease much the way this one has.   An evolved society =20=

should recognize that human nature's desire to copulate  is outside the =20=

boundaries of it's control and thus abstinence is not a viable =20
preventive measure against pregnancy, and furthermore, abortion.  =20
However, the advocation of birth control is not outside those =20
boundaries, and could prevent many more abortions than occur if more =20
used it before pregnancy occured.

Advocation of war seems to undermine pro-life positions, as does =20
Capital Punishment.  If Pro-Lifers hold that,"... Every person, however =20=

frail or vulnerable, has a place and a purpose in this world." =20
(Republican Party Platform), then surely soldiers and civilian victims =20=

are no exception, nor can offenders of any kind be excepted from that =20=

rule, since they too are "vulnerable" to their potential executioners =20=

in the same way that a fetus is to abortion practitioners.  However, if =20=

Pro-Lifers hold that the good of the many is indeed the result of the =20=

sacrifice of soldiers and civilians in war, and the imposed death of =20
offenders who might offend again,  then they must also hold that =20
abortion may indeed benefit the good of the many as  perhaps described =20=

in the paragraph above.  If the "Right to Life" is upheld as a =20
universal law, then war is illegal, as is capital punishment- if =20
abortion is.  If one does not hold that life is a right in the first =20
place, then one is not in conflict when pro-life for the unborn and =20
pro-death for the living as conservatives or right wingers often seem, =20=

or vice-versa as liberals tend to be, in practice.  If we take away the =20=

right to life, then no one is a hypocrite.  But we don't need to do =20
that, because the ability to amend the constitution and Bill of Rights, =20=

came with their inception to begin with--(done because the founders had =20=

enough vision to understand that things change, and so should laws, to =20=

keep up)--followed  by court case decisions used as precedent for =20
judging the actions of people within society--making the taking of some =20=

lives justifiable, in self-defense, in defense of others,  in war, in =20=

capital punishment, and in abortion--consistently undermining the =20
universality of the original, clearly subjective (especially in =20
practice),  "right to life" rule.  So shut up about the "right to life".

No, because we changed that.  (Well, I should say, the Republicans changed  
that)

I am a dues paying member of the Massachussetts Right-To-Life Coalition,  
which funds private adoption and abortion-alternative programs.

I also have a brother with Aspergers Syndrome, who comes down to Boston  
and stays with me every couple of months.


However, I don't need to "justify" my principles to you or anyone by  
"working on behalf of kids" or anything else.

As I said:  I am a dues paying member of the Massachussetts Right-To-Life  
Coalition, which funds private adoption and abortion-alternative programs.

It's not the government's job to provide these services.  The private  
sector does it better anyway.

It's not the government's job to provide these services.  The private  
sector does it better anyway (as they do most things)

Naw.  They knew he was American; apparently, after mountains of

I've bluffed Canadian before when travelling.  It helps, sometimes.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: [dcraves] NRR: Abortion

Anyways, yes, a partial birth abortion is essentially killing the
child by sucking it's brains out.  I was born nine weeks premature,
and before this law, would have been fair game to this procedure.

If you can find me a doctor who'd be willing to perform this procedure
without the mother's life being completely in jeopardy, I'd be fucking
horrified.  It's *only* done when the mother is going to die if it
isn't.

It's a choice between....

MOTHER IS ALIVE.....  MOTHER IS DEAD, BABY IS DEAD.
and
MOTHER IS ALIVE....   BABY IS DEAD.


Essentiallly, it's the *only* form of abortion that's easy to make a
moral argument *for*.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: [dcraves] NRR: Abortion

Melzie called for end-of-thread to this one on DCRaves, so carrying
this this way.

After looking through Entropy's links for the better part of the last
15 minutes, I can't actually find the text of the damn bill, just
die-hard-pro-lifers' interpretations of it.

If it actually allows the loophole for 'serious medical need' of the
mother, then so be it; *great* idea.  :)

Israel is awesome. A girlfriend of mine has been there quite a few 
times, and has told me of nothing but amazing experiences. Granted, 
things are pretty safe when the best army in the world (yeah, the 
Israelis) is prepared to jump out of a sand pit to crush skulls at the 
drop of a hat.

Plus, this place spawned Infected Mushroom amongst other awesome 
Israeli live acts.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Israel Decriminalises Ecstasy

no way id ever go there....things might be a little quiet right now cuz of
ramadan...but it will heat up again at the end of the month....what we hear
on american TV about what happens over there isnt half the truth...but
american TV is more focused on the mess in irakistan than they are about the
mess in isreal right now.

the israelis might love americans cuz we give them all that nice military
hardware...but there are plenty of muslims that would love to blow an
american's head off there too

you're best off going to amsterdam and pretending your canadian.

Does anybody remember his old mixtape, from like '96 i
think, that came in a silver film canister and was
supposed to be the soundtrack to a movie he was doing.
I can't remember the name of it, but did he ever
actually come out with the movie.

that was the director's cut, a bulletproof tape from 98 or 99. it
wasnt related to a real movie, just a hypothetical one. not my
favorite mix of his either, it was nowhere near the classic
"witness the strength" or "supreme" or his side of the east coast
science tape. you can DL all of those from his site, if you dont
already have them you need to go get them. far and away the best
jungle mixes ive ever heard. thats what really got me hooked back
in 96.

yeah its really bananas to think about how good he was. all of my
old deez tapes snapped from being played too much, i just about
cried each time one went down. i was so happy when he finally put
them online. i actually need to make cassette copies of them to
listen to in my car. that will take me back.

that was around the same time as the 611 mix cd, i didnt really
like either of those too much.

well, to be most exact, it was deez's tapes and his set at "that
thing" in sept 96, sine and his sets at the one sunshine kids rave
in nov 96, and 187's live sets i saw around early 97. i cant
possibly say enough about how those 3 cats ran things jungle wise
in 96. that shit was insane. thats not even giving the credit to
all the other cats who were holding it down on a regular basis, i
loved pretty much all that era of pgh jungle deejays for their
individuality.

well wasnt his "i dont fucking spin jungle anymore" tape from mid
96? i was referring more to people like saint, adair, ^2, etc.
even some of the people who were just playing records at house
parties like my boy al whom i havent seen in like 5 years were
killer deejays.

I'm voting for Kerry this time around.

Amanda, I appreciate that...Entropy is a Neocon in disguise (or denial) as a Libertarian, and thusly
has been defending Bush's policies each and every time we've brought up a fault.

I've got no problem with Libertarians.

I DO have a problem with ill-informed, bandwagoning neocon crack-smokers in an unmovable state of
denial about the basic principles of a flawed leadership.

you should. completely free markets are essentially a license for 
corporations to run things. while i appreciate other ideas that 
are considered libertarian, that whole idea just makes them look 
like morons.

I am a registered Libertarian (although I have some big problems with some
of their platform and don't really consider myself one of them) and I know
many other Libertarians and I only know of one of them who is planning on
voting for Bush but he is a religious zealot and bigot and I think Bush
panders to those types so I can see why.

Freedom lovers agree: Kerry is the lesser of two evils this time around.

insanity abounds.  incase someone has been just deleting emails from our

Sounds like a good idea at this point.

honestly, libertarians are just as big a bunch of nutcases as the
republicans. the right is pretty much useless except for a couple
aspects of libertarianism that they stole from the left:
legalization of drugs and general privacy issues. these issues are
not strictly libertarian. the strictly libertarian issues like
trusting free markets and corporations more than the government
are just nutcase type issues. if you really believe in those kinds
of things, you should probably see a psychiatrist.

But how many times have I seen Government compared to Corporation, 
especially by left-wing oriented people?

Who says trusting any of them isn't a nutcase idea?

At least I stand a better chance of landing a decent job if I stick with the 
corporations...?

What a horrible night to have a curse.

We can all tell how free markets have just been so horrible for this
country, what with everyone waiting in bread lines every day. If you
trust the government at all, you're just dumb. At least corporations
need to earn your money to survive - government can take it whether you
want to give it up or not.

Corporations don't have to exist at all in a libertarian system, since
they are creations of the government to begin with.

To be completely anecdotal, the job that I have at a university is
infinitely better than any job I've had with a corporation.  Corporations

Well, I don't know...

I am treated very well by my employers, even for being at the bottom of the 
totem pole.

It would seem that would all be dependant on the company and it's 
supervisors...

Our Government doesn't seem very efficient at all and I would rather not 
have it dictate my money. Even though, deep down, I don't think it is really 
going to make one hell of a difference.


What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Speaking of Libertarians and Bush

Oh, I know there are plenty of progressively-minded corporations out
there...Google comes to mind...but things that corporations generally
provide now, like health insurance for employees and their families and a
minimum wage and other benefits are things that pure capitalists do not
like.  For capitalists it is all about the money.  That is the bottom
line.  They can dress it up any way that they like ("If you can control
your own money you control your own destiny" which is a flawed argument)
but that's really what it's all about.  The philosophy of capitalism as
put forth by people like Smith sounds good on paper, everyone taking care
of themselves and all of that, but it really doesn't work out when put
into practice in a society.  It actually begins to resemble the world
envisioned by Hobbes in The Leviathan.  This is not to say that other
economic systems have really worked when put into practice, like
Communism, especially since they were run by mass murdering greedy
fuckheads.  But it is to say that if you want to have a society in which
no one worries about their fellow human beings or the greater good, then
it's just going to eat itself alive.  It is NOT a society.  Plenty of
people like to say that capitalism is working, but for the millions, nay,
billions of people that are getting fucked over by it, it's really not. 
Of course, the predictable answer to that is, "They're not working hard
enough bootstraps Alger blah blah blah."  You can't win.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Speaking of Libertarians and Bush

Well here's an example for you --

The telecom act of 1996 de-regulated aspects the telephone industry. 
Have you seen your phone bills go down or up?  It was supposed to
promote competition, but I haven't seen my local or long distance
phone bills go down a drop! (talking land lines here).  In fact some
carriers make it cheaper to call canada (.07 a minute) than to call
the US!

Without government regulation in the first place, there would be no
universal service fund, and no one in rural areas would be able to
afford phone service, because it costs tons more to provide it to
rural customers than to urban customers.

If you let corporations run the country and remove government, you'd
quickly see a whole lot of crazy things happen.  Like Tom said, their
interest is not in the good of society, but in the value they provide
for their shareholders.  Those things, while not necessarily mutually
exclusive, certainly aren't parallell.

Don't take me as defending corporations too strongly, either. One the
scale of bad entities, they really are just below government.

"We can all tell how free markets have just been so horrible for this
country, what with everyone waiting in bread lines every day."

Our market are regulated (international trade, healthcare, telecom, just to name some huge ones)

 

" If you trust the government at all, you're just dumb. At least corporations
need to earn your money to survive - government can take it whether you
want to give it up or not."

 

You may be correct that trusting our current government system isn't smart, but we live in a plutocratic nation.   Corporations give politicians money to get elected, then politicians vote for policies that help their campaign funders in their respective businesses.  So corporations can "earn" your money by making some well placed payments to proper political group.  The line between government and corporation is more blurred than you make it sound here.

I was talking purely in terms of how I have been treated.  I guess there
are just more socialists hanging around a university, but as far as
needing time off, and benefits, they're much more flexible than a
corporation.  And I can't get fired for dumb shit like being late 4 times
in one year or some such nonsense.  Well, I could, but it's not very
likely.  Paul said that he's more likely to get a better job with a
corporation and I was just pointing out that my university job is much
bomber than any corporate one I've had.

Like I said in my last email, I'm no fan of corporations. The free market
could function just as well (and possibly better) if they didn't exist at
all. If you wanted to start a business, it would be your business - if
your business rips someone off, *you* would be the one paying for the
crime.

Or so you imagine. No, libertarians believe that people have the right to
have their private interactions stay private. If a corporation is harming
people, or the environment, or whatever, they should be as liable as
anyone else.

Semi-rational? You must be joking. Something like 45% of those
semi-rational people are going to vote for Bush in 2 weeks. They'd vote
themselves into jail cells if they thought it would prevent another attack
on The Homeland.

So explain why you don't vote again...

The issue is excessive control. I don't have to interact with a
corporation at all unless I choose to.

Government does have legitimate functions. Road building/national
defense/law enforcement. You also seem to be confused about the roles of
the federal government and local governments. If a city wants to pass a
law that they are going to tax people at 90% and hand it out to poor
people, that should be allowed as long as people are free to move
somewhere else.

Third world sweatshow wages are coming with or without government
regulations. A system that depends on artificially inflated wages is going
to fail.

Socialists are far more worthless than any of the above. They sit around
and wish instead of actually doing anything.

Right. Because freedom is so bourgeoise.

Universities tend to pay far less than private jobs, but be much
cushier with the benefits/work enviroment.

Depends on where you work, I guess. I get 25 paid days off per year, can
take those days pretty much whenever I want, full medical, dental, vision,
401k that matched at 150% last year - and I work for a huge corporation.
Not that I have any trust that they won't outsource my job as soon as they
get a chance, though...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hey entropy...

<<Sorry, I don't have a subscription to any liberal media sites.>>

OK. Then I'll excerpt a few of the choice pieces for you:
************************************************
In the summer of 2002, after I had written an article in Esquire that the White House didn't like
about Bush's former communications director, Karen Hughes, I had a meeting with a senior adviser to
Bush. He expressed the White House's displeasure, and then he told me something that at the time I
didn't fully comprehend -- but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.

The aide said that guys like me were ''in what we call the reality-based community,'' which he
defined as people who ''believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible
reality.'' I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me
off. ''That's not the way the world really works anymore,'' he continued. ''We're an empire now, and
when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -- judiciously, as
you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how
things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study
what we do.''

Who besides guys like me are part of the reality-based community? Many of the other elected
officials in Washington, it would seem. A group of Democratic and Republican members of Congress
were called in to discuss Iraq sometime before the October 2002 vote authorizing Bush to move
forward. A Republican senator recently told Time Magazine that the president walked in and said:
''Look, I want your vote. I'm not going to debate it with you.'' When one of the senators began to
ask a question, Bush snapped, ''Look, I'm not going to debate it with you.''
------------------------------------------------------------------
Bruce Bartlett, a domestic policy adviser to Ronald Reagan and a treasury official for the first
President Bush, told me recently that ''if Bush wins, there will be a civil war in the Republican
Party starting on Nov. 3.'' The nature of that conflict, as Bartlett sees it? Essentially, the same
as the one raging across much of the world: a battle between modernists and fundamentalists,
pragmatists and true believers, reason and religion.

''Just in the past few months,'' Bartlett said, ''I think a light has gone off for people who've
spent time up close to Bush: that this instinct he's always talking about is this sort of weird,
Messianic idea of what he thinks God has told him to do.'' Bartlett, a 53-year-old columnist and
self-described libertarian Republican who has lately been a champion for traditional Republicans
concerned about Bush's governance, went on to say: ''This is why George W. Bush is so clear-eyed
about Al Qaeda and the Islamic fundamentalist enemy. He believes you have to kill them all. They
can't be persuaded, that they're extremists, driven by a dark vision. He understands them, because
he's just like them. . . .

''This is why he dispenses with people who confront him with inconvenient facts,'' Bartlett went on
to say. ''He truly believes he's on a mission from God. Absolute faith like that overwhelms a need
for analysis. The whole thing about faith is to believe things for which there is no empirical
evidence.'' Bartlett paused, then said, ''But you can't run the world on faith.''
----------------------------------------------

Yep. Those sound like good libertarian principles to me.

Please give an example of the above.  Tell the list
which socialist you know, and give an example of a
socialist state where nothing is done.  This is a
blanket statement not based on fact.

Sweden.

Only 1/4 of the country works in a real non-government job.

No they haven't.  Reagan, Bush Sr, and GWB all single-handedly campaigned  
AGAINST David Duke when he ran.

Sweden's per capita GDP is $20k, #24 in the world.
 
Yeah, they sit around doing nothing....
They whip America's ass in basic reading and math, healthcare, and 
renewable energy.
 
Luxemborg's per capita GDP is $37k  #1 in the world, and they're a 
socialist state.
 
 
I'm not advocating a socialist system in the US, but I will take the 
time
to point out ingnorant statements about socialism and references to 
irrelevant books.

Sweden.

Only 1/4 of the country works in a real non-government job.

I loaned Eat The Rich to my fiancee's father so I don't have the actual

Good to be King

Michael Badnarik's book, entitled Good to be King: The Foundation of
our Constitutional Freedom, is now available in print. It may be
purchased at *http://tinyurl.com/5tyno {http://tinyurl.com/5tyno}.
*Since we announced approximately 15 hours ago that the book is now
available, it has already reached the top 200 sellers at Amazon.com.

Endorsements

Some recent organizational endorsements for Michael Badnarik come
from:

Pink Pistols
NonInterventionist.com

As well as these recent individual endorsements:

Doug Stanhope, comedian and host of Girls Gone Wild
Penn Jillette, magician and half of Penn and Taylor
Jonathan David Morris, political satirist, Men's News Daily
Alan Bock, senior editorial writer of the Orange County Register
James Leroy Wilson, columnist, Partial Observer
Karen Kwiatkowski, Lt. Col. USAF (ret.), columnist, Military Week
Robert Eckhardt, Ph.D, professor of kinesiology, Penn State
University
Jonathan Hoenig, columnist, Capitalist Pig, Fox News, and many major
financial publications
Vin Suprynowicz, assistant editor, Las Vegas Review-Journal
Lance Lamberton, former Reagan deputy director of the White House
Office of Policy Information
Marty Nemko, Ph.D., syndicated columnist, San Francisco Chronicle
L. Neil Smith, science fiction author, three-time Prometheus
Award-winner
Jim Peron, award winning editor and author
Tonie Nathan, first women to ever win an electoral vote

Commercials

We are please to announce that two national television runs will soon
begin featuring the latest Badnarik commercial. We have already run
extensive television advertising campaigns in Nevada and New Mexico.
Commercials have also aired in Tennessee and Georgia. In addition to
the national buys, television commercials will be airing in Alabama
(with some Florida overlap), Arkansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas
and Wisconsin over the next few days. There are a few more states in
the works right now, as well.

Fundraising

We had a pretty exciting night, when we closed out our latest online
fundraising campaign last night. With a stated goal of $53,200 for
this drive, we ended up with over $90,000. Thanks to all of you who
made this fundraiser such a wonderful success.

For Courage of Conviction

Michael Badnarik recently accepted the American Muslim Alliance's
Al-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz Malcolm X Award "on behalf of the
Libertarian, Green and Independent parties."

Named for the civil rights activist and Muslim convert, assassinated
in 1965, the award is inscribed:

"For showing courage of conviction in upholding American ideals, for
demonstrating total honesty and integrity in dealing with fellow
Americans of all religions, colors and creeds, and for doing the right
thing at the right time and for the right reason. The coalescence of
their convictions and commitments will be remembered as the
institutionalization of a US-wide civil rights movement."

Internet

As usual, our Internet traffic is soaring. Nader still has not been
able to approach our level of site visitors - and we continue to get
closer to the Bush and Kerry level of traffic. Our blog is considered
a source for news articles, and the excitement continues to build
there daily.

We just added a new forum feature on the site, and we are adding other
material - including audio and video, on a daily basis.

If you haven't stopped by recently, check it out at

I think Switzerland keeps out of the red also.
But their lack of debt is directly correlated to the fact that
they hold much of this oil money in their banking system.

Out of 27 million eligible voters under age 25, only 10 million 
voted in the 2000 election. In six different states, the election 
was decided by less than 10,000 votes. If even 1% more of the 
eligible voters under age 25 had gone to the polls, our generation 
could have changed the course of history. Don't let history repeat 
itself!
Margins of victory in the 2000 Presidential election:

New Mexico: 366 votes
Florida: 537 votes
Iowa: 4,144 votes Wisconsin: 5,708 votes
Oregon: 6,765 votes

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Oct 30                      FUCK THE VOTE                    Pittsburgh

[still on, but POH pulled out, i'm sure theres a party in my pants joke 
to be dropped here]

Pursuit of Happiness has CANCELLED our participation in Fuck the Vote on 
October 30, 2004.

Our events often involve cooperation between members of our own core 
group and others. When differences of opinion exist, we try to 
compromise as much as possible to ensure that everyone is satisfied with 
what we would accomplish. In this case, we came to a simple 
determination that the necessary compromises would fail to accomplish 
our goals, and so we have withdrawn.

Note that there are no hard feelings on our part, and the hard work that 
went into making this event take place is something we respect and we 
will give full support if and when we may be asked to do so. The name of 
the party may change, the line-up we had been prepared to announce may 
change, even the date and venue we intended to use may change, any and 
all details are no longer our decisions to make. It is not our party 
now, it will not be a PoH event.

I am sorry to all of those who were looking forward to this.

Earning a sponsorship by Stanton Magnetics, Anna & her scratch partner 
DJ Shortee form Stantons first female scratch duo "Twice as Nice. 
Anna combines breakbeat and electro with DMC style trickery & is known 
for rocking the crowd!.

-DJ Booth (Louisville, KY  Urban Loops, UFO Jeans, 4-Score) House
Fists in the air: Chaos reigns. For 8 years DJ Booth has dominated the 
midwest, headlining with international acts and struggling for what he 
now holds so dear  an extensive play history of dates nationally and 
internationally, an insurmountable fan base, multiple original 
compositions released nationwide, six mixed CD's, an appointment as a 
promotional rep by the UFO clothing company, and a rockin' remix of "Up 
to You" by Robbie Hardkiss of the famous Hardkiss brothers.

-Rob Riddum (Cleveland  J&N Media) Dnb/Hip-Hop turntablist
One of the key figures of the Element Squad returns to Cleveland. While 
in LA, Rob was working out of the old Beastie Boys studio Grand 
Royale where his main project was www.bradleyhiphop.com. Rob recently 
took home 3rd place at the Salt Lake City DMC. Come see this old skool 
turntablist wreck the decks.

-Kryteria (Curtis R & Patrick Felony  Miami  Breakline Crew) DnB
Playing prestigious events like Ultra Music Festival, Global Gathering, 
and Magical Maydaze has many djs and producers stateside and worldwide 
supporting this dynamic duo by playing their tunes and crowds all over 
are eating them up! With the likes of Karl K and Kaos behind these 
original bad boys none can contest!

-Ewun & Code-D (Rochester, NY  Evol Intent Recordings, Rocdnb, 
Skyehigh, Breakline Crew, La Selva) DnB/Dancehall/Turntablism
Ewun and Code-D are two of NYs most versatile dj's. Known for creative 
mixes and impressive scratch abilities, these two have grown to become 
professionals behind the decks. Code-D has mastered the ability to 
switch styles with ease and his scratching skills are sharp. Ewun has 
just been signed to Evol Intent Recordings, with other releases in the 
works on some of the industries top labels. With DJ support from Evol 
Intent, Tech Itch, Dylan, B-Key, just to name a few, expect to hear a 
lot of noise from this rising artist.

-The Lady Foursquare - (Louisville, KY - UFO Jeans) House
Name another woman who can hold it down right beside Paul Johnson after 
DEMF 2002, tag with Trevor Lamont (Teamsters), share a residency with 
DJs Kit Chaps of VHS or Beta (Astralwerks) and rock the main stage next 
to Terry Mullan, Diego Ro-k and Dieselboy: Foursquare is supporting UFO 
Jeans and her CD, "What Happened?" this fall.

-Jon Doe ( Skratch Fienz / Cleveland) DNB, Hip Hop, Turntablism
Jon Doe is one of the most talented DJ's in Cleveland and yet unknown to 
those outside Cleveland. Jon Doe has been spinning for over 10 years now 
and continues to progress every day. Jon Doe works seven days a week, 
almost twelve hours a day, but he always finds time to get out and play, 
doing what he loves most, blowing ur mind. Talented in so many different 
areas of music Jon Doe is sure to impress!

-Robtronix and MC Barrenzemo (Koala Tea / P3 - DNB & MC) Cleveland
His funky flavor will captivate you within the first second of hearing 
him. Don't let him fool ya by the "i'm a nice boy" smile, like anyone of 
us we have a bad side and he puts that into his music. His thoughts are 
the drums and bass, his voice is the scratch.

-Shagge (Breaks) Cleveland
Shagge is one of the most amazing Breaks DJ's u will ever see...No more 
needs to be said!

-DJ Moose (Break Beat Militia / Breaks, Jump Up Jungle) Cleveland
Moose's unique style sprouts from his hip-hop influence. Blending 
hip-hop with breaks and jungle as well as keeping the crowd entertained 
has been moose's goal and motivation from the start. "All I want to do 
is make the whole crowd bounce, yall!", a sample of Snoop Doggy Dogg in 
a J-Smooth track, is what Moose uses as a slogan for every performance.

each rebirth each life gone each death we cause
brightens the flicker in thine eye

Subject: {pb-cle} Midnight Mixer::Saturday October 30th::Cleveland

The next Midnight Mixer - "All Hallows Eve" - is less than a week away...

No doubt there are many choices of parties and other events to 
attend.  Choice is a good thing because you can get closer to exactly 
what you want.  So it is up to you to figure out what you are looking 
for...

What we do is cutting edge electronic music and video properly 
presented in a great venue filled with Cleveland's seekers...

Surf to http://www.midnightmixer.com for info, pictures, and mp3 
previews for each of the performers.

One major addition is a screening of "Nosferatu" with live score by 
SynthCleveland members luigi-bob drake, notech, and tofu. "Nosferatu" 
is a silent film and the musicians will improvise the soundtrack. 
The film starts at 9:00pm.  Attend the film and admission to the 
entire event is free.  What better way to see *the* original horror 
flick - but on Halloween in a 100 year old dark church?

Costumes or masks are encouraged!  Visit John's Funhouse on East 
185th, Chelsea's Vintage Clothing at West 116th and Detroit, or any 
JoAnn Fabrics for a kickstart.  Don't wait until Saturday to think 
about a costume!

Feel free to email with questions or suggestions...

Ramzi

Michael Moore was in the lobby of my work yesterday eating breakfast.  I 
swear he was shoving like 4 bearclaws in his mouth at a time.  He had powder 
sugar all over the place, it was pretty entertaining.

To sum up: Anything beyond the limited powers expressly delegated by the

For an American conservative, better one lost election than the continued
empowerment of cynical men who abuse conservatism through an exercise of
power unrestrained by principle through the compromise of conservative
beliefs.=20

George W. Bush claims to be conservative. But based upon the unwholesome
intrusion into domestic life and personal liberty of his administration and
the local governments who imitate it, George W. Bush is no conservative, no
friend of limited, constitutional government=8Band no friend of freedom.

The Republic would be better served by his defeat in November =8B William Bry=

Subject: {pb-cle} Rave The Vote 2004!

Lovers of electronic dance music! This election year is counting on you to  
Rave-The-Vote and turn out in record numbers supporting
George W. Bush!

The Democrats have been waging their War-On-Dance over the last several  
years, by introducing many laws targeted to stop your right to
attend dance music events. Many promoters, DJs, and record labels have  
gone out of business due to their legislative actions.


If you wonder: What happened to the scene? you can thank the Democrats  
for legislating it into the state it is in today.  Many rave
and nightclub promoters have gone out of business due to their legislation.


It's time to put your vote where your heart is, stand up for individual  
freedom and stop the Democrats right-grabbing madness!  This
years presidential election looks to be a close one, and its important  
for you to get out the vote for George W Bush and Republican
representatives.


The Democrats for many years have been trying to portray themselves as a  
party more in line with the dance music community, but their
actions have spoken much louder than their words.  Their words have  
turned out to be only lies and misinformation.  Some Democratic
senators have even been campaigning at dance music events!  Dont let the  
Democrats fool you and stab us in the back again.

If you want the government to keep their hands off your right to dance,  
and you support the freedoms of small business owners such as
promoters and DJs, then the Republican Party is the party for you!


Democratic legislation attacking your rights to assemble and dance:

(From: www.senate.gov)


The "RAVE" Act was originally introduced during the 107th Congress by  
Democrat Senator Joe Biden.

"Enacting this legislation will help prosecute unscrupulous promoters who  
seek to profit from exploiting and endangering young lives,"
said Biden. "This law is not aimed at one type of event or drug. However,  
one problem we are currently facing nationwide involves so-
called "club drugs" and raves.


Ecstasy Awareness Act of 2003 (H. R. 2962)

`Whoever profits monetarily from a rave or similar electronic dance event,  
knowing or having reason to know that the unlawful use or
distribution of a controlled substance occurs at the rave or similar  
event, shall be fined not more than $500,000 or imprisoned not
more than 20 years, or both. If the defendant is an organization, the fine  
imposable for the offense is not more than $2,000,000.


RAVE Act (HR 718 IH)

To prohibit an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining, managing,  
controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or
profiting from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing,  
or using any controlled substance, and for other purposes.


Clean, Learn, Educate, Abolish, Neutralize, and Undermine Production  
(CLEAN-UP) of Methamphetamines Act (H.R.834)

`Whoever, for a commercial purpose, knowingly promotes any rave, dance,  
music, or other entertainment event, that takes place under
circumstances where the promoter knows or reasonably ought to know that a  
controlled substance will be used or distributed in violation
of Federal law or the law of the place where the event is held, shall be  
fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned for
not more than 9 years, or both.'.

So a couple Dems snuck the Rave Act into the Amber Alert Bill. This is in
some way worse than the Dubya-supported Patriot Act?

(My mother is still trying to figure out why Secret Service stopped by her
house looking for her a couple weeks after she participated in a peaceful
Bush protest. Honestly, we can't figure this out and she's a little
freaked out by it, to say the least.)

Silly rabbit, no reasonable person honestly thinks it's unAmerican to
criticize those in power.

Wait a minute ... you're not one of those wackos who thinks the Bill of
Rights should be repealed, are you?

Anyway, my 57-year-old mother may certainly be considered a pretty strong
threat to President Bush. After all, not only is she a devout Christian,
she was also on active-duty in the U.S. Army for 7 years before her
decision to stay home and raise her children. Try calling her "unAmerican"
to her face sometime -- I'd LOVE to see that.

Amanda

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rave The Vote 2004!

This is the most ridiculous argument for Bush I've ever heard.

First off you're being incredibly partisan by blaming the death of "the
scene" solely on all Democrats.  I have serious issues with the legislation
you presented also, but am I to understand that the reasoning is as follows?

Given
(1) some Democrats write some legislation that may or may not have had
deleterious effects on the dance music scene
(2) Kerry is a Democrat
Infer: Kerry is bad and you should vote for Bush

This analysis is frighteningly simplistic and ignorant.

If you want to talk about denying rights, look no further than the
Republican platform.  It adamantly states that gay and lesbian relationships
of any form whether civil union or marriage shouldn't be recognized.  To
Bush's credit, he has come out against the platform and stated that he
believes in civil unions.  Still I find his support of the Defense of
Marriage Act appalling.  Using the Constitution to deny certain Americans
rights makes me sick.

Then there's the Patriot Act.  I'm not even going to get into it; this reply
is getting long enough.

Secondly and most importantly, there are issues in this election that are
more pressing by orders of magnitude.  What about the economy? Social
security?  The f'd up situation in Iraq?  Handling terrorism?  The state of
international relations?  The environment?

What a load of bs.

Personally, I'm voting for Kerry because I like where he stands on the
issues.  I think the Bush administration has been a catastrophe.  For a guy
who wasn't even rightfully elected, he's really done a job on this country.
I hate that things have devolved to the point where the word "un-American"
gets thrown at anyone who disagrees with the administration.

You may feel differently than me and that's cool but for goodness sake get
informed.  And do yourself a favor and watch less FOX News.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rave The Vote 2004!

A little something for Mr Entropy the 'conservative'
from the article John Tab posted up.  This is the
definition of 'conservative that I agree with, not the
neoconservative imperialism that we're faced with now.
 It's kind of funny that the democratic party is
really closer to this definition than the neocons.

"Theodore Roosevelt, that most virile of presidents,
insisted that, "To announce that there should be no
criticism of the president, or that we are to stand by
the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic
and servile, but is morally treasonable to the
American people." With that in mind, I say: George W.
Bush is no conservative, and his unprincipled
abandonment of conservatism under the pressure of
events is no statesmanship. The Republic would be
well-served by his defeat this November.

William F. Buckley's recent retirement from the
National Review, nearly half a century after he
founded it, led me to reflect on American
conservatism's first principles, which Buckley helped
define for our time. Beneath Buckley's scintillating
phrases and rapier wit lay, as Churchill wrote of Lord
Birkenhead, "settled and somewhat somber conclusions
upon questions about which many people are content to
remain in placid suspense": that political and
economic liberty were indivisible; that government's
purpose was protecting those liberties; that the
Constitution empowered government to fulfill its
proper role while restraining it from the
concentration and abuse of power; and that its genius
lay in the Tenth Amendment, which makes explicit that
the powers not delegated to government are reserved to
the states or to the people."

The entire article is linked below (whoever posts
stuff for nation posted it first - John Tab?)

http://www.nypress.com/17/31/news&columns/WilliamBryk.cfm?page=1&last=3

Its a good read, particularly for those who consider
themselves to be politically conservative.

And you would expect something other than that from someone who so staunchly supports Bush?

"Frighteningly simplistic and ignorant" has been the modus operandi of this country's government
since September 12, 2001.

<<To Bush's credit, he has come out against the platform and stated that he believes in civil
unions.>>

Simply to save SOME of the gay vote...you'd be surprised how many wealthy homosexuals there are out
there...those are potential donors, people! Leave no dollar behind!!

....Oh, and W would probably rather not have a complete mutiny on his hands when his
puppet-master/Vice President bails due to his daughter being a lesbian!

A little something for Mr Entropy the 'conservative'
from the article John Tab posted up.  This is the
definition of 'conservative that I agree with, not the
neoconservative imperialism that we're faced with now.
 It's kind of funny that the democratic party is
really closer to this definition than the neocons.

"Theodore Roosevelt, that most virile of presidents,
insisted that, "To announce that there should be no
criticism of the president, or that we are to stand by
the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic
and servile, but is morally treasonable to the
American people." With that in mind, I say: George W.
Bush is no conservative, and his unprincipled
abandonment of conservatism under the pressure of
events is no statesmanship. The Republic would be
well-served by his defeat this November.

William F. Buckley's recent retirement from the
National Review, nearly half a century after he
founded it, led me to reflect on American
conservatism's first principles, which Buckley helped
define for our time. Beneath Buckley's scintillating
phrases and rapier wit lay, as Churchill wrote of Lord
Birkenhead, "settled and somewhat somber conclusions
upon. questions about which many people are content to
remain in placid suspense": that political and
economic liberty were indivisible; that government's
purpose was protecting those liberties; that the
Constitution empowered government to fulfill its
proper role while restraining it from the
concentration and abuse of power; and that its genius
lay in the Tenth Amendment, which makes explicit that
the powers not delegated to government are reserved to
the states or to the people."

The entire article is linked below (whoever posts
stuff for nation posted it first - John Tab?)

http://www.nypress.com/17/31/news&columns/WilliamBryk.cfm?page=1&last=3

Its a good read, particularly for those who consider
themselves to be politically conservative.

Then I guess I should have invited Tom Cox to speak. He's 
certainly more sympathetic to ravers than any pot-smoking hippie 
congressman I know.

im not sympathetic towards anyone whose goal it is to fuck up 
everyone else's good time. in case you missed it, raving got the 
shaft because people thought it was a good idea to turn them into 
drug sales. if you want to fight to make drug dealing legal so 
that raves can happen again like they were in 1999, good luck with 
that. if instead you want people to be responsible individuals and 
pay the price for letting things get out of hand, you can just not 
worry about this nonsense like i do. i think its moderately 
hilarious how defensive people get about the rave scene when 
people there were doing flagrantly illegal things. i mean, maybe 
we'll see how you feel about some high school punk selling your 15 
year old daughter some designer drug of unknown origin. cops didnt 
let this kind of shit get out of hand, the people throwing the 
raves and making profits from either selling drugs themselves or 
taking a cut of the drugs other people sold there did. why not 
blame them instead of republicans or democrats? 

nah, that would require actual analysis of the situation. its 
better to get some joker ass politician to come to a club. 
riiiiiiight. 

this whole "hey, everybody, lets get into politics!" thing this 
year makes me feel ill. you cant just jump into these kinds of 
things with your opinion already in your head and then expect to 
make anything resembling a sane argument. the reality is that just 
because you get a failed democratic presidential candidate who had 
probably less chance of getting the nomination than al sharpton 
doesnt mean youre doing something "good" for anyone. youre making 
yourself look like a clown.

Subject: {pb-cle} re:john peel

John Peel died last night on October 25, 2004 while on vacation in Peru with 
his wife. He was on holiday when he suffered a fatal heart attack at the age 
of 65.

John Peel is considered legendary for his radio career spanning more than 40 
years and had worked on the BBC Radio 1 since 1967 as a dj and also later on 
Radio 4. John Peel made a huge influence on the whole industry by being 
known to pick independant music and giving underground and obscure artists 
exposure. He was known as one of the very first djs to give exposure to 
punk, hip-hop, and reggae even before they became mainstream.

Gruff Rhys, of the Super Furry Animals, says, "He was very inclusive of all 
kinds of music, very open-minded, and introduced a lot of diverse music to 
the public.

"He championed Welsh language music and for years was the only DJ on 
national radio who was willing to embrace it.

"He was very wary of trends such as Britpop, he was introducing people to 
drum 'n' bass and techno, things that were going on outside of the media."

Andy Parfitt, controller of Radio 1 also said, "John Peel was a broadcasting 
legend. I am deeply saddened by his death, as are all who work at Radio 1"

"John's influence has towered over the development of popular music for 
nearly four decades and his contribution to modern music and music culture 
is immeasurable. Hopeful bands all over the world sent their demo tapes to 
John, knowing that he really cared. His commitment and passion for new music 
only grew stronger over the years.

"In fact, when I last saw him he was engaged in a lively debate with his 
fellow DJs over the state of new music today. He will be hugely missed."

John Peel is survived by his wife Sheila and four children.

Subject: {pb-cle} Halloween Party

This Saturday, Moda will be having a Halloween party with George 
Acosta.

If you're too embarassed to be at a trance party where the music 
is no longer 'relevant,' you can come in costume and hide your 
face so no one will know it was you. I promise it'll be okay. I'll 
even take a break from dancing to hold your drink for you if you 
want to put your hands in the air.

Saturday, October 30

Halloween Bash with George Acosta, Deviant, and Dan Stark

Complimentary drinks for all until midnight
18 to enter, 21 to drink
Ladies free until midnight (Including VIP)

moda nightclub

No one would even know what trance was.  Freaking cleveland and all 
it's house.  Another reason to move to canada if dubya gets reelected.

The biggest difference is the internet.  By far.  If Kerry wins this,
I'm curious if that's 'proof' that organizations like moveon.org work.

actually, i dont even count that for much. i dont see much 
political stuff that im not actually trying to see. OTOH, i get 
like 10 phone calls a day from automated shits trying to tell me 
to vote for their candidate, every single show on television is 
trying to be political, just flipping through channels its 
impossible to land on something that isnt a political show, a 
political ad, or some combination of the two.

"No one would even know what trance was. Freaking cleveland and all it's 
house..."

So Cleveland's all about house, huh? Well as a DJ, that's news to me.  I 
should move to Cleveland.  I'm all about house music.  I'd fit right in.  
House music all night long!!

The Coach says "Shut your ass, and go party!"  Just go to the party and rave, 
man. Have a good time.  Don't be embarrassed that you're at a trance party.  
If people has anything smart to say about it, Fuck'em!  Just pop a few pills 
and let the music control your feelings.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm 
going to Kentucky this weekend to drop some wax with my cowboy hat and square-
dance to house music.  If anyone has anything smart to say, I'm going to shove 
my cowboy boots and the rest of my halloween costume up their asses!

Just try not to bitch and complain so much next week like that one guy was 
earlier today, flooding up the email of everyone on this mailing list about 
how many ravers' diapers he's wiped, and how oakenfold ate a pizza he had 
dropped on the floor at the airport and how he's getting old, like anyone 
gives a rat's ass or anything (just kidding).

If that's news to you, you must not be a very informed dj.  Go to any 
party in northeast ohio and at least 50% of it will be house, more 
like 75% and some parties it's all house.  Hear DnB (or jungle, 
whatever you want to call it) most of the other time and techno or 
goa on rare occasions.  Only time I hear trance is on the rare 
occasion traaaaat spins.  Can't even recall the last time I heard 
hardcore, which makes that NYE party interesting that's going to have 
a lot of hardcore.

Just went to a party in columbus and besides the 40% house, there 
rest were somewhat equal parts of goa, techno and dnb.  More equaled 
out than northeast ohio.  Then went to dayton a while ago and it was 
mainly happy hardcore, freeform stuff.

It's not that I don't like house, in fact I have a few disco house 
records, but I don't want to hear it every time I go out somewhere.

If you're too embarassed to be at a trance party where the music 
is no longer 'relevant,' you can come in costume and hide your 
face so no one will know it was you. I promise it'll be okay. I'll 
even take a break from dancing to hold your drink for you if you 
want to put your hands in the air.

house

  Depends what the rest of it is.  Plus I don't really judge it by 
the dj, since some are over a few different genres what may sound 
like house for one set may sound like techno another time may sound 
like electro another.

I do know people like that, but I'm not.  Pussy trance is usually in 
the 120 range and I love that stuff, but hardly ever hear it.  I 
wouldn't say it's ALL house, but a definate majority is.  I would 
estimate in cleveland/akron area 60-75% of what I hear is what I 
consider house.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

"Deities & Demons Masquerade"
Friday, October 29th 2004 9pm-6am
White Electric Wizard

Join us for a night of costumes, music, & magic.
Come dressed as your true self, archetype, or any thing that you can 
imagine.

In ancient Egyptian "Mer" means Light, "Ka" means Spirit, and "Ba" means 
Body.  Mer-Ka-Ba means the Spirit/Body surrounded by counter-rotating 
fields of Light and is a vehicle to transport one's Spirit/Body from one 
dimension into another.  Using Love and Sacred Geometry, one activates a 
merkaba energy field of Light around the Body, and by doing so, expands 
their consciousness until the physical body is transformed into Light.

The night includes:
Lecture by ALEX GREY:  Deities & Demons, Fear & Ecstasy in the Masks of 
God.

Dance performance with live music.

DJs & Video Projection all night.

Chai-shop and Smart Bar.

11:00 PM BLUETECH LIVE (Aleph Zero, Native:State, Waveform)
Evan Bluetech was classically trained on the piano but found the gateway 
for releasing his musical creation and talent in the electronic music 
scene.  Evan developed his own special blend of musical style.  A style 
which is purely improvisational and lyrical, inspired by the 
possibilities of telling musical stories through tone and rhythmic 
transaction, while constantly drawing inspiration from the different 
evolving electronic musical genres.  It is a package of sounds filled 
with emotion, moods, psychedelia and mystery.   While encompassing 
musical touches from different parts of the globe, it presents a total 
blend, crossing genres and borders.  The outcome is a musical journey 
reaching far away realms that is soothing to your brain and to your 
heart.
  
12:30 AM PEDRO (Reality Engine, N'Light'N, Merkaba - Brasil) When 
playing he searches for what will bring happiness and peace of spirit,

Sat Oct 30                      FUCK THE VOTE                    Pittsburgh

[still on, but POH pulled out, i'm sure theres a party in my pants joke 
to be dropped here]

Pursuit of Happiness has CANCELLED our participation in Fuck the Vote on 
October 30, 2004.

Our events often involve cooperation between members of our own core 
group and others. When differences of opinion exist, we try to 
compromise as much as possible to ensure that everyone is satisfied with 
what we would accomplish. In this case, we came to a simple 
determination that the necessary compromises would fail to accomplish 
our goals, and so we have withdrawn.

Note that there are no hard feelings on our part, and the hard work that 
went into making this event take place is something we respect and we 
will give full support if and when we may be asked to do so. The name of 
the party may change, the line-up we had been prepared to announce may 
change, even the date and venue we intended to use may change, any and 
all details are no longer our decisions to make. It is not our party 
now, it will not be a PoH event.

I am sorry to all of those who were looking forward to this.

-----SHAKE N BREAK-----

Saturday, November 20th, 2004

A weekly event brought to you by S. SIMPSON from DynamixCrew.com
showcasing regional & local talent w/ resident DJ QUARTZ and guests.

Guest Dj for the Night:

DJ KARES -Boston, MA
"fresh off her birthday tour with Dj Baby Anne"

A fresh face in the dance scene, Dj Kares is already enamoring
partygoers across the country as her infectious positive attitude is
projected through her uplifting, crowd-energizing sets.  Her innate
ability to get a dance floor moving stems from her life-long passion for
music, and years spent as a cheerleader by day, then dancing all night
to the tunes of her favorite djs as she worked at several local
nightclubs. Spending most of her club-going career in Boston and New
York City, Kares cites her inspiration for jumping behind the decks as
the likes of dj greats Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren, and Paul Van
Dyk, and credits learning the tricks of the trade from several
dj/producer friends.  Dj Kares has showcased the refreshing style she
has created as predominantly a progressive trance dj (while maintaining
a strong breakbeat influence) at a variety of venues across the US. 
Cities she has played in include Miami, Jackson, Seattle, Portland, San
Diego, Boston, and Memphis.  Kares has also held a monthly residency in
Springfield, MA, and is called upon by magazines such as Glamour to drop
energetic beats for the models at their fashion shows.

Also with Resident Dj:
QUARTZ [DynamixCrew.com]
-droppin some ol skool breaks Baby Anne and Icey style for my girlie, 
Kares!

Promoter:
S. SIMPSON [DynamixCrew.Com]
-this successful promoter has brought to you many slammin parties that
has ripped through the Pgh scene the past 2 years.... He continues to
represent quality entertainment that music lovers desire.

Evolution and Breakline Crew Present... ELEMENTS OF LIFE

FREE GIVEAWAYS BY UFO Clothing!!

Friday, December 10th 2004
Cleveland, Ohio

**IN THIER FIRST EVER PREFORMANCE TOGETHER***
-XAVIER, KOS, AND MC FLIPSIDE (House, Hard House, Live PA)
Xavier and Kos are artists that are one of a kind. When the table is set 
and the crowd is in full force, they drop the high-energy funk that 
crushes dances floors and makes the walls shake. Now with the addition 
of MC Flipsides the party is sure to be hyped!

-Kaos - (Philly - Human Imprint, Habit, Violence, Atlas, Circle, 
Breakline Crew) DnB
Fresh off tour with Dieselboy and a nationally publicized tour sponsored 
by SALEM, Kaos has maintained his status as one of the key figures of 
the Human Imprint label as well as having releases out or slated on 
Violence, Atlas, Renegade Hardware, Habit and Circle, as well as 
remixing tunes for drum and bass greats such as Bad Company. Recently 
featured on the cover of the d'n'b publication Rinse Magazine, Kaos is 
still holding tight as production partner to Dieselboy.

-Annalyze (Rochester, NY - Stanton, Breakline Crew) Breakbeat turntablist
NY's own DJ Annalyze has played all over the US & Canada alongside DJ's 
Baby Anne, Shortee, Q-bert, Rap, Aphrodite, Jackal, Danny the Wildchild 
& much more . She has made appearance at the Winter NAMM show in 2003 & 
2004 and also did spot dates for The VANS Warp Tour in 2002 & 2003. 
Earning a sponsorship by Stanton Magnetics, Anna & her scratch partner 
DJ Shortee form Stantons first female scratch duo "Twice as Nice. 
Anna combines breakbeat and electro with DMC style trickery & is known 
for rocking the crowd!.

-DJ Booth (Louisville, KY  Urban Loops, UFO Jeans, 4-Score) House
Fists in the air: Chaos reigns. For 8 years DJ Booth has dominated the 
midwest, headlining with international acts and struggling for what he 
now holds so dear  an extensive play history of dates nationally and 
internationally, an insurmountable fan base, multiple original 
compositions released nationwide, six mixed CD's, an appointment as a 
promotional rep by the UFO clothing company, and a rockin' remix of "Up 
to You" by Robbie Hardkiss of the famous Hardkiss brothers.

-Rob Riddum (Cleveland  J&N Media) Dnb/Hip-Hop turntablist
One of the key figures of the Element Squad returns to Cleveland. While 
in LA, Rob was working out of the old Beastie Boys studio Grand 
Royale where his main project was www.bradleyhiphop.com. Rob recently 
took home 3rd place at the Salt Lake City DMC. Come see this old skool 
turntablist wreck the decks.

-Kryteria (Curtis R & Patrick Felony  Miami  Breakline Crew) DnB
Playing prestigious events like Ultra Music Festival, Global Gathering, 
and Magical Maydaze has many djs and producers stateside and worldwide 
supporting this dynamic duo by playing their tunes and crowds all over 
are eating them up! With the likes of Karl K and Kaos behind these 
original bad boys none can contest!

-Ewun & Code-D (Rochester, NY  Evol Intent Recordings, Rocdnb, 
Skyehigh, Breakline Crew, La Selva) DnB/Dancehall/Turntablism
Ewun and Code-D are two of NYs most versatile dj's. Known for creative 
mixes and impressive scratch abilities, these two have grown to become 
professionals behind the decks. Code-D has mastered the ability to 
switch styles with ease and his scratching skills are sharp. Ewun has 
just been signed to Evol Intent Recordings, with other releases in the 
works on some of the industries top labels. With DJ support from Evol 
Intent, Tech Itch, Dylan, B-Key, just to name a few, expect to hear a 
lot of noise from this rising artist.

-The Lady Foursquare - (Louisville, KY - UFO Jeans) House
Name another woman who can hold it down right beside Paul Johnson after 
DEMF 2002, tag with Trevor Lamont (Teamsters), share a residency with 
DJs Kit Chaps of VHS or Beta (Astralwerks) and rock the main stage next 
to Terry Mullan, Diego Ro-k and Dieselboy: Foursquare is supporting UFO 
Jeans and her CD, "What Happened?" this fall.

-Jon Doe ( Skratch Fienz / Cleveland) DNB, Hip Hop, Turntablism
Jon Doe is one of the most talented DJ's in Cleveland and yet unknown to 
those outside Cleveland. Jon Doe has been spinning for over 10 years now 
and continues to progress every day. Jon Doe works seven days a week, 
almost twelve hours a day, but he always finds time to get out and play, 
doing what he loves most, blowing ur mind. Talented in so many different 
areas of music Jon Doe is sure to impress!

-Robtronix and MC Barrenzemo (Koala Tea / P3 - DNB & MC) Cleveland
His funky flavor will captivate you within the first second of hearing 
him. Don't let him fool ya by the "i'm a nice boy" smile, like anyone of 
us we have a bad side and he puts that into his music. His thoughts are 
the drums and bass, his voice is the scratch.

-Shagge (Breaks) Cleveland
Shagge is one of the most amazing Breaks DJ's u will ever see...No more 
needs to be said!

-DJ Moose (Break Beat Militia / Breaks, Jump Up Jungle) Cleveland
Moose's unique style sprouts from his hip-hop influence. Blending 
hip-hop with breaks and jungle as well as keeping the crowd entertained 
has been moose's goal and motivation from the start. "All I want to do 
is make the whole crowd bounce, yall!", a sample of Snoop Doggy Dogg in 
a J-Smooth track, is what Moose uses as a slogan for every performance.

ah yeah i forget about things like that. though it makes no sense 
that penn is a swing state, i think the last time we voted for a

Subject: {pb-cle} nice recording util

i haven't messed with it yet, but the on the fly normalization sounds 
cool.  great for those djs who can't be bothered to keep tabs on their 
levels?

"An essential and free tool for recording anything from your
Microphone or Line In inputs which automatically converts to
several digital formats is HarddiskOgg. You can find it at
http://www.fridgesoft.de/harddiskogg.php 
<http://www.fridgesoft.de/harddiskogg.php> The unique advantage
of this program is adjustable "on the fly" normalization. Works
great for recording live or for copying LPs and cassette tapes."

 dance around, do not do
 it! IT IS A SCAM; they only want to see you naked.=20

normilisation is good for some things...like a vocal sample or something
that is mainly in the higher end of the frequency spectrum...but when you
are dealing with drums mainly....proper compression technique plus
normilsation is where its at.

compression is good for shaping individual sounds before the mix.  This can
create more dynamics if the attack is slow or the release is fast (depending
on the sound)

sometimes a little compression on the master insert works good....i like
waves l1, l2, or l3 for this...plus the waves l compressors have dithering
and shaping as part of the plugin...so you are killing 3 or 4 birds with one
stone.

i wouldnt say it adds dynamics at all, thats actually wrong. 
really all youre doing in those cases is letting the natural 
dynamics through. all compressors do is squish low levels and/or 
high levels to the same dynamic peak. then you can gain that up or 
down, depending on how you need it. for example, when compressing 
a kick drum you use the slow attack to let the natural attack 
through, and then the compression kicks in boosting up that later 
part so you can hear the entire decay of the kick drum more 
prominantly. no matter what, youre sucking dynamics out of it for 
the purpose of keeping peaks down or boosting soft parts that you 
want to hear.

I use three separate compressors in my set-up.
Two on drum machines, one on an FX processor.
It allows me to customize the compression settings for each piece of gear, as
they all have different sound output tendencies.

what the hell do you need that many compressors for? theres this 
neat concept, i think you might have heard of it once, its 
called "dynamics". theyre your friend.

but the idea is that when you suck dynamics out of all of your 
individual tracks, you end up with the wall-of-loud-shit effect 
like most modern drum and bass and techno have. heads need to 
relax with the compression and learn to mix down properly, and to 
appreciate dynamics within a song instead of just trying to get 
really loud mixdowns.

Subject: {pb-cle} pot smokers

America Arrests Record Numbers Of Pot Smokers

New data published by the FBI this week has revealed that 755,186 people 
were
arrested for marijuana offences in the US  in 2003, with 88% (660,000) 
busted
for simple possession.

The record number of arrests represented a doubling of pot related arrests 
since
1994 and came soon after the Republican administration urged prosecutors to 
be
particularly merciless with offenders.

"Marijuana and violence are linked," they declared in a memo in 2002, "no 
drug
matches the threat posed by marijuana."

More recently, President Bush ordered police to switch resources from 
targeting
heroin and cocaine to cannabis, suggesting pot arrest figures could 
skyrocket
even further if the Republicans remain in power for four more years. 
Independent
candidate Ralph Nader also highlighted the drugs issue this week in an open
letter to George W, urging him to pardon 30,000 non-violent drug offenders 
at
the end of his first term.

"As someone who has acknowledged having a substance abuse problem you 
understand
the importance of treatment for addiction. I'm sure you also recognize that 
if
you had been incarcerated for cocaine use you probably would not have gone 
on to
have the career you have had," said Mr Nader.

"Therefore, you should be especially sensitive to the need for correcting 
the
injustice of incarceration for non-violent drug offences," he urged.

http://www.votenader.org/media_press/index.php?cid=317 ("The U.S. Department 
of
Justice estimates that if incarceration rates remain unchanged an estimated 
1 of
every 20 Americans and greater than 1 in 4 African Americans can be expected 
to
serve time in prison during their lifetime . . .')

Subject: {pb-cle} basic training



Raving Provides 'Perfect Training' For Soldiers

92 year old Daily Telegraph columnist/ ex editor WF Deedes launched a 
sterling
defence of club culture this week, suggesting staying out all night raving 
could
prove to be excellent training for gallant young officers going off to fight 
in
Iraq.

"As a frequenter of nightclubs in the 1930s, let me take the stand for a
moment," the veteran reveller (who's nowadays a lifetime peer) pleaded.

"The hardest struggle in prolonged conflict is not being brave but staying
awake, and this I found, is where we nightclubbers had the edge over 
fresh-faced
young men, not long out of school and fit as fleas, who after a day and 
night
without sleep, found it hard to keep their eyes open," Lord Deedes recalled.

http://www.sleepfoundation.org/fatigue.cfm ('Recent revelations that the
American pilots who bombed Canadian forces in Afghanistan in April 2002 had
taken amphetamines, or "go pills," came as a surprise to some. However, it 
has
been the Air Force's practice to give small doses of amphetamines to pilots 
on
long flights for years . . .')

Adam Freeland Rejects Raving Bush Girls

Outspoken British breaks star Adam Freeland found himself performing for 
George
W's notoriously fun-loving daughters Jenna and Barb at a US rave last week 
and
told Skrufff he was horrified when he realised who they were.

"I was in Chicago playing a We Want Your Vote gig last Thursday night and 
the
promoter had told me that the Bush daughters might be there and I'd been 
like
'yeah, whatever', said Adam.

"Then about an hour into my set I dropped 'We Want Your Soul', the vibe 
picked
up and a few new heads came onto the floor from the adjacent VIP room, 
including
one pissed up (drunk-slang Ed) girl who was jumping around, pulling hard on 
a
fag (cigarette), who was obviously a party girl," he recalled.


"Then I saw her face and I got this weird deep sickly churning in my 
stomach;
she looked exactly like George W and I realised 'fuck', it is her; George 
W's
daughter going nuts to We Want Your Soul, miming the words," said Adam.

"I felt like I'd seen the antichrist (not that I'm a Christian) but it was
fucking odd and strange and her sister was there with her too, though she 
wasn't
afflicted with looking like him," he continued. "If Bush dressed up as a 
girl,
he'd be his daughter. Poor fucking girl."


"I thought maybe I should go find her chat her up or something (it didn't 
look
like it'd be that tough), try to get her into bed just so I could infiltrate 
her
mind, infiltrate her family, change the world, or even just tell my mates 
I'd
shagged a Bush," Adam added.

"But I didn't," he laughed.

How supremely odd that the vocals for that track are pretty much a damnation of Bush/Blair policy

That's a classic.  What can you say about Bush, huh?  The whole family's 
fucked up.  No wonder why this country's fucked up as it is.  They're 
definately not a normal family. It's a shame.

today i found exactly what i needed for my costume at the redwhite&blue
on 51 + a perfect condition copy of thriller in the front of the vinyl
bins - the day before halloween - that's fairly ridiculous.  mine was
peed on by flood waters last month :/

I always wanted to put a compressor (limiter) on the tv.  I think thats a
great thing to do.  The sound levels on tv change so much you wonder if
there is any kind of standard at all.

that is one really good useage of a compressor, i remember traat 
having that thing on his teevee like years ago at this point. we 
watched MC Hammer lead a congregation in song with little to no 
dynamics. it was the bomb. 

i dont think you would want to hard limit, compression is just the 
ticket for an application like this.

Bin Laden Takes Responsibility for 9/11 Attacks in New Tape
By MARIA NEWMAN

Published: October 29, 2004

    


Osama bin Laden said for the first time that he ordered the attacks of Sept.
11, 2001, according to a videotape made public today, and he accused
President Bush of "misleading the American people'' about the attacks.

He also said that "the reasons to repeat what happened" on 9/11 remain,
according to the Web site of the Al Jazeera satellite news network, which
obtained the tape.

The videotape is the first featuring the Al Qaeda leader to surface in more
than a year, and it comes just four days before the American presidential
elections.

In Washington, F.B.I. officials said they believed that the tape was
genuine, but that they would not comment on it further until they had
conducted further analysis.

The videotape, portions of which were shown on American television, showed
Mr. Bin Laden dressed in white and gold robes and a turban, his long beard
graying.

Reading from papers before him in a nondescript setting, Mr. Bin Laden
mentions both Mr. Bush and his Democratic opponent, Senator John Kerry, and
in a reference to the election on Tuesday, says, according to an translation
by Al Jazeera: "Your security is not in the hands of Kerry or Bush or Al
Qaeda. Your security is in your own hands."

Mr. Bin Laden also said the Bush administration resembled "corrupt" Arab
governments.

"I never thought that the supreme leader would leave 50,000 of his people in
the two towers to face the terrifying events alone at the time they were in
need for him," he said, apparently referring to Mr. Bush and the attack on
the World Trade Center towers.

He accused Mr. Bush of "misleading" the American people four years after the
Sept. 11 attacks, the Al Jazeera Web site said, and added that "we decided
to destroy towers in America," because "we want to regain the freedom of our
nation."

The Associated Press said Mr. Bin Laden also went on to say in the
videotape: "God knows that it had not occurred to our mind to attack the
towers, but after our patience ran out and we saw the injustice and
inflexibility of the American-Israeli alliance toward our people in
Palestine and Lebanon, this came to my mind."

"To the U.S. people, my talk is to you about the best way to avoid another
disaster," The A.P. reported him as saying. "I tell you, security is an
important element of human life and free people do not give up their
security."

He went on to say: "If Bush says we hate freedom, let him tell us why we
didn't attack Sweden, for example. It is known that those who hate freedom
do not have dignified souls, like those of the 19 blessed ones," he said,
referring to the 19 hijackers.

"We fought you because we are free,'' he said, ""and want to regain freedom
for our nation. As you undermine our security, we undermine yours."

In December 2001, the Pentagon made public a videotape in which Mr. bin
Laden was shown at a dinner with associates in Afghanistan on Nov. 9, 2001,
hailing the outcome of the Sept. 11 attacks as exceeding even his
"optimistic" calculations.

But in none of his previous messages, audio or video, did the Qaeda leader
directly state that he had ordered the attacks, which killed some 3,000
people in New York, at the Pentagon and in a hijacked airliner that crashed
in Pennsylvania en route, investigators believe, to strike a target in
Washington, D.C.

was wondering what it was I heard on WNIR that one of the big 
stations obtained a tape yesterday and have contacted the feds to 
verify it's authenticity before airing it.  This is great.  Explain 
this one mr bush-does-no-wrong entropy?   ohh right, sadam had the 
chemicals to make weapons of mass destruction that he shipped out 
days before we invaded them.... right... that's it

damn, now we're going to get political again.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Bin Laden Takes Responsibility for 9/11 Attacks in New Tape 

hmm, maybe that was the tape the guy on the radio was mentioning.  
because he said it was something big.  Compared to bin laden saying 
he did it, this is definitely bigger.  Wonder if this is going to 
jack up the terror level... oooo

Having mixed feelings on what this is going to do to the elections.  
There are a lot of people out there that are voting for bush on the 
sole reason that we're in the middle of "war on terror" which even 
the prez said is never-ending.  so what are all these people going to 
do 4 years from now (if bush gets re-elected, god forbid) when he has 
to leave?

I was waiting some big story to come up around elections.  I was with 
a lot of people thinking they all of a sudden find osama or they do 
something with sadam (we do still have him custody, right??)

Subject: {pb-cle} Tiesto Live on ID&T

So my halloween plans got ruined, I ended up staying home, and figured 
I'd watch the Tiesto webcast. ID&T put it on, it was at the Gelredome 
in Arnhem, Holland (which is one kick ass venue see: Qlimax). I should 
prefix this with that I really hate trance, but I thought I'd watch 
this anyway. I mean, it SHOULD be entertaining, he is "The Number One 
DJ in the World" right? There has to be some redeeming quality in 12 
hours of this performance. (Plus the extra hour for the time change "So 
everyone got home safely")

Well, sorta. Not really, kinda. sorta.

Did anyone else catch this and get just as sick by the camera work done 
by the moth with ADHD?
