Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/

http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Was shut down Wednesday night by the Detroit PD.
For more info and a 4+ hour streaming video of the
event go to http://www.m-nus.com/.
I took a few pictures before it was shut down. The
vibe was getting sicker and sicker until the cops
showed up. Oh well what can you do? I saw quite a
few people drinking in the club after 2am and that
was the reason the cops said they shut the party
down.

They weren't serving after hours there. The problem was nobody pulled drinks
after last call so some people still had there drinks at 3am.

Richie did his set from what i think was a coat check room.  Kind of cool
but it was very hard to get a look at him.

The party was moved to the works, about 8 blocks away.  It went on there
till about 8am.  There were a multitude of reasons why the cops were there
and shut it down.  Any 1 of these reasons probably wouldn't shut it down.

1. People drinking after hours
2. Over capacity (667 is the capacity.  There were about 1000 kids there.)
3. Pyrotechnics cought the ceiling on fire.
4. There was the thanksgiving parade that morning and the cops didn't want a
bunch of cracked out kids hitting the streets with mom and pop and the 2.2
kids.

All in all I had a great time although I need that big fucking system to
recharge my soul.

all the control parties have been at the city club.  Jak the system 2 was at
the city club.  He has used that spot alot. I was surprised to see cops
there.  I was even more suprised to see them shut it down.  Those control
parties make me feel like I'm 18 again.  They are the sickest shit you will
find anywhere.  I've talked to kids that follow him all over the planet and
they say nothing is like seeing him play in detroit.  I'll go again for
sure.

The official capacity of that club is listed at 268.

They host "goth shows" there sometime and=20
are able to double that capacity with no prob.

But 1000?  Wasn't it close to a thousand people???

that's ridiculous.

Wanted to make it, but had to be responsible and worked on final projects... Anybody go? Please tell me Josh didn't drop any pop, like I heard Deep Dish (played Michael Jackson) and Kramer (played Frankie Goes to Hollywood). If so, I'll know Moda's encouraging the sell-out...If anybody would stay true, I'd think Josh Wink would...Reviews, please! Thanks... :-)

I'm gonna have to agree with Tom here...

The pop references you used to convey 'sell-out' are the true pop songs that
arent garbage.... bag on MJ as much as you want for his personal life, but
the dood got it done on his records... i dont really feel his newer stuff,
but the older stuff is the shit.  And to play frankie goes to hollywood
years after it was released just goes to show you that it withstood the test
of time.  Good music may sparkle and fade slightly, but it doesnt fade away
like mmm bop or kris kross.  If they were droppin mixes of 'starry eyed
surprise' or 'without me' then they'd be sellouts, but if they drop the true
quality pop music (read: madonna, prince, michael jackson, etc...) that has
withstood the test of time, they are not selling out, rather they are paying
homage to something that very few artists can create; music that celebrates
life, regardless of what generation is the listening audience.

For real, that is a RETARDED attitude.  I would much rather hear a quality
remix of a good classic track than ANY butt-pumping trancepop or hardhouse
track.   Even current pop has decent remixes, the deep dish DUB of that
Justine Timberlake is truely an awesome remix.  And Miguel Migs did a very
good britney spears dub.


Additionally, amy@headrushmusic.com the domain you use is billing itself as
"subvert the mainstream.  support the underground."  and they are featuring
a remake of song by the police.

go figure.

exactly. i mean, i wish the guy would just give it up and put
himself and us all out of our misery at this point, but his 70's
and 80's stuff is still gold.

it doesnt even have to be a remix. that bushwacka "mix" of billie
jean was hot just because they left the song mostly intact, just
made it better for mixing. the originals of songs are fine to drop
in there as well, you can dance to tracks that dont have a
strictly 909 4 on the floor beat.

hey, in case you didnt notice, the ORIGINAL mix of that track is
fucking hot. ed umm mixed it in with a set of dubby uk garage and
broken beat a couple weeks back and it sounded awesome in there.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Any Reviews of Josh Wink or Michael Myers?


>Wanted to make it, but had to be responsible and worked on final
projects... Anybody go? Please tell me Josh didn't drop any pop, like I
heard Deep Dish (played Michael Jackson) and Kramer (played Frankie Goes
to Hollywood). If so, I'll know Moda's encouraging the sell-out...If
anybody would stay true, I'd think Josh Wink would...Reviews, please!
Thanks... :-)

***
the last time we had josh in for clockwork, homeboy dropped at least 30
minutes of straight up popular hip hop, not old school, not nu school,
just straight up made for radio hip hop...

...and in reference to the artists you mentioned, each one has played
such a major role in influencing and developing music that I suggest you
do a lil homework before you start up with that tired old raver-ass sell
out bullshit!!!

Hi All--

This is "trinity" -- I just changed my addy a week or so ago...

We're getting new tables and are selling the old ones if anyone's looking for a couple of "stocking stuffers" for the holidays or that third table for some Cox-style fun. (And I don't mean Tom). 

Send me a private message if you're interested.

dear friends and family of the pb-cle list

       I went to Pressure at the Bottom Line in the flats.  I was all excited 
to go to this drum & bass night.  The back of the flyer says $3 for the 
brothas and free for the sistas.  well that is BULL SHIT! I get there and 
they tried to charge my girlfriend and 2 of her freinds 5 bucks to get in. 
Well they bitched and got in for free like the flyer said.  So then i get 
there and they charged me 5 dollars to get in. I bithched too untill the 
bouncer came and told me that "I pay 5 dollars or i leave". Of course every 
one else is already in the club and so I paid to get in. oh yeah and they 
also charged 5 if you were 21.  So ok, i was not going to let that ruin my 
night.  This place is so small on the .The dance floor is like12'x12'.  like 
enough room for 4 people to dance, but thats ok because we were the only ones 
dancing.  A friend that we were with set her jacket down on the bench next to 
where we were dancing and this shady ass girl walked up and stole it.  i 
wached her do it and i told my freind.  so my friend goes up and asks her and 
she told her that she did not have it.  this jacket had her keys and id ( she 
is from Wisconsin so its almost imposible for her to get another id).  she 
goes and tells one of the bouncers.  the dude walked over and looked in this 
girls purse and sure as shit there was the jacket.  the club did nothing 
more.  they did not even try and kick the girl out.  come to find out that 
she's one of the dj's girls.  the club totally condoned her behavior.  as for 
me, i will never go to this night again, i do not need to pay to get in 
somewhere that is screwing me on the price to get in and is saying its two 
dollors more then the flyer thats sitting right next to the lady taking the 
money.  i am asking every one on the list to band together and boycot this 
club  if enough of us don't go then the night will go anywhere and we won't 
let shady take advantege of us.  i have been in the scene for a long time and 
i have heard that our scene sucks and is dead.  well i think thats bull shit! 
we need to band together and show the fellas that run this clubnight that we 
are a strong scene and we the people of it run it... not some shady people 
that wanna take your money and condone theft.

thank you and sincerly yours,
Ryan K.

Theres good pop and bad pop...

I turn on the radio every once in a while and I never hear anything I 
like...if something I do like comes along, the repetition kills it...

Am I going to like any of this new shit any better when it becomes old shit?

hmmmm

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} FWD: Big Big up the Pittsburgh Crew

here's a review of one great friday night in pittsburgh that just 
about none of you experienced any of, i know cause i didnt see you 
there. shit was hot, and some dope producers with a dope label 
from chicago had a night of underground fun. it was dope, about 12 
hours straight of 2-step/broken beat/dancehall madness.

respect Ed Um, Thomas "Dont Call Me DJ Tom" Cox, 
Eric H, TS Heritage, and MC Bubbles for a rocking good 
time in the steel city. 

The crowd at the Warhol was ecclectic - everything 
from grey haired ladies to dreads - and the vibe was
positive, especially when Bubbles was on the mic with
Toby- excellent combination. And if you're ever in 
Pittsburgh on a Friday night, check Bubbles' dancehall 
night at Wiskey Dick's.  he was mixing, toasting, running 
lights, playing samples... a real treat to behold. 

The highlight was a latenight tagteam session with Eric H, 
TS Heritage and myself at a  crazy 
underground club that defies Pittsburgh's weird afterhours
laws.  we threw down many a 4/4 track, whilst the girls were
twisting the waist till 5am.  

hella fun.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} !!!!!!!!pressure was allright!!!!!!!!

it wasn't really that bad, I never got charged $5, but you're a biatch 
for crying over two bucks anyway. the DJs droped some sick beats, the 
b-boys were on point all night. the $1 drafts were great. I do have a 
complaint about the MC, but since nobody was gonna step up and take the 
mike away from him I can hardly talk.

anyway..., the party was kickin, lots of people, food being served. It 
was sweet

control was ok, (which btw, that was the 3rd
demf)there were WAY too many people there and in my
opinion the vibe just S-U-C-K-E-D..that tainted it for
me and i didnt have any reason to return to the others
in the series, but i would imagine that they were
better than the demf deal.

jak (demf01) was brilliant, perfect, and exactly what
i wanted as far as a hawtin gig..underpromoted, not a
big crowd and just perfect..

other plus8 gigs i have been to were nothing short of
amazing but control was a total dissapointment to me.
id like to think this past party was rockin, sven vath
would be tight, and that new release of theirs is
good..but i dont know..its definitly not the
same..(but is it ever?)

im happy with the memories of what i have from that
particular detroit/windsor posse..but things have
changed.

one party a year is better than 4. 
but 4 makes way more money than 1.
duh

the only constant is change.  Just a side note the jak party was during the
second demf.  Richie played the actually demf the first year so he didin't
have a show after words.  Control 2 was during the third demf and control 3
and 4 fell on non demf days.  I don't remember when control1 was I wasn't
there.

hey, I unsubscribed while on vacation and now I think its been rather
refreshing to have normal volumes of email each day :) So while I still
have post access (read: spam about events I'm throwing and cds/mixes) I
won't be present for any of the discussions here .. which is probably a
good thing, my attitude hasn't been too hot lately :)

you know where to reach me, and ill be back (everyone comes back). peace,

I love the fact that my original request was for reviews of their performances on 11/30, and I got everything BUT a review.

Josh Wink is probably one of the most diverse guys in terms of history and what he'll drop. My question was directed at those who attended in order to ascertain what exactly he DID play. I and others who have been to MODA have wondered if management there has dropped suggestions to DJ's to play on the lighter side. Coincidentally or not, the times I've heard pop-like tracks dropped there was at "last call" time - 2am. What a better way to get folks off the dance floor and to the bar? DJ's such as Deep Dish that I have seen on several other occasions in different cities have never played anything remotely Top 40 in the sets that I've been at. Hence I was really, really surprised when I heard what I heard both at Deep Dish and Kramer. If it were Oakenfold, then maybe I wouldn't have been surprised. (He's still ending his sets with U2's "Streets Have No Name.") But I wasn't expecting it from those two. If Josh Wink played super-mainstream, I was going to wonder again if it was by request of the venue. He's got a diverse enough repertoire that if he did play exclusively music more on the pop side, I'd wonder if it was by request.

I'm not denying the contributions of some pop artists like Michael Jackson to the dance music genre. "Frankie Goes to Hollywood" were some of the first 12" I bought. Frankie's "this is a 12-inch" track lay a foundation for many people to understand the elements and construction of how dance music is made.

What I'm at issue with is the grandeur with which MODA promotes cutting-edge DJ's and music, the more costly cover charges than other Cleveland venues, the proclamation that "It's All About the Music..." They build an expectation that I'm about to experience something familiar that I find at Vinyl or CentroFly in New York City, or at Crobar, Exile, or Space in Miami, and yet I was hearing tracks that I could have heard right alongside "C'Mon Eileen" at any standard-issue club in the Flats. I totally want to support MODA. I want people here who have never been to Space or Twilo to understand how intense the experiences at great clubs are with DJ's who are willing to take musical risks can be, and with audiences who are willing to be taken to unknown territory. But I don't hear a whole lot of risk or willingness to try new things in playing leftovers from the 1980's.

I wasn't there or anything, but I've seen Josh Wink within the past year
play at a rave (the easiest place to play "innovative" music), and his set
was boring as all hell.  He certainly didnt play anything pop-py at all, he
just played a bunch of lousy "tech-house" garbage that had no rhyme or
reason, or MUSIC even, in it.  Just "um-sih, um-sih, um-sih, um-sih, um-sih,
um-sih, um-sih, um-sih" for 2 hours.  I was like "So why does this guy get a
zillion dollars to play again?"

I definetly would have much rather heard a pop-py set than that!  I'll take
Daft Punk over Justin Berkovi any day of the week.  I don't care about
loaded words that people like to give to music to sell crappy music, like
"innovative", there is just simply nothing redeeming about hearing the same
4/4 beat and a little wanky sound for 2 hours.

Hey, I'm sorry that I jumped off the handle at you... I was in a bad mood
last night.

I'm quite sure that Moda is not dropping "hints" about what to play to any
of its guest DJs.  It just so happens that the 80's are in, and dropping
80's tracks in sets is going to happen everywhere for a while.  The whole
electroclash influence and all.   I can go into this fully, but I don't have
the time right now.

>From my standpoint, in the cleveland clubs right now the crowd that is going
out is in a very weird state of evolution.  I have my theories on why as
well.   Any professional dj carries "get out of jail" records in his box...
and I have a feeling that maybe you heard these tracks because of an
unresponsive crowd.

Maybe I'll go into more of it later.

wondered if management there has dropped suggestions to DJ's to play on the

off the dance floor and to the bar? DJ's such as Deep Dish that I have seen
on several other occasions in different cities have never played anything
remotely Top 40 in the sets that I've been at. Hence I was really, really
surprised when I heard what I heard both at Deep Dish and Kramer. If it were
Oakenfold, then maybe I wouldn't have been surprised. (He's still ending his
sets with U2's "Streets Have No Name.") But I wasn't expecting it from those
two. If Josh Wink played super-mainstream, I was going to wonder again if it
was by request of the venue. He's got a diverse enough repertoire that if he
did play exclusively music more on the pop side, I'd wonder if it was by

No one is saying that Michael Jackson and Frankie Goes To Hollywood
didn't produce quality work that had an important influence on dance
music.  However, in the context of the evening/nightclub, and given the
kind of music that I have heard Deep Dish and Kramer play in the past,
it was quite obvious that they were pandering to the crowd when they
dropped those '80s remixes.  Perhaps if those particular remixes that
were played weren't so overtly cheesy, it wouldn't have been as
disconcerting to hear from such underground artists.  

As you are all aware, one of the factors that makes certain DJs stand
out from others is the quality and cohesiveness of the overall set, not
just the quality of particular tracks.  It was obvious that the
mainstreamish Moda crowd was not getting into the more underground stuff
that we are accustomed to, and Deep Dish and Kramer played to the crowd.
I'm not saying that DJs are supposed to ignore the desires of the
audience in favor of shoving their own preferences down the audience's
throat; however, I would not have expected such a jarring U-turn by DJs
who are known for pushing future music rather than golden oldies.  The
atmosphere/vibe was instantly transformed from brilliant music education
to '80s night at Polly Esther's.

As for my remix of a Police track (which was originally remixed by KC
Flightt), I would consider that to be a far cry from a wholesale remix
of an entire '80s track.  It's like saying that MC Lyte's "Poor Georgie"
was a remake of Diana Ross' "My World Is Empty Without You," rather than
just sampling a small piece of that track.  It's not as if I used the
vocals from the entire "Voices" track.  In fact, I included vocals from
a variety of sources--was I doing a remake of all of those tracks, as
well?  

Aside from all this, I am happy to join the excellent music scene here
in Cleveland.  I've heard a lot of the great local DJs play already, and
I am excited about the enthusiasm of the music fans out here.  I hope to
meet a lot of you when I play at Abbasso with DJ Darbe this Saturday.
Amy and I are working on bringing some great DJs to Cleveland, like
Trendroid and John Howard.  Stay tuned for updates, and we'll have the
Cleveland version of HeadRushMusic.com up soon.

Peace,

Subject: {pb-cle} Feast (and then some)

I had a great time in Cleveland - Doug, you're really something. From the
dinner to the club, it was one of the best and most cohesive evenings I've
had in a long time, and it was so nice to visit with some of the people I
haven't seen in as much as a year. I won't get into a listing here, but the
people of Northeast Ohio really have something special going on. Here on the
opposite corner of the state I'm having a really hard time enjoying myself,
and I hope some day to be able to come back up there.

It's too bad that our "netmeet" was a wash, but oh well...

And then I ate too much, and slept too much, and that's what I call a really
good time. My parents have a wood-burning fireplace now so I just sat in
front of that for two days. Gotta get me one of them...

Howdy-doo from Hamiltucky,

>Josh Wink is probably one of the most diverse guys in terms of

yes, and then you referred to playing pop tracks as being a bad
thing. which is why everyone got irritated. 

>Coincidentally or not, the times I've heard pop-like tracks
dropped there was at "last call" time - 2am. What a better way to
get folks off the dance floor and to the bar? 

huh? its funny you should say that, because from what ive
experienced, playing a pop track is guaranteed to get MORE people
on the dance floor instead of less. people like to hear things
they recognise. 

>DJ's such as Deep Dish that I have seen on several other
occasions in different cities have never played anything remotely
Top 40 in the sets that I've been at.

thats funny considering the fact that they have a grammy for
remixing a pop track. i certainly wouldnt ever consider deep dish
"above" playing pop tracks. 

> If it were Oakenfold, then maybe I wouldn't have been surprised.
(He's still ending his sets with U2's "Streets Have No Name.") But
I wasn't expecting it from those two. If Josh Wink played
super-mainstream, I was going to wonder again if it was by request
of the venue. He's got a diverse enough repertoire that if he did
play exclusively music more on the pop side, I'd wonder if it was
by request.

why is this about someone being "mainstream" or not having
anything to do with playing a pop record? where is your logic
here? ive heard some underground motherfuckers play pop records in
deejayed sets. youre making these senseless generalizations that
arent based in anything resembling reality. i know more than a few
deejays (myself included) who dont leave the house with a record
bag/box without "blue monday" in it. 

>I'm not denying the contributions of some pop artists like
Michael Jackson to the dance music genre. "Frankie Goes to
Hollywood" were some of the first 12" I bought. Frankie's "this is
a 12-inch" track lay a foundation for many people to understand

did it? thats funny, i guess those dance records made the 50 years
before that didnt do anything like that. good dance music is good
dance music, no matter when its from or who its by. 

>What I'm at issue with is the grandeur with which MODA promotes
cutting-edge DJ's and music, the more costly cover charges than

then shouldnt all the deejays play the BEST music? wouldnt that
make sense? if youre going to try and tell me that some craptastic
prog house track is better than a michael jackson song, we're
going to have a fistfight. 

>They build an expectation that I'm about to experience something

i dont know shit about centro-fly since ive never been there, but
i do know that there is a UK garage night there pretty frequently
(run by goldspot productions) and i know that there's some pop
remixes being played there for damn sure.

im going to excuse you for being dumb. playing progressive house
is NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT "taking a musical
risk". if you think that, you need to have someone finish your
botched lobotomy. if anything the shit played at space and twilo
is the cheapest crap dance music made. its not progressive or
whatever cracker adjective you want to stick on there to make
yourself feel cool for listening to crap music. real progression
for clubs like that would be to start playing GOOD music, and
michael jackson is as good a start as any.

i dont even think that its the influence of electroclash, i think
that electroclash is more of a symptom of the 80's revival, its
just the most ridiculous example. the 80s thing is everywhere,
look at the meshbacked hat revival, Pony is making shoes again,
air jordans are selling for thousands on ebay, etc. and thats all

i dont necessarily think of them as a "get out of jail free"
record, though they can be used that way. ive seen pop records
used to help build sets quite effectively before. having a great
record that everyone knows in your record box isnt a bad thing,
and like i said most deejays i know are armed with at least one or
two "classics" in addition to newer jams.

HOW ARE DEEP DISH UNDERGROUND? underground artists dont win
grammys for remixing pop tunes. shit, id say that for the most
part, if theyre booked to play Moda then theyre NOT underground
right off the bat. and what exactly is wrong with "pandering to
the crowd"? i mean, a deejay should never ever play a song they
dont like just because the crowd wants to hear it. but if micheal
jackson is so bad, then why the fuck was the record in their box
in the first place? i thought the goal of being a deejay was to
make people dance? if thats one of your weapons in the battle to
do that, good for you. make it work.

again, prog house is referred to as "underground". i must be
missing something.

have you ever heard the old saying "take a step back in order to

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} !!!!!!!!pressure was allright!!!!!!!!

I had a good time myself.  I was only charged the three bucks at the door 
and no more. The dollar drafts were off the hook, we wont talk about that 
cause some of you are begining to think I'm a lush..The music was great when 
the sound wasnt cutting off. As to your jacket being stolen I can only say 
this.  No matter where you go there is shady people, you should know by now 
not to leave anything valuable laying about.  As to the MC he tried to MC 
for Dara at Rebirth, it lasted about 5 minutes.  As to quote Dara later that 
night "Any MC who tries to flow over a vocal track is a fucking idiot".

While I appreciate your crusade to defend pop music, which certainly has its 
place, placing a value judgment on a genre simply makes you sound like 
dualist. This = good. That = bad. To me, that's just another example of 
insufficient options.

reFLEXively?

I flex.

Weren' you the one with the "no good or bad music" mantra?

Wheres the table?

Want to arm wrestle?

Actually, my opinion about what I enjoy means nothing to the Tom 
Commandments (see: Ten Commandments. IE: GOD)

I only buy progressive house records because I'm white.

If my father was black all I would buy would be New Order, Shawn Rudiman, 
and twenty thousand copies of Dance of the Global Tribes by Jaguar.

Oh wait fuck, those are all white guys! (Except for the mexican Jaguar guy)

Those poseurs.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} I was at josh wink...

his set wasn't mind-blowing, but had some interesting turns in which you
wouldn't expect during a club night...

I picked him up, and all he had was his dad (which was weird) and final
scratch with 900 albums.  No sign of him even knowing what the club was
about, let alone him being told what to play.  His set started with a new
radiohead remix, and did the "joshwink" house kinda thing, played some
industrial, and headhunter, which is always a pleasure.   And in that club,
I am very surprised it went over well.

he doesn't have the spunk like in the days, but he's chill now, him and his
dad I guess go globe trotting, and be playboys (the whole family is doctors
BTW, which I found funny)

again, musically, he worked free of constraint, but lacked the artisticness
that he once had.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: Any Reviews of Josh Wink or Michael Myers?

Exactly what is so bad about the 80s . . . ???  I find this disturbing that 
80s music is simply being played because it is "IN", rather then recognizing 
the important roots of electronic music that stem from the 80s.  A good, 
original mix of an 80s tune is always a good thing, not overkill of the 80s 
like can happen, but can be an unexpected surprise.

I'm aware.  I've got lots of music both pre and

fucking great.  There's just no eye candy.  But that's
why Paul and I are going.  We're providing a service

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Sneaker Pimps (just wondering)

like i said...i just felt like being a dick

:)

the sneaker pimps are actually quite good in my humble cracker
opinion...even though lots of hiphop fans will tell you that trip hop was a
media invented genre and all that...british production is and was and
probably willl always be ahead of its time...the sneaker pimps are one of
those groups that prove this well...

Subject: {pb-cle} new radio show: 1 hour mix on monday nights . . .

for any of you cleveland heads that are out and about monday nights from 
11pm-12am, check out 88.7fm (WJCU- john carroll) for a new mix show.  i 
definitely welcome any critiques and comments;i am hoping i get listeners 
who can give me some solid advice.

in case you're wondering about format, for the most part it will be stuff a 
la jazzy breaks (ninjatune/mowax/etc.).  it'd definitely not genre specific 
though, who knows what'll get tossed on.

anyways, pass this on to anybody you feel would be interested, and i hope 
some of you tune in!

dan.

A crutch?  Sorry--I was hired to do the remix, I wasn't looking for a
crutch.  I'd be happy to send you a CD with the other stuff that I have
coming out if you'd like to provide me with a balanced, informed opinion
of my work.  Just send me over your address or come out to Abbasso this
Saturday.

It's easy to talk trash behind an e-mail address or screen name.  Would
you really be saying this stuff to me in person?  You don't even know
me.  Why do you want to start a fight with me?  Are you just the
resident troll of pb-cle?

When you're done hazing the "new guy," just let me know so we can move
on to more interesting discussions.

Doug, I can't wait to hear your opinion on the electro-pop issue. I'm finding it hard to believe that Tom is representing the opinions of most people.

RE The music in question: All I know is that I was listening to it as most average jr. high kids growing up near Akron, and it replaced my parents' Motown records and my disco records as my favorites. New stuff to dance to at slumber parties! I then heard it on the top 40 radio shows, then saw videos for it on Friday nights at 11pm ("Friday Night Videos" --before MTV-- Will you ever forget the Premier of "Thriller?!"), I heard it at my high school dances, went to college, heard it at frat parties there, got old enough to drink at 19, heard it in the bars then, graduated, started working, went downtown, heard it in "retro" clubs there, got promotions, moved to live in miami and to new york city, traveled to LA, DC, chicago, toronto, got my mind BLOWN by all the music I'd never heard at a rave or club in Akron or Cleveland and spent a full three years not having to listen to one goddam "retro" song that I ended up hearing at cousins' weddings anyway, moved back here and it's like time stopped. I go out and I'm hearing the same stuff I used to dance around my living room with my girlfriends at 6th-grade sleepovers or used to see girls standing around in a circle dancing to at the high school gym during Homecoming. Yeah, I'm 33, and I realize things go in cycles, but folks -- come on... Did this stuff ever really leave long enough to come back as a trend? There's being comfortable with something recognizable, then there's a time to wean and let go of the damn security blanket. "Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver and the other, gold." If music of the past was always just good enough because it was "good music" and anything new was "bad music," we'd all still be running around singing Gregorian chants waiting for the Renaissance. (oops. I'm sorry. I made a reference to a progressive house label.)

this one is a little (okay, alot) long, but its worth it i think, 
read it, argue with me more.

>While I appreciate your crusade to defend pop music, which 
certainly has its

like

example of 
>insufficient options.

i am in no way defending ALL pop music. however, i am certainly 
writing off all prog house, and all trance. along with modern 
country, modern jungle, and smooth jazz, i find these to be the 
most worthless musical genres, ones with not even one tune to 
stand up in greatness and timlessness to one of michael jackson's 
older tracks. it really takes alot for me to write off entire 
genres, generally theyre guilty of being in existence due to one 
thing: the commercialization and/or whitening of a good genre of 
music, which each of those genres ive written off is definitely 
guilty of. and yes, there is only good and bad music. 

since im bored, ill get a little technical with my theorey....

good music MUST contain one or more of these qualities:

it conveys feeling/emotion
it is timeless
it is brilliantly composed/arranged/produced

for example, a tune that accomplishes all of those is jimi 
hendrix's version of bob dylan's "all along the watchtower". the 
emotion is all through jimi's playing. it doesnt sound outdated 
even today. dylan's songwriting combined with jimi's arrangement 
was stupendous: even bob dylan has played it jimi's way since he 
first heard it. 

a track that is timeless is ye olde "greensleeves". shit is mad 
old, still sounds hot. 

a track that conveys emotion is "sleepwalk" by santo and johnny. 
it just drips with an otherworldly emotional vision, despite being 
made in 1950 with common instruments. 

a brilliantly composed song is "i want it that way", popularized 
by the backstreet boys. this is a perfect example of a great song 
not being able to be ruined even by the most inept and clueless 
performers. other versions of this song show even more than the 
BSB version exactly how great that song is. 

now in order for music to be bad, it has to fall into one or more 
of these categories:

it is made purely for commercial purposes
it expresses false/no emotions
it is derivative of some other music, while removing the essential 
parts in order to make it more commercially viable

a great example of all 3 is Muzak. they take out the emotion of 
good music, make it as inoffensive as possible, and use it to sell 
products to you in a shopping environment. 

an example of the first category is any commercial jingle: as 
catchy as the melodies may be, a commercial tune can never be good 
music. theme songs from films and television shows, however, are 
(sometimes) meant as artistic expressions despite their use in 
selling the movie/tv show. so they can be good music. 

an example of the second is any cheesy pop punk tune, sung by 
white suburban rich kids talking about how hard their lives are 
because they dont have an SUV or whatever. i mean you can turn on 
the radio and hear these fuckers whining any given moment. more 
music in this category includes eminem, korn (after their first 
record), etc. 

an example of the second is elvis presley, the rolling stones, 
prog house, new country, etc. things that have watered down 
actually good forms of music into easily consumable, non-
challenging crapola. 

let me just point out here the originality means NOTHING when 
deciding if music is good or bad. plenty of "groundbreaking" music 
is horrible, but it is somewhat necessary. experiementation is 
good, but the results are not guaranteed to be good. most often 
the result is bad music. but that doesnt mean that you should 
overlook experimental music. something can always be taken from 
it, and used in some other way to make good music better. 

to get further into some more difficult classifications, lets look 
at brian eno. the guy's ambient music is meant specifically to be 
ignored. when defining the music, he said it is meant to be 
background music. it is not time specific, but it is not timeless 
either, exactly. however, it is absolutely brilliant in concept, 
and that concept is timeless. thats enough to make it good music.  
something like richie hawtin's live performances, despite the fact 
that they are largely concept based, are not good music. they use 
lots of ideas to create something that is in no way special, 
timeless, or interesting. its a little derivative of people like 
steve reich, brian eno, phillip glass, etc, but applied to techno 
in the least innovative way possile: the music still essentially 
sounds the same without his concept as it does with it. 

now lets examine king tubby. this is a perfect example of a person 
who was innovative, timeless, and still commercially viable. 
however, he would be relegated to the "bad for the sake of 
experimentalism" heap if it werent for the fact that the music he 
performed his groundbreaking bass-and-drums surgery on WAS ALL 
EXCELLENT. the studio 1 reggae at the time was off the hook, 
dubbed or not. 

now i want to talk about white emcees. i generally dont like white 
emcees because they fall into the white emcee trap: they either 
end up sounding like a parody of black emcees, or they trivialize 
themselves and poke fun at everything to the point where they are 
a comedy act. eminem really pisses me off because the guy has 
flows to crush so many other emcees, but he gets into the white 
guy thing by wasting time ripping on christina aguilera, nsync, 
and moby in order to draw attention to himself. no good emcee 
would need to do that. that is some seriously weak shit. if he can 
clean that up, i think he has a chance to be a great emcee. 
however, if he does do that, the pop culture interest in him will 
plummet, so dont expect it to happen any time soon. however the 
Streets (aka mike skinner), a white as all hell "rapper" (from the 
UK nonetheless!) manages to go about being witty, talking about 
his real life, and bending and breaking the conventional rules of 
hiphop to make the first great album by a white emcee since the 
beastie boys' "ill communication". 

and finally, a quick look at proghouse/trance. these are genres 
that have undeniably splintered off of dance music like 
disco/garage/house and techno. the originators of these styles of 
music were mostly black, and in some cases gay as well. despite 
the overwhelming opinion that the originators of these styles were 
brilliant, their records dont sell as well as their white 
counterparts. why? racism/homophobia in the fans? in the industry? 
in the media? probably a little of all of those. but the point 
remains that the genres of proghouse and trance have very very 
very few famous black performers/producers (i cant even think of 
one off the top of my head, though im sure there are SOME) whereas 
the music theyre derivative of has a much more ethnically diverse 
set of people behind it. but its the prog/trance guys who get put 
on the covers of magazines and get called "superstar deejays" and 
all that bullshit. why? because they sell better. NOT because they 
make good music. and since the entire basis of a genre is the fact 
that it sells better than the "ethnic" techno it rips off means 
that it cant contain any good music. so there.

your opinion matters not: you enjoy what you enjoy and you hate

you "enjoy" listening to good or bad music has nothing to do with 
anything. i listen to some bad music, for sure. im not going to go

good "because i like it". thats fucking dumb. thats like saying 
murder is good because you like it. you liking it isnt going to 
make it become good, it is bad.

are you talking about "knights of the jaguar" by rolando? 

anyway, nowhere did i say that white people didnt make good music. 
i have plenty of music made by white people that is totally 
excellent. however, they didnt make it by whitening good music 
that was originally made by black people, like proghouse does. 
shawn and new order are perfect examples of great music made by 
white people.

no hazing here bud, this type of response from me is de rigueur 
for some people who have been on this list for ages when they 
start saying dumb shit. and i think that the discussion of the 
restraining nature of a "progressive" taste in music on the 
overall direction of the music scene is a fun one indeed. im sorry 
if this isnt stimulating enough for your progressive nature.

I'm finding it hard to believe that Tom is representing the

ah yes, we all know the value of the word of the masses, who can 
be confused into voting for a republican administration. im all 
for the voice of the masses meaning EVERYTHING, but when the voice 
is clouded by the perceptions forced upon them by the media, it 
becomes meaningless. and thats whats happening with 
this "progressive" idea you keep talking about. 

please, while we're talking about this, explain what 
makes "progressive" house so progressive. by my estimation, since 
i first heard it, its progressed exactly one place: nowhere. 

>RE The music in question: All I know is that I was listening to

replaced my parents' Motown records and my disco records as my

well hey, if your concept of the meaning of music hasnt evolved 
since you were in jr high school, i think we might be stumbling 
upon the real reason you listen to bad music. did it not ever 
occur to you that your juvenile interpretations of michael jackson 
are not entirely holistic? im sorry if youre caught in some web of 
shame of what you listened to as a child. i know im not too 
embarassed about what i rocked. 

>I then heard it on the top 40 radio shows, then saw videos for it 
on Friday nights at 11pm ("Friday Night Videos" --before MTV-- 
Will you ever forget the Premier of "Thriller?!"), I heard it at 
my high school dances, went to college, heard it at frat parties 
there, got old enough to drink at 19, heard it in the bars then, 
graduated, started working, went downtown, heard it in "retro" 
clubs there, got promotions, moved to live in miami and to new 
york city, traveled to LA, DC, chicago, toronto, got my mind BLOWN 
by all the music I'd never heard at a rave or club in Akron or 
Cleveland and spent a full three years not having to listen to one 
goddam "retro" song that I ended up hearing at cousins' weddings 
anyway, moved back here and it's like time stopped. 

yes, isnt it interesting being in the real world where "flavor of 
the month" trendiness doesnt rule all? i know im personally glad 
to have lots of music around me that is not disposable. trendiness 
is another method of promoting consumerism. if youre down to be a 
lifelong consumer who DEMANDS to be able to purchase new 
disposable music, thats pretty dumb. 

>I go out and I'm hearing the same stuff I used to dance around my 
living room with my girlfriends at 6th-grade sleepovers or used to 
see girls standing around in a circle dancing to at the high 
school gym during Homecoming. Yeah, I'm 33, and I realize things 
go in cycles, but folks -- come on... Did this stuff ever really 
leave long enough to come back as a trend? 

its funny, since ive associated the late 70's and early to mid 80s 
with techno and dance music as long as ive known about them. if 
everything is just a trend to you, it doesnt mean that it is for 
everyone else. my music that i listened to at older points in my 
life still means alot to me, and it means alot to most people. to 
be honest, i think that 99.9% of people who drive to 
be "new" "different" or "progressive" are just full of shit, and 
are just looking for something to fill up some void they have in 
life that is keeping them from being satisfied with what they have 
done with themselves. 

>There's being comfortable with something recognizable, then 
there's a time to wean and let go of the damn security 
blanket. "Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver and 
the other, gold." If music of the past was always just good enough 
because it was "good music" and anything new was "bad music," we'd 
all still be running around singing Gregorian chants waiting for 
the Renaissance. (oops. I'm sorry. I made a reference to a 
progressive house label.)

you dont listen to classical music then, eh? or what about 
traditional african music? or old acid jazz? if you dont like 
hearing old music that is still good and relevent, i really dont 
know what to say. good music doesnt die. it ages well and is not 
a "security blanket". just because something is new doesnt mean 
that it is any better than what came before it. check your 
thesaurus, Different/=Good.

reFLEXively?

I flex.

Weren' you the one with the "no good or bad music" mantra?

Wheres the table?

Want to arm wrestle?

Actually, my opinion about what I enjoy means nothing to the Tom 
Commandments (see: Ten Commandments. IE: GOD)

I only buy progressive house records because I'm white.

If my father was black all I would buy would be New Order, Shawn Rudiman, 
and twenty thousand copies of Dance of the Global Tribes by Jaguar.

Oh wait fuck, those are all white guys! (Except for the mexican Jaguar guy)

Those poseurs.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Interesting mail, I enjoyed reading it.

You've certainly discarded the dualist mantra, however, Tom, you must be 
keenly aware of how your argument is relativist, without stating that fact 
explicitly.

Instead of the this = good, that = bad, of which I supposed you were the 
champion in your previous mail, this is more a this = good to me, that = bad 
to me. This argument has its merits, no doubt, but I still feel it is 
presumptuous to state that good music elicits emotional responses without 
stating the relativist "to me."

For example, it is reasonable to consider a 14-year-old Minnesota teenie 
bopper feels Christina's "Genie in a Bottle" truly captures her mindset and 
illuminates very real emotional responses - to her. Is it right to say her 
experience is any less real at any time, simply because it cannot be 
generalized? I would accept a gradiation argument in this case, that, good 
music elicits these responses over a greater number of people, or ethnic 
groups, etc, but that is not what you stated.

As for timelessness, such is relativist as well. For the next fifty years, 
teenie boppers might one after another rediscover Christina's ballad and 
have similar feelings evoked. There experience, therefore, falls under your 
description of good music. In fact, with your definition, it would be hard 
pressed to find many songs that do not constitute good music.

I agree with you on the whole, Tom, however, you must, if trying to be 
educational, consider the pitfalls of relativism. There are few greater 
crimes than trivializing the experiences of others according to external 
validity measures.

Dippyness.

>>
>>since im bored, ill get a little technical with my theorey....
>>
>>good music MUST contain one or more of these qualities:
>>
>>it conveys feeling/emotion
>>it is timeless
>>it is brilliantly composed/arranged/produced
>>
>>for example, a tune that accomplishes all of those is jimi

>>emotion is all through jimi's playing. it doesnt sound outdated
>>even today. dylan's songwriting combined with jimi's arrangement
>>was stupendous: even bob dylan has played it jimi's way since he
>>first heard it.
>>
>>a track that is timeless is ye olde "greensleeves". shit is mad
>>old, still sounds hot.
>>
>>a track that conveys emotion is "sleepwalk" by santo and johnny.
>>it just drips with an otherworldly emotional vision, despite being
>>made in 1950 with common instruments.
>>
>>a brilliantly composed song is "i want it that way", popularized
>>by the backstreet boys. this is a perfect example of a great song
>>not being able to be ruined even by the most inept and clueless

>>
>>now in order for music to be bad, it has to fall into one or more
>>of these categories:
>>
>>it is made purely for commercial purposes
>>it expresses false/no emotions
>>it is derivative of some other music, while removing the essential

>>
>>a great example of all 3 is Muzak. they take out the emotion of
>>good music, make it as inoffensive as possible, and use it to sell
>>products to you in a shopping environment.
>>
>>an example of the first category is any commercial jingle: as
>>catchy as the melodies may be, a commercial tune can never be good
>>music. theme songs from films and television shows, however, are
>>(sometimes) meant as artistic expressions despite their use in
>>selling the movie/tv show. so they can be good music.
>>
>>an example of the second is any cheesy pop punk tune, sung by
>>white suburban rich kids talking about how hard their lives are
>>because they dont have an SUV or whatever. i mean you can turn on
>>the radio and hear these fuckers whining any given moment. more

>>

>>
>>let me just point out here the originality means NOTHING when

>>
>>to get further into some more difficult classifications, lets look

>>background music. it is not time specific, but it is not timeless
>>either, exactly. however, it is absolutely brilliant in concept,
>>and that concept is timeless. thats enough to make it good music.
>>something like richie hawtin's live performances, despite the fact

>>timeless, or interesting. its a little derivative of people like
>>steve reich, brian eno, phillip glass, etc, but applied to techno
>>in the least innovative way possile: the music still essentially
>>sounds the same without his concept as it does with it.
>>
>>now lets examine king tubby. this is a perfect example of a person

>>however, he would be relegated to the "bad for the sake of

>>EXCELLENT. the studio 1 reggae at the time was off the hook,
>>dubbed or not.
>>
>>now i want to talk about white emcees. i generally dont like white

>>end up sounding like a parody of black emcees, or they trivialize
>>themselves and poke fun at everything to the point where they are

>>

14 year old minnesotian teenagers dont have the brain power to distinguish
good from bad music, therefore they must rely on clear channel to provide
them with the 40 song playlist they must choose a favorite from.  :o)  plus
they're from minnesota, it's winter time, they dont have time to listen to
music, they're all playing hockey.

<good music MUST contain one or more of these qualities: 

it conveys feeling/emotion 
it is timeless 
it is brilliantly composed/arranged/produced>

Omittimg something, Tom? How about the quality THAT IT MAKES PEOPLE DANCE! I don't just mean the little cutsie bump and grind crap, I mean the leap-out-of-your-chair, work-up-a-sweat, can't-sit-still, keep-moving-for-10-hours-nonstop DANCE. Music is movement. It's physical AND mental. It should send your imagination alive. It should make your mind and your body move with it. I've gotten into this argument with you before when I was posting under my old e-mail address of "trinity." You said you don't like to go out and dance when you go to parties, that you'd rather just sit and listen to it. Fine, but don't try to tell the rest of us who are into whole genres of music for its physicality that we have bad taste in music because we get a completely different experience out of it. Now get off your ass and move around a bit. At Roxy in NYC I saw at least a dozen folks in wheelchairs dancing in their own way to the music that Tiesto was spinning. Their disabilities didn't prevent them from expressing themselves to the music in the ways they wanted to. What's your excuse?

to begin, i should clarify one point that i left out in my 
argument about good music being objective. this is actually 
related to the discovery i made that led to my developing the 
theory in the first place. what i observed is that just about any 
person who is a serious fan of music, no matter what their initial 
background in music was, eventually starts to fall into the 
pattern of listening to a few distinct musicians: miles davis, lee 
perry, sun ra, and george clinton were the artists that most 
immediately jumped out at me. there are plenty of other artists, 
but those were the most obvious. my point being that the ability 
to distinguish between good and bad music involves serious study 
of music in general. you cant just expose yourself to pop music 
and then assume that because you like christina aguilera that her 
music is good. i must reiterate, the fact that you like it is 
meaningless! everyone i know likes some bad music, but only the 
people who are really into music are able to make the distinction 
between what they like and quality music. basically, in order to 
be able to learn how to tell the difference yourself, start 
listening to music in every genre from every time period that you 
can. and realise that youll never hear it all, but that the more 
you hear the better suited you are to tell good music from bad 
music.

>As for timelessness, such is relativist as well. For the next 
fifty years, 
>teenie boppers might one after another rediscover Christina's

look, i still like listening to late 80's early 90's bad pop music 
and it still doesnt make it "timeless". it does however bring back 
memories of my youth. the difference is like this: look at someone 
like tony bennet, who for most intents and purposes claims his 
fans from mostly older fans. this is a perfect example of 
nostalgia, not good music. on the other hand, you have the 
beatles. young kids hear their music today, and become as in love 
with it as their parents were. same with people like marvin gaye, 
sun ra, george clinton, etc. there is a distinct difference, and 
timelessness is not relative.

i trivialize nothing. i only encourage more musical exposure and 
education, that will begin to show how truly wrong the idea 
that "what i like is what's good" is. this doesnt mean that people 
shouldnt listen to bad music, theyre free to listen to whatever 
they like. however, before they start talking about music 
being "bad", they should edumicate themselves about it before they 
start looking foolish talking down micheal jackson and talking up 
prog house. and progressive house fan who is a student of music 
will laugh at someone like that.

>Omittimg something, Tom? How about the quality THAT IT MAKES 
PEOPLE DANCE! I don't just mean the little cutsie bump and grind 
crap, I mean the leap-out-of-your-chair, work-up-a-sweat, can't-
sit-still, keep-moving-for-10-hours-nonstop DANCE. 

so by that reasoning, happy hardcore might be the best music ever. 
or maybe hard house. those genres of music certainly fall into 
that category. since that is obviously not the case, your argument 
carries no weight. 

>Music is movement. It's physical AND mental. It should send your 
imagination alive. It should make your mind and your body move 
with it.

sure, and no music does that better than good music. 

>I've gotten into this argument with you before when I was posting 
under my old e-mail address of "trinity." You said you don't like 
to go out and dance when you go to parties, that you'd rather just 
sit and listen to it. Fine, but don't try to tell the rest of us 
who are into whole genres of music for its physicality that we 
have bad taste in music because we get a completely different 
experience out of it. 

now here's where you have to start breaking your opinions off from 
reality. if you are cool with getting a purely physical reaction 
out of music, thats fine and dandy. thats a valid reason for you 
to want to listen to music. but that DOESNT mean that its good 
music! if you can just admit that, then our argument is over. i 
own just about every one of paula abdul's singles on 12". i like 
listening to them because i like ultra cheesy mainstream early 90s 
dance music because it reminds me of a certain time in my life 
where i enjoyed dancing to it and listening to it. but despite any 
physical reactions i might still have to it (which to the best of 
my knowledge is nearly none unlesss im real drunk) i can recognize 
that it isnt good music. 

>Now get off your ass and move around a bit. At Roxy in NYC I saw 
at least a dozen folks in wheelchairs dancing in their own way to 
the music that Tiesto was spinning. Their disabilities didn't 
prevent them from expressing themselves to the music in the ways 
they wanted to. What's your excuse?

hey, i dance when i want to. which is decently frequently if the 
deejay is playing good music. like anything, when you start having 
more and more experience, the cheap thrills quit meaning so much 
to you. at this point in my life, ive heard enough purely physical 
dance music that it doesnt do anything to me in any way. it sounds 
cheap to me. you start playing something deep and funky and im on 
it like white on rice on a paper plate in a snowstorm. 

just to make sure you realise something, im not saying that i have 
always been able to recognize this distinction. it was only a 
little over 2 years ago that i started to grow irritated with the 
substance of jungle music, which up until then was my dance music 
of choice. but once i had my realization, i just quit worrying 
about listening to anything except good music. if im going to 
invest all my time and money into music, which i do, im going to 
make sure its worthwhile to me in 20 years when my son is trying 
to raid my record collection. he wont be dissappointed like i am 
with my parents' collection. the music i have now will be as good 
then as it is now. im sure some of it will gain true popularity 
only long periods of time from now when the average person has 
heard enough electronic music to be able to distinguish between 
good and bad music. but thats cool, im not worried.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Influential Artists was  Re: Any Reviews of Josh Wink or Michael Myers?

onto tom's list I'm gonna start to add who I think people come to respect as
good music (artists not from my nostalgic time period)..

"c0xxy" listed
 > miles davis, lee perry, sun ra, marvin gay, the beatles, and george
clinton

pink floyd - moreso when you actually start to research into the band, the
parallels their songs have with events (most notably the wizard of oz/dsotm
parallel) and a respect for the band members as much more than just musical
artists, but genii of thinking.

u2 - i didnt have much exposure to u2 until the last couple years (since
around 98-99) when i actually heard more than one or 2 songs on the radio.
so i dont label them as nostalgic for me at all, i just really respect what
they do as performers.  They have great stage presence, they have millions
of people around the world singing along to 'sunday bloody sunday' in
stadiums, arenas, etc, and sympathizing with the pain in their own home
country.  young people and old people enjoy u2, but at the same time i know
people that do not enjoy this style of music at all, but they have been an
influence on contemporary pop/adult contemporary so much that i couldnt
leave them out on what they have influenced.

bob marley - even if most people dont know anything about reggae/dub/etc,
they know the lyrics to the songs of this man.  I dont think i need to say
anything else here.

james brown - makes people dance, isnt political, yet people relate...

i: am a sex machine.
i: get up
i: get on up

dave matthews will not be featured on my list because he is a dirty hippy
and does not inspire me to do anything except get fucked up. :o)

-Goose

Just curious, but how were so many of you able to go out and party the night
before Thanksgiving, and still have enough energy the next day to eat and
spend the holiday with your families? }}

Fool I'm a vet, you can bet... that I can dance underwater, and not get wet.

{{ Matt B. <ctnproductions@hotmail.com> }
I had the energy, my stomach was kinda woozy though so I couldnt eat a lot
of turkey.. }}

Liar. You were passed the fuck out on your pricey champagne. How does my
anus taste?

Correct, if youre interested in attaining tha desire to KILL YOURSELF a few 
hours later.   I'm sure HHC has driven many to kill, or at least being

From: "Goose" <goose@andythepooh.com>

>onto tom's list I'm gonna start to add who I think people come to 
respect as
>good music (artists not from my nostalgic time period)..
>
>pink floyd 

ack. i will vehemently argue against this. they fall into the 
rush "innovation/experimentation/virtuosity" category. when youre 
too good at your instrument or think about your music too much, 
you get into making really horrible music just because you can. 
for more examples, see smashing pumpkins post siamese dream, rush, 
yngbie malmsteen, steve vai, joe satriani, dream theatre, etc. 

a good example of a band who is good and does what pink floyd wish 
they could do is Tool.  

>u2 

yeah U2 have had a consistant output of diverse music, good 
politics, and generally great pop music. i dont know if theyre on 
par with the people whom i names or the 2 people you listed after 
them, but theyre good for the most part. in with them i throw in 
REM, theyre like the same band to me. i go through these phases of 
rediscovering REM and U2 at the same time every couple of years. 

>bob marley 

yeah he's in there. so is jimi hendrix. i view them as sort of 
similar in that they are both loved widely by white people who 
smoke pot, yet they fail to truly appreciate how great their music 
really is. i own something like 15 bob marley albums, more than 
just about anyone else except lee perry and drexciya. 

>james brown - makes people dance, isnt political, yet people 
relate...

i dont know, james had his political shit going on sometimes too. 
ive had arguments with people i know about the most influential 
musicians of the 20th century, and my argument has always been for 
james brown. there were some other decent arguments (gershwin, 
velvet underground, etc) but ill stick with the godfather of soul, 
the hardest working man in showbusiness...........

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Sneaker pimps

My review....bare with me...I'm fucking tired after
that 3 hour nap on the car-ride home.

So Mr. Paul Fleetwood picks me up from work about
2:45ish and we head out towards C-bus, make a few turns
and stuff, but are well on our way by like 3:15.
Traffic wasn't too bad.  Get there about 6:20 and go to
some Brew-Pub place Goose told us to meet at name
Barley's.  Good dinner, good beer.  After eating, we
headed out to the show.  I must say Mekka (or whatever
it's called) is a nice little venue.  Like Goose said,
the overall turnout was low, I'm guessing no more like
100 people were there.
The Dj that Opened for them, Scottie Boombox or
whatever his name was made me wanna rip my arm off and
beat myself with it.  He was horrible.  I've been
informed he apparently gets booked a lot.  That is SAD.
Sneakerpimps were decent....the sounds was cranks up to
high, so things were off.  Plus, trip hop just isn't
the same without female vocals usually (IMHO).  But it
was good.  They played my favorite song Small Town
Witch.  And I also learned the lead singer has a
molesterache.  We were all sitting upstairs and when we
first came on stage, we all thought he was a chick.
Had quite  afew drinks...which are expensive
considering they give you a tiny little glass filled
with ice and hardly any alcohol. That was shit.  Then
when it was over, Paul and I were dropped off at our
car, and headed home.

Some highlights:
Paul asking the gas station attendant when we were
leaving to go home if they sold Redbull and Vodka.

My brilliant Idea for a new resturant where the food
and beverages are named after bodily functions, sexual
acts, and other things typically found to be
unpleasant.

Thanks Goose, and Paul (especially Paul for doing all
the driving to and from) for a kick-ass night.

Time for me to go to bed now.  I have work in the
morning....damnnit.

It's a funny thing because I can understand perfectly other peoples'
hatred of HHC. Personally, I happen to love it; and really, I think I
could listen to it in lieu of every other kind of music, almost
indefinitly. I used to have 6 or 7 HHC CDs that I would rotate in my
car CD player and for like 6 months they were all I listened to.
*And* even after 6 months of continual HHC-listening, the music still
"did it" for me -- made me feel happy. I could *still* get into that
goddamned happy, fast, scary music.

Subject: {pb-cle} Formal Protest

That's IT! I'm calling Al Sharpton. (And/Or Johnny Cochrane).

The Tom Cox-ification of this list is now out of control.

<<in my humble cracker opinion...>>

When stuff like that is uttered in posts that have nothing whatsoever to do
with Tom berating the white-trashiest of uneducated "Trailer Park Trumps",
then things are baaaaaaaad all over.

"We have to learn to live together. That means white, really white,
so-white-you're-almost-transparent, beige, all of us!!! Living together as
one!"

Sincerely,
Jesse's Love Child

Umm...sorry for beating the dead horse, but:

"Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud"?
"King Heroin"?
"Unity" (a duet with Afrikaa Baambaataa)??

There are many other examples. Brown was very outspoken back in the day.

how is that political?

what i meant by political is that he wasnt saying anything challenging the
status quo, he was more providing motivation for unity in the community, and
reasons not to hang your head cause of your color.

it didnt challenge the establishment, it did challenge other blacks to not
be ashamed of who they are and where they come from.

it began in afrika (kaaa kaa ka ka)

I dunno.  I don't think that just cause you don't
challenge the "status quo" as you call it doesn't mean
music can't have political messages to it.

I guess I sort of see what you're saying...if you mean
that music that's deals with being satisfied with the
state of things...whether or not that's political is
debatable...but I think you don't necessarily have to
be trying to discontent.  Let me see if I can explain
what I mean using examples...
U2's Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Political.  No question
about it.
Salt-n-Pepper's Lets Talk about Sex. Political?  Maybe.
Contraversial?  Definitely.  I suppose it really just
depends how you're defining "political".
On the one hand, you could say that to be political, it
must look at some form/part of goverment, law, etc.
But there are a lot of things that don't fit those
definitions that we consider to be political topics, I
suppose largely because they are typically issues that
political parties/groups/factions disagree upon.

<<it didnt challenge the establishment, it did challenge other blacks to not
be ashamed of who they are and where they come from.>>

And in the heavily race-biased 1960's, this was not challenging the "white
establishment"?

By challenging your audience to stand up and be counted as a people and a
viable entity unto themselves is fairly challenging, in my opinion.

By that thinking, a tune like Parliament-Funkadelic's "Chocolate City"
wouldn't necessarily be "political" according to the textbook definition
you're applying here. Or would it be since it presents a "we need some black
representation in office" theme??

Would "Pride (In The Name of Love)" by U2 qualify?? I'm actually asking
here, so if I'm wrong, tell me.

I suppose I misunderstood your take on 'political'...

<<it began in afrika (kaaa kaa ka ka)>>

DEFINITELY not political...

But good for shakin' that ass....

any music made by blacks has always been a threat to white society... even
as recently as the 90's i think was the last time i heard the phrase "jungle
music" to describe music made by blacks... here we get into the grey area
between political stress and racial bias, and you're mixing alot of things
together, which is why i dont see it as predominantly political in tone as
much as it is rebellious to whitey in a race statement.  it isnt challenging
the establishment, it's challenging the people who comprise the
establishment.

white vs black challenge, awareness, racial undertones.

i see that as more political than racial... it is structured around
representation for the population of a culture.  just as political parties
share representation, racial parties too desire and obtain representation
when it is the wishes of the majority

I see that as a celebratory song for the greatness of MLK's life and as a
testament to how much he was able to bring about change in people's
attitudes/racial bias.  indirectly it affected the establisment, but i see
it more as a way u2 paid homage to a fallen hero in reiteration that he only
did it for the love of mankind.

> I suppose I misunderstood your take on 'political'...


i guess i just think of political a different way... but i do definately see
your side of things...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Influential Artists was  Re: Any Reviews of Josh Wink or Michael Myers?

(Here's where we go waaaaaaaaaaaay far off topic....sorry folks.)

<<any music made by blacks has always been a threat to white society...>>

I think I disagree.

To some level, from the "popularization" of jazz from the 20's to the 40's
(think Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, etc.), up to and including the doo
wop and smarmy "lounge" entertainment of the 50's and early 60's, a generous
percentage of Black entertainers were generally regarded as "safe" for white
audiences.....

Sammy Davis Jr. could sing to you, but he had to drink from a different
water fountain as you....that sort of thing.

<<even as recently as the 90's i think was the last time i heard the phrase
"jungle music" to describe music made by blacks...>>

pfffft....my mother called it that last week!

<<here we get into the grey area between political stress and racial bias,
and you're mixing alot of things together, which is why i dont see it as
predominantly political in tone as much as it is rebellious to whitey in a
race statement.  it isnt challenging the establishment, it's challenging the
people who comprise the establishment.>>

The core of Brown's audience was definitely NOT the "establishment" in the
early to mid 60's.

I understand exactly what you're saying, but where we disagree is that you
can't really separate the two. See my next statement about "cultural
context".

<<white vs black challenge, awareness, racial undertones.>>

I see what you mean, but the difference is...he wasn't doing a "be black for
the sake of being black" song...it wasn't about the struggle for identity
the way the big "roots resurgence" of the 90's rap scene was...

(And I realize I'm splitting hairs here, but the cultural context is
everything in this discussion...)

The political scene in the 60's spawned Brown's desire to do a song like
"Black and Proud". Had the climate not been so heated as far as race
relations, integration, etc. were concerned, would the song have even been
necessary?? Or, if Black-America had equal representation in all facets of
life (political, business, education), would the song not have been just
redundant?

So maybe because of the poitically charged scene of the 60's, the song
became a de facto political statement, even if, at best, the author intended
only a call to arms of his audience to self-awareness.

How's that for treading the middle ground??  ;-)

Check out anything on DATA Recordings, a Trancecore/Freeform label....very
acidy and slightly goa-ish, but still Hardcore.

Mark,
Tenaglia no longer plays at vinyl.  I just got back from NYC 2 weeks ago, 
and he had a falling out with management and quit on the spot.  Word on the 
street is he's working on opening his own club.  Try Centro-Fly.  I saw 
Farina there.  It was pretty sweet.  Check out Baktun, also, if you can 
handle the droves of sweaty, barely dressed Chelsey Boys.

Peace,
Darre

Danny Tanaglia does play Vinyl every Friday (now
called Arc). It's $20/25 to get in.

Baktun is far from a sweaty Chelsea boys hang out. You
must be reffering to the Roxy, or Exit for Junior
Varsquez on Saturdays. Baktun has a DnB night on
Saturday, and Techno on Mondays, and both are always
full.

Ciao,
Viktor

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Question for some NYC heads...

How recently did Arc start?  I read an article in an NYC weekly 
entertainment mag, (can't remember the name; not the "voice") that was 
talking about the problems Tenaglia was having with the new vinyl 
management, and most everyone i talked to said it was no longer happening.  
As far as Baktun, we're either talking about something completely different 
or your idea of a Chelsea bar is different from mine.  I went on a 
Wednesday, and it was it was about as Chelsea as it gets :)

Subject: {pb-cle} RE: Influential Artists

In terms of both political as well as artistic influences, don't forget about John Lennon. If you haven't seen the exhibit about him and Yoko at the Rock Hall, you MUST. http://www.rockhall.com/exhibitions/featured.asp?id=954

The documentary films presented at the exhibit are amazing. The collection of letters and artifacts is haunting. I descended the escalators of the top floor (the last of the exhibit) with tears running down my cheeks. 

Not coincidentally, Yoko performed a vocal piece at Danny Tenaglia's marathon 16-hour set at Space in Miami at the Winter Music Conference this year. It was a gift to have her presence, almost indicative of her blessing, on our scene. I didn't appreciate her, her presence at a dance music conference, and John until I saw the exhibit. GO. It will help anyone explore the complex relationship between music, politics, and society.

louis armstrong == uncle tom.

ella fitzgerald was an armstrong ripoff in scat stylings, but at the same
time, the strongest of all your arguments in 'white tolerance of black
entertainers'

sammy davis jr is not 'black', he sang 'white' songs, nothing he performed
was 'taboo' or controversial to ameriKKKans.  He married May Britt and
converted to judaism.  He was shunned by many blacks because of this.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: Question for some NYC heads... 


<How much is it to get into Vinyl on a night when Tenaglia plays?? 

m >

Depends on which night you go. His residency is on Fridays, and is usually $25.

But, he's been doing a lot of teaming with Danny Howells, and those nights are usually $35.

Also depends on the time you go: If you want lower cover, get there around midnight or 1am. Doors may open earlier, I'm not sure. The first Howells/Tenaglia party I went to there, I had friends coming in at around 5am who had to pay over $60 to get in. Tenaglia is known for marathons, so if you can hang, be prepared to be dancing well into the next day. I mean, WELL into the next day. The vibe is at its best around 6am.

Note also that it's now called "Arc." If you're a boozehound, you'll be disappointed. No alcohol served. Expect some yummy juice and energy drinks and protein bars. Web site at: www.arcspace.net

and? obviously you cant pay enough attention to read when i said
that experimental music is often bad, but alot of influence can be
taken from it and used to make good music. i am aware of the
influence of floyd on tool. and im aware of the influence of rush
on primus. that doesnt mean that floyd and rush are good just
because tool and primus are good.

In their early days, from 1966-1972, Pink Floyd was the most diverse, 
eclectic and skilled set of muscians out there.  In one of their sets, you 
would hear brit-pop, classic dirty blues covers and original blues, jazz, 
classical, feedback-laden acid grooves, and it was all done and combined 
extremely well.  Syd Barret was one of the most highly skilled guitar 
players of his era, hands down, and any serious musician will tell you as 
such.  Barrett taught David Gilmour (Floyd's later frontman and widely 
regarded as one of the finest guitar players EVER) everything that he knew.  
They might not have had the knack for cutting pop hits like The Beatles, but 
listen to some early, early Floyd, and it is more eclectic, more pyschedlic, 
more experimental and better musically than Sgt. Pepper could have ever 
dreamed.  Floyd weren't a pop band  or even a real rock band back then, they 
were just amazing musicians, all of whom had classical and contemporary 
mucial training at some of England's finest art schools.  In 1972, with the 
coming of "Dark Side,"  their music changed, some would say for the better, 
some would say for the worse.  But the fact remains that they remained 
awesome musicians.
Roger Water's thunderous basslines have been pilaged for countless hip-hop 
tracks.  Ask any major hip-hop producer out there about the things that can 
be done with a Roger Waters bassline.  Liking Floyd or not is one thing.  
They have several albums i can't stand.  But to argue that they aren't great 
muscians who make quality music, however, is just not on mark. And to argue 
that Tool are better MUSICIANS is just plain retarded.

i dont know buddy, tool are some damn intense musicians. but it
doesnt matter at all, your expertise at your intstrument means
nothing in deciding if music is good or bad. bob dylan made some
excellent music, he was not really any good at playing guitar or
singing. going to "art school" or "music school" doesnt mean shit
either. you cant be taught how to make music that means something
to you. you CAN be taught techniques, but like i said before lots
of "virtuosos" get caught up making music that is technically
challenging but lacks any qualities to make it good music. and
once again, your influence doesnt mean shit either. nor does being
sampled by hiphop producers. i can think of dope hiphop loops made
from steely dan records that i would otherwise not own at all. 

and i also find it insulting to compare any pop record to sgt.
peppers.

also ill point out that this is a eurocentric view, for sure. i
can think of plenty of people who were diverse and skilled
musicians at the same time who were combining shit that was never
done and were doing while making GOOD music: jimi hendrix, sun ra
and the arkestra, miles davis, and the skatalites immediately jump
to mind. 

>Syd Barret was one of the most highly skilled guitar

what is a "serious" musician? IMO the idea of a "serious" musician
is a serious joke. but anyway, for guitar playing from the 60s and
70s ill pick jimi hendrix, ernest ranglin, robert fripp, wes
montgomery, and jimmy nolen long before id take fucking syd
barret. and if you wanna get into more modern guitarists, the list
would be much much much much much much longer. 

>Barrett taught David Gilmour (Floyd's later frontman and widely

by people who have no education in music. there were so many
greater guitarists than him its sad. but none of this has anything
to do with making good music.

but it wasnt better music! and thats all that matters! really,
floyd have a couple listenable tracks, but overall they made
sacrifices for their vision of music, and it cost them, since most
of their music was pretty bad.

i mean really, dream theatre could probably blow them away in
terms of technical prowess, but both of them make crap music so it
doesnt matter.

i wont argue against their skill at their instruments. but as soon
as you can show me the correlation between being a good musician
and making good music, thats when ill say that pink floyd made
good music. until then, good luck trying to prove it.

and i knew as soon as i sent this id remember someone else who
would crush on barret at guitar and make great music: john
mclaughlin. his efforts with miles davis on the "bitches brew"
album and then the truly awesome and interesting rock band
Mahavishnu Orchestra were outstanding. he crushes shit.

What Floyd did in their early live performances, before Barrett's LSD 
consumtion made him a slobbering, drooling blob, was and still is completely 
unparalled in its energy and muscianship.  The only experience even remotely 
close to and early Floyd show ( early being anything before their 1968 
American Tour) is a rave party in its heydey.  Granted, the crowds may not 
have been as enormous, but what they did with combining simultaneos 
stimulation was truly groundbreaking (and good) and was subsequently 
emulated but never matched by artists like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson 
Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, Carlos Santana, just to name a few.  If 
you ever see it anywhere, check out the video clips (its a rare bootleg) of 
scenes from the 14-hour Technicolor Dream, the 14-hour live set they played 
in London in 1967.  It is, quite plainly, awe-inspring and if you see it, 
you might just think differently.
In Gump-style, that is all i have to say about that.
I can hear the bar beckoning.
Have a good night, Tom.
Always a pleasure.
peace,
Darren

>Please.  The Beatles ARE pop music.  

of course they are. but in the context of concept albums in pop 
music, that one is probably one of the best. if you count george 
clinton as pop music, he would be the only "pop" figure to eclipse 
the beatles in conceptual shit. 

>you down with OBB?
>(original boy band) :)

ha, another eurocentric view. you forgetting about motown?

not to get really nitpicky, but how do you know? were you there? i 
mean im sure some people will say some similar shit about the 
grateful dead (more crap music), and i dont believe that shit 
either. 

>Granted, the crowds may not

you must be joking. miles davis was simply one of the greatest 
musical minds, to say that he copied and never eclipsed ideas of 
Pink Floyd is seriously offensive to me. ditto with jimi hendrix. 
the rest of those musicians can suck a dick, they didnt mean shit.

doubtful. ive said before and ill say it again, i am in no way 
biased against good music. i actively pursue good music every day. 
i would be very excited to discover more good music, especially 
somewhere ivve already looked. however, before writing something 
off, i generally do a good bit of research. i even own some floyd 
on vinyl. it doesnt mean that its really truly any good. 

>I can hear the bar beckoning.
>Have a good night, Tom.
>Always a pleasure.

hahaha. try drinking some more then arguing, i bet we'd get 
farther faster......

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

nearly 1400 people were in attenDANCE and with your help, we donated over
800 toys to charity in Dayton, Cincinnati, and Detroit.  This year we
expect to raise the bar even further with 6 headlining acts, Santa Claus
once again on the 1's and 2's spinning a sick-ass jungle set, NEW
HEADLINING TALENT, techno, trance, jungle, breaks, house, the chance to
get your picture taken with Santa, decorations, laser by Introspective,
banging sound by THUNDERSOUND, AND Bill-E performing a 3 hour live DRUM
set in the main room!  We promise your expectations will be exceeded and
your holiday will never be the same!  Like always, we pride ourselves in
bringing in new AND established talent - this time, we're just bringing
more!

***WINTER WONDERLAND 2***

DDR - London, United Kingdom (LIVE PA) - www.damndjs.com - Techno/Acid 
Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well 
as Stay Up Forever, Cluster and Choci's Chewns.  Whether you like trance 
house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno 
- Chris Anderson is one of those rare jacks-of-all-trades who has his hand 
in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic 
culture and if you like hard, techy, funky and acidic beats - look no 
further!

DJ Rip - Chicago, Illinois - Substance USA - www.fusedmanagement.com / 
www.djrip.com - Hard Progressive/Hard House - You know him, you love him 
and after last year's performance, we just had to bring him back. 
 Acclaimed DJ and respected Producer, Rip has brought the roof down all 
over the U.S. and Canada and on into Europe.  His production work includes 
works with Angel Alanis, Bam Bam, Alex Peace and more.  Rip is now taking 
his efforts to the next level moving his work into the progressive/tech 
area and he has been host of several Chicago area radio shows over time. 
 Without question he is a driving force bringing our Midwest culture to
the next level!

Vibe Raider & Urbane - Madison, Wisconsin - www.wellknowndjs.com - Drum &
Bass - These two MW females need no introduction!  Having rocked
throughout the Midwest and Canada together and separately, they have left
many a dancefloor in devastation.  With hard driving drum codes and wicked
bass lines, they will be performing a special hour and a half tag team
that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002 
WMC in Florida and had to bring her in to Ohio for her first appearance! 
 You won't want to miss this set!

Phuzze - Madison, Wisconsin - Trounce Records / www.poopiehead.net - Tech

out there.

GlassCity Records Presents:
*Arrival*
Monday, December 23rd 2002
Toledo, Ohio
Robert Armani - Chicago - Techno - High Octane

When you put the words "Chicago" and "Techno" together one man comes to
mind, Robert Armani! The south side "Crown Royal Funksta" has been a
techno staple for the last decade and his discography puts him in a league
all his own. On his first trip to spin in Italy he realized his true
calling while studying to be a Chicago Police officer (we almost lost
him). Just the mention of "Blow It Out", "Burn Out", "Big Dick", "Playing
With a Rubber Band", "Ambulance", and, of course, "Circus Bells", brings
back memories of dancing to them over the past ten years at rave parties
and in clubs all around the world. Dance Mania, ACV, Dust Traxx,
Djax-Up-Beats, and High Octane are the labels where his music has been
released and his remixes of JB3 (Joey Beltram), Paul Johnson, Dave Clarke,
Blake Baxter, Armando, and even Gary Numan have elevated him to the
highest of heights. With sixteen full length album releases and over sixty
single releases it has been hard to avoid Mr. Armani's work while flippin'
through any techno bin. His relentless tour schedule has him on the road
non-stop and his hard hitting, dirty, Chicago Techno has rocked clubs
since his early days of spinning. This is a man of Techno royalty and we
are happy to live under his reign.

Translucent - Chicago - House/Techno - Transparent, DTX 

Translucent, also known as Jason Torres, has been playing and studying
music for over sixteen years. Having been influenced by jazz artists such
as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Charlie Parker, Jason started playing
the trumpet and piano at a young age. His dedication to music earned him a
full jazz scholarship to the prestigious Roosevelt University in Chicago
where, in 1994, he was influenced by another style of music known as House
Music. Jason then began DJing and started something new and fresh in the
dance community: playing live trumpet while spinning records, combining
the elements of live jazz with electronic music. Noticing that Jason had
something special, Paul Johnson, the creator of the gold record "Get, Get
Down," helped Jason create connections in Chicago. Since then, Translucent
has played live trumpet with such greats as Derrick Carter, Timo Maas,
Mark Farina, Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr., Glenn Underground,
Cajmere, Boo Williams, Carlos, and Halo. Recent recording projects include
Glenn Underground's new album on Guidance, work with Derrick Carter on
classic, and Gene Farris on Fluential.

ESP Woody McBride Live!
Minneapolis : Communique USA, Bush, Drop Bass Network *
That's right, live! Back in the day Woody and his mighty 303's could be 
spotted here and there, but then the gear went into the studio and never 
came back out...until now. Kicking off his "I'm Psychic You Know..." World 
Tour with his first live performance in our part of the Midwest since Even 
Furthur '96. An hour and a half of wowie-zowie, tripped-out, 
heart-pounding original techno and acid in the tradition of submission to 
the great cosmic energy. Make sure to check out www.djesp.com for info 
about his new on some of the most exciting labels in techno.
Starscream aka #0 from
Des Moines : www.SoundProofCoalition.com, DVS, Matix, Vestax *
Lord almighty! The dj from the most extreme band in heavy metal is coming 
to rock you like a hurricane with insane turntablist skills. His sights 
are locked in on Milwaukee, ready to drop the drum-n-bass and raga like 
you've never heard it before.
Punisher
Detroit : Seismic, Reload, Matrix *
Back by popular demand! Last spring she came out and worked over everyone 
at underground, inc. with an unbelievable set of bangin' beats. This time 
the pint-sized pocket of precise mixing has some new tricks in store for 
another techno lashing.
House Preservation Society
Mystic Bill and Davey Dave
Chicago *
This veteran pair of Windy City all stars has been banging the box 
non-stop since the early days of warehouse and loft parties. United once 
again for a then and now taste of Chicago house music. You not only want 
it, you need it!
Baseck
Los Angeles/Milwaukee : Darkmatter, tigerbeat6, Massive Record Source
When Doormouse left the Midwest for sunnier skies, the Midwest Hardcorps 
faithful were left wondering were they would get their fix. The answer was 
Baseck! Blistering broken beats and anything else that is hard to the 
core; you know the score.
Feather
San Diego : Native:State, uvart.org *
Part psychedelic shaman, part performer, and part artist acting as a 
trance channel bringing forth light, oneness, and unity through the sounds 
of funky goa. Riding the flow, he has reached the masses from the SoCal 
deserts to the Burning Man festival.
Joe Vor-Tech
Brooklyn : Brooklyn Underground, Synthetic Men
Straight from the electroclash ground zero. This sassy underground music 
movement fuses the punk-inspired retro sounds of 80's new wave, synth pop, 
and electro with fashion and art to create a new music future that you 
can't help but enjoy.
TJ Richter
Inner Space : mindplasma.net *
A hyper-kinetic goblin of fun presenting a pulsating plasma of spoken 
word, light, and sound with mega-bass from outer space that flattens 
Discovery World like road kill, SQUOOSH!
Mega/Blast Fhresh
featuring J-Slim, Red Shift, and Baseck
Milwaukee : Addict, Massive Record Source
The artist formerly known as Heep Hup Fresssh. This DJ team uses sick-ass 
turntablism to create cool crunchy hip-hop soundscapes from bass, breaks, 
bleeps, and noise.

Midwest Technoclash
Expect nothing short of an all-out techno royal rumble when you take three 
of the Midwest's favorite dj's and add multiple 1200's with a barrage of 
effects.

Rusty Habitz
Milwaukee : Drop Bass Network, WBA *
versus
Wobbler

will simply move you.
Lush
Beloit : Poopiehead, Soulmates *
Saturating your spirit and making it soar with the sound of jazz-infected 
soulful house.
Diva D
Madison : Poopiehead Productions *
Queen of the decks, combining a passion for spinning with a wicked 
drum-n-bass selection.
Urbane
Madison : Cataclysmic, Well Known Djs *
Integrating hardcore and dark drum-n-bass, the result is guaranteed 
dancefloor devastation.
Michael Wenz
Milwaukee : Artist Underground, Raving Lunatiks
If the sound of acid techno is your thing, submit your soul to the 
archangel Wenzebub.

A fixture in Milwaukee clubbing, he's been known to bump the house time 
and time again.

Monster Productions presents...
Bubble Bobble <><>The Bubble Party<><>
Sat Jan 25th 2003
Central, OH
Admission: $15
>From the people who brought you B2S, the 12 hour, $4 parti in downtown... 
Justice, bringing warehouse parties back to Columbus... Back 2 Skool 2, 
keeping the columbus parti scene alive for only $6.... Bubble Bobble. This 
is an fundraiser for a HUGE event in the summer of 2003. This will have 
bubble machines running all night long!
TALENT:
Kevin Reynolds: Live Pa/Techno - Detroit, MI
Kevin is one of the best Techno artist that has ever came across the 
Mid-West and Detroit. His Funky and exhilerating style produced live will 
keep you dancing.
Thomas James: Residual Recordings - Deep House/Min. Techno - Columbus, OH
Thomas James is co-owner, with Titonton Duvante, of Residual Recordings. 
Founded in 1998, Residual is recognized worldwide for it's consistent deep 
house, and melodic techno grooves. The impressive Residual discography
boasts releases by accomplished artists such as Boo Williams, John Tejada, 
Dan Curtin, Fabrice Lig, Todd Sines and Titonton. As a DJ, Thomas James is 
known for his impecable taste in deep house, melodic and minimal techno. 
His track selection inspires and his skill motivates. Thomas has held 
residencies at Axis (Columbus), Club 504 (Columbus), Touch (Cleveland) and 
is currently half the force behind columbus' first all live electronic 
monthly event, Proceed. As host of these evenings, international caliber 
guests have included Kit Clayton, Glenn Underground, DJ Swamp, Dan Bell, 
John Tejada, Robert Hood and Hannah to name a few. Future plans include 
new 
releases on Residual, and another return to Europe where he's played in 
Switzerland and Spain.
JJ BOOGIE: www.wellknowndjs.com / www.groovereactor.com Groovereactor - 
Trance & House - Cincinnati, OH
A veteran behind the decks now in his 7th year, JJ BOOGIE
is one of the names to watch in 2003. Having been booked all over the US 
and in Canada - look for a fresh set of the top dance tracks you will ever 
hear. His peak time sets create an amazing energy and you can expect the 
whole room to be dancing non-stop. He's now touring to support the release 
of his recent mixed CD - GENESIS and his upcoming vinyl album on his own 
Groove Reactor Records.
Quantum: Mythodic/CEG/Ritual - House/Progressive - Columbus, OH
To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.
Nostalgic: Downtown Entertainment - Funky Breaks - Dayton, OH
Aus-10: Ascension DJ's - Intelligent DNB - Columbus, OH
NautiKat: Ascension DJ's - Female UK Hard House/Trance - Columbus, OH
Oompaloompa: Airplane Clique - Trance - Norwood, OH
Glennard Skynard: so real ent. - HHC - Columbus, OH

Depth and I rocked it in akron oh last night, and I have to say, DAMN!!
They got it goign on at annabelles.  They said the turnout was "slow"
due to finals week, but shit, to us it was pretty packed.  It seems like
the crowd is a mix of college kids and ravers, but everyone DANCES! Even
the "hoochies" and "fratboys" that people on this list would criticize for
being out at a spot were getting down.  I must say, you guys got it going
on in the OH in terms of energy right now.

still not receiving list mail,

They got it goign on at annabelles. They said the turnout was "slow"
due to finals week, but shit, to us it was pretty packed. It seems like
the crowd is a mix of college kids and ravers, but everyone DANCES! Even
the "hoochies" and "fratboys" that people on this list would criticize for
being out at a spot were getting down. I must say, you guys got it going
on in the OH in terms of energy right now.

bringing in rennie pilgrem would be a good start for moda to get away from
the strictly progressive stance they seem to have...now we just need to
convince them to bring in the old AWOL crew for a nite...see what that
system can really do....

if rennie pilgrem actually came out to moda i might actually consider
thinking about possibly going there.

Subject: Re: Fwd: Re: {pb-cle} Rennie Pilgrem in OHIO ?

I really don't care who brings rennie pilgrem in...I'd drive up to three 
hours to see him.  The same for any world talent.  Some food for thought, 
the man who got me spinning nu-breaks actually has a VERY nice talent 
roster.  Also he spins great electro / nubreaks himself, I gave a copy of 
his cd to 7-up to give to tim or ted to try to bring into PB but I've never 
heard any response (also after following up several times).  He actually 
just did a remix with Jackal & Hyde.  Draco from wilmington, NC.  Also 
founder of Native records (TCR's USA label).  Check him and his talent at 
www.releasedjs.com

There are some changes going on with release right now but I know you can 
contact him at either Draco@release.com or info@release.com.  I'd list some 
of the talent but it is just too sick for hotmail and the message might get 
kicked back (hee hee) just check it out for yourselves.

Peace,
J

Its five freakin dollars. Sorry that it said "free" on the flyer but there
might have been a mishap with the owner and the promoter or something.
Atleast they didnt try charging you 20 for being a smart ass...

Of course every

I think you should recalculate your numbers. There's a whole back room with
pool tables, a whoole front area back where the bar is, and also a vip
section room that you can jam out to.

Cause we were to busy gettin drunk.. :P

First off, she didnt steal it. What happend was she was being drunk, and set
her coat in the same booth where yours was.. and sat down not knowing there
was another coat in the booth. You came up freaking out because you thought
she was "trying" to steal your coat. It wasnt like she walked away with
it... she just .. sat down.

It was all a misunderstanging and you like freaked out for nothing. Remember

Ya...  rave on duuuuuuuuude!..  If you would have actually looked at the
situation and been civil like the rest of us were doing, you would have
noticed that all this was a missunderstanding. But then again, ravers love
drama.. so dont come for the night. That just gives us one less thing to
worry about..  thank you!

It was a missunderstanding..  I dont think id leave anything of mine in any
club especially if it was my first time ever being there. Maybe you learned
your lesson...

something.

if there was a fucking mishap, they should eat the fucking cost of
the people showing up expecting to come in free. i generally only
go to free club nights, just because i know what the motivation is
of the music being played there. but i would definitely tell the
door guy to suck my cock, in no uncertain terms. promoters need to
be responsible for what they say on a flyer. i remember reid speed
being advertised like last summer in pgh as playing 2-step. i
payed my $5 to get in, and she played fucking jungle. i was livid.
i made the promoter buy me long island iced tea to make up for it. 

>Atleast they didnt try charging you 20 for being a smart ass...

there's no excuse for fuckups liek that. this should teach you all
a lesson: free club nights are the best ones.

I haven't seen Scott Henry since I went down to Buzz
with Ket, Dean, and Mike Goldman last year.  Scott
always makes me wanna move my feet.  But the room was
just sooo packed :o(  I wouldn't mind seeing him again
if someone wants to bring him to PGH.

trippy computer animation), and the coolest peeps 
in Cleveland! 

David will be tagging with the excellent DJ Darbe,

Mercury Lounge and Revolution Thursdays. Music will 
be a blend of house, progressive, tech-house, trance,

appeared on labels like Slip 'n' Slide Records, Edel, 
and Catch 22. 

Downstairs in the Pinky, Frank Delour and Seth will 
be playing hip-hop and classics. In the Tapioca room, 
Colt Seavers plays funk, rock, and R&B.

Sorry. That wasn't meant for public viewing.

But, while I'm in a pissy mood...the email did lie:

<<This e-mail was sent to you because: you signed up for it at one of our
events or on our website; you are a friend of David and/or Amy; or a friend
of yours asked us to include you in the mailing.>>

None of the above are true. The truth is you got my address from this list,
and that's against the rules.

And if the messages continue, there WILL be hard feelings.

I _DID_ ask for the info, and Amy was nice enough to help me out. And how do
I thank her? By flaming her. Jeez.

Sorry. That wasn't meant for public viewing.

But, while I'm in a pissy mood...the email did lie:

<<This e-mail was sent to you because: you signed up for it at one of our
events or on our website; you are a friend of David and/or Amy; or a friend

None of the above are true. The truth is you got my address from this list,
and that's against the rules.

And if the messages continue, there WILL be hard feelings.

It's all good. I straightened everything out (hopefully) with Amy.

Yes a message did come directly to me, but I DID ask her for future info.
This was different than the message that was sent to the list. It was an
HTML formatted email, which I hate getting unless absolutely necessary. I
was just being pissy because I'm having a shit day at work.

Please don't flame her, she's actually pretty cool. And if others start,
please, help me keep the drama down.

I hate it when I do shit I yell at other people for doing....

I've got 4 copies of this and they're all edited for radio. Is there a
"dirty" version? Listening to Westside Connection without hearing the words
"fuck" and "nigger" just isn't right.

people need to chill out. drinking alters your mind, you make mistakes. pressure has just begun to rise, we're making changes every weekend to get it better for you people. this is a new club for the dnb heads, and it hasn't been easy putting everything together. i do the flyers for danger room and i totally respect what they're trying to do. and btw, go to a $3 event at peabody's under 21 and you'll be getting in for no less than $8, if they even let you in. the under 21 surcharge of $2 isn't bad at all. and noone 21 on up was charged over $3 except for the few people who donated 5-10. much respect to those.

--0-918788414-1039227667=:61363
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


I just moved here recently and have a few questions/comments about the scene here:

1) There are no real "nights" here. It seems all the clubs play the same exact playlist and the DJs all work for the same company. Damn shame

2) Are there underground nights in any clubs? I've been to Havana which was great and to this place in South Side (Zithos?) that was great, but no "big" clubs seem to cater to "real" dance music (except that 4 in 1 place that plays all hard trance).

3) Is hip hop the only thing the masses move to? I like hip hop and all, but it seems no one has interests in anything else

4) Is this group the general consensus of the dance music community in Pittsburgh? It seems the only kind of music this board likes is drum and bass (which I really like) and 2 step. Seems very close minded to anything else...no offense

5) Who owns all these clubs that can be so close minded to what's going on in the rest of the big cities? 

I love this city for the most part, but I am curious if my obsvervations are correct.

Thanks

in pgh...

drum n bass
deep house
tech house
techno
2 step (breaks too)
progressive


the only things that i havent heard be represented in a while is
hardcore/gabber/hhc... i dont live there, but hell, it's better than
columbus where i am... we get progressive and trance... that's it... there
is a tiny dnb community, i have not heard hhc here, breaks are non-existant,
there is techno and tech house (mainly represented by titonton and mike
salamon that i've actually seen promoted/seen live)... cleveland is slightly
more diverse because of touch and the emerging akron scene... but pittsburgh
has the most stable community in this area.  you're in the right place for
good edm, bro.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Is this Pittsburgh?

haha....Goose, you haven't been here for a while then haven't you.  It seems 
EVERYONE digs hardcore up here.  I just moved here about 6 months ago from 
NC where drum and bass & breaks pretty much own the scene.  I was in for a 
HUGE shock.

I said the same thing when I got here...the scene is alot different.  Also 
alot younger & much more underground (underground almost to overkill).  I'm 
all about "underground music" but I think EVERYONE needs some exposure to 
it.  I think it's b.s. not to try to bring in a more mainstream crowd.  
After all, what if some of you would have never caught on to it?

In general the promoting also seems kinda lax (i'm used to getting ambushed 
by flier kids when leaving a party, getting hit in the head by a promotional 
cd at the end of a dj's set and hearing who's going to what party tommorow 
night).

I've also noticed quite a few parties run ass backwards  ie.) not fronting 
money, shutting sound off half way through the party multiple times to pay 
sound / security / dj's / lighting etc.  I've never heard of that before.  
Normally DJ's are contracted, deposits are paid up front, dj's are paid in 
full on sight or upon completion etc...do alot of these parties require 
contracts?  What about sound and light guys.  I figure Wizard Workshop must 
have their shit on lock down being that they have sound at almost every 
party I've been to...big ups for that one.  You guys have turbo sound?  I 
have yet to get to a party around here with turbo sound.

Also I've never been to a party before that didn't have tables (unless it's 
house party), a mixer, sound or even just a basic sound check.  This is 
absolutely unsat.  I realise throwing a party is a huge stress and a big 
responsiblity; but if I advertise that sound starts at 9:00 pm, you bet your 
ass I'd have sound and equipment all go by 7:00.  There is so much that can 
go wrong and setting up your shit 30 mins before start, that just doesn't 
cut it.

Also I've never actually been "shaken down" before walking into a party.  It 
would appear to me if you want to keep cops from bothering you, you might as 
well attempt to make it look like you have decent security and are trying to 
keep drugs and weapons out of your venue.  Are constables or off duty pd 
allowed to work at parties around here?  A very good friend of mine works 
for Raliegh PD, he told me himself that if he'd see an officer in or out of 
uniform at a party working he normaly will just ask him if everything has 
been ok for the evening and roll on out.  Rather than start snooping all 
over some unprepaired promoter ass.

I think someone here could spark up the scene to where it needs to be, I'm 
just not sure who has the money to do so and the ideas.  I think if some of 
the local dj's/crews would get together and get something started that would 
be little cost to them other than their time and equipment(everyone has some 
hookups <execpt me>) something could definantly get started.  Think about 
all the solid talent that is in the area.  What if they were to try to get 
together, throw a monthly at one of the local venues.  We would undoubtedly 
have a dope party on our hands...you don't NEED lights to make a party, just 
some sound, some tables and a mixer.  They could keep all the profits and 
throw a better party next month.  Then the following...I don't make it to 
too many of the groove events because I work sat mornings, but if something 
like this were to happen and someone were trying to start something big in 
pittsburgh.  Without a doubt I'd be crawling into work the next morning.

I'm not trying to start anything negative, I'm just pointing out what I have 
noticed since I've been here.  I'm sure this is all common sense, but I 
haven't seen it in use yet.

There is definantly a beat somewhere in Pittsburgh, someone just needs to 
find out how to find our pulse.


I do want to say to those weeklies that have been running strong, big ups on 
that...you've all been doing a great job.  I wish more people would come 
out.  For a city with so many people and so many colleges there HAS to be 
more than a few hundred of us.

Peace,
J

Omni Trio makes some very detroit-ish jungle, pretty much
everything he's done is excellent. its all jungle speed though,
very few slower tracks in his catalogue. alex reese recently has
been getting all new wave and shit with his drum and bass tracks,
its pretty interesting.

What are you talking about?  You've been here 6 months,
but you don't seem to have a very good grasp of things,
that's for sure.  Maybe you spend too much time on
Loll's?  I would say that Pgh is to some extent very
DNB and Breaks oriented.  Take a look at the weeklies
that continue to successful.  There's hardly any
hardcore.  Where is this hardcore you're talking about,
except for the occasional stuff like at the Warhol and
such?

Define underground?  I wouldn't say pittsburgh is very
underground, but it's much more of an older crowd
actually.  Most events are weeklies, and mostly all of
them are 21+ or 18+.  Just cause we don't have huge
events doesn't make things underground.

Well there's not a whole lot to promote when there
aren't many "parties" going on all the time.  Parties
in pittsburgh are rare.  Most things are club/bar
nights.  Thing like Havanna or the BBT or what not that
people don't need fliers for always, because they're
consistently bringing in good music every week.  The
flyering is lax because the only things to flier for
are the weeklies and the occasional "party", and most
of those are weak attempts anyways.

True.  Some of the few things that are going on are
thrown by people who don't know what they're doing,
mostly because most of the older Pgh promoters have
learned that the Pgh crowd is too unpredictable and
unstable to throw events like that much anymore.  So
they stick to weeklies with a much more reliable crowd.
As for Wizard Workshop doing all the sound, well there
aren't many other sound companies around here, but
frankly, Wizard Workshop is the best.  Period.  People
have learned that.  So that's what they go with.  I'm
sorry if Pgh isn't like North Carolina.  Every city you
go to is gonna be different.  Maybe you should move
back to where there is TURBO SOUND, cause that's all
that's important after all, right?

Shit happens.  People fuck shit up.  It's not always
the promoter's fault, sometimes the "reliable" person
bringing the turntables shows up 2 hours late, or
sometimes the venue owner books another event in the
space right before you event and it runs over.  I
highly doubt all the parties you went to were perfect.
I'm guessing you're under 21, because it doesn't sound
like you've been to many or any of the weeklies.

This used to be the case at most parties, but like I
said, most of the reputable promoters have stopped
throwing events for one reason or another, and the
people who are doing things don't really care.

Yes, we have solid talent in the area, and guess what?
That talent is out almost every night.  Mondays @
Zythos or Pub I.G., Tuesday @ Velvet (previously) or
the PDC, Wednesdays @ Zythos or the BBT, Thursdays @
Havanna or Laga, Fridays @ Groove or Rosebud, Saturdays
@ Peter's Pub or After Hours at Touch or every other
week at Milk Records, and Sundays...shit...I don't even
remember.  You say people should pile their profits
together?  You're crazy if you think the promoters out
there are making much in the way of profits.  Most of
the promoters doing it still today are doing it because
they love it, even though they continue to lose money
or barely break even.

Yep, there's one just about EVERY night.

That's the problem with pgh....it's just too
unstable...especially the college crowd.  Most of the
Pitt kids just aren't very interested in anything,
though I would assume more of the CMU kids would come
out.  But you have to understand that while there is a
big college crowd, you're also dealing with other
competing college type activities.  Most college kids
don't really go out on weeknights on a frequent enough
basis (not til towards the end of the week) and there
are so many other bars to go to (cause you know for the
most part when they go out, they're looking to get
their drink on), a lot of them don't want to go all the
way over to the S. Side on a Monday unless they have a
driver.  It's not the promoters that are the problem,
it's unfortunately the attendees whose numbers have
been dwindling over the years.  Maybe you should try
talking to them...

As for Wizard Workshop doing all the sound, well there
aren't many other sound companies around here, but
frankly, Wizard Workshop is the best.  Period.  Get more from the Web.  F=

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Is this Pittsburgh?

I'm sorry I got you all into a bunch...Like I said, I'm not trying to start 
any drama on here.  This is just what I've noticed.  As for the hardcore 
part...there was a reply to THIS THREAD with a hardcore lineup.  Hardcore 
might not be at the weeklies but I can guarantee you a vast majority of the 
heads out here dig hardcore.

When I say underground, Pittsburgh is one of the few places that when 
parties do go down they are at un-announced locations etc.  I in no way 
inteded this to be a diss down on pittsburgh, I'm sorry you took this the 
wrong way.  I knew some people were going to get upset over this, as for the 
comment to wizard workshop....I am just ASKING if they do have turbosound 
and if they do have turbosound capablities.  I don't know if you were in a 
bad mood when you read this or not.  I'm just giving you a fresh faced 
perspective from what I've noticed.

Sorry you took this the wrong way, and I publicly appologise to anyone else 
who did.  I've had some great times in pittsburgh since I've been here, I 
just wish it would be at the potential that it could be!  There is a lot of 
SOLID talent in the city and outlying areas.  They deserve much more 
attention.

Peace...

Its says on the flyer 3 dollars for the guys, and free for the women. Like i
said, they're might have been a mishap but then again i dont know what
happend at the door. It could of been a situation where the kid was under 21
and had to pay 5 dollars to get in regardless, but then again i wasnt
there...

I dont have the flyer with me but im pretty sure its more to get in if your
under 21, which to me is understanding, considering they're having to pay
security to make sure there isnt underage drinking going on.

ok, alot of the people in pittsburgh are confused about the word 'hardcore'
-a 'hardcore raver'  who raves 28/7, goes to 3 different states in 2 days to
rave
-HAPPY HARDCORE

there are way more HAPPY HARDCORE fans here than 'grrr hardcore fans'
at of people talk about how hardcore they are and grrrrr 666 i hate you etc
etc but dont go to shows....they just feel like being angry or something.

ill never forget the stampeede of candy kids coming at me at Wish when spree
went on.  That must be the 'vast majority' of the kids claiming they are soo
hardcore \m/ rrawrrrr

I agree with someone below, you pretty much have to be 21 to enjoy yourself
in going out.

the only thing underground is what my boyfriend and i are throwing tonight.

:P

I didn't think you were trying to start drama.  I just
get annoyed when people talk about shit when they
obviously don't have a clue what they're saying.  How
can you guarentee a vast majority of the heads here dig
hardcore?  And please, give me your definition of
hardcore, so I'm clear on what music you're talking
about.  I've been living in pittsburgh for nearly 3 1/2
years now, and for the most part, the average
pittburgh partygoer knows shit about hardcore.  If you
mean happy hardcore, you should have said that
specifically.

Pittsburgh didn't be this way.  It's moved to this
trend again  for a number of reasons, one being trying
to avoid having the party shut down, trying to bring
the feeling of going to a "rave" back to parties.  This
is the way things used to be, then it went to having
parties at the same 4-5 locations for a while, and now
the few events that happen are kept secret.  If you
wanted to know if WWS had turbosound, I would have
advised you to simple ask, "Does WWS have turbosound?"
But that's not what you said.  The way you came off was
very much "I can't believe this, they suck?  Don't they
know turbosound is the coolest?"

No shit.  You don't think most of the people on this
list know that already.  They do for the most part.
The problem is everyone else.  I think the number of
people subscribed to the list are less than 600.  We
know about the talent.  We know it deserves more
respect.  The protomers would love to throw quality
events that showcase that and throw a big massive party
the way things used to be.  But the problem is, if they
tried, people just wouldn't come.  This is what I'm
saying.  You want that to change?  Don't preach to the
converted.  Educate the ignorant instead of pointing a
finger at places and people saying they should be doing
more, when they aren't the problem.  I'm sorry if I
sound like a bitch.  But ignorance and people who think
they know everything when they don't makes the bitch in
me come out and say hello. :o)

This isn't personal really.  I'm sure you're a very
nice person.  I'm a very nice person too.  But I felt
you need to be schooled.  Come out to some of the
weeklies, and if I happen to be there, feel free to say
hello.  I won't bite.  But don't act like what is going
on and the people who continue to put a lot of work
into keeping things alive around here when they would
have died long ago aren't doing shit.

Yes, I'm with Jes here Ryan, why don't you take all of your time, and all of the money in your pocket and start up a 'free' club night. only club owners can get away with that w/o getting themselves into a debt problem. and club owners aren't nice enough to give anyone a special night for free.
come on. this is reality not www.freeshite.com

Its says on the flyer 3 dollars for the guys, and free for the women. Like i
said, they're might have been a mishap but then again i dont know what
happend at the door. It could of been a situation where the kid was under 21
and had to pay 5 dollars to get in regardless, but then again i wasnt
there...

I dont have the flyer with me but im pretty sure its more to get in if your
under 21, which to me is understanding, considering they're having to pay
security to make sure there isnt underage drinking going on.

Subject: {pb-cle} Pittsburgh :: A Short Story

Pittsburgh (a Short story by Dr Edwin Rodgers aka Goose)

    I could barely hear the distant sound of scratching that entire year of
2000.  Even here in Columbus the sound was audible like the sound of a tree
branch scraping my shudders during a cold and windy February night.
Scratch.... Scratch... But what exactly was I hearing?  Was it the bitter
competition of the three promoters each throwing events on that Saturday
night?  Was it the sound of promoters fighting over potential attendees
during the flyering time when each of those parties were winding down?  Was
it the tru heads desperately atempting to find some part of the old culture
to hang on to?  To this day I remain unsure of such things, but I am sure
that following that dismal year, things changed forever.
    Even the king of the Pittsburgh promoters, Downlow, started having
problems getting the numbers for breaking even.  You could blame the 'rave'
scene downfall on many things, I personally blame it on greed.  The
promoters that were around knew what it took to throw a successful party,
and they brought in great talent.  The new school promoters attempted and
failed to jock that style.  With 4-5 parties every weekend going down it
really didnt give that feeling that what you were attending was any
different than what happened the previous weekend, or the weekend that would
come ahead.  In attempts to break even, sacrifices were made by promoters in
cutting back their budgets for sound, for lighting, visuals, and everything
that contributed to vibe.  A new crowd was promoted to in order to make
money; high schools and fraternities.  The image of raving in Pittsburgh
took a downfall, drug use increased, and promoters thrived off giving these
new demographic groups a place to puddle out for 8 hours on any given friday
or saturday.
    I mean, what did they expect?  That you could promote your party at the
local mall and not have an extremely high turnover in the raver life
expectancy cycle?  The smart promoters started to change their philosophy on
throwing parties, and slowly started moving to the clubs or not throwing
parties at all.  The only events that kept alive the old school spirit of
raving were those that were thrown as renegade parties because it really
wasnt worth 30 dollars to go to a JBrick promoted rave, it just wasnt worth
it to fight through the frat-boys, the high school etard puddles.  Who wants
to party like that and do nothing but depress yourself and exhaust your
checkbook?
    2001 was the transition year, where every week you heard the promoter
bank accounts being closed out, cashed out for good.  The new crowd was
solidifying itself, there was a new ideal in town, that of the club night.
It was not as much of a risk to have 3 or 4 performers over a 4 hour period,
because if your event bombed, you didn't lose your ass.  You could have
smaller crowds, you could have thicker vibe given that you promoted to the
proper massive.  Everyone sat around whining about the old days, about the
parties at the irish center, about the parites at venues x, y and z.  But
the masses soon accepted the inevitable.  Some stayed in the scene out of a
love for the music and the people they surround themselves with.  The high
school kids and frat boy ravers returned to their house parties and drunken
keggers.
    Acceptance became the trend, and ever since that was accomplished, the
scene has started to grow again, slowly and steadily.  Better talent has
emerged over the long-haul, there is more solidity in the events.  You know
when things happen every week, you know that they have proven themselves,
you know that the talent performing is doing it for the love.  This is why
it is so hard for this same group of people to accept criticism.  They are
the ones that lived through the hard times. They hoped and prayed for better
days, and you can see it happening.  Now it is up to all the readers of this
message to decide which side you're gonna be on.  Are you gonna support the
love of the music, or are you going to continue to complain that things aren
't better?  Instead of complaining, do something about it.  Give positive
ideas to the promoters; volunteer your time and your efforts into improving
things again.  It's coming out of the valley and there is a whole new world
out there to be explored, not just the same scenery of looking out your
kitchen window day in and day out.

Well said my friend, well said.
In a lot of ways, i think Pgh has turned out much
better talent.  The hack DJs who had been spinning in
their living rooms for a couple of months aren't around
much, and the true lovers of the music took time to
practice their craft.
I love pittsburgh, because party or not, there are
always opportunities to hear great music almost every
night of the week.  ANd that's the only thing that
should matter.

I guess the only other way i could have expanded or compared the way 'ol
school heads' are now is to calling them "Regulators"... they've seen em
come and go, and now they require that respect is earned, not given for
granted as in the mythical days of 'PLUR'... and if you challenge them, they
dont back down, they stand up for everything that they endured through to
get to this point and they wont allow it to crumble, they CAN'T allow it to
crumble, or else it would be all for naught.

I don't understand the Happy & GRRR 666 RAWWRRR \m/ relation.

Happy Hardcore, to me, is a different vibe than the rest of hardcore...

I don't listen to much of any of it so I may not know my place.

Put me in my motherfucking place. GRRR. I love Satan.

Could anybody provide me with this song, perhaps encoded digitally as a

show at milk was put on by one of my ex-pbs compatriots, and drew 
(from what ive heard) just about dick. this is after over 4 years 
of PBS/wrecked pushing hardcore techno on the city. so i have 
better things to do than waste my time on that shit.

3 ill club nights with no cover charge (not counting Velvet

Good Fridays - friday night @ the warhol museum

thats too bad that you think that. only a few short years ago when 
i was still promoting shit, we had a HOUSE PARTY that was free 
with a lineup that would make most RAVES at the time look sad (tr-
generation aka shawn rudiman live, the instigator, supa-c, etc 
etc) and got a couple hundred people. shit, i even had 
josh "pistolwhip" ryan play in a basement on the north side AFTER 
he had already played at Fabric, and it was for free. ive done 
more free shit in my life than shit that cost money, even an 
attempt at an ambient/chill/downtempo night at an Eastern Religion 
book shop just a year ago. im concentrating my efforts in other 
fields now. 

you can accomplish alot for free if you try, but i guess you 
wouldnt know that.

>1) There are no real "nights" here. It seems all the clubs play

Damn shame

i really dont know what youre talking about. 

>2) Are there underground nights in any clubs? I've been to Havana 
which was great and to this place in South Side (Zithos?) that was 
great, but no "big" clubs seem to cater to "real" dance music 
(except that 4 in 1 place that plays all hard trance).

is this a bad thing? is a good time = a big club? do you need the 
attendance of more people to justify liking this music?

>3) Is hip hop the only thing the masses move to? I like hip hop 
and all, but it seems no one has interests in anything else

huh?

>4) Is this group the general consensus of the dance music 
community in Pittsburgh? It seems the only kind of music this 
board likes is drum and bass (which I really like) and 2 step. 
Seems very close minded to anything else...no offense

okay, i see what youre talking about now. what youre saying is 
that you dont actually know anything at all. i havent even seen 2-
step MENTIONED on this board aside from the even i posted about 
last week in a long ass time, and drum and bass is rarely 
discussed. and its a fucking email list, not a message board. you 
need to wake the fuck up. 

>5) Who owns all these clubs that can be so close minded to what's 
going on in the rest of the big cities? 

who is closed minded? the people who arent interested in copying 
NYC or you for actually suggesting that someone copy NYC?

>I love this city for the most part, but I am curious if my 
obsvervations are correct.

no, theyre not. thanks, dont have a nice day. numbnuts.

Smaller crowd than i expected ~125-150... they seem to keep improving =
the sound at the venue, it sounded clearer and fuller this week.  =
Quantum had a very solid set when i got there, hearing some tracks i =
hadnt heard in a while, such as 'last night a dj saved my life' and =
'overdrive'... but i gotta say when scott henry took over the decks, it =
made the vibe thick.  there was the perfect amount of room for dancing, =
and track selection and mixing were on spot.  I met alot of new faces, =
and pretty much just chilled on the couch all night... jon fell asleep =
during henry's set, but that's nothing new, when we lived together we =
both could go to sleep with stereo's cranked, everyone always thought us =
weird for that ability.  it just really zoned both of us out, him to the =
point of relaxation... but i woke him up after about 10 minutes cause he =
was missin too much good music. heh... to all that missed it, catch him =
in another bat city at another bat time... why have i been awake since =
7:30?

Strangely, Many people who came into electronic music as I did 
(transitioned from heavy metal to hardcore and then to the rest) get into 
both happy and unhappy hardcore.  Outside of the "i'm cooler than you" 
raver world, people don't care how gay something may sound to other people, 
they just like it and listen to it.  I find it interesting how many 
metalheads I see into happyhardcore though.  I personally get similar joy 
from Eye Opener and Morbid Angel's "Caesar's Palace".

BS

Avid listener of Morbid Angel, Lenny Dee, and Brisk and Trixxy.

That "growl" stuff isnt Hardcore tho, it's Gabber.

GABBER goes "boom boom boom boom"  Gabber is NOT Hardcore


Hardcore goes 'breakbeat bassline stab kick piano ragga and so on'

Do not get your hopes to high they have Sammy O spinnig there at least three 
times per month that's kool and the other names they are bringing in. But 
it's hard to get through to anyone up there on a consistent basis to make an 
offer they know who they want and they are doing it.


They need interns handle the day to day administration of things.

I'm thinking of checking out Sphere's version.  Can't remember the 
name where it was at (begins with an A) last year but I had a good 
time.  If you remember, it was what spawned a lengthy discussion on 
quadra-sound system :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} raven maize

Raven Maize is one of Joey Negro's monkiers.  He has done two tracks under
that name:  Fascinated and The Real Life.   The real life sampled Queen's
bohemian raphsodey.  Fascinated (currently a big club hit) samples Madonna's
beautiful stranger.

Actually Joey Negro's real name is David Lee/Dave Lee.
http://www.disco-disco.com/tributes/joey.html for more info on him.  This
dude is dope.  Really amazing stuff.  He has been doing quality underground
disco/house for 10+ years and no... not the cheesy disco house stuff.  The
stuff he produces has staying power and you can play a whole set of his
stuff and not get bored.


Any other questions?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} raven maize - Matt B.

Booking Joey Negro would be extremely expensive and would not pull much of a
crowd because only DJs know who he is.  I think he uses so many different
names so that he doesn't get pigeonholed and so that his fan base stays
smaller.

Thanks, but I don't know half as much as some of the others on this list.  I
just happen to be vocal about things I do know something about.  Anything I
know comes from other people or from personal experience.  If truth be
known, Rob Black turned me on to Joey Negro... rob used to talk about him
constantly.  Rob used to play a lot of his records in the back room at
Trilogy where I used to spend much of my time getting educated in the finer
side of disco and deep house (mike metz).  That would have been around '96.
I will always remember Rob saying that the two artists he wanted to bring to
Cleveland were Joey Negro and Basement Jaxx.

One side note about Joey Negro is that many times he samples his own tracks
creating new ones.  He also has a very distinctive sound where you can
identify his style almost immediately, though that mold has somewhat been
broken in the last few years.   For pure listening pleasure, The Sunburst
Band album is really good.

Yeah, he is pretty driving most of the time.  Much of it is very happy.

DJ Dimitri's Night at the Playboy Mansion has a Sunburst Band track that is
one of my all time favorites... but it is still driving.  Some of the other
sunburst band stuff has funk to it.

icky. i dont understand why some house has to get all "driving" or 
whatever (is that the technical term?). 

the driving/pumping beat and the excessively hard beat is what 
scares me away from alot of house. and i dont count prog house as 
house, but it scares me as well. i really fucking like Moodymann, 
Theo Parrish, Africanism, Roy Davis Jr, etc. those guys are 
deeeeeeeeep house. thats what its all about.

Sounds like Pittsburgh might get a shot of nightlife in the arm...

frankly, I'm excited by this. always good to hear that movers and shakers
are willing to head down a new road.

the venue has the potential to be world class. i'd like to see it get there.

the only thing that will change with this new club, is the prices. 
As i'm sure the prices for drinks will be even more expensive to 
help the owners recoup there investment that much quicker. world 
class=overpriced in my dictionary.

hopefully the new owners will step it up and introduce a multi-room
giganto-club with super sweet top 40 trance music, a mega-oxygen-energize 
room and an over the top european trancey trance room where glowsticks are 
required!  that would be trancespectacular!  TRANCE!

of course I'm just kidding ... put your trancey flamethrowers away.

Tommy Wang is a cool guy with excellent taste.  He should do a good job with 
the place.

BFD.

world class in this city is a goddman joke. we wouldnt know world 
class if it slapped us in the face.  pittsburghers cant even 
concieve of what world class means. (its not acid washed jeans and 
80s tunes or really really bad commercial dance crap.)

i have to agree with tom on this. just getting back from berlin 
and EXPERIANCING FIRST HAND what world class clubs are. we aint 
even fucking close. the clubs here are jokes.

>now we get a world class night club. yeah right. i wonder how 
long 
>thatll last? who would want a "world class" club here anyway?

Well, it doesn't seem like much is going on in Pgh this night, so I'm
thinking of doing a little something at my place.  Nothing huge, just
friends hanging out, having a good time.  Please, people let me know
if you'd be interested in this, so I can know whether or not it's
worth it.

Hey all.   I just wanted to see what kind of response this would have.

I pay a hefty fee for running my web site: http://www.djbradanderson/

At the end of each month there is usually like 10 gigs of transfer left on 
the account (as it doesn't get many hits, oh well, gotta have it though).   
given that it's payed for, how would everone like some mix sets from my 
collection?   There would be a download limiter on it so first come first 
server.   Each file would be about 150 megs...   limit to like 20-25 or 
something.

I was thinking some Basement Jaxx or Cut & Paste, possibly Judge Jules would 
be a good first choice.   Let me know if people are interested.   Just reply 
back to me with a really good one liner joke which is optional (of course).   
I might post the best ones.   lol.

Enjoy the snowy and ice filled holidays everyone.   Stay safe and have fun.

the Communist Party in China.
  
  HU'S ON FIRST
  By James Sherman
  
  (We take you now to the Oval Office.)
  
  George: Condi! Nice to see you. What's happening?

  Condi: Sir, I have the report here about the new leader of China.

  George: Great. Lay it on me.

  Condi: Hu is the new leader of China.
 
  George: That's what I want to know.

  Condi: That's what I'm telling you.

  George: That's what I'm asking you. Who is the new leader of China?

  Condi: Yes.

  George: I mean the fellow's name.

  Condi: Hu.

  George: The guy in China.

  Condi: Hu.

  George: The new leader of China.

  Condi: Hu.

  George: The Chinaman!

  Condi: Hu is leading China.

  George: Now whaddya' asking me for?

  Condi: I'm telling you Hu is leading China.

  George: Well, I'm asking you. Who is leading China?

  Condi: That's the man's name.

  George: That's who's name?

  Condi: Yes.

  George: Will you or will you not tell me the name of the new
leader of 
China?

  Condi: Yes, sir.

  George: Yassir? Yassir Arafat is in China? I thought he was in
the Middle 
  East.

  Condi: That's correct.

  George: Then who is in China?

  Condi: Yes, sir.

  George: Yassir is in China?

  Condi: No, sir.

  George: Then who is?

  Condi: Yes, sir.

  George: Yassir?

  Condi: No, sir.

  George: Look, Condi. I need to know the name of the new leader
of China.
  Get me the Secretary General of the U.N. on the phone.

  Condi: Kofi?

  George: No, thanks.

  Condi: You want Kofi?

  George: No.

  Condi: You don't want Kofi.

  George: No. But now that you mention it, I could use a glass of
milk. And
  then get me the U.N.

  Condi: Yes, sir.

  George: Not Yassir! The guy at the U.N.

  Condi: Kofi?

  George: Milk! Will you please make the call?

  Condi: And call who?

  George: Who is the guy at the U.N?

  Condi: Hu is the guy in China.

  George: Will you stay out of China?!

  Condi: Yes, sir.

  George: And stay out of the Middle East! Just get me the guy at
the U.N.

  Condi: Kofi.

  George: All right! With cream and two sugars. Now get on the phone.
  (Condi picks up the phone.)

  Condi: Rice, here.

  George: Rice? Good idea. And a couple of egg rolls, too. Maybe
we should
  send some to the guy in China. And the Middle East. Can you get
Chinese
  food in the Middle East?

Spy is having an Asian/Relaxation theme for new years.  Body massages and
things like that.  I will be spinning, and I can get more details out if you
wish.  NYE is a huge event @ Spy.  I'm guessing $50 cover with an open bar
until 11... but I could be wrong.  I'll ask Nikki.

I know they asked me to play @ Peabody's, but I had to turn em down due to
Spy.  I am guessing that they are going for an all local lineup, with many
oldschool names alongside their battle winners.   I'll ask them as well.

Racine, Wisconsin: "Disorderly House" Citations First Day in Court

On Monday, December 2nd, the first 206 of 441 persons cited for attending a November 2nd, benefit concert in Racine Wisconsin were scheduled to enter pleas in court. In an attempt to dissuade individuals from challenging the $968 citations in court, Daniel Wright, the City Attorney for Racine, offered to reduce fines to $100 for anyone who pled "no contest." Mr. Wright made it clear that the deal would not apply to anyone who challenged the citations in court and subsequently lost, they would have to pay the full $968 amount.

But only 19 people took the city attorney up on his offer and pled "no contest." More than 70% (147) of those who appeared in court pled "not guilty" and demanded trials! Another 40 individuals failed to appear in court and were found "guilty" by default.

Last week the ACLU of Wisconsin urged the Racine City Attorney to dismiss the disorderly house citations "in the interest of resolving this matter quickly and avoiding a tremendous waste of public resources." If a similar percentage of the remaining 235 persons scheduled to appear in court on December 9th and 16th plea "not guilty" the City Attorney's office will face the logistical nightmare of having to prepare and try hundreds of cases.

The City of Racine will likely be forced to hire a special prosecutor to work full time on the disorderly house cases, police officers called to testify in court will likely be paid overtime - unless police services in the community are to suffer, and additional court staff may have to be hired. In all, the City of Racine may need to try 300+ people.

EM: DEF STRONGLY URGES ALL THOSE CITED TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS AND CHALLENGE THESE MERITLESS CITATIONS.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} metropol closing

metropol a world class club?  hmmmm... i've got to think on that one.  i 
would have to agree with shawn that not even when it first opened was 
metropol what i thought to be 'world class'.

but i do remember when it opened that it was the most kickass thing this 
city had ever seen.  it really was incredibly different and, i think, 
forced all of the other clubs in pittsburgh to change what they were 
doing.  however, while other places changed, metropol didn't keep a step 
ahead and eventually got left behind.  it's a shame, but it's 
inevitable.  studio 54 only lasted for about 6 years and metropol has had 
15.  that seems to be about the rule for most big clubs though... to 
re-invent themselves every 5 or 6 years.

some really incredible things in my life happened in that club... i'm going 
to miss it.

Subject: {pb-cle} NYE plans (Havana)

Those looking to just get their drink on -
Club Havana is providing a 5 hour open bar for only $40 per person.
($75 per couple)
9pm to 2am / Dec. 31st. / Free Food / Free champagne

(at Havana prices, this is a sweet deal)

If enough interest is shown (and enough presale tickets are sold) I might be 
able to get them to consider having DJs for the night.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: real bombing footage from iraq on 12-06

dude that was from back in Jan or feb when I was still in the 
marines...haha... Thats Ghanny...not iraq.   Actually the gunmen on that 
bird were doing some pretty f'd up shit.  Did you see the guys they were 
mowing down.  AC-130 Gunships are NASTY...bad news... it's a modified C-130 
transport bird with a TON of VERY big guns on one side.  It's one of the 
most heavily used planes in our arsenal.  Bless your soul if you have on of 
those puppies trolling over your head.

peace,
J

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Mon Dec 23                         ARRIVAL                           Toledo

GlassCity Records Presents:
*Arrival*
Monday, December 23rd 2002
Toledo, Ohio
Robert Armani - Chicago - Techno - High Octane

When you put the words "Chicago" and "Techno" together one man comes to
mind, Robert Armani! The south side "Crown Royal Funksta" has been a
techno staple for the last decade and his discography puts him in a league
all his own. On his first trip to spin in Italy he realized his true
calling while studying to be a Chicago Police officer (we almost lost
him). Just the mention of "Blow It Out", "Burn Out", "Big Dick", "Playing
With a Rubber Band", "Ambulance", and, of course, "Circus Bells", brings
back memories of dancing to them over the past ten years at rave parties
and in clubs all around the world. Dance Mania, ACV, Dust Traxx,
Djax-Up-Beats, and High Octane are the labels where his music has been
released and his remixes of JB3 (Joey Beltram), Paul Johnson, Dave Clarke,
Blake Baxter, Armando, and even Gary Numan have elevated him to the
highest of heights. With sixteen full length album releases and over sixty
single releases it has been hard to avoid Mr. Armani's work while flippin'
through any techno bin. His relentless tour schedule has him on the road
non-stop and his hard hitting, dirty, Chicago Techno has rocked clubs
since his early days of spinning. This is a man of Techno royalty and we
are happy to live under his reign.

Translucent - Chicago - House/Techno - Transparent, DTX 

Translucent, also known as Jason Torres, has been playing and studying
music for over sixteen years. Having been influenced by jazz artists such
as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Charlie Parker, Jason started playing
the trumpet and piano at a young age. His dedication to music earned him a
full jazz scholarship to the prestigious Roosevelt University in Chicago
where, in 1994, he was influenced by another style of music known as House
Music. Jason then began DJing and started something new and fresh in the
dance community: playing live trumpet while spinning records, combining
the elements of live jazz with electronic music. Noticing that Jason had
something special, Paul Johnson, the creator of the gold record "Get, Get
Down," helped Jason create connections in Chicago. Since then, Translucent
has played live trumpet with such greats as Derrick Carter, Timo Maas,
Mark Farina, Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr., Glenn Underground,
Cajmere, Boo Williams, Carlos, and Halo. Recent recording projects include
Glenn Underground's new album on Guidance, work with Derrick Carter on
classic, and Gene Farris on Fluential.

DBN.NYE : uber tradition!
(we got your tradition right here)
 

die konzept : (ie. what's in a name?)

zehn : German for the number 10. Why German? This is Milwaukee!

synchronicity : Non-local, non-linear connections between all things and 
places and times.

zehnchronicity : It's no coincidence this 10th annual New Years Eve event

electronic music (r)evolution
(click the * to learn more about a specific performer)

 
ESP Woody McBride Live!
Minneapolis : Communique USA, Bush, Drop Bass Network *
That's right, live! Back in the day Woody and his mighty 303's could be 
spotted here and there, but then the gear went into the studio and never 
came back out...until now. Kicking off his "I'm Psychic You Know..." World 
Tour with his first live performance in our part of the Midwest since Even 
Furthur '96. An hour and a half of wowie-zowie, tripped-out, 
heart-pounding original techno and acid in the tradition of submission to 
the great cosmic energy. Make sure to check out www.djesp.com for info 
about his new on some of the most exciting labels in techno.
Starscream aka #0 from
Des Moines : www.SoundProofCoalition.com, DVS, Matix, Vestax *
Lord almighty! The dj from the most extreme band in heavy metal is coming 
to rock you like a hurricane with insane turntablist skills. His sights 
are locked in on Milwaukee, ready to drop the drum-n-bass and raga like 
you've never heard it before.
Punisher
Detroit : Seismic, Reload, Matrix *
Back by popular demand! Last spring she came out and worked over everyone 
at underground, inc. with an unbelievable set of bangin' beats. This time 
the pint-sized pocket of precise mixing has some new tricks in store for 
another techno lashing.
House Preservation Society
Mystic Bill and Davey Dave
Chicago *
This veteran pair of Windy City all stars has been banging the box 
non-stop since the early days of warehouse and loft parties. United once 
again for a then and now taste of Chicago house music. You not only want 
it, you need it!
Baseck
Los Angeles/Milwaukee : Darkmatter, tigerbeat6, Massive Record Source
When Doormouse left the Midwest for sunnier skies, the Midwest Hardcorps 
faithful were left wondering were they would get their fix. The answer was 
Baseck! Blistering broken beats and anything else that is hard to the 
core; you know the score.
Feather
San Diego : Native:State, uvart.org *
Part psychedelic shaman, part performer, and part artist acting as a 
trance channel bringing forth light, oneness, and unity through the sounds 
of funky goa. Riding the flow, he has reached the masses from the SoCal 
deserts to the Burning Man festival.
Joe Vor-Tech
Brooklyn : Brooklyn Underground, Synthetic Men
Straight from the electroclash ground zero. This sassy underground music 
movement fuses the punk-inspired retro sounds of 80's new wave, synth pop, 
and electro with fashion and art to create a new music future that you 
can't help but enjoy.
TJ Richter
Inner Space : mindplasma.net *
A hyper-kinetic goblin of fun presenting a pulsating plasma of spoken 
word, light, and sound with mega-bass from outer space that flattens 
Discovery World like road kill, SQUOOSH!
Mega/Blast Fhresh
featuring J-Slim, Red Shift, and Baseck
Milwaukee : Addict, Massive Record Source
The artist formerly known as Heep Hup Fresssh. This DJ team uses sick-ass 
turntablism to create cool crunchy hip-hop soundscapes from bass, breaks, 
bleeps, and noise.

Midwest Technoclash
Expect nothing short of an all-out techno royal rumble when you take three 
of the Midwest's favorite dj's and add multiple 1200's with a barrage of 
effects.

Rusty Habitz
Milwaukee : Drop Bass Network, WBA *
versus
Wobbler
Appleton : Drop Bass Network, Garbagegame
versus
Mike G
Minneapolis : Intellephunk
Phuzze
Milwaukee : Poopiehead, Trounce Records *
In a rare hometown appearance, his masterful mixing and euphoric trance 
will simply move you.
Lush
Beloit : Poopiehead, Soulmates *
Saturating your spirit and making it soar with the sound of jazz-infected 
soulful house.
Diva D
Madison : Poopiehead Productions *
Queen of the decks, combining a passion for spinning with a wicked 
drum-n-bass selection.
Urbane
Madison : Cataclysmic, Well Known Djs *
Integrating hardcore and dark drum-n-bass, the result is guaranteed 
dancefloor devastation.
Michael Wenz
Milwaukee : Artist Underground, Raving Lunatiks
If the sound of acid techno is your thing, submit your soul to the 
archangel Wenzebub.
Angelus
Riverwest : Drop-A-Log, Wheeled
A fixture in Milwaukee clubbing, he's been known to bump the house time 
and time again.
Citch Mantrall
Hustisford : Ecstatic
A rural WI regular, gaining recognition for his mix of high-energy trance 
and hard house.

Sat Jan 25                      BUBBLE BOBBLE                    Central OH

Monster Productions presents...
Bubble Bobble <><>The Bubble Party<><>
Sat Jan 25th 2003
Central, OH
Admission: $15
>From the people who brought you B2S, the 12 hour, $4 parti in downtown... 
Justice, bringing warehouse parties back to Columbus... Back 2 Skool 2, 
keeping the columbus parti scene alive for only $6.... Bubble Bobble. This 
is an fundraiser for a HUGE event in the summer of 2003. This will have 
bubble machines running all night long!
TALENT:
Kevin Reynolds: Live Pa/Techno - Detroit, MI
Kevin is one of the best Techno artist that has ever came across the 
Mid-West and Detroit. His Funky and exhilerating style produced live will 
keep you dancing.
Thomas James: Residual Recordings - Deep House/Min. Techno - Columbus, OH
Thomas James is co-owner, with Titonton Duvante, of Residual Recordings. 
Founded in 1998, Residual is recognized worldwide for it's consistent deep 
house, and melodic techno grooves. The impressive Residual discography
boasts releases by accomplished artists such as Boo Williams, John Tejada, 
Dan Curtin, Fabrice Lig, Todd Sines and Titonton. As a DJ, Thomas James is 
known for his impecable taste in deep house, melodic and minimal techno. 
His track selection inspires and his skill motivates. Thomas has held 
residencies at Axis (Columbus), Club 504 (Columbus), Touch (Cleveland) and 
is currently half the force behind columbus' first all live electronic 
monthly event, Proceed. As host of these evenings, international caliber 
guests have included Kit Clayton, Glenn Underground, DJ Swamp, Dan Bell, 
John Tejada, Robert Hood and Hannah to name a few. Future plans include 
new 
releases on Residual, and another return to Europe where he's played in 
Switzerland and Spain.
JJ BOOGIE: www.wellknowndjs.com / www.groovereactor.com Groovereactor - 
Trance & House - Cincinnati, OH
A veteran behind the decks now in his 7th year, JJ BOOGIE
is one of the names to watch in 2003. Having been booked all over the US 
and in Canada - look for a fresh set of the top dance tracks you will ever 
hear. His peak time sets create an amazing energy and you can expect the 
whole room to be dancing non-stop. He's now touring to support the release 
of his recent mixed CD - GENESIS and his upcoming vinyl album on his own 
Groove Reactor Records.
Quantum: Mythodic/CEG/Ritual - House/Progressive - Columbus, OH
To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.
Nostalgic: Downtown Entertainment - Funky Breaks - Dayton, OH
Aus-10: Ascension DJ's - Intelligent DNB - Columbus, OH
NautiKat: Ascension DJ's - Female UK Hard House/Trance - Columbus, OH
Oompaloompa: Airplane Clique - Trance - Norwood, OH
Glennard Skynard: so real ent. - HHC - Columbus, OH

*this is just a teaser*

titonton will be hosting a monthly broken beat night at standard lounge
starting in january.  complete details cannot be released at this time, but
i can say that it will feature (at least) one motherfucker representing that
crazy shit.  i'll post info on here soon.  you can also keep an eye on
http://www.titonton.com once it gets updated next week.

if all goes well you can expect people like afronaught and dego appearing in
this cozy upscale lounge once a month.  life is good.

Yup....

Trust me the govt wouldn't let any bombing footage out of Iraq at this 
point.  Esp as dirty as those guys were getting wiping out people with 
howitzers and 50 cals.

See, that's what I thought as soon as I saw the subject line...

Like, OK, you can get Harry Potter from the news groups, but this ain't no
Harry Potter, man....someone would have to make a concerted effort and risk
some SERIOUS jail time to get this thing into a format for distribution on
the internet...

The US Armed Forces aren't exactly the RIAA when it comes to leaks of their
best material....they CAN make your ass disappear in a cloud of smoke.

actually, i used to make the drive from c-bus to the burg twice a month
years back.  its a bit long, but scenic.  its really nice in the winter too
as long as the roads aren't bad.

trust me tom, you're gonna want to make it out for this.  the venue really
nice and the sound system (although not top-notch) is waaaaaay better than
touch in cleveland.

scenic? are trees scenic? it makes me wanna fall asleep. i wont 
make the drive in the dark anymore, it puts me right to sleep. i 
used to do it pretty often back in 98-99 or so, but since then i 
think ive been down there twice, both times this year and both 
times i wanted to cry. getting to soniq's house in buttfuck 
whereverhelives was especially painful.

touch's best part is the intimate space (which jwan and i have 
blamed on the low low ceiling) plus the amount of heads plus the 
great music. it all adds up. but ill be there no matter what man. 
im excited.

Subject: {pb-cle} Goldie:  Shutting down the drama

I know this wasn't a topic here, but many of you who have heard the shit
being spoken.

The Cleveland Goldie show on Dec. 27th is _%100_ confirmed.  Phareal
productions are legit.

At the store we were sick of hearing all the stories people were telling...
and here is what we found out:

"just got off the phone with the agent. he's PISSED! he said the show is on
at xxxxxxxxx. He said the promoter paid 100% up front. he was really upset
to hear people are bashing him. the agent said he hates Cleveland politics.
he gets emails from a ton of "kandy ravers" from cleveland talking shit. "

So shut down the shit talking now.   When booking agents get pissed because
of rumors in the Clevelend scene it hurts everyone.

My opinion, anyhow.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Goldie:  Shutting down the drama

Sorry to put that out like that, or if it wasn't clear.  There are two
parties the night of the 27th, and Bass and Lace was the first one announced
and listed and the Goldie show.  Many people were claiming the goldie show
was not legit. Just because its a new promoter that doesn't mean the show is
bunk.  So many people are saying "well goldie's website says he is in miami"
on that date or other such drama.  One phone call put to the booking agent
cleared up that gossip.   It certainly does suck that one promoter has made
an investment in a show only to have another another promoter come along and
do something on the same night, but that is only indicative of the division
that is going on within the Cleveland scene.  If I go out that night, it
will be to Bass and Lace only because I promised the promter that I would
try.  Additionally, Boomer's party Bass and Lace (aka 23:59:02) was
originally slated for NYE and he moved it to accomodate everyone else's NYE
plans.  I just want people to know that its cool to want to support your
friends, but gossip only hurts everyone.  Rather than focusing on any
negative, it is better to focus on the positive.  It keeps more people
interested in going out and it keeps things progressing.  Thanks for
reading.

I think this is why people are second guessing the booking...

www.goldie.co.uk
or...
http://www.trustthedj.com/goldie/appearances
it links to the same site.

I really don't know if the site is wrong or not... I hope so, because
I've never seen him play live.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Goldie: Shutting down the drama

Sorry to put that out like that, or if it wasn't clear.  There are two
parties the night of the 27th, and Bass and Lace was the first one
announced
and listed and the Goldie show.  Many people were claiming the goldie
show
was not legit. Just because its a new promoter that doesn't mean the
show is
bunk.  So many people are saying "well goldie's website says he is in
miami"
on that date or other such drama.  One phone call put to the booking
agent
cleared up that gossip.   It certainly does suck that one promoter has
made
an investment in a show only to have another another promoter come along
and
do something on the same night, but that is only indicative of the
division
that is going on within the Cleveland scene.  If I go out that night, it
will be to Bass and Lace only because I promised the promter that I
would
try.  Additionally, Boomer's party Bass and Lace (aka 23:59:02) was
originally slated for NYE and he moved it to accomodate everyone else's
NYE
plans.  I just want people to know that its cool to want to support your

Subject: {pb-cle} *philly girl invading your side of the state!* :) <3 :) 

hey beauteous ravers/partykids/promoters/others!

my name is Lori.  some of you may know me from the north east raves list where i reside as the ROM manager. :) i've been partying for about 3 years now. i'm located in philly, and usually rock out in that area.  this friday (december 20th), my boyfriend and i are going to be coming over to your side of the state to visit his family, and we're looking for parties. :) i signed on to this list hoping to A.) meet some new peeps, B.) continuously expand my knowledge of our culture, and C.) find a party or two to hit up while we're there.

about us: i'm 21 and sean is 27, so age restrictions are not an issue for us.  we are not drg addicts.  we will not be doing e, speed, coke, heroine, or anything like that at the party. if there are substances for sale by the partythrowers like alcohol or No2, we won't go overboard and will not end up on the floor. we are extremely responsible, reputable people and will not cause any problems. we attend almost all of philly's undergrounds and can provide references to let you know that we're not narcs, addicts, or anything else that would harm the vibe of the party. we prefer parties that don't have dresscodes-- i wear candy and sean wears tshirts, big pants, sneakers and a hat. we would like to not have to alter our state of dress to attend a party. we prefer parties that are not in clubs, but we will consider attending a party in a club as long as its relatively "ravey" and the lineup is nice.  we especially dig psytrance and breaks, or anything live PA, but we also like techno, jungle, and some house and trance. we're quite open minded about music. we prefer parties that are less than $20. we'l be going to a town that's basically equidistant from erie and p-burgh, so we welcome any event on that side of the state. if any of you peeps have any events to suggest, or need more info about us, lemme know! :) party safe, pittsburgh! :) <3 :) 

oh yeah, and while i'm at it, anyone care to give me an overview of the p-burgh area scene? i've never been over there, so let me know the things you think i need to know before coming! :) party hard but safely! :) i hope to see some of you out on the dancefloors! :) <3 :) 

P.L.U.R.R. :)

Do you think you guys could permanently move to Pittsburgh?

Subject: {pb-cle} new years eve

we're doing a free little jammy at the milk space.  everyone is bringing
their 5 favorite records and playing them one person after the next. 
should be fun in combination with lots of alcohol.  and metropol is right
across the alley.  alex is back in town to play there + it looks like
there's lots of hip hop and house besides.  i'm pretty excited about the
simple stumble across the alley necessary to enjoy both parties.

i'll post details on our deal soon...

BAD BOY BILL ~ Chicago
STEVE SMOOTH ~ Chicago
PAULY ~ New York
DVS ~ Pittsburgh

Admission: $15

CLUB LAGA
3609 Forbes Ave


DJ. Artist. Producer. Songwriter. Entrepreneur. Chicago's Bad Boy Bill
transcends the role of the average superstar DJ. With Bangin' The Box,
Vol. 5, the latest installment in Bill's top-selling mix CD series whose
sales have eclipsed the 100,000 plateau per release on Mix Connection
Multimedia (the label which Bill co-owns with partner and long time friend
Michael Ryden), he reaffirms that passion and versatility elicit success.

"Musically, I've been playing both funky house and harder tracks," says
Bill, a veteran global road warrior who averages over 150 DJ gigs
annually. "This CD is a mixture of various musical styles, which is where
I'm at with my live DJ sets right now."

The energy that Bill brings to every club, party and mega-event can be
found in the red-hot grooves on Bangin' The Box, Vol. 5, which is
comprised of 34 banging tracks culled from deep in the dance underground.
Vol. 5 is a noteworthy feat in Bill's career because it contains two
original Bad Boy Bill productions: "Happy" featuring Kevin Irving, a
Chicago house vocalist whose history dates back to the DJ International
days and "Everybody" featuring vocals by Alex Peace.

"I have some tracks that I've completed for my debut original music album
which will drop next year," says Bill, "and I wanted to feature a couple
of them on the mix CD to let people have a taste of what I've been working
on."

Like his live sets, Bangin' The Box, Vol. 5 attacks the senses. When Bill
is on the decks, he's constantly working the mixer's faders and EQs,
soundly tweaking each record by scratching, cutting and using his
technical know-how in order to take his dance floor one step closer to
nirvana.

Spinning the crowd into a dancing frenzy is Bill's motivation. "The payoff
for me is seeing people dancing and having a great time during my set," he
humbly admits as he continues to make the masses go wild for his
unmistakable style of live remixes. "My DJ style originated with the idea
to remix a song live with two copies of the same record and then combine
scratching and hip-hop techniques with house grooves."

One of America's most in-demand DJs on the North American club and dance
music scene, Bill has also nurtured quality dance music as one of the
principles behind Mix Connection, whose subsidiary labels IHR and Moody
are responsible for releasing Hatiras' dance floor anthem "Spaced Invader"
and Paul Johnson's global smash "Get Get Down," respectively. "It's a
great position to be in," says Bill. "We're taking a long-term approach
for my career and for the development of the entire label and artist
roster. When it comes to artwork, photography or a music video, we are
always looking to bring it to the next level."

In spite of all of his accomplishments, Bill remains modest, levelheaded
and positively motivated about his direction. "I am always thinking about
the future."

Forget old school and new school. Bad Boy Bill is the leader of the next
school.

Subject: {pb-cle} 'keep it deep' shirts


tom and i have embarked on a cooperative effort to make the 'keep it deep'
tshirt idea come to being.  it should be noted that dr. jason osmotic was
in on the ground floor of the operation.

the shirt will feature the image of barry white on the front, with 'keep
it deep' on the back (tasteful, simple, small font).  the "shirt lady" is
printing up a few different color combinations and we'll be choosing later
in the week.  we're trying for a black shirt (no, not periwinkle like the
pb-cle shirt, traut ;p) with white ink, although we've been warned that
barry might end up looking like an x-ray.  so, that's still up for
discussion..

the shirts will be $10 or less and will be in our possession sometime
between christmas and new years eve.  email me if you'd like to pre-order.
 can't guarantee you'll get one if you don't speak up now.  these babies
will be the hot ticket into any holiday party.

specify sizes - adult s-xxl, girls baby-t s-l, or long sleeve adult s-xxl
(will be a couple bucks extra)

Musician to make album of sex noises

An electronic musician from Winnipeg, Canada is making an album out of the noises he and his partner make during sex.

Aaron Funk and his girlfriend Rachael Kozak recorded their love-making sessions on mini-disk.

Funk, who normally records under the name Venetian Snares, sampled the noises and turned them into music.

The album, to be called Nymphomatriarch, is due to be released next year.

"People I've played it for don't believe it," Funk told a forthcoming issue of Playboy.

"They're like: "No, no, no - you've sampled high hats there, I know it." It's essentially alchemy, shaping sex

into a new form.

"It's weird to deconstruct the sounds of sex. It makes you conscious of a lot of stuff you'd normally ignore. I remember thinking, like, oh, that slap will make a good snare drum.

"Or, wow, that was a freakish set of grunts and moans - I want to make that into a choir later."

Songs completed so far include Hymen Tramp Choir, Pervs, and Blood on the Rope.

Wouldnt mind seeing Gold Chains.  There is something awkward about his music but sometimes when Im in the right mood its GRAVY!
Ahh, I see the third record in Otto's Chopped Zombie Fungus is soon to be out.  The first two are great and both cases are on my walls because the artwork is so RAD!  
Speaking of Schematic.  Local cat Hearts of Darkness from Cleveland who is part of the Cleveland Connection alongside So Red, Girltalk, and Andriu,  just got signed to Schema and is looking at a full LP for his debut because they love all his tracks and cant decide on just a few for a smaller EP.  He just played the first show with the Schema crew in Miami around Thanksgiving.  Congrats to Frank!  Pretty rad to land a deal with the biggest US electronica label right off the bat for your first release.
Helen!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} VSnares like you've never heard him ;)

some friends that were in a punk band taped one of the members having 
sex in the bathroom of their house with a mic under the door.....  (FYI, 
plasticman--no, no relation to plastikman)
they then were working on a song that used the tape played at original 
speed, by playing along with it.  i don't know what ever evolved out of 
that if anything.

I know what you mean, got to have something to keep you sane at work sometimes.  I usually bounce around these three different "stations":
groovetech.com - live shows, also check out archives
shoutcast.com - not a large selection, but quality once in a while
live365.com - a motherload of stations for just about any genre, electronic or not
Hope this helps!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Goldie: Shutting down the drama


Phareal productions has been around a while, i remember them colaborating 
with teknova several years ago, late 90s.  Guessing those are the same folk. 
  Good to see lava resident dj Chris Pulse on the lineup too.  hes always 
lay'n down quality music.  This show sounds like a holliday treat for real.

is this Goldies first appearance in cleveland?

http://pbcle.chemlab.org/archives/list/html/2002.12/msg00335.php

are the two posts regarding the topic.


People were talking shit about the goldie show.  We got sick of it and
called the agent to verify.  I posted exactly what the agent said -- the
promoter paid %100 up front.  I would not have done this other than we had
to hear 10+ people tell us how "golide is not comming" so the best thing to
do was verify it so the BS would stop. The guys promoting goldie are
probably working hard and don't need raver drama.   Similarily, Boomer
announced his show first and doesn't need the raver drama either.  If we
keep the bullshit rumours out of it, then both parties will do well.  My
opinion anyhow.  Hope that re-iterates.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Goldie bashing

I didn't think of it that way.  Calling the agent was easy and quick and the
person who made the call is a good friend of theirs.  When you have 10+
people comming at you talking shit, it seemed like calling the definative
source was the easiest way to put an end to the verbal abuse.  I don't know
the promoter, and if that caused him any grief I'm sorry.  I really didn't
think that would be a bad thing.  For what its worth, I ran into Chris Green
@ pressure sunday and the show is definately on the up and up.  PLUS,
checking up on things makes hopefully will help reduce the amount of email
that the agent was getting about it. Maybe I should not even have brought it
up, but we haven't had many events lately... and when we do I have to hear
so much shit talked that I am trying to do my _best_ to take an active stand
against it.  I really wish we had a promoters organization again.

yeah in case you all slept (which i know you did, even though i
reminded you the night before it got released domestically) ive
been hyping up this record since i got it before it even dropped
in the UK. its definitely one of the top 3 albums of the year. i
wouldnt call it hiphop, but the guy is definitely the only white
emcee whom i truly like everything he's done. he's witty as hell,
smart as fuck, and his beats are tight. check it out.

years back spelled their name "Phryl"

I doubt they would scrap the spelling after people knew them for years.

Phareal is new I'll wager.

Phareal productions has been around a while, i remember them colaborating 
with teknova several years ago, late 90s.  Guessing those are the same folk. 
  Good to see lava resident dj Chris Pulse on the lineup too.  hes always 
lay'n down quality music.  This show sounds like a holliday treat for real.

is this Goldies first appearance in cleveland?

Word.

My man in NYC has been ordering me to get this anyway i can, and I slept.

Heard a track on Edge of the X (of all places...go figure) Sunday night, and
I've been kicking myself since.

This is good shit. It won't be big in America because he very clearly has no
interest in being, acting, or gaining acceptance from a black audience.

And his beats sounded pretty hot...

yeah in case you all slept (which i know you did, even though i
reminded you the night before it got released domestically) ive
been hyping up this record since i got it before it even dropped
in the UK. its definitely one of the top 3 albums of the year. i
wouldnt call it hiphop, but the guy is definitely the only white
emcee whom i truly like everything he's done. he's witty as hell,
smart as fuck, and his beats are tight. check it out.

Fuck candy ravers.

the people of whom you speak are *NOT* candy ravers. true candy ravers are not disrespectful.  true candy ravers wouldn't do anything to harm someone's party.  true candy ravers would get all the facts before speaking out negatively.  the people who said mean things to goldie's agent/promoter are *NOT* candy ravers. candy is a way of living, not just a dresscode. in order to be a candy raver, one must embrace PLURR (peace-love-unity-respect-responsibility) to the best of his or her ability. it was non-peaceful, non-loving, non-unified, disrespectful, and irresponsible for those people to throw out insults before getting the true facts. people who don't embrace PLURR are not entitled to call themselves candy ravers, or to be labeled as such. the people of whom you speak are certainly not candy ravers by any means.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Goldie bashing

I think the root of this rumor has more to do with Goldie's history of no showing events rather than any kind of drama or shit talking on behalf of Cleveland people.  But, if you look at Goldie's history of no shows coupled with a new new promoter that no one has ever heard of and a flyer that looks as though it was thrown together in 2 minutes, it is a good basis for anyone to be skeptical of an event.  With all the shady, fly-by night promoters (and even some of the more established names who raped the scene for their own gain) Cleveland has seen over the years, people have a right to be skeptical.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Goldie bashing

Well said George.

I agree that people have a right to be skeptical for the reasons you said.
Given that we are at a low point in the history of the Cleveland area scene,
I think anyone throwing a shady event will burn out very quickly.  I still
wish I would not have stepped up to say anything at all.

> I think the root of this rumor has more to do with Goldie's history of no
showing events rather than any kind of drama or shit talking on behalf of
Cleveland people.  But, if you look at Goldie's history of no shows coupled
with a new new promoter that no one has ever heard of and a flyer that looks
as though it was thrown together in 2 minutes, it is a good basis for anyone
to be skeptical of an event.  With all the shady, fly-by night promoters
(and even some of the more established names who raped the scene for their
own gain) Cleveland has seen over the years, people have a right to be
skeptical.

really i dont think thats why he wont get big, i think its because
he has no interest in gaining acceptance from an AMERICAN
audience. he is accepted by all folks in the UK, the underground
garage label Locked On discovered him almost 2 years ago now, and
the garage audience is quite diverse. he's just too damn english
for mainstream success here, unlike daniel "chipmunk" beddinfield. 

>And his beats sounded pretty hot...

he does all kinds of beats, hiphop, garage, jungle, dub (sampling
the specials even), etc. the intro track has one of the best
string sections ive heard in a minute. and he does it all on his
laptop. off the hook.

Our trip was different. It was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character; a gross, physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country. But only for those with true grit...
and we are chock full of that, man!

Still one of my all time top 5 favorite hip hop albums HAS to be Z-Trip and
Radar Live @ FuturePrimitive Soundsession.

All kinds of old school beats on there that are just so damn funky. It's
easily the most danceable turntablism album i've ever heard.

<<ha. the x is some comic shit, man. go get the fucking CD! >>

Well, the only reason I even listened that long was cause in a one hour
span, they played that track and Dan The Automator's "Bear Witness 3"

Speaking of good hip hop....

<<really i dont think thats why he wont get big, i think its because he has
no interest in gaining acceptance from an AMERICAN
audience.>>

Touche. Fair enough.

<<he is accepted by all folks in the UK, the underground garage label Locked
On discovered him almost 2 years ago now, and
the garage audience is quite diverse.>>

And I find it odd that Atlantic Records has picked up both he and Craig
David. And we all know what happened there....

If he stays real, I'd say he maybe puts one more album out on a major
American label.

<<he's just too damn english for mainstream success here, unlike daniel
"chipmunk" beddinfield.>>

I guess I'm the only person who slept on that song. Didn't hear it until it
was already old news, and it wasn't all that.

<<he does all kinds of beats, hiphop, garage, jungle, dub (sampling the
specials even),>>

Dub? I thought they were primarily ska...

<<etc. the intro track has one of the best string sections ive heard in a
minute. and he does it all on his laptop. off the hook.>>

Someday, i will be that guy.

BTW, Tom, my PC crashed two weeks ago. I'm muddling through with an Athlon
650 until I can build the new pimp system.

They did earlier this year right? Or was that Radar?

Anyways, I totally agree.

Our trip was different. It was to be a classic affirmation of everything 
right and true in the national character; a gross, physical salute to the 
fantastic possibilities of life in this country. But only for those with 
true grit...
and we are chock full of that, man!

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Congrats Groove

Uneasy Listening is great, but I am totally blown away by Product Placement. 
Actually I think that Goose's idea of involving some aspects of hypnotism 
sorta parallels whats going on in Product Placement.

They take parts of jingles, which have been implanted in our minds to evoke 
specific responses, thanks to 'talented' marketing professionals. Z-Trip and 
Radar then repetitively push ideas that are contrary to what we have 
learned. Presumably to reprogram or something. One that stands out is the 
sounds of a refreshing beverage, fizzing and pouring over a glass of ice. 
Then insert the jingle phrase "Its the real thing." Then right before the 
idea of Coca-Cola pops into your mind, they start talking about cool 
refreshing milk.

Another one that stands out vividly is the song about trying to get people 
to "cook with gas." The sample of that song is real long, and every aspect 
of it seems that is could easily be talking about "cooking" with another 
type of gas. Namely one often found in a dentist's office.

Really, really impressive stuff in my opinion. Those two collaborating is 
nothing short of musical genius as a minimum. Even more so, I really think 
they are taking things to a whole other level by tapping into learned 
responses that we as consumers have developed, and actually manipulating 
them.

I would pay $25 to see Z-Trip and Radar any night of the week. I remember 
DLRich and DLKelly brought them for NYE 2000 out at the Penguins practice 
arena. Awesome, awesome.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Goldie bashing

I agree with George.  The public has become much more cautious when it comes 
to things of this nature.  The flyer, the unknown company and a few other 
things did make this event look suspicious.  It is always better to find out 
the facts before automatically assuming the worst and starting rumors 
though.  It would be a shame for someone who is actually trying do do 
something good for our scene (if that's the case) to be hurt by a few 
peoples ignorant rumors.  I truly hope this turns out well, our scene has 
been held back for too long by people with the wrong intentions.

And to StellarHybrid15 AKA Nikelz comment about candy kids I think you need 
to keep your mouth shut.  As I remember a few months ago you were saying how 
Bad Boy Bill and Keoki were gods.. Your intelligence level and your taste of 
good music is about the same...they both rate poorly

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

GlassCity Records Presents:
*Arrival*
Monday, December 23rd 2002
Toledo, Ohio
Robert Armani - Chicago - Techno - High Octane

When you put the words "Chicago" and "Techno" together one man comes to
mind, Robert Armani! The south side "Crown Royal Funksta" has been a
techno staple for the last decade and his discography puts him in a league
all his own. On his first trip to spin in Italy he realized his true
calling while studying to be a Chicago Police officer (we almost lost
him). Just the mention of "Blow It Out", "Burn Out", "Big Dick", "Playing
With a Rubber Band", "Ambulance", and, of course, "Circus Bells", brings
back memories of dancing to them over the past ten years at rave parties
and in clubs all around the world. Dance Mania, ACV, Dust Traxx,
Djax-Up-Beats, and High Octane are the labels where his music has been
released and his remixes of JB3 (Joey Beltram), Paul Johnson, Dave Clarke,
Blake Baxter, Armando, and even Gary Numan have elevated him to the
highest of heights. With sixteen full length album releases and over sixty
single releases it has been hard to avoid Mr. Armani's work while flippin'
through any techno bin. His relentless tour schedule has him on the road
non-stop and his hard hitting, dirty, Chicago Techno has rocked clubs
since his early days of spinning. This is a man of Techno royalty and we
are happy to live under his reign.

Translucent - Chicago - House/Techno - Transparent, DTX 

Translucent, also known as Jason Torres, has been playing and studying
music for over sixteen years. Having been influenced by jazz artists such
as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Charlie Parker, Jason started playing
the trumpet and piano at a young age. His dedication to music earned him a
full jazz scholarship to the prestigious Roosevelt University in Chicago
where, in 1994, he was influenced by another style of music known as House
Music. Jason then began DJing and started something new and fresh in the
dance community: playing live trumpet while spinning records, combining
the elements of live jazz with electronic music. Noticing that Jason had
something special, Paul Johnson, the creator of the gold record "Get, Get
Down," helped Jason create connections in Chicago. Since then, Translucent
has played live trumpet with such greats as Derrick Carter, Timo Maas,
Mark Farina, Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr., Glenn Underground,
Cajmere, Boo Williams, Carlos, and Halo. Recent recording projects include
Glenn Underground's new album on Guidance, work with Derrick Carter on
classic, and Gene Farris on Fluential.

electronic music (r)evolution
(click the * to learn more about a specific performer)

 
ESP Woody McBride Live!
Minneapolis : Communique USA, Bush, Drop Bass Network *
That's right, live! Back in the day Woody and his mighty 303's could be 
spotted here and there, but then the gear went into the studio and never 
came back out...until now. Kicking off his "I'm Psychic You Know..." World 
Tour with his first live performance in our part of the Midwest since Even 
Furthur '96. An hour and a half of wowie-zowie, tripped-out, 
heart-pounding original techno and acid in the tradition of submission to 
the great cosmic energy. Make sure to check out www.djesp.com for info 
about his new on some of the most exciting labels in techno.
Starscream aka #0 from
Des Moines : www.SoundProofCoalition.com, DVS, Matix, Vestax *
Lord almighty! The dj from the most extreme band in heavy metal is coming 
to rock you like a hurricane with insane turntablist skills. His sights 
are locked in on Milwaukee, ready to drop the drum-n-bass and raga like 
you've never heard it before.
Punisher
Detroit : Seismic, Reload, Matrix *
Back by popular demand! Last spring she came out and worked over everyone 
at underground, inc. with an unbelievable set of bangin' beats. This time 
the pint-sized pocket of precise mixing has some new tricks in store for 
another techno lashing.
House Preservation Society
Mystic Bill and Davey Dave
Chicago *
This veteran pair of Windy City all stars has been banging the box 
non-stop since the early days of warehouse and loft parties. United once 
again for a then and now taste of Chicago house music. You not only want 
it, you need it!
Baseck
Los Angeles/Milwaukee : Darkmatter, tigerbeat6, Massive Record Source
When Doormouse left the Midwest for sunnier skies, the Midwest Hardcorps 
faithful were left wondering were they would get their fix. The answer was 
Baseck! Blistering broken beats and anything else that is hard to the 
core; you know the score.
Feather
San Diego : Native:State, uvart.org *
Part psychedelic shaman, part performer, and part artist acting as a 
trance channel bringing forth light, oneness, and unity through the sounds 
of funky goa. Riding the flow, he has reached the masses from the SoCal 
deserts to the Burning Man festival.
Joe Vor-Tech
Brooklyn : Brooklyn Underground, Synthetic Men
Straight from the electroclash ground zero. This sassy underground music 
movement fuses the punk-inspired retro sounds of 80's new wave, synth pop, 
and electro with fashion and art to create a new music future that you 
can't help but enjoy.
TJ Richter
Inner Space : mindplasma.net *
A hyper-kinetic goblin of fun presenting a pulsating plasma of spoken 
word, light, and sound with mega-bass from outer space that flattens 
Discovery World like road kill, SQUOOSH!
Mega/Blast Fhresh
featuring J-Slim, Red Shift, and Baseck
Milwaukee : Addict, Massive Record Source
The artist formerly known as Heep Hup Fresssh. This DJ team uses sick-ass 
turntablism to create cool crunchy hip-hop soundscapes from bass, breaks, 
bleeps, and noise.

Midwest Technoclash
Expect nothing short of an all-out techno royal rumble when you take three 
of the Midwest's favorite dj's and add multiple 1200's with a barrage of 
effects.

Rusty Habitz
Milwaukee : Drop Bass Network, WBA *
versus
Wobbler
Appleton : Drop Bass Network, Garbagegame

Lush
Beloit : Poopiehead, Soulmates *

soulful house.
Diva D
Madison : Poopiehead Productions *
Queen of the decks, combining a passion for spinning with a wicked 
drum-n-bass selection.
Urbane
Madison : Cataclysmic, Well Known Djs *
Integrating hardcore and dark drum-n-bass, the result is guaranteed 
dancefloor devastation.
Michael Wenz
Milwaukee : Artist Underground, Raving Lunatiks
If the sound of acid techno is your thing, submit your soul to the 
archangel Wenzebub.
Angelus
Riverwest : Drop-A-Log, Wheeled
A fixture in Milwaukee clubbing, he's been known to bump the house time 
and time again.

Sat Jan 25                      BUBBLE BOBBLE                    Central OH

Monster Productions presents...
Bubble Bobble <><>The Bubble Party<><>
Sat Jan 25th 2003
Central, OH
Admission: $15
>From the people who brought you B2S, the 12 hour, $4 parti in downtown... 
Justice, bringing warehouse parties back to Columbus... Back 2 Skool 2, 
keeping the columbus parti scene alive for only $6.... Bubble Bobble. This 
is an fundraiser for a HUGE event in the summer of 2003. This will have 
bubble machines running all night long!
TALENT:
Kevin Reynolds: Live Pa/Techno - Detroit, MI
Kevin is one of the best Techno artist that has ever came across the 
Mid-West and Detroit. His Funky and exhilerating style produced live will 
keep you dancing.
Thomas James: Residual Recordings - Deep House/Min. Techno - Columbus, OH
Thomas James is co-owner, with Titonton Duvante, of Residual Recordings. 
Founded in 1998, Residual is recognized worldwide for it's consistent deep 
house, and melodic techno grooves. The impressive Residual discography
boasts releases by accomplished artists such as Boo Williams, John Tejada, 
Dan Curtin, Fabrice Lig, Todd Sines and Titonton. As a DJ, Thomas James is 
known for his impecable taste in deep house, melodic and minimal techno. 
His track selection inspires and his skill motivates. Thomas has held 
residencies at Axis (Columbus), Club 504 (Columbus), Touch (Cleveland) and 
is currently half the force behind columbus' first all live electronic 
monthly event, Proceed. As host of these evenings, international caliber 
guests have included Kit Clayton, Glenn Underground, DJ Swamp, Dan Bell, 
John Tejada, Robert Hood and Hannah to name a few. Future plans include 
new 
releases on Residual, and another return to Europe where he's played in 
Switzerland and Spain.
JJ BOOGIE: www.wellknowndjs.com / www.groovereactor.com Groovereactor - 
Trance & House - Cincinnati, OH
A veteran behind the decks now in his 7th year, JJ BOOGIE
is one of the names to watch in 2003. Having been booked all over the US 
and in Canada - look for a fresh set of the top dance tracks you will ever 
hear. His peak time sets create an amazing energy and you can expect the 
whole room to be dancing non-stop. He's now touring to support the release 
of his recent mixed CD - GENESIS and his upcoming vinyl album on his own 
Groove Reactor Records.
Quantum: Mythodic/CEG/Ritual - House/Progressive - Columbus, OH
To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.
Nostalgic: Downtown Entertainment - Funky Breaks - Dayton, OH
Aus-10: Ascension DJ's - Intelligent DNB - Columbus, OH
NautiKat: Ascension DJ's - Female UK Hard House/Trance - Columbus, OH
Oompaloompa: Airplane Clique - Trance - Norwood, OH
Glennard Skynard: so real ent. - HHC - Columbus, OH

Sat Feb 22                        ONE LOVE                           Lorain

Saturday 2-22-03~One Love~NE Ohio~Dj Rap, Charles Feelgood, Jackal, and
more~

Wishing Well and Groovefuel make a venture north to Lorain Ohio for......
One Love.......


featuring some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky,
Tennessee, New York, Florida, and many other states representing. This is
an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio and see how much of a
great scene we are and what we can produce if we cooperate. We have
selected many dj's and have gotten full support from all surrounding crews
to bring you the following crowd rockers with more to be announced in the
next few days.


_Dj_Rap_(Proper Talent)_United_Kingdom
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londons Charissa Saverio, aka DJ
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female,
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent,
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles_Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene".

To this day, Feelgood remains one of the most beloved DJs in the country.
>From Coast to Coast and from week to week he can be seen spinning at
landmark clubs such as Twilo, Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild
popularity overseas. With Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak
hour House sets only one question remains - Can You Feel It?

ON THE CUT AND DROP TOUR WE HAVE JACKAL AND FACTORe
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_Set_(Hallucination Recordings, Groovefuel 
LLC)_Miami, Florida
"Scott Weiser (Jackal) needs no introduction, both of his groups Jackal &
Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables
from Los Angeles to Berlin."-URB MAGAZINE He has performed live all over
America for over a decade and has toured Germany extensively playing all
eight major cities there. His major accomplishments as a producer have led
him to remix work for the likes of 'Limp Bizkit' 'No Doubt' 'Kid Rock'
'Yello' and 'Love & Rockets' to name a few. He now brings you the 'Jackal
Digital Mix Set' an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids.

Factor E

Odi

Voigt-Kampff

JJ Boogie

Annalyze

Nautigroove

Ariel w/ Kwest On

Walkingstick

_Mark_Mayhem_(Grand Poo-bas, Ascension_am)Columbus
Mark Mayhem has had a rapid impact on the midwest
music scene,rockin dance floors from Columbus to
Chicago with his smooth, funky blends of house, techno and trance. This 
guy is not to be missed.

_Doug_Burkhart_(Grand Poo-bas, Ascension_am)Cleveland
Owner of Grand Poo-bas Record Shoppe and Saturday night resident at The Spy
Bar, Doug is no stranger to the Cleveland scene. He has held down weekly
residencies for the past 12 years, and the vibe he can create makes for a
true house music experience you can feel and will remember.

Digital Psykosis

Kitsonik

Ale Fillman

G13

Cyberspeed

Vinny Bricks vs Cluster Poindexter

_Clay-Born_(Wishing Well, Breakline Crew)Louisville, KY
He might play alot of Wishing Well/Groovefuel events but he never fails
to rock it and is our little buddy who we rescued from the sounds of hard
house a couple of years ago. That's right if you were at Shamrock in
Columbus you saw him rip some Uk Hard House, but that is all in the past.

Melk-E

Pristine

_Tease_(In-The-Groove, Groovefuel)_Cincinnati
Making his first Cleveland appearance this young trance prodigy has a
bunch in store and he sets the vibe. He will be bringing mad cds so make
sure you are front and center for his set.

Adam Wright

_Anita_DeCastro_(Scarab Records)_Indianapolis
This young funky breaks master is making her way into what is soon to be a
great breaks scene here in the Midwest. At the young age of 18, the future
is looking very bright and from here the sky is the limit.

N:Coder

_DJ_Xander_(www.djxander.com)_Pittsburgh
For three years Dj Xander has had his heart set in the world of
electronic music. Whether it's producing, throwing parties, djing, or
tagging with his partner, 2rip, Xander keeps his head in what he's doing
to create the ultimate vibe to keep his crowd begging for more. This
aspiring, young talent has landed himself on the same lineups as talents
like Dj Icey, Frankie Bones, and Huda-Hudia. Prepare for yet another
unforgettable journey as you are about to be moved by the sounds of Dj
Xander.


and more.

Subject: {pb-cle} looking for dj, musicians

Hi all. I have been looking for a dj-turntablist and/or musicians who might be intersted in jamming. I play keyboards in various electronic styles, and i think it would be great to get a project going with a dj and funky bass player. To me, genre isn't as important as feeling. This could be just for fun, but who knows where it could go? Drop me an email if you are interested.

what that means is that if someone is trying to find out whats goin on, =
it
is very likely that they are gonna find these sites first.  Having your
website, logo, dj, company, event, promotion, or whatever listed with us =
is
a sure way to make sure that people in your target audience know what is
goin down and when to be there.  While implementing these projects I =
have
met ALOT of promoters who are very excited about what I am are doing and
they are always more than happy to help me as I am helping them.  Its =
called
working together.  Can you do it?

here are some stats straight off my usage charts that some of you people =

and
more functional.  It also has a working Calendar system, uploads, and

from the old system and you will have to re-register, but I think in the

     Following suit with Tennessee and Indiana we have added a Private =

Those stats do NOT say that people think it is a good resource.  Those 
people are probably there trying to get off the fucking list!

Silverraver.com gets around 900 hits a day and I don't promote it like an 
ass-hole.   I don't promote it at all actually.

fuck spammers

blah blah blah blah. 

Maybe you should consider becoming an active member of this list and

Chill out on the guy you porgs!  The Scene Ohio site is pretty good and does allot to support the community.  Probably more than most of you are doing.  At least he isnt promoteing lolli or porn or something.  Stop wasteing your time putting down other peoples efforts and do something yourself.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} :SCENE: Ohio - List Notice

well, the 4 people that e21 said were bitching are people that are still
doing things in the scene... they are doing something themselves.  Whether
it is a good site or not is a mute point, the point of the matter is that
subbing someone to a list without them opting into it is ILLEGAL, and if i
ever get signed up to that garbage without my approval I will take legal
action.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} :SCENE: Ohio - List Notice

I believe you meant a moot point.  But regardless....he's right.  Signing
someone up for something without their permission is totally illegal.  And
gives me the right to shove a radish up the ass of anyone who does it. 
mmmmm.

Yes, and Blatant Self-Promotion is explicitly forbidden by the list
moderator. For shame!

Spammer.

Isn't that how all email lists are? It's petty and annoying and we
all must love it because we all do it (!)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} :SCENE: Ohio - List Notice

no i meant a mute point.  a moot point is something that is debatable or
requires debate. a mute point is one that i lay no relevance upon cause it
doesnt matter.  I just phrased it poorly, i should have stated that my
reaction to the point was mute, because it clearly had no relevance for
discussion because they were wrong.  I'm taking liberty with my english and
liking it.

moot : Subject to debate; arguable: a moot question.
mute : Expressed without speech; unspoken: a mute appeal.

either way, it's SPAM, it's unsolicited, and it's weak promotion.

  Wow.  I hope your not serious.  If so you really are stupid.  Do you take
legal action against every unsolicted mail you get.  If so you must be in
debt with lawyer fees.

Whether

that
    subbing someone to a list without them opting into it is ILLEGAL, and if
i

file your complaints about spam to the host right here:
steven@sceneserver.net

anyone who needs to have their precious email removed may send their
addresses with the complaint.

btw guys, this list is from May, I havent sent an email on it since August,
and I have not added any names.  The only reason i even sent it out was to
let everyone know we got a new board so we can get our registered members
back up to where it was.  90% of my list is members that have subscriped
with confirmaton #s from going to the website in the first place.  Theres a
few hundred straglers that were pulled from the net, or submitted by
promoters when we started.  FYI, if your email is on the intenet anywere,
someone is gonna find it and use it, so dont be surprised when you get some
emails you didnt ask for.

Each and everyone of you who are bitchin, have gotten emails before and have
had the oppurtunity to remove yourself at that time.  If you have not done
so I apologize.  Yall could have easily emailed me to get removed or done so
automatically.

You know its pretty sick that within our industry there are so many haters
trying to stomp on other people in the industry, use your time and energy to
get pissed off at some real spam - that chinese bastard emailing you about
buying some v-18 deisel engine), rather than a person much like yourselves
doin his own thing just like you...

Its called working together, can you do it Goose?  can you trout?  what
about you pangea?  nick?  what about you Mr Pope

yall are so thickhead and obnoxious you wouldnt even take the time to get to
know me and what i do....  travel down to TN or ask around...go out to cali
and ask around... i been hooking people up all over the midwest and around
the world with anything and everything i can do, for what reason?  Just to
do it..  I work my ass off to support the local industry in Ohio, Indiana,
Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri.  And those
are just the places I can drive too.  I have more websites and customer
stretching around the globe.  Over 50% of the websites I run are hosted
free, designed free, and hooked up becuase i am a firm believer in helping
people so that maybe someday someone would help me.

call it whatever you want.. but i call it love and respect for the industry

game on - flame that now please

I'm a Mr?  Since when?  Last time I looked (which was about 10 minutes ago
when I went to the bathroom), I was a female.  Anyways, for someone who
does stuff simply because you want to help people, you sure seem to expect
a lot of praise/recognition/appreciation for it.  Hrmmmm.  I've decided
you're a tool.  :o)  Eat me.

Thanks Trout for posting! Fading slideshow the shiznizzle. :-)http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/archives/pictures/abbasso
It was good to see some Pb-Cle'ers there!  :-)

Also, is anyone heading out to Joy in NYC tonight? That should be an awesome time, and for a good cause. If you're going to be in the City tomorrow night also, hit me up with a pm. Reduced list for DAVID MORALES !


Happy holidays everyone...

yeah, i'll put up any party/club pix, just send a zip file, helps if you 
name the pix something descriptive because that becomes the caption by 
default   :)

i've gotta get around to leeching a few other picture sites out there.
maybe next year.

Goose, care to enlighten me either publicly or privately as to what the
utc@ftc.gov account is about, or maybe how it works?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} :SCENE: Ohio - List Notice

the federal trade commission shuts down mass spammers by tracing each one, i
figure they're backlogged as hell, but it's better than doing nothing about
it... you can read more on www.ftc.gov page where they also have a fill out
form if you want to go that route if you have more information than what is
on the email (like in this case, we know the host, the promoter, etc) so if
someone who received the spam wanted to, they could forward that message on
to the ftc.  since it's hard to sort spam from good mail for a mail server,
our sysadmin just recommended that we set up junk mail senders and forward
each new spam message to that address.

1) The thing you continually fail to realize is that it's not WHAT you're
attempting to do, it's HOW you're doing it.

While it may be admirable that you're trying to promote unity and
communication in the dance scene, doing it by undesirable methods gets you
nowhere and may actually impede your progress instead of furthering your
cause.

You're like those whackjobs who think it's OK to murder doctors who perform
abortions.

Your defense for spamming people is essentially "You already get spam, so
here's some more that is actually worthwhile." But that philosopy isn't
right. SPAM IS SPAM, and just because YOU'RE the one sending it doesn't make
it any more special than the offers to lengthen my penis.


2) You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

Sure, you spammed. It's over and done with.

But the fact that you were a DICK about it to Nick S. afterwards not only
makes you a Spammer, but effectively ruins any credibility you MIGHT have
gained by explaining yourself like a normal adult. Instead, you acted like a
child, calling him out and trying to embarrass someone for something YOU did
wrong.

You're a walking waste of breath. Get off the list.

file your complaints about spam to the host right here:
steven@sceneserver.net

anyone who needs to have their precious email removed may send their
addresses with the complaint.

btw guys, this list is from May, I havent sent an email on it since August,
and I have not added any names.  The only reason i even sent it out was to
let everyone know we got a new board so we can get our registered members
back up to where it was.  90% of my list is members that have subscriped
with confirmaton #s from going to the website in the first place.  Theres a
few hundred straglers that were pulled from the net, or submitted by
promoters when we started.  FYI, if your email is on the intenet anywere,
someone is gonna find it and use it, so dont be surprised when you get some
emails you didnt ask for.

Each and everyone of you who are bitchin, have gotten emails before and have
had the oppurtunity to remove yourself at that time.  If you have not done
so I apologize.  Yall could have easily emailed me to get removed or done so
automatically.

You know its pretty sick that within our industry there are so many haters
trying to stomp on other people in the industry, use your time and energy to
get pissed off at some real spam - that chinese bastard emailing you about
buying some v-18 deisel engine), rather than a person much like yourselves
doin his own thing just like you...

Its called working together, can you do it Goose?  can you trout?  what
about you pangea?  nick?  what about you Mr Pope

yall are so thickhead and obnoxious you wouldnt even take the time to get to
know me and what i do....  travel down to TN or ask around...go out to cali
and ask around... i been hooking people up all over the midwest and around
the world with anything and everything i can do, for what reason?  Just to
do it..  I work my ass off to support the local industry in Ohio, Indiana,
Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri.  And those
are just the places I can drive too.  I have more websites and customer
stretching around the globe.  Over 50% of the websites I run are hosted
free, designed free, and hooked up becuase i am a firm believer in helping
people so that maybe someday someone would help me.

call it whatever you want.. but i call it love and respect for the industry

game on - flame that now please

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} :SCENE: Ohio - List Notice

You're exactly right Mark. I gave a knee-jerk response to another guy 
because the same thing happened. I was able to unsubscribe after responding, 
and this other guy sent me what I am pasting below. I give him a lot of 
credit, and even went so far as to sort of apologize cause I assumed he 
would be a choad about it.

We apologize for the inconvenience.  However, when doing a search for your 
e-mail address,
nothing comes up.  Is there maybe another address that is forwarding your 
e-mails to this one?
...or did you already unsubscribe yourself?  Please advise, so that we may 
remove you.


Thanks.
Another Level

1) The thing you continually fail to realize is that it's not WHAT you're
attempting to do, it's HOW you're doing it.

While it may be admirable that you're trying to promote unity and
communication in the dance scene, doing it by undesirable methods gets you
nowhere and may actually impede your progress instead of furthering your
cause.

You're like those whackjobs who think it's OK to murder doctors who perform
abortions.

Your defense for spamming people is essentially "You already get spam, so
here's some more that is actually worthwhile." But that philosopy isn't
right. SPAM IS SPAM, and just because YOU'RE the one sending it doesn't make
it any more special than the offers to lengthen my penis.


2) You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

Sure, you spammed. It's over and done with.

But the fact that you were a DICK about it to Nick S. afterwards not only
makes you a Spammer, but effectively ruins any credibility you MIGHT have
gained by explaining yourself like a normal adult. Instead, you acted like a
child, calling him out and trying to embarrass someone for something YOU did
wrong.

You're a walking waste of breath. Get off the list.

file your complaints about spam to the host right here:
steven@sceneserver.net

anyone who needs to have their precious email removed may send their
addresses with the complaint.

btw guys, this list is from May, I havent sent an email on it since August,
and I have not added any names.  The only reason i even sent it out was to
let everyone know we got a new board so we can get our registered members
back up to where it was.  90% of my list is members that have subscriped
with confirmaton #s from going to the website in the first place.  Theres a
few hundred straglers that were pulled from the net, or submitted by
promoters when we started.  FYI, if your email is on the intenet anywere,
someone is gonna find it and use it, so dont be surprised when you get some
emails you didnt ask for.

Each and everyone of you who are bitchin, have gotten emails before and have
had the oppurtunity to remove yourself at that time.  If you have not done
so I apologize.  Yall could have easily emailed me to get removed or done so
automatically.

You know its pretty sick that within our industry there are so many haters
trying to stomp on other people in the industry, use your time and energy to
get pissed off at some real spam - that chinese bastard emailing you about
buying some v-18 deisel engine), rather than a person much like yourselves
doin his own thing just like you...

Its called working together, can you do it Goose?  can you trout?  what
about you pangea?  nick?  what about you Mr Pope

yall are so thickhead and obnoxious you wouldnt even take the time to get to
know me and what i do....  travel down to TN or ask around...go out to cali
and ask around... i been hooking people up all over the midwest and around
the world with anything and everything i can do, for what reason?  Just to
do it..  I work my ass off to support the local industry in Ohio, Indiana,
Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri.  And those
are just the places I can drive too.  I have more websites and customer
stretching around the globe.  Over 50% of the websites I run are hosted
free, designed free, and hooked up becuase i am a firm believer in helping
people so that maybe someday someone would help me.

call it whatever you want.. but i call it love and respect for the industry

game on - flame that now please

Friends don't let friends spam.

Besides, it's a good way to get yourself banned from sending email to a good portion of the world.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} :SCENE: Ohio - List Notice

I hope all you have figured out how to email me for removal or have auto
removed your email addresses.  :SCENE: Ohio will be using the mass mailing
system to send out weekly event announcements via html rich email for all
the promoters that work with us to promote events.
So if one message is bustin your balls, more are come and on a regular
basis.  I have no way to know whos who on that list, its effin huge.
However, I always immediately remove anyone who requests it, if they have
not already removed themselves.  I was under the impression that all the
people that did not want to be on this list had removed themselves months
ago.  Also, I was informed by several knowledgeable host reps that if an
email message has a way to remove, then that is not considered spam.

I guess this is forewarning so i wont get you guys all worked up again.

If you would like to make complaints, you can make them to my host, but that
is me.  My host email address is abuse@sceneserver.net   If you were really
upset and I made you really mad you could email my bandwidth provider at
abuse@tiora.net  You can also send my stuff to the FTC if you would really
like to.

Hey Everyone...

I have the technology ready to deliver the high quality sets of some well 
known artists.   The way it works is like this, at the end of each month I'm 
going to post a set or two of some well known people.   Whoever gets to it 
first gets to download it.   There will be a limit of like 10-15 people that 
will be allowed to download.   After that, the download turns off...   First 
come first serve.   This will happen near the end of each month.   it will be 
posted here on the list when a new one comes online.

Great music should be available out there.   There are a huge number of great 
sets on my HD and should be shared in some way.

Lastly, if you have some really good sets that you would like to share with 
me (and with the list/or world) let me know and we can set something up.

Anyway.   I hope everyone is heading into a great holiday.

Beginning last year in downtown Buffalo, over the last
365 days I'm sure we can all say our lives have
changed in one way or another - It was a Fresh Start
to a year that was an Eye Opener. About half way
through the year we went into Maximum Boost to help us
through the summer months, had a Booty Call that
didn't quite turned out as planned, but hey some booty
is better than none!  We then planned a 'Solution' for
every Wednesday of the week to be a fun night out, and
it's now become the start of the weekend! There still
seemed to be something missing, we needed some fun
that had no boundries, no limits, so we had a Super
Ultra MegaHappyFunRave!!! Everyone still seemed
hungry, so we filled your souls with a feast of a
party the night before Thanksgiving!! Which is now
leading us into 2003... What will the future hold for
us? Only one way to find out, party on new years and
figure out the rest later!!!!!! 

We listened to the requests from everyone, put our
thinking caps on, assembled a solid lineup of
headliners and locals that have been Moving on Up in
the world, I think we accomplished the task of
providing something for everyone... All of the DJs are
overly excited to be spending New Years with us, every
set will be something to remember!

Chris Anderson
-Chemistry Records/Catalyst/Caffeine/Fused - Houston
** You've probably heard his track "50,000 Watts"
which always fills dancefloors, that and his latest
track "Rolling Bass" were just licensed to the new
Carl Cox Area 2 Tour CD on Moonshine. He's known as
the "godfather of the Houston Underground." He runs a
record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label
(Crackhouse), produces tracks, and DJs all over the
world. If you like Josh The Funky 1 you'll love this
guy! This will be his first visit to Buffalo, let's
show him how we like to party!

Rob Solo
Ottawa,Canada
Everyone needs some booty on New Years! Final
performance ever in the area as he moves oversea's.
It's been a while since he's played here, a perfect
night to wish him well on his future!

Ryan Ruckus
(Toronto, Canada)
Hustlin Beats Recordings, Empire Productions
Yea he's been here a bunch of times, but ya know
what.. when he heard that there was going to be a New
Years party in Buffalo he wanted to spend it with all
of us in one of his favorite cities to perform in.
Plus, the man always brings a bag full of tunes that
wreck the dancefloor!!! He'll be pulling double duty
on this night like a rockstar! 

Jarefox & Sunrize
Rochester vs Pittsburgh, on the quest to provide a
little something for everyone we booked two of the
Northeasts fastest rising stars in the world of happy
hardcore!!

Skoobie
Morning Trance set - He's back from Cleveland, if
anyone remembers his closing set at Phlux's Eternity 3
then you know that when the lights come on we'll want
an encore!!!

Crash
St. Catherines
DNB - He's performed numerous times at the Return,
continually throws amazing events in Southern Ontario,


Bullets
Techno - The man behind Silk Fridays at 658 will be
the first DJ to ring in the New Year!!

Paaj
Tech-House - This cooky character is one of the most
dedicated DJs, he's going to be doing the countdown
set to 2003!!

Hoogs
DNB - Consistent. Nothing else needs to be said!

Sigma & Jonah The Ghost
UK Hard House battle - Ever since last New Years Sigma
has been tearing apart sound systems everywhere he's
played, bringing Jonah the Ghost into the equation
will make this set something to tell the grandkids
about!

2 Phat Pollox
Morning breaks set - General consensus seemed to be
that some dark breaks are perfect for the closing
hours, DJP and Tongue Chew are going to somehow make
it through the night to close w/ style!!!

Dirwood
House - One of the men behind Drop the Beat Thursdays
at the Elwmood Lounge, he's moved up in the area to be
one of the leaders of bringing quality music to the
masses!!

Perceptor
DNB - Tune in every Tuesday night to WBNY 91.3 for his
radio show, another local who over the previous year
has been Moving on Up even further to lead us into the
future of DNB!!!

Thik
Techno - Another extremely dedicated local who has
been helping The Groove move on up in the area as the
best Niteclub featuring the best in electronic music,
it's been a while since he's played a party so be
prepared to be blown away at what you hear - I
guarantee you'll be impressed!!!

Melvin P
Late night hardcore set - Not for the weak, make sure
to take your heart medication!!!

And two newcomers to start the night off...

Pak Man
Trance - You may not have heard the name before, but
this is one local that will be movin on up in 2003 to
be a household name. Trance will always be here, he's
going to help guarantee that!!

Dink Winkerson


The club will have an ALL NIGHT LIQUOR LICENSE!

Wow...you all need to chill on the whole spam thing.  Have any of your 
checked out his sight?  He's providing a cost free service to you, to help 
promote the scene in ohio (as well and tennesee and indiana).

I could see if it were some Viagra add or porno b.s. but this guy is trying 
to promote the scene in a state that he doesn't even live in.  Thats good 
shit....

Ohio needs a decent bbs, and this one could be it.

Peace,
J

how about asking if we'd like to subscribe, cause i know i sure as hell didnt.
The first time this went around, everyone that was subscribed to the pb-cle list
got added onto the spam...  even then i asked nicely to be taken off. 

Try some other option there buddy, cause it's semi starting to piss me off.

Thanks :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Goldie bashing

WTF?  Am I missing something here?

Matt B is a stand up guy, who in the short time I have known him has made a
lasting impression on me.  He is one of the people in northeast ohio who are
working their ass off to make this a better place to live.  If you have
personal issues, or a disagreement regarding your taste in music then I
suggest you drop it or keep it off the list.  You _should_ go out to a CTN
event, so that you can see for yourself that I am right.

Regarding BBB, he gets more criticism than he deserves but that is the
position he put himself in. For a period of time he brought a misconception
of the term house music but the maturity in his track selection the last few
years really shows that he capable of progression and is in it for the long
haul.  Progression is one of the key factors that determines a good dj.

Keoki, on the other hand, is difficult to discuss.  Did he make it because
of talent or just because of his high-profile lifestyle.  I heard him spin a
sober set and he was truely brilliant, though I have seen him countles other
times when he was a joke.  I guess he is one of those people you have to say
"he is what he is".

Speaking my mind,
Doug Burkhart

Fuck you too asshole.

I dont like Matt, and I dont have to.

How successful his shit is, is irrelevant to that fucko.

Last time I checked, just cuz someone does good or other ppl like him, it doesnt mean I have to.

I dont WANT to run anything anyway.  It aint me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} G.o.m.d.

i didnt say anything about you two, all i was cracking on was how much drama
she made.  as for matt b, all i know is that the guy has shown nothing but
devotion to what he does.  everything he is a part of is very much supported
in numbers, and he is very passionate about providing a vibe so that others
can have a good time.  it's one thing to support a scene by going to events,
its another ballgame when you are the one supplying the events week in and
week out.  i'm not saying you cant have personal beef with a guy, that's
your own prerogative, but who's ass is he kissing?  maybe you are confusing
appreciation with ass kissing?  it's cool for a promoter to appreciate his
dj's.  it's cool for a promoter to appreciate that a venue allows them to
host events.  it's cool for a promoter to appreciate local record shops for
allowing them to drop flyers and also for providing the vinyl for the
performers.  it's cool for a promoter to appreciate his patrons.

save the hate for the asian jesus, he's the only person i can think of on
this list that deserves catching shit from people.

Then why put your judgement in?..

It really ticks me off to see BS like this coming across the pb-cle
especially when you Nikkelz, hasnt even came out to Kent for any night that
we've had there.
Im not saying you have to come, but dont judge others if you havent been in
their presence.

stay gay..

Subject: {pb-cle} First HQ Mp3 - Basement Jaxx

The first Mix is from Basement Jaxx.  Replayed on BBC Radio 1 in the UK due to the overwhelming vote of the listeners that it was the best Essential Mix of 1999.  Essential Mix is Hosted by Pete Tong and this really does have to be right up the house/2 step camp.  This 2 hour set is worth the 109 meg download.

Get it while you can!  Go here:
http://www.djbradanderson.com/
   Go to the Mixes section.  There will only be ten  (10) download slots.  After that, no more downloads.  hit it fast while it's available.

Subject: {pb-cle} techno mix


I decided to make a mix of deep techno from my techno collection as an
experiment.  I originally wasn't going to give it out en masse (and I
still won't, CD wise) but I listened to it a few times and I feel it is
decent enough to share.  It isn't on my web page (and might never be) but
here are the direct links:

real audio:
http://box.412dnb.com/~ratana/mixes/ratana-transitions1_techno-dec2002.ram

mp3:
http://box.412dnb.com/~ratana/mixes/ratana-transitions1_techno-dec2002.mp3


This represents my first effort to make a techno mix, so needless to say,
it is far from perfect, but I still think people would be able to enjoy
it.  If you haven't heard the technoir release (audio is on
www.technoiraudio.com) two of the cuts are in here.  I'd appreciate any
feedback, especially from the techno afficionados.  I'm still not
subscribed to the list so please email me personally. thanks :)

Also happy holidays to everyone and a happy new year --

Clubs in the UK and in Germany have used it for their projection screens...  It's for mac and peecee.  Badass.  The original project started 10 years ago for Mac OS 7 under After Dark.  last year it was ported to Mac OS X and now it's for Windows.

I for one and sitting in my new house, drinking a lot of Heineken, and twisting a lot of green leafs.  There will be a party, and others joining me.  My friend Wade is spinning in it, too.  Yep, tha same one I've been promoting for over a year now... with him on tha decks, I can bet nowhere in Pittsburgh that doesnt have have Ryan Matthew playing will be better musically.  At least if ya like trance house and breaks.

Merry Christmas all, and a Happy New Year.

Even Tom.

Subject: {pb-cle} Xmas in Cincy

I was not prepared. Just got back from the lil Xmas party here in 
Cincinnati. 2 of the best sets I have heard in a long time. Incredible 
mixing and tracks by 7-up, and phenominal scratching and relentless drum 
beats by Rukus. I wish I could have had some more energy to reallly dance 
along to their sets with justice. Time to sleep....

-Bliss

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

ESP Woody McBride Live!
Minneapolis : Communique USA, Bush, Drop Bass Network *
That's right, live! Back in the day Woody and his mighty 303's could be 
spotted here and there, but then the gear went into the studio and never 
came back out...until now. Kicking off his "I'm Psychic You Know..." World 
Tour with his first live performance in our part of the Midwest since Even 
Furthur '96. An hour and a half of wowie-zowie, tripped-out, 
heart-pounding original techno and acid in the tradition of submission to 
the great cosmic energy. Make sure to check out www.djesp.com for info 
about his new on some of the most exciting labels in techno.
Starscream aka #0 from
Des Moines : www.SoundProofCoalition.com, DVS, Matix, Vestax *
Lord almighty! The dj from the most extreme band in heavy metal is coming 
to rock you like a hurricane with insane turntablist skills. His sights 
are locked in on Milwaukee, ready to drop the drum-n-bass and raga like 
you've never heard it before.
Punisher
Detroit : Seismic, Reload, Matrix *
Back by popular demand! Last spring she came out and worked over everyone 
at underground, inc. with an unbelievable set of bangin' beats. This time 
the pint-sized pocket of precise mixing has some new tricks in store for 
another techno lashing.
House Preservation Society
Mystic Bill and Davey Dave
Chicago *
This veteran pair of Windy City all stars has been banging the box 
non-stop since the early days of warehouse and loft parties. United once 
again for a then and now taste of Chicago house music. You not only want 
it, you need it!
Baseck
Los Angeles/Milwaukee : Darkmatter, tigerbeat6, Massive Record Source
When Doormouse left the Midwest for sunnier skies, the Midwest Hardcorps 
faithful were left wondering were they would get their fix. The answer was 
Baseck! Blistering broken beats and anything else that is hard to the 
core; you know the score.
Feather
San Diego : Native:State, uvart.org *
Part psychedelic shaman, part performer, and part artist acting as a 
trance channel bringing forth light, oneness, and unity through the sounds 
of funky goa. Riding the flow, he has reached the masses from the SoCal 
deserts to the Burning Man festival.
Joe Vor-Tech
Brooklyn : Brooklyn Underground, Synthetic Men
Straight from the electroclash ground zero. This sassy underground music 
movement fuses the punk-inspired retro sounds of 80's new wave, synth pop, 
and electro with fashion and art to create a new music future that you 
can't help but enjoy.
TJ Richter
Inner Space : mindplasma.net *
A hyper-kinetic goblin of fun presenting a pulsating plasma of spoken 
word, light, and sound with mega-bass from outer space that flattens 
Discovery World like road kill, SQUOOSH!
Mega/Blast Fhresh
featuring J-Slim, Red Shift, and Baseck
Milwaukee : Addict, Massive Record Source
The artist formerly known as Heep Hup Fresssh. This DJ team uses sick-ass 
turntablism to create cool crunchy hip-hop soundscapes from bass, breaks, 
bleeps, and noise.

Midwest Technoclash
Expect nothing short of an all-out techno royal rumble when you take three 
of the Midwest's favorite dj's and add multiple 1200's with a barrage of 
effects.

Rusty Habitz
Milwaukee : Drop Bass Network, WBA *
versus
Wobbler
Appleton : Drop Bass Network, Garbagegame

Lush
Beloit : Poopiehead, Soulmates *
Saturating your spirit and making it soar with the sound of jazz-infected 
soulful house.
Diva D
Madison : Poopiehead Productions *
Queen of the decks, combining a passion for spinning with a wicked 
drum-n-bass selection.
Urbane
Madison : Cataclysmic, Well Known Djs *
Integrating hardcore and dark drum-n-bass, the result is guaranteed 
dancefloor devastation.
Michael Wenz
Milwaukee : Artist Underground, Raving Lunatiks
If the sound of acid techno is your thing, submit your soul to the 
archangel Wenzebub.

and time again.

Sat Jan 25th 2003
Central, OH
Admission: $15
>From the people who brought you B2S, the 12 hour, $4 parti in downtown... 
Justice, bringing warehouse parties back to Columbus... Back 2 Skool 2, 
keeping the columbus parti scene alive for only $6.... Bubble Bobble. This 
is an fundraiser for a HUGE event in the summer of 2003. This will have 
bubble machines running all night long!
TALENT:
Kevin Reynolds: Live Pa/Techno - Detroit, MI
Kevin is one of the best Techno artist that has ever came across the 
Mid-West and Detroit. His Funky and exhilerating style produced live will 
keep you dancing.
Thomas James: Residual Recordings - Deep House/Min. Techno - Columbus, OH
Thomas James is co-owner, with Titonton Duvante, of Residual Recordings. 
Founded in 1998, Residual is recognized worldwide for it's consistent deep 
house, and melodic techno grooves. The impressive Residual discography
boasts releases by accomplished artists such as Boo Williams, John Tejada, 
Dan Curtin, Fabrice Lig, Todd Sines and Titonton. As a DJ, Thomas James is 
known for his impecable taste in deep house, melodic and minimal techno. 
His track selection inspires and his skill motivates. Thomas has held 
residencies at Axis (Columbus), Club 504 (Columbus), Touch (Cleveland) and 
is currently half the force behind columbus' first all live electronic 
monthly event, Proceed. As host of these evenings, international caliber 
guests have included Kit Clayton, Glenn Underground, DJ Swamp, Dan Bell, 
John Tejada, Robert Hood and Hannah to name a few. Future plans include 
new 
releases on Residual, and another return to Europe where he's played in 
Switzerland and Spain.
JJ BOOGIE: www.wellknowndjs.com / www.groovereactor.com Groovereactor - 
Trance & House - Cincinnati, OH
A veteran behind the decks now in his 7th year, JJ BOOGIE
is one of the names to watch in 2003. Having been booked all over the US 
and in Canada - look for a fresh set of the top dance tracks you will ever 
hear. His peak time sets create an amazing energy and you can expect the 
whole room to be dancing non-stop. He's now touring to support the release 
of his recent mixed CD - GENESIS and his upcoming vinyl album on his own 
Groove Reactor Records.
Quantum: Mythodic/CEG/Ritual - House/Progressive - Columbus, OH
To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.
Nostalgic: Downtown Entertainment - Funky Breaks - Dayton, OH
Aus-10: Ascension DJ's - Intelligent DNB - Columbus, OH
NautiKat: Ascension DJ's - Female UK Hard House/Trance - Columbus, OH

Sat Feb 22                        ONE LOVE                           Lorain

Saturday 2-22-03~One Love~NE Ohio~Dj Rap, Charles Feelgood, Jackal, and
more~

Wishing Well and Groovefuel make a venture north to Lorain Ohio for......
One Love.......


featuring some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky,
Tennessee, New York, Florida, and many other states representing. This is
an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio and see how much of a
great scene we are and what we can produce if we cooperate. We have
selected many dj's and have gotten full support from all surrounding crews
to bring you the following crowd rockers with more to be announced in the
next few days.


_Dj_Rap_(Proper Talent)_United_Kingdom
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londons Charissa Saverio, aka DJ
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female,
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent,
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles_Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene".

To this day, Feelgood remains one of the most beloved DJs in the country.
>From Coast to Coast and from week to week he can be seen spinning at
landmark clubs such as Twilo, Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild
popularity overseas. With Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak
hour House sets only one question remains - Can You Feel It?

ON THE CUT AND DROP TOUR WE HAVE JACKAL AND FACTORe
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_Set_(Hallucination Recordings, Groovefuel 
LLC)_Miami, Florida
"Scott Weiser (Jackal) needs no introduction, both of his groups Jackal &
Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables
from Los Angeles to Berlin."-URB MAGAZINE He has performed live all over
America for over a decade and has toured Germany extensively playing all
eight major cities there. His major accomplishments as a producer have led
him to remix work for the likes of 'Limp Bizkit' 'No Doubt' 'Kid Rock'
'Yello' and 'Love & Rockets' to name a few. He now brings you the 'Jackal
Digital Mix Set' an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids.

Factor E

Odi

Voigt-Kampff

JJ Boogie

Annalyze

Nautigroove

Ariel w/ Kwest On

Walkingstick

_Mark_Mayhem_(Grand Poo-bas, Ascension_am)Columbus
Mark Mayhem has had a rapid impact on the midwest
music scene,rockin dance floors from Columbus to
Chicago with his smooth, funky blends of house, techno and trance. This 
guy is not to be missed.

_Doug_Burkhart_(Grand Poo-bas, Ascension_am)Cleveland
Owner of Grand Poo-bas Record Shoppe and Saturday night resident at The Spy
Bar, Doug is no stranger to the Cleveland scene. He has held down weekly
residencies for the past 12 years, and the vibe he can create makes for a
true house music experience you can feel and will remember.

Digital Psykosis

Kitsonik

Ale Fillman

G13

Cyberspeed

Vinny Bricks vs Cluster Poindexter

_Clay-Born_(Wishing Well, Breakline Crew)Louisville, KY
He might play alot of Wishing Well/Groovefuel events but he never fails
to rock it and is our little buddy who we rescued from the sounds of hard
house a couple of years ago. That's right if you were at Shamrock in
Columbus you saw him rip some Uk Hard House, but that is all in the past.

Melk-E

Pristine

_Tease_(In-The-Groove, Groovefuel)_Cincinnati
Making his first Cleveland appearance this young trance prodigy has a

/// The Definitive Breaks Tour///
Feat. Michael Maxim& Christopher Johnson
With Special Guest: Soniq Stylz

Chances are if you are familiar with the Baltimore/DC scene you have =
heard of these two. They have been taking the region by storm with their =
relentless blend of nu-skool, old-skool, progressive and wicked 2-step =
breakbeat. This all-inclusive performance began as a local favorite and =
has evolved into one of the more highly sought after national demands. =
It's a crowd pleaser and a breakers delight that includes free =
promotional CDs for the patrons and a digital photo documentary of the =
event on various web sites. As an added bonus Soniq Stylz will be =
joining the tour to bring you his trademark style of breaks. Soniq is =
currently on the 'Heat It Up' tour with Jesse Saunders and Charles =
Feelgood, and is ready to back up his reputation as the 'Definitive =
Breaks" tour begins in late January. Don't miss this one or you are sure =
to regretful.=20


The Performers:

/// Christopher Johnson ///
www.definitivebreaks.com www.justtwo.com=20

>From his opening chunky UK 2 Step inspired breakbeats, trademark =
main-room stompers, or one of his signature vocal closing sets, Chris =
receives rave reviews regardless of the city or venue played. One of a =
dying breed of dj's that realizes that there is more to being a dj then =
simply mixing great records; you have to please the crowd. Chris is =
constantly interacting with the crowd, be it teasing them with his =
flawless cutting, pulling tricks out of his sleeve, throwing his arms in =
the air, or flashing his classic smile at the dancers on the floor. He =
pulls girls to the dance floor like bees to honey.

As one of the founding fathers of the Central PA dance music scene Chris =
has experienced all aspects of EDM culture. Nurturing the a new genre of =
music in a region typically know for being ultra-conservative, Chris =
along with fellow pioneers built a truly underground following by =
throwing weekly warehouse raves and house parties.=20
Since moving to Baltimore, he successfully made the transition from =
local DJ to an established member of the region's dance music scene =
playing the nations best dance venues as voted by URB Magazine such as =
Redwood Trust, Sonar, and URS's pick for number one mega club Buzz DC at =
Nation. He along with partner Michael Maxim formed Baltimore largest =
weekly event since the mid 90's. They brought the best in international =
DJ talent, reviving a starving scene and giving birth to a new breed of =
promotion.=20
The true essence of Christopher Johnson is one that cannot be described =
with words. It is artful, imaginative and must be seen live for true =
impact. His energy and ability to connect with the crowd make his =
performances more then simply "great sets", they are unforgettable.




/// Michael Maxim ///
www.definitivebreaks.com www.justtwo.com www.michaelmaxim.com=20

Michael Maxim's passion began on the dance floor in the early 90's with =
Baltimores warehouse parties. He was introduced to the sounds of =
Electronic Dance Music, while attending events by the now nationally =
acclaimed "Ultraworld Productions". Michael's ability to understand the =
crowds desire steams back to time spent on the other side of the booth. =
He knows what it's like to be someone who enjoys dancing and interacting =
with the DJ as well as being that DJ who makes the crowd interact with =
him. Having had this experience on the dance floor has given him the =
necessary know how to work the crowd in a way that will amaze even the =
most meticulous breakbreak critic.=20

There is something to be said about a DJ that is so passionate and =
motivating behind the decks as Michael is. The performance that the =
crowd receives includes not only his superb mixing and track selection =
but also what other DJs spend a lifetime trying to achieve. The =
experience is so invigorating that club-goers leave his events saying =
"Not only did he toss me a free CD, but he was so much fun to watch and =
dance with". Michael Maxim shows his passion and devotion to the crowd =
through music, and they show their appreciation thru their movements on =
the dance floor.=20

In the past, Michael has been noted to play some of the most funky house =
sets in the region. His high demand kept him busy, but after =
participating in the "Battle of The Breaks" at Buzz in March 2002, =
Michael decided to stick to his roots and play what he feels moves the =

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} goldie at heaven and earth


I'm deffinately going.  My good friend DJ Pulse is spinning, plus if its who 
i think it is throwing it, its an oldschool kid that i haven't seen in a 
long time.  Hes a cool dude, i deffinately trust he has his heart in it.

I haven't heard where the show is yet, but since you asked about Heaven and 
Earth - its the space that used to be the old Peabodies.  I've seen 
Monstermagnet - clutch - sugar hill gang, lots of indie groups and many more 
there.  Since peabodies has moved over by CSU a few years ago, it changed 
its name, and Heaven and Earth is an RNB dance club from what i've heard.  
If you were around several years ago, maybe 5, you might remember Just Dance 
that was thrown there when it was peabodies.  There was also a party a 
couple years ago that took place in the upstairs that suffered some issues 
and didn't go so well - for no particular reason besides that some people 
don't know how to let people have a good time.  Fuck it, i want to see 
goldie, sounds good to me.

BTW, I'm not sure about the posting that goldie was in Florida on the 27th, 
cause my girl down in florida that does lasers said that hes promoted in 
Miami for on the 28th so what ever said may have been a typo.

I didn't think so, but I've never heard of Phareal.  

Jenn, I'd like to go.  But I'll wait to get my ticket @ the door just in

Hey mates and ladies! I'm happy to let everyone know that the Dj Storm, UK's Queen of the Jungle is going to be kicking the sound system at the bottom line for pressure this sunday. I do the flyers, and try to help booking and promoting and I'm happy to see how well this night is going. It's going godo because of you, the people of our scene and i didn't think cleveland and our pb/col/det, etc.. friends had it in them, but they sure do! DJ Storm will have a special guest, MC Question Mark from Los Angeles, California, UK:US it's the best combo ever ;) We will also be featuring dj's from pittsburgh, toronto and of course our oh most adorable local talent of dj's and mc's, it's cheap, it's good, and it's d n b ;) 

$1 Drafts  $2 Long Island Iced-Teas and the one, the only, Danger Room Cocktail, the most dangerous drink in town! (and, it's only $3) <-spam, teehee

cheers

i think they should put a tax on everything electronic that can play music.
radios, cd players, cassette players, turntables, etc... that way they've
got their bases covered and their pockets lined.

the only problem with that being that you can burn a whole hell of a 
lot else on CD, such as regular data files, than you can on cassette 
tape.  unless of course you are still using a TRS-80 computer.

I say we all boycott everything that comes off major record labels.  Not
that it's hard to say no to the next boy band release.

Yeah, but they make it up in the CD-R sells that people use for:

1) data
2) file storage and back ups
3) original material

I actually used 50 CD-Rs in the past three
weeks producing tracks, testing them out,
and re-recording them, and then re-testing 
them out, etc..

so they'd make it up...

what works for artists and what works for me is to pay a set amount for each
song downloaded from an artist.  say 5 cents per song, the artist would
receive that money and still be making more than what they would selling a
cd single.  I'd pay 50-75 cents for an album.  it's the executives that
arent making out by music being pirated.  the artists make most of their
money on tours, not on album sales.  the artists arent the ones bitching,
it's the labels.  you gotta read the labels.

yeah but how would you enforce this...?

how do you enforce this $.05 download when it's you and me on a P2P system and you're downloading a song from my archives...?

I would agree with money-directly-to-the-artist, too, but you wouldn't be able to enforce it...

I mean, cheap downloads like that and people may be like "hey -- fuck pirating, i'll geta legal copy for $.05..."  but that's unlikely.. they'll still be people piratting...

... but maybe not ...

i just think the tax thing is the best thing since they are already doing it for casettes and (i'm assuming) VHS... it's already in place, we're not bitching about it, simply add it to the CD-Rs... shit.. i get 100 for $20 anyway... bumping it up to $25 is a $5 boom and .05 per CD (same as your $.05 download) and there'd be MORE money since it'd be on ALL Cd-Rs and Cd-Rws sold... 

Or, make it just for Music CDs, so those labelled as data disks should not be charged... or fuck it.. charge it anyway to make up for the supposed revenue losses...
do SOMETHING.. just stop fuckin' around.

that new justin timberlake album is fucking hot, quit sleeping on
it. seriously. 

and while im at it, that would mean boycotting radiohead, tool,
and alot of other great artists who make worthwhile music. i dont
like that idea. i think everyone should just make an effort to
steal and make avaliable as much music as they can on the P2P
systems, and then spend their money on the shit they like the
best. its the best way.

I think artists need to stop thinking they'll become millionaires
by releasing albums and get back to (GASP) PERFORMING
and TOURING....

most people are scared because their shows suck and no one
wants to go to them... I don't see Bruce Springsteen complaining
aboout pirating .. or even Paul McCartney... they wanna get paid?
they just tour... (and had two of the highest grossing tours of=20
2002 by the bye)....

performers wanna make money>

I didn't expect to pay $23 at the door.  That really sucked.  I only had
$22 on me so I borrowed a buck from Stef and went in.  They didn't even
have the whole club open, just the front room.  So it got really crowded
and made it really hard to dance.  The sound system was the worst I've
ever heard.  Kinda reminds me of the old sound system at the Avenue in
Kent.  And the worst part was this mega big fog machine that spouted out
a choking cloud of fog directly in my face every 2 minutes.  
 
Ok, enough bitching.  Now comes the good part.  
 
Goldie fucking rocked.  It was my first time seeing him and I was
extremely impressed.  He spun for nearly 3 hours straight and drop some
hard ass d&b that got right into your head and played games with your
brain.  I could help but to bounce up and down on the dance floor thru
most of his set.  It was nice to see a lot of people I knew, including
Silverraver, and a bunch of other nonlisties.  I heard Ray was there but
never did end up running into him.  
 
I'm going to be posting pictures of the event on my website
(www.pookaville.net <http://www.pookaville.net/> ) in a few.  I must
warn you though; it was my first outing with my new camera so they're a
bit blurry.  I'm still experimenting around trying to learn the camera.
 
B.J.

Subject: {pb-cle} goldie review

overall great show, nice part atmosphere, no underage kids getting 
dragged out in handcuffs like other heaven and earth shows I remember.

the price was a bit steep, I expected maybe $15 but oh well

goldie might be a good DJ but he was not showing it last night, he 
hardly mixed any records together, there were tons of gaps between tracks.

the sound in heaven and earth is cool if you are in the middle of the 
dancefloor but it sucks everywhere else, I don't know if the promoters 
rented sound or what?

nice to see lotsa people at a party again.

he has a long standing reputation for not mixing at all, even
going to the point that at some festival a few years ago, he would
stand there with his arms raised in the air after each song while
people cheered, then would drop the needle on the next record.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Kazaa


I've only gotten like 2 viruses from kazaa in few years of constant 
download.  Both of the virus were detected and quarentined by norton 
antivirus active protection while they were still dat files.

I don't think they'll be able to stop peer to peer.  distributed computing 
and networks is just efficient.  its actually faster and easier to steal 
music, movies, software, and porn, with p2p networks than it is to have go 
out and to buy it.

if its just people and not companies using whats uptained on p2p systems i 
totally suport it.  If these companies get involved they always make a 
horrible mess if it.

Yea, I did find that interesting, he did that whole  "zzzzzzit" thing with
the needle scratching off the record after almost every track.  Not being
the biggest dnb expert, I did enjoy his track selection though.  Did he
write that "Nitrous" track?

Does anyone know who was on at like 11? they were spinning some NICE acid.

Nitrous is from Bad Company. Its on "Inside the Machine"

Quality grits.

"Son of Nitrous" is on "Digital Nation" also good.

There are spots on those tracks where an unexpected triplet is introduced 
and, to me, it gives the feel that the track is tripping over itself. Then 
its right back on point. Dark and Lovely.

check out my slsk for copies of both

Subject: {pb-cle} greedy "musicians"

all i have to say about all this music industry
bullshit is that no artist can really claim ownership
of anything that they put out in my opinion for the
following reason: anything you "create" is only the
regurgitation of influences, so it's merely then a
reconstituted, recycled, paraphrased version of
somebody else's "creation." unless you can claim (and
prove) that there is something in there that came from
some "you" which existed before you were physically
born then it's simply not yours. now, if you can get
people to give you money for that, more power to you,
but this idea of the "right" to make money solely and
exclusively on that is simply bogus intellectual
tyranny, and i say fuck that. the record industry
needs to be destroyed, and maybe then music will be
art again, rather than just a demographically
conceived, target marketed product. 
that's just my opinion, but i felt it should at least
be put on the table.
peace and happy new year
colin pierce

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} greedy "musicians"



Unfortunately, we don't live in a communist society, so your utopia isn't 
going to happen any time soon.

Since we're all in this capitalist system for a while, I'l all in favor of 
artists getting paid for their work.  You argue that artists don't create 
anything, they just regurgitate influences.  While that may be true, (And 
very postmodern) it doesn't have anything to do with the economics.  Artists 
do work, and they should get paid for it.  Some artists do work that a lot 
of people like, and they should get paid a lot for it.

Obviously, some artists are happy not to be paid much for what they do.  
That's fine for them, and after they're dead they'll probably get some 
recognition.  But, everybody needs to live, and I don't think it's right 
that a talented artist is likely to end up making less than a kroger cashier 
from their work....

-Dave

like selling jeff storm mechandise? 

really, i thought i had dropped any antagonism towards you a good

discussion going about your dumb posts and how they make no real 
sense, and its just being antagonistic towards me for no good 
reason. youre bringing this on yourself.

You feel the need to point out anything anybody says that is dumb to you.
You are so far up your own in denial ass you can't see straight.  I've
watched you burn virtually every person on this list and I'm antagonizing
you?  All that anger and hate mr.death email address is inside of you not
me.  You have some serious issues you need to deal with.  If trolling and
flaming other people on the internet is the only way you can feel
good/better about yourself you really need to work these issues out.

I don't deny that you feel strongly about music and I've enjoyed some of
your posts on the subject but you find your happiness in strange places.
You don't want to boycott major labels then don't.  I was being short
because I'm not going to argue with you nor am I going to impose my views on
you and say "you are stupid for not seeing things my way."  If you don't
want to boycott then don't.

And how do your arguments hold any water?  You cloud every argument in a
bath of personal attacks.  Ok, I'm done with this your email address is
filtered out.  You are irrelevant.

I agree... I'm filtering you out too... i always think  'damn this guy is so 
hateful' ... what he needs is an internet punching bag and a penis enlarger 
... since your blatant disregard for others is the obvious result of personal 
inadequacy ... and as jeff suggests 'mental fucking help'

luckily, I wont get to hear your childish response because you are blocked!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kazaa

2 key things to remember when reading a tom cox post:

1)  When he is singling you out, he rarely is  talking shit, rather
challenging you to step discussion up to another level higher than that of
your average list raver; whether or not you heed that is up to your personal
diligence.

2) There is always something underlying that you must discover and
comprehend or else all you will see is 'personal attacks' and 'difference of
opinion'.

the justin timberlake track 'like i love you' is the hot shit, worthy of
being discussed here because it has a deep dish and basement jaxx remix
(that i know of, there are probably more) and i dont really think that
either artist would waste their time remixing something that was garbage.

SoulSeek

This thing is seriously the shit.  I spent weeks looking for a couple of
rare tracks on both Kazaa and WinMX, was told about SoulSeek whilst I
was off doing a show in Minneapolis, and one download later I find about
a dozen copies of said rare, newer records.

The album has an all-star roster of production talent. When you're working
with Pharell or Timbaland you're going to put out good tracks. I don't know
that Justin is so special, but his producers right now certainly are, and
unless the aforementioned artists are remixing acapellas, it might be said
that Justin's daisy-powered voice isn't the primary appeal.

A project I'd really like to see would be a track-off between, say, Pharell
and Timbaland (VA, east coast) and Bosko and Dr. Dre (CA, west coast). VA
produces a track (01) and then CA remixes it (02), and then CA produces a
track (03) and VA remixes it (04). You put out about 12 or 16 songs like
that on an LP and I think it would rock. Guest emcees are definitely allowed
for producers AND remixers.

Subject: {pb-cle} P2P and the RIAA

Lots of good debate here, so I'm compelled to chime in as well...

Whoever said something about 5 a track (Goose?) was definitely on to
something.

What we're seeing here in all the P2P stuff and CD burning and all of that
is the obsoletion of record companies. Unless they're pressing vinyl, the
actual physical media has no value, because anybody with a few dollars to
spend can burn CD's or dub tapes or whatever. Load the shit up in your
Phatbox. The same technology that made the DVD possible has made
shrink-wrapped CD's insignificant, and when we start melting down the
thermoplastic and jewel cases and process color ink on 24# notecards with
text so small it's unintelligible, all that's left is guitar players,
drummers, production and post-production people, emcees and the like. Those
people DO deserve rewards because they actually GENERATE the music that
we're after.

The RIAA attacks P2P under the guise that they're helping the artists, but
what they're really trying to do is save their own jobs. The recording
industry has built up this enormously complex castle on proprietary
technologies and distribution protocols whose time is now coming to an end.
At some time someone has said something about building castles in sand, but
oh well... I guess it's going to be their loss. I don't think that all of
the lobbying and pocket-lining in Washington is going to help them, and
what's ultimately likely to happen is that the artists learn how to whore
themselves so that they can do away with their high-priced pimps.

I've watched MTV cribs - I've seen the production studios that people have
in their basements, and there is absolutely no reason that tracks can't go
DIRECTLY from Snoop Dogg's basement mixing board to my HP7200i+ (yes, I'm
that ancient - I'll probably buy a new one this week). The problem is
figuring out how I can compensate the artist for this music, and more
importantly, after I've done so how I can be prevented from sharing it with
the millions upon millions of users of Kazaa. Digital encryption and copy
protection - these are the tools of $uce$$ful mu$ician$ in the 21st century.

You know, only 150 years ago the primary challenge in the world of music
(with regards to technology) was developing a method to record sounds and
ultimately to distribute these recordings. Now the primary challenge (with
regards to technology) seems to be how to STOP people from doing this. I'm
sure there are enough smart engineers at Sony and Philips to pull this off,
but if anybody thinks they're going to do it by changing a world in which
ANYTHING that can be translated into ones and zeros can be distributed and
redistributed at rates which would make Fibonacci quiver, then they're
barking up the wrong tree as much as I love long sentences.

Five cents a song is about on par with what the artist gets from CD sales,
so let's be the generous internet generation that we are and give them 10 a
song and as soon as this technology is implemented we will begin. Until
then, I guess record execs can smoke their cigars and watch their market
shares go down the big fiberoptic drain that is the internet.

"Josh and his road to Mrjvel"

So what you're trying to say is "the answer isnt in the box, it's in the
band"?..  And in that, I had stated earlier that most artists still make the
vast majority of their money from touring.  The more popularity that the
band gets, the more shows they get booked for.  The higher demand to see
said artist will dictate ticket price.  The tools for promotion are what can
be honed.  There is no reason to pay for play on the radio when there is a
better promotion tool available, the internet.  Soon enough our generation
will be grown up reliant upon digital music downloads and the older
generation that buys cd's will start to diminish in numbers.  The younger
heads will grow up in even thicker technological influence.  Broadband has
spread so fast that it's almost to status of staple utility in nearly every
household.  Let's take an example of success via internet promotion.  It's
the best one i could think of, and it's even from a couple of years ago.
When Sonique released 'Feels So Good' as a free download on mp3.com, that
shit flew across oceans and people dug it.  Bookings ensued and she made
some money touring.  CD sales went up once it hit the radio waves, with
little record label promotion needed.  This to me only proved that the
internet is the tool of promotion that leaves the least amount of expenses,
and the highest payback to the artist.  It's not too much about finding an
encryption method that could be used for the regulation of copyrighted
works, rather in finding a system that promotes the music and is a catalyst
for city to city tours.  I believe that the p2p system offers this when used
in conjunction with a well designed artist webpage.  The only other system
that i can think of to actually get funds to the artist is to have agents of
the ASCAP and BMI take visits to danceclubs where the dj's use cd-r's.  the
club could opt to purchase a mass performance license (which i'm pretty sure
is supposed to happen anyway, but i'm curious as to how well this is
actually enforced.<?>), or the dj could purchase the license for the year,
but if they were not licensed, then they could hand out stiff penalties.
(just another idea)

Cheers

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} P2P and the RIAA

and one other idea is to add a 2-3 dollar surcharge on broadband bills as
permission to download music per month, with that money being distributed to
ASCAP/BMI.  I'm sure that each broadband provider could set up servers for
peer to peer sharing that could monitor and document which artists receive
the most downloads and the information could be transmitted to each artist
representation organization to help them pay out to their artists in a
prorated manner.  If you're gonna pay the 2-3 dollars per month anyways, i
dont see a reason why people wouldnt take advantage of the tools that could
be offered by their ISP instead of going to an independent p2p network.  I'm
sure that the independent p2p networks can document their transfers as well
and forward the information when there is no threat of being sued by the
RIAA.

I've only gotten like 2 viruses from kazaa in few years of constant 
download.  Both of the virus were detected and quarentined by norton 
antivirus active protection while they were still dat files.

I don't think they'll be able to stop peer to peer.  distributed
computing 
and networks is just efficient.  its actually faster and easier to steal

music, movies, software, and porn, with p2p networks than it is to have
go 
out and to buy it.

if its just people and not companies using whats uptained on p2p systems
i 
totally suport it.  If these companies get involved they always make a 
horrible mess if it.

Subject:  {pb-cle} Track ID?

At the Holiday Partae at BB Mclain's on 12/26 I heard a track that I really
liked.  It was at 10:45 or so before the band came on the stage.

What was unusual about this track was the bass line sounded like someone was
playing big diameter rubber hoses with a drumstick, possibly in a
configuration like a xylophone or tubular bells.  No idea if this was for
real or a sample.

I know this is a longshot, but can anyone name the tune?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kazaa

Here's my opinion of it all.

True enought that P2Ping has really hurt the music industry.  We have been
over that time and time again here.  Record labels won't invest in smaller
artists anymore because if they do, they won't profit as much as they will
by investing in one or two superstars who still sell CD's to the
unintelligent sector of public that don't know how to p2p.  I said it three
years ago... I'm sure country music isn't affected too much by mp3s.

Back in the day, mp3/software trading was done in manners which required a
bit of net saavyness.  NOW, any retard with a broadband connection and
kazaa/slsk can steal music/software.  There are those out there who are
intelligent enough to understand how it works and still claim to purchase
music, the vast majority however do not.

When napster got shut down we saw a definite increase in singles sales until
people found out about audio galaxy.  Then when audio galaxy became
irrelevant we saw another increase.  Now every lamer knows about kazaa/slsk
and cd sales are back in the gutter.   I say do away with stupid p2p
software and let people trade mp's on irc/ftp/buddy groups. That way at
least pseudo intelligent people are doing the downloading instead of every
lamer who could afford to buy the music/software in the first place  Its a
great system that way, because the people who unknowingly view amassing
mp3's as status will eventually get shut down.  The network stays smaller,
its more effective, and people still make money.

Oh, I read something the other day that really rang true to me.  In
billboard magazine Rob DiStefano, former owner of tribal america and current
owner of twisted records had a brilliant quote... paradon my paraphrasing...
"The well of electronic music is running dry and people are running from it
seeking a new well.  I don't drink from the well, instead concentrate on
filling it back up".  This is so true in so many aspects.  There are the
"search of status" style dj who use electronic music as their way to fame
and do nothing to forward its progression and effictively limit its
potential.   There are the record lables who slap the word "IBIZA" on their
lame ass compilations in gay marketing attempts.   There are the djs who
don't buy music and just play free mp3.. talk about bleeding the well dry.

Oh well, just some cracked out sunday afternoon comments from me.

Yeah... that IS a longshot. I'm having difficulty understanding what you are
talking about.

The only thing that possibly rings a bell are the (igloo? derrick carter?
greenskeepers?) remixs of Love Cats by The Cure.

Should be a dope party, good music, sound and lighting, stable venue(which is being decorated like I've never seen it before, should surprise some people) and CBS knows how to throw a New Years Eve Bash(I know some of you were at the first Nuevo)...if anyone on here from up north heads down for this, feel free to come by and say 'hi'.  I'll be at the door from opening time to about 11 slappin wristbands on people and probably out and about the party taking pictures most of the rest of the night and will most definitely be up front shakin my ass when Boo Williams takes the decks.

But again, any fee, from $10 to $.05 is non-enforceable.... as soon as Snoop=

But when rumours start that the FBI are creating some internet monitoring=20
system, most people freak out and say it's invasive.... I doubt they'd let
RIAA set up some monitoring thing, too... I think that's out.

Broadband and CD-R tax period end dot. I think it's the only way to go.

You stupid fuck, I am speaking of personal experience and produced numbers
relative to my store the LAST time I had this debate with you.

Also, rumors of mp3 viruses sent old customers scurrying into the store for
a minute to buy cd's as well.  I had three customers, who I haden't seen in
1.5 years come in and spend 200+ $ each on new music because "they were
afraid to download" for a hot minute.   Rumors of hard drive eating mp3
virus's were spreading in that community.  And cd single sales went up
during THAT time frame as well.

Ditto there, and I've even downloaded software.  That's what they 
have anti-virus software for.  But, like I said, it has never gone 
off as a result of downloading something from kazaa

That's how I use to be, I probably bought more cds as a result of 
listening to mp3s then I did before hand.  I'm not like that now, 
though.  I have not bought a cd from a 'major' artist for at least a 
year.  Anything I buy now are the mix sets that are also cheaper for 
more music (alot of them come with 2 or more cds but are the price of 
1).

I first got started on irc, and I still check there every once and a 
while.  But with all these p2p programs, you can get more rare, 
harder to find tracks or live sets.  You even said it, the network 
would be smaller, so it would be harder to find a certain song.

Also, i'm all for sending money right to the artist per song.  So if 
there's one song I really like, I'll send him $1 or whatever.  What I 
am not for is the taxation of cd-rs.  I can't even remember the last 
time I used a cd r to make a music cd.  The two main things I use 
cdrs for is to backup my files and to put software I have download 
onto disc.  I guess I should mention that I do occasionaly backup 
mp3s I downloaded, but they are mainly the harder to find livesets 
and whatnot, and they stay in mp3 form.  But I would say at least 80% 
of the cd's I have contain nothing that deals with music or mp3s, and 
I shouldn't have to pay a tax when i don't even use them for purposes 
of copying music.

We were thinking about going to this, but I'm terrified that it's
going to get busted. Why? Because raves in Ohio get busted, and last
year there was a NYE party in Dayton that got busted. I went to the
first Nuevo, and it was fun, but I'm *really* iffy about travelling
all the way down to Dayton again with the possibility of getting
stuck out on NYE with nowhere to go and nothing to do because the
cops decide to shut the party down.

umm, I didn't write this. Just a little slander from tom.  not surprising.
If somebody nailed my mental state down as well as I did to him the only
thing I could do to "get back at him" would be putting words in his mouth
and seeing if people believed that he said these things.  The good news is
that my filters work.  I didn't even know he sent this till "Ben Storm"
replied.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} P2P and the RIAA

I think this is a pretty damn solid idea Goose. It could be set up in the 
vein of usenet. Every person with an ISP, save the AOL & lowest cost 
alternatives such as Juno, is paying for a news server with their monthly 
fee. I imagine the percentage of people who are aware of this, and actually 
utilize it, is in the single digits or low teens.

Those of us that have actually bothered digging around in the news groups 
know that you can get just about ANYTHING for free. Thousands upon thousands 
of studio albums, bootlegs, movie rips, utility and entertainment software, 
operating systems, pr0n, etc. I am talking about EVERYTHING and you're 
already paying for it. If you don't know about this stuff, get a copy of 
FreeAgent newsreader and dig around. You'll never bother visiting some 
crappy warez site again. You can find it at, http://www.forteinc.com

I think setting up an ASCAP/BMI approved news server is a simple, effective 
alternative. We could be given access to several levels of encoding, bonus 
materials, etc. Downloads can easliy be tracked and there could be a monthly 
fee for this access. If people who don't use the stuff want to bitch, or if 
some people seem to be abusing the system, bill for the downloads 
individually! Its the digital supply chain of the future, and its partially 
what the Internet is designed for. Think of the hundreds of millions of 
dollars that would be saved annually on raw media, recording, printing, 
packaging, warehousing, fuel, vehicle wear & tear, etc, etc. Not to mention 
the impact on the environment that all this shipping has.

Sure Sarah Jane might not have that job over at Camelot music much longer, 
and Billy Bob might have to deliver something other than crates of compact 
discs, but those jobs were never guaranteed. You can't block people from 
using technologically available alternatives because the people employed by 
an ancient supply chain may be put out of work. Talk to the letter carriers 
about layoffs since electronic mail became so popular.

Until then, I'll still be getting my stuff off alt.binaries.mp3s, 
alt.binaries.jungle, alt.binaries.vcd, and 
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.*pickafetish*

and one other idea is to add a 2-3 dollar surcharge on broadband bills as
permission to download music per month, with that money being distributed to
ASCAP/BMI.  I'm sure that each broadband provider could set up servers for
peer to peer sharing that could monitor and document which artists receive
the most downloads and the information could be transmitted to each artist
representation organization to help them pay out to their artists in a
prorated manner.  If you're gonna pay the 2-3 dollars per month anyways, i
dont see a reason why people wouldnt take advantage of the tools that could
be offered by their ISP instead of going to an independent p2p network.  I'm
sure that the independent p2p networks can document their transfers as well
and forward the information when there is no threat of being sued by the
RIAA.

Heather, are you a Fark photoshopper? You're hitting a lot of coincidental

Anyone going to Peabody's for New Years Eve?  I just saw in The Scene what is going on there for the big night.  No big headliners, some good locals though (7up, Rob Black, Mike Philly, etc.).  Plus a free champagne toast along with some crazy stuff like magicians, fire breathers, stilt walkers, and fortune tellers?!  Hmmm........

The best part about it though is that it is Free!  I know that I would much rather go to a party with good talent, a decent venue, and not have to pay a cover than spend $50+ for "atmosphere" at a club.  If anyone one is going hit me up!

Cheers,

Marisa

How many of you are downloading Paul McCartny songs anyway?

The people complaining are fucking greedy bastards who already sell =
millions of CD's anyway.  Fuck them.  Just take a look at who is =
bitching in the press, and don't buy from them.  Gee, and who is that?  =
Metallica, Eminem, and Brittany Spears.  How many of you buy their CD's =
now anyway?

The only person I'd have a tough time not buying is Dr. Dre, but he =
never releases shit anyway.  2 albums in 10 years?

  I think artists need to stop thinking they'll become millionaires
  by releasing albums and get back to (GASP) PERFORMING

Did you ever stop to think that MAYBE the reason you hear "greedy bastards
who sell millions of CD'S" complaining is because they are the ones the
media chooses to acknowlege?  The complaint won't mean as much coming from
smaller unknown artists.  When the smaller unknown artists  complain, then
they get accused of being ladder climbers... stopyour bitching... you suck
anyways.  So its the age old addage the if the superstars complain the kids
will listen to their "idols".

personally i like the anti-piracy ads i hear on 1100 am here in cleveland.
those are effective to me.

How many of you are downloading Paul McCartny songs anyway?

The people complaining are fucking greedy bastards who already sell millions
of CD's anyway.  Fuck them.  Just take a look at who is bitching in the
press, and don't buy from them.  Gee, and who is that?  Metallica, Eminem,
and Brittany Spears.  How many of you buy their CD's now anyway?

The only person I'd have a tough time not buying is Dr. Dre, but he never
releases shit anyway.  2 albums in 10 years?

If I owned a record label, I would flood the p2p market with

There's just as many "idols" talking the other way about how great mp3's =
and digital downloading is.

When someone is selling 10 million copies, and selling out tours, how =
much money are they really losing in the long run.  I never said boycott =
everyone, just the ones speaking out.

I like the anti-piracy ads about as much as I like Fox News.

I'm glad to know I suck.

Here here! Let's close all record stores so that no one can buy
records! Great idea ... Doug Burkhart is such an idiot -- what does
he know anyway! Yeah! Fight the power!

wow, that is the most profoundly dumb statement ever to come out of your
mouth (yes, it was THAT dumb).

just because YOU dont buy records doesnt mean there isnt a demand for them.
what do you do for a living?  i bet it's possible to have some argument
about your profession or lack thereof.

Keoki is GOD

You are a fucking moron.

You call record stores part of the problem?  It's retail, pal.  In case your
closed mind didn't know -- most retail stores survive on %100 markup.
Record stores work off a %40 markup, and in the Electronic Music industry
you are not allowed to return shit/unsold product, and have to deal with
assholes like you who think you know it all in your quest for you own
personal 15 minutes of fame.  Big fucking deal to you, I'm sure.  But this
is my heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears.  I'm not complaining in this
thread only offerring suggestions.  I do this because I love it, and at one
point  I loved more than I do now.   I don't make money at this and can
barely afford to live right now.   In fact, I may have to look for another
dj gig to survive which would take a job from one other dj buying records
and that's the last thing I want to do.  Stupid ignorant people like you
make me want to firebomb my own store and say FUCK YOU DUMB FUCKS I could
care less.  But what good would that do?  None.  It wouldn't hurt you in the
least.   Go back under your rock and come out when you have a clue and say
can something intelligent.  Or why don't you say what is REALLY on your
mind?  My door is open.

I agree that music is art, but that does not mean you have to be a starving
artist.  I'm telling you how things are, and trying to offer suggestions and
advice based on what I have learned.  Why don't you say something that might
be a bit relevant or take the time to know what is up before you open your
mouth?

Since you did not include text from any previous message, how were we
supposed to know you were talking about p2p and not record stores, or
the music industry in general?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kazaa

the chain of heads making loot from the sale of physical records
is why there is an "industry" to get angry about the lack of
record sales in the first place. a record shop gets the records
from a distributor, who buys the records from the label, who gets
the records pressed at a pressing plant and who pays an artist for
the label/sleeve design and who pays for advertisements in genre
magazines which are basically a way for labels to sell their
shite. how many negative reviews do you see in dance magazines?
ha. mad people leech off of artists, and thats mainly who is
complaining. the artists make the vast majority of their loot from
touring and t-shirt sales. i dont see that changing any time soon.
the only artists who dont make their money that way are the
already established artists that the major labels shell out mad
loot to for long term guaranteed album contracts. fuck those people.

Actually, last years NYE bash down here was in downtown Cincinnati, not 
Dayton, that and the fact that the promoters of last years NYE event were 
complete idiots is why it got shut down.  Dayton is a pretty safe place to 
throw parties, this venue has never had an event shut down to my 
knowledge(at least in the last 3 years).

doug doug doug. no offence to you because you know i love record
shops and i love deejaying, but every single penny you make is at
the expense of an artist who goes and makes the tunes. without the
artists, there is nothing. record stores, deejays, whatever dont
mean shit if there arent good tunes to be had. and the artists are
the ones getting shafted by the huge percentages of shelf prices
being taken by the "industry" before they see any profit from
records. really, i think that the prices now being charged for
music are outrageous for the most part, and thats the fault of the
industry being huge and bloated. the extra cash certainly isnt
going to the artists and by the looks of things its not going to
new artist development either. its being eaten up by business men
making trying to (or even succeeding in) make money off of the
backs of talented artists. so if youre going to complain, dont
complain about people who are trying to get music for more like
what its worth with P2P filesharing programs. get angry at the
fuckheads who are jacking up the prices of what you need to sell
to the point that people would rather get it for free...........

Chris...you get all bitchy when people mis-interpret you
supposedly...but you almost never say what you mean.  You never state
anything clearly and rarely elaborate.  All you do is come back with
insults and direct statements without explaining what you mean or why
you believe that.  Then you get mad when people don't get you!  If you
want someone to agree with something you have to say, you should always
explain why you think that way.  Back it up.  Be specific.  Do your
homework.  That way you don't get burned and come off like a complete
nitwit.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kazaa

Where was my attititude part of the problem?

I said A)  If I were a record company I would turn p2ping into
advertisements.

I said B)  P2P clients like kaza and soulseek are stupid because lame people
can easily download music, as opposed to years ago when you had to have half
a brain.

I said:  When napster shut down, cd single sales went up.

I alluded to the fact that p2ping has not hurt vinyl sales as much.  In the
past I have said that the cd sales is what allowed us, as a store, to
diversify our vinyl selection and take chances with unknown artitsts and
lables.  So maybe p2ping replaced that -- for some people -- but the people
who choose NOT to p2p are the once suffering.

I also quoted a billboard magazine article.

And I wasn't trying to solicite business... if i were I would be putting my
stores' name and address in this post.

Do you think an artist would make more money without a record lable?  Record
labels as we know it would get replaced by people who provide "marketing" as
a service.   So basically a different type of record lable would be formed.
We would have a whole new system with a whole new set of problems, and a
different group of people getting rich off these artists who have no concern
for the greater good of the now non-existent music industry.

How is it at the "expense" of the artist anyways?   The artist provides the
music and he gets compensated and everyone down the line gets paid.  Now,
elminating some of the hands down the line... that works.  Elminating
retail, that certainly lowers cost... but in the case of Best Buy and the
likes of that you are already buying it for the same price I am.  In many
cases it is cheaper for me to go to best buy to purchase music for my store.
But whatever, I'm trying not to bitch.

Yeah... I feel ya.  I was just telling what I would do.  With advertisements
for singles, like i was talking about, the sales would once again increase.
Many of my former cd customers went to p2p because they could get stuff
BEFORE it was available in the stores.

One thing that would dramatically help... if they would provide software and
licensing so that retail stores could custom burn cd's.  If I could get new
"madonna dance mixes" as soon as they were done and burn them for customers
legally, the system as I see it is on the road to getting fixed.  Its fucked
up, that's all.   If I'm going to burn cd's for customers, why not eliminate
the retail... sure i understand that.  But there are just as many people out
there who are NOT net savvy.  I have customers all the time who ask me to
burn stuff for them, but i don't because I have too many hangups about it.
Then again I sell bootleg cd's with unreleased dance mixes -- the artist
gets burned -- but really i think the lable gets burned in that sense for
not making the product available for purchase.

In some aspects I am all for p2ping, however, the DIS-inormation that gets
spread out there in p2p land is amazing.  In the case of DANCE music, the
artist gets completely lost.  If bad boy bill plays a new track by say
MOLOKO, then the kids all think its bad boy bill and not moloko.  Some
retards even list it in p2pland as a bad boy bill track.  So what does THAT
do for the original artists.  Does anyone care to fix that?   What happens
when dj "x" puts out a mix cd of other people tracks and builds himself up
with internet hype as the original artists?   I have seen that with local
djs time and time again.  People will come up while i am playing ask for
"overhyped local dj x" and I say "overyhped local dj x" doesn't make music.
And they say "No, your wrong, you don't know shit.  I have his cd.  I want
you to play that song "Shut the fuck up and dance" by "overhyped local dj
x".  The same thing happens in P2P land.   "I just download everybody's free
by louie devito online and i want you to play it".

The worst thing about P2P is that it gives your average joe with a computer
and a high speed internet connection the ability to spread whatever
propaganda they want.  Some people do it innocently, but just wait until
shadey people come along.

I am reposting the second part of my response to Tom because I think it
makes some GREAT point..


In some aspects I am all for p2ping, however, the DIS-inormation that gets

The worst thing about P2P is that it gives your average joe with a computer

shadey socially campaigning ladder climbers come along with their

"madonna dance mixes" as soon as they were done and burn them for customers
legally, the system as I see it is on the road to getting fixed.

I know, just let the consumer burn their own cd... eliminate retail. Some
people _do_ want to walk into a store and buy a cd so ther e is no hassle.
If we could have access to burn specific versions and mixes for the
consumer, the consumer would be very happy.  Think of what it could do for
legitimizing dj mix cd's if it is a properly done?

One other thing about online to make it come full circle.  Do away with
labels and let artists sell their own wares themself.  You are still going
to have artists who don't want to participate in p2p.  They are going to
want to hire "marketing experts" like I said before.  And so the circle
continues.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} cubase


Go cubase SX for sure.  Its really quite nice.  I used to be a cakewalker 
and into acid type programs yet the the new cubase can do just about what 
ever i need.

keep in mind that free space for the program is nothing to the amount of 
space you'll need for audio data and mix downs.  Cubase SX also has the 
feature of unlimited undo commands so all the orginal recording waves are 
still there unless you freeze edits and choose to clean up files and 
orphans.

if you use cubase youll have a blast using the vst instruments and samplers. 
  I'm using mostly battery, hallion, absynth, FM7... and learning reaktor.  
hit me back if you have any questions on using cubase, i use it much.

plenty of small labels have gotten by with little to no
advertising, and they are generally the people who compensate the
artists the most, since they have less middle men to pay. and with
digital mediums, all middle men are cut out: a band could go and
record their entire album at their home studio, mix it down and
master it on a computer, and set it up on their personal website
for DLing at a small charge, and by moving 1000 DLs make more than
theyd make selling 10,000 units for a small label. especially in
dance music, the labels usually pay out a one time payment and
then retain the licensing and publishing rights. maintaining all
of that alone would be worth it to the artists, ask anyone who has
been shafted down the line by a label who still owns the master
tapes of their most profitable recordings while they got paid jack
shit for them back when they were released.........

the artist is doing all the work that is possible ONLY because of
their particular set of talents and circumstances. the rest of it
is purely "business" people looking to get paid from selling
someone else's talents. and please, dont try to justify business
as a talent.

 In many

no matter what the problem is, its not the P2P filesharing! its
greed by a whole buttload of people who are truly doing nothing at
all related to actual making of music. its such a joke. id love to
see all those jokers get cut out of the deal, they deserve it for
being talentless uncreative pussies.

the radio does a damn good job of advertising singles. i cant tell
you how many times ive wanted to just pick up a CD single of some
hiphop track ive heard, only to find its either a $7.99 "maxi"
single with 5 remixes i dont care about on it or that its only
avaliable on the $17.99 LP that i REALLY dont give a shit about. i
can remember when just about any single you would hear on the
radio would be avaliable on cassette single for the pretty nice
price of 2 for $3 in the early 90's. i bought assloads of singles
then. its not the same now, and because of that and the wack
albums that accompany even some of the most brilliant singles, its
just not economically sound to spend loot on them. 

getting things before hand is really not even an issue. i know
plenty of people got advance bootlegs copies of many hiphop albums
long before they came out and they still sold a buttload of
copies. making music that is not so trendy is one solution, but
that involves investing in artist development, which no one wants
to do anymore.

yeah ive always been in support of that kind of idea. its what
makes those NOW comps so damn popular, you can get an album's
worth of every hot single out for $18, thats approximately what
theyre actually worth to most people.

the thing is, there will be less and less music buyers who are not
net savvy. most adults dont spend shit on music compared to
younger people. and those that do will eventually figure their way
out as the technology becomes more and more ingrained in society
(imagine when cars come standard with a big LCD screen and a USB

this has been a problem as long as mix CD's have been gaining
popularity. shit, i can remember people coming into record shops
asking for the new dj dan record or whatever, meaning something
they heard him spin at some dumb fucking rave. there's really
nothing you can do to get around the public's stupiditiy about
electronic music, thats something that everyone who gets involved
with making the music should understand if theyre not morons. the
producers often get totally overlooked for no good reason.
filsharing has nothing to do with that.

like i said, this is a problem even with moonshine level artists.
average people cant bend their minds around the idea that
electronic music is made by some reclusive fucker in a home
studio, pressed in limited quantity on vinyl only, bought up
immediately by anorak deejays, and then spun out with no
widespread respect for the actual artist who made it in the first
place.

eh, too many people are just too stupid to care about what's

stupidity now that everyone can get it 24/7 at their computer.

It depends on what level you are at sure.  But tell me that as soon as you
destroy the current music industry your not going to have a new one develop.
Musicians _still_ need to market themselves one way or the other to become
known.

I didn't say P2p is the problem but it has sure shaken things up quite a
bit.  In many cases it is the problem though.

HA HA HA.   You don't get it do you?
RADIO determines what it will play based largely on SOUNDSCAN sales and huge
research departments.  RECORD LABELS pay off record stores to "doctor" the
soundscan charts.  Things were way better off without computer sales
analysis, because unknown artists really did get a fair shake --- from
record store owners/tastemakers who reported what was good along with what
they got paid to report.  Then more obscure stuff got on the radio and the
TOP40 charts were in state of progression instead of a state where its
progression is limited to what the record labels feed them.  We are talking
about a change that happened almost a decade ago.  I've explained this time
and time again.

I never bought singles, I always bought the album or the maxi.   CD SINGLES
were another way the system was manipulated heavily.  Most stores got them
for free and it was %100 profit because of soundscan.  They would scan the
single and the radio would se it was doing good and have to add it.

With dance mixes, if a dj plays something 3 months before it is available to
purchase... and it is available through p2p the whole time... there is an
issue.

Yes it does.  It validates the dis-infomation.  "It must be true, i saw it
on the internet".

How is he the biggest pussy?  And how does have have nothing more to say
than insults?  I think mike has contributed a lot.  Maybe his only
responses to your posts are insults...I don't know, but I wouldn't be
surprised...

You must not read enough.  Mike doesn't post all that much, except about
events and to share him opinion/knowledge when it comes to music.  But he
certainly contributes to discusssion.  Chris, you never contribute to
discussion.  Ever.  You like to spout shit off, then have people call you
on your bs, and get pissy about it.  You're such a drama queen.  Wake up
Chris...you're not Eminem, although I know you try to act tough like him. 
You just make yourself look like a fool and hence people make fun of you
more.

See?  What's the point in this.  You know you didn't.  He knows you
didn't?  You didn't actually dis him by saying you.  You just made
yourself sound like you're still 15.

Celeste and all.

I dont fucking care honestly.  I've given up on trying to just discuss.  I do. I know I do.  Even Ed knows I do.  anyways, anytime I say anything SOMEWHAT controversial, I get shit on.  I dont care.  Fuck it.  even Tom doesnt get absolute negativity like I do.

this whole list can blow me. Well.

and this Mike Salamon due... hes never done anything but annoy me.  Hes lame.  oh well.  MY OPINION.

and I aint Eminem.  NOR do I "act tough" like 'Eminem'. I can back up whatever I say.  So, again this list can blow me.

I can find out bout events elsewhere.

peace. to yall. for a good while.

Stanton Groovemaster II's:

Ortofon Concorde Nightclubs:

http://www.ortofon.com/html/body_disco_sets.html?varenr=0140025

All of your opinions on these, as well as other any other catridges would be 
greatly appreciated. I haven't learn how to interpret the technical data...

I currently own a pair of used Ortofon Concorde Blues... they are giving me 
some trouble (I have to blow on them probably once every couple of records) 
and I am considering purchasing a set of brand new cartrdiges (I may just 
need to get the contacts cleaned - advice would help)

I do not scratch...I would be looking for ideal needles tailored for 
club/mixing.

thanks in advance...

What a horrible night to have a curse.

So why would anyone use this instead of Kazaa or soulseek or Limewire or
whatever the next one is? Any time that one service is shut down,
another will just appear that will be even harder to stop. It doesn't
really matter what they do now because people are getting used to the
idea of free music, and will continue to seek it out.

I think I've bought 1 cd in the past 2 years, and don't see any reason
to buy them in the future.

They've tried that. The tracks get deleted and don't propagate because
nobody but that one server is offering them. Besides, in Limewire you
can do a bitzi lookup on a track that is listed for download and compare
it to a database of known good tracks. If it shows up, you've got the
right track. If not, you still might.

If they had someone smart doing it, the "advertisement" would be the correct
size -- and it would be served by a bunch of servers.  I know that most of
my former cd maxi customers choose p2p because of availabilty of dance
mixes.  Independent lables don't release them reliably, and consumers get
very frustrated if they hear something in the club and can't go out and buy
it.  If they _knew_ the realase date, they would be happier.  In the case of
my store... 90% of the time we don't know when a single is going to be
available until the day before we get it.  I bet if a major label tried this
strategy, they would see dramatic sales increases in singles.

However, as I think about it -- realistically I think they need to allow for
track licensing to individuals on a per burn instance.   Consumers pay x
amount for it, while retailers pay a lower amount.  Retailers can the make
compilations or burn legal mixed cd's for local djs.  The reason I keep
retailers in this loop is not because I am one, but because I realize that
many people don't have high speed access and don't want to go through the
hassle.  Having a building or reliable place to go for this service is of
value to a consumer.  Fly by night people selling them out of the their
college dorms isn't as productive. Also if retailers can make compilations
specific to their market, they can influence the taste (as it was pre-1990).
One rule with this, though, you can't burn more than 3 tracks from the same
artist on any cd -- you have to protect the artistic design of the artist.
If I were going to the trouble of making a full album, I would want people
to listen to it in its entirety and as I intended.

Give me one example when you've tried to "discuss" anything.  Basically,
your idea of discussion must be you giving your opinion than everyone
telling you how right you are.  The problem isn't necessarily your
opinions being controversial.  You don't get that.  It's you're delivery. 
It's why no one takes them seriously.

Everyone annoys you apparently...that doesn't mean he doesn't contribute. 
You seem to annoy everyone...so by you logic, you don't contribute so you
are lame.

Hahaha.  Chris...I know you think you (and let's not forget "your boys")
being willing to back up anything with your fists.  You're always ready
for a fight apparently.  But you never seem to back up you opinions with
good/logical explainations or reasons why you have those particular
opinions.  You never back up your intelligence.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} A Catridge Thread

Cartridges are all a matter of opinon and personal preference.

One thing you should remember, when universal tonearms were invented they
did not forsee the way the modern dj uses them in their design.  Every time
you take a cartridge off and on a tonearm you are doing some damage to the
contacts, opening them up for oxidation, corrision and other debris.  The
best possible thing to do is buy cartriges for your tables and do not take
them off and on.

  Here is mine my opinion of the brands:

I can't speak of sure, because I rarely use them.  They way the are put
together as well as their oversized nature is a turn off.  I also don't like
the way you have a rough time seeing the groove... but that could be my
inexperience with them.

Groovemasters/Trackmasters are RUBBISH in every way a needle can be.  Their
contacts are oversized, and while they might make good contact, they do
quite a bit of damage to tonarms.  They have a high output, but generally
sound like crap.

Ortofons are the best, IMHO.  The nightclubs sound AMAZING compared to every
other needle.  However, the high end output on them is pointless on low end
soundsystems.  I actually think the trackmasters sound better on bad
soundsystems, on a quality system you will notice the ortofons sound much
better.

Ortofons are way overpriced.  List on them are $200.00 a piece, while MAP
price is now $164.99 a piece, though some places still have stock from
before the price increase.  That's for the concorde nightlcub spherical.

For an economical solution, I recommend ortofon OM model nightclubs.  You
get all the great sound of a nightclub stylus for $90, but you need your old
traditonal headshell.  The best part here is that the old traditional
headshells still make the best contact with the tonearm.

I also still recommend the pre-trackmaster models of Stanton.  500's are
still a workhorse, and 680's still are great and sound good.  (Those number
have changed slightly, I think).  These are more economical.

As for the difference between spherical and elliptical, well you will get
many arguments.  Ortofons sell 100 spherical to every one elliptal.
Elliptical is for studio use, they definately sound better - but they don't
like back-cueing - I think that is where they do the most damage.
Ellipticals tend to wear records a bit more than spherical.  That's what I
have determined, but you will find people who disagree.

Also, with Ortofons, they go through a "break in" period.  They don't sound
best until after several hours of use.  During the intial runs on elliptical
models I notice them gathering dust bunnies.  Dust bunnies don't happen as
frequently with spherical after the intital break in.

One final thing to keep in mind -- zero residue cleaner.  Keep a can on
hand.  When you take the cartriges off and on, clean the tonearm and the
cartrige and you will get a great connection every time as long as the
contacts have not been damaged by the nasty ass trackmasters.   Do not use
lubricated cleaner, however, that can do a little harm on the sound quality.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} A Catridge Thread

I have, and will always prefer stanton 505's for my style.  They allow me
flexibility in mixing style as well as providing a consistent quality sound.
I think it's more of a matter of finding what works best for you.  I agree
with doug though, every time i've used a trackmaster when not on my home
equip, i just didnt like them, but the orto's seem to deliver a much crisper
sound into my headphones and are actually enjoyable to work with when i'm
just beatmatching track after track... i guess you could say that i have the
505's cause they take a beating, and when i look at the ortos, all i see
myself doing is breaking them.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} P2P and the RIAA

the item in question has been around for years, it was the trading craze
before ftp's, before p2p, it will continue to be more of an internet elite
usage device because it's just not dumbed down enough for my 12 year old
cousin to hop on and download shit from.  I'm not scared for it to be taken
over by the masses, it's pretty much maintained it's presence in a stable
and solid community structure with minimal growth when compared to the
exponential growth that p2p systems exhibit.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} P2P and the RIAA

I guess that's a pretty good question. There are a couple things I can think 
of. For one, you know what you're getting as far as quality of the rips, 
etc. There are a lot of incomplete songs, poor encoding and such, to be 
found on p2p.

More importantly though, is along the lines of what Doug B. was talking 
about with respect to custom compliations. The licensing through ASCAP and 
BMI is the issue that keeps p2p from being legal. Sure, I don't give much of 
a shit, but I am not making any money off the stuff I rip from the net. I've 
seen net enabled jukeboxes in bars around here. If the song you want isn't 
available, it will be streamed off the net. Seems to me that idea could be 
adapted to service various other scenarios.

Okay, my response is pretty weak overall. I guess the major point is that 
the licensing is important only to people who are directly affected by the 
legalities of said licensing. The only cds I have bought in about a GANG of 
minutes are the ones that simply aren't available on the net, mainly because 
I know the artists and want to support what they're doing. Specifically I am 
referring to small bands like Telefonics, Viragos, Mighty Underdogs, etc.

So why would anyone use this instead of Kazaa or soulseek or Limewire or
whatever the next one is? Any time that one service is shut down,
another will just appear that will be even harder to stop. It doesn't
really matter what they do now because people are getting used to the
idea of free music, and will continue to seek it out.

I think I've bought 1 cd in the past 2 years, and don't see any reason
to buy them in the future.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kazaa


tom theres a reason most bands still goto professional studios for mixdowns 
and overdubs...its because most people that do computer based tracking arent 
using a pro-tools hd based setup...yes you can track in sonar, cubase, 
logic, neudeo, and digital performer...and yes it will sound better than a 
cassette multitrack...but if you want to put out quality albums you still 
need to take it to a real sound engineer and run your digital stuff through 
some tubes to get some warmth in it...thats where your expense comes in...a 
good engineer charges anywhere from 20-1000/hour...to mixdown and master a 
10 track album you are looking at a minium of 8 hours...what might sound 
great to you in your headphones doesnt always sound great when you put it 
over a set of good reference monitors...the only bands i can think of that 
want to sound like shit are punk bands...so unless you are in a punk band 
and you dont give a shit how you sound you need the added expense of 
professional mixing/mastering...which means you will probably need an 
investor(ie record company)to front you some money...and thats just what the 
record companies do...they front bands money to finish albums...then you 
have to tour to pay back that loan...i think the system does actually work 
pretty well...theres just alot of greedy bastards out there that are 
fronting out more money that is actually needed so they have a band or 
performer in their pocket for 5 years.

Check this link out:

http://www.etronics.com/product.asp?stk_code=ortccnightclubss

thats 150 for a pair.

Though, I just cleaned the pair of Ortofon Concorde "Blues" and they are 
sounding pretty tight right now (I got those for 120 a pair).

www.htfr.com also has pretty good prices on catridges and styli.

You mentioned damage to tonearm contacts... this worries me a little. In the 
future, am I going to have to replace a tonearm? I don't expect this to 
happen for a very long time.

Thank you VERY much - your e-mail was very helpful and informative.

Do you think you could help me with one more thing:

The correct procedure for setting the tonearm counter-weight? Every month 
someone tells me something different...

Hope you all have a great New Year!

<<The correct procedure for setting the tonearm counter-weight? Every month
someone tells me something different...>>

I'm with Paul on this one. I haven't the foggiest idea if I'm doing it
right. I've had various turntables for years, and they've all been
different. Is there a good reference on this stuff??

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} A Catridge Thread

Wow on that price.  It is almost too good to be true, I'm gonna check in on
it.  I'm an Ortofon dealer so it should be interesting to find out.  I am
not offered that paticular product.  I have a suspicion that the place I buy
Ortofon from is really just an importer of the product and that it would
better to deal directly overseas.  But then again, that's all the place
sells so who knows.

As for adjusting the counterweight, well, everyone does it different.  I'll
go into full details about all of it, the same speach I give to everyone.

A)  Make sure your turntables are level.  Buy a $1.00 level at drug mart and
make sure they are level front to back and side to side.   Unlevel
turntables means two things.  1)  possibility of not tracking properly and
jumping grooves and 2) most importantly it will wear your record enevenly.
The grooves on one channel will get worn before the grooves on the other.
Balanced turntables ensure proper contact between the stylus and the
grooves.

B)  Put your stylus on the tonearm as it would be if you are playing.
Adjust the weight on the back so that the tonearm floats back and forth.
This might be a good time to play with the anti-skate as well to see what it
really does.  While the tonearm is floating you will notice it does not stay
in any one position... it actually floats and moves easily... if it doesn't
then you need to repair your tables.   With the tonearm floating, adjust the
index wheel on the weight to read ZERO.  Then turn it to add 3.5 to 4 grams
of weight.  This is the recommended weight with Ortofon and with Stanton
500/680.  Most people will tell you to set the anti-skate to the same as
your tonearm weight... this is a might.  Ortofon says that you should not
use any tracking force, set it at zero.   Personally, while adjusting the
tonearm I sometimes adjust the anti-skate so that there is no pull one
directio or the other.  The anti-skate puts extra pressure on one channel of
the groove, so that means more wear.

Many people suggest using a one sided record to adjust your anti-skate.   I
don't think there really is any one definative method for this.  I have had
old tables that you have to use the anti-skate to get them to work.  Who
knows.


C)  Tonearm Height.   This has been a myth to me for many years and still
is.   Ortofon told me to set it to 1.5 for the concorde models.   Street
talk always said not to elevate them, only scratch djs do that.   So I set
em to 1.5 every time.   I think the goal is to keep the stylus level with
the record and not tilt to it.


After you have cleaned your tonearm with proper cleaner, you will know if
you need to replace the tonearm  If you leave your cartriges on and don't
change them frequently there should be no problem.... even if you did use
crapmasters.  It is the constant on/off that causes the problems.

I have seen tonearms that require rigorous cleaning as well.  While it is
common knowlege that licking your needles is a temporary solution, it only
really adds buildup inside the tonearm.

Oh, and with HTFR... they may have good prices but what about the shipping?
That's another place that really bothers me because too many people buy
their entire set list from HTFR and don't play new music.  Gotta have people
playing new stuff because otherwise the scene gets stuck.

I'd like to thank you, Kerem, and Kaleo too, for providing a great place to
relax, and listen to the best pittsburgh has to offer.

I don't know how you continue to do it, especially in light of the lack of
success Adam and Jwan had in the same spot, with the same quality, one night
later....

I look back at my ability to premiere my new original tracks at your place
as one of the highlights of 2002.

Keep me in mind for 2003....I'm cooking up some more goodness.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} A Catridge Thread

Rad.

Everyone I have spoken to has told me to set the anti-skating on the tech 
12's to the max (which is 3, I believe). Ortofon suggests 1.5?

I try to stick with the overseas ordering when I just can't find the record 
I want anywhere domestically. I have only ordered from HTFR once, and it 
took about 10 days (give or take) for the record to get to my door...not to 
mention shipping charges.

I have never ordered equipment from them.

That other site, etronics, seems to be very reasonable.

Take their prices to Prosound, abuse their low price guarantee (beats it by 
10%) and boom... thats like what... 135 bucks for a pair of Nightclubs from 
PSSL. =)

I'm thinking about just getting some nightclubs and using my used blues as 
backups.

...or I might just spend the 135 dollars on more records.

Keep pimping it with the info Doug!

Greetings to everyone!  I have once again rejoined this list. For those =
of you who even noticed I left. I just cannot keep myself from the =
ranting and raving of you people. Probably more ranting then actual =
raving, but what the hell. =20
Since I am a loser and can find nothing that looks worthwhile for =
tonight, I have decided to just do my own thing.  I am going to be =
having a small get together tonight at my downtown Cleveland apartment, =
in celebration of NYE, as well as my girlfriend Cathy's b-day.  It's not =
going to be anything special really. I just want to chill with some cool =
people instead of going to a bar.  This will be a BYOB party with open =
tables, so bring your records.  I live in the wharehouse district, so if =
you decide your bored, you can alwasy just walk downstairs and go to one =
of the trance bars.  The only catch is that parking will probably be =
limited, and you may have to find a parking lot and pay. I suggest =
coming early. Party will go on from 8pm - ??.  If you have nothing =
better to do, your more then welcome to come.  NO SHADY FUCKS ALLOWED.  =
If interested, e-mail me, or call me at 216-781-0764 for directions.

Peace

No Revolve Bunch, thank you!

I haven't had a chance to go out on Mondays much in the last year but 
recently have thoroughly enjoyed the music, the people, and that atmosphere 
of Zythos on Monday nights.

Besides the White Chocolate Martini = YUM! (even when the poor bartender is 
giving you that annoyed "I can't believe I have to make you another martini" 
face).

Often times I have to crate up my tables.  Traditionally, I have always
taken off the cartridges to prevent them from getting munged up in transit
and store them in their cases.  Would it be better to instead leave them in
while crated?

I've been in the habit of taking my needles off after every use.  I guess it
would be prudent to discontinue this practice.  I'm just too worried of them
getting fucked up, mostly from stupid people that lumber about when I'm away
from the tables.

Thanks for the good advice.  What a useful and informative thread.

That thing is so chock full of total bullshit, disinformation it would 
almost be laughable except for the implications of misleading *normal* 
people.

It makes me think of the DEA conference from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, 
where the director is just spewing out absolute rubbish.

Is this supposed to be real or is it thinly veiled satire? If it IS in fact 
real, the taxpayers are sure getting ripped off by paying this *expert* Mr. 
Farley's salary.

Great post.  I would like to add that every time you or another dj licks the
contacts of the cartridge you are oxidizing the tonearm and cartridge.  I
swear this is a major problem with most of the tables out there.  To get rid
of oxidation you can use a normal pencil eraser.

I use the nightclub OM elliptical.  I only back cue on the first beat since
I don't scratch so I haven't really noticed any damage.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} A Catridge Thread

I was to the understanding that Ortofons (along with many other DJ specific
elliptical needles) used the "floating" needle technology....

For instance, if you're looking at the needle from the side (from the
spindle out, so to speak)...

When the record is playing it looks like this:    \

When you back-cue, the needle "floats" to another position, and looks like
this:    /

Is this not the case?? Am I just whacked?? (Well, moreso than usual, anyway)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} A Catridge Thread

I haven't really noticed that, although I don't pay much attention to things
like that.  My basic understanding about elliptical heads are that they look
like this:
0
instead of:
o

This gives them more surface contact with the record and supposedly a better
sound.

Another thing to think about is stylus replacement.  Most people wait until
they can't cue with a stylus before replacement.  The real reason you
replace the stylus is because over time the freq. range becomes smaller
because of needle wear.  If the needle starts out at 20hz to 20k hz then it
could begin to squeeze out the lower and upper freq. if it isn't replaced
properly.  I learned this while reading about final scratch.  The timecode
data wouldn't be sent to the computer properly because the older needles
wouldn't be transmitting all of the signal and it was confusing the
software.

just thought i'd jump in at all the gear talk and show off my new toy.  I
just got a tube composer (third rack down in picture).  Its a tube hybrid
compressor and sounds quite tight.  I've been constantly changing my gear
that i own and use developing a perfect little working studio for my self to
do recording.  Its mostly software based production ( see rack mountable
system under monitor ) these days yet i deffinately integrate physical
hardware to give everything a real sound.  I do have lots invested yet its
all earned from hard work at a real job.  I just wanted to throw in that its
not impossible that artists can do alot them selves with out backing.  I'd
hate to hand my shit over to an engineer because then they are kind of doing
the work if you know what i mean.  I might give something to simmon in the
UK to engineer someday though, hear hes the dogs danglies.

NO, the anti skate is set preferably to 0 or wherever the needle easily
follows the groove.  Or whatever your preference.

The tonearm height is set to 1.5 recommended by ortofon or so that the
needle is level to the vinyl.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Something tonight

I first thought I was going to go out but I figured i should save as 
much money as I can until i get a job.  So unless something comes up, 
i'll probably be spending tonight playing games online.  So if you 
see a player named "Otagi" (mainly playing UT2003) that's me.

anything special really. I just want to chill with some cool people instead of going to a bar.  This will be a BYOB party with open tables, so bring your records.  I live in the wharehouse district, so if you decide your bored, you can alwasy just walk downstairs and go to one of the trance bars. 
 The only catch is that parking will probably be limited, and you may have to find a parking lot and pay. I suggest coming early. Party will go on from 8pm - ??.  If you have nothing better to do, your more then welcome to come.  NO SHADY FUCKS ALLOWED.  If interested, e-mail me, or call me at 
216-781-0764 for directions.

shures really do have the best bass response of anything on the
market...last friday we had to tweak out the eq all over again when john put
his m44-7s on(we had the eq setup with shawns niteclubs)...hopefully those
whitelables have nearly the same bass response...they definately have a 22nd
century look to them though :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} P2P and the RIAA

usenet is losing its ground these days.  the reason is simple.  back in
the day, every isp ran its own news servers and accepted full news feeds
from their peers.  full news feeds meaning that ALL of usenet was stored
on the server(s).  the amount of resources required to keep these
servers running grew exponentially and isp's began dropping binaries
groups or trimming their retention times to only a few days.  these
days, most isp's outsource their news to large dedicated providers like
supernews (critical path) who do nothing but maintain huge server farms
dedicated to usenet only.  control of usenet will eventually centralize
and get run over by the goons like everything else.  don't get me wrong,
its great for finding some seriously crazy conversation (if you can
fight thru the spam), but the days of binaries on usenet are numbered.

Cheers to all!  Hope everyone is having (had) a safe and happy New Years.  I don't know if anyone was out at Peabody's, but it was a damn good time!  Enjoy the New Year!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} A Catridge Thread





Well, different needles have different suspension systems.  The suspension 
helps the needle stay in the groove and have good sound.  A stiffer 
suspension helps a lot with scratching, and the stiffer suspension needles 
don't sway back and forth as much when you change directions.  Shure M44-7's 
have a really tight suspension, for instance.. I know my trackmasters have a 
prety loose suspension.  Plus they suck.

Oh, and people asked about height adjustment.  It's usually not a big issue 
unless you put some thick slipmats on your tables or something.  What you're 
supposed to do to adjust it properly is put a record on the platter and put 
the needle on it.  Get your eyes on the same level as the needle, and look 
at it from the side.  The flat part of the cartridge at the tip, right where 
the needle is, should be parallel with the surface of the record.

Don't know if that makes sense.. it's easier to draw. :)

Happy new year's everybody!

-Dave
