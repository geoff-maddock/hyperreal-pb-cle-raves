Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: midi ring tones

	You probably need a sequencing program to write midi. Im getting Logic 
Audio platinum very soon, but I know the MOTU Digital Performer is a 
major player. As soon as you have the prog its simple from their on 
out, since you prob will NOT be hooking up some sort of Sound Module (a 
synth) to it and dont need any sort of interface. I personally dont 
know any other kind of programs that write midi, but...i think when i 
was learning Pascal last year, you could write it.
	 Eh, anyways, your better off going to some European site version of 
your phone. Europe is WAY ahead of us when it comes to cell phones. Go 
download Zombie Nation -Kernkraft 400 or something else...im sure 
theres a ton of sites if u look.
Later,
Alex tweak

bjork is probably the only "pop" act I can tolerate.  Her new cd?  It's
different.  But in this day and age thats damn good.  She can afford to
explore as a artist sometimes she hits, it some times she doesn't.  I am
interested to see where she goes.

Good point alex.  My favorite mix of all time is Dave Trance - late night
live.  I have lost it long ago and would pay for another copy.

50/50? how the hell is that? theres no weak tracks on that LP.

>what i didnt like about true colors was there wasnt one track 
with 
>dirty bass...shit was too clean...i like a bit of distortion

weak. there's plenty of nice smooth disco bass on that LP, i cant 
imagine what you would need aside from that. 

>someother dnb classics i dig(in no particular order)
>
>tourque - no u turn(va)

this is still kinda dope, but it definitely hasnt aged as well as 
platinum breakz, logical progression 1, or even the prototype 
years. 

>sound in motion and molten beats - ram

sound in motion maybe, molten beats youve gotta be kidding. that 
LP was crap. i think i played one track from it once. 

>the creeps and wormhole - ed and optical

wormhole maybe, the creeps was atrocious. i couldnt even listen to 
that fucker. 

>diagnostics - tech itch

that had some jams but was mainly filler. if it wasnt for "reborn" 
i probably wouldnt have bought it since i had a single with the 
other dope tracks from it. 

>panacea's first lp(i forget the name,ill look at the cd when i 
get home)

you mean low profile darkness? it was good....

>inside the machine - bad company

you MUST be smoking crack. 

>killa bites (vinyl packs, not the mix cds)

the vinyl packs were so frustrating. theyd put one or two dope 
tracks on a triple pack and youd have to pay for filler material 
by shere khan to get the terrorist remix. what a fucking ripoff. 

>dubzilla - digital (i know its new...but its probably the best lp 
this year 
>imho)

i only listened to some of the tracks from there, but they werent 
the bomb. what about calibre's LP? that shit was white hot. 

>well i know im going to get torn apart on a coupla those...but 
they are 
>records i still listen to and even drop in mixes...

anyway, here's some actually dope drum and bass comps:
drumfunk hooligans 1 + 2
audio blueprint's "Voyager" lp. now THATS some dope dark shit, 
lots of dark funk and minimalism. 

and as for artist albums, omni trio's LPs were all good. you still 
havent been listening to this shit long enough ace, your tastes 
are all too biased towards recent crap.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best mix cd/tape was Electronic Album Ever

	Hmm, I cant say the best, but definately the one that influenced me 
the most, or at least stayed inside my CD player the longest is :
Ferry Corsten live at Innercity 99
	Granted, this is acctually a badly mixed set, and I can easily pick 
out 2 mixes between songs that were post edited (you can tell cuz it 
switches from stereo to mono, or vice versa JUST before the mix 
starts...tha fucking dope). Anyways, at the time I was heavy into that 
(cheez) Trance, and I loved (and still do) several of the tracks in his 
mix. Thats acctually prob the reason i even liked it so much? Allthough 
this is a real cd, i did burn meeself a copy. Anyways, I was really 
into making my own cds of live sets that I split with cue points. Beats 
having to pay for your cds :-p.
	Ironically if I had to pick a second faveorite cd, it'd be Marco V 
live at Innnercity 2000. A mix between banging techno and the trance I 
was slowly creeping away from, with some very good tunes (a few 
produced by Marco V himself). THAT cd is THE WORST cd i ever heard 
mixed live. I dunno wtf happened, but this guy isnt that bad; must have 
been some equipment problems (cuz you can COUNT the trainwrecks). And 
boy, can you believe, ID & T fucking released this as a CD they sold 
FOR MONEY? Download this set sometime if you want to laugh your ass off.

I think it just comes down to personal opinion there.
I definitely prefer Torque over both Platinum and LP 1.
It just seemed so much more raw at the time of it's release,
almost a defining point for where shit went for a few years...
(and seeing them [Ed Rush, Nico, and Trace] at IT shortly
after for the CD tour....dayum!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best mix cd/tape was Electronic Album Ever

Some self critique I wanted to add on:
	So i just realized that my liking these 2 cds, i am biasing (half) of 
the whole point of a mix CD, which is the technique, ability, 
creativity, etc, that the DJ uses. As trance djs use very little as it 
is, UNLESS of course they start their mixes at certain phrases of the 
songs theyre using (which shows they know their music), which we all 
know happens about 2.3% of the time. Therefore you can assume I am 
easily swayed by a good track selection, over how its put together, any 
day. Of course that doesnt mean I like trainwrecks! ; -)
	Well enough blabbing. And to quote the Wizard of Oz (almost); "I'm off 
to see the Magistrate!- the magistrate of (juvenile) traffic court 
......ThatsProbablyGonnaSuspendMyLiscenseForAnotherThreeMoreMonths!"

wish me luck,

***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best mix cd/tape was Electronic Album Ever

my favorite mix cd is one that salty jen hooked me up with

Afterhours - Rollin through the night...  so cheesy, so hard house you can
picture the whistle posse

but for serious...

Daft Punk - Alive 1997 is not really a mix cd or an electronic album, but a
live recording of them flowing from one of their songs to the next.  It's
badass.

and

Dionysus - The mix tape that he sent out about 2 years ago that was one side
hard techno and the other side had his alter ego doing the ambient dnb
tip... the hard techno side is boss.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: midi ring tones

get any sequencing program, they usually can save as a midi file.
or look around the net for .mid files.  there are archives of them.
though i don't know what sort of file the phone would be looking for?
single track, multitrack...?

Aroung late last year, Mtv kinda did a 
'where the hell is she' thing on Christina
(we're on a first name basis, y'know)...
and they sort of played snippets of 3 songs.

I was duly impressed with them.  I remember
thinking "man, this is what pop music should
sound like".... not QUITE as over-processed
as the OTHERS like Brittney and her ilk...

And, you CANNOT beat that girl's voice!!!

Period. End. Dot.

She sings better than Faith Evans, Mary J. Blige,
Alicia Keys, and countless others.  The ONLY person
out there now that beats her voice-wise is the one
and only Angie Stone.... that woman can BELT IT!!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} I feel ashamed to say this. but...


christinia is an incredible singer, she has mad talent......but her image is 
just very reminescent of a young mariah carey, she is doomed the same fate 
unless she really has what it takes......when she was in the lady marmalade 
video i thought she looked like a total diva, with that poofy yellow white 
with pink streaked afro like hairstyle on top of that amazing outfit and 
make up and her jeweled eybrows were inspiring.....i thought of jennifer 
star when i saw her in that video, then she wore the same hair style to the 
mtv music awards and got thrashed by the style police, fuck that.....i saw a 
picture of her recently after the awards show and she had these silicon blue 
and pink dreads in her hair and it looked pretty fuckin tyte, i definitly 
think shes got balls and easily what it takes vocally, but how's she gonna 
pan out when it comes to the turmoils of teen pop icon stardom and the the 
reputation that proceeds her??? IMO, she has yet to prove herself as a pop 
princess/diva. It just reminds me a lot of mariah. As for britney, I put my 
bets on her career path leading to playboy centerfold, and probably sooner 
than not.

but thats my point. it still sounds just like 1996, but those

even within that genre of music much better tunes have been made 
since then.

i guess your personal taste just sucks, is short sighted and 
biased towards recent boring records. techstep should have died 
sometime in 98 at the latest, but the same sounds and beats have 
been being hammered for the 4 years since then. how anyone can 
listen to another tech step track without shooting vomit out their 
nose is beyond me. whats so wrong with heavy metal that all you 
drum and bass people dont just go listen to it instead? or maybe 
go buy some drumcode records. leave the breakbeats alone.

Well they are saved in a .kws format. That isn't a normal midi file.
But I'm able to import ringers by way of my computer and a data cable.

get any sequencing program, they usually can save as a midi file.
or look around the net for .mid files.  there are archives of them.
though i don't know what sort of file the phone would be looking for?
single track, multitrack...?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} I feel ashamed to say this. but...

Actually, I just now got back from hanging out with someone who spent all 
day yesterday with Christina (she was here in Pgh on the southside doing a 
photo shoot) and this person said her wardrobe consisted of some pretty cool 
stuff but her image was still 'show as much skin as possible' - bikinis, 
daisy duke short-shorts and even some dominatrix get-up.

we'll have to ask DJ Centauri, he personally DJed for her all day during the 
photo shoot.

you can listen to the discoey stuff as a chill factor of music.  it's easing

doesnt have to coincide with being angry.

Torque is on No U-turn from 97, has stuff by Nico, Trace, Ed Rush, Fierce,
etc on it.  Platinum Breakz 1 is on Metalheadz and is a compilation with a
1 or 2 exclusive tracks, and has stuff by Dillinja, Lemon D, Ed Rush,
Optical, etc.  LP 1 I dunno what he's talking about, I wasn't following
this that closely.

Examples of housey discoy dnb - stuff by Greg Packer ("change of heart"
"weheres the disco" etc), peshay ("satisfy my love", "you got me burnin").
High contrast ("passion", "whats the story" are some examples).  Alot of
this stuff you will find on labels such as hospital and defunked, they
have been putting out this sound in newer releases.

If you want to go into it, Torque wasnt as groundbreaking as "Tech
steppin", the 96 emotif comp that "coined the term".  With tracks on it by
doc scott, trace, etc.

V/A (Ed Rush, Nico, Trace & Others) - Torque LP - No-U-Turn Recordings
V/A (Ed Rush, Optical, Adam F, Dillinja & Others) - Platinum Breakz 1 LP- Metalheadz Recordings

two Lp's that defined the techstep sound. Nobody really understands the term techstep (I hear this term thrown around way to loosely) so I will attempt to define it.

Techstep - minimal, stripped down, very metallic and harsh & dark sounding drum & bass, popular from late 95 through late 97.  Beats were stripped down from sampled drum breaks to simple two step patterns with kicks and snares.  Contrary to poular belief, techstep died in late 97.  Referring to anything after late 97 as techstep is WRONG.   Ed Rush & Opticals Wormhole LP killed techstep.  This album featured actual drum breaks (not just two step drum patterns) and warm, rolling basslines. Popular techstep D&B labels - Trouble on Vinyl, Renegade Hardware, No-U-Turn, Moving Shadow, 31 Records, Saigon, early Virus, early Metro, Nu Black, and some Metalheadz.

Best Examples:

Shadowboxing - Nasty Habits - 31 recs
Quadrant 6 - Dom & Optical - Moving Shadow
 

Housey Drum & Bass:

poularized by J Majik (Infrared & Defected Recoprdings) with Love is Not a Game, Soloraize, Spaced Invaders, 24 Hours, Monster, & New Generation

other examples:

Sonic - Evan When It Rains (Super Disco Mix) - Infrared
Music is Everything - High Contrast - Hospital
Back for More - Influx Datum - Formation
People All Around - Tommy Knocker - Intercom
All for Love - Tommy Knocker - Intercom
Stand Up - Tommy Knocker - Intercom

What's up yall.. well tonight we have a special treat in store for you.
Ishkabibl has been DJing longer than most people I know, and his selection
is always fresh, interesting, and full of great tunes.  Some of you may
remember his memorable performances from FESP's Metropolis (99, skibo
gymnasium), FESP's Land of The Lost (2000, laga), or perhaps you mave have
heard him play @ 1814.  I think of him as "one of Pittsburgh's best kept
secrets."  Warming it up is Vinny, whose cd "Love" really made the rounds
in my car.  I am as excited to hear him as he is to play.  You may have
heard him at Pub IG's all star game night, or at Havana, or any other
night that features deep, soulful house.  Please come out and show your
support!  I will be playing some soulful, funky and atmospheric dnb from
10-11.

im thinking you dont know what it is. sure there are some dark 
jams on platinum breakz 1, but i would NEVER call it anything 
resembling techstep. 

>Techstep - minimal, stripped down, very metallic and harsh & dark 
sounding drum & bass, popular from late 95 through late 97. 

youre insane. 

>Beats were stripped down from sampled drum breaks to simple two 
step patterns with kicks and snares.  Contrary to poular belief,

techstep is WRONG.   Ed Rush & Opticals Wormhole LP killed 
techstep.  This album featured actual drum breaks (not just two

how are the wormhole or any breaks since then more "complex" than 
the "simple" tech step beat?

also, i must add that you reference "shadowboxing" which utilized 
sampled amens for each and every beat. anyway, just about no drum 
and bass since 95 or so used straight sampled drum loops. just 
about anything since then, from aphrodite to bad company to doc 
scott to your mama just samples and edits drum breaks.

youre a joker. shit like that was coming out wayyyyyyy before j 
majik used kathy brown on a track. shit, check alot of the earlier 
GLR shit, even that has housey overtones.

i dont know, im still pretty angry all the time, but i rarely 
listen to angry music anymore. its just too over the top in 
general. even if youre insanely angry, there are much better ways 
to express it than beating people over the head with harsh music. 
reguardless, youre point is still right on.....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} I feel ashamed to say this. but...

pretty much how I feel about the christina/britney quaral.  Christina 
has the better voice, but I think britney looks hotter.  So it's not 
hard to see that christina could possibly be a big singer, whereas 
britney will be on the cover of playboy sometime soon.  I don't think 
christina has really gotten a reputation as much as britney has (who 
hasn't heard about her boobs being fake or not?)

I guess I'll give my two cents on actresses with great voices.  Off 
the top of my head (I know I'll miss some) I can think of Charlett 
Church (that 14 (i think) year old opera singer), christina, 
destiny's child, Dixie Chicks (about the only contry group I like), 
Madonna (don't care about the protools comment, not all of her stuff 
uses that), Sara McLoughlin (just listen to delerium - silence), 
Dune, and I'm sure there are others that I can't think of...

yo, has anyone heard that new madonna joint? shit is hot. i think 
the guy on the radio said its from the upcoming james bond flick. 

as far as britney-christina goes, i hate em both. christina can 
sing, which makes her more useful i suppose. but i think neither 
of them looks very good.

Subject: {pb-cle} platinum breaks 1, Torque, Tech Steppin'


from my collection :)

Platinum Breakz 1 - (Metalheadz, 96)
Doc Scott - The Unofficial Ghost
J. Majik - Final Approach
J. Majik - Your Sound
Photek - Consciousness
Hidden Agenda - The Flute Tune
Lemon D - In My Life
Wax Doctor - The Spectrum
Alex Reece - Pulp Fiction
Peshay - The Notcturnal (back on the firm)
Source Direct - A Made Up Sound
Dillinja - Armoured D
Digital - Down Under

Now whether these are "tech step" or not, I'm not even gonna get into that
debate.

Torque - (No U-Turn, 97)
Ed Rush + Nico - Proton
Ed Rush + Nico - Torque
Trace + Nico - Damn Son
Nico - Lo
Fierce + Nico - Crystal
Ed Rush + Nico - Defect
Trace + Nico - Squadron
Ed Rush, Trace, Nico - Droid

Hmm you think Nico did any engineering on this?? hahaha :)

And finally the album that "coined the term"
Techsteppin - A journey into experimental drum n bass (Emotif, 1996)

Skyscraper (Nico + trace) - Liberty 1
Ed Rush - check me out
the Limit (Grooverider) - Get Stoned
Cronic Crew - Black Marbles
Doc Scott - Machines
Hydro - The Zone
Skyscraper (Nico + trace) - Mach II
elementz of noise - Headless horsemen (steppin on headz mix)


So if you claim to know about tech step, but havent heard techsteppin, go
check it out, cuz thats where the term comes from.

For anyone thinking about getting a (new) cell phone and/or
service that doesn't care too much about having lots of voice
minutes, but cares about e-mail, AIM, and browsing the web, check
out the new t-mobile sidekick (aka danger hiptop).

It's the hot shit and even though it's being released today, I can
almost guarantee it will blow the fuck up within the next year (in
a good way.... not like "kaboom").

real quickly it's got:
200 anytime minutes, 1000 weekend minutes, 12-voice polyphonic
ring tones, QWERTY keyboard entry, a cool ass swivel display, and
unlimited data usage for the following:
AOL AIM; web browsing (better than other cell phone
browsers/wireless pdas; access to 4 e-mail accounts (1 t-mobile
account and 3 pop accounts); always-on connectivity... etc

i can't wait to get my hands on one (going to get one activated

i did not say "simple" or "complex" as a competition

techstep breaks are stripped down to simple patterns no frills - you know -no fills, rolls, layered breaks or high hats. - kick,snare,kick,snare

so what is your point??? this has nothing to do with this argument. dillinja drums his own beats then samples and edits them, as do many other producers. who cares if they are sampled, edited, or played live. the description is about the drum sound in reference to the techstep sound.

Techstep = Techno plus Jungle

Techstep didn't "die" in 97, it's still what 99.9% of DNB is, because it's all structured exactly like Techno.  The idea of a cut and paste, always changing tune (which is what 
made hardcore (and later, jungle) so successful from 91-95) was completely lost when Ed Rush and Nico started thinking they were Juan Atkins and making this "progressive, 
slow changing" DNB, which in essence, took out all the ideas of the original sound, and made jungle simply sound like Techno on the wrong speed......which it still does 
(unless you know where to look).  Call it "progression". "innovation", or whatever other marketing term the UK DNB Boy's Club has taught you in order to buy more records, but 
it's just simply bad.

There was once a time when jungle was shocking.  Now it's just background music at a rave, like trance, or house.

tom doesn't understand personal taste.

he cant understand why i don't like music with "soul" or a funky feel to
it.

in fact he can't believe that anyone would ever listen to anything that he
doesn't listen to!

there's a simple reason for that: im not biased against any good 
music in any genre. 

and if you think that music is subjective, youre insane. are 
morals subjective? because some arabs think that bombing jews is 
morally proper does that mean that it really is just because they 
think so? are n'sync the best artists of all time because they 
sold more records in one week than anyone ever did? music is 
objective. it just takes plenty of time and experience listening 
to it to be able to easily weed out the bad and keep the good.

Just cause someone is a candy raver doesn't necessarily make them a moron.
Entropy knows his shit when it comes to music.  Can't say I agree with him
about everything, but a lot of that is personal taste.

How long have you been listening to dnb?  Because I bet Entropy has you
beat.

Jesus...some people don't have a clue.

tell me why i should plunk down 25 of my hard earned dollars to hear music i 
dont like all nite?  if we had decent raves or club nites around here with 
headliners i want to see you will see me there...when jungle lounge was 
running at spy bar i would be up there when ever i could afford it...case in 
point...in april i went to dayton to hear bailey...in may i went to detroit 
to hear krust...in june i went to pitts to hear andy and shimon...granted 
pitts has some nice club nites...but i work 230-11 and theres no possible 
way that i can make it down there to kick it..

none of those sites are nearly as comprehensive as doa's dubplate 
fourm...there are 400 odd dubs on doa...maybe 50 on urban future...half of 
them are from ak1200...and pardon me for not bothering producers on aim when 
they could be spending time working...if i need to say something ill leave 
them an email or a pm and they can reply to me at their leisure...

dont be salty with everyone thats on doa or uses it just cuz everyone over 
there knows your a chacho...i personally havent posted anything over there 
in close to 8 months now...but none of us forgot when fresh almost sued your 
ass for that god awful nine rmx you put up


deal with the matter

yeah... that track caught my ear right away... I never, ever listen to the
radio but I was in my mom's car and it came on and I liked it instantly. The
drum track, the quirky little pauses... awesome strings... it is so fucking
great, can't wait to hear remixes. What is it called???

Subject: {pb-cle} Christina & What's-her-face

{{ Soniq Stylz <djsoniqstylz@hotmail.com> }
I'm actually diggin that new Christina Aguilara song w/ Redman. I heard that
shit on a mix show last week, and when I found out who it was I about
shit. }}

Yes, this song is the bullet. I don't know why people diss on Chrintina -
she's a great singer. And Redman, well, he's fucking golden. I was looking
for this song about two months ago and it was nowhere to be found. Now most
"pop" radio stations are playing it.

-

{{ Todd (aka VR) <vr@vrillusions.com> }
Christina has the better voice, but I think britney looks hotter. }}

I think Christina is hotter AND has the better voice. I wasn't into the
whole weird Moulin Rouge look but that's okay. This is where it's at:

http://connection.christina-aguilera.net/photos/pages/shoot.html
http://connection.christina-aguilera.net/photos/pages/mtvflipalicia.html

Go Stillers.

I will say this, however - Britney is working with MUCH better production
talents, and that's why her songs are hotter, but if she wasn't working with
N.E.R.D. she'd pretty much be worthless.

http://connection.christina-aguilera.net/photos/vma00_06.jpg

Right. I'm glad somebody thinks it's funny.

-

{{ Todd (aka VR) <vr@vrillusions.com> }
So it's not hard to see that christina could possibly be a big singer,
whereas britney will be on the cover of playboy sometime soon. }}

Well, I hear that Britney has been hanging out with Jenna Jameson lately.
You fine gentlemen know what inevitably happens next, but it's not Playboy.
Jenna will change her fucking world... sometimes I wish she'd come change
mine.

-

{{ Soniq Stylz <djsoniqstylz@hotmail.com> }
Sean Paul's "Gimme The Light" is also growin on me, too. }}

Oh, absolument! That one's way hot. Not as hot at Xzibit's "Multiply,"
though - THAT one is the TORCH.

-

Don't fucking ask me how this is rave related.

frost, brian gee, and aphrodite.....but really the major dnb producers are 
all over in the uk, playing out frequently, I've forwarded a few line ups 
from the dnb arena mailing list to pb-cle, there are major dnb djs spinning 
the same nite at weekly clubs in london.....but I don't feel like they've 
got a stronger scene over there then we do here...any of our local dnb dj's 
can spin out the freshest dnb tracks and they do, I think what we lack are 
producers and a professional communtiy effort/attempt at advancing our dnb 
scene.....I would like to see a group of dnb deejays and  promoters hook up 
and start a record label..... dj's are mixing the works of other artists...I 
dont mean to devalue any dnb spinners either, not at all, but I think we 
could take dnb to another level with all of the knowledge and experience I 
percive quite a few people round here to behold...well, I dont know, I dont 
mean this to be offensive in any way but instead of a good party consisting 
of a dj with dope mixing skills and a tyte track selection I want to see a 
community, working together and prospering, applying themselves to 
generating an amazing production of dnb, and taking it to another level ....

Subject: {pb-cle} help w/ a paper??

I have two papers for my Nonfiction class that I think some people on here could probably be of help.  The first is a profile.  Sort of like anything you'd see in a magazine.  Starting w/ history, building on a major event (in the past or present) that i can describe and then relate to how it's effected the person.  I think a traumatic event would work best, but anything exciting would do.
The second one is much more important though.  It's called an immersion piece and I observe a person or group of people unobtrustively for a while and get to know how the people interact and the ropes of things.  It's going to be written sort of like a Day in the life of...  or maybe how to throw a party successfully, or even unsuccessfully?  or possibly just explaining what it's like to be a (rave promoter?  party kid?  a drug dealer would be cool, anything else that sounds good)
I have a lot of ideas, but very few people who would fit in as a subject.  so if anyone thinks they're interesting and has a story to tell and would be willing to let me follow them around and do an interview drop me aline.  it's for the sake of higher education :o)

That's not my problem.  Maybe you need to prioritize.  Just a guess.

on this note, does anyone else think it's odd that a german phone company
(in fact, -the- german phone company) is expanding service into the u.s.?  i
mean, i'm not trying to nit pick conspiracy theories, i'm just surprised
that they have the funds.  actually, never mind .. i forget they bought
voicestream.  it makes sense now.  :P

thats exactly what i did...my priorities are working for a living so i can 
afford my car payment, my insurance payment, my vinyl habit, and my hardware

dollars for sub par parties?  oh i get it...you want me to finance half 
assed promoters that book you...im really getting sick and tired of certain 
djs on the rave circuit complaining about ppl bitching about parties...ppl 
are bitching for a reason...they expect their money's worth...they dont 
expect 1 light and crappy sound if they paid 25 dollars to get in...they 
dont expect to hear the same 40 tunes they heard at the last rave they went 
too...

you'd be surprised...but then again you probably only talk to your 16 year 
old groupies over aim...i never said doa was a godsend to dnb...i just said 
its a good tool...and of the tools out there its one of the best alongside 
the arena...and like i said i dont even post there...i just listen to dubs 
and read production tips

So you obviously don't hold being in contact with producers and DJs as a high priority.  That's fine with me, I simply have different priorities.  And that's ok!  People are 
different!

Yeah, ok.  I guess Dylan, Photek, Brisk, Odi, Dylan Drazen, and DNA are my "16 year old groupies", I'll let them know that, HAHAHAHA.

Fine.  Yes, I agree its a decent site for somethings, and I enjoy it occassionally, but it's certainly not representative of all of jungle/dnb.  It's just Bad Company's messageboard, 
woop-di-doo.

Subject: Re: RE: {pb-cle} Re: OO, oo, a history of "jungle" lesson!

my first jungle record was
dread004
tracks were
subject 13 - screaming strings
subject 13 - blu sky

that record met an unfourtunete end via the sun and my sisters stupidity(it
makes me angry every time i think about it)

i bought it after hearing screaming strings on an ancient nookie mix
tape(before i even thought of spinning)...the only reason i knew the name of
the track is cuz of stevie hyper d(rip) "make some noise for the screaming
strings"...came in a plain white cardboard sleave...dont know if there was
cover art for it or not...i think it cost about 2gbp plus postage...no
online record shops back then...got the number to blackmarket offa
irc...talked to nicky himself and arranged to wire them the money

to make a long story short i started collecting dnb and edm records in
general(there are a few deep house records and techno records in my
collection)around 96...started spinning around 99...

so what was your first jungle record....woman that rolls, oh wait probalby
man o steel, or was it some other god awful jump up rmx that all you
happycore dj's think is gold

Subject: {pb-cle} it could be done



yes, we could start producing new drum and bass tracks....we have a strong 
background in hip hop, well lets find a way to incorporate it, let's put 
together our knowledge, tastes and ideas, our equipmenmt and our time, and 
invest in something that is going to work. We can keep it underground 
enough, we dont have to constantly try to exploit what little and mimnimal 
product we have.....this could be done....maybe if you guys quit arguing 
over stupid shit like headliners and party prices and all that other crap, 
you could put some thoughts into some IDEAS of how to start our own 
productions. The people will support us if we get professional and give them 
something new and exciting,...anyone can order ram records vinyl, timeless, 
virus,  metalheadz, tech itch recordings, and play them out....but it's not 
gonna bring in the support unless they're being spun by some big fuckin 
headliner like dieselboy or ak 1200 or of course those wonderful brits that 
spin their very own shit. We have got to bring it and bring it with new 
style, drop some crazy bombs, bring in some NNNNNEEEEEWWWW shit.....there 
are so many possibilities but no one wants to put forth real effort....you'd 
rather just bitch about the same shit and why it sucks.....well why dont we 
create something we can call our own....some` new shit.....WHY DO PEOPLE 
CONTINUALLY OVERLOOK THIS TO KEEP ON TRYING TO BRING IN THE SUPPORT, BUT 
THEY'RE ALL SPINNING AT HOUSEPARTIESAND SHIT. EVERYONE IS TRYING TO GET OUT 
THE SOUNDS AND MAKE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES, BUT WE NEED TO GET 
PRODUCERS...LETS TRRY TO THINK OF WHAT WE COULD NOO....SOMEONE MUST BE ABLE 
TO THINK OF SOMETHING HERE...

the music was some of the best i've ever had at any of my events.  pr0teus 
rocked, and penta performed one of the best live sets i have ever seen.  too 
bad more people didn't show up.  those who missed it missed something very 
special.  i'm done throwing events in pittsburgh for a loooong time, if ever 
again.

Nope, my first jungle record was the FIRST jungle record:  "Original Nuttah" by Shy FX.  My first rave record I ever bought was some obscure 92/93 Hardcore tune that no 
one knows the name of (I tried to get an ID, but NO ONE knew it).  After Original Nuttah, I picked up "Junglist" by Congo Natty (Congo Natty 001), "Grown In The Jungle" 
from 1994, and some ragga bits (Shabba Ranks white labels, etc, etc) from 94 or so.  This was all around 94/95 when I started buying tunes (I didn't get TWO techs til March 
of 96).

I started with Ragga and Hardstep, and picked up Jump-Up when it started as a backlash to the "Stupid-step" that Ed Rush and Nico were doing in 96.  Then I progressed 
onto Happy Hardcore, Disco House, 2-Step Garage, Techno/Electro, and finally to Old Skool Hardcore and New Old Skool Hardcore, but I've bought jungle records the 
whole time (well, maybe not so many in 1998, cause that was the worst year for music ever), and I follow it the closest I follow anything.  I still play just as much "dnb" as I do 
other things in my sets.  It's all Hardcore, mate!

aphrodite and jump up have more to do with jungle than the tech 
step shit you listen to. i bet you think hardcore is cheesy. go 
get a better opinion about music from someone else and come back 
and argue then.

get your head out of your ass....all that jump up i mentioned was formula
jump-up...but then again you like music like that dont you...it has what you
think is "soul"...

i like old skool break beat hardcore....my first mix tape ever was a copy of
a copy of a copy of a live ratt pack tape on one side and 2 bad mice on the
other

unlike 90% of the ppl that listen to music i forumulated my opinion on my
own...i dont play drum and bass to be "hard" and i sure as hell dont play it
to be "cool"(thats what drinking is for), nor do i play it to get girls...i
play drum and bass(primarily darkstep/techstep/hardstep whatever you wanna
label it)because its what i love....


nick

ps aphrodite didnt make man o steel...that was sniper(although it is on
urban takeover i think)...and i actually have that record...i got it when my
friend quite spinning and gave me his crate...i also got pressure rise's
stranger in that deal and sci-clones first release...a bunch of other crap
too..

That's like all I play.  I'm the only DJ in the COUNTRY that gets national bookings for Old Skool Hardcore.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} it could be done

Maggie brings up a few very good points.  I think one of the major flaws in
America is the *dj is superstar* attitude.  This falls right in line with
our instant gratification culture.  The reason why we don't all just start
producing quality music?  Well its hard.  There's a lot of technical stuff
that needs to be learned if you want to produce on a professional level.  It
most certainly can be done and that is in all of us as humans to make a
choice about what we can and will do (or will not).

In Europe they don't worship the dj like we do.  Mike Salamon?  You were
just there.  Do you think every kid had a set of turntables in there room or
a synth and computer?  I would say they are trying to produce.  Look at all
of the quality productions that come from Europe.  Of course in Europe they
value art and music more then we do and when I say value I don't mean $$$.

How many djs/live pas/promoters/websites are trying to make money off of the
scene.  There is no money.  No matter how many business cards you make up,
no matter how much flash design you have on your website, no matter how many
mix cds you produce you will not succeed without genuine passion for what
you are doing.  And if you have that then you have already succeeded.

This notion of becoming a super star has always rubbed me the wrong way even
as a producer.  This has actually been my main driving force in not playing
records in front of large crowds for money.  At the last show I played all
of the management firms, djs and performers in general trying to sell
themselves to each other made me sick to my stomach.  I went and sat in the
corner.  Is this really what we are?  Have we been brainwashed into becoming
either consumers or producers and that's it?

Please don't think that any of this is directed any any person(s) in
general.  You all should listen to Maggie shes a very wise girl.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} it could be done

Am I missing something?  I thought DJ's in europe are worshipped like 
gods or something (ie, more "superstar" then in U.S.).  That's how 
europe can fill huge venues with THOUSANDS of people.  Maybe I was 
just mistaken...

As far as being a DJ for the money, I'm completely with you on that.  
I have records and turntables because I like it.  I do want to get 
good enough that I go out to clubs and stuff, but not for the money, 
just for the enjoyment of spinning music that I like and to have 
people dancing to it (well, at least hopefully :P ).  If I make even 
HALF of the investment I put into this, that would be amazing.  That 
is the reason I became so interested in raves in the first place.  
Not because I might see some "superstar" dj, not because of drugs 
(although mass media may think that's what all raves are), but 
because of the music.  I like the whole electronic genre of music.  
There's not really anything in the electronica category that I don't 
like.  And then I get to listen to this music on (usually) high 
quality sound systems, that's what I love about raves.  Plus I met so 
many new people because of it.  it's like going to a concert, but 
instead of listening to one artist for 2 or 3 hours, you can listen 
to a bunch of artists put together by a few talented people over the 
course of 8 or 9 hours (Or even 24 hours like at Field Day).  Even 
though I have never been to what most people consider a concert (one 
band performing on stage) I still think that I have been to several 
concerts.

Anyway, time to get me some sleep :)

how about focusing on the content.  I don't know her personally but her

Subject: {pb-cle} [BSP] Drug Action Interview This Sunday

For those interested:

David Rockello is interviewing me on his internet radio show this 
Sunday the 6th at 8:30 PM (Pacific time.)

The topic of course will be the war on drugs, what it's doing to our 
society, and how we as citizens can take action to work to end this 
hypocritical war on our own people.

To listen to Killradio.org, click this link:

not sure.  the few djs i did meet seemed to think of playing records as a
hobby.  i met a friend of danillo vigorito and he said he mainly just likes
to collect records 'like you americans collect baseball cards, no?  i need
the complete set.'

heh.

in berlin it seemed like people were more rabid fans of record labels as
opposed to individual artists, but i don't know for sure.

Please look at what's going on here. I have read 10+ emails that aren't even 
making points. Its a bunch of bitch slapping, "you suck! no, you suck!" 
emails. Can you at least argue about a topic or take it offline? I'll prolly 
get yelled at for asking, but this is more boring than watching the fucking 
"Real World"

Thanks

Subject: {pb-cle} um...another new guy?

Hey...I recently moved from DC up to Central PA (moo...moo...) where there 
isn't much to do except watch Amish people and admire the sweet smell of 
cows.  I used to go to all of the Ultraworld parties and to Buzz when I 
lived down there.  I haven't been able to find much to do since I've been up 
here, though.  Anyways, I just joined this listserv looking for "rave" 
parties and or clubs to go to in my area or basically anywhere in PA.  Point 
me in the right direction.

Um...thanks.

Hell yeah, man...

I think the "Lush" suite ranks right up there with "The Box" and KLF's
"Space" for greatness.

I'm surprised I only saw one or two people mention KLF or the Jams at
all.....I forgot to add it to my list before sending.

<<also, whoever picked the new order 12" comp i think that counts as an
artist album, so im jealous i didnt pick it myself. >>

thank you.

but if you think this is ok to be classified as "electronic", why not
Bjork's album. I'd venture to say New Order flirted more with traditional
instruments than the instrumentation on "Debut" (with the possible exception
of "The Anchor Song").

Plus, I'd venture to say that Bjork's song-structure on some tracks is more
experimental...

New Order, well, post-Joy Division days anyway, rode that fine line between
pop and underground.

How would one describe 'confusion'

Is it hard house?  Is it hard techno?  Is it progressive?

Call me cheesy, but that riff never gets old to me, and it sticks in my
head, and this was all before 'blade' made it popular.

Wow. That sucks. Well, we have "rave" parties once in a while, here
and there. I live in Cleveland, though; haven't been to a Pittsburgh
shindig in a loonnnnngggggg time. I guess Pittsburgh has some decent
weeklies, like Groove. Check the ROM back on hyperreal.org/raves/
where Trout lists the weeklies.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} um...another new guy?

Actually...I got married in April.  My wife is from up here in HickVille.  I 
met her online (probably my first bad step in the chain of events...since 
she wants a divorce already).  Anyways...she wanted to move up here, which 
is why I am bored off of my ass.  She doesn't party or rave or even dance, 
though, so I usually end up going out alone (which tends to suck).

Yeah, but $143 mil is a drop in the bucket compared to what they MADE from
doing it in those years.

I think, if not handled properly, this may only encourage them.

IF it doesn't sell out, Pittsburgh sucks worse than I EVER could've
imagined.

I'm thinking about bringing heads in from Buffalo for this...

As far as Joker Prod. is concerned...they promoted like shit. I only know
about this because I found a flyer at Record Exchange in Ross Twp. I haven't
seen anything in HyperVinyl or Milk about this....I figured those places
would be LITTERED with flyers.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} it could be done

If you read the bios of big name djs from Europe (anyone from Digweed 
to Adam Beyer), most will say they got started by collecting records, 
and having nothing to do with them, began playing them. Granted, this 
is the early 90's before EVERYONE wanted to be dj. Most people didnt 
know what techno was (at least round here)!?

If anyone has noticed the drought around the cleveland area as of late, you 
might be interested in knowing that there is a giant banner hanging from the 
justice center downtown that says "If you think it's dry now, wait till 
October 17th"  Now the bastards are bragging about it.  I mean, get the hard 
drugs off the street, I agree with that.... but leave the trees alone!!!! 
Nothing bad EVER came from weed and no one can convince me otherwise. This is 
a catastrophe. Someone call NORML.... quick!!!!

AFAIK he's only deejaying. and im not feeling too hip to wading 
into the flood of young suburban white teenagers that laga becomes 
for hiphop shows to pay $20 to hear someone spin records. if he 
was playing live or at a better venue, id consider it but so far 
im not excited and im generally considering not going.

the thing is that i guess new order were more like musicians 
whereas bjork had her album produced by someone else who crafted 
it like a pop album was crafted in the mid-90s. i dont think i was 
against debut being called electronic, i just said i think of it 
as a pop record moreso than an electronic record.

>in columbus tomorrow night:

i dont know about how hiphop shows are down there, but here in 
pittsburgh theyre generally amongst the most annoying crowds. lots 
of white kids with backpacks. ive skipped out on PE, 
blackalicious, kook kieth, wu tang, basically a zillion people 
when they come here because i hate the crowd so much its insane. 
the beatnuts are dope though. i think bagina still has my one 
beatnuts CD, the punk.

hip hop shows in columbus are slightly different... the suburban white kids
are outnumbered about 3-1 by the black community.  the black community that
goes to the shows is generally very diverse from the gang-banging thugs to
the yuppie types.  only thing that sucks about concerts with multiple
rappers is that everyone is trying to get as much mic time as possible so it
usually ends up sounding like shit.  i saw wu tang 3 years ago, and everyone
was rapping the same lines at the same time ... very annoying.

OMG you should have seen the crowd for Kottonmouth Kings, the whitest of the 
white suburbanites. But at least there were j's floating around the crowd

I can't answer your question cause I havent listened to them in a long 
time, and I don't feel like digging up their CD now, but that is the 
song I know ALOT of people say Josh Wink ripped off  for "Higher State 
of Consiosness". Then if anyone has heard Voodoo & Serano - "Blood is 
Pumping", was a massive Trance track last year, but AGAIN, just another 
rip off. And, yes, Blade theme or whatever.

Ah, devil ether. It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel... total loss of all basic motor skills; blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue -- The mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column. Which is interesting, because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it.

well i knew public domain ripped it off with 'operation blade'

and aquagen ripped it off with 'phatt bass'

i dont see how higher state of consciousness really ripped it off... it was
at least primarily based on josh wink's own ideas... and may have sampled
new order's idea in the creation, but everyone samples someone else
normally.. unless it's a breakthrough new style which still has influences
from something else...

I know what your saying about Higher state. I think most people that 
say that says it cause it sounds like it, but Josh Wink, regardless if 
he copied it, really tweaked his song into what it is.

I'm think it'll be good, but the only thing that i'm not digging about it 
the "south beach style" night club with the $200 dollar vip tables yet it's 
"all about the music"

but to each their own.

personally i can't wait to see Behrouz, saw him a few times out in SF when I 
lived out there, Deep Dish should be good as well.

should be a good night

Gotta go with Scott Henry's "The Gift," a dark, peak-hour, progressive, 
stomping, masterpiece on side A, a potpourri of funky house, speed garage 
and boombastic breaks on side B.  DC's finest at his finest, a true musical 
journey.

Come on... it takes it all to make a productive scene.

Despite the corportate politics, strict dress codes, and whatnot -- its
really about the music.

This club will raise some standards for this town and that is not a bad
thing.  What is wrong with having top notch sound and lights?   If others
see this as important then other clubs will follow.  Additionally if it
raises musical awareness of tight shiney shirt wearing muscleheads -- then
it allow a forward move on a larger level.

Nick,
     
Molten Beats and Inside The Machine 
blaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh------------

Maybe you've been "listening" to drum and bass
for 5 or 6 years, but you obviously aren't
"hearing" shit.

You play drum and bass because you love it.....
hmmm...the only place I've ever seen you play is
529 Grant in Akron:

1. I asked you what you had in your bag to play,
and you loudly boasted that you only play hard
gritty shit. I asked like what, and you said old
school.... hard ass drums... only the "hard"
shit. It turns out you played Shake UR Body among
several other played-outs from the past two
years, not to mention many, many weak assed
tracks.

2. Your mixes were wack, brother, I'm sorry. You
don't have a good sense of phrasing, nor any
sense of selection and placement. You also could
not keep your levels at bay, as you went from
almost mute to piercing distortion every five
minutes or so. I must say homeboy you were
taggin' with was good.

3. At the end, you got on the microphone and
started squealing about how your gonna kick
people's asses for someone's shirt being missing,
despite the fact that almost NO PERSON was even
left in the room, since most had journeyed
outside or left altogether.

So who are you really trying to impress? Maybe
you should stick with being just a vinyl junkie.
After all, do you love "the way" you play drum
and bass as much as you love the physical act of
merely "playing" it? 

And who are you to bitch about hearing the same
tracks being played over and over at raves, when
practically all the tracks I heard you play in
that god awful 1 1/2 hrs. were played the fuck
out or weak? 


However old you are, man, your perspectives in
electronic music critique and presentation lack
true experience and maturity.

Please!

G Ride

7pm-9 92.1


Z R#%&Z^D JHR

have you people tried those snoop dogg blunt wraps? they are the 
fuckin' BOMB. try cristal and berry. btw, i dont think snoop 
stopped smoking weed, i think he got all high and paranoid one day 
and got freaked out or embarrassed and said he quit. if that 
motherfucker stops smoking weed, that would be some shit right 
there.
that guy made his whole fortune off of rapping about how great the 
blizunt is and if he renigs on his social contract to all 
americans, then he's nothing but a punk ass bitch. you feelin' me?
fuckin bitch ass snoop.
you people know anything about this?

Yea, norml... so they can represent who? the people everyone with half a 
brain mocks? I can't help but think that norml hurts the image of the rave 
scene.  We're not (all) lifeless losers you know.

But with an email like that... well, you probably have a normyl poster on 
your bedroom door in your mommy's house.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NICK PLEASE

yes my mixing was bad that day...but i couldnt hear shit..the monitors were 
pointed at my feet...i am quite deaf from mixing as i learned with 2 15's 
pointed at my head from about 5 feet away with 800watts going through 
them...

second of all i was piss drunk...which really is no excuse for spouting off 
the way i did...and i later apologized to boomer for getting on the mic and 
being an ass to him...and it wasnt a shirt it was this girl elaina's 
wallet(she was there with my friend gary)...she wound up loosing a 100bux 
cuz of some shadeball inside that place...so please get your facts 
straight...

third off me and my dude(shawn) were told one thing and got another...im not 
going to point fingers on why things were the way they were...but we came 
down there and 20mins before anyone went on boomer drops this tag team story 
on us...wtf is that about? no one should be expected to tag with someone 
they dont know at the last minuete...and you know what...boomer said 
fine...even after shawn and i said we would tag instead of making him tag 
with someone he didnt know(you)...i dont blame that on you...but i wanted to 
get things sorted out...boomer is a nice person and he has nothing but good 
intentions but he has no clue about dj'ing or howto keep dj's happy at his 
events...i will stand up for my peoples anytime, especially shawn cuz he is 
one of the few ppl that stood by me when some really rank shit happened in 
my personal life when alot of ppl turned their backs on me cuz of bs 
rumors...

fourth when i got off you said nice set and said you liked my selection...so 
almost 3 months after the fact you are gonna start this shit? say what you 
mean and mean what you say...if it was awful you should of said so...i 
wouldnt of cared...i know it spun a shitty set that nite...

fifth i played shake it to try to get some ppl into it...i opened with 
metrosound into brand new funk into jah dread into jupiter...your gonna tell 
me that metrosound, jah dread, and jupiter arent gritty? and 3 out of my 
first four tunes were released about a month before i played at 529...and i 
never said old hard gritty shit...i probably said something like...right now 
i have a mixed bag of mostly hard stuff with distorted basslines with amen 
drums...i dont have one truly "old skool" record in my bag right now cept 
for the first record in the lost gemz series...and unlike most ppl i cant 
afford to spend as much money as i'd like on vinyl...hence i dont spin 60 
straight minuetes of promos...

sixth....i played for exactly 45mins...i was watching my watch the whole 
time cuz i had a feeling me and shawn were gonna get fucked over anyways...

look i never claimed to be a great dj...and that nite was not my greatest 
nite, probably one of my worst nites...the biggest problem i had with that 
place was the fact i couldnt hear shit...there was alot of echo cuz there 
wasnt enough sound to fill that room...and like i said the monitors were 
pointed at my feet...but whatever i dont really care im not out djing to be 
some superstar...i only came out that nite to get some table time as i dont 
own a set of working tables at the moment and to help out boomer cuz he said 
he needed someone to open up the room...the only reason i got drawn into 
that shit last nite is cuz im stupid...i shouldve let entropy spout off and 
kept my mouth shut...but instead stood up for ppl that use doa...

personally i dont care what anybody thinks about me...i am comfortable with 
who i am and i dont need the validation of everyone i meet to feel secure in 
myself...

It did come up on the Senate Floor yesterday and was referred to

Rave Bill PASSED! 
The RAVE BILL has passed without any objections on first reading and
it's on it's way to becoming LAW on ,2002. Originally thought up as a
way to shut down raves it has already been used to shut down night clubs
such as Buzz in DC and will soon be used to shut down any business,
school, church, home and anything else the government feels like. This
law will make the president, owner, manager, parent or any controlling
entity of "any place" responsible for the use of "any controlled"
substances and ***** by "anyone" (employee, customer, family) caught
using or distributing inside your "any place" (business, school, church,
home). You will be arrested and fined for the addictions of others. 

The language in this bill is not specific and endangers the freedom of
all Americans. Due to the fact that "controlled substances" or ***** are
everywhere in our society the following is a list of "individuals who
knowingly maintain, manage, control, rent, lease and or make available
for use places where control substances are being used" and will soon be
the objected to arrest, fines, jail time, public humiliation and
degredation... School principals, jail guardians, church ministers,
police chiefs, all business owners, corporate officials, government
officials, parents, mayors, governors, and even the president of the
United States are all "individuals who knowingly maintain, manage,
control, rent, lease and or make available for use places where control
substances are being used." The words "individual" and "places" are
extremely generic and can include anyone and anywhere including and not
limited to you, your family, friends, president, house, business, city,
state and country. 

This is not including alcohol and prescription ***** in this category,
even though they are "controlled substances" and you could be arrested,
put in jail and fined if your employees are caught "using" them in your
place of business. **** use is rampant in our society and this law is
just another way for our government or "Big Brother" to use and bend the
law as they see fit. Money is at the root of everything once again as
our government tacks in yet another way to raise our taxes by being
"authorized to appropriate such sums as necessary" (no limit on budget)
and spend even more money by clogging our judicial systems and creating
more government jobs with the introduction of "Demand Reduction
Coordinators" who will be making $5,900,000 and This money should be
used for educating children and teens. It's a well known fact that
education and not regulation is the best control against illegal ****
use.
Enjoy.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Excited about cleveland

Lets just hope they feature all different kinds of electronic music.  Most
of the time I find Cleveland ignores some of the more underground and
obscure stuff.  It's not the consumers fault they probably don't even know
it exists.  I hope this place does well.  But I will also wish it a fast
demise if they ignore all but the most commercial aspects of the music.
They would be wise to introduce new forms of electronica instead of pushing
music from 2 years ago.

the KLF were amazingly ahead of their time.

i cannot IMAGINE what they'd be like if they kept with things and kept
cranking shit out.

they are genius on so many levels it's not funny.

i usually don't mention them much because i think tom "sukkamah" cox is the
only other shitehead that knows anything about them.

true.  I wasn't referring to touch although I probably should of given them
honorable mention.  I have a soft spot for big sound rigs and love to see
them put to good use.  That's probably my main reason for wanting the super
clubs to play good music.

In response to Doug.  Dont give me that...its all about the music crap.  I see.  And I know whats its about and its definetly not the music.  Its about the act of "raveing" or the act of "clubbing".  At clubs like this one it wouldnt matter if the same two records were being played over and over as long as there is a beat to do a drunken dance to.  Its quite easy to see who loves it and who is simply "cool".  And who cares if it "raises musical awareness of tight shiney shirt wearing muscleheads".  Not that I see how it would in anyway.  Maybe some of us like it without the "muscleheads".
In response to Jeff.  Its wishfull thinking but I dont think it will happen.  And in all honesty I pray they ignore the more obscure stuff.  I agree Touch showcases some great stuff.  But I could do without the stuffy crowd but its small enough I can hangle it.  The musics worth it, though I doubt I will ever be saying the same thing about moda.  
Anyways more of my ranting.  Ive been to places like this in other cities before.  Most recently Dean Martini's in Windsor only because the girl I was visiting worked there and after our show it was right across the street so she took me to see the god awfull place she had to work for a free drink and a few laughs.  Place was disgusting.  Beneath the fancy neon deco was pure filth.  I was sticking to everything.  These people were absolute slobs.  Total fucking meat market and I'm quite positive thats exactly what moda will be and from my POV its disgusting.
Dont get too offended by my jaded, pretentious OPINIONS.  I mean each to their own.  Do what you do and go out and have fun whatever and wherever it may be.  


Final Comment,
Jeremy

it exists. I hope this place does well. But I will also wish it a fast
demise if they ignore all but the most commercial aspects of the music.
They would be wise to introduce new forms of electronica instead of pushing
music from 2 years ago.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Excited about cleveland

I don't think that they will.  I am excited because trendy clubbers are
going to be exposed to something more exciting than hard house and euro
trance.  I guess I am a bit upset that when I tried to do this at groovee i
got yelled at and told that the deep progressive sound was too dark and
boring -- when i knew that all the trendy ass clubbers were going to head
that way.  i enjoy being on the the next wave -- it is my way of moving
people forward and this is one of the things that drives me in this scene --
i love to watch people progress.

 i think it will be fun to watch all the tweakers yell about how the music
sucks, watch all the trendies flock there -- and see what comes out of it.
i wish moda much success because even if they don't push the edge of
electronic music, they found a niche that needed to be filled.

i think it will push the djs who come and play the hits out of the way.   in
my mind it is a step forward that will open the doors for music to progress
on a bigger level and also help to define that which truely IS underground.

> In response to Doug.  Dont give me that...its all about the music crap.  I
see.  And I know whats its about and its definetly not the music.  Its about
the act of "raveing" or the act of "clubbing".

yeah, well, let them say that it is.   they are putting something a bit
different on the table --- and while it is not underground -- it will help
redefine what underground music is about.  and it will make a few more
people aware that there is something else out there.



>>>At clubs like this one it wouldnt matter if the same two records were
being played over and over as long as there is a beat to do a drunken dance
to.  Its quite easy to see who loves it and who is simply "cool".  And who
cares if it "raises musical awareness of tight shiney shirt wearing
muscleheads".  Not that I see how it would in anyway.  Maybe some of us like
it without the "muscleheads".>>>

i suppose i said that all wrong originally and my point didn't come out.  i
was trying to say that if people realize that the shit they thought was cool
really isn't, then things will change.  that's what i am hoping moda will
provide -- diversity.  i hope they stick to their niche and DON'T try much
else.

i can remember hearing them for the first time. it must have been 
90 or 91, i was about 10 or 11. "3 am eternal" came on the radio, 
and i lost it. the little bleepy refrain part was just soooooo 
awesome. i didnt even think that they were anything other than 
american. i had no idea what i was getting into at the time, but 
since then my love and adoration for the KLF has only grown as ive 
learned more and more about them. theyve gotta be one of the best 
artists of all time, right up there with sun ra, lee perry, george 
clinton, drexciya, miles davis, bob marley, massive attack, the 
beatles, etc.

Right on! You have to appreaciate a good quality sound system! So far
the best Cleveland has to offer is the one in Metropolis, and all that
is, is very loud! It still sounds like you are under 10 feet of water.

true.  I wasn't referring to touch although I probably should of given
them
honorable mention.  I have a soft spot for big sound rigs and love to
see
them put to good use.  That's probably my main reason for wanting the
super
clubs to play good music.

I'm sorry Doug I do respect you for being a indie record store owner.  That
does take balls.  I also don't doubt your love for music but how is the deep
progressive sound the next wave?  I mean will we be playing electro clash in
the clubs in Cleveland in 3 years?  I just don't understand what sets the
tone in Cleveland for whats good and whats not in dance music.

Back in the day (yes I'm going there) you were a young kid that was
subjected to all kinds of underground electronica.  I guess times have
changed.  But I think we are doing a huge disservice to the general partying
public.  There is soooooo much good dance music on this planet.  Its a shame
a club (read: a sound system) like moda wont highlight these different
sounds.  You have to take chances if you want to be different.

a few promoters at touch do bring in some good talent, but the sound is
fucking awful.  in fact, the sound was never that good before the new owner

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Talent: 

Titonton Duvant - Techno, Wellknowndjs.com, Columbus, OH : Titonton wrote 
his first song at the age of five entitled "Journey to the Stars". As a 
young child, he was drawn to the up beat rhythms of disco and the 
futuristic sounds of early electronic music. Now behind the turntables 
this mild mannered gentleman seems possessed by the very spirit of the 
music and he channels it's energy into the audience. Titonton's djing is 
like his music, highly emotional and never stationary. Titonton has played 
throughout the US, Canada, and Europe including gigs in Chicago, Detroit, 
Boston, New Orleans, Toronto, London, Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam, 
Copenhagen, Brussels and Berlin. He has played at least 60 gigs a year 
since 1997. He has also gained notoriety as a recording artist releasing 
music on labels all over the world. His well recieved style has earned him 
a spot in Tim Barr's book A Rough Guide to Techno as well as a mention in 
Dan Sicko's book Techno Rebels and interviews in Urb, Groove magazine 
(Germany), Keyboard (France), and AB (Spain) to name a few. 

DJ D8A - Hardhouse/Hardcore, Buckwyld Entertainment, Dayton, OH : 
Performing throughout the Midwest for the past four years, DJ D8A supplies 
a powerful peak-time set of hard-house tracks that can take any event to 
the next level. 
Lacing beat over beat and building up the excitement, D8A has set floors 
ablaze with his furious style across the Midwest. His tour schedule 
includes shows almost every weekend throughout Ohio, Indiana, and 
Kentucky, and D8A has been seen rocking parties in both Chicago and New 
York. He has dropped hard house sets that have blown the roof off of 
numerous events and can be booked to play several different types of 
music. Whether it's Chicago House, Progressive House, or absolutely 
rip-roaring Hardcore, D8A's sets are not to be missed. 

DJ Katana - Trance - Cybersound Productions -Indy, IN  DJ Katana is a 
Trance DJ from NYC that has played at clubs to the likes of Twilo, 
Danceteria, Club USA, Pyramid, in NYC, Celcilia's and the Chamber Room in 
Colorado, Casanova's and The Green Room in Maui, as well as gigs in Hong 
Kong, London, Paris, Madrid, Naples, Holland, and The Philippines. Coming 
to us from Indianapolis we at Monster Productions are proud to have this 
pioneering talent of the dj-as-artist movement headlining this event for 
us in event in Columbus. 

Chewie - BBGun - Intelligent DNB - Columbus, OH : What Can I say, He's one 
of the best DNB DJ's in Ohio, nuff said. 

Aus-10 - MythOdic Productions - DNB / Jungle - Columbus, OH : This guy is 
just now getting his feet wet in the world of dance music, but it he has 
already taken his music to the masses all over the state of Ohio. Playing 
in Cleveland, Lima, Dayton, and Columbus. This is a DJ to watch out for. 
He is all about the killer vibe and making everyone have the best 
experience they can possibly have. This guy is definitely starting to make 
a mark on the club and party scene in this state. This is a DJ that you 
are going to want to watch out for. 

DJ Will Robinson - Angry Kangaroo Records - Groovy Breakbeats - Nashville, 
TN : Will Robinson has been spinning and producing records since early 
1998 under many different aliases including AMtrack, Scout 52, and DJ 
Strangelove. His eclectic mix of deep and groovy breaks has 
been featured on 91.7 Revolution FM and manifested itself into the sound 
now heard on Afterburn, a weekly breaks show on 88.5 Burn FM. Will 
Robinson has graced the decks at many a party in the Kentucky/Tennessee 
area showcasing 
singles from his very own Angry Kangaroo records with a mix of classics 
and rarities sure to move even the most discerning dance floors. "He's 
f!@king bad ass" 

Tom Sawyer - RaversOnly.com / AirplaneClique - HardHouse - OH : Tom Sawyer 
is a moving up in coming dj... His hardhouse moves you and at the end of 
the night, your head throbs from how much it hits you. (In a good way) 

Kitchen Sync - American Cheese - Happy Hardcore - Columbus, OH : Kevin is 
a relative newcomer to both the rave scene and the world of DJ'ing. He was 
first exposed to electronic music in the form of generic eurodance and 
"speed techno" albums that he began downloading as MP3's in 1997. Artists 
such as Scooter and DJ Quicksilver were early influences, cementing a love 
for cheesy synth-based techno. While on one of his nightly forays into one 
of the servers that he frequented, Kevin came across some generically 
labeled "Happy Hardcore" MP3's, including Jimmy J's seminal track, "99 Red 
Balloons". That was the beginning of the end... (hehe j/k Kevin) The 
future looks bright for 2002 and Kevin's involvement with happy hardcore / 
the rave scene. He intends on making frequent mixes, many of which will be 
internet-exclusive, as well as produce bigger and better tracks and play 
out whenever he can. American Cheese is the Mid-west's savior for happy 
hardcore, and Kevin is very glad to be a part of it. 

DJ Ribbit - PlayTek Industries - Trance - Columbus, OH : polishing off the 
evening with a set that will leave you in awe, DJ Ribbit
brings you some of the most uplifting upbeat trance in columbus. look for 
free cd giveaways during his playtime.

it's all about the party...

THIS SATURDAY OCTOBER 5, 2002:

GREYBOY
(Ubiquity Records, San Francisco)

www.ubiquityrecords.com

www.djgreyboy.com

Come check one of our favorite downtempo jazzy hip-hop producers from the 
west coast. This guy has been at it for well over a decade now and is 
still Ubiquity's best selling artist. His latest production, Mastered the 
Art, has a heavy Italian feel to the instrumentals--as acoustic guitars 
and strings hug the fat beats and catchy bass lines. In fact this heavy 
dose of Italiana led him to ask high flying Italian producer Nicola Conte 
to remix the title track. Chase-scene suspense tracks also give Mastered 
The Art a soundtrack-like quality. These are nicely balanced by bouncing 
hip-hop party tracks.

While the acid jazz phenomenon was brewing in Europe in the early 1990s, 
Greyboy became the first American producer to mix beats with jazz. When he 
first started making beats, he was making hip-hop. Since he couldn't find 
MC's to work with, he decided to try the jazz thing and lace his tracks 
with live instruments instead. That's where Karl Denson and the Greyboy 
Allstars came into the picture. Karl Denson is known for his work with 
members of James Brown's band, Miles Davis, and Lenny Kravitz. The Greyboy 
Allstars have gone on to find huge success. Greyboy is also famous for 
starting a hip-hop label called P-Jays with world famous skateboarder Rob 
Dyrdek. 


Hope to see you all atthe party THIS SATURDAY AT TOUCH. Thanks to all who

Time".

There will be all the moving flashing lights, lazor lights, and also
visual effect screens and large screen video games.

       This is an all ages event, though we expect a level of maturity.

it, then don't.

Wed Oct 16               ELECTROCLASH FESTIVAL 2002                Columbus

Electroclash Festival 2002
Featuring Peaches, Chicks on Speed, W.I.T.,
Tracy and the Plastics, and DJ Larry Tee
Wed, Oct / 16
Black Box show on Mershon Stage

"The most exciting band you've yet to hear."
--NME on Chicks on Speed

Taking cues from early Eighties electopop icons such as The
Human League and Depeche Mode today's Electoclash scene is an
international phenomenon that is having great fun rewiring old
school drum machine beats and stripped down analog synth
melodies supporting oh so arch vocals, not to mention adopting
its mascara-in-overdrive retro glam style factor.  Drawn from
the lineup of this year's edition of Brooklyn's influential
annual Electroclash Festival (organized by Electroclash supremo
Larry Tee) this tour bring together the ultra provocative
rudegirl rhymes of the incomparable Peaches, the
trans-continental multimedia performance art spectacle of
Berlin-based trio Chicks on Speed plus the bonus fun factor of
Williamsburg faves W.I.T. and Tracy and the Plastics.

Sat Nov 30                    ROCK THE BELLS 2                       Dayton

Wishing Well and Groovefuel Recordings, on Saturday November 30th, bring 
you.......

"Rock the Bells 2, The Second Ringing" featuring the following djs and/or 
acts........


Donald_Glaude ( Moonshine Records, Eden Records ) Los Angeles, California
A veteran DJ for over 15 years, Donald Glaude has cemented his reputation 
as a crowd-rocking favorite and one of the most in demand artists in the 
country. He is one of those rare DJs who perceives their role to be that 
of an all-around entertainer and performer. He exudes energy, dropping 
track after funky track, arms aloft, and has been known to join the 
dancers on the floor. Join us at Rock the Bells 2 to witness the man DJ 
Dan considers "one of the most entertaining DJs in America to watch live." 
__________________________________________________

Huge Surprise Orlando Breaks dj to be announced seconds before he takes 
stage. This guy has accomplished many things in the breaks world and 
people all over are playing his records. His blend of progressive and 
funky breaks will leave you in awe and wanting more, he flat out rocks the 
decks, and has done it in Dayton before.
__________________________________________________

UF0_! ( Phunkatech Records, Phylum Recordings, Circa ) New York City
Featured in magazines such as URB, XLR8R, Lotus, Mixmag, Knowledge, and 
many other 'zines, UFO! is one of the most sought after producers in the 
United States. Record labels across the country clamor for a UFO! remix, 
which guarantees a dance floor hit. A Bay Area native, UFO! pioneered the 
San Francisco Drum and Bass scene and co-founded the much respected 
Phunckateck collective, creating a new community in music. Now residing in 
New York City he is rocking more crowds then ever.
__________________________________________________

Charly ( Bassdrive, Well Known Djs ) Philadelphia
Spinning around the East Coast over the past few years has gained Charly 
the reputation for clean sets, crazy mixes, and an incredible vibe behind 
the decks. Headlining around the country with UFO!, Juan Atkins, DJ Seen, 
and AK1200, has earned, as well as provided, Charly immense respect. Once 
Charly is seen in action, it's easily understood why she has been touted 
to be the next best thing for the US Drum-n-Bass Scene. At the young age 
of only 18 she is sure to be the next superstar in drum and bass.
__________________________________________________

Trevor_Lamont ( NateFx, Soulbrothaz, Aliensquad ) Lexington KY
Trevor is one of the most respected and skilled DJs in the Midwest and is 
never to be missed as you might miss something spectacular. His experience 
reflects on his sets as he can always work the crowd with his soulful 
house music and break it down to its roots.vs.Samm-e ( Soulbrothaz, U.S. 
Hispanix, House Purists, Dr. Sun Prod, Senor MTSU ) Murfreesboro
Samm-e is one third of the nationally acclaimed Teamsters crew consisting 
of him, Halo, and Trevor Lamont. When he hits the decks there is a vibe 
that comes over the room and with him on two while T is on two, things 
could get crazy, and memorable.
__________________________________________________

Guy_Smilee ( www.gagproductions.com, www.neutralmusic.net ) Rochester, New 
York
Guy Smilee is one of the most popular happy hardcore djs in the US and 
with Jumper by his side they always bring the house down. Guy can scratch 
with about any part of his body, and make sure you watch on November 30th 
as you can see him in action. Like I said Jumper will be by his side and 
you all know he can rock it and let's show him how much we love him in 
Ohio. w/ Mc_Jumper ( GAG, Ruffneck Playaz Crew, www.neutralmusic.net ) 
Rochester, New York
__________________________________________________

Big Regional Surprise Act to close out the main room and rock it for an 
hour. These guys have been ripping it for a year now and have been ripping 
it all together for about 2 years. They made their debut last year on 
December 15th and will be closing out the main room at 5 with a set to be 
remembered for a lifetime.
__________________________________________________

Kid Chaos ( In the Groove, Infinity Prod )
This house music enthusiast is always a hit on the dancefloor. His fusion 
of disco house and groovy tech-house has helped him gain recognition 
throughout the midwest and get him on lineups with names such as Too 
Short, Sandra Collins, and more.
__________________________________________________

HE10 ( In The Groove ) Tucson, Arizona
Coming to us all the way from Tucson he is ready to throw down the dopest 
uplifting trance we have seen in a long time. The awesome track selection 
and flawless mixing will bring him back to our city more often, hopefully.
__________________________________________________

Mike_Donovan ( Bounce Theory, Scarab Records ) Dayton, Ohio
Mike is co-founder of the Bounce Theory in Dayton Ohio. Deep tech-house 
music for the sophisticated listener featuring smooth, deep, jazzy 
grooves. He will be promoting his new cd Paint the Town Redd so be close 
to the decks and you might get a copy.
__________________________________________________

Chromix_live pa ( Groovefuel Recordings, Do:Loop Records ) Cleveland
This Northern Ohio progressive and hard trance producing phenomenon has 
been writing tracks since the age of 15. His unique and powerful live set 
will leave you begging for more and make sure you watch out for his first 
release on Groovefuel Recordings later this year.
__________________________________________________

Matthew_Kelly ( 4-Score Productions, Katatonic Resident ) Nashville
This crazy scratching breaks master representing Nashville will make his 
first Wishing Well appearance and a long awaited one at that. Make sure to 
catch his set as his whole crew including Michelle make it up from 
Nashvegas.
__________________________________________________

Clay-Born ( Wishing Well, Breakline Crew ) Louisville
Clay is always bringing a new crate of records and a totally awesome 
performance to every event which keeps his sets fresh and new and the vibe 
totally flowing to the deep basslines and dirty beats that make up 
nu-skool breaks.
__________________________________________________

Foursqare ( Wishing Well, Metronomix ) Louisville
Last year around this time a dj was born to the scene to show everyone how 
to rock it, Foursqare style. The dope ass house sets she drops are enough 
to make people like Paul Johnson and other house legends say WHOA!!! 
__________________________________________________

e21 ( :SCENE:, Stellar Gruve ) Atlanta
The man behind SCENE Ohio made his first Wishing Well debut at the last 
Rock the Bells and rocking it this year will be no different. The trance 
selections he brings to the table are amazing and his attitude towards the 
music and his presence on stage show it all.
__________________________________________________

Nero_X ( Hypnotik Therapy ) Cincinnati
You thought you wouldn't hear the techno but what party is a party without 
techno. Get there early to hear this man bring it hard. Dino is an up and 
coming superstar in the Ohio scene so look out for him whenever you can.
__________________________________________________

Jigglypuff ( Independent ) Cincinnati
If you thought Guy Smilee was enough happy hardcore for the night you were 
totally mistaken because this guy will bring it in early to set the vibe 
and the night off on the right foot. Let the man we call Chester know how 
much we love him and be right next to the decks when he throws down.
__________________________________________________

Def_Leper ( Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids ) Dayton
What can I say? Sliced bread had a good, long run but now this is the best 
thing to hit the scene. If you miss this set you should be shot with many 
Fruit Pebbles until your bum is sore. The 80's pop and hardcore mixture 
will have you dancing on tables and screaming at the top of your lungs.

Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well

house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno 
- Chris Anderson is one of those rare jacks-of-all-trades who has his hand 
in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic 
culture and if you like hard, techy, funky and acidic beats - look no 
further!

www.djrip.com - Hard Progressive/Hard House - You know him, you love him 
and after last year's performance, we just had to bring him back.

over the U.S. and Canada and on into Europe.  His production work includes 
works with Angel Alanis, Bam Bam, Alex Peace and more.  Rip is now taking 
his efforts to the next level moving his work into the progressive/tech

that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002

should KNOW not to miss them. This Face Down, redefining their sound with 
a new singer, just won a battle of the bands for the Rolling Rock Town

either. Presale ! tickets are available via the bands for $10, otherwise 
you'll have to pay $12 at the door. PLUS, if you buy your presale tickets 
from BLU or the BLU street team, you will recieve 2 complimentary tickets 
to a fan appreciation show we will be having at Peabody's on August 12th 
with the Bedroom All-Stars. Also, a source has just contacted me and 
informed me that there will be a limited supply of FREE BEER at the Odeon 
show for presale ticket holders who bought their tickets from BLU. We're 
not sure whether these complimentary refreshments will be inside or 
outside The Odeon, but hey, it's FREE BEER, so who cares, right?!?!

You've picked a lousy battle here, Brian. I have no problem with the
actual act of consuming of pot and neither do you -- you have a
problem with the stereotype of the dumb pothead, not the actual
*choice* of consuming THC.

I think the motivation of the typical pot user is to get high, duh!
But all kinds of people like to get high, not just total losers with
no jobs who wear tie-dye. :)

And there are plenty of pot smokers who also have their Phds and are
brilliant contributors to science, the arts, life in general. Quit
being such an "just synthetics, please" snob!

Wrong meaning implied. Rephrase as: "You have a problem with the
*stereotypical* dumb pothead." 

'Cause I know he ain't got no problems with stereotyping them ... (!)

There are global trends, certainly you can agree with that.  In the past,
every underground musical trend could be found in Cleveland clubs - for
years and years.  I think we started to miss the boat for a while when
trance became the prevelant sound - think muzik, mix mag, jockey slut.   I
think the clubs around hear totally missed that era and went straight into
the hard house (which replaced trance in 98-99 -- when all the UK clubs had
"no trance - no glowsticks" signs on their doors).   Cleveland latched on to
hard house, which I think is due to its blue collar status.  From there the
trend went back to a slowed down pace with more tribal rhythms and a deeper
progressive sound.   When people talk about "miami" -- that is what is
associated with it.  The trend for this style has been in place for a year
and a half. On a global scale, we are reaching the tale end of it.   When
"dark beat" by oscar g finally gets released, that will be the record that
will peak the soudn out.  From that point on there will be tons of copy-cat
records and the sound will become watered down and rapidly get stale.  This
tribal/prog/deep progressive sounds is INSANELY popular everywhere else.  It
is the club sound of the moment, and you can't go out in Cleveland to hear
much of it.  I am very anxious to see how Cleveland handles it.

As for your electro clash comment,  I'm not sure what is going to happen
with that.  The industry types were saying that sound will be a huge driving
force in the industry for the next several years.   Madonna's new album is
supposed to solidify this position.  Personally,  I don't know how to feel.
Most of the "ravers" who I see get a taste of it COMPLETELY reject it.  I
see a few people who run around and badmouth electroclash very heavily --
and trash talk how awful it is.  I don't know how this is going to effect
the club scene yet -- I know both Mike Filly and Rob Black incorporate some
of it into their sets.   Rob Sherwood was back in town two weeks ago and
played a 45 minute set of it at Spy, and half the crowd really dug it and it
was not energetic enough for the other half.   I think there is a strong
possibility that electroclash will skew into a new form of
alternative/underground -- we'll see.


<<< I just don't understand what sets the tone in Cleveland for whats good
and whats not in dance music.>>>
I don't know either... it is relative to the person making that judgement
call. It is also a matter of taste and personal preference.  I don't think
dance music should be labeld good or bad, but we all do it.   I think that
as a whole, the mindset of Cleveland has become "he who plays the hardest
and fastest with the least amount of breakdowns wins".   I think so much
music has gotten lost.   I believe that Cleveland has not had a taste of the
"prog" sound, and when they do it is going to be huge because they have not
had much of it.  I'm not going to enjoy hearing about this "new sound" when
it isn't anything new or special, but at least it is a change in acceptable
energy levels and it breaks that "hard" mentality down and people might
actually start listening again.

Like I also said in the beginning, I think Moda will raise the standards.
When the next club opens they will not be able to squeak by with mediocre
sound and lights.  If you go sticking unaccessable music in there, then they
stand a greater chance of failing.  If they fail then the next profiteereing
club owner won't see the value in top notch sound and lights.  This is why I
said, let them find their niche.   I think that they they are going to raise
the intelligence level of clubbers just enough so that someone else can come
in and educate.

Don't forget -- this IS a high fasion club with a strict dresscode and it
will cost a lot of money to go there.  This is not an underground club, so
don't try to have those expectations.  If they have nights where they lower
their standards, and play a bit more cutting edge, then that would be cool -
but let them find their friday saturday niche in the clubbing community. If
they succeed I see things getting better for everyone -- it provides a point
of reference for what underground is.  No longer will a dj be able to get
popular in the "underground rave" scene by playing dated club tracks.    I'm
having a very difficult time conveying all of my thoughts on this - I just
see it as being good.

That's part of what I am trying to say!   If the superclubs get popular, it
creates room for the alternative to co-exist.

Subject: {pb-cle} VELVET TUESDAYS - last legs


I hate to say it, but Velvet's days are numbered.  I got word from the
owner of Zythos.  I guess it has been slowing down, the numbers are not
spectacular.  He is going to let me know in November if he wants us to
keep doing it or not.  He was leaning towards trying something else.  So,
enjoy it while it lasts.

Oct/Nov have some good acts:

Boompsie is next week, I really hope people can show her a good time --
she is driving from Cleveland just to play here.  Ed Umm is back again, I
think he had one of the best sets of anyone to play there, the last time
he played.  And Shawn is rocking it live twice.  2 Lukes are doing their
live PA again.   In addition, the sounds of DC space, Osmotic and
Bassclown are slated for the night.

I mean, if people can come out and support then maybe the night can
continue.  But for now, I just say, enjoy it while it lasts.  Because
every week there is the opportunity to hear some music, you will not hear
at any other night in Pittsburgh on a regular basis.  It upsets me that
the night is going to stop, but there is not much I can do except to
continue to promote it and hope people come out, and cross my fingers for
a miracle.

Granted, Tuesday is a ruff night, but I dunno.. I'm just letting you all
know, this is your last 2 months worth of Velvet to check out unless it
picks up again.

metropolis has a very very loud system...but i think its loud in the wrong
way...you are getting slammed with highs and mids...to the point your ears
hurt and ring for two days after being there...the sound guy at metropolis
knows his shit and he is cool as fuck...i hope he gets more bins or trades
some of those full range boxes for bins or something....

someone around here needs to build a reggae style system....ie 90% bins 10%
full range...bass should be felt in the chest to the point that it can make

Subject: {pb-cle} ADRENALINE in October

im not sure but i dont think ive posted a line up or
spewed out any kind of spam since i started this night
in June. well, this month i figured id post a line up
just for the hell of it. i hope i dont jinx the night
by doing this.

Oct. 4th - Dave Breakwell - dave will be mixing up a
blend of house and breaks. come see him off before he
packs his bags and heads out of the country.
(hoodwink, pgh)

Oct. 11th - Invizible Enigma vs. Anthony Fugate -
Barry (inviz enig) throws down some real funky house
and is known to drop a fingerlickin track or two on
the breaks side. with Anthony's live percussion act
mixed in, there will be a fire hazard on stage for the
hour and a half they will play. Plus, with Jazzy Jeff
next door at Groove.... this night will make you feel
like a true soul brotha.

Oct. 18th - Ryan Matthews n'at - i really dont need to
say anything here.... except watch your back when all
the candy girl groupies storm the stage. theyve been
know to riot.

Oct. 25th - Smartie - its a love hate thing.
regardless, the kid is just plain good. i know ive
mentioned this before but, if you missed him at "wish
upon a star" at the nest then you'll want to check his
shit out here. Smartie is a huge fan of Mark Farina.
so with mark at groove and smartie in adrenaline...
this night will definitely make you creamy.

there.... was that cheezy enough for all of you? good.

Adrenaline is 21+ proper id required. if you pay the
said amount to get into groove then you can freely
walk between groove and adrenaline (if youre 21). if
you only pay to get into adrenaline then you can not
go into groove unless you pay theyre full amount.

Adrenaline is $5 to enter. $2 drink special from 9pm
to 11pm. adrenaline closes at 2am.

i give away about 50 free admission passes every week.
so if you come down just come find me and ill give you
a couple passes for next time.

clevr

speaking of reggae, i wouldnt mind seeing some in the area... if 
anyone's interested in black chiney from dc, they tear the shit up 
on their mixtapes... they cost 5,000 to book (or at least they did 
when i inquired to them last year)  www.blackchiney.com i think is 
the web address...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} reggae was Re: {pb-cle} Excited about cleveland

the cotton club in cleveland(yes that cotton club at 141 and miles)has
reggae concerts every week it seems...usually dancehall more than
roots...they've had the likes of beenie man, elephant man, bounty killer,
and many other great acts...two cusins usually puts on these shows...if you
listen to the college stations when they play reggae they tell you bout all
the shows...

there is just one problem...alot of jamicians on the east side are kinda
nutty...they still think they living in kingstons "jungle"...one the
cleaners i used to work with at ab hard got stabbed by one over a newspaper

that being said...i think beenie man is coming back to cleveland in the next
few weeks....hes on tour again(is he ever not on tour?!)

I haven't been there in six months, but when I was there last the mids and
highs were lacking the most.   The equalization was all off and all the
vocals were EXTREMELY muffled.  You could not understand lyrics or talking
in tracks -- and with every breakdown it seemed as if the music was shut
off.  Maybe they have fixed it since then.

You are forgetting Justin Timberlake and Big Tymers, asshole

And to think you were so cool wearing that red headband, Tom. Thought you 
were a big tymer huh? Now I guess you're just a poser like the rest of us.

Don't play that game. Don't be that guy.

I think part of the problem is some peoples' insatiable taste for the 
"better high"... which will go beyond marijuana and into more dangerous 
drugs.

The smart people who smoke pot as recreation don't seem to be the problem.

Its the dumb people who prioritize it, lose money off of it as well as the 
dumb people looking for the drug with the bigger kick.

I have a good friend who has no hot water running in his house (doesnt pay 
the gas bill), can barely make car payments, and lost his cell phone twice 
(no he has NO telephone), yet works 45 hours a week.

How does he seem to have a cut of pot every couple of days? What will happen 
if he wrecks, or needs to make a huge car repair?

Smoking pot habitually degrades motivation and creates low aspirations. 8 
out of 10 habitual stoners I know only care about how or when they are going 
to get high next.

What happens when they are unable to work their dead end job and have no 
money for retirement? Make their pothead kids pay for it? Make tax payers 
pay for it? live on the street bumming change?

It degrades society.

Stupid people who abuse drugs make me angry.

<<Smoking pot habitually degrades motivation and creates low aspirations. 8

Agreed, Paul.

But the bigger question at stake here is: What right does government have to
make that decision for its people?? Especially in a time when the abuse of
alcohol exhibits equally detrimental societal problems.

One can argue that habitual drinkers (read: alcoholics) exhibit the same
behavioral patterns, and some go even further, with things like spousal and
child abuse, violent fits of rage, drunk driving, etc.

I'd venture to say that alcoholism bears a striking resemblance to habitual
pot smoking, and ups the ante substantially.

I'm not disagreeing with you here, but I think my argument is equally as
valid. You can draw only very slight distinctions between the abuses of the
two drugs.

When abused, any substance or activity done to an extreme can be a plague on
individuals, families or society. Food, work, sex, "clubbing" or
"partygoing" and yes, drugs too. There is, however, a gaping hypocrisy in
what is "socially acceptable" abuses and those that are currently classified
as illegal.

Why say 'the dumb people prioritize drugs' when you could just as
easily have said 'dumb people?' We all hate idiots here; I didn't
think that was up for debate.

Sounds like an idiot to me, but he shouldn't be the poster child for
"pot smoker" when most pot smokers are just regular people who know
how to pay their bills.

Playing video games habitually degrades motivation and creates low
aspirations. 8 out of 10 habitual video game players I know only care
about how or when they are going to play video games next.

A lot of young people aren't saving for their retirements, and
they're all stupid. I don't know a single person putting as much
money into their retirement savings plans as I do.

So does country music. Oh wait, was this just my unimformed opinion?

They make me sad, actually.

Okay maybe not a direct quote that says "talent".   He still was an N'Sync member.  That right away makes him suck.  How you can appreciate his music is beyond me.  And he aint got shit on Michael Jackson.  His voice is studio enhanced and his concerts are lip-synced.

For tha record, I never attacked any gay people.  Those were stupid friends of mine, and though people may be judged on tha company they keep, I did not participate.  I thought a better comeback would come from you.

But does Justin have soul?

That is the real question.

On a little bit more of a serious note-

I like a lot of Michael Jackson.

...I really don't like Justin Timberlake though. Maybe if I heard some good 
stuff and I didn't have to look at him. Even then I doubt it...

Which leads me to my next point:

If you have uneducated, immoral parents, you'll produce uneducated, immoral
children.

I would hope that the Springer-Generation would teach us this if nothing
else...

Well, that fine gentleman that I mentioned before (the one without gas or a 
phone) have very well educated and moral parents...

So what gives?

Was it the school he went to? The friends he made? Were his parents too lax? 
Did they baby him and not teach him the lessons of life? ...or were they too 
harsh on him and he rebelled?

There are way too many variables involved... it makes my head hurt and makes 
me not want to be a parent.

who knows if he has soul. all i know is he's less white and more 
real than michael is at this point. i used to love michael, now i 
cant even look at him or listen to his music. i just feel 
embarassed for him and wish for his sake he would just disappear.

Hi everyone,

I'm new to the PGH-CLE rave scene and I'm here to learn from you folks. I 
just started DJing some progressive stuff and am really interested in what 
goes on in this area. I just moved to the suburbs around Pittsburgh (hey, 
don't hold that against me!) and can't wait to hear what's shaking on the 
rave scene. I come from around DC where drum and bass seems to be super 
huge, and, well, I'm looking for a change!

Rave well, folks!

Love and music =p
DJ Dippy M

he(jacko) suing sony cuz his last album didnt sell well...but as i remember 
it sony spent about 6million on his last video...remember that video...it 
had chris tucker, marlon brando, and a few other celebs in it...the way i 
see it they marketed his last album just as well as anyone could expect them 
too...maybe mj just needs to realise that his music sucks now...and ppl only 
come out to see him live just to see if he is really as horrific in person 
as he looks on tv and what not...lets face it...he turned himself into a 
white woman...he shouldve never mad another album after bad...he couldve 
just taken the money and ran...bought a nice island in the west indies...and 
been a recluse..lord knows if i had 100s of millions of dollars thats what 
i'd do...and id only populate it with super-models and porno girls...

interesting side note...jacko owns the entire beatles catalog...everytime 
you hear a beatles song on the radio jacko is getting paid...

oh and by the way....jacko sold his soul sometime around 89(thats just for 
you tom)

flame on

Well, I dunno, Fabio was here a couple years ago.  Were you at that show?
He rocked it.  Although Pittsburgh broke my heart that night, the entire
arena emptied out right as Freaky Flow finished and Fabio was going on.

I don't think Grooverider + Fabio can ever come way too late.  I think it
is a miracle that they are coming at all.  Gives pittsburgh heads a second
chance to show they're not complete idiots when it comes to DNB.

Fabio definately kicked some ass at the Spring Breaks at Rostraver.  I am 
very excited to see him again as well as see Grooverider for the first time.

you mean like hidden agenda, photek, johnny l, t power, etc? the 
people who left jungle for the better slower music like breaks, 
house, 2-step, and broken beats? yeah, youre still just a sucker. 
shit, 4 hero nearly INVENTED hardcore/jungle music and they quit 
it cause it was wack. your arguments are weak. MJ cole engineered 
way more tracks than youd know up until like 98, since the 
jungle "producers" "making" the tracks couldnt keep up with his 
ass.

As much as I detest about 2step garage, people need to understand 1 thing
.. and this is the one thing people in the US don't get about DNB (myself
included at times):

  It's about HAVING FUN

Basically the whole concept is just fun, having fun, drinking and ladies
shaking their asses.

>notes and what not

are you joking? johnny l had 2+ years off of drum and bass where 
he put out multiple garage singles, and his new jungle track is 
supposedly very garage influencd. t power doesnt make jungle at 
all anymore, 4 hero make it very rarely, photek hadnt made any 
jungle tunes in over 2 years prior to his recent releases which 
are basically fast house records anyway, hidden agenda has been 
making non-jungle exclusively now for at least 3-4 years. bizzy b 
hasnt made shit for jungle, but hes been banging out the garage. 
remarc hasnt made jungle since 1997 (the last record i can 
remember him making was the sega record on sub base) yet he's 
released garage tracks much more recently. this doesnt even count 
the other jungle producers who have made garage tracks, of which 
there are many. so yeah, id say the vast majority of them quit 
making jungle, but a few have returned in limited fashion. the 
fact that so many of jungle and hardcore's originators are now 
involved only in the breaks, 2-step, or broken beat scenes speaks 
volumes about the decline in quality of drum and bass........

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fw: D&B Arena: 'The Planets - Triple Pack EP / Grooverider -
 Fabriclive.03 / Dillinja REMIX' [4/Oct/2002]

speaking of which...i played about 5 records at abasso's last nite...they 
had some progressive dj's on before me...they were playing really downtempo 
stuff...anyways...the guy running the nite tells me i can have a half hour 
to close out the nite...i step up...drop my first mix and the dancefloor 
actually starts moving...i get to my fifth record and im informed that the 
management doesnt want me to play because they only want progressive played 
at the club...

i dont understand why anyone would chase a dj off the decks that is actually 
making ppl dance and probably buy more drinks just because you are biased 
against something you obviously know very little about(drum and bass 
music)...

so much for "open" decks...the dude running the nite was pretty nice 
though...he actually wants to kick it...

closer by marky and xrs makes girls dance...its not a bad tune but its not a 
great tune either...but since it makes girls jiggle their goods it can stay 
in my bag

I believe I spent $28 to see Underworld, and less than that to see
Orbital.

I like Deep Dish, but there's no way I'm going to spend $30 to see them.

That is craziness.  I would probably go if it was cheaper.  Plus, if it
costs that much to get in, imagine their drink prices!  I don't have
that kinda money to burn.

It might not be from ctnproductions.... all the email viruses create fake
headers so you can't always be sure who it came from.  More than likely it
was a person who had both you and matt in their address book.

yo, the party had a good lay out, meaning the ideas were nice. All i can
really bitch about is the fact that they had 2 tents they were using for the
djs/hip hop acts that were going on that night. When me and Ken got there,
Ken was suppose to play the second tent, but they didnt have decks set up.
Funny that Sonny asked us if we happend to bring a mixer or any tables...
(heh, yea moron, we packed up turntables for fun and drove from OHIO)
anyways.. needless to say, Ken didnt play as well as some others, but i had
an awsome time watching some of the drag races that went on.
I didnt stay to see freaky flow, we left at 10pm cause I hate the drive home
from shitsburgh.. ;)

i saw underworld in toronto, so it was like $15 american. anyway, 
getting me to spend any more than $10 to see someone spinning 
records would be really difficult. it would have to be like 3 top 
level deejays and theyd have to be fairly uncommon. and even then 
i dont know that id ever pay more than $20 to see any number of 
deejays no matter who they are in the limited time/space frame of 
a club. 

keep in mind, i saw jazzanova for $10 in cleveland, theyll put 
deep diss to shame in the deejaying category. algorithim was $10 
also, i believe, and he'll crush deep pish into the ground. 
cleveland has it good already, dont sleep on what youve got.

Wake up people! $10? I don't think you can see DD
anywhere for that cheap. I think $30 is reasonable
to see them @ this new club. Sasha and Digweed
were just at the Agora 6 Mos ago and i think it
was $40 at the door and the turn out was pretty
good.

Also this isn't a major tour they aren't playing
anywhere else in the area. You will be lucky to
get in for $30 @ the door if you ask me.

We're thinking of going, however, there's no infoline on the ROM (it

Does anyone know where the party will be held? Also, would someone
please post the infoline?

I think he took a loan out on the catalog cause he needed some cash.

MJ rocks, one of the funckiest vocalists.  His moves are up there with the 
best too.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle}NOT Excited about cleveland


i've seen deep dish several times and the cost was only $10.  i've been to 
countless events with headliners like DD and it was usually around $10.  if 
you ever went to buzz on a regular night it was almost always $10, usually 
never more than $15 and you had deep dish in the main room, a room for dnb 
(usually) and the outside patio in the summer time.

why is it hard to believe that it could be only $10 bucks?  DD is far from 
as expensive as say sasha or digweed.

And I wouldn't have paid for that either. As I said, I've seen way
better acts for less money, and didn't have to see them in a club.

I won't be lucky to get in for $30. They would be lucky to get me in for
$20. :)

Subject: {pb-cle} moo moo!  (was Re: {pb-cle} Best Electronic Album Ever)

Best Electronic?  Well, well.  Hard to judge, so...here goes a long winded, 
perhaps anecdotal bag of e-music gushy gushy...

The original version of "What Time is Love" by KLF is an all time classic 
for you trance heads out there.  Don't go for the late 90's remakes with all 
the vocals...they got a bit dodgy there, but still entertaining with their 
115BPM/95BPM release sampling Monseiur Jackson.  There is an album of theirs 
that was released and IMMEDIATELY banned and recalled because of the 
shameless amount of sampling.  It was later re-released without the samples, 
just the music, and instructions on what samples went where and how so you 
could do it yourself ;)  I have only seen the album once, as it was a 
treasure of a long departed friend and DJ mentor...oh, yeah, the original 
3AM Eternal singles were spot on.

THE SHAMEN.  Too bad what happened, but the two albums "en:tact" and "boss 
drum" are nary to be forgotten, especially the limited edition R.Hawtin 
mixes off of the latter...sick, indeed!  "Pro:gen" is forever a classic, and 
Jack Danger's [Meat Beat] remix of "Hyperreal" is one of the sickest things 
to mix with another elec.classic "Helter Skelter" [Meat Beat.]  Not bad for 
starting out as a garage band ;)

As far as New Order's "Confusion" goes [to bring up a waaaay old post in 
this thread,] if you're talking the Advent Remix, then it's TECHNO.  The 
"Rest of New Order" remix is more proggy, but still tech.  My fave mixes are 
the '87 substance mix and THE original.  It's a toss up as to which N.O. 
album is best for me..."FAC51"..."Brotherhood"...and of course, the 
self-titled "New Order."  [As an aside, Joy Division was starting to bring 
in electronics before Ian Curtis' Atmosphere*ic departure from this earth.]

The original Cabaret Voltaire, OMD, and Section 25 on the Factory sampler 
and early releases...waaaaay back in 1980/81....were extraordinary markers 
for things to come.

Oooof.  F242.  Masterhit.  Anything before and including "Headhunter."

Section 25's only "hit" single...if you can name it, you get a prize ;)

For those francophiles, Signal Aout 42's "Submarine Dance."

For those anglophiles, Union Jack's "There will Be no Armageddon" is an 
album which stands waaaaay out there.

For those ameri-philes, "+8 Sampler."  4 Rec.Pack.  'nuff said.

Another best:  Jean Michelle Jarre's "Rendezvous," especially "Rendezvous 
IV"

People kill to get early copies of "No UFOs"

Satoshie Tomie's early house releases...

If you're into his/her/its wierdness...Walter/Wendy Carlos's albums 
involving classical and moogs were interesting.

Even wierder is Tomita doing classical with Casios, suspended over Tokyo 
harbour in a glass pyramid...what an album!

And speaking of Casios, everyone can't forget N-JOI and their love of that 
CZ101, berr waw waw waaa waaahhhh - "Mindflux."

OH yeah, Human Resource gets an honourable mention for the same thing, and 
kicking off a whole slew of hooooooovered out, filtered Casios and funny 
lyrics like, "I'm the one and only Dominator, wanna kiss myself..."

Herbie Hancock's "Headhunter" album should also be mentioned, though mostly 
accoustic instruments, he does some e-wikked stuff there.

Phillip Glass' "Music for Airports" will put you out.     there.        into 
some                  etherial     bliss                 or                  
                           was it?

Musn't forget 3 Phase's "Rota."

Musn't overlook Mike Oldfields "Songs of Distant Earth" album inspired by 
the short stories of Arthur C. Clarke.

If we move into another realm...Adam F's "Circles" is a pinnacle D&B 
classic.......SHEESH...now I have to step back and mention SL2, Two Blind 
Mice, 4 Hero...ALTERN8...

You know what?  I'll just stop here...there's a myriad number of thoughts 
going through my head as to "classic" or "best" electronic music 
albums...why choose?  Just enjoy...

...final thought, George Krantz.  "Din Daa Daa."

what does "what time is love?" have to do with trance? nothing, as 
far as i can tell. 

>If you're into his/her/its wierdness...Walter/Wendy Carlos's 
albums 
>involving classical and moogs were interesting.

i mentioned "sonic seasonings" but pretty much everything by 
him/her is the bomb. my personal favs are the "clockwork orange" 
theme and "the shining" theme (go ahead and try to find that one 
on vinyl : ) 

>Herbie Hancock's "Headhunter" album should also be mentioned, 
though mostly 
>accoustic instruments, he does some e-wikked stuff there.

headhunter is damn good. better synth stuff and breakbeats were 
on "thrust". the guy used the whole fucking ARP line on there. 

>Phillip Glass' "Music for Airports" will put you out.     
there.        into 
>some                  etherial     bliss

>                           was it?

it was brian eno who did "music for airports". i still like 
eno's "discreet music" better. BTW for the pgh heads, phillip 
glass and his orchestra are playing pgh the 25th and 26th of this 
month. of course i cant go. theyll be playing the scores from a 
couple films live along with the films. should be excellent, and 
its not too expensive. 

>Musn't overlook Mike Oldfields "Songs of Distant Earth" album 
inspired by 
>the short stories of Arthur C. Clarke.

"tubular bells" is probably the most classic LP by oldfield, like 
everyone i know owns it. 

>If we move into another realm...Adam F's "Circles" is a pinnacle 
D&B 
>classic.......SHEESH...now I have to step back and mention SL2, 
Two Blind 
>Mice, 4 Hero...ALTERN8...

eh, but none of those guys really dropped and great full albums. 4 
hero did, but not strictly jungle.

not too surprised @ those comments made by the moguls @
various record labels.

99% of radio stations don't feature enough music from
an LP for people to not want to go out there and pick a
copy of that LP up. if anything, people who do purchase
a copy of that LP always skip past the 
song(s) that most damn radio stations overkill.

i'm on the radio every week to play music, w/o
commercials, thats why public radio is great, then
again, i've yet to come across a public radio station
that airs "electronica" 24/7.

'til that day....

--0-1033470810-1033899265=:13819
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


the simple facts... 
A.  Average life of a club at its peak, 2 yrs, maybe 3 if it is promoted right.
B.  Moda spent over $1 million on this venue.  This will take at least 4 yrs. if not 5 to break even.
C.  Moda is paying retail for Dj's,  i. e.  Deep Dish
D.  To make this club work, they will have to pull from multiple major cities such as Detroit, Columbus, the arm "Pitt" of PA (sorry PA, I hate the Steelers), and maybe even Chicago or Cincinatti just to keep filled on a weekly basis and bring headliners in.
E.  Who is dumb enough to build a club in a city that can't afford to maintain a club such as Funky Buddah or Wish and when summer comes, where do you wanna be, on the patio at shooters or trapped inside at moda?
It breaks down to the facts, there are not enough club kids in cleveland to handle a club of this nature for 4 or 5 yrs.  
So I ask these questions:

well, if setting up a station didn't cost so much (purely because of

it's no wonder most stations are so commercialized.  power to public radio.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Club facts and M*da

Just for the fun of it, I am going to take the other side.   I don't think
anything like Moda has happened in this city for a very long time and I
would like to explain why.

<<<< the simple facts...
 A.  Average life of a club at its peak, 2 yrs, maybe 3 if it is promoted
right.>>>>

Except Cleveland.  Metropolis = 12 years, Spy = 6, Wish = 5, Beach Club =
15-20.  There are plenty more examples.


<<<< B.  Moda spent over $1 million on this venue.  This will take at least
4 yrs. if not 5 to break even.>>>>>

no arguement here, except moda will be able to get a big chunk of change
when they go to sell the club.  some rich person with $$$ is sure to want to
stroke their ego.


<<<< C.  Moda is paying retail for Dj's,  i. e.  Deep Dish >>>>

are they?   evan glassman is their talent buyer and he has done some very
big shows, so i'm sure he is getting a break.  additionally i think this
nexio? sound system is a big deal and certain acts will accept less loot to
play on it.

<<<< D.  To make this club work, they will have to pull from multiple major
cities such as Detroit, Columbus, the arm "Pitt" of PA (sorry PA, I hate the
Steelers), and maybe even Chicago or Cincinatti just to keep filled on a
weekly basis and bring headliners in.>>>>

true enough.   i think they are making a big mistake by bringing in outside
talent on opening weekend, but that is only my opinion.  i understand that
they want to open with a bang and bring national talkent once a month.  i've
never been able to follow and example like this, so it will be something
cool to watch.


<<<<< E.  Who is dumb enough to build a club in a city that can't afford to
maintain a club such as Funky Buddah or Wish and when summer comes, where do
you wanna be, on the patio at shooters or trapped inside at moda?>>>>>>

These are BAD examples.   Wish, from day one, was not righ.  It was Terry
Barbu's first club design and he made many mistakes -- traffic flow in this
club was horrible and it is not a comfortable space.  They didn't do well
from DAY ONE and all the controversy that went on when Terry left made it
difficult to do better.   Funky Buddah is an upscale Top40 club, which I
still am puzzled over.  WHy do you open a club as cool as that, and serve
top40.  Really, there is an overabundance of that in this town and we don't
need any more.   Groovee "was what it was".  Low overhead, and it had a 2.5
year run.  It failure was due to several reasons.  It was run down. It was
based on trendy-trendy and its only identity was the tight shirt muscle
heads who attended .   It had its time of coolness and fridays were very
fun.   When funky buddah opened, my night was strongly rooted in hard house
and was still fairly successful -- but still had all the trendoids in it who
had to go check out buddah when it opened.   The owners paniced because I
was more underground than Robin and they thought that I needed to cheese up.
As soon as I accomodated, we lost the core crowd.   Eventually as hard house
went by the wayside, I tried to move them into the prog sound and they were
not having any of that and tied my hands even further.  Finally there was no
crowd left and it was over.   As for the shooters patio phenomenon...
well... again I can say that if you cater to "trendy trendy" you will have
the problem, but if moda has a core crowd devoted to the music they won't
loose it all during the summer.


<<<<< It breaks down to the facts, there are not enough club kids in
cleveland to handle a club of this nature for 4 or 5 yrs.  >>>>>

This is something we will find out about.  There hasn't been much offered in
the true club experience the last few years.   Small 200-500 person venues
and no identity.  The economy sucks and techno is not longer cool for many
people, so things COULD get interesting.



<<<<< So I ask these questions:
 Is it good business sense to open a club of this nature? >>>>>>

We'll find out.  Moda is certainly doing things the right way and by the
book.  Again, I stress that we have not had true professionals design a club
in Cleveland since Metropolis first opened over a decade ago... I think an
outside perspective might be just what we need to wake everything up.


<<<<< Headliners come to Cleveland and don't care to throw down, especialy
at clubs, will it be any different here?    (parties i beg to differ, but
clubs, I have yet to see it in the past 3 yrs)>>>>>

What are you talking about?   There are plenty of headliners who come to
town and throw down... and provide a kick ass party to packed houses.   Then
again, there are some things that really do suck.  The whole theory of
bringing outside entertainment really got lost the past few years - I don't
want to go into this fully, but to make it short a club should be booking
talent that solidifies the postion of their resident dj.

<<<<< I go out to see my boys spin. On the rare opportunity of seeing a
major headliner, it better be someone special before I go see them.  Who
would I rather support, my friends or some club, I choose to spend my entry
fee on those who support me, not some meat market.  I tend to believe that
the majority of us have seen and experienced about all we can and Moda will
not show us anything truely unique or original, which, with the hype, is
just another disappointment about where we are headed  >>>>>

I see part of your point here.  I don't think Moda is going to be your
typical college/top40/pickup bar. Mainstream attracts those types of people,
and that scene just doesn't happen too much around unfamiliar music.   I
think Moda brings several fresh things to the table:  A new space designed
by people outside of Cleveland -- so it will be unique to the locals;
some of the best sound in the world;   Top notch effects;   A style of
music, prog, that is not getting playing in the clubs; and something NEW.
When you are speaking of "truely unique or original" I am not sure what you
mean.  If you want something that musically pushes the boundaries, you need
something small and cheap -- really -- creative types don't have a lot of
money.

<<<< ...Although this is just my opinion, I could be wrong
 On the other hand, it is only $10 for DD, I might just attend to take part
in the meat market of the Cleveland Club.>>>>

I'm going to add several opinions on the cover charge thing. A) Metropolis
charges $10 cover -- if people accept this then i see no problem with paying
$20 to hear Moda's resident and $30-40 for a guest.  Before Filly, Ian, and
I left M in may -- we asked for a cover reduction every week but were not
granted it.  B)  I don't have a problem with paying a $10 cover @ moda as
long as the club (sound, lights, staff) is TOP NOTCH and I have no problems
paying an additional $5-15 for a guest dj (Depending on who it is).  Chances
are that if a dj is going to cost more than an extra $5 then I'm not going
to care about them.   Really... i prefer the New York way of doing things:
People with a clue pay a reduced cover or get in free -- while morons pay
$25+ to get in.

One other thought on the subject of cover charges now verses years ago...
drug use.  Tweakers tend to drink more but everyone else other drug users
don't drink at all.  5 years ago there were less people who knew about
rolls, etc:  so a $5 cover was adequate.  If you put a percentage on the
number of people not drinking now vs 5 years ago then you should expect
cover charges to increase by at least the same percentage.  Maybe a $50
cover charge and free drinks...  but that is illegal in Ohio.

Moda "is what it is" and for some ravers, it should be a step into the club
scene.  For some clubbers -- it will be a new experience.  I don't
understand why everyone feels the need to dog it before it even opens.  WHY?
Don't you want something better for this town?   EXPECIALLY... when half of
cleveland is going to chastise it for being "too underground" and "cleveland
can't support this" the people who are part of the underground are saying
"its too mainstream, its a pickup bar".  When is this going to stop?
Personally, I don't think anyone who DOESN'T go out to the clubs at least
once or twice a month should be allowed to have an opinion -- your jaded
responses only bring down the potential of what things could become.  If you
like something -- support it.  Don't dog something you haven't even
experienced yet -- that's just being a hater.  The world is full of them and
REALLY... the underground is supposed to be about escaping them.

this is "1987".   they released it and were to destroy them due the the
copyright violations.  they took them out to a field in the country and
burned them.  some got out.  i've seen copies upwards of 500$.  there are

On point 1, I'm sure they will not devote their life and money on 
the electronic scene...... in other words, i'm sure they'll have their
share of cheese fest and frat fests if they want to survive... maybe
even hip hop nights....  THAT is how a club makes their money.

Ravers forget that no one makes money off of them b-c 
a) they don't drink much and b) they don't tip well
so a club that has an EDM night usually does it to 
be nice and/or cool.... money is made off of frat boys
and hip hop heads....... So if they're smart, they'll have
a game plan like this.  That and they may open things
up to record labels for the place to be the 'official after hours'
of certain entertainer's concerts.... that's another big money
maker.

On point 2, I bet 85% of the DJs would PREFER to play a club
over a rave due to the often correct perception that clubs are more
secured and less likely to be busted.  If this club comes correct
and is run by people who have decent common sense then you'll
start seeing a shift in Dj attitudes in your area abuot playing clubs
up there.

Oh, and $1 million for a club is nothing extraordinairy and is
fairly standard in the industry.

There's a club that opened here in Indianoplace (indianapolis) 
and they spent 1.5 million and it's nothing special.... infact,
in the past 2 years, there have been 3 clubs that have opened
up with 1million-dollar price tag over it's head.

Do not get me wrong, I think I will last for quite some time and I do see where it is unique and different, but we do not have the crowd to push it in my opinion.  I think it will be a nice change and I will go check it out, much like everyone else.  I have to wonder as to the pheasability of it having enough revenue to continue at a pace at which it will be worth the $$$ spent.  I think it is a step in the right direction for the Cleveland club scene, but will it be worth it, I just dont see it, especialy paying retail for big names.  

Just for the fun of it, I am going to take the other side. I don't think
anything like Moda has happened in this city for a very long time and I
would like to explain why.

<<<< the simple facts...
A. Average life of a club at its peak, 2 yrs, maybe 3 if it is promoted
right.>>>>

Except Cleveland. Metropolis = 12 years, Spy = 6, Wish = 5, Beach Club =
15-20. There are plenty more examples.


<<<< B. Moda spent over $1 million on this venue. This will take at least
4 yrs. if not 5 to break even.>>>>>

no arguement here, except moda will be able to get a big chunk of change
when they go to sell the club. some rich person with $$$ is sure to want to
stroke their ego.


<<<< C. Moda is paying retail for Dj's, i. e. Deep Dish >>>>

are they? evan glassman is their talent buyer and he has done some very
big shows, so i'm sure he is getting a break. additionally i think this
nexio? sound system is a big deal and certain acts will accept less loot to
play on it.

<<<< D. To make this club work, they will have to pull from multiple major
cities such as Detroit, Columbus, the arm "Pitt" of PA (sorry PA, I hate the
Steelers), and maybe even Chicago or Cincinatti just to keep filled on a
weekly basis and bring headliners in.>>>>

true enough. i think they are making a big mistake by bringing in outside
talent on opening weekend, but that is only my opinion. i understand that
they want to open with a bang and bring national talkent once a month. i've
never been able to follow and example like this, so it will be something
cool to watch.


<<<<< E. Who is dumb enough to build a club in a city that can't afford to
maintain a club such as Funky Buddah or Wish and when summer comes, where do
you wanna be, on the patio at shooters or trapped inside at moda?>>>>>>

These are BAD examples. Wish, from day one, was not righ. It was Terry
Barbu's first club design and he made many mistakes -- traffic flow in this
club was horrible and it is not a comfortable space. They didn't do well
from DAY ONE and all the controversy that went on when Terry left made it
difficult to do better. Funky Buddah is an upscale Top40 club, which I
still am puzzled over. WHy do you open a club as cool as that, and serve
top40. Really, there is an overabundance of that in this town and we don't
need any more. Groovee "was what it was". Low overhead, and it had a 2.5
year run. It failure was due to several reasons. It was run down. It was
based on trendy-trendy and its only identity was the tight shirt muscle
heads who attended . It had its time of coolness and fridays were very
fun. When funky buddah opened, my night was strongly rooted in hard house
and was still fairly successful -- but still had all the trendoids in it who
had to go check out buddah when it opened. The owners paniced because I
was more underground than Robin and they thought that I needed to cheese up.
As soon as I accomodated, we lost the core crowd. Eventually as hard house
went by the wayside, I tried to move them into the prog sound and they were
not having any of that and tied my hands even further. Finally there was no
crowd left and it was over. As for the shooters patio phenomenon...
well... again I can say that if you cater to "trendy trendy" you will have
the problem, but if moda has a core crowd devoted to the music they won't
loose it all during the summer.


<<<<< It breaks down to the facts, there are not enough club kids in
cleveland to handle a club of this nature for 4 or 5 yrs. >>>>>

This is something we will find out about. There hasn't been much offered in
the true club experience the last few years. Small 200-500 person venues
and no identity. The economy sucks and techno is not longer cool for many
people, so things COULD get interesting.



<<<<< So I ask these questions:
Is it good business sense to open a club of this nature? >>>>>>

We'll find out. Moda is certainly doing things the right way and by the
book. Again, I stress that we have not had true professionals design a club
in Cleveland since Metropolis first opened over a decade ago... I think an
outside perspective might be just what we need to wake everything up.


<<<<< Headliners come to Cleveland and don't care to throw down, especialy
at clubs, will it be any different here? (parties i beg to differ, but
clubs, I have yet to see it in the past 3 yrs)>>>>>

What are you talking about? There are plenty of headliners who come to
town and throw down... and provide a kick ass party to packed houses. Then
again, there are some things that really do suck. The whole theory of
bringing outside entertainment really got lost the past few years - I don't
want to go into this fully, but to make it short a club should be booking
talent that solidifies the postion of their resident dj.

<<<<< I go out to see my boys spin. On the rare opportunity of seeing a
major headliner, it better be someone special before I go see them. Who
would I rather support, my friends or some club, I choose to spend my entry
fee on those who support me, not some meat market. I tend to believe that
the majority of us have seen and experienced about all we can and Moda will
not show us anything truely unique or original, which, with the hype, is
just another disappointment about where we are headed >>>>>

I see part of your point here. I don't think Moda is going to be your
typical college/top40/pickup bar. Mainstream attracts those types of people,
and that scene just doesn't happen too much around unfamiliar music. I
think Moda brings several fresh things to the table: A new space designed
by people outside of Cleveland -- so it will be unique to the locals;
some of the best sound in the world; Top notch effects; A style of
music, prog, that is not getting playing in the clubs; and something NEW.
When you are speaking of "truely unique or original" I am not sure what you
mean. If you want something that musically pushes the boundaries, you need
something small and cheap -- really -- creative types don't have a lot of
money.

<<<< ...Although this is just my opinion, I could be wrong
On the other hand, it is only $10 for DD, I might just attend to take part
in the meat market of the Cleveland Club.>>>>

I'm going to add several opinions on the cover charge thing. A) Metropolis
charges $10 cover -- if people accept this then i see no problem with paying
$20 to hear Moda's resident and $30-40 for a guest. Before Filly, Ian, and
I left M in may -- we asked for a cover reduction every week but were not
granted it. B) I don't have a problem with paying a $10 cover @ moda as
long as the club (sound, lights, staff) is TOP NOTCH and I have no problems
paying an additional $5-15 for a guest dj (Depending on who it is). Chances
are that if a dj is going to cost more than an extra $5 then I'm not going
to care about them. Really... i prefer the New York way of doing things:
People with a clue pay a reduced cover or get in free -- while morons pay
$25+ to get in.

One other thought on the subject of cover charges now verses years ago...
drug use. Tweakers tend to drink more but everyone else other drug users
don't drink at all. 5 years ago there were less people who knew about
rolls, etc: so a $5 cover was adequate. If you put a percentage on the
number of people not drinking now vs 5 years ago then you should expect
cover charges to increase by at least the same percentage. Maybe a $50
cover charge and free drinks... but that is illegal in Ohio.

Moda "is what it is" and for some ravers, it should be a step into the club
scene. For some clubbers -- it will be a new experience. I don't
understand why everyone feels the need to dog it before it even opens. WHY?
Don't you want something better for this town? EXPECIALLY... when half of
cleveland is going to chastise it for being "too underground" and "cleveland
can't support this" the people who are part of the underground are saying
"its too mainstream, its a pickup bar". When is this going to stop?
Personally, I don't think anyone who DOESN'T go out to the clubs at least
once or twice a month should be allowed to have an opinion -- your jaded
responses only bring down the potential of what things could become. If you
like something -- support it. Don't dog something you haven't even
experienced yet -- that's just being a hater. The world is full of them and
REALLY... the underground is supposed to be about escaping them.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ JAZZY JEFF this week @ Groove!!

he just released an album that is more of the house/r&b vibe.  my girlfriend
saw him in miami this past spring at a broken beat party with bugs in the
attic, dego, etc.  she said he was really good.

'who is that playing right now?'
'jazzy jeff'
'no really, who is that?  he's really good'
'jazzy jeff'

It is what i would be saying if he were still here.  It's been over a year,
but it seems like yesterday that he was around bullshitting with us.  This
one goes out to Ryan Bambao, who would have been 25 today.

Subject: {pb-cle} new DNB mix up - "changing seasons" - mp3/realaudio


Hey everyone, I put up a new mix "changing seasons" on my site:

   http://ratana.chemlab.org

27(!) tunes, 80 minutes, some of the stuff I've really been feeling lately
on a smoother tip.  I IMPLORE everyone who has been trashing drum n bass
to check this out, I feel it is chock full of great tunes that hopefully
will help you think different.  Alot of melodies, synths, SOUL, and warm
vibes.

This has some of my favorite tunes to come out this year: Mathematics -
Jersey Deep, a great track by guys from NYC, F8 - Skyrise Tracing a real
epic atmospheric jam with an amen that comes in -- and works!, and
Dragonsword - Silent Fury (along with the flip, Uridium), hands down my
favorite release this year on the atmpospheric tip - synthy, melodic,
epic, and dancefloor friendly!

It's not perfect, there are 2 mixes in particular i'm really not happy
about, but I'm not gonna redo this one.. done in one take on Saturday
morning.

Let me know what you think!!

Tracklist:

01. Pieter K - Trefusis Point (remix) - Breakbeat Science
02. Aquasky feat. Billie Godfrey - Give Me Life - Aspect
03. Klute - Part of Me - Hospital
04. Chris SU - Airlift (Mathematics Lifted remix) - Music Forever
05. 60 Minute Man + DJ Touch - Alright - Intercom

Yeah, they sold less than 200 tickets, so they postponed it. 
Probably because no one knew it was going on until last week or so.

Its gonna be rescheduled for some time in November.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} new DNB mix up - "changing seasons" - mp3/realaudio

nice.  One thing I love about Dn'B is that I have no desire to spin it or
produce it.  I can accept it as a normal consumer would.  I thought the
track selection had a nice progression and the mixing was very clean.  I
love the intelligent, atmospheric, almost housey at times sound.  Worth the
download for sure.

ah Bah Humbug (a few months early)...

Plum cops suck, and it reminds me of tha setting of a cheesy teen movie... anyone who went to Plum Senior High HAS to agree with that lol...

Penn Hills isnt so bad... I suppose if youre scared of black ppl or white ppl pretending to be black it would be slightly alarming... wait, nah... go thru Homewood and then complain.

Penn Hills rocks.

YoOoOoo pb-cle-ravers....

This a friendly invitation on behalf of Reflective.net to checkout the brand
spankin' new Reflective forums, with discussions already in progress. The
boards are about 3 days old and have 126 members and counting, from
different parts of the world. You'll find topics about EDM, dancing (Liquid
Pop forums), media, art, modern culture, news, reviews, events, poetry and
creative writing (Wordplay forum), and we'll be adding 'Classifieds' and 'DJ
Diary' forums by the end of the week. We host an intellectual-friendly
environment, encourage healthy debate, but still keep it fun.

have a visit... http://reflective.net/forums

here's a few sample threads currently up, you can jump right in:

About the "DJ Diary" forums: these exclusive journals will be maintained at
least twice a week by a limited amount of well-known DJs. The DJs will be
the only ones allowed to start a topic in their forum, but everyone can
reply. And the DJ who's forum it is has full moderator abilities. That's the
concept. If you would like to apply to have a forum on the boards, please
email me a detailed DJ bio, and any links to online mixes would be great.
Prerequisites are a somewhat active DJing schedule, minimal writing
experience, and responsibility enough to post at least twice a week.

serious inquiries only: imri@reflective.net

Subject: {pb-cle} London Tips anyone?

I'm going to London for a long weekend Oct 31-Nov 4, and have never been
(actually, never been out of USA 'cept for Canada...).

Staying at a hotel at Trafalgar Square which I'm told is right near
Buckingham Palace and such...

Anyone have any ideas of "must see's" while I'm there...any specific
clubs...I know of so many, and of course now that I'm actually going, can't
recall the list....I'll dig out some of my old Muzik Mags and se, but was
looking for any first-hand accounts.

Thanks for any tips you may have....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} London Tips anyone?

Check out "The End"  That was my favorite club over there.  The DJ booth is 
in the center of the dance floor so there's a crowd 360 degrees around it.  
I'm not sure if it's still going on, but the night I went to (Fri. or 
Saturday) Mr. C of the Shaman and Layo and Bushwacka were the residents.  
Stacey Pullen, Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva were the guests (John's set 
is on my all-time fav's list).  I believe they have comparable guests all 
the time.  I also went to Digweed's night at Heaven, but I left totally 
unimpressed.
Hope that helps.

Peace,
Darren

***Stop the House RAVE Act***



Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) has introduced a House version of the RAVE
Act. It

Is almost exactly the same as the Senate version. The House Judiciary

Committee will most likely be voting on the bill NEXT WEEK (the week
of the

7th). If it passes out of Committee as is, the RAVE Act could become
law

THIS YEAR, which means federal prosecutors will have the power they
need to

shut down raves, hemp festivals, hip hop concerts, and other events
they

don't like.



We are asking voters to call their Representative to stop the RAVE
Act.



What to Do:



1) Please forward this e-mail to your friends, family, and
co-workers.



2) Find out if your Representative is on the House Judiciary Committee
by

going to:

<http://www.house.gov/judiciary/members.htm>.

Not sure who your Representative is?

Find out at: <http://www.house.gov/writerep/>.



3) If your Representative is on the House Judiciary Committee call
them on

Monday, October 7th and tell them to VOTE AGAINST THE RAVE ACT.

THE RAVE ACT IS A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH, FREE SPEECH, AND INNOCENT

BUSINESS OWNERS. You can contact your Representative by calling the
Capitol

Switchboard at 202-224-3121.



4) If you haven't faxed your Senators about the RAVE Act, please do so
by

going to:

<http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=3D2&item=3D1287=
>

PLEASE COPY AND FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN!
Also, print up copies and post them at work, on bulletin boards, and 
even hand them out.


You know what they say about frogs and pots of water...

...Well, the frog is boiling to death already!!!



Just when we all thought we were making headway against the Senate's 
RAVE ACT, the house introduced their OWN version of this 
unconstitutional act!

The title of H5519:

Title: To prohibit an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining, 
managing, controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or 
profiting from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, 
distributing, or using any controlled substance, and for other 
purposes.

And for other purpose. AND FOR OTHER PURPOSE?!?! That opens it up to 
everything!

This bill is targeted at our right to peaceably assemble and listen 
to music. Concerts, Jazz festivals, dance clubs,  even private 
parties IN YOUR HOME and ANY other assembly can be interdicted upon 
by law enforcement with only suspicion and innuendo and no evidence! 
We must all write and CALL our congressmen to tell them to vote NO on 
this Nazi-esque bill!

Time is of the essence! This bill is going before committee TOMORROW 
(Thursday the 10th) at 11 AM eastern time. (see link below to listen 
to it live!)

HOW YOU CAN TAKE ACTION RIGHT NOW!!!

SUBCOMMITTEE INFORMATION:
~Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security
11:00 p.m. in 2237 Rayburn House Office Building
Legislative Hearing on H.R. 5519, the "Reducing Americans 
Vulnerability to Ecstacy Act of 2002." Markup immediately following

---------      SAMPLE LETTER ------------------:

Here's a sample letter just cut and paste and email it to your congressman at
http://www.congress.org
It's also a good idea to print it out, sign it, and mail to your 
congressman directly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO: Representative <NAME>
FROM: <YOUR NAME AND STREET ADDRESS>

RE: VOTE NO on HR5519 (RAVE ACT)


Dear Representative <NAME>

I strongly urge you to vote NO on HR5519, the so called "Reducing 
American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act".

This bill is a broadly worded attack on our constitutionally 
protected freedoms. Stop it now before it goes any further. While 
recreational substance use may be an issue, this is not an 
appropriate way to deal with it.

First, this bill is a direct attack on our freedom to assemble 
peaceably - a right protected by the constitution.

Second, this bill is so broadly worded it can be misused by law 
enforcement to interdict ANY group or assembly as they see fit with 
nothing more than suspicion and innuendo. It will no doubt be used by 
law enforcement to attack minorities and any other peaceful assembly 
that law enforcement determines without due process.

Third, It is reminiscent of the kind of broad anti-free-speech laws 
that were passed under the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany in the 
late 30's. WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR FREE NATION TO BE RUINED WITH LAWS 
LIKE THIS.

Fourth, this bill only serves to further the hysteria and 
misinformation surrounding the "drug war". What our children need is 
education and real, honest information regarding recreational 
substances and their issues. What our children DON'T need are more 
un-American laws tearing our society apart.

I reiterate: please vote NO on HR5519. It is not anti-drug - it is 
anti-American!



Kindest Regards,



<SIGN YOUR NAME>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Have you written your senator regarding the senate version of this 
bill? if not, you could use this same sample letter, but replace 
"HR5519" with "S2633". You can also find your senators at

Mail it today!

Thanks for taking action - if we speak together with one voice, we 
WILL be heard!

Thank You, Scott Henry, John Tab, Amanda Huie and Buzz Crew, past and
present, for envisioning Buzz and being there for us for 9 incredible y=

(7 for me, personally).  Buzz changed my life, improved the quality of =
my
life, made me glad to be alive.  I could never adequately express how
special Buzz's existence was to me, or how much it meant to me.

My Buddhist mentor has said, in difficult times, that the darker the ni=

BUZZ 1993-2002
#1 MEGA-CLUB IN AMERICA
(URB MAGAZINE 1998-2001)

When it's time for "That '90s Show," it will be about Buzz kidz. Since
1993, if you were young at heart, fun-loving, adventurous and if your r=
adar
was tuned to cutting edge culture, you found Buzz. Buzz offered world c=
lass
DJ's and other EDM stars and solid up and coming DJ's playing the world=
's
greatest dance music, state of the art lighting displays (big up, John
Niederhauser), and thousands of other friendly, diverse, openminded
dreamers who converged on its dance floors from every part of greater D=
C
and from as far away as New York, the Carolinas and New Orleans. Friday=

after Friday, Buzz served up memories of a lifetime with amazing theme
nights and holiday extravaganzas including bubbly Ibiza foam fests in t=
he
courtyard, Mardi Gras parties with actors and acrobats, rollicking New
Year's Eve's with champagne toasts and party favors, White and Red and
Anime parties, and Halloween's with Frankenstein and Blair Witch stage
sets. Nobody did it better or cared more for its patrons than the Buzz
Crew.
On September 18, following a military ban of Nation for service members=
,
and an undercover sting by DC police resulting in the arrests outside o=
f
Nation of eight people charged with selling drugs and the threat of the=

loss of Nation's liquor license, Buzzlife Productions announced it woul=
d
end Buzz rather than to allow Buzz to become a "scapegoat" for the
country's war on drugs and thereby "tarnish all electronic dance music
events."
We who loved Buzz mourn its loss and will continue fighting with you,
Buzzlife, against bills such as S. 2633, the RAVE Act (from which Senat=
ors
Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin have reportedly withdrawn their support),=
 and
against unfair treatment by government and media. Please accept these w=
ords
of deepest love, support and appreciation from representatives of your
local and global electronic dance music scenes which you've played such=
 a
huge role in building. BUZZ will shine brilliantly in music history
forever! Respect!

"I can't believe that in these times of stress and fear, that our own
government would expend time, manpower and money applying pressure to t=
he
owner of Nation to shut down Buzz, the largest and best run club in the=

country. I have been DJ'ing for 18 years and this is a truly sad day fo=
r me
and all of us in the scene."
DB, Breakbeat Science, N.A.S.A., New York

"I have been going to Buzz since its inception nine years ago, and I ha=
ve
known Scott Henry, John Tab, and let's not forget Lieven DeGeynt, for e=
ven
longer than that. I grew up with these guys in this business. I know a =
lot
of people in this industry and, in general, I do not call many of them
friends. But I am proud to say that these guys are my friends. While th=
e
club world is full of slimy and untrustworthy souls, it is sad, if not
ironic, to see some of the nicest, most real guys I know forced out of =
the
scene. The closing of the country's best event of its kind is a shame, =
one
that leaves me at a loss for words to truly describe the consequences t=
his
loss will surely have on the club scene in DC, and the US. I hope the c=
ity
knows and appreciates what, and who, it has lost."
Ed Bailey, velvetnation

"After six-plus years of promoting my own events, I understand exactly =
how
motivated, professional and just plain good at what they do the Buzzlif=
e
crew have been to keep such a large event running smoothly for all thes=
e
years. The ego and quirks of DJ's, the often unrealistic expectations o=
f
patrons, and the highly random nature of a couple thousand people in on=
e
place partying their asses off, can all trip up a team who take their j=
obs
too lightly, but to the outside observer, the Buzz crew made it look
effortless."
Tony Tribby, 2501, Alchemy

"On behalf of the Sonic Soul crew, I would like to genuinely thank Scot=
t
Henry and Buzz for providing us with some of our favorite DJ moments. T=
hey
looked to us in helping with bookings for the deck, Supersting, and the=

tent New Year's Eve 1999; the Buzz crew was always open to us bringing =
new
and diverse talent from left of the dance floor center. We appreciate t=
hat.
Their open-minded music policy and acceptance is uncommon among
super-clubs. It was indeed one of their strengths. Buzz made DC's night=
life
the envy of the entire nation. They will be missed. Best of luck in the=

future."
DJ LoveGrove, Sonic Soul Productions, Sonar, Baltimore

"Hello, Kevin Bacon, errr, Charles Feelgood here, just lettin' the DC p=
eeps
know that I'll miss partying with them on Friday nights at Buzz. Those =
daze
will never be forgotten. And don't let the DC government take all of yo=
ur
dance spots away. Protest!"
Charles Feelgood, Moonshine, Los Angeles

"I was deeply saddened when I was told the news that Buzz was to close =
its
doors. The more I thought about it the more I realized just how much of=
 a
blow it is not just to the local dance scene in Washington but to the
entire North American dance music movement. Buzz is a club that will be=

remembered by all who worked and played there with the fondest memories=
. I
feel proud to have been part of the Buzz family and proud to watch it g=
row
in stature to what can only be described as one of North America's prem=
iere
venues showcasing talent from every corner of the globe. It is a shame =
that
Buzz has fallen victim to blind bureaucracy and it is a shame that a pi=
ece
of American dance culture has been taken from all of us. So long,
farewell."
Dave Ralph, Kinetic Records, UK

"Buzz was one of the most professionally run, LEGITIMATE clubs that I'v=
e
ever had the pleasure of working with. It is very saddening that the
government has decided to target Buzz for drug problems that are preval=
ent
in almost every sector of our society. This heavy-handed excuse for
'progress' in America's never-to-be-won drug war has succeeded only in
eliminating one of Washington, DC's most vibrant entertainment business=
es
and all the jobs that went along with it. Everyone in this scene needs =
to
stand together politically in order to prevent further closures from
happening in the rest of the country."
Dieselboy aka Damian Higgins, HUMAN, System Recordings, Planet of the
Drums, Philadelphia

"Scott and John, without you and what you guys have done, I would not h=
ave
a purpose in my life and be doing what I have been doing for the past n=
ine
years. What you have given me and my crew is priceless and I can never
thank you enough for everything. Your parties and your continued suppor=
t of
this scene that we all love will always be the benchmark that we all st=
rive
for."
Sinestro aka Chris Baggett, KINGSIZE-USA, The Syndicate, BuzzDC

"Buzz has been a staple of our scene for almost a decade. Well-establis=
hed
musicians from all reaches of the globe found an ecstatic audience of
dedicated fans from all along the east coast, local DJ's found support =
and
exposure, and we found a community based on the music we love. The loca=
l
rave scene evolved into an established culture where Buzz provided high=

quality entertainment in a legal, safe environment. This was not a have=
n
for illicit activity. This was a safe place for thousands to enjoy danc=
ing
to music they love. Undue pressure based on nominal incidents has robbe=
d DC
of its place on the map as one of the largest dance music scenes. The
culture will grow, the music will continue, but the youth of DC have lo=
st
something great."
Melzie, List Administrator, DCRaves

"I will truly miss Buzz. I have been going there the past five years an=
d it
has given me some of my greatest memories. It was always a place I coul=
d go
to enjoy the music I love and see wonderful friends. Thanks to Scott He=
nry,
John Tab and the rest of the Buzz Crew for doing such a wonderful job! =
I
will definitely be looking forward to what you have in store for us nex=
t."
Emily Dye, West River, Maryland

"To me, Buzz represented freedom, humanity, energy, bliss, music,
creativity, and dance, all in one place. Buzz helped me live out my dre=
ams
by opening the door to a whole new world of music and friends that have=

since become my life's work. It will be sorely missed."
Juliette Siegfried aka Zelda, Metatrack Studios

"Buzz, Sting, Buzz. It was so nice to see its original name come back. =
My
husband and I were upset to hear about Buzz's closing. DC won't ever be=
 the
same again. We didn't appreciate Buzz until we had the chance to experi=
ence
other clubs around the world. Then we realized how fortunate we already=

were. We thank you, Buzz, for bringing in the top notch talent to our
hometown and for creating a venue so awesome. We will always remember t=
he
best times we had there and will really miss you."
Sonal and Umit Shah

"Thanks for five years of good times and great tunes. We'll miss you. T=
he
glass is never half empty. Much love and respect."
Aubrey Torres, Leesburg, Virginia

Electronic dance music is my passion. I often wonder if those who choos=
e to
break us down know what it's like to have something they are passionate=

about taken away from them. I think most outside the EDM world assume w=
e
are lost souls. Perhaps if they considered their passions, they would o=
pen
their ears, eyes and minds to the absolute reality of EDM for the major=
ity
of us. I AM EDM. I refuse to give up my passion. See you again soon, Bu=
zz."
Jen "the politics of dancing, the politics of ooo feeling good" in NC

"Thanks, Buzz, for showing me who Derrick Carter is! I wouldn't be DJ'i=
ng
if it wasn't for that night."
Apple aka Courtney Reyers, Publisher, Innerloop Magazine, Metatrack
Studios, Odds and Ends Music, Chocolate Music

"Thanks for the great times and great music. I will miss Buzz Fridays b=
ut I
am looking forward to your future events. I know they will be phat."
K-Yun, Inthemix1

Buzz-goers since its beginning at the Eastside Club. I think the origin=

g.
We have so many memories: "Big Top Parties" under the tent behind Track=
s,
Buzz at the Capitol Ballroom, back when the DJ booth was just balancing=

a stack of cinderblocks and bike racks! Buzz truly evolved into the
much-deserved #1 Dance Party in America. There is no doubt that without=

we all must come together and support them in this low time. Good job,
guys! We will miss you, until you rise again.

"Much respect to everyone at Buzz. They gave many people in the DC area=

their first taste of electronic music, including myself. The party was
something we all looked forward to and will be greatly missed. Good luc=

Nooch aka Jason Plank, Stereo

"We are extremely displeased and upset to see what was a milestone for
electronic music to have shut its doors after so many years. We will ca=

with us many memories of past events, performances, and our own DJ sets=
 at
what was considered by many to be the best weekly event in America. Tha=
nks
to Scott and John, DC was able to witness the world's leading producers=
 and
DJ's and was put on the map of the electronic circuit as a city one mus=

Edan, DJ Hope, Carlo ? 4twenty4 Productions, DC

"The impact of Buzz closing has dampened the spirits of electronic musi=

fans and artists across the board. I have always felt privileged to liv=

the DC area, having weekly access to such a good crowd and great music.=
 I
still hope for the best and know that Buzzlife will continue to stand u=

love and respect to all those in support at this time of change."
Jen Lasher, OOBliss, Release, DC

"The Evolve Crew thanks Buzz for nine wonderful years of amazing events=

You are the originators and have played a crucial role in the birth of =
the
US electronic music scene. Your presence in this city will be deeply
missed."
Evolve Crew, DC

"For seven years I've known the intriguing people behind Buzz. I can't =
even
really express what these people have meant to me, Sarah S., Scott, Joh=
n
and a recent addition who has been like the capping of one of the best
production crews I've experienced. My hat goes off to you all. My hand
extends with continued support and my heart goes out to you. I feel as =

Mark G, LuvChild Entertainment, Instinctive Grooves

"The DJ's Buzz brought to DC were astounding, not to be matched in this=

area. I have many friends I met at Buzz for the first time. Buzz will t=

Camille Sevigny aka Dee Jay Clutch, IntheMix

"Buzz Crew, thanks for all the great memories and support! Best of luck=

all your future endeavors! You will be missed!"
Oron Haus and EastCoastHappy.com Staff

"Buzz closing is a bad omen for the current state of dance music cultur=
e in
America. Buzz has been a cornerstone of the US touring circuit for nati=
onal
and international electronic music artists and DJ's. It's always been o=
ne
of the most professionally run and state of the art venues in the world=
 to
present the music in. The authorities have taken no time to see this. I=
t's
discriminatory, since the issues that they claim Buzz has, affects all
music venues and events everywhere. Hopefully the groundswell that danc=
e
music culture has with its loyal fans will move beyond this."
Steve Levy, President, Moonshine Music

"So sad. It was such a professional venue and night. Scott worked so ha=
rd.
Thanks for giving us the great times. We love you. Are we still living =
in
America?"
Uberzone, Moonshine

"Buzz's closure is an embarrassment on an international level. The curr=
ent
government and its agencies have chosen to focus on restricting young
people's civil liberties, as well as usurping the nightclub entertainme=
nt
industry's right to run legitimate businesses. This unconstitutional ty=
pe
of government intervention is practically unheard of in other parts of =
the
world and is a scandal in a country which prides itself on protecting t=
he
civil liberties of its citizens. At a time when most of America is focu=
sed
on homeland security, our government has chosen to preoccupy itself wit=
h a
fanatical obsession with glowsticks and pacifiers, one which has been
repeatedly rejected by the courts and fought by civil liberties groups.=
 As
difficult and frustrating as this situation is, we must try and concent=
rate
on the positive side. Buzz was an internationally recognized club that
continued to grow in popularity. It attracted the best national and
international talent, as well as the most enthusiastic crowds and
electronic music fans. It was a showcase for our culture and while it w=
ill
be greatly missed, we can hopefully look forward to seeing them again i=
n a
different context soon."
Christopher Lawrence, Moonshine, Los Angeles

"Here at System, we were deeply saddened and angry when the news came d=
own
that Buzz at Nation was to be no more. Scott Henry, John Tab, Amanda Hu=
ie,
and crew ran what was arguably the finest weekly club event in the coun=
try.
While we can certainly understand the government's position of wanting =
to
cut down drug use, we think it is vastly ignorant to assume that by
preventing dance music events from happening it is going to eliminate t=
hese
things; it won't. There is a huge problem with the way this country
approaches drugs; the 'war on drugs' is a failure. Going after dance mu=
sic
and club culture is not the answer. Curbing people's rights to gather
together to dance and have fun is the real criminal act here. Long Live=

Buzz!"
Eric Silver, Louis Montorio, and the System Recordings family

"Buzz, thank you for bringing so much joy into my life! Thank you for
having the best resident DJ's in the world: Scott Henry, John Tab, and
Dieselboy, to name a few! And thank you for providing a SAFE place for =
me
to enjoy my Friday nights for so many years!"
Alison "looking to the future" MacKenzie, Hagerstown, MD

"This is a sad day for underground music in this country. As one of the=

first clubs I played outside New York back in 1995, Buzz always meant a=
 lot
to me. I can safely say that I've had some of my best club DJ'ing
experiences at Buzz. However, I remain confident that the people at Buz=

will move on to bigger and better things. Respect."
DJ Dara, Breakbeat Science, Moonshine, Planet of the Drums, New York Ci=

You were a regular stop for many UK drum 'n' bass DJ's while on tour of=

States and you will most definitely be missed, along with the phat hote=

rooms. Best of luck in the future and thanks for the gigs in DC!!"
Technical Itch, Decoder, MC Jakes and all the Tech Itch family, UK

"Going to Buzz on Fridays for the past several years has held too many
memorable experiences to print, from the first time I got to hear Andy =
C
and Randall with MC GQ in the early summer of 1997, to the Metalheadz D=

Summer Tour with Doc Scott, Ed Rush, J Majik, and MC Justyc, to the (Fo=

Escher in January 2000. Whether going to party, support other friends
playing there, or performing myself, Buzz was top notch. Good luck to

"Respect to Buzz and everyone who helped make this party such an
unforgettable experience for some of my most enjoyable years. I and
thousands of others owe Buzz a huge thanks for the countless memories a=

local DJ and a loyal party patron. They made it possible for DJ's like =

Jesse Tittsworth, 5", Surround Sound

"I saw Krust play Buzz for the first time a few years back. Dynamite wa=
s
with him. I remember he opened up with two copies of "Dictation" and
completely blew everybody's minds! The build during the intro on that s=
ong
is already pretty intense, but imagine hearing it build and build and
build, praying for a drop, only to have him just cut to the other copy,=

increasing your anticipation. Then he would tease in the bassline
ever-so-slightly from the previous copy that had already dropped. When =
that
bass finally hit, I don't think there was a foot that remained on the f=

for more than two seconds. Everybody went nuts and stayed that way for =
the
next two hours."

the vibe I caught that very first night will forever remain with me. NA=

all the memories! I'm sure the energy created will manifest itself
somewhere else in the near future. Keep ya head up!"

"Buzz was the quintessential party that put DC on the party map. It's a=

tragedy that it's over. Things were really picking up and I thought the=

for
our DJ's, and for me personally. On behalf of K-Yun, Malcolm Paul, Dee =
Jay
Clutch and Disco Stu, I bid you farewell and extend to you our highest
esteem."
Campbell Tyler, StoneFinger Productions

"Thank you to the Buzzlife crew. When I was 17 and attended my first Su=
nday
Mass, I was like WOW! All these people dancing, smiling, laughing, and
having the time of their lives. I thought, 'I want to be a part of this=

regularly attended Fever, Bassrush, and Buzz. Finally I was like, 'Man,=
 I
want to give this to people. I want to do what they are doing.' I was g=

the opportunity in August 2000, with my first party, Virgo, thrown in a=

warehouse for the love of my life, Christie. Since then I have thrown m=

parties in clubs and warehouses and became manager of the Remix Renegad=

for me. Thanks so much. I hope this isn't the end. Peace."
Nic Kempton, ONEMAN1! Productions

"A big heart-felt thanx to the Buzzlife crew for some of the best memor=
ies
of my short time here in DC. To all my friends in Saint Louis, I descri=
bed
Buzz as the EDM Utopia. It really was. Ravers, Randoms, Ginos, Jocks,
Junglists, Househeads, and Homies all dancing under one roof and many t=
imes
in total harmony. I have two favorite memories of Buzz that will always=

bring a smile to my face. The first one was bringing my Mom to Buzz for=
 the
Moonshine over America 2000 Tour. To this day my Mom still loves to tal=
k
about how much fun she had that night. My second is a time dancing in t=
he
main room when me and about 10 other party kids all did a spin in uniso=
n at
the end of a phrase. To this day I have never danced in such synchronic=
ity.
To me, that embodied why I love electronic music."
N!K Schiller, Saint Louis, Missouri

"Thank you, John Tab, for your music, your party, and most of all your
accessibility and good cheer. Know that you've got literally hundreds o=

people who admire you and will support whatever endeavors you care to
undertake in the future. Perhaps now is a time to press on and take
Buzzlife to a new level. Whatever you choose, please know that you have=
 our
support and fondest regards. Peace. Respect."
Chuck Bimba

"I grew up in Buzz atmosphere
Unfortunate most don't realize
What something means
Till it is taken away
The DC area has been touched
By a nine-year show
I remember the first time
The last time
I even could imagine
The times
I wasn't there
I was able to call it MY home
Thank you, Scott, John,
And all of the Buzz crew
We touched each others lives
In so many ways
And the great thing is
It shall never end."

Dennis from Seabrook, Maryland


"Thank you for many, many years of memories. It goes without saying tha=
t if
Buzz never happened, DC would not be where it is today. You provided a =
home
and a sanctuary for those who did not fit in anywhere else. You provide=
d an
outlet and a place where people could escape and live in a fantasy worl=

acceptance and togetherness, if only for a night. But most importantly,=
 you
provided a venue to showcase MUSIC on a level that I feel cannot be
matched. I can also honestly say that if it were not for Buzz, 5" proba=

would have never happened and for that I am eternally grateful. I owe y=
ou a
world of gratitude, as does this city, the people whom you touched over=

years, and mostly, the electronic dance music industry. I wish you all =
well
in the years to come. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, you will =

man, all i know is that if i'd even known about dj shadow coming to

 on that note, i didn't even hear about the show until someone said it was

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Fri Oct 11                     STEWART WALKER                       Colubus

FRIDAY OCTOBER 11TH : Stewart Walker/Geoff White :
Dragonfly Neo-V : 245-247 King Ave : Columbus OH

Stewart Walker, founder and head of Persona records, will be
making a rare appearance in Columbus on October 11th to
celebrate the completion of a cooperative album with local
producer Geoff White, head of the record label Edit. The album
encapsulates 5 months of constant long-distance communication
and trade. Taking advantage of a vast array of communication
methods, Walker (living in Boston) and White (Columbus resident)
had little difficulty exchanging ideas and audio on a regular
basis. In fact, the minor limitations posed by distance were
offset by minized distractions and maxed efficiency. Since audio
files were being uploaded and downloaded from a common set of
directories, only the best material warranted the use of space
and bandwidth. The album is being released by Force Inc. and
will be available in March 2003 on 2x12" (LP) or a special CD
version with extra tracks and global arrangement.

The October 11th show is being held at Dragonfly Neo-V (on the
corner of King and Neil) and will include live performances by
Stewart Walker and Geoff White. Expect to hear variations of
material from the forthcoming album built up, torn apart, and
woven together with other original music! Local DJ Christopher
Everest will kick off the event with sensual house music.
Admission is $7.

Hefty : Bip-Hop : Komplott 
The Twinesound is a structure meets noise vs. melody sound, always 
morphing into something new... glitchy beats collapse into warm swarms of 
static, long atmospheric drones become abstract soundscapes where cold 
dark ambience and stark angular structures meet.

combination. Three people, one sound.

Wed Oct 16               ELECTROCLASH FESTIVAL 2002                Columbus

Electroclash Festival 2002
Featuring Peaches, Chicks on Speed, W.I.T.,
Tracy and the Plastics, and DJ Larry Tee
Wed, Oct / 16
Black Box show on Mershon Stage

"The most exciting band you've yet to hear."
--NME on Chicks on Speed

Taking cues from early Eighties electopop icons such as The
Human League and Depeche Mode today's Electoclash scene is an
international phenomenon that is having great fun rewiring old
school drum machine beats and stripped down analog synth
melodies supporting oh so arch vocals, not to mention adopting
its mascara-in-overdrive retro glam style factor.  Drawn from
the lineup of this year's edition of Brooklyn's influential
annual Electroclash Festival (organized by Electroclash supremo
Larry Tee) this tour bring together the ultra provocative
rudegirl rhymes of the incomparable Peaches, the
trans-continental multimedia performance art spectacle of
Berlin-based trio Chicks on Speed plus the bonus fun factor of
Williamsburg faves W.I.T. and Tracy and the Plastics.

house anthems as "Ass 'n Titties" and "Yo Relatives" is ready to make you
shake it. Anything is game when Assault DJs, be it house, techno, jungle,
R & B or whatever -- as long as booties are bouncing. When he steps up to
the decks and unleashes that high-speed booty-shake, the audience has
only one option --to shut up and dance.

just loves to share his music with anyone who wants to hear.

with his blend of Deep Funky Disco, he's spent numerous evenings

Sat Nov 30                    ROCK THE BELLS 2                       Dayton

Wishing Well and Groovefuel Recordings, on Saturday November 30th, bring 
you.......

"Rock the Bells 2, The Second Ringing" featuring the following djs and/or 
acts........


Donald_Glaude ( Moonshine Records, Eden Records ) Los Angeles, California
A veteran DJ for over 15 years, Donald Glaude has cemented his reputation 
as a crowd-rocking favorite and one of the most in demand artists in the 
country. He is one of those rare DJs who perceives their role to be that 
of an all-around entertainer and performer. He exudes energy, dropping 
track after funky track, arms aloft, and has been known to join the 
dancers on the floor. Join us at Rock the Bells 2 to witness the man DJ 
Dan considers "one of the most entertaining DJs in America to watch live." 
__________________________________________________

Huge Surprise Orlando Breaks dj to be announced seconds before he takes 
stage. This guy has accomplished many things in the breaks world and 
people all over are playing his records. His blend of progressive and 
funky breaks will leave you in awe and wanting more, he flat out rocks the 
decks, and has done it in Dayton before.
__________________________________________________

UF0_! ( Phunkatech Records, Phylum Recordings, Circa ) New York City
Featured in magazines such as URB, XLR8R, Lotus, Mixmag, Knowledge, and 
many other 'zines, UFO! is one of the most sought after producers in the 
United States. Record labels across the country clamor for a UFO! remix, 
which guarantees a dance floor hit. A Bay Area native, UFO! pioneered the 
San Francisco Drum and Bass scene and co-founded the much respected 
Phunckateck collective, creating a new community in music. Now residing in 
New York City he is rocking more crowds then ever.
__________________________________________________

Charly ( Bassdrive, Well Known Djs ) Philadelphia
Spinning around the East Coast over the past few years has gained Charly 
the reputation for clean sets, crazy mixes, and an incredible vibe behind 
the decks. Headlining around the country with UFO!, Juan Atkins, DJ Seen, 
and AK1200, has earned, as well as provided, Charly immense respect. Once 
Charly is seen in action, it's easily understood why she has been touted 
to be the next best thing for the US Drum-n-Bass Scene. At the young age 
of only 18 she is sure to be the next superstar in drum and bass.
__________________________________________________

Trevor_Lamont ( NateFx, Soulbrothaz, Aliensquad ) Lexington KY
Trevor is one of the most respected and skilled DJs in the Midwest and is 
never to be missed as you might miss something spectacular. His experience 
reflects on his sets as he can always work the crowd with his soulful 
house music and break it down to its roots.vs.Samm-e ( Soulbrothaz, U.S. 
Hispanix, House Purists, Dr. Sun Prod, Senor MTSU ) Murfreesboro
Samm-e is one third of the nationally acclaimed Teamsters crew consisting 
of him, Halo, and Trevor Lamont. When he hits the decks there is a vibe 
that comes over the room and with him on two while T is on two, things 
could get crazy, and memorable.
__________________________________________________

Guy_Smilee ( www.gagproductions.com, www.neutralmusic.net ) Rochester, New 
York
Guy Smilee is one of the most popular happy hardcore djs in the US and 
with Jumper by his side they always bring the house down. Guy can scratch 
with about any part of his body, and make sure you watch on November 30th 
as you can see him in action. Like I said Jumper will be by his side and 
you all know he can rock it and let's show him how much we love him in 
Ohio. w/ Mc_Jumper ( GAG, Ruffneck Playaz Crew, www.neutralmusic.net ) 
Rochester, New York
__________________________________________________

Big Regional Surprise Act to close out the main room and rock it for an 
hour. These guys have been ripping it for a year now and have been ripping 
it all together for about 2 years. They made their debut last year on 
December 15th and will be closing out the main room at 5 with a set to be 
remembered for a lifetime.
__________________________________________________

Kid Chaos ( In the Groove, Infinity Prod )
This house music enthusiast is always a hit on the dancefloor. His fusion 
of disco house and groovy tech-house has helped him gain recognition 
throughout the midwest and get him on lineups with names such as Too 
Short, Sandra Collins, and more.
__________________________________________________

HE10 ( In The Groove ) Tucson, Arizona
Coming to us all the way from Tucson he is ready to throw down the dopest 
uplifting trance we have seen in a long time. The awesome track selection 
and flawless mixing will bring him back to our city more often, hopefully.
__________________________________________________

Mike_Donovan ( Bounce Theory, Scarab Records ) Dayton, Ohio
Mike is co-founder of the Bounce Theory in Dayton Ohio. Deep tech-house 
music for the sophisticated listener featuring smooth, deep, jazzy 
grooves. He will be promoting his new cd Paint the Town Redd so be close 
to the decks and you might get a copy.
__________________________________________________

Chromix_live pa ( Groovefuel Recordings, Do:Loop Records ) Cleveland
This Northern Ohio progressive and hard trance producing phenomenon has 
been writing tracks since the age of 15. His unique and powerful live set 
will leave you begging for more and make sure you watch out for his first 
release on Groovefuel Recordings later this year.
__________________________________________________

Matthew_Kelly ( 4-Score Productions, Katatonic Resident ) Nashville
This crazy scratching breaks master representing Nashville will make his 
first Wishing Well appearance and a long awaited one at that. Make sure to 
catch his set as his whole crew including Michelle make it up from 
Nashvegas.
__________________________________________________

Clay-Born ( Wishing Well, Breakline Crew ) Louisville
Clay is always bringing a new crate of records and a totally awesome 
performance to every event which keeps his sets fresh and new and the vibe 
totally flowing to the deep basslines and dirty beats that make up 
nu-skool breaks.
__________________________________________________

Foursqare ( Wishing Well, Metronomix ) Louisville
Last year around this time a dj was born to the scene to show everyone how 
to rock it, Foursqare style. The dope ass house sets she drops are enough 
to make people like Paul Johnson and other house legends say WHOA!!! 
__________________________________________________

e21 ( :SCENE:, Stellar Gruve ) Atlanta
The man behind SCENE Ohio made his first Wishing Well debut at the last 
Rock the Bells and rocking it this year will be no different. The trance 
selections he brings to the table are amazing and his attitude towards the 
music and his presence on stage show it all.
__________________________________________________

Nero_X ( Hypnotik Therapy ) Cincinnati
You thought you wouldn't hear the techno but what party is a party without 
techno. Get there early to hear this man bring it hard. Dino is an up and 
coming superstar in the Ohio scene so look out for him whenever you can.
__________________________________________________

Jigglypuff ( Independent ) Cincinnati
If you thought Guy Smilee was enough happy hardcore for the night you were 
totally mistaken because this guy will bring it in early to set the vibe 
and the night off on the right foot. Let the man we call Chester know how 
much we love him and be right next to the decks when he throws down.
__________________________________________________

Def_Leper ( Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids ) Dayton
What can I say? Sliced bread had a good, long run but now this is the best 
thing to hit the scene. If you miss this set you should be shot with many 
Fruit Pebbles until your bum is sore. The 80's pop and hardcore mixture 
will have you dancing on tables and screaming at the top of your lungs.

Present a night to remember - 35 events later, all three production
companies come back together for our now-annual Holiday Event.  Come one,
come all to one of the biggest toy for charity drives in Ohio.  Last year,
nearly 1400 people were in attenDANCE and with your help, we donated over
800 toys to charity in Dayton, Cincinnati, and Detroit.  This year we
expect to raise the bar even further with 6 headlining acts, Santa Claus
once again on the 1's and 2's spinning a sick-ass jungle set, NEW
HEADLINING TALENT, techno, trance, jungle, breaks, house, the chance to
get your picture taken with Santa, decorations, laser by Introspective,
banging sound by THUNDERSOUND, AND Bill-E performing a 3 hour live DRUM
set in the main room!  We promise your expectations will be exceeded and
your holiday will never be the same!  Like always, we pride ourselves in
bringing in new AND established talent - this time, we're just bringing
more!

***WINTER WONDERLAND 2***

DDR - London, United Kingdom (LIVE PA) - www.damndjs.com - Techno/Acid 
Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well 
as Stay Up Forever, Cluster and Choci's Chewns.  Whether you like trance 
house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno 
- Chris Anderson is one of those rare jacks-of-all-trades who has his hand 
in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic 
culture and if you like hard, techy, funky and acidic beats - look no 
further!

DJ Rip - Chicago, Illinois - Substance USA - www.fusedmanagement.com / 
www.djrip.com - Hard Progressive/Hard House - You know him, you love him 
and after last year's performance, we just had to bring him back. 
 Acclaimed DJ and respected Producer, Rip has brought the roof down all 
over the U.S. and Canada and on into Europe.  His production work includes 
works with Angel Alanis, Bam Bam, Alex Peace and more.  Rip is now taking 
his efforts to the next level moving his work into the progressive/tech 
area and he has been host of several Chicago area radio shows over time. 
 Without question he is a driving force bringing our Midwest culture to
the next level!

Vibe Raider & Urbane - Madison, Wisconsin - www.wellknowndjs.com - Drum &
Bass - These two MW females need no introduction!  Having rocked
throughout the Midwest and Canada together and separately, they have left
many a dancefloor in devastation.  With hard driving drum codes and wicked
bass lines, they will be performing a special hour and a half tag team
that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002 
WMC in Florida and had to bring her in to Ohio for her first appearance! 
 You won't want to miss this set!

Phuzze - Madison, Wisconsin - Trounce Records / www.poopiehead.net - Tech 
Trance - A fast rising star from the upper Midwest scene, Phuzze dropped a 
super-dope set at Bumpin & Jumpin 2 and we expect nothing but another 
hair-raising, hands in the air slam fest.  Playing out on both coasts and 
in Europe, you expect a refined set of some of the best uplifting tracks 
out there.

LIVE 3 HOUR DRUM SET BY Lexington's own BILL-E - Sundowner Syndrome : 
Lazy-i Entertainment : Sennheiser USA : UFO Jeans - The founding member of 
 Lexington, Kentucky modern rock act, Sundowner Syndrome, equipped with a
stage presence and energy that will blow your mind!  After forming the
band in 1999, then establishing his own indie-label in 2000, BiLL-E has
made his way from rock to electronic music hitting just about everything
in between.
 Be on the lookout for BiLL-E and Sundowner Syndrome in a town near you. 
 This acoustic drum set will be in the main room on a separate stage to
allow you to experience live drum circles during some of the main acts (it
will be far enough away to avoid it if you want to be massaged by the

Subject: {pb-cle} look at who's number i found.....

yes this is a little ot....but damn important.

I woke up this morning and thought for a moment that I couldn't do anything=
 to stop the violent juggernaut beginning to roll in D.C.=20

I was mistaken.=20

Join me in phoning the White House comment line at 202-456-1111 between 9am=
 and 5 pm EDT. A machine will detain you for only a moment and then a pleas=
ant live operator will thank you for saying "I oppose" (or "I approve of") =
the proposed war against Iraq.

The president wants to know. Tell him. Time is running out.

We can all support this war when there hasnt been a shred of proof of wmd a=
nd saddam's willingness to allow inspectors in (which is why we had the bee=
f, i thought, in the first place).

There hasnt been one bit of evidence brought forth, not one shred that prov=
es wmd, or that saddam (the bad man he is, yes) is a threat to the us or an=
yone.

Or we can see that this is a political and stupid move by this whole admini=
stration.

Oh i see a quite a few lives of american soldiers (plus more terrorism fors=
een in our future as we piss off the whole arab world even more with americ=
a's invasion of another country out of the blue) being taken at the expense=
 of so called democracy?

Ever seen black hawk down?
Imagine having to battle your way through a city like new york city (baghda=
d), with innocent civilians all around,  street by street just to try and g=
et to a presidential palace to oust saddam.

When will this administration's insanity stop?
And 5 weeks before the elections?

Here is a two quote i have that might interest you.

"The people can always be brought to do the bidding of the leaders.=20
That is easy. All you do is tell them they are being attacked and=20
denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism."  --Nazi leader Hermann=20
Goering

"Any people that would give up liberty for little temporary safety=20
deserves neither liberty nor safety."  Benjamin Franklin

Please pass this number on to those you know if you want!!!

turnout.  Happy Bday Eric!

[MR. BLONDE] 12:30am
It's been a long time since he's played Havana - January, right?  Lots of 
people know this guy ... and last time he played he played my kind of music 
... old funky breaks.  Put a smile on my face.

Two things real quick:

acting stupid and starting shxt at the club each week.  Please, please leave 
the drama at home.  You know what I'm talking about ...

Subject: {pb-cle} Jude Law's daughter swallows e pill

Yo -  I read this in yesterday's paper this morning, it happened on saturday 
according to tha Pgh Trib-Review

I dunno if any of yall heard about this, but apparently Jude Law's daughter was 
at a childrens party at some place in London.  Tha place was previously a 
nitespot bar/club thing, and somehow she got ahold of an errant e pill from tha 
floor area somewhere and ate it... You think theyd clean tha place thoroughly 
before changind it over but guess not... 

And Britain's e problem must be BAD.

Tha little rolling girl is 2, so I can only imagine how she must have felt, 
lol... anyhow, tha girl is okay, and probly from what I can guess not that 
traumatized, and I'm willing to bet that it wasnt so bad for her anyways, but 
maybe a little scary... just thought I'd share this with yall... its pretty 
ridiculous, I think... wasnt someone just posting about Jude Law tha other day??

peace.
Chris

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} The word "THE"

random acting out due to extended and concentrated self-imposed albeit
illogical exposure to nonsense including but not limited to extreme
exaggeration of accepted "slang" terms causing real and appropriate usage to
appear lofty and out of place hence alienating those who subscribe and
furthermore value traditional time-honored systems ?

perhaps

scriptophobia - the fear of writing in public

;p

A friend of mine went to the media opening last week, and they still had no
liquor license...

I tried calling, and emailed them asking, but no reply...

Almost wondering if they don;t have it yet, thus no reply.

Anyone know?

--==Hello hello.  Just wanted to mention that when a couple Moda people were 
on the 92.3 Friday night, they mentioned getting Oakenfold for sometime 
around Halloween.  And "DJ Skribble from MTV!" next week, as they so cutely 
put it.  If you thought $30 for Deep Dish was insane (which it clearly is), 
we can just imagine the price for Oakie Dokie.  I'd love to check the place 
out, but not for that price.  I'll be stopping by on a "regular" night.

If anyone went last night, don't hesitate to tell us your two cents.  I 
haven't heard anything about how it went.

I wasnt there last night fortuneately but we were throwing the Stewart Walker show last night and we had several people come there and said they paid 30 bucks to go to MODA.  They said they hated it and only stayed a very short while.  They even said and "Even if Ritchie Hawtin or any other big names we like play there we will never go there again".   After them telling me they just spent 30 bucks to get into moda at the door all I could say was "you poor things" and let them in for free.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Last night at Moda?/Oakenfold coming there...

A -- I don't know who Jeremy talked to, nor do I really care.  I was
there all night.  First and foremost I have never in my life seen a
crowd go as absolutely nuts as the kids on the dancefloor did when the
kryo dropped... I walked down from the booth later on in the night,
around 3 when it was down to the after hours crowd to see kids lifting
up their shirts to enjoy the cool.  Off the hook might be one of the
larger understatements of the year for the club.

B -- Despite the fact that Moda has one of the best buyers in the state,
there is a reality to the fact that DJs cost money, and that clubs have
operating costs.  Consider that Moda employs, by my estimation, 30-40
people.  That the headliners they're bringing cost at the low end
$10k... and capacity of the club is less than 1000.... so let's assume
that each ticket for each DJ is $10... that means that they're losing @
least $4000 on a "lower end" act.  Personally the price of DJs is a huge
issue, but so is the price of a concert act.  If you think DJ prices is
bad (the most expensive DJs in the world are still, for the most part,
in the five-figure range), go ahead and try booking shit you hear on the
radio.  Any kind of huge pop music is easily $50k-$100k if not more.
Clubs do not set those rates, agents do.

--==Hello hello.  Just wanted to mention that when a couple Moda people
were 
on the 92.3 Friday night, they mentioned getting Oakenfold for sometime 
around Halloween.  And "DJ Skribble from MTV!" next week, as they so
cutely 
put it.  If you thought $30 for Deep Dish was insane (which it clearly
is), 
we can just imagine the price for Oakie Dokie.  I'd love to check the
place 
out, but not for that price.  I'll be stopping by on a "regular" night.

If anyone went last night, don't hesitate to tell us your two cents.  I 
haven't heard anything about how it went.

  Stewart was fucking amazing.  Another legendary show in Cleveland with only about 50-75 people in attendance.  The venue was great.  A huge used book store with a huge warehouse connected to it.  This was our first time useing the venue so there were a few kinks.  We had the power go out on us twice and had to cut the projections off for most of the night.  But besides that everyone loved the space and the show.  Even more convenient were the huge garage doors where we could pulls our cars straight into the warehouse to unload all the equipment.  Geoff White was great as well as always.  He played a few of the tracks that him and Stewart are working on together for Force Inc due out in Jan/Feb.  They played separate sets last night but said after the release they plan on touring and doing a live set together.  I played some electro before Geoff went on but I dont think the techno crowd was feeling it (ie : the guy yelling "play tech-house" as I finished my set).  Oh well not everyone can have eclectic tastes.
  As far as Headroom/Experimedia and future events, after a very busy and event filled year we all agree we are feeling a bit burnt out on the events thing and it is time to hibernate in the studio for the winter to concentrate on our own projects and the record labels, unless an exciting oppurtunity were to pop up.
Sorry you had to miss it Jeff.
Take Care

`'least $4000 on a "lower end" act. =20

With a total turnout of 1000 ppl, and an average of $40 p/person spent
at the bar [I don't know what the actual estimate is], the gross is:
$40,000 [bar] + $10,000 [door] =3D $50,000 . add $$ for the VIP and coat
check...


Personally the price of DJs is a huge
`'issue, but so is the price of a concert act.  If you think DJ prices

Yea DJ's have a "base amount" that they usually won't go lower on [many
times based on the # of records/cd's/hype consumed in the area], but the
price of the DJ is typically based on whatever someone will pay. A lot
of DJ's want to play smaller cities, and they know full well that they
won't get NYC prices for said city. There  just aren't enough people to
support the show. No one will pay Oakie $50,000 for Cleveland [I hope].
It's too hard for the promoter to make a profit, and everyone in the
game knows that. if the promoter can't make a profit, they don't bring
the acts in, and everyone loses.

I didn't get a chance to go last night...and I'm sorry!  I heard it was
a banging night and I really missed out! There's always next week!

Hello everybody!


Just saw "Steal This Movie!" on HBO - about the life of Abbie Hoffman 
- I think it should be required viewing for anyone involved in a 
protest movement.

It also caused me to do a bit of research today, and in piecing a few 
things together, I come to this conclusion:


The most expedient way for Nixon to give teeth to the FBI's 
COINTELPRO operation was to create severe federal criminal penalties 
for certain recreational substances.

1) Many political activists were known to use Marijuana and other recsubs.

2) Recsubs were easily planted on or furnished to various individuals 
for the purpose of framing or coercion in the face of criminal 
penalties.

3) Free speech is protected by the constitution, thus political 
activities cannot be directly attacked; Cointelpro needed a means to 
interdict and incarcerate individuals involved in unpopular political 
action groups. Drug laws, in particular the controlled substances act 
of 1971, made that particularly easy.

(For more info on Cointelpro:
http://www.derechos.net/paulwolf/cointelpro/cointel.htm  
)

The unfortunate result of course is that now we live in a much more 
dangerous society:

1) Homicides rapidly doubled as a result of Nixon's war on drugs - 
the only other time in history that the homicide rate was so high was 
during alcohol prohibition in the 20s. Drug laws protect no one - 
crime is increased and we are all affected.

2) The resulting black market for drugs has created a very dangerous 
environment for our children. Drug use among 12-17 year olds has 
increased more than seven fold since the beginning of the war on 
drugs. Drug dealers don't ask for ID - thus drug use has spread among 
the young.

3) Over 1.5 MILLION Americans are arrested each year for recreational 
substance laws. Such a high arrest rate brings with it significant 
police abuses. Countless men, woman and children have been murdered 
by overzealous police seeking the rewards of property through 
seizures or commendations and job advancement. but more importantly, 
the arrested victims are subjected to penalties far more devastating 
than the use of recreational substances. Drug laws are worse than 
drugs themselves.



The only way to solve these 3 major social issues is to end forever 
the black market for recsubs, and the only way to end a black market 
is to end prohibition by replacing it with regulation and moderate 
(revenue not prohibitive) taxation.

The benefits of this approach can be clearly seen in countries like 
Holland and Switzerland where low crime and a peaceful society is a 
fact of life that we in American have forgotten.

WE CAN MAKE CHANGE

All we have to do is take action. Action is simple, and it takes very 
little time. If we all just spend 5 or 10 minutes once a month we 
could start making headway! Here are some things you can do:

A) Write your senators and congressmen. It does not have to be a long 
drawn out letter! one or two sentences are enough. Like:

"I oppose the RAVE act - I urge you to vote no on S2633"
or
"I oppose the War On Drugs - please vote no on any measure to 
escalate this unjust war on Americans"

Just sign these simple letters with your name and address, and send 
them off. To find the address to send to, just enter your zip code 
here:

http://www.congress.org

B) Write a simple (200 words or less) letter to the editor of your 
local paper about how the war on drugs is damaging our society.  Keep 
it simple and stick to one topic and idea.

C) Listen to talk radio shows, and when there's an opportunity, call 
in to express your view. It can be helpful to write it down ahead of 
time, so you can read it and be clear and concise in your delivery.


D) Study some of the information at our information site, 
http://www.Just-Say-Know.com then is the topic comes up at lunch with 
coworkers, or in your community group, or at a party, calmly point 
out the the war on drugs has not only failed - it's made matters far 
far worse.

E) Get involved with a drug reform group like Drug Policy Alliance, 
NORML, SSDP, or Drug Action Network.



Taking action does not have to take much of your time, but those few 
minutes are very very important to the future health and safety of 
you, your children, and our nation.





Regards,


Andy Somers

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Last night at Moda?/Oakenfold coming there...

I was there...

good things:

the venue is VERY nice
the sound system is unmatched in cleveland; surround, flown, and SUPERB in
quality, *perfect* in volume level
DJ booth is incredible, elevated in a 2 story funnel,totally stocked with
all the gear
hydrogen "chilling" fog system blew my mind as far as cooling effect goes
Josh Wink, 11/30
Lights were good, but not like a full blown production
perfect level of crowdedness

bad things:

the people, typical cleveland idiots pretending they were "blingbling"
bars:  HORRIBLY placed, with terrible bartenders that had no clue on how to
deal with a crowd, and had no idea about security and rules (managed to not
pay for any drink, in the VIP area, which I never paid for)
price (I didn't pay though)
Hydrogen jets dissipate to quickly
dcor is mismatched in colors, different blues used at each bar, with no
dcor on the bars, with stock items laying out in open view

my take, if they lower price, and fine-tune dcor and talent, this place
will rock

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Episode II: Attack of the clones. IN YOUR FACE.

With it finally now being official, I thought I would share with you that
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the clones will be opening at the Rangos
OMNIMAX Theater at Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh on Nov. 1st. 
This is full screen 15 perf 70mm film not 35mm projected onto an imax
screen, we will be undergoing an upgrade to our current projection and
sound equipment costing around $35,000 to be able to facilitate the film. 
Information about the reproduction is avaliable at
http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/feature/20021011/index.html.

Pricing and showtimes still to be determined. More info should soon be
avaliable at www.carnegiesciencecenter.org/family/omnimax.asp when
everything is figured out.

Will

With it finally now being official, I thought I would share with you
that
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the clones will be opening at the Rangos
OMNIMAXR Theater at Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh on Nov. 1st. 
This is full screen 15 perf 70mm film not 35mm projected onto an imax
screen, we will be undergoing an upgrade to our current projection and
sound equipment costing around $35,000 to be able to facilitate the
film. 
Information about the reproduction is avaliable at
http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/feature/20021011/index.html.

Pricing and showtimes still to be determined. More info should soon be
avaliable at www.carnegiesciencecenter.org/family/omnimax.asp when
everything is figured out.

Subject: RE: Re: {pb-cle} Last night at Moda?/Oakenfold coming there...

I'm pretty sure it's 21+. They were scanning ID's.

Pretty much dittoes on everything that's been said so far. I would take issue with the sound system being "perfect," though. (Definitely wasn't Arc (Vinyl), Space, or Roxy that I've experienced elsewhere). It lacked a little mids warmth and at points some highs; the bass took over in spots because the subs were often too close and the highs got lost in the vacuous ceiling. Finding a sweet spot was a necessity. But it still kicks everything else in town out of the water.

They misspelled DJ Skribble's name on the marquee and spelled it with a "C" -- "Scribble." We had a good laugh at that one. Took some credibility away for sure!

Cover was also bullshit. They advertised $10 and it was $30 per head when we got in. They lady at the door even admitted, "Well, yeah we advertised at $10 because that is what it will be but tonight we have special DJ's in town." Not cool to deceive. So I guess it's only $10 for residents, $30 for headliners???? Also shocking, considering $30 gets me three headliners in NYC or Miami.

Having lived in Miami, I felt weird seeing something so "dolled up" in Cleveland. There was more of an underground feel to the clubs in Miami, even though it was neon flashing lights and fake tits city. Moda's marquee, the garish blue and other elements all screamed "Outlandish"and "Look at Me! I'm prancing!" and not so much "get lost in me and completely lose yourself for a few hours."

They HAVE to stop serving drinks out of glasses and use plastic, and people have to quit boozing so hard on the dance floor. I nearly tripped and cut myself four times, and on several occasions stopped to pick up glass, only to find nowhere to throw it away. The one thing I've noticed about all Cleveland clubs is how downright nasty the floor gets because people are boozin' in a big way. The cuff of my pants was oozing with booz floor slosh when I left.

The most whack or deliciously ironic thing, though, depending how you look at it, is what Deep Dish did at 2am. They, believe it or not, dropped a full-on version of Michael Jackson's "Rock with You." Either they did it to slam the crowd or they sold out and catered to it. It was hilarious. Most people didn't miss a beat. Their best hour was from around 2:15 to 3:15. Dark and delicious, then they got bouncy again. I left before 3:30.

My $.02. Don't mean to be overly critical, because I'm happy to see that place up and running. Everyone should go and give full support, and hopefully with some time it'll become some sort of driver to the scene and give more underground folks more opportunity.

Subject: {pb-cle} bsp -  Mint (live pa)

Hello everyone...

Just wanted to drop a line to y'all. Mint has recently secured a new label 
new with Londow West Records, distributed by Unique UK. Mint remixed a track 
by 'Dream Traveler' (had the big track few years back 'Time'). The new track 
is called 'Structure' The disk will also include a remix by CL 
McSpadden(Hook).

If you are a promoter and have been looking for a solid live progressive 
house pa, than look no further. You may check out our new site at 
www.mintlive.com.

Peace,
Mint

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ....

this shit cracks me up

besides what was already mentioned it says

""This event,as already mentioned before, is a family-based 
event.....""

so bring your kids so they can get kisses and watch girls get 
naked.


this is also amusing.

"This event is $10 at the door 
until midnite, $ 15 after.For you out of state kidz,it's $ 15 all 
nite."

so if you drive a long distance, travel for a party, you dont even 
get the same door price everyone else gets because your from out 
of town. Even if you get there before midnight, you gotta pay $5 
more than local people just because your not from around there.

makes sense to me.




when did i completely lose grasp on this whole "rave" concept 
anyways? i dont get it anymore.

(I think this message might have bounced earlier because I mentioned
a certain banned undesirable's name. I've change the spelling...)

This guy's ROM submissions have been making me laugh for some time
now since they're so atrocious -- lots of misspelled words, he
*quotes himself* (and his quote is pretty lame at that) --> "In a
world that won't give you what you need, sometimes you have to stand
up and fight for what the f**k you believe in. And that's exactly
what I'm doing this time around." - Coleman Davis *aka PornStar*,
commenting on THA DYNAZTY

"Aka PornStar????" -- I thought that was s t*v ie t???? Lame.

Plus, it looks like he's judging the Kandy girl contest by himself --
so ladies, better prepare to flash your breasts for this guy or you
might not win!

Any DJ spinning at this event should be ashamed of him/herself!

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP: Finally released a mix

I'll keep this short and sweet.

I usually sit on my mixes because I think they suck.  Nothing is ever good
enough for me and I'd rather no one heard my mixes than to publish something
that has even one mistake.

Well, my friends and producer convinced me finally just to release what I
had "as-is" in the hopes that at least someone would enjoy it.  I think the
tracks are over done.  Too popular.  Whatever.  Yes, it's trance.  Yes, I
enjoy to spin stuff other than that shit, but, eh, I was in the mood that
night.

The URL below contains links to my most recently publish mix (done back in
July).  It's crude and ghetto, as I simply recorded it straight to my PC
from the line-outs on the back of my mixer and proceeded to compress it
straight to mp3.  No post-processing.  No leveling.  One take.  Yeah, I
think it's shit.

http://www.froggystyle.net/mixtape2.shtml

In any case, I hope people do download and can enjoy it.  If not, pass it
along to your friends.  You can probably find it on SoulSeek, too, if you
look hard enough (Thanks for the tip on that a few months back, whomever
posted that).

This is the point of the email where I state that, based upon that mix, if
anyone is interested at giving me a shot at spinning at their next part,
please contact me.  I don't expect riches, fame or even a gig from this.
But, eh, if I can spin some shit for people I don't know, why not?

OK, I'm done.

- Froggy

Who do we get to kiss, I wonder? Or wait -- is it going to be just
guys paying girls to kiss them? Lame.

Some chick ought to throw a party where guys get their cocks judged
*in public* by some illiterate, unattractive, stupid girl ...

i still love this record.  all i think about is the "naked on the beach"
party at this year's WMC where i first heard it - 3 or 4 times and get
somewhat emotional.  in fact, i ended with it last night in kent.

you get there before midnight, you gotta pay $5 more than local people just
because your not from around there. }}

This is quite possibly the most asinine thing I've ever seen. The idea is to
give out-of-towners (or out-of-staters) an incentive to come by discounting
their admission. This pads your revenue with people who wouldn't have come
otherwise, so you can't call it a loss, especially if you don't fill the
venue. Of course, this lineup is so OfF dA hOoK yO!... sHitZ wiLL bE sOLd

I'm sure they'll have no problem drawing from Chicago and Philadelphia.

I'm only left to assume this ROM entry is a misprint.

what im really confused about is what makes it necessary for you 
to reveal at the door that you are from out of town. you can just 
lie. of course, i might be missing something.........

what im really confused about is what makes it necessary for you to reveal
at the door that you are from out of town. you can just lie. of course, i
might be missing something... }}

Your ID. I've seen events where your out-of-state ID will net you a $5
discount at the door. This usually happens in larger cities, though, where
they can throw events which can pull from out of town or out of state.

with regards to the whole $5 more for out-of-towner thing, i thought it was
pretty obvious that it is typo on the part of the promoter.  it doesn't look

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Wed Oct 16               ELECTROCLASH FESTIVAL 2002                Columbus

Electroclash Festival 2002
Featuring Peaches, Chicks on Speed, W.I.T.,
Tracy and the Plastics, and DJ Larry Tee
Wed, Oct / 16
Black Box show on Mershon Stage

"The most exciting band you've yet to hear."
--NME on Chicks on Speed

Taking cues from early Eighties electopop icons such as The
Human League and Depeche Mode today's Electoclash scene is an
international phenomenon that is having great fun rewiring old
school drum machine beats and stripped down analog synth
melodies supporting oh so arch vocals, not to mention adopting
its mascara-in-overdrive retro glam style factor.  Drawn from
the lineup of this year's edition of Brooklyn's influential
annual Electroclash Festival (organized by Electroclash supremo
Larry Tee) this tour bring together the ultra provocative
rudegirl rhymes of the incomparable Peaches, the
trans-continental multimedia performance art spectacle of
Berlin-based trio Chicks on Speed plus the bonus fun factor of
Williamsburg faves W.I.T. and Tracy and the Plastics.

For more information on Chicks on Speed visit www.chicksonspeed.com

NO PARKING ON THE DANCE FLOOR
Saturday, October 19, 2002

After many years in the scene, we've all noticed that no one wants to
dance anymore. So, we have chosen to put together a lineup that will
COMPELL you to dance. Our lineup features the most energetic DJs with the
most energetic music that you will learn to love and will love to dance
for. On this night, there will be NO PARKING ON THE DANCE FLOOR! 


DJ ASSAULT (Jefferson Ave./Fused-Detroit, MI)
Spinning a style dubbed "Accelerated Funk", The man behind such booty
house anthems as "Ass 'n Titties" and "Yo Relatives" is ready to make you
shake it. Anything is game when Assault DJs, be it house, techno, jungle,
R & B or whatever -- as long as booties are bouncing. When he steps up to
the decks and unleashes that high-speed booty-shake, the audience has
only one option --to shut up and dance.

DJ TRONIC (Resistance Recordings/Liquid Vinyl DJs/PulseAM-San Francisco,
CA) 
DJ Tronic continues to spin his unique style of US Hard House, pounding
dancefloors from coast to coast. His energy on stage and flawless mixing
abilities have been making crowds move from start to finish, earning him
appearances in cities internationally. One experience with DJ Tronic on
the decks will definitely leave you with the impression that this man
just loves to share his music with anyone who wants to hear. 

DJ ELLIOT (the milk club-Milwaukee, WI)
Elliot has always delivered his music from the heart. Pumping up crowds
with his blend of Deep Funky Disco, he's spent numerous evenings
performing and partying with the worlds best. The Prince of Milwaukee's
club scene has been working to prove he is of the best in the mid-west. 

KOS & XAVIER 2x4 (Hard 8 Records-Parkersburg, VA, Cleveland, OH)
You know 'em, you love 'em, and they're back!

Will Robinson has been spinning and producing records under many
different aliases including AMtrack, Scout 52, and DJ Strangelove. His

Fri Oct 25             DANNY HOWELLS (halloween bash)              Columbus

Friday 10/25 Rise
Col. Ohio
DJ Danny Howells

Rise Productions Proudly Presents:

Friday October 25:

The Midwest's largest Halloween Bash with:

(THIS GUY IS PICKED BY MANY IN THE INDUSTRY TO BE THE NEXT NUMBER 1 DJ IN 
THE WORLD. HE IS ALSO ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES. THIS IS A DO NOT MISS 
EVENT)

Danny Howells
Renaissance UK, Bullitt US
www.Dannyhowells.com

Special 4 hour set

There are very few DJs who stand out in the world of dance music today, 
but Danny Howells is without doubt one of them. From his early years of 
DJing at Bedrock nights in his home town of Hastings, to the 10+ hour sets 
in New York today, one thing remains the same - a complete love of all 
music. It's this passion and plenty of hard work that has helped Danny to 
get where he is today. It's no coincidence that he's been placed in DJ 
Magazine's top 20 DJs in the world for the last 3 years. Danny has a 
unique, eclectic sound which as been described as 
"deepsexyfuturistictechfunkhouse" and it's this sound which which is 
shaking floors worldwide. 

With over 12 years of experience, Danny has become truly international. 
His hectic schedule regularly takes him all over Europe, North and South 
America, Asia and Australia. He's DJed in the world's coolest clubs and 
held residencies at Renaissance, Twilo and Home. With 2002 came the 
announcement of an exciting monthly residency at Vinyl in New York, where 
Danny's 10 hour marathon sets are fast becoming legendary. 

It's not just in the club where Danny has made a name for himself, he's 
also been busy in the studio. Albums for Global Underground, Renaissance 
and his own Nocturnal Frequencies series have been the highlights in a 
continually growing back catalogue of acclaimed mixes. As a producer his 
main focus is with co-producer Dick Trevor and vocalist Erire as "Science 
Dept.". Last year they released the highly successful single "Breathe" and 
fans can expect more to follow in 2002. 

Danny's infectious personality and individual style is what really puts 
him a cut above the rest though. You can really sense his connection with 
the crowd wherever he plays, and he has fully earned the label "the 
clubbers DJ". 


The Halloween party is always one of the top nights of the year at Red 
Zone. 

Costumes are encouraged with many cash prizes given away. More details 
will be available soon.

18 & over

everyone smiling from ear to ear, people travelled

Steve Lawler is a definitive DJ and producer: a tastemaker whose sets 
combine quality house music with the power to move dance floors around the 
world. In the last few years, he's ignited crowds in the worlds best clubs 
such as Zouk in Singapore, Space in Miami, Twilo in New York, Pacha in 
Buenas aires and the mighty Space in Ibiza. Courtesy of home in the summer 
of 1999 and 2000, he provided the groundbreaking sets of the season for 
many of those lucky enough to hear him. Just after the first two months he 
had been crowned 'King Of Space' by the locals - a rare and well deserved 
honor. For over a year, Lawler set the capital alight with his weekly 
Friday night residency at Deepsouth at home. I f you were lucky enough to 
catch one of his 6 hour sets, you'll know exactly what it felt like as he 
weaved his magic across the club's sound system, wowing clubbers and 
critics alike. In Febuary2001, Steve decided to finish his stint at home 
due to overwhelming demand for his skills across the UK, and farther a

"Rock the Bells 2, The Second Ringing" featuring the following djs and/or 
acts........


Donald_Glaude ( Moonshine Records, Eden Records ) Los Angeles, California
A veteran DJ for over 15 years, Donald Glaude has cemented his reputation 
as a crowd-rocking favorite and one of the most in demand artists in the 
country. He is one of those rare DJs who perceives their role to be that 
of an all-around entertainer and performer. He exudes energy, dropping 
track after funky track, arms aloft, and has been known to join the 
dancers on the floor. Join us at Rock the Bells 2 to witness the man DJ 
Dan considers "one of the most entertaining DJs in America to watch live." 
__________________________________________________

Huge Surprise Orlando Breaks dj to be announced seconds before he takes 
stage. This guy has accomplished many things in the breaks world and 
people all over are playing his records. His blend of progressive and 
funky breaks will leave you in awe and wanting more, he flat out rocks the 
decks, and has done it in Dayton before.
__________________________________________________

UF0_! ( Phunkatech Records, Phylum Recordings, Circa ) New York City
Featured in magazines such as URB, XLR8R, Lotus, Mixmag, Knowledge, and 
many other 'zines, UFO! is one of the most sought after producers in the 
United States. Record labels across the country clamor for a UFO! remix, 
which guarantees a dance floor hit. A Bay Area native, UFO! pioneered the 
San Francisco Drum and Bass scene and co-founded the much respected 
Phunckateck collective, creating a new community in music. Now residing in 
New York City he is rocking more crowds then ever.
__________________________________________________

Charly ( Bassdrive, Well Known Djs ) Philadelphia
Spinning around the East Coast over the past few years has gained Charly 
the reputation for clean sets, crazy mixes, and an incredible vibe behind 
the decks. Headlining around the country with UFO!, Juan Atkins, DJ Seen, 
and AK1200, has earned, as well as provided, Charly immense respect. Once 
Charly is seen in action, it's easily understood why she has been touted 
to be the next best thing for the US Drum-n-Bass Scene. At the young age 
of only 18 she is sure to be the next superstar in drum and bass.
__________________________________________________

Trevor_Lamont ( NateFx, Soulbrothaz, Aliensquad ) Lexington KY
Trevor is one of the most respected and skilled DJs in the Midwest and is 
never to be missed as you might miss something spectacular. His experience 
reflects on his sets as he can always work the crowd with his soulful 
house music and break it down to its roots.vs.Samm-e ( Soulbrothaz, U.S. 
Hispanix, House Purists, Dr. Sun Prod, Senor MTSU ) Murfreesboro
Samm-e is one third of the nationally acclaimed Teamsters crew consisting 
of him, Halo, and Trevor Lamont. When he hits the decks there is a vibe 
that comes over the room and with him on two while T is on two, things 
could get crazy, and memorable.
__________________________________________________

Guy_Smilee ( www.gagproductions.com, www.neutralmusic.net ) Rochester, New 
York
Guy Smilee is one of the most popular happy hardcore djs in the US and 
with Jumper by his side they always bring the house down. Guy can scratch 
with about any part of his body, and make sure you watch on November 30th 
as you can see him in action. Like I said Jumper will be by his side and 
you all know he can rock it and let's show him how much we love him in 
Ohio. w/ Mc_Jumper ( GAG, Ruffneck Playaz Crew, www.neutralmusic.net ) 
Rochester, New York
__________________________________________________

Big Regional Surprise Act to close out the main room and rock it for an 
hour. These guys have been ripping it for a year now and have been ripping 
it all together for about 2 years. They made their debut last year on 
December 15th and will be closing out the main room at 5 with a set to be 
remembered for a lifetime.
__________________________________________________

Kid Chaos ( In the Groove, Infinity Prod )
This house music enthusiast is always a hit on the dancefloor. His fusion 
of disco house and groovy tech-house has helped him gain recognition 
throughout the midwest and get him on lineups with names such as Too 
Short, Sandra Collins, and more.
__________________________________________________

HE10 ( In The Groove ) Tucson, Arizona
Coming to us all the way from Tucson he is ready to throw down the dopest 
uplifting trance we have seen in a long time. The awesome track selection 
and flawless mixing will bring him back to our city more often, hopefully.
__________________________________________________

Mike_Donovan ( Bounce Theory, Scarab Records ) Dayton, Ohio
Mike is co-founder of the Bounce Theory in Dayton Ohio. Deep tech-house 
music for the sophisticated listener featuring smooth, deep, jazzy 
grooves. He will be promoting his new cd Paint the Town Redd so be close 
to the decks and you might get a copy.
__________________________________________________

Chromix_live pa ( Groovefuel Recordings, Do:Loop Records ) Cleveland
This Northern Ohio progressive and hard trance producing phenomenon has 
been writing tracks since the age of 15. His unique and powerful live set 
will leave you begging for more and make sure you watch out for his first 
release on Groovefuel Recordings later this year.
__________________________________________________

Matthew_Kelly ( 4-Score Productions, Katatonic Resident ) Nashville
This crazy scratching breaks master representing Nashville will make his 
first Wishing Well appearance and a long awaited one at that. Make sure to 
catch his set as his whole crew including Michelle make it up from 
Nashvegas.
__________________________________________________

Clay-Born ( Wishing Well, Breakline Crew ) Louisville
Clay is always bringing a new crate of records and a totally awesome 
performance to every event which keeps his sets fresh and new and the vibe 
totally flowing to the deep basslines and dirty beats that make up 
nu-skool breaks.
__________________________________________________

Foursqare ( Wishing Well, Metronomix ) Louisville
Last year around this time a dj was born to the scene to show everyone how 
to rock it, Foursqare style. The dope ass house sets she drops are enough 
to make people like Paul Johnson and other house legends say WHOA!!! 
__________________________________________________

e21 ( :SCENE:, Stellar Gruve ) Atlanta
The man behind SCENE Ohio made his first Wishing Well debut at the last 
Rock the Bells and rocking it this year will be no different. The trance 
selections he brings to the table are amazing and his attitude towards the 
music and his presence on stage show it all.
__________________________________________________

Nero_X ( Hypnotik Therapy ) Cincinnati
You thought you wouldn't hear the techno but what party is a party without 
techno. Get there early to hear this man bring it hard. Dino is an up and 
coming superstar in the Ohio scene so look out for him whenever you can.
__________________________________________________

Jigglypuff ( Independent ) Cincinnati
If you thought Guy Smilee was enough happy hardcore for the night you were 
totally mistaken because this guy will bring it in early to set the vibe 
and the night off on the right foot. Let the man we call Chester know how 
much we love him and be right next to the decks when he throws down.
__________________________________________________

Def_Leper ( Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids ) Dayton
What can I say? Sliced bread had a good, long run but now this is the best 
thing to hit the scene. If you miss this set you should be shot with many 
Fruit Pebbles until your bum is sore. The 80's pop and hardcore mixture 
will have you dancing on tables and screaming at the top of your lungs.

Groove Reactor Records, D'Vine Intervention, and Buckwyld Entertainment
Present a night to remember - 35 events later, all three production
companies come back together for our now-annual Holiday Event.  Come one,
come all to one of the biggest toy for charity drives in Ohio.  Last year,
nearly 1400 people were in attenDANCE and with your help, we donated over
800 toys to charity in Dayton, Cincinnati, and Detroit.  This year we
expect to raise the bar even further with 6 headlining acts, Santa Claus
once again on the 1's and 2's spinning a sick-ass jungle set, NEW
HEADLINING TALENT, techno, trance, jungle, breaks, house, the chance to
get your picture taken with Santa, decorations, laser by Introspective,
banging sound by THUNDERSOUND, AND Bill-E performing a 3 hour live DRUM
set in the main room!  We promise your expectations will be exceeded and
your holiday will never be the same!  Like always, we pride ourselves in
bringing in new AND established talent - this time, we're just bringing
more!

***WINTER WONDERLAND 2***

DDR - London, United Kingdom (LIVE PA) - www.damndjs.com - Techno/Acid 
Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well 
as Stay Up Forever, Cluster and Choci's Chewns.  Whether you like trance 
house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno 
- Chris Anderson is one of those rare jacks-of-all-trades who has his hand 
in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic 
culture and if you like hard, techy, funky and acidic beats - look no 
further!

DJ Rip - Chicago, Illinois - Substance USA - www.fusedmanagement.com / 
www.djrip.com - Hard Progressive/Hard House - You know him, you love him 
and after last year's performance, we just had to bring him back. 
 Acclaimed DJ and respected Producer, Rip has brought the roof down all 
over the U.S. and Canada and on into Europe.  His production work includes 
works with Angel Alanis, Bam Bam, Alex Peace and more.  Rip is now taking 
his efforts to the next level moving his work into the progressive/tech 
area and he has been host of several Chicago area radio shows over time. 
 Without question he is a driving force bringing our Midwest culture to
the next level!

Vibe Raider & Urbane - Madison, Wisconsin - www.wellknowndjs.com - Drum &
Bass - These two MW females need no introduction!  Having rocked
throughout the Midwest and Canada together and separately, they have left
many a dancefloor in devastation.  With hard driving drum codes and wicked
bass lines, they will be performing a special hour and a half tag team
that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002 
WMC in Florida and had to bring her in to Ohio for her first appearance! 
 You won't want to miss this set!

Phuzze - Madison, Wisconsin - Trounce Records / www.poopiehead.net - Tech 
Trance - A fast rising star from the upper Midwest scene, Phuzze dropped a 
super-dope set at Bumpin & Jumpin 2 and we expect nothing but another 
hair-raising, hands in the air slam fest.  Playing out on both coasts and 
in Europe, you expect a refined set of some of the best uplifting tracks 
out there.

LIVE 3 HOUR DRUM SET BY Lexington's own BILL-E - Sundowner Syndrome : 
Lazy-i Entertainment : Sennheiser USA : UFO Jeans - The founding member of 
 Lexington, Kentucky modern rock act, Sundowner Syndrome, equipped with a
stage presence and energy that will blow your mind!  After forming the
band in 1999, then establishing his own indie-label in 2000, BiLL-E has
made his way from rock to electronic music hitting just about everything
in between.
 Be on the lookout for BiLL-E and Sundowner Syndrome in a town near you. 
 This acoustic drum set will be in the main room on a separate stage to
allow you to experience live drum circles during some of the main acts (it
will be far enough away to avoid it if you want to be massaged by the

Eventhough im the one that brought this subject up, im fairly 
confident that its gotta be a misprint.
I think it should say, 
$10 all night for out of towners, not $15

i dont think they really are that dumb. although i dont know why i 
dont think they are either.

Who knows?  He might have gotten one anyways?!?!  I was planning on

But you can still tell him he's HOT!

First off: hi! Sorry if you haven't heard from me in a while. I've just bee=
n
real busy, and travelling a lot. For those of you outside of the Philly are=
a
who feel like this email is not important to you: let me know, I'll take yo=

off the list. But keep in mind I only send this out about once a month, if
that ;) Plus you get links to music and other info, so... its up to you. An=
d
if you sent me an email within the past few months and I haven't gotten bac=
k
to you yet, I'm truly sorry. Its just because I'm sooooo backed up, there's
probably 200 or so emails I haven't gotten to yet. Please bear with me, you=
r
email is important to me and I WILL reply. If its urgent, please email me
again and remind me to screw my head on straight. Thanks for your patience!


. . .


Reflective has a new weekly going on... Wednesdays at St. Jacks in Olde Cit=
y
Philadelphia. Its called "WildCard," and the music format is all variations
of breakbeat. Each week yours truly (Imri) will be playing the finest in
chilled out nu-breaks and future funk grooves. We'll have weekly special
guests, along with monthly residents like Kilobyte and Clayton The Chemist.
The last Wednesday of each month is called "Four of A Kind," and will
feature four top DJs representing four different styles of breakbeat.
October 30th will be the first of these, with Miss Bliss (NY), PhazeOne,
Clayton the Chemist, and that guy Imri. $2 drinks, great food, no cover.

We just put up new messageboards, this time on our own server; which means
now we can archive everything, modify it any way we like, add features, and
not have any crappy pop-up ads or 3rd-party cookies! The board has been up
for just a couple of weeks but its already a busy beehive. Join us in
discussions, critique poetry, post your events, contribute to the drama,
share your insight, marvel at the brainfarts, cringe at the verbal abuse,
laugh at the spelling errors, hypothesize about the politics of dancing, ad=

I've been working on the new site on and off for quite some time now as man=

of you know. I keep putting off the launch of it because, well, I just
haven't had the time to sit down and finish it. But the concept is good,
once I do launch it, I think the site will still feel fresh and dynamic.
Since everyone's been waiting so long, here's a sneak peek for those
interested in giving me feedback, or helping me complete the dayum thang!

I'll be playing with the Tribe Ltd. crew in Baltimore almost every Saturday
night. Its called FREQ, and it takes place at Redwood Trust, probably the
nicest club I've EVER been in. The first time I played, it was off the hook=

ALRIGHT CHECK THIS OUT!
I'm trying something new. Clicking on the link here will download a .zip
file which contains all the tracks (individually) from "Dirty Breaks" --the
last live mix I released, in high quality mp3 format. Everyone loved this
one so I figured it would be a perfect test for this experiment. Once you
download the file, un-zip it, and you'll find everything in a folder,
including a text file with the track listing and all info for the mix, as
well as the CD designs so you can print them out ;) The idea is this: when
you go to burn your CD, you should be able to set it so there's no spaces
between the tracks...(seconds=3D"0")... you'll be able to flip through the
tracks on your CD! Please give me feedback - let me know how this works out
for you :) Thanks. Here you go......

http://reflective.net/music/DirtyBreaks_Folder.zip (110 megs total)

DIRTY BREAKS track list:
01. DIEBEAT "Hot Like The Sun" [Weekend]
02. KRAFTY KUTS "Don't Stop" [Against The Grain]
03. PSYCHOTROPIC "Hypnosis" Lee Coombs & Drumattic Twins dub [Fat!]
04. SCISSORKICKS "Livin' For Kicks" [Plastic Raygun]
05. KRAFTY KUTS "Street Freaks" [Against The Grain]
06. SIRIUS + AFRIKA BAMBAATAA "If You TechnoLectro" [Electric Kingdom]

LIVE @ SPACE 1999 - MIXED BY IMRI (60 minutes)

Recorded live at Space (now called Motion) in Philadelphia on September 8th=
,
1999. Hard to believe it was 3 years ago; I opened up for Grooverider and
Aphrodite in the main room. Since it was a mostly drum-n-bass night, I
decided to give it to 'em dark and hard. The people in attendance had not
been properly exposed to nu-skool breaks, so it was a real ear-opener for a
lot of them. And it was quite an honor for me to get appreciation from the
junglists that night, and to get props from Aphrodite before he went on.
Included in this mix are some choice cuts from the early nu-skool pioneers
('97-'99) like Terminalhead and Rennie Pilgrem, and you'll be pleased to
find the evil classics "Rockwieler" and the Tipper remix of Grooverider's
"Jack The Ripper". I'm very proud of the fact that breaks music doesn't hav=
e
the "hear today gone tomorrow" shelf-life of other dance genres, otherwise
this mix would sound dated! Enjoy...

" Most live tapes can be too raw to swallow, but not this. The entire tape
is so on-point, it sounds like he mixed it at home. Imri nails you with the
funky breaks laced with some electro =8B somewhat reminiscent of those happy,
vibey breaks sets of Scott Henry. When this tape was made, the Space kids
were most likely glo-stickin=B9 their asses off. Imri has impeccable timing o=
n
the Pioneer effects, scratching and crossfader maneuvers. There=B9s lots of
303 sounds, and it sort of comes off like house-tempo drum =B9n=B9 bass. He may
have even dropped a few d=B9n=B9b tracks at 33 rpm, but it=B9s hard to tell
because his mixing is so solid and blissfully funky.."

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Shadow remix

Just downloaded the Bad Company remix of Shadow's "Six Days"...

I'm SO unimpressed with this track...it's ludicrous. The beat is so
crap...they did nothing with the arrangement, I seriously wouldn't be
surprised if they did this track in 15 minutes in Fruity Loops...

DO NOT buy this track!!! What a waste!

It did take 15 mins. supposedly, fresh made this on his laptop in the back of a taxi on the way to a gig.  Wasn't ever really meant to come out, but when he played it at the end in london, someone from the record label heard it and wanted to put it out.  I think it's kinda fun. Very different for a Fresh / )eib( tune.  The mastering on the vinyl press is quite shitty though.

thats because badco are poop. their heavy metal shit was one of 
the worst things to happen to drum and bass. though i find it 
interesting that apparently they have a house music label now. 
huh. they still fucking suck.

As for the rest of us that are still here. Come down to Havana 
tonight!

Mikebee, is my opinion is the best broken beat/2 step dj most of 
you are ever going to hear. He's very smooth, and his selection is 
second to none. so check him out if you can. I know i'll be there!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Shadow remix

i think bc's house label is called halo or something like that...junior 
sanchez did a track for them...i dont know if they released anything 
since...i read somewhere that fresh did 6days with abelton live...usually 
they use an emu and protools or logic with outboard processing and a mixing 
desk...so thats why it doesnt sound as tearing as their normal shit...bc has 
a bad track record with vinyl mastering...the sampler for the dnb arena 
album (i believe it was called rage) was so poorly pressed that i had to 
crank the gain to like 75% to get it to sound right...i dont think they use 
the exchage all the time to make the master plates...simon is the dnb 
master...his shit is always nice and loud...

talk shit all you want about heavy metal dnb tom....the bass kills anything 
else out there now....listen to the new bc lp on some 18's and get your ribs 
rattled...then you'll understand...also...on the new lp there are some 
chilled tracks...id say they sound like cause 4 concern meets teebee meets 
klute....wednesday, dosage, torpedos, and snowcats are on the arena for your 
listening pleasure

A girl wants me to meet her there but last time I heard a dancehall 
compilation I felt nauseous...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} TONIGHT! ALL AGES SHOW For all you REGGAE,DNB, and Hip Hop fans

I didn't like it. I thought it sounded stupid. I listened to it, I dunno.. 
close to a year ago. Gut busting bass is no good to me if the beats are 
whack...

I am sure I will hear dancehall I like eventually. I'm just not so sure 
tonight is the night...

Oh, I believe the mix was called "Ultimate Dancehall Megamix"


What a horrible night to have a curse.

Its great to see you guys bringin Mark Farina out, I shall definitely be hittin' that up, since I missed him when he was in Indianapolis not too long ago(found out the day before, couldn't take off work...).  We don't get nearly enough good house down here in Cincy/Dayton.  Should be bringin' a few Cincinnati folks with me for it, so prepare for the SW Ohio invasion...

Hope to see those of you I know there...

Subject: {pb-cle} Stewart Walker

just downloaded his live set from the demf last year.

http://www.personarecords.net/music/mp3s/sw-demf2002a.mp3

http://www.personarecords.net/music/mp3s/sw-demf2002b.mp3

I think its bs this artist draws a crowd of 80 in Cleveland.  It's
disgusting.  Whoever didn't go is so fucking lame (me included I should of
taken off work).  I really don't understand why this town won't warm up to
the underground sound its there for the taking. jeez.

It's not pretty when self-absorption leads to self-righteous anger, but then
the utopian march of the 1990's is past, and the world doesn't seem as fun
anymore. 2002: The US Government has outlawed dancing and dj'ing on both the
local and national levels making our worst 1984-meets-Footloose fears come
true.

Maybe it's more than that? Maybe rave hedonism died from hype and
overexposure without any help from the police. Genres split forever into
infinity as listeners strive to scratch the personal itch. When people said
"it's all about the music" you could be sure nothing could be further from
their mind. And rightly so; it was fun to cocoon ourselves into ecstasy
gauze, or the isolated and brainy perfection of minimal techno. Times are
dirtier now, so the music's gotta represent that. If writers open a vein on
their typewriter, then music producers must do the same in their studio.
Competence is not enough.

We take risks because we know we can be better.

?!?!?@!??@!?$?!^?$?$^?#IU

dancehall beats will break your neck if you dont watch out man. 
and anyway, dancing to the bassline is mo' fun anyway. its like 
new jungle is all drums, thats why its weak. old jungle you could 
pick from the drums or the bassline. dance slow to the bass or 
quick to the beats.

>Oh, I believe the mix was called "Ultimate Dancehall Megamix"

sounds like older stuff, which is definitely a more aquired taste, 
as it all sounds cheesy as hell now. if youre on soulseek, check 
my pipecock2 account and get the Vinroc dancehall mix. its like 
every dancehall hit from the 90's mixed into a 50 minute or so 
mashup. shits nuts.

start to realize that most "ravers" don't even know what real techno
sounds like!  They are in and out of the rave scene w/ happy
hardcore, trance, drum n bass, and hard house before they even hear
techno -- then back to the mall to find a new "image."  Imagine that.

I hear you there.  I go shopping in Express and NY&Co a lot and they have

kind.  Lots of good 2-step and breaks.  Makes shopping much more

Unfortunately, I think to have your ear to the ground in the rave scene
nowadays, lolli.org can help you figure out what the hell is going on.
And you'd be surprised at who is on there that has a brain, it's nice to
see people dropping and sharing knowledge on kids who otherwise would
never learn.  Those kids aren't on this list, and probably won't ever
join, I dunno why.

You know whats funny.... when I have had some intelligent discussions on 
there (mostly on their part hehe) I asked the person if they were on or 
heard about the PB-CLE mailing list...

You know the answer I get every single time?

"That list is all drama"

Yet they are on Lolli.

I wasn't on this list 2-3 years ago... but if you ask me, I haven't seen any 
drama on this list that deviates from standard internet fallout...<shrug>. I 
don't even need to mention the ridiculous shit that goes on on Lolli.

I think people are afraid to fill up their inboxes, secondary account or no. 
I guess Lolli has them putting out enough energy to ignore steaming heaps of 
waste that they don't feel up to subscribing to the local mailing list.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} List/Lolli (was Stewart Walker)

I think the single biggest difference is the type and endurance of drama
there compared to here.  Here the drama eventually goes away (with the
exception of a certain person with a mental disorder). People either
resolve shit or just shut up about it here after too long.  It usually
doesn't last more than a day or two.  That is not the case there.  It'll
last for weeks on end.  And it's not even the same type of drama.   On
lolli's it's like "You were hitting on my bf" or "You called me a slut" or
other stupid shit.  Sure, I've had spats on here before, but almost always
I usually up being friends with the person afterwards.  2 years ago I
remember getting into a big arguement with Lisa, and we just laugh about
it now.  On lolli, people don't seem to grow up at all.  It's all a bunch
of "you were talking shit on me" and cry-baby bullshit.

Give me the pb-cle eliteist drama any day of the week, at least that's
still amusing. :o)

Oh well thats the breaks and were used to it by now.  Gets kind of discourageing yes and at this point were definetly ready for a break from it all at least for the winter.  We will continue to support the music we love even if it means barely getting by.  But of course if we got more support we could continue to bring in more and more great acts.  A few months ago we brought in Legowelt, Orgue Electronique, and the rest of the Bunker Records Team from Holland some of the biggest names in underground electro (well as big as you can get without buying into the "electroclash" marketing scheme).  We collectively lost a decent amount of money but we all agreed it was worth it cause it was one of the highlights for us of the past couple years.  
Scrapeing change for flyers rules!  Now its time to move on to scrapeing change for record sleeves and shipping boxes of records to distros for the winter.
On another note im moving today and will be offline until Nov 1st.  Take Care everyone until then.

I think its bs this artist draws a crowd of 80 in Cleveland. It's
disgusting. Whoever didn't go is so fucking lame (me included I should of
taken off work). I really don't understand why this town won't warm up to
the underground sound its there for the taking. jeez.

It's not pretty when self-absorption leads to self-righteous anger, but then
the utopian march of the 1990's is past, and the world doesn't seem as fun
anymore. 2002: The US Government has outlawed dancing and dj'ing on both the
local and national levels making our worst 1984-meets-Footloose fears come
true.

Maybe it's more than that? Maybe rave hedonism died from hype and
overexposure without any help from the police. Genres split forever into
infinity as listeners strive to scratch the personal itch. When people said
"it's all about the music" you could be sure nothing could be further from
their mind. And rightly so; it was fun to cocoon ourselves into ecstasy
gauze, or the isolated and brainy perfection of minimal techno. Times are
dirtier now, so the music's gotta represent that. If writers open a vein on
their typewriter, then music producers must do the same in their studio.
Competence is not enough.

We take risks because we know we can be better.

I suppose it all depends on what you would consider drama...it takes a lot 
for me to really be bothered by what someone says on the internet. The 
Stevie-T shit is just a nuisance. I am sick of deleting his e-mails, but I 
chose to sign up on an off topic internet mailing list... I expected to be 
deleting e-mails all the time.

When it comes to a musical discussion or any other opinion-oriented type 
deal, its just regular stuff. We've all been seeing it on the net since day 
one, I don't even think twice about it.

Last bit of crap I considered "drama" was that Maggie Brown clusterfuck of 
redonkulus e-mails. But that just seemed like a little bit of Lolli leaked 
onto here...I thought it was funny, but if that happened all the time I 
probably would be really annoyed...

Oh, and you can't blame people one the net for being UBR l337!

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} List/Lolli (was Stewart Walker)

Hahaha, well that was my point.  The pb-clers are much more elitists.  And
true, no one does reviews anymore and netmeets are non-existant...but then
again so are parties.  Not to mention no one travels anymore.  The great
thing about netmeets (when they did work) was not only could you meet
with the people you already knew...you could also meet all those people
you talked to all the time from outta town but had never met before.
Maybe it's me, but that's not happening anymore.  Most people stay in
their respective cities.  Or maybe most of the people still on this list
already know everyone else already?  I dunno, that's kind of what I
considered CDG2 this year...I big ole pb-cle netmeet.  I got to meet some
of the FEW people I'd never met before.  We got to chat.  And people drove
in from all over.  It was a big deal again.  Nothing seems to be a big
deal anymore, if that makes sense.  It was something people actually
looked forward to and planned their schedules around, rather than it just
happened to be something to do that weekend.  Anyways...I'm just rambling.
The point is, I've never seen so much personal drama than when involved on
Lollis.  Maybe it's cause the kids are younger to a good extent.  Maybe
its because people go there and try and start shit.  But unfortunately,
that stuff doesn't just stay on the message board.  They carry that shit
out in RL and it just gets annoying.  No, I really don't care that
so-and-so was talking shit.  I could give two shits that wanna-be-dj's
girlfriend is hitting on anything that moves.  The thing I've noticed with
most of the people on pb-cle who I had some altercation or beef with on
the list and then met in person was that they were really cool once you
met them.  I can think of a bunch of names of people I didn't get along
with at first on the list but then things were great in person: Ryan,
Lisa, Tom 'just tom' Cox.  These are people I treasure.   Because they
realize that this list is just that, it's a mailing list.  And with Lolli
kids...it's life.  They take everything seriously and personally.  And
they can't just let things go.  I'm not saying there aren't exceptions.
Of course there are.  And there are also a bunch of people who are on
both lists.  But I think the people here have a better perspective at
times.

I just didn't review Ratana's last CD because we all know it's tight, and 10
other people beat me to it.

THAT'S IT...I'm tired of you talking shit on me!!! You are now my sworn
mortal enemy for life!!!

Amen.

I want something that everyone can uinversally be excited about.

TRUE.  Everyone SHOULD be excited about it.  And a lot of people are.  But
not enough.  Some people just don't know who Mark Farina is.  And that's
really a shame .

I'm sorry andy, but I always thought that expression meant getting laid.

i'm very excited.

i've been afraid that the place will be packed because of the 
whole halloween thing.  i've been pretty much anti crowds recently 
and haven't been to groove since it was at laga, so i don't know 
the weekly turnout anymore.

there were a few renegades hosted by some lolli people, and justin and i 
were fortunate enough to hear about them from hassling the kids ;)

i wish i had all of your cell phone numbers or something to call the good 
old crowd out.  there were no cases of mickeys at these new gatherings.  
just some people doing meth in plain view.  how cute!

point being that on those genres of music that i mentioned, the 
subbass is always rocking, but its not audible like the badco bass 
is cause they use their mids on their "basslines" as well. its 
sort of like cheating to make your bass sound bigger.

Maybe the first thing you should do to correct this is to discontinue

Subject: {pb-cle} Electroclash

This is just a goof. It'll probably piss someone off if I don't mention 
that.

The Great Electroclash Swindle.

Here's a simple Beginner's Guide on how to be "Electroclash", the coolest 
and sassiest fashion trend item of 2002!
Just follow these easy steps to stardom, and you can't miss!

http://www.phinnweb.com/313ctr0/electroclash/index2.html


Buy, borrow or steal some old albums from Kraftwerk, Visage, New Order, 
Human League and Gary Numan. Some knowledge of the early 80s Italodisco and 
Giorgio Moroder doesn't hurt either.

Buy, borrow or steal a cheap sampler/inexpensive keyboard and nick 
everything you can from the artists mentioned above. Add some one-octave 
basslines and disco beats.

Buy, borrow or steal a vocoder to get some fashionable robot vocals in. 
Besides, said device comes helpful if you can't sing one bit (though 
remember, this didn't stop New Order's Bernard Sumner to have a go at some 
crooning... neither Madonna nor your current favourite chart superstar).

For additional cult bonus points, buy, borrow or steal an old Commodore 64 
computer to make some bleeps with. At least, this will guarantee you a cult 
status among nerds, if you're still otherwise short of groupies.

Watch the 1982 cult film Liquid Sky repeatedly until you know it by heart. 
Then buy a skinny tie, a can of hairspray and some hair dye, plus some 
fluorescent make-up to go. Now, try to look as much as possible like the 
characters in Liquid Sky.

Now the hardest part: you have to try to write some lyrics for your simple 
two-note tracks. To make the task easier, here's a short checklist of handy 
buzzwords you might pick up from: cocaine, glamour, glitz, jetset, sex, 
lipstick, sunglasses, champagne, night life, disco, 1982, space invaders, 
Pac-Man, trash, romantic, Euro, electronique, lifestyle, robots, computer, 
sleaze, auto, plaza, dancer, fashion, style, human, cars, magazine, TV, 
seduction, silver screen, plastic, passion, android, leatherette, suicide, 
porno, telephone, neon, futuristic, robots, robots and robots.

Buy, borrow or steal some French and German dictionaries and pick up from 
them some sexy/authoritarian-sounding catchprases to make your lyrics more 
credible (a touch of Eurosleaze has never done any harm to anyone).

Now announce in public that you're gay or at least bisexual, and that you 
give good head (remember, this approach did wonders to Bowie in the 70s).

Try to manage yourself a record deal with International Deejay Gigolos.

If you can't get yourself any musical instruments and can't play nor sing, 
don't worry about that either. Just take care to get yourself the fashion 
accessories mentioned above, and then get together with some fashionable 
producer (giving good head doesn't hurt either).

When you're prancing around on stage like some stupid ass you are, tell all 
journalists about your high "concept" combining music, fashion, dance and 
performance art.

An occasional DJ gig will add to your credibility. Don't worry if you can't 
really mix records. Just get yourself anything made in The Hague and 
Detroit, plus for cheap laughs some cheesy old new wave, Italodisco and 80s 
pop records you found from a junkyard sale, and pretend you're "ironic" when 
drunken and stoned idiots get into it, cheer and clap their hands. That 
always does the trick.

When journalists at trendy magazines and glossies call you "electroclash", 
furiously deny this and tell you were into this stuff years ago before it 
became fashionable.

Who killed Bambi? (Oops, the wrong one!)

"When written in Chinese, the word "crisis" is composed of two characters -- 
one represents danger, and the other represents opportunity."
-- Saul David Alinsky

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Shadow remix

what you are describing is the synth line in bad co tunes...usually they 
have a synth melody(acess virus) and a sub bassline(just a sine wave from a 
analog modeler)underneath it...alot of times the synth and the bass are 
playing the same note on different octaves(the synth may be like 2 octaves 
higher than the bass or something)...so yeah i guess it does kinda trick 
you...bad comany's sound can be described with a few words...z-plane filters 
and waldof d-pole

the fundemental difference between your taste in music and my taste in music 
is you are more into beats and i am more into bass...i just had this 
revealation as i was mopping the girls bathroom here at work

they're pussies anyway and all they can throw at me is that damn drama term 
cuz they know anyone will back them up since they said it....that werd is as 
infectious as plur....it's just a sign of their mental weakness in my 
opinion...of course i dont attack people for having opinions i attack them 
for how they act and thats not even who they really are seeing as it's their 
"internet persona" people just need to relax or something and stop trying to 
be all rightous and drama free, it's just not realistic

thats all it is. layering bass sounds under a synth sound that you 
can hear makes the nots audible, whereas stirctly subs the bass is 
almost entirely physical instead of audible. if you fill up the 
low frequencies, thats all the bass you can have. its that 
midrange on top that makes the bass sound so much bigger........

>bad comany's sound can be described with a few words...z-plane 
filters 
>and waldof d-pole

in an interview i read with them a year or two back they stated 
that their equipment was only a maxed out emu e4 ultra. they 
werent using anything else at that time. those z plane filtered 
basses all sound the same after a while. 

>the fundemental difference between your taste in music and my

>revealation as i was mopping the girls bathroom here at work

nah, i like them both in all songs. in the best music (old school 
jungle, garage, broken beats) you can pick which one you like best 
and rock out to it. the beats are easily the least satisfying in 
jungle music these days, thats why a dillinja tune always sounds 
awesome no matter how played out his sound is. he's got the deep 
bass and the wicked beats.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Shadow remix

its all a matter of taste i guess...dillinja samples his own drums i 
hear...on the production board on doa they say they are using d-pole as a 
plug-in...d-pole is pretty cool...need a to assign nobs to it though...its 
hyper sensitive with the mouse

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} lolli.org


ok, that is sorta like how I post in messageboards, but then again not 
really. It's not as simple as posting to get a certain response. But I will 
definitly take the opportunity to be a catalyst if I have it. But I dont go 
trying to get people to argue with me so I can make them look stupid. Not at 
all. I try to get people involved in a dynamic topic, share their own true 
interests and opinions, and stand up for what they think is real and not 
fall into the cliquie wannabe routine. When I was in highschool I did the 
same shyt, but it was A LOT more efective when I was able to make an 
impression with my physical self. I think that while I put in my time here 
on earth, I should be honest and daring, always take a chance with people, 
and basically get people to think about what is real and why the believe it. 
Most of the time I get hated on for how I am because people don't like it 
when you ask them why they believe what they do, why they treat other people 
like they do, why they say what they say. I love to challenge people to 
convince me that they say what they say because they believe it themselves. 
But with the members of lolli, it got old REAL fast cuz none of them have 
anything interesting to post at all. This maillist is more interesting then 
lolli's message board. But I do have a job and I've taken up tutoring in my 
sparetime so I really dont have much time for interaction online. But as 
swoon as I get going back to school, I'm going to try to write for the 
school paper or something, I just really like trying to find people that are 
different from the rest of the empty souls, but just don't understand why. 
But the kids on lolli aren't the ones I'm going to put any effort on, 
especially since that clique keeps dissin me like it's the latest trend, and 
then I get banned cuz as soon as i open my mouth, they're all over it and 
lolli wants to get rid of the problem. Ya right, I'm a real phucking 
problem...oh well, I just dont flow along with the majority which is 
everyone on that site, trying to be cool ravers...ha! fuk ravers  they're 
just a bunch of highschool kids with enough money for caffiene clothes and 
drugs

no, there's really only one server. go to www.slsk.org and DL the 
newest version. this one hasnt been being updated much recently, 
the only problem i find with it is that if you keep it on for a 
couple days straight, it starts to take up like 40-50 megs of ram. 
all you gotta do is close it and restart it and youre good to go. 
my slsk accounts are "pipecock" and "pipecock2". youll have to 
message me to add you to my list so you can view my files, but ive 
got some good stuff. 

>This seems to be the jungle that I enjoy myself as well...its old 
jungle? 
>Jungle producers aren't coming out with shit like that as much 
now?

yeah, well the older stuff sounds nothing like the new shit. 
mashed up beats, hiphop/ragga/r+b samples, etc. ive got a little 
rareish greensleeves ragga biz on my pipecock acct, you can DL 
that.

I think he bans you because you act like a psychopath.

You were a main contributer to the "smack talking" and "weird drama", making 
you just another example of someone with too much time on their hands.

Maybe you should try reading books or doing someting a tad more productive 
then trying to get back on a site so that you can fuck around with people 
just as childish as you are.

PHSYCHODEATHBOY AND CO. WHY DONT YOU ATTEMP TO READ THIS AND GET OVER 
YOURSELF......
alright psycho death boy, exactly what is your definition of "weird drama"? 
I've never heard of this form of drama, and since I obviously started it, 
maybe you'd like to elaborate on your comments. See Craig, you know nothing 
of my situation with mister king shit of terd island, but if you think I was 
ever on his nuts and you can go making smart ass comments about it to me, 
you need to check yourself, because you have been on mine ever since I made 
you look like a total asshole on lolli. And I hope you know I never would 
have gone there, had you not made that comment about you forgetting how fun 
and easy it was to fuck with all the morons on the site, which included me. 
Sorry craig, but if you're gonna open yourself up like that to me, I'm not a 
little pussy like the rest of those lackies that think you are half as smart 
as you claim to be, and I will go pound for pound with you down to the 
ounce. I totally schooled your sorry ass that nite, til michelle jumped in 
and started saying fucked up shit and trying to manipulate the situation to 
fend me off of you. I was joking around with you, but she took it to a place 
I had no intention of going. But evil manipulators need a good flaming once 
in a while, and I was only honest with my retorts to her, finsterblix, 
however, didnt go so easily on her. But I do recall you backing down and 
dropping out with the same lame ass bite you just snapped with last 
letter...psychopath. Craig, I think I agree with you, because I am burdened 
with a terrible reality that causes me to drive people all over the place 
and usually to the edge. But, I think I'm wasting my time on you cause I'm 
sure you just want your chance to get back at me for the damage I caused 
your rep on that punk ass site that nite and you arent going to bother 
trying to comprehend any intellect I toss your way so I'll just stop here. 
At any rate, why don't you stop stalking me here on the pb-cle, and stick to 
the brainless of lolli, at least they think you're cool there. I think 
you're an asswipe. Get off my back ya little monkey terd.


P.S. For anyone else reading this, I am attempting to level with craig, not 
start more drama. It's up to him to quit with his shit, I just want to make 
myself perfectly clear with this email.

Last post on this topic . . .

you scare me (and probably others)! the more crap you type, the more you

Good luck.

(everyone else, sorry about this nonsense but I don't think I need to prove

I apologize for being so rude about it, but there really isn't anything to

I'm no authority on this list, but please take it to private next

I should do better to just keep quiet myself as well...

Subject: {pb-cle} UNDERWORLD NYC

an incredible show.. three hours nonstop.  karl hyde is a total nut,
this guy didn't stop jumping around the entire show!!

opener- "mmmmm skyscraper, i love you", the perfect track for NYC
obviously.  blasting thru cowgirl, two months off, dinosaur adventure
3d, DIRTY EPIC, king of snake, no move, river of bass, born slippy,
pearls girl, tons of others, and PUSH!!! (i thought the amazing sound
system was going to explode during this one).. a little bit of
everything.  

the crowd was interesting, very "old school raverish".  i didn't witness
many fratboys in action nor did i see any e-puddles, just a sold out
venue (think heinz hall) going insane.  

visuals?  extremely minimal (nothing like the "everything everything"
dvd).  interesting though, their "screen" was a wall of these huge
square bubblewrap-like things.  lighting was impressive but minimal as
well, with help from a very cool green laser.

no dats here, this is the real shit.

Subject: {pb-cle} Defrag: The Best of...

Now that the gallery program I use automatcally breaks up large lists 
of images, I can now post this.  Out of the 906 pictures I took at 
Defrag, I got it widdled down to a little under 500.  Tried to cut it 
down as much as I could and still have some "substance" to it.  Hope 
it brings back some fond memories.

And no, there isn't really any special occasion for this, but since 
it was Sweetest (sp?) day, there are some group shots that look 
really Sweetest (sp?) dayish :)

http://www.vrillusions.com/raves.shtml will take you to my rave page 
with links to the main image gallery.

The direct link is http://www.vrillusions.com/gallery/?jump=defrag

FYI, Defrag was a series of small parties/raves held at the now 
closed Hard Drive Cafe in Akron.  The pictures I have span from 
December 29, 2000 to July 27, 2001 although it started a couple 
months earlier if I remember right.  It was interesting going though 
those and seeing people that at the time I had no idea who they were 
and now I talk to all the time.  Anywho, enjoy.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} medeski martin & wood this thurs

I got to see them about 3 years ago here in Cleveland... and I'll tell you,
it was one of the best shows I've seen in a while. The only downfall was,
they were on the "Combustication" or whatever tour, and they had DJ Logic
with them and his "Project Logic," and I thought he sucked. Thankfully he
only joined them for like 2 songs, and the rest of the time they just mainly
improved and jammed.

I actually just picked up their "Dropped" album the other day... not as good
as "Shackman," but it's decent.

i keep avoiding seening them since i discovered the fact that they

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} medeski martin & wood this thurs

Yeah, the hippys do get annoying... but it was cool because there were the
people that were really into jazz and other music, that really appreaciated
the show there as well. I'd say though that the crowd was only about 20%
hippys... maybe more now, but its worth dealing with them. They put on a
great show!

Zero 7 fuckin rule. I discovered them by accident by way of a song I
heard on some Pittsburgh college station. Hearing the song, "In the
Waiting Line" for the first time in my car, I grabbed a pen and wrote
down enough of the lyrics to post a track ID query with them the next
day. Kinda reminds me of Portishead, but jazzier.

Zero 7 is a pretty cool downtempo group... I have the album "simple things" 
and its really not bad. Some of my friends call it elevator music, but I dig 
it. I think they had a couple tracks on the Sopranos soundtrack or some 
shit.

I like the song "In the waiting line" among a few others which don't come to 
mind right now... I think that particular song is well known now, though.

I was actually going to mention "not quite Portishead". Looks like you've

Well I'm currently downloading this stuff...as Portishead is my shit.
Massive Attack and Sneaker Pimps are also high up there on my list for
must-have music.  Been listening to a lot of Aimee Mann too lately.

Paul,
     I think you blatently contradict yourself. If you dont care then why 
reply at all. Are my thoughts and opinions so bothersome to you that you 
feel you need to put me down? Oh well, better bust out with some more of 
your blah blah blahing or try to use the word everyone in your accusations 
so I think your right when you say something to me about this, unless of 
course YOU REALLY DON'T CARE, then you should just not reply at all.
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
And Craig, your shit's gettin old, I have known I was a psycho for quite a 
long time, think I need a wortless ass like you to inform me of that??
haha thanks for the news flash connie chung....

oh wait, I think this might be even more amusing: Craig, how do you expect 
me to take you seriously?? Bisexuals aren't very reliable...hahaha

psychopath...that's one word right? But I'm not a violent psychopath...No

bit so I don't get banned from here too.

>you can deal with ravers but not hippies ?

how many times have you seen me at a rave/rave function in the 
last 3 years? i can think of dave clark and richie hawtin and 
thats like it. any other times have been when im spinning. and i 
like going to havana because theres like no ravers, and generally 
few "rave people" and i dont know anyone in general. and yes, if 
you can believe it, i hate hippies more than ravers.

Hey Maggie-

If you wouldnt talk in run-on sentences and PARAGRAPHS for that matter, maybe ppl would take notice to you, and maybe hear your point.  If not, I along with many, would not even attempt to read your ands ands and more ands AND maybe take you seriously.  Hell, even I was more sensible about it while I was being obstinent and confrontational... you on tha other hand, sound stupid and more like someone who likes fighting with someone for nothing more than pure sick pleasure on your part.  ugh.

Flame me all you want lol.  I've seen it all.

PEACE.
Chris

I think she enjoys seeing the responses.  How about not fueling the fire.
Being passive can help in a lot of ways.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Track Questions

bugz are a loose collective of producers from london.  they're known for all
different flavors of deep house/lounge, but more recently for the whole
broken beat thing.  they're usually lumped together with jazzanova, dego,
afronaught, etc.

zero 7 get compared to portishead a lot.  until recently they were more
known for their remixes (lenny kravitz, radiohead, sneaker pimps).  good
downtempo shit.

Well, first off i've never heard of bugz in the attic before, and zero 7
doesnt ring too much of a bell for me, but the track is pretty dope... it is

Look for the Photek mix of "Destiny".

Good stuff right there. This track skirts that line between techno and house
beautifully.

Subject: {pb-cle} no parking on the dance floor - dayton oh.

long time since i've done a review, but i had this typed up for my blog, a
2-fer-1.  wooop, lazy people unite.

so we drive down there, pull up and hear the thump thump thump outside the
building.  cars everywhere.  it really looked like alot of people.

no such luck once inside.   well maybe 5-600? IMO, bj thinks less.  anyhow
the x-dome is HUGE.  really FUCKING HUGE.  it would have been a slamming
party with 500-1000 more people.

not bad lights & sound.  well maybe a little light on the sound for the
size of the place, but not bad up close.  6 trackspots, one died thru the
night.

so dj tronic is on spinning hard house and seems to be making the needle
skip an awful lot?  hard house is just so boring.  god.  who buys this
stuff?  if people are paying money for this stuff, i can crank that stuff
out with my eyes closed.  i should sell it under a pseudonym.

dj assault comes up and starts fucking with the speed controls on the
decks.  ugg.....  anyhow for a booty type dj, he's pretty solid.  after
seeing dj funk play the same records 3 times during his set though...
funk gives booty a bad name.  anyhow assault is pretty good, and he does
some neat stuff with doubles, and knows to keep the played out--but for
some reason required--tracks on for a very short time, or he does
interesting stuff with the doubles.  sometimes a little sloppy on the mix,
but fast at it.  record hits the deck and is in the mix in a few seconds.
damn.

after that was house, house, deep house and deep house.  fuck'n yuck.
with 2 rooms i'd have thought they could have put some variety in the 2nd
room, i was rather expecting it actually.

these 2 junglists came on, but was hard to figure out what they were
playing with the mc being annoying. i figured 5am, 3 1/2 hour drive ahead.
leave while the getting was good.

verdict?  assault wasn't bad, wasn't into all the house or MC.  a smaller
venue or more people would have made a tighter event.

You missed Kaiten throw some hhc to close out the night,...  lol.  So =
did I.

I'm a big fan of Tronic, so I was dancing my ass off for most of his =
set..  I don't hear much US hard house anymore, so it's a nice break =
from all the dnb and trance..

Clayborn was thowing some serious nu skool in the 2nd room around =
midnight when I got there.  Nostalgic and Mike Donovan are two of the =
best area pure house DJ's, always a pleasure.  I left Assault's set for =
the back room almost as soon as he got on...=20

I guess they're remodeling the ghetto dome, so it looked a bit nicer =
than usual.

  long time since i've done a review, but i had this typed up for my =
blog, a
  2-fer-1.  wooop, lazy people unite.

  so we drive down there, pull up and hear the thump thump thump outside =
the
  building.  cars everywhere.  it really looked like alot of people.

  no such luck once inside.   well maybe 5-600? IMO, bj thinks less.  =
anyhow
  the x-dome is HUGE.  really FUCKING HUGE.  it would have been a =
slamming
  party with 500-1000 more people.

  not bad lights & sound.  well maybe a little light on the sound for =
the
  size of the place, but not bad up close.  6 trackspots, one died thru =
the
  night.

  so dj tronic is on spinning hard house and seems to be making the =
needle
  skip an awful lot?  hard house is just so boring.  god.  who buys this
  stuff?  if people are paying money for this stuff, i can crank that =
stuff
  out with my eyes closed.  i should sell it under a pseudonym.

  dj assault comes up and starts fucking with the speed controls on the
  decks.  ugg.....  anyhow for a booty type dj, he's pretty solid.  =
after
  seeing dj funk play the same records 3 times during his set though...
  funk gives booty a bad name.  anyhow assault is pretty good, and he =
does
  some neat stuff with doubles, and knows to keep the played out--but =
for
  some reason required--tracks on for a very short time, or he does
  interesting stuff with the doubles.  sometimes a little sloppy on the =
mix,
  but fast at it.  record hits the deck and is in the mix in a few =
seconds.
  damn.

  after that was house, house, deep house and deep house.  fuck'n yuck.
  with 2 rooms i'd have thought they could have put some variety in the =
2nd
  room, i was rather expecting it actually.

  these 2 junglists came on, but was hard to figure out what they were
  playing with the mc being annoying. i figured 5am, 3 1/2 hour drive =
ahead.
  leave while the getting was good.

  verdict?  assault wasn't bad, wasn't into all the house or MC.  a =
smaller
  venue or more people would have made a tighter event.


  --
  After all, my teeth are pretty sharp.
  (Especially the one I chipped on that "Jesus Loves You" candy from my
  grandmother -- oh the irony!)  -- chloe galvanic

In case you missed him at Havana (shame on you) last Thursday, Mike Bee
will be performing at Velvet Tuesdays tomorrow.  I am excited to be able
to have this man, an excellent DJ as well as the head of True Intent, a US
Atmospheric drum n bass label, play for us in the intimate spot that is
the Memphis Lounge.  He will be playing Broken Beat and 2 step selections.
Shawn Rudiman will also be performing a splendid Live PA that I know
most of you continue to miss out on, sadly.

Just a heads up.. full lineup and timeslots tomorrow!

Maggie with long red hair from back in the day?.....I think you are talking about me! (And I definitely am not the Maggie that is drudging up all the childish "I need attention"  bullshit.)   Anyways, Hi!!!!  Who is this?  Hope all is well!  I WILL be attending the Mark Farina event on Friday....and there is a 50/50 chance I will make it out to velvet Tuesday tomorrow.  (might be babysitting my nephew)  I would love to see some friendly faces of old times!  Give me a hollar if you are going!

Subject: {pb-cle} This Tuesday Night! GET DRIZZY SAGE vs BINAC FOR FREE!!!!!!!

GET DRIZZY Drum n' Bass, Breaks, and Hip Hop
728 Copeland Street Pittsburgh, PA 15206
Every Tuesday Hosted by DJ RA
10/22/2002
SPECIAL Headliner Night!
SAGE vs BINAC FOR FREE!!!!!!!
(Happy birthday Dj Ra)



SAGE:Belfest Ireland
(Phylum,greenlabel,Phunkatek,Groundscore)

Sage gained her notoriety through hard work, her exceptional talent for 
picking tracks and keeping the dance floors packed. She takes her audience 
into a euphoric frenzy and leaves them screaming for more. Part of the 
much-respected Phunckateck collective, Sage is undisputedly one of the best 
DJs in the US.
Besides being a DJ and producing, Sage currently runs her own record label 
with partners UFO! and Elektra called Phylum Recordings.
She started her musical endeavors at the age of 4 by learning to play the 
piano and soon graduated to the violin at the age of 5. Drums became Sage's 
instrument of choice as she began playing in punk bands in Belfast, Ireland 
where she spent most of her youth.
Perhaps it was her musical training or just innate ability, but it was very 
apparent from the start that Sage's musical sensibilities made her an 
exceptional DJ. Phunckateck founders Noel and UFO! immediately recognized 
her abilities and invited her to be a member of Phunckateck.
Playing out as much as possible, Sage quickly became in demand and gained 
residencies at local clubs such as Phunckateck, Eklektic, Phuturo, and the 
Blue Room. She also started getting booked to play at major raves like Quest 
and Thump. Now even with residencies across the country in Atlanta, GA, 
Raleigh, NC, Chattanooga, TN, and Washington, D.C., she continues to be 
invited to play at venues across the country and around the world.
Sage is currently working on two mix CD projects and is simultaneously 
working on an original material album with partner in crime, Elektra.
She is also the subject of an upcoming documentary entitled, "2 AM", which 
is a study of DJ life. This is a unique documentary focusing on people who 
work within and support a vibrant nightlife industry.
In addition to all of this, she somehow found time to cut vocals on an )E|B( 
(BC Recordings) track called Breathe. If that hasn't worn her out, Sage also 
finds time to model for prestigious clients such as Levi's, DC Shoes, and T3 
Magazine.
But it is her DJ/producing skills that has her featured in magazines such as 
URB, XLR8R, Lotus, BPMCulture, Mixmag, Knowledge, Seventeen, Harper's Bazaar 
and many other U.S.'zines.
In January Y2K, Sage returned from a well-received European tour with 
co-conspirator and Phunckateck icon UFO! and Germany's Panacea to find she 
had won "Clubbie Award" for Best Drum & Bass DJ from SF-Nite's Awards 2000.
Sage is concentrating on producing and is always burning to get back into 
her home-built Divination 5 Studio, where she continues to hone her 
production skills.

Subject: {pb-cle} Velvet Tonight - VERY SPECIAL GUEST - FREE!

Since many of you missed Ed Um last week, it appears that the Broken Beat
gods are smiling upon Pittsburgh.  They are offering you a second chance
in 7 days to hear the avante garde stylings of Mike Bee who rocked it at
Havana last week (I overheard one very fine, but disappointed patron
asking him "why aren't you still playing records" when the next DJ went
on).  Mike runs some very successful club nights out in SF, in addition to
having the future breaks radio show, and running an atmospheric drum n
bass label, True Intent, whose last release has been absolutely HAMMERED
by yours truly.

I mean, honestly, I say this every week because it's true, but you don't
want to miss this night!  If you love electronic music, but the genre of
"broken beat" is unfamiliar to you, you actually do owe it to yourself to
come check it out.  Similarly, if you like cheap beer specials, and the
idea of "$1 yuenglings" is largely unfamiliar to you, you also owe it to
yourself to come out!

Unfortunately, Shawn Rudiman, who was scheduled to perform live, will not
be able to make it.  The Technoir record is arriving today, and he needs
to prepare the silk screen for the hand-screened jackets :)

Timeslots:
11-12:30 Mike Bee (FutureBreaks FM, The Top, True Intent) - San Francisco
12:30-2 Ikari Bakudan
10-11 Jwan Allen

$1 Yuenglings and Iron Citys from 10-12!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} halloween groove ..

Well it's supposed to be $15 with $3 off if you dress like an angel or a
demon.  All other costumes have to pay full price.  But I talked to Ted
this weekend and because of an excessive cost, they might just make it
$15 for everyone...and that's a gift honestly.  Bringing Mark Farina in is
more expensive than you might think.  Honestly people...my recommendation
if that even if they do honor the $3 off with an angel or demon/devil
costume, give them the whole $15 anyways.  They're bringing in a class act
and for all the good they've done and tried keeping costs down, what's the
extra $3 to you?  Not a whole lot.  To them it makes a
difference...meaning whether or not they continue bringing in bigger acts
like Mark Farina.

Subject: {pb-cle} Mark Farina & SmartieRoc

I would encourage all of you who have never heard Mark Farina actually play to attend Groove this week...You will not be sorry. Also I would encourage all you legal-agers to stop by next door @ Rosebud to hear Clevr and Me tearing apart the wheels. I will be that guy who drank so much beer his piss has a head on it, walking around singing Ludicris' "Move (Bitch, get out the way)", and hitting on anyone with a gash between their legs. See you punters there...if you can handle it.

-- 
Ah, devil ether. It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel... total loss of all basic motor skills; blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue -- The mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column. Which is interesting, because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} lolli.org, yaaawn

Hm, does this mean you guys don't like me? 8( Ok, I'll go kill myself now, 
all the cool older kids dont like me. and and and and and and and and and 
and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and 
and and and and and and and and and a]nd and and and and    and and and and 
and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
run on snetence number 1. run on sentence number 2. run on sentence number 
3. etc etc etc...
All of you that answered are so predictable, so unoriginal. And maggie 
stoughton, you sound like  a little bitch, so why dont you just fuck off. 
Thats the only response you are worth to/from me. I hope you all think your 
still the greatest. Or at least keep trying to make eachother think that. 
You make perfect little americans, all full of pride. I am nuts, different 
then most people. I am morbid but honest. Just keep telling yourself your 
great, and have fun living your worthless lives. Of course you're going to 
hate what is different, not knowing breeds fear and fear breeds hate.  I 
dont need to try to get attention, all I do is type and you have to respond 
to try to put me in my place. So go ahead and try, you never will, and I'll 
just keep goin like I go. If nobody answered I'd do the same, try it out why 
dont you?

Subject: {pb-cle} Mark Farina this week!!! update

We are not going to be able to give the discount for wearing a costume
this week.  We always try to keep the price to a bare minimum... but when
we put a price on this night we were unaware that Mr Farina only flys
first class.  His flight is costing us $1900.00 rather than the $500 that
I had in mind.
Sorry for any inconvenience.  $15 is still a good deal to hear this man
play... most places would charge at least $20.
Peace

YAAAAWWWWNNNN!!!

Its not as if your stupid rambling really hurts us anyway. It just makes you 
look ignorant. Feel free to waste your time making yourself feel better. If 
we can deal with Stevie, you'll never be a problem for any of us. Have a 
nice life.

Hm, does this mean you guys don't like me? 8( Ok, I'll go kill myself now, 
all the cool older kids dont like me. and and and and and and and and and 
and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and 
and and and and and and and and and a]nd and and and and    and and and and 
and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
run on snetence number 1. run on sentence number 2. run on sentence number 
3. etc etc etc...
All of you that answered are so predictable, so unoriginal. And maggie 
stoughton, you sound like  a little bitch, so why dont you just fuck off. 
Thats the only response you are worth to/from me. I hope you all think your 
still the greatest. Or at least keep trying to make eachother think that. 
You make perfect little americans, all full of pride. I am nuts, different 
then most people. I am morbid but honest. Just keep telling yourself your 
great, and have fun living your worthless lives. Of course you're going to 
hate what is different, not knowing breeds fear and fear breeds hate.  I 
dont need to try to get attention, all I do is type and you have to respond 
to try to put me in my place. So go ahead and try, you never will, and I'll 
just keep goin like I go. If nobody answered I'd do the same, try it out why 
dont you?

> I am curious about policy.. how long was it before St*vie T was banned?

it was actually quite a few months and it was put to a vote.  30 something
to 1.

jbrick was the only vote in stevies favor.  when asked "why" he said
"plur"

tom cox decided to be a fuckhead and it was put to a vote and it was
2-to-1 in toms favor.  i don't know why.  tom's an idiot and i voted
against him.  i probably would vote against him now too, but this time
because he's a pussy now.

after that i just said fuck it and i unsub or block people under the
"idiots not welcome" clause.  no more votes, too much trouble.

Subject: {pb-cle} PROUD to be a Raver-honestly

I was reading a bit of Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas the other day when i realized that in spite of all the degradation of the "rave" scene and the general mass appeal it has generated I am TRULY proud to be a raver. Not a raver in the sense of glowsticks and big pants but raver in the sense that I was there in it's infancy and prime... the following quote sums up my feeling quite well...
       
                         DUKE (V/O)
            Strange memories on this nervous
            night in Las Vegas.
                   (he gets up, pours
                   himself a drink)
            Has it been five years?  Six?  It
            seems like a lifetime -- the kind
            of peak that never comes again.
            San Francisco in the middle sixties
            was a very special time and place
            to be a part of.  But no
            explanation, no mix of words or
            music or memories can touch that
            sense of knowing that you were
            there and alive in that corner of
            time and the world.  Whatever it
            meant.

Upon reflection of this paragraph i realized that there are FEW people in this world that TRULY experienced that magical time and place in the world. Most of them are now travel agents, secretaries, computer analysts, record store owners etc. while the "backlash" continues to fade out the memories of yester-year and taint them with ugly scenarios (i.e. raves of today) that slightly resemble "the good ol' days". 
                 
                         DUKE (V/O)
            So now, less than five years later,
            you can go up on a steep hill in
            Las Vegas and look west, and with
            the right kind of eyes you can
            almost see the high water mark --
            that place where the wave finally
            broke and rolled back.

So yes, I AM PROUD TO BE A RAVER...and when someone asks you (if you were there) "Are you a raver?" ...tell them "Fuck You...I AM A RAVER". Yes my friends the wave broke and rolled back years ago but there will always be another wave behind it...another generation, another decade... but nothing can touch the feeling of knowing that you were "there and alive in that corner of time and the world."

Hell yeah!!

If anyone here has my set from Taurus last year on CD's that I gave out, I
played that exact quote as an intro to my set.

It sums up the whole idea and ideal behind what we do.

            <<So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep
hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with
            the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark --
that place where the wave finally
            broke and rolled back.>>

Conversely...a lot of people act like the last bit of that quote too...and I
think that's what's led to the stalemate that the community seems to be in
these days.

<<We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets
of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole
galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart
of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two
dozen amyls.>>

I have a lot of friends who swear by the movie this book produced. They
mostly enjoy the scenes where Duke's out of his mind and destroying
something or other (see the "Loathing" part of the title), but this
soliloquoy is the part that always gets me.

I spend a lot of time involved in politics, and because I treasure
individual freedom, I tend to hang out on web sites that you wouldn't
normally expect to see a raver on. One thing I see a lot on these places is
the belief, almost accepted as just a given any more, that the 60's were
nothing but one big mistake. This is especially damning because a lot of
the people saying this "were there", and feel that they can speak with
authority. Much of the external evidence only reinforces these statements
(witness Ira Einhorn).

It's very easy, then, for our more current "wave" to be described in such
terms, and there would be lots of concurring evidence for that as well.
Yet I "was there" as well, and don't feel like my time was wasted, and when
the wave comes back, I will be there.

I've come to see large-scale human events like this as all going through a
similar pattern.

---

1) A very small group of people come up with a very well thought-out set
of ideas, and bring with them the energy and know-how to do something about
it. Sometimes this can be as small as a single person. Either way, what
they set out to do is typically based upon a very specific set of ideals
that they agree on (with minor differences among them, to be sure).

2) They set out to do something with these ideas, and needing assistance to
pull if off, surround themselves with people that they feel are up to the
task. These people tend to be competant, and often add a great deal of
energy to the job, but overall, still mainly tend to be "B-Team" players,
and usually don't fully understand the "why" of what they are doing. But
probably notwithstanding, this does generate a buzz, and that attracts
attention.

3) As whatever movement this is grows, the more that Step 2 accelerates.
People see from afar that something great is happening, and they want to be
a part of it. They don't realize, however, that if you just show up and do
whatever you feel like without paying heed to the point behind all of this,
you'll be sucking energy out of whatever is happening, not adding to it. So
they show up with their pre-conceived notions of what it's about, not
caring to test that against the facts. The result becomes more muddled the
bigger it gets.

4) So many of those people join up, that eventually the people who started
it don't know what to do. Folks look around saying, "Hey, this used to be
something...what happened?" People begin to leave, often leaving it not so
much to the people who started it, but to individuals who joined later and,
as it were "took over", by bringing a forceful attitude combined with only
a half-way knowledge of what was going on, forcing what they're apart of to
conform to their will, since the only option left to everyone around them
is either to fight them, or walk away, ie, submit.

5) Eventually, all that are left are the fragments of what was once something
great. Most of the people who never understood what it was about walk away
from it, feeling that it was all just an illusion in the first place. Left
behind them are a scattered few individuals who know that it was real, but
can't explain why, especially since they themselves are possibly feeling
hurt over the fact that people who get direct experience from it didn't fel
what they felt.

---

So why do I list this? Two reasons, and in both cases it's to speak to the
"pioneers". First of all, understand that this is a completely natural
phenomenom...unavoidable, you might even say. That this is the case is not
necessarily a sign that what you did was a failure.

Related to that is the other point: if you have any job here, it's to hold
onto, as best as you can, what it was that worked. If you know what you did
was good, then keep with you what that good was, to use again whenever the
wave finally rolls back around. Yes, it was real, and it was good, and for
those of you who understand this, the best thing you can do is to hold onto
that fact and weather the barrage around you that it was all just a
drug-induced frenzy of self-delusion.

Last Friday I went to Groove just for the hell of it: I hadn't been there
in a long time, so I wanted to see what was going on. What was going on was
seven people: that's how many showed up, myself included. I suppose that
since it could have been 7 less than that, that we can't conclude just yet
that we've hit rock bottom, but we can't be too far off from it.

But I know personally that I have no shame at all for the years I spent
giving glowsticks to random people, sharing mixes with my friends,
listening to the Good Word (McKenna :-) ), essentially following Duke's
lead. That other people missed the point doesn't mean that I have to accept
their misconceptions.

Midnight Oil has an amazing song called "The Dead Heart". It's about the
Aborigines, but it very well could speak to anyone who holds something dear
to them that others have corrupted or tried to take away:

	We carry in our hearts the true country,
	and that cannot be stolen.
	We follow in the steps of our ancestry,
	and that cannot be broken.

In times of quiet, when it seems that everyone else has walked away, I feel
that it's the role of the pioneers to keep these ideals dear to them, so
that when a group of people is ready to accept and be a part of them again,
they'll be there. The wave of excitement, followed by explosion, followed by
high-level but confusing statis, followed by retraction, followed by void,
followed by the beginnings of regrouping, is simply a law of nature. The
question isn't whether we can avoid it. The question is whether or not we
can look at ourselves at the end of a cycle, compare it to where we were at
the start of it, and ask whether or not we've made progress, whether or not
we've evolved.

I think we have, and walk around with about a dozen glowsticks in my
bookbag, poised for signs that the wave is ready to strike again.

If you are into politics you might want to read "Fear & Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72". It opens up the political can of worms for what it is and exposes the political process as a huge fraud of sorts...i will let you be the judge of that though. It's ironic that Hunter Thompson, a liberal and democrat of sorts, who is VERY into politics and watching the political machine at work, totally abandons the Democratic Party after seeing the inner workings and shadiness of the Party and swears off politics forever. Great reading if you are into politics. Anyway GREAT call on the Terrence McKenna reference...and i also wanted to compliment your well thought out response. This list NEEDS more intelligent posts (not saying that it has none....just that it needs MORE).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} PROUD to be a Raver-honestly

Great reply, Rob.

I don't know why, but I feel that my entire life has a common recurring
theme: I always seem to arrive 5 minutes after the peak of the party, 5
minutes after the most exciting thing of the night just happened, or 5
minutes before a "trend" becomes "mainstream"...and then it's ruined,
because I see myself as a bandwagoner...

I don't know if it's a predestination to mediocrity or if my heart is in the
right place, but I have really bad luck with these things...

Perhaps it also has to do with living 50 minutes away from the city (which I
did up until this year...)...you hear about it, but don't get to be part of
it until it's old news....

I've loved dance music since I was a young child. I grew up on 60's soul and
70's funk...it's right and natural for me to love the music I love, and yet,
I often feel as though, because I happened to join "the scene" when I did,
that I feel lumped in with those people in Rob's 4th step (when it hits the
masses who have no focus, and are more just "along for the ride"), even
though my love of the music and its history dates waaay further back.

Rob, keep posting, man. I love your words.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} bump 11/22 flier flyer however you spell it......

I remember a bump party from like 95 or 96.  Is this from the same line?  Or
something more recent.

  We are not going to be able to give the discount for wearing a costume
  this week.  We always try to keep the price to a bare minimum... but =
when
  we put a price on this night we were unaware that Mr Farina only flys
  first class.  His flight is costing us $1900.00 rather than the $500 =
that
  I had in mind.
  Sorry for any inconvenience.  $15 is still a good deal to hear this =
man
  play... most places would charge at least $20.

All of you that answered are so predictable, so unoriginal. And maggie 
stoughton, you sound like a little bitch, so why dont you just fuck off. 
Thats the only response you are worth to/from me. I hope you all think your 
still the greatest. Or at least keep trying to make eachother think that. 
You make perfect little americans, all full of pride. I am nuts, different 
then most people. I am morbid but honest. Just keep telling yourself your 
great, and have fun living your worthless lives. Of course you're going to 
hate what is different, not knowing breeds fear and fear breeds hate. I 
dont need to try to get attention, all I do is type and you have to respond 
to try to put me in my place. So go ahead and try, you never will, and I'll 
just keep goin like I go. If nobody answered I'd do the same, try it out why 
dont you?

Apparantly a lot of the "big dawgs" are that way, but really, they rack up
so many frequent flier miles, that they could probably upgrade any coach
class flight to first class.  That's just ridiculous right there.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Mark Farina this week!!! update

ok, i'm not exactly defending the first class ticket thing, but logging the
kind of flight time he does would suck ass to fly coach.  i mean, i was
alomst crushed by a 350 lb woman with something SEVERELY wrong with her
colon on a 12 hour flight from rome.  and there were not one, not two, but
three screaming babies within a few rows of mine.

at least he didn't make them buy his girlfriend a ticket too.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Mark Farina this week!!! update

The only DJ's that I know of that insist on business class flights are
Derrick Carter, Mark Farina. Some others try to get them but do not insist
on it.
No one that we have brought has wanted these flights.
Its fucking rediculous.
They could fly around the world like 10 times over with all the frequent
flyer miles they have... or they could just upgrade their flights to 1st
class with their miles.

I know you were not defending Mr Farina... but so what if he has to sit
next to a big fat lady the whole way here.  I have done the same thing...
but at least he is getting PAID some serious cash when he gets here.

Peace
Ted

That's my point exactly..   he's being paid mad cash to essentially play =
some records, or play some music.  I won't get into fees and all that, =
because a cheesy band will make 20x's a "superstar" DJ will for an hour =
set.  But egos get way in the way when it comes to adding riders to your =
contract and crap like that, and demanding first class transportation =

So I guess fat people with shitty (shitty?) colons don't fly first class? =P

I weigh at least 375 pounds, cannot control my bladdder or my colon, and I 
fly nothing but first class. They actually call me THE "Big dawg". (They 
also call me the 'leaky faucet' though too...)

I am ph47.

i would have to concur.

if i was too choose a party it would be democratic,
but recently it seems they had gotten too caught up
in the war machine also...but it has to do with
public influence...bush and the republicans had 
done such a good job milking 9/11 for all it was
worth and marketing war he had almost completely
brainwashed the american massive into pro-war
thinking...that's when i jumped in and had to drop
some stats about how the previous war had been
killing the economy/business big and small and 
caused so many lay-offs and there were more
important things that needed attention like the
natural disasters: forest fires out west, droughts
for the farmers in the northwest, floods down south,
the port freeze that was costing union workers a
billion dollars a day out west, lack of funds for
medicare/medicaid, lack of funds for education
since all funds were being funneled into the war,
all the other things the president is supposed to
deal with, but has been side-lined in lieu of war.

bush was into baseball, he wanted to turn it into
some huge end times battle, us vs. them...you are
either with us or against us...when not everybody
wasn't exactly to hot about going into another 
war to begin with and america is filled with many 
many races and creeds and religions...all important

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Fri Oct 25             DANNY HOWELLS (halloween bash)              Columbus

Friday 10/25 Rise
Col. Ohio
DJ Danny Howells

Rise Productions Proudly Presents:

Friday October 25:

The Midwest's largest Halloween Bash with:

(THIS GUY IS PICKED BY MANY IN THE INDUSTRY TO BE THE NEXT NUMBER 1 DJ IN 
THE WORLD. HE IS ALSO ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES. THIS IS A DO NOT MISS 
EVENT)

Danny Howells
Renaissance UK, Bullitt US
www.Dannyhowells.com

Special 4 hour set

There are very few DJs who stand out in the world of dance music today, 
but Danny Howells is without doubt one of them. From his early years of 
DJing at Bedrock nights in his home town of Hastings, to the 10+ hour sets 
in New York today, one thing remains the same - a complete love of all 
music. It's this passion and plenty of hard work that has helped Danny to 
get where he is today. It's no coincidence that he's been placed in DJ 
Magazine's top 20 DJs in the world for the last 3 years. Danny has a 
unique, eclectic sound which as been described as 
"deepsexyfuturistictechfunkhouse" and it's this sound which which is 
shaking floors worldwide. 

With over 12 years of experience, Danny has become truly international. 
His hectic schedule regularly takes him all over Europe, North and South 
America, Asia and Australia. He's DJed in the world's coolest clubs and 
held residencies at Renaissance, Twilo and Home. With 2002 came the 
announcement of an exciting monthly residency at Vinyl in New York, where 
Danny's 10 hour marathon sets are fast becoming legendary. 

It's not just in the club where Danny has made a name for himself, he's 
also been busy in the studio. Albums for Global Underground, Renaissance 
and his own Nocturnal Frequencies series have been the highlights in a 
continually growing back catalogue of acclaimed mixes. As a producer his 
main focus is with co-producer Dick Trevor and vocalist Erire as "Science 
Dept.". Last year they released the highly successful single "Breathe" and 
fans can expect more to follow in 2002. 

Danny's infectious personality and individual style is what really puts 
him a cut above the rest though. You can really sense his connection with 
the crowd wherever he plays, and he has fully earned the label "the 
clubbers DJ". 


The Halloween party is always one of the top nights of the year at Red 
Zone. 

Costumes are encouraged with many cash prizes given away. More details 
will be available soon.

combine quality house music with the power to move dance floors around the 
world. In the last few years, he's ignited crowds in the worlds best clubs 
such as Zouk in Singapore, Space in Miami, Twilo in New York, Pacha in 
Buenas aires and the mighty Space in Ibiza. Courtesy of home in the summer 
of 1999 and 2000, he provided the groundbreaking sets of the season for 
many of those lucky enough to hear him. Just after the first two months he 
had been crowned 'King Of Space' by the locals - a rare and well deserved 
honor. For over a year, Lawler set the capital alight with his weekly 
Friday night residency at Deepsouth at home. I f you were lucky enough to 
catch one of his 6 hour sets, you'll know exactly what it felt like as he 
weaved his magic across the club's sound system, wowing clubbers and 
critics alike. In Febuary2001, Steve decided to finish his stint at home 
due to overwhelming demand for his skills across the UK, and farther a 
field to the USA and the rest of Europe.

A veteran DJ for over 15 years, Donald Glaude has cemented his reputation 
as a crowd-rocking favorite and one of the most in demand artists in the 
country. He is one of those rare DJs who perceives their role to be that 
of an all-around entertainer and performer. He exudes energy, dropping 
track after funky track, arms aloft, and has been known to join the 
dancers on the floor. Join us at Rock the Bells 2 to witness the man DJ 
Dan considers "one of the most entertaining DJs in America to watch live."

people all over are playing his records. His blend of progressive and 
funky breaks will leave you in awe and wanting more, he flat out rocks the 
decks, and has done it in Dayton before.

many other 'zines, UFO! is one of the most sought after producers in the 
United States. Record labels across the country clamor for a UFO! remix, 
which guarantees a dance floor hit. A Bay Area native, UFO! pioneered the 
San Francisco Drum and Bass scene and co-founded the much respected 
Phunckateck collective, creating a new community in music. Now residing in

Spinning around the East Coast over the past few years has gained Charly 
the reputation for clean sets, crazy mixes, and an incredible vibe behind 
the decks. Headlining around the country with UFO!, Juan Atkins, DJ Seen, 
and AK1200, has earned, as well as provided, Charly immense respect. Once 
Charly is seen in action, it's easily understood why she has been touted 
to be the next best thing for the US Drum-n-Bass Scene. At the young age 
of only 18 she is sure to be the next superstar in drum and bass.

Trevor is one of the most respected and skilled DJs in the Midwest and is 
never to be missed as you might miss something spectacular. His experience

house music and break it down to its roots.vs.Samm-e ( Soulbrothaz, U.S. 
Hispanix, House Purists, Dr. Sun Prod, Senor MTSU ) Murfreesboro
Samm-e is one third of the nationally acclaimed Teamsters crew consisting

that comes over the room and with him on two while T is on two, things 
could get crazy, and memorable.

with Jumper by his side they always bring the house down. Guy can scratch 
with about any part of his body, and make sure you watch on November 30th

you all know he can rock it and let's show him how much we love him in 
Ohio. w/ Mc_Jumper ( GAG, Ruffneck Playaz Crew, www.neutralmusic.net )

remembered for a lifetime.

Clay is always bringing a new crate of records and a totally awesome 
performance to every event which keeps his sets fresh and new and the vibe 
totally flowing to the deep basslines and dirty beats that make up 
nu-skool breaks.
__________________________________________________

Foursqare ( Wishing Well, Metronomix ) Louisville
Last year around this time a dj was born to the scene to show everyone how 
to rock it, Foursqare style. The dope ass house sets she drops are enough 
to make people like Paul Johnson and other house legends say WHOA!!! 
__________________________________________________

e21 ( :SCENE:, Stellar Gruve ) Atlanta
The man behind SCENE Ohio made his first Wishing Well debut at the last 
Rock the Bells and rocking it this year will be no different. The trance 
selections he brings to the table are amazing and his attitude towards the 
music and his presence on stage show it all.
__________________________________________________

Nero_X ( Hypnotik Therapy ) Cincinnati
You thought you wouldn't hear the techno but what party is a party without 
techno. Get there early to hear this man bring it hard. Dino is an up and 
coming superstar in the Ohio scene so look out for him whenever you can.
__________________________________________________

Jigglypuff ( Independent ) Cincinnati
If you thought Guy Smilee was enough happy hardcore for the night you were 
totally mistaken because this guy will bring it in early to set the vibe 
and the night off on the right foot. Let the man we call Chester know how

What can I say? Sliced bread had a good, long run but now this is the best 
thing to hit the scene. If you miss this set you should be shot with many 
Fruit Pebbles until your bum is sore. The 80's pop and hardcore mixture 
will have you dancing on tables and screaming at the top of your lungs.

come all to one of the biggest toy for charity drives in Ohio.  Last year,
nearly 1400 people were in attenDANCE and with your help, we donated over
800 toys to charity in Dayton, Cincinnati, and Detroit.  This year we
expect to raise the bar even further with 6 headlining acts, Santa Claus
once again on the 1's and 2's spinning a sick-ass jungle set, NEW
HEADLINING TALENT, techno, trance, jungle, breaks, house, the chance to
get your picture taken with Santa, decorations, laser by Introspective,
banging sound by THUNDERSOUND, AND Bill-E performing a 3 hour live DRUM
set in the main room!  We promise your expectations will be exceeded and
your holiday will never be the same!  Like always, we pride ourselves in
bringing in new AND established talent - this time, we're just bringing
more!

***WINTER WONDERLAND 2***

DDR - London, United Kingdom (LIVE PA) - www.damndjs.com - Techno/Acid 
Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well 
as Stay Up Forever, Cluster and Choci's Chewns.  Whether you like trance 
house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno 
- Chris Anderson is one of those rare jacks-of-all-trades who has his hand 
in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic 
culture and if you like hard, techy, funky and acidic beats - look no 
further!

DJ Rip - Chicago, Illinois - Substance USA - www.fusedmanagement.com / 
www.djrip.com - Hard Progressive/Hard House - You know him, you love him 
and after last year's performance, we just had to bring him back. 
 Acclaimed DJ and respected Producer, Rip has brought the roof down all 
over the U.S. and Canada and on into Europe.  His production work includes 
works with Angel Alanis, Bam Bam, Alex Peace and more.  Rip is now taking 
his efforts to the next level moving his work into the progressive/tech 
area and he has been host of several Chicago area radio shows over time. 
 Without question he is a driving force bringing our Midwest culture to
the next level!

Vibe Raider & Urbane - Madison, Wisconsin - www.wellknowndjs.com - Drum &
Bass - These two MW females need no introduction!  Having rocked
throughout the Midwest and Canada together and separately, they have left
many a dancefloor in devastation.  With hard driving drum codes and wicked
bass lines, they will be performing a special hour and a half tag team
that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002 
WMC in Florida and had to bring her in to Ohio for her first appearance! 
 You won't want to miss this set!

Phuzze - Madison, Wisconsin - Trounce Records / www.poopiehead.net - Tech 
Trance - A fast rising star from the upper Midwest scene, Phuzze dropped a 
super-dope set at Bumpin & Jumpin 2 and we expect nothing but another 
hair-raising, hands in the air slam fest.  Playing out on both coasts and 
in Europe, you expect a refined set of some of the best uplifting tracks 
out there.

made his way from rock to electronic music hitting just about everything
in between.
 Be on the lookout for BiLL-E and Sundowner Syndrome in a town near you. 
 This acoustic drum set will be in the main room on a separate stage to
allow you to experience live drum circles during some of the main acts (it

hehe...as a source of creation...i often find new
events, songs, and dances replicating my actions
within milli-seconds.

it is eerie sometimes to be such a catalyst for
progress and creativity.

but then again did anyone figure that fractals
that were based on mathmatical random computer 
formula plots would create such beautiful art.

that is a true test of creativity to create art
out of chaos...but then again raves started as
the revamping of what was thought to be defunct 
warehouses...they were simply transformed into
temporary autonmous zones with visual and aura
stimulation effecting the mood...some chose to
use chemical mood enhancers also.

the basic pillars of rave: peace, love, unity,
and respect preserved the utopian rapture like
effect of raves until the sell-out haters and
posers came with their mainstream violence,
hate, disunity, and disrespect.

Subject: {pb-cle} extent of the damage as a result of the CIA hostile take-over of
    this list...

review of the extent of the damage as a result of the CIA
hostile take-over of this list...

* intentional oppression and defamation of character of a
  world leader...ruining my career and reputation, despite
  the 60 world solutions i had provided for free and the
  countless movies i had inspired without recieving any
  royalties whatsoever.
* malicious stereotyping of the largest race in the world.
* 10 million lay offs primarilly in the tech sector, mostly
  minorities, mostly asians.
* destruction of the underground scene and the destruction 
  of countless lives involved in the underground scene who 
  had gone bankrupt because of the CIA hate campaign.
* false propaganda citing the founding of the scene was
  based on drugs implicating minorities when in reality the 
  scene started pure and the drugs and the hate came from 
  the CIA because they were white supremists and drug
  traffickers!...minorities logically lacked the knowledge 
  or the capital to sythesize illegal drugs
* destroying world trade...shut down of the ports resulted
  in the loss of a billion dollars a day for union workers
  and foreign traders

for these obvious reasons any individuals involved in the
CIA or the FBI are being banned from the rapture/the scene.

"no caininites in the house of the lord of hosts..."

review of the extent of the damage as a result of the CIA
hostile take-over of this list...

* intentional oppression and defamation of character of a
  world leader...ruining my career and reputation, despite
  the 60 world solutions i had provided for free and the
  countless movies i had inspired without recieving any
  royalties whatsoever.
* malicious stereotyping of the largest race in the world.
* 10 million lay offs primarilly in the tech sector, mostly
  minorities, mostly asians.
* destruction of the underground scene and the destruction
  of countless lives involved in the underground scene who
  had gone bankrupt because of the CIA hate campaign.
* false propaganda citing the founding of the scene was
  based on drugs implicating minorities when in reality the
  scene started pure and the drugs and the hate came from
  the CIA because they were white supremists and drug
  traffickers!...minorities logically lacked the knowledge
  or the capital to sythesize illegal drugs
* destroying world trade...shut down of the ports resulted
  in the loss of a billion dollars a day for union workers
  and foreign traders

for these obvious reasons any individuals involved in the
CIA or the FBI are being banned from the rapture/the scene.

Be nice Chris. I remember a time when the same debate was going on about 
you. You popped off with some goofy, angsty stuff a number of times. You 
seem to have gotten over it and what not though. If you were "gone for good" 
as some people might have wanted, you couldn't get in fights on here no moe.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} R.O.M.10.24.02

*snip*
What this will consist of is an all out dance show down between Candy Kids
and Jungle Headz.......
*snip*

This reminds me of the best mix competition that was going on last year 
running all genres of music against each other. How does it get judged? 
Although most everyone can pick out a "really bad dancer" rating dancing is 
goofy to me.

I am totally stereotyping, but this made me think of a candied out pacifier 
sucking boy, with a silly pixie style haircut, limp-wristed left hand out to 
the side, bouncing around like the Energizer bunny on some basement 
crank...stepping up to some hard-corps jar-head looking guy who doesn't 
remember what smiling is for, let alone how to do it.

Sounds like a lot of fun, nevertheless.

I think I will probably go check out MM&W at M tonight though. I have heard 
some good stuff, but don't really know what to expect. Can anyone give me 
some clue as what sort of music they will have in store for us?

Thanks!

Improvisational jazz laced heavily with dirty funk. Lots of organ and heavy
on the bass. It sounds like stuff that the Beastie Boys would be sampling if
this were made in the 70's.

Sample some tracks from their latest album, "Uninvisible".

janetakaroofus@hotmail.com

someone should write to see how she's been... last time i knew i was still
on her blocked senders list...

sidenote funny of the day:
Last night drove past the Gay nightclub "Axis", they are redoing their front
parking lot and the sign out front says "No parking in the front, there is
plenty of parking in the rear"  I thought it was a brilliant ad campaign.

Subject: {pb-cle} Action Alert! Support HR 786

While we have been active in working to stop the RAVE act, there are 
other bills in congress that need our support!

Once such bill is HR 786. HR 786 seeks to repeal the provision in the 
Higher Education Act of 1998 that denies federal financial aid to any 
student convicted of a drug offense - even the most minor possession 
charge.

It is very important that we all support this bill - a bill in the 
right direction. And it's easy to let your voice be heard!

The ACLU has a ready to go letter at their take action site!:

http://ga1.org/campaign/hr786

Just go here, enter your info, and the letter will be sent to your 
congressman. It'll only take you a minute, but it's a minute well 
spent! Please help support ending discrimination toward recreational 
substance users!


Regards,

Andy Somers

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hallowbeatz- house party- Mt. Washington- hosted by KB- 11/02/02

On behalf of Will and myself, we wanted to apologize to Adam Ratana and the 
Life Support crew, as well as the Friction crew, and anyone else who may be 
having an event that Saturday (Nov. 2nd). Last thing we want to do is split 
up the crowd even more.

We encourage everyone to go to ALL of these events and then come to the 
Hallowbeatz house party! Or vice versa! Or, if you can teleport, be at all 
of these places at once!

Have fun this weekend everyone! I'm thinkin' about Hitting up Farina after 
work. I'll show up pretty late... but, good house = a tie and aviator 
sunglasses. A chance no respectable man (or woman) should pass up.

Peace!

paul (Do I get STP's for this?)

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} Anyone remember "Deeper" last year in Kent

To anyone who came to those last year feel free to stop into the old spot 
this Sat.  It will be Kents big halloween bash.  Anyone who was at the 
halloween party last year knows no one left there still walking straight.  
We plan to mix up another big batch of punch this year, byob to share 
though.  This isnt a party but an invitation for those of you who used to 
come to stop in visit for awhile.  Music will be provided by the CtN DJs.

okay you cheeseballs :)  my girl really really likes the track in the
newest mistubishi commercial. I know you were all just discussing it but I
wasn't paying attention, since I don't like it (but it is better than days
gone by, if I had to judge).

What's the deal?  artist, track name, label , when did it come out?

Hook it up. but only the full info.

French group....Telepopmusik is the name of the group...the song is called
Breathe, and if you want Adam, I'll send you the file later on tonight

you want to go get the rekkid.  It was released in 2002 on Chrysalis.

If you were looking for the record, here's what it looks like.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} newest mistubishi commercial

TELEPOPMUZIK - BREATHE

The mixes that came out on import really aren't that impressive - back
whenever they came out.

I saw a "one sheet" for new mixes comming out in the us next month - so
those will probably be more dancefloor orientated.

Subject: {pb-cle} New Mix CD - "A Love Letter" - djmoose

I've just put the finishing touches on a new mixed CD entitled, "A Love
Letter".

It can be streamed at: (64 kbps)
http://www.djmoose.com/music/love64.m3u

It can be downloaded at: (160 kbps)
http://www.weatherchem.com/maruscj/love160.mp3

Tracklisting and more info at:
http://www.djmoose.com/loveletter

The first half is groovy house, but the second half is a collection of my
favorite breaks tracks that I've been playing put but never got onto a CD.
Let me know what you guys think!

okay you cheeseballs :)  my girl really really likes the track in the
newest mistubishi commercial. I know you were all just discussing it but
I
wasn't paying attention, since I don't like it (but it is better than
days
gone by, if I had to judge).

What's the deal?  artist, track name, label , when did it come out?

Hook it up. but only the full info.

Some people had booked me for this party a while ago and never told me when i spin.  I have not seen my name on anything and when i have called there house they never  called back.  So unless some one gets back to me asap i will not be there.   You will be able to find me and my girl at a birthday party for a friend in Akron.                        Skillz

god you are just so lame

who fucking cares if someone busted on your or
not..you act like you need the approval of the people
on this list to be cool?!?!

you may not have done anything so outrightly stupid as
this, (which im not sure is even true, whatever) but i
believe your many statments, flames, and threats are
far greater than what this girl did..

Subject: {pb-cle} Roland Synth for sale

I am getting some new equiptment and have decided to sell my Roland JX-305
Groovesynth.  Its an excellent synth/groove-box made specifically for
creating dance music.
Versatile 'Dance-Centric' workstation, Great real-time control, easy to use
interface. And... It's not sold anymore!

 Comes with stand, manuals (good condition); it is missing the 9vdc power
supply, however I can get one at radio shack for about $10.

The synth is in perfect working conditions, it has 2 replacable knobs
missing and has some minor scratches to the paint near the bottom.

You can find out more specs at the following links:
Article: http://www.planet-groove.com/roland/jx-305.html
Spec Sheet: http://www.ishibashi.co.jp/namm/98namm-w/jx-305.htm
http://www.harmony-central.com/Newp/WNAMM98/Roland/JX-305.html

If interrested, I can get you more information and a picture.
I am asking $300 or best offer.

Sincerly,
g.r. Wolf

the dub mission airs every saturday night on 91.3 fm,
wyep pittsburgh, from 01:00 'til 05:00. listen live on
the web thru wyep.org as well.

tonight....

iphunk preview part 1, with guest dj's....

02:00-03:30 didi
03:30-05:00 wrecked!

~ to give you a small taste of what to expect @ the
upcoming innerchild event iphunk, the dub mission
presents 2 fine local talents, both spinning
commercial-free sets.

~ though, @ 2 AM the clocks are taken back to 1 AM, so
my guess is as good as yours if that'll mess things up
or not, guess we'll have to wait and see.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} THE BUMP GOT BUMPS


what ever happened to rick deshields?  Last time I saw him was family affair 
3 or something.  anyone got his contact info?  I had a tape he gave me and 
the tape sleve was the bump logo, probably a flier -> the tape is long since 
lost i think.  I thought it was funky alien gismos or something yet darwin 
named a different group, i think darwin said he had a part in bump too, or 
his friends, can't remember.

The flyer I really wish that I had I can't remember....  Maybe it was Tidal
Rave?   The flyer was actually a small box, like a mini cerial box.

Subject: {pb-cle} Mark Farina @ Groove last night...

Well, I thought it was about time for me to post an old fashioned review.

Place: Well I love Metropol.  I'm out there every week hanging out and
listening to good music.  Maybe now some of you people who never have been
there will want to come out more often.  It's a really nice space, clean,
great staff, great danceroom.

Music:  Mark Farina was awesome. The first half of his set wasn't exactly
what I was expecting.  It was a little less jazzy than it was housey, but
the last hour he tore the place up.  People were dancing like crazy.
I was also really digging Ted's set earlier in the evening, it was kinda
of dark and hard and I really liked it.  Over in Rosebud Smartie was
throwing down oldschool jams that made me giggle and then Clevr finished
the night off with some phat breaks (and boy was he concenrating).
All-in-all the music was top notch all around.

People:  I think the only thing that was better than the music was the
people.  A lot of people came out for this, and if you didn't you
completely missed out.  A lot of people who never come out graced us with
their appearance.  Lisa (my favorite bitch ever), Polarbear, Grampa Mesh,
Count Zer0, Bagina, Paul Fleetwood, Will, Ket, Dean, Mike Goldman, Dori,
Spike, Sean Alderman and so many others.  A lot of people went in costume
(including myself) and everyone was having a blast.  This is probably one
of the best times I've had since the Pb-Cle "Circle Jerk" at CDG2.

I just want to thank Tim and Ted for bringing in Farina, I (and a lot of
other people) really appreciated it.  Last night (in my opinion) was a
complete success and a definitely reminder that people in Pittsburgh
aren't dead, they've just been hibernating.

First I want to introduce myself.  My name is Kenny.  Dj name 
Sonic Impulse. 

Their was a lot of stuff that I have said,  done and did not realize everyone
who I affected by my actions.  This all started about two months back when I
was accused of slandering Matt Anderson's name on the PB Clev discussion 
forums.  Under the email kenny@transparentproduction.com Those post were not written by me in anyway and I'm very sorry that it did happen.  Many words have been exchange between me and Anderson sense this has occurred.  I used our website here at Transparent to make him look bad and not let people walk all over me.  Well this made my friends look bad along with the company and me.  So I want to say once again I'm sorry and I really would like to resolve things in a civilized matter without me and Anderson running around talking negative about each other.
Things have gotten way to carried away with everything that has happen.  So I'm being truthful as a mans word to offer my apologies and forgiveness to get these matters resolved  without things escalating and farther then they should have. 

Sincerely, 

Kenny
Sonic Impulse

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kid Koala

This is very cool... It's worth it just for the locals - Pureplex, Jugoe,
and Mistrerbradlep are all sweet! If your sitting at home tonight... don't.
There is an excessive amount of things to do in Ceveland tonight.  Saeed &
Palash is @ Moda, Lego is @ Mercury Lounge, and the Kitty Kat Ball is @ Spy
(where I will be).

First I want to introduce myself.  My name is Kenny.  Dj name 
Sonic Impulse. 

Their was a lot of stuff that I have said,  done and did not realize 
everyone who I affected by my actions.  This all started about two 
months back when I was accused of slandering Matt Anderson's name on 
the PB Clev discussion forums.  Those post were not written by me in 
anyway and I'm very sorry that it did happen.  Many words have been 
exchange between me and Anderson sense this has occurred.  I used our 
website here at Transparent to make him look bad and not let people 
walk all over me.  Well this made my friends look bad along with the 
company and me.  So I want to say once again I'm sorry and I really 
would like to resolve things in a civilized matter without me and 
Anderson running around talking negative about each other. Things have 
gotten way to carried away with everything that has happen.  So I'm 
being truthful as a mans word to offer my apologies and forgiveness to
get these matters resolved  without things escalating and farther then 
they should have.

What OS are you running? I think I need to downgrade my os so that it
doesnt split recordings into tracks. I already downgraded it from 2.96 to
2.95 but now recording doesnt seem to work.. doh.  It came w/ the latest
one installed, which sucks.  It wouldnt be so bad if there was a way to
merge the split tracks. dou you know of a way, please reply privately.
thanks,

Subject: {pb-cle} kid koala review

everybody that slept on kid koala missed something spectacular last night.  
hopefully you were either at mercury or moda instead of sittin on the couch 
complaining that there's nothing to do.  anyway...

venue: i have always loved the grog shop, and have seen more bands there 
than i can count.  this is the first time i have seen a dj set there, so it 
was an interesting comparison.  the stage was nice, everybody could get a 
great view of the djs.  sound was decent in the areas around the stage and 
directly in front if it (where most of the crowd was) but at the bar and 
over by the jukebox you couldn't really hear anything except for a tinny 
low-end.

crowd: lots of heads there that i haven't seen in awhile, which is always 
good.  people came out of the woodwork for this one.  it was crowded, but 
not too crowded; i thought there was an almost perfect amount of people 
there.

kid koala: totally amazing.  3 tts, 2 ranes, and a bag and a crate of crazy 
records.  an incomplete list of some of the artists he used: public enemy, 
cypress hill, dead or alive, tears for fears, bjork, radiohead, kermit the 
frog, those 2 old guys from the muppet show(stadler and waldorf), the cure, 
de la soul, outkast, oingo boingo, tride called quest, and the breakfast at 
tiffany's soundtrack.  sick crabs, tweaks, needle dropping, and transforms 
galore.  he did a 5 minute rendition of "drunk trumpeter" which was 
incredible!  he was talking to the crowd, showed pictures from his new book, 
and hammed it up with actually mixing a series of 5 80s records together, 
having the crowd sing along and stuff.  all in all, he played for about 90 
minutes, and then ended with a brand-new routine he called the "audrey 
hepburn beat juggle" wherein he did just that, juggled the soundtrack from 
breakfast at tiffany's.  the crowd did not know whether to clap or sit there 
in awe!

verdict: one of the most incredible music experiences i've ever had, thanks 
to the grog shop and everybody who made this happen.

In my high school English class if we misused the word "there" in a

the vibe at M was rocken.  ferina was a good time, he's all i heard i rolled in alittle late cause i worked.  i was alittle sad that it cleared out so fast but the troopers who stuck in there till the end was awsome!  the only nitch i have is the set got little messy for a bit.  i'm woundering if it was the tables or what????  i was waiting for the chic on roller skates to fall over them which would of made the night even more fun.  seeing that she kept running into the blown up pumpkins.  who's idea was that for her to be up there???????  good conversation piece however.. everyone was on the buzz with that one.  it was great seeing alot of the old kids whom i even thought retired for life, but i'm sure people thought the same of me.  it's nice to roll in and out of the scene and catching up with old friends with the old drama and with out getting invovled with the new drama.
peace kiddies  peace

This is without the soon-to-be-recorded vocals, and without the possible-piano/synth solo, but here's the basic idea I've been working with:

Lemme know what ya think.  I've never made anything under 137bpm before, and that was only once.  I usually hang out in the 145-165 range.  :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Something to do...second attempt

Think this got bounced because some portion of an earlier thread mentioned a 
certain conspiracy theorist whose name is in a kill file. If this is a 
repost, please disregard.

ORIGINAL FOLLOWS:

I know that there is a pretty good amount of stuff to do in Pittsburgh on 
the weekends, and that some venues are better suited to certain 
personalities. First of all, I want to mention that this is 21 and over. No 
need getting you interested in something you can't do

Anyway, there is a group called the Telefonics from Erie, who I really dig. 
They have a sound that is difficult for me to describe. Its indy rock. 
They've got the standard guitar, bass, and drum kit. What blows me away 
though, is Gina the front woman. She's this hot brunette with a decent voice 
and a good stage presence. She is still a little self-conscious about 
performing in front of a crowd, but she does a really good job. The big 
kicker is that she plays a Theremin that is running through a Kaos touch-pad 
effects processor. Evidently she just got some new toys to plug in to it as 
well.

If you don't know, a Theremin is this instrument invented in the 30s (pretty 
sure about the time period) that the musician doesn't touch. There are two 
metal rods on opposite ends of a wooden box at waist height. One is 
vertically oriented, the other horizontally oriented. Distance of the 
musician's hand from one rod adjusts pitch while the other hand adjusts 
volume. It is conceptually similar to the way a guitar's strings work 
against frets. It was used in a LOT of 50s sci-fi movies for that "spooky" 
sound. I think probably the most famous application of it, is the instrument 
making that weird sound in the Beach Boys song "Good Vibrations"

The show is going to be in Polish Hill at Gooski's on Brereton Ave. This is 
basically a dive bar with real good prices on food and alcohol, excellent 
jukebox, and an ecclectic mix of patrons. I guess it caters to the dice and 
flames crowd, local rock scene hipsters, with a healthy infusion of emo punk 
rockers, a number of young professionals, and a sprinkling of the local 
clique including fairly unassuming "good ole boys."

People get swilly up in this place. So if you're uptight about events with 
alcohol, or do that silly little gaggy cough when someone is smoking a 
cigarette near you, don't bother coming out. If this seems like a place you 
might like, please come out. I'd love to get a chance to meet some of you 
that I haven't, and you just might be finding a place that you enjoy. Its 
usually like $3, maybe $4. I will try to find the exact price if anyone is 
interested.

Okay, I sure can run my mouth a lot. I STOP NOW.

Subject: {pb-cle} kool keith question

i normally wouldn't go about asking this question on a mailing list such as
this because its just not professional, but due to certain circumstances i
would appreciate some feedback.  please reply privately with a 'yes' or
'no'.

would you come to columbus to see kool keith (dr. octagon/black elvis) and
zion-i for about $15 at an intimate, well respected concert venue?

That's what I was afraid of.

Another great DJ in the city that I've missed.

Congrats, Tim & Ted. It may be a bitch to get some of these guys in the

Well, I thought it was about time for me to post an old fashioned review.

Place: Well I love Metropol.  I'm out there every week hanging out and
listening to good music.  Maybe now some of you people who never have been
there will want to come out more often.  It's a really nice space, clean,
great staff, great danceroom.

Music:  Mark Farina was awesome. The first half of his set wasn't exactly
what I was expecting.  It was a little less jazzy than it was housey, but
the last hour he tore the place up.  People were dancing like crazy.
I was also really digging Ted's set earlier in the evening, it was kinda
of dark and hard and I really liked it.  Over in Rosebud Smartie was
throwing down oldschool jams that made me giggle and then Clevr finished
the night off with some phat breaks (and boy was he concenrating).
All-in-all the music was top notch all around.

People:  I think the only thing that was better than the music was the
people.  A lot of people came out for this, and if you didn't you
completely missed out.  A lot of people who never come out graced us with
their appearance.  Lisa (my favorite bitch ever), Polarbear, Grampa Mesh,
Count Zer0, Bagina, Paul Fleetwood, Will, Ket, Dean, Mike Goldman, Dori,
Spike, Sean Alderman and so many others.  A lot of people went in costume
(including myself) and everyone was having a blast.  This is probably one
of the best times I've had since the Pb-Cle "Circle Jerk" at CDG2.

I just want to thank Tim and Ted for bringing in Farina, I (and a lot of
other people) really appreciated it.  Last night (in my opinion) was a
complete success and a definitely reminder that people in Pittsburgh
aren't dead, they've just been hibernating.

Subject: {pb-cle} Mark Farina Groove Pictures

Well I have been waiting almost 5 years to see
Mark Farina come to this area. But it Ended up
being some kind of a cursed night for me. We
didn't get to the club till 1:30 because of a
friend being late. I drove over 400 miles round
trip. On the way home Saturday morning I ended up
getting a flat tire on my car that's only 3 Mos.
old. But I still had fun the little short time I
was there:)

Subject: {pb-cle} Anyone going to Xtreme monster ball thursday?

was listening to 92.3's Ultrasound thing and 92.3 is sponsoring an 
event at Metropolis thursday that's $5.  Going to bring in Brian Beck 

who does the Ultrasound show and is going to be doing an extended set 

(based off what he plays on the show, he mainly does house).  No real 

information on anyone else or anything.  Might be interesting just to 

see all the people walking around asking for drugs and stuff thinking 

that's what they do at a party since that's what the media says you 
do at these.  Haven't been anywhere for a while and it seems like 
there's a few cheap parties happening thursday (anyone going to one 
in Canton?, think that's $3 for 21+ and $5 for 18+)

:i: know this has drug references, but at least I didn't say e..... 
crap...

I concur.  I was thinking the same thing and was just about to post that
even before reading the other parts of the thread.

Sounds like you sampled the NES direct.

Sounds a little to "happy" for my current mood, though.  I guess it's just
me :)

electroclash is now my most ripped on genre. its taken over from 
poppunk, emo, prog house, trance, uk hardhouse, and white emcees. 
thats really way too sad.

Subject: {pb-cle} Miss Liberty

An Anniversary Worth Celebrating
    
    by Harry Browne

Today, Monday, October 28th, should be a national 
holiday.

In addition to being my wife's birthday, it is the 
anniversary of the dedication of the Statue of 
Liberty in 1886.

As with most parts of American history, very few 
Americans are aware of the Statue's background.

It was a gift from the French people to the 
American people. And when I say, "French people," 
I mean it. It wasn't paid for with French taxes; 
the money was raised through voluntary donations, 
given freely by French people as a token of 
friendship to the United States.

Why would they do that?

Because _at that time_ the United States was truly 
unique. It was the one country in the world where 
individual liberty was prized far above "national 
greatness." And it was the one major country that 
didn't embroil itself in the endless wars the 
European people were so used to.

    How Times Change

In the 1880s, people all over the world looked to 
America for inspiration. Its very existence was 
proof that it was possible to have a relatively 
free and peaceful country. No income tax, no 
foreign wars, no welfare state, no intrusions on 
civil liberties.

Of course, that's no longer the case. We now have 
all those things -- and more. And, worse yet, most 
Americans have come to accept them as necessary 
evils. Government schools make no attempt to show 
children that it wasn't always this way -- that it 
doesn't have to _be_ this way.

    Liberty Alone

When the Statue arrived in the U.S., Americans 
donated the money -- again, voluntarily -- to build 
the pedestal and assemble the Statue on Bedloe's 
Island in New York Harbor. 

The great monument isn't called the Statue of the 
World's Superpower, or the Statue of National 
Greatness, or the Statue of the World's Policeman. 
Because individual liberty was America's one 
possession so prized by others, the monument was 
named the Statue of Liberty. 

It is an impressive sight. Notice that Lady 
Liberty faces outward -- toward the world, not 
toward America. With her torch held high, she is 
reaching out to the world as the symbol of liberty 
-- bringing light and inspiration to people 
everywhere. 

    The Statue's Message

At the time of her creation, she was saying:

 "Whoever you are, wherever you are, if you can 
  just get to America, you can be free. No matter 
  what your station where you are now, you'll be 
  equal before the law here.

 "No one will ask for your papers. 

 "No one will fasten a number on you. 

 "No one will extort a percentage of your income 
  as the price of earning a living. 

 "You'll be free to pursue the life you've always 
  dreamed of."

Emma Lazarus summed it up in those lovely words 
that are inscribed on the base of the Statue:

  Give me your tired, your poor,
  Your huddled masses yearning to be free,
  The wretched refuge of your teeming shore.
  Send these -- the homeless, tempest-tossed 
   -- to me.
  I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door.

That is the America we once had -- the beacon of 
liberty, providing light and hope and inspiration 
to the entire world -- the America we have forsaken 
for a mess of tasteless pottage.

That is the America we _should_ have.

And I am determined that it is the America we will 
someday have again.

Harry Browne is Director of Public Policy for 
American Liberty Foundation. American Liberty 
Foundation seeks to be a beacon of liberty, 
an organization committed to mass marketing 
and popularization of libertarian ideals. If 
you like what you've just read, we hope you'll
choose to join us and demonstrate your support.

Subject: {pb-cle} Wednesday at Fuze

KC and Tik-Tak will be off the Hizzy!

Sick, sick, sick. Waahooo!



"These guys are cool; and by cool, I mean totally sweet."


Facts:
1. KC and Tik-Tak are mammals.
2. KC and Tik-Tak fight ALL the time.
3. The purpose of KC and Tik-Tak is to flip out and kill people.

KC and Tik-Tak can kill anyone they want! KC and Tik-Tak cut off heads ALL 
the time and don't even think twice about it. These guys are so crazy and 
awesome that they flip out ALL the time. I heard that there was this DJ who 
was spinning at a diner.  And when some dude dropped a record KC and Tik-Tak 
killed the whole town.  My friend Mark said that he saw KC and Tik-Tak 
totally uppercut some kid just because the kid opened a window.

If you don't believe that KC and Tik-Tak have REAL Ultimate Power you better 
get a life right now or they will chop your head off!!!  It's an easy 
choice, if you ask me.

Subject: {pb-cle} Anyone going to Xtreme monster ball thursday?

was listening to 92.3's Ultrasound thing and 92.3 is sponsoring an 
event at Metropolis thursday that's $5.  Going to bring in Brian Beck 
who does the Ultrasound show and is going to be doing an extended set 
(based off what he plays on the show, he mainly does house).  No real 
information on anyone else or anything.  Might be interesting just to 
see all the people walking around asking for drugs and stuff thinking 
that's what they do at a party since that's what the media says you 
do at these.  Haven't been anywhere for a while and it seems like 
there's a few cheap parties happening thursday (anyone going to one 
in Canton?, think that's $3 for 21+ and $5 for 18+)

:i: know this has drug references, but at least I didn't say e..... 
crap...

Subject: {pb-cle} Ecstasy and Viagra mentioned in November's GQ

Haha, this is pure class.  I'm typing this up from the magazine.  GQ is great.  (I've had a subscription to them since 1990, and my uncle (Terry Rafferty) switched from doing 
movie reviews for the New Yorker to them in 1998)

(I wanna write em and tell em the name my friend Dave came up with for this combo: "Stiffy-flippin'", lol)


>From the Dr. Sooth section (a sex advice column of sorts, very graphic, usually)

------------------

Q:  A friend of mine turned me onto a combo of pills that has resulted in the best sex of my life: Viagra and ecstasy.  I can go for hours, and my orgasms are mindblowing.  
Lately, my erections go on a little longer than I'd like, though, and begiin to hurt.  Plus, I get bad headaches, but I can't bring myself to go cold turkey.  The trade-off seems 
worth it, but should I be worried?


A:  Since it was introduced four years ago, that little blue pill has been a godsend for some and a boatload of pain for others - at least when it's used recklessly.  Gulping Viagra 
has become a club pastime, especially when mixed with drugs like amyl nitrate, speed, and ecstasy.  (Your particular combo plate is known as sexstasy.)  In Miami people call 
taking sexstasy "hammerheading", for the throbbing headache that usually follows.

Yes, you should be worried.  A marathon erection can land you in the emergency room, for starters.  At least several cases of priaparism (a long-lasting erection in which the 
blood in your erect penis cannot circulate, and becomes sludge-like) have been associated with this little cocktail.  Drugs can act in concert with one another, exacerbating a 
medical problem - both Viagra and amyl nitrate, for example, lower your blood pressure.  If you happen to have a heart attack while you're on this stuff, look out below.

Further, Viagra plus inhibition-freeing ecstasy equals a peripatetic penis.  Wandering wood results in reckless sex and potential diseases and other unwanted difficulties.

You say you can't seem to stop, yet surely you know that if you can't do the deed without chemical backup, you have a problem.  See your doctor if you can't physically kick 
it; see a sex therapist if you're mentally dependent on it.  And remember: Not every woman likes to be drilled continuously for hours by a human woodpecker!


---------------

Haha, funny stuff.  I've never done this personally, just cause Viagra scares me, and I don't really feel the need to try.  ;)  However, it does sound somewhat intriguing.  
Anyway, regarding the article, I thought it was interesting that they went on and on about how dangerous Viagra is, but didn't mention anything on E either way; which seems 
rather odd, but since GQ isn't one to get tied up with media hype and BS, it makes sense.  I consider Viagra WAY more dangerous than E personally...more people have died 
from Viagra in 4 years than the amount of people that have died from Ecstasy in the what, 30+ years, its been being used for?  Anyway, interesting shit.

:)

Paul, do not fuck with DJ Entropy. Go to his site and check out some of his
hardcore tracks...this dude is the real fuckin' deal.

I want to throw a party solely to have an excuse to bring this man to
Pittsburgh...

Speaking of which, Ian, do you remember talking about a halloween hardcore
track...I think you sent a link to it...do you remember what it is/was, and
do you still have it??

I wonder how many of the viagra related deaths were old guys wankin it (ala 
"Clerks").  :P I bet the demographics of the typical viagra user just 
INVITES death on the drug.  Hell, i'm sure most of those old guys hadn't 
gotten wood in years prior... i'd probably have a heart attack too!

Subject: {pb-cle} "Rebirth" Thanks

Control the Night and Quantum Bass would like to thank everyone who came out 
and packed the place last night.  The vibe was awesome and DB was so 
impressed by everyone that he offered to come out regularly and play.  Thank 
to Jeah Leigh, Metroid and Snyper for dropping phenomenal sets. I hope to 
see you all out next week.

the music when it is set there by itself, without the video game
seems to lack a lot of it's appeal

so for instance if I was watching an animation of a
bouncing italian plumber, jumping in some
sort of rhythm to your track , I might enjoy it more

here's an idea, vido games are a sort of
digital instrument, where the gamer
creates music by interacting with the video game

i have this tape i made when i was like 8 or 9 where i just went
through every nintendo game i owned and beat them, and then used a

Subject: {pb-cle} News:  Jam Master Jay was killed tonight.

I know its not really rave related, but early run dmc had a huge impact on
me and I thought I would share.

Peace

We regret to inform you that the legendary DJ Jam Master Jay (Jason Mizell)
of Run DMC, was killed in Jamaica, Queens, tonight at a recording studio.
The
news anchor reported that he appears to have died from a single shot to the
head. The anchor also said that the police investigation to find out what
really happened could go well into the morning.  A 25 yr. old man was shot
in
the leg. Jam Master Jay was only 37. He will be sorely missed by the Hip Hop
community.  We would like to express our condolences to his family, friends,
affiliates and fans. He won't be forgotten.

Sincerely
Christie Z- and Fabel Pabon

This is the only website that seemed the most official for Run DMC news. God
willing, you can check this site for more information as it's available.

Afrika Bambaataa for alerted us to this news after he heard it on the radio.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} my first shot at an Electroclash tune, so far

Moonwalker for the Sega Genesis owned.

I fucking saved Annie about ten thousand times in that game.

Good thing sparkels shot out of my feet when I did a stylish leg thrust. Not 
to mention I could morph into a car.

I am big.

P.S.: The music owned. Smooth Criminal is one of the best tunes ever.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Thu Nov 21            SYMBIOSIS: Live Art/Music Auction     Antioch College

"Symbiosis: Live Art/Music Auction"
Thursday, November 21st - 6pm until 2am
Birch Space @ Antioch College - 450 Corry St, Yellow Springs, Oh 45387

Symbiosis, defined in biological terms, is a mutually beneficial
relationship that exists between two or more organisms living in close
proximity or contact. You are cordially invited to witness as both
students and faculty from Antioch College create their own manifestations
of symbiosis in artistic terms - a stunning interaction between art and
music. The art and music are performances themselves, the spontaneous
creation of various mediums of art simultaneous to both live and DJ
musical performances encompassing a broad range of music.

At the end of each performance, an auction will be held that provides the
rare opportunity for the audience to acquire both the original art and
recordings of the music that was just experienced. All proceeds will
directly benefit the Performing Arts Committee at Antioch College.

Of Art:
Professor Chris Garcia (ceramics & sculpture)
Ally Adduci (oils)
Sara Duda (acrylics)
Erin Ford (ceramics)

Bio:
Steve Lawler is a definitive DJ and producer: a tastemaker whose sets 
combine quality house music with the power to move dance floors around the 
world. In the last few years, he's ignited crowds in the worlds best clubs 
such as Zouk in Singapore, Space in Miami, Twilo in New York, Pacha in 
Buenas aires and the mighty Space in Ibiza. Courtesy of home in the summer 
of 1999 and 2000, he provided the groundbreaking sets of the season for 
many of those lucky enough to hear him. Just after the first two months he 
had been crowned 'King Of Space' by the locals - a rare and well deserved 
honor. For over a year, Lawler set the capital alight with his weekly 
Friday night residency at Deepsouth at home. I f you were lucky enough to 
catch one of his 6 hour sets, you'll know exactly what it felt like as he 
weaved his magic across the club's sound system, wowing clubbers and 
critics alike. In Febuary2001, Steve decided to finish his stint at home 
due to overwhelming demand for his skills across the UK, and farther a 
field to the USA and the rest of Europe.

"Rock the Bells 2, The Second Ringing" featuring the following djs and/or 
acts........


Donald_Glaude ( Moonshine Records, Eden Records ) Los Angeles, California
A veteran DJ for over 15 years, Donald Glaude has cemented his reputation 
as a crowd-rocking favorite and one of the most in demand artists in the 
country. He is one of those rare DJs who perceives their role to be that 
of an all-around entertainer and performer. He exudes energy, dropping 
track after funky track, arms aloft, and has been known to join the 
dancers on the floor. Join us at Rock the Bells 2 to witness the man DJ 
Dan considers "one of the most entertaining DJs in America to watch live." 
__________________________________________________

Huge Surprise Orlando Breaks dj to be announced seconds before he takes 
stage. This guy has accomplished many things in the breaks world and 
people all over are playing his records. His blend of progressive and 
funky breaks will leave you in awe and wanting more, he flat out rocks the 
decks, and has done it in Dayton before.
__________________________________________________

UF0_! ( Phunkatech Records, Phylum Recordings, Circa ) New York City
Featured in magazines such as URB, XLR8R, Lotus, Mixmag, Knowledge, and 
many other 'zines, UFO! is one of the most sought after producers in the 
United States. Record labels across the country clamor for a UFO! remix, 
which guarantees a dance floor hit. A Bay Area native, UFO! pioneered the 
San Francisco Drum and Bass scene and co-founded the much respected 
Phunckateck collective, creating a new community in music. Now residing in 
New York City he is rocking more crowds then ever.
__________________________________________________

Charly ( Bassdrive, Well Known Djs ) Philadelphia
Spinning around the East Coast over the past few years has gained Charly 
the reputation for clean sets, crazy mixes, and an incredible vibe behind 
the decks. Headlining around the country with UFO!, Juan Atkins, DJ Seen, 
and AK1200, has earned, as well as provided, Charly immense respect. Once 
Charly is seen in action, it's easily understood why she has been touted 
to be the next best thing for the US Drum-n-Bass Scene. At the young age 
of only 18 she is sure to be the next superstar in drum and bass.
__________________________________________________

Trevor_Lamont ( NateFx, Soulbrothaz, Aliensquad ) Lexington KY
Trevor is one of the most respected and skilled DJs in the Midwest and is 
never to be missed as you might miss something spectacular. His experience 
reflects on his sets as he can always work the crowd with his soulful 
house music and break it down to its roots.vs.Samm-e ( Soulbrothaz, U.S. 
Hispanix, House Purists, Dr. Sun Prod, Senor MTSU ) Murfreesboro
Samm-e is one third of the nationally acclaimed Teamsters crew consisting 
of him, Halo, and Trevor Lamont. When he hits the decks there is a vibe 
that comes over the room and with him on two while T is on two, things 
could get crazy, and memorable.
__________________________________________________

Guy_Smilee ( www.gagproductions.com, www.neutralmusic.net ) Rochester, New 
York
Guy Smilee is one of the most popular happy hardcore djs in the US and 
with Jumper by his side they always bring the house down. Guy can scratch 
with about any part of his body, and make sure you watch on November 30th 
as you can see him in action. Like I said Jumper will be by his side and 
you all know he can rock it and let's show him how much we love him in 
Ohio. w/ Mc_Jumper ( GAG, Ruffneck Playaz Crew, www.neutralmusic.net ) 
Rochester, New York
__________________________________________________

Big Regional Surprise Act to close out the main room and rock it for an 
hour. These guys have been ripping it for a year now and have been ripping 
it all together for about 2 years. They made their debut last year on 
December 15th and will be closing out the main room at 5 with a set to be 
remembered for a lifetime.
__________________________________________________

Kid Chaos ( In the Groove, Infinity Prod )
This house music enthusiast is always a hit on the dancefloor. His fusion 
of disco house and groovy tech-house has helped him gain recognition 
throughout the midwest and get him on lineups with names such as Too 
Short, Sandra Collins, and more.
__________________________________________________

HE10 ( In The Groove ) Tucson, Arizona
Coming to us all the way from Tucson he is ready to throw down the dopest 
uplifting trance we have seen in a long time. The awesome track selection 
and flawless mixing will bring him back to our city more often, hopefully.
__________________________________________________

Mike_Donovan ( Bounce Theory, Scarab Records ) Dayton, Ohio
Mike is co-founder of the Bounce Theory in Dayton Ohio. Deep tech-house 
music for the sophisticated listener featuring smooth, deep, jazzy 
grooves. He will be promoting his new cd Paint the Town Redd so be close 
to the decks and you might get a copy.
__________________________________________________

Chromix_live pa ( Groovefuel Recordings, Do:Loop Records ) Cleveland
This Northern Ohio progressive and hard trance producing phenomenon has 
been writing tracks since the age of 15. His unique and powerful live set 
will leave you begging for more and make sure you watch out for his first 
release on Groovefuel Recordings later this year.
__________________________________________________

Matthew_Kelly ( 4-Score Productions, Katatonic Resident ) Nashville
This crazy scratching breaks master representing Nashville will make his 
first Wishing Well appearance and a long awaited one at that. Make sure to 
catch his set as his whole crew including Michelle make it up from 
Nashvegas.
__________________________________________________

Clay-Born ( Wishing Well, Breakline Crew ) Louisville
Clay is always bringing a new crate of records and a totally awesome 
performance to every event which keeps his sets fresh and new and the vibe 
totally flowing to the deep basslines and dirty beats that make up 
nu-skool breaks.
__________________________________________________

Foursqare ( Wishing Well, Metronomix ) Louisville
Last year around this time a dj was born to the scene to show everyone how 
to rock it, Foursqare style. The dope ass house sets she drops are enough 
to make people like Paul Johnson and other house legends say WHOA!!! 
__________________________________________________

e21 ( :SCENE:, Stellar Gruve ) Atlanta
The man behind SCENE Ohio made his first Wishing Well debut at the last 
Rock the Bells and rocking it this year will be no different. The trance 
selections he brings to the table are amazing and his attitude towards the 
music and his presence on stage show it all.
__________________________________________________

Nero_X ( Hypnotik Therapy ) Cincinnati
You thought you wouldn't hear the techno but what party is a party without 
techno. Get there early to hear this man bring it hard. Dino is an up and 
coming superstar in the Ohio scene so look out for him whenever you can.
__________________________________________________

Jigglypuff ( Independent ) Cincinnati
If you thought Guy Smilee was enough happy hardcore for the night you were 
totally mistaken because this guy will bring it in early to set the vibe 
and the night off on the right foot. Let the man we call Chester know how 
much we love him and be right next to the decks when he throws down.
__________________________________________________

Def_Leper ( Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids ) Dayton
What can I say? Sliced bread had a good, long run but now this is the best 
thing to hit the scene. If you miss this set you should be shot with many 
Fruit Pebbles until your bum is sore. The 80's pop and hardcore mixture 
will have you dancing on tables and screaming at the top of your lungs.

***WINTER WONDERLAND 2***

DDR - London, United Kingdom (LIVE PA) - www.damndjs.com - Techno/Acid 
Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well 
as Stay Up Forever, Cluster and Choci's Chewns.  Whether you like trance 
house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno 
- Chris Anderson is one of those rare jacks-of-all-trades who has his hand 
in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic 
culture and if you like hard, techy, funky and acidic beats - look no 
further!

DJ Rip - Chicago, Illinois - Substance USA - www.fusedmanagement.com / 
www.djrip.com - Hard Progressive/Hard House - You know him, you love him 
and after last year's performance, we just had to bring him back. 
 Acclaimed DJ and respected Producer, Rip has brought the roof down all 
over the U.S. and Canada and on into Europe.  His production work includes 
works with Angel Alanis, Bam Bam, Alex Peace and more.  Rip is now taking 
his efforts to the next level moving his work into the progressive/tech 
area and he has been host of several Chicago area radio shows over time. 
 Without question he is a driving force bringing our Midwest culture to
the next level!

Vibe Raider & Urbane - Madison, Wisconsin - www.wellknowndjs.com - Drum &
Bass - These two MW females need no introduction!  Having rocked
throughout the Midwest and Canada together and separately, they have left
many a dancefloor in devastation.  With hard driving drum codes and wicked
bass lines, they will be performing a special hour and a half tag team
that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002 
WMC in Florida and had to bring her in to Ohio for her first appearance!

hair-raising, hands in the air slam fest.  Playing out on both coasts and 
in Europe, you expect a refined set of some of the best uplifting tracks 
out there.

Mon Dec 23                         ARRIVAL                           Toledo

GlassCity Records Presents:
*Arrival*
Monday, December 23rd 2002
Toledo, Ohio
Robert Armani - Chicago - Techno - High Octane

When you put the words "Chicago" and "Techno" together one man comes to
mind, Robert Armani! The south side "Crown Royal Funksta" has been a
techno staple for the last decade and his discography puts him in a league
all his own. On his first trip to spin in Italy he realized his true
calling while studying to be a Chicago Police officer (we almost lost
him). Just the mention of "Blow It Out", "Burn Out", "Big Dick", "Playing
With a Rubber Band", "Ambulance", and, of course, "Circus Bells", brings
back memories of dancing to them over the past ten years at rave parties
and in clubs all around the world. Dance Mania, ACV, Dust Traxx,
Djax-Up-Beats, and High Octane are the labels where his music has been
released and his remixes of JB3 (Joey Beltram), Paul Johnson, Dave Clarke,
Blake Baxter, Armando, and even Gary Numan have elevated him to the
highest of heights. With sixteen full length album releases and over sixty
single releases it has been hard to avoid Mr. Armani's work while flippin'
through any techno bin. His relentless tour schedule has him on the road
non-stop and his hard hitting, dirty, Chicago Techno has rocked clubs
since his early days of spinning. This is a man of Techno royalty and we
are happy to live under his reign.

Translucent - Chicago - House/Techno - Transparent, DTX 

Translucent, also known as Jason Torres, has been playing and studying
music for over sixteen years. Having been influenced by jazz artists such
as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Charlie Parker, Jason started playing
the trumpet and piano at a young age. His dedication to music earned him a
full jazz scholarship to the prestigious Roosevelt University in Chicago
where, in 1994, he was influenced by another style of music known as House
Music. Jason then began DJing and started something new and fresh in the
dance community: playing live trumpet while spinning records, combining
the elements of live jazz with electronic music. Noticing that Jason had
something special, Paul Johnson, the creator of the gold record "Get, Get
Down," helped Jason create connections in Chicago. Since then, Translucent
has played live trumpet with such greats as Derrick Carter, Timo Maas,
Mark Farina, Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr., Glenn Underground,
Cajmere, Boo Williams, Carlos, and Halo. Recent recording projects include
Glenn Underground's new album on Guidance, work with Derrick Carter on
classic, and Gene Farris on Fluential.

Tonight @ "Lets Have A Haunted House" I will be doing a special set to honor the memory of Jam Master Jay from 2-3. As a champion of old school hip hop I am deeply affected by the loss of Jam Master Jay. He had a HUGE impact on the way I developed as a DJ and a musician. Please come out tonight and share with me in a tribute to his greatest works. This one's for you brother... i will miss you.   

-- 
We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.

Yeah, after I sent that, i realize that the artist name was in the little
Real Player scroll window.

It's certainly different from the original...I like the beat a lot. I don't
know that I'd want to pay $10 plus shipping for it...

But then again, I play house, so it wouldn't exactly fit either...But yeah,
it's tight. One of the more imaginative breaks tracks I've heard lately...

Subject: {pb-cle} Wednesday at BBT

I may have been a little over zealous the other day when talking about the 
BBT. I guess I was not fully aware of how Kevin Cunningham and Tik-Tak's 
style has been evolving. It was not quite what I expected, although there 
was some great music overall and a very lively crowd.

Thanks for putting the Wednesday night thing together. Its a good night.

I just found out last night that my dad has lung cancer. It's slow =

surgery, hopefully, in a couple weeks to remove part of one of his =
lungs. If all goes well, that'll be it, but if not, and it spreads, =
well...

Could some of you who know me keep him in your thoughts, and if you're =
at all religious, keep him in your prayers.

Subject: {pb-cle} HallowBeatz house party reminder 11/2

Hey all just a quick reminder that the house party is this sat night
(11/2/02).

There is info in events section on lolli
(http://lolli.org/aspcalendar/events.asp?date=11/2/2002#897).

Any questions or comments can be directed to me (Will) at
kb@wizardworkshop.com or via phone 412.519.8995.

My apologies for doing something the same night as money shot and
friction, but neither was listed when I first announced hallowbeatz.

Hope to see some list representation.

Umm, plurR or some shit.

Not a bad track.  I must mention though that "electroclash" is not a genre of music and you should be ashamed to attach that name to your music.  Please people stop useing that damn name.  Its simply electro and it has been around longer than any other style of electronic dance music.
On another note though I will be releaseing a star-studded electro 12" comp in Jan/Feb and am currently takeing submissions to add some new names mixed in with the already established ones.  I will be takeing submissions through 2002.  If interested in submitting tracks for consideration for this compilation feel free to email me privately at jbible@experimedia.net for further info.
I will spinning a set of DIrtyElectroDiscoRobotFunk at Bump3 in Cleveland on Nov 22nd.

Well where I come from "electroclash" is a bad word used only to lure suckers into thinking something that has been around for ages is something new and fashionable, not a real genre of music.  "Electroclash" was originally a festival that featured...guess what...electro acts.  Now its simply a term that has been adopted by trendy fashion magazines so the fashion industry can feed the fad in order to market expensive retro fashions.  This is exactly the reason I despise NY city.  They take something they didnt make, put a new catchy marketing term to it and call it thier own for one single purpose.....CASH.  To me the term "electroclash" translates to "electroCASH" which in my book is defined as "electro created for the sole purpose of makeing money".  And no I dont think I make the rules and I dont think either of us are qaulified to do so.  But I can say that those that are qaulified would agree with me.  So you can see why thats a bad word.  Honestly though Im not trying to be a dick im just trying to set the record straight.
No im not on that mailing list.  I have my resources.

Er, no. Electro and Electroclash are not the same. And sorry, you don't make the rules, I do.

its funny to me how you argue quite readily on what defines 
hardcore vs. jungle vs. HHC vs. whatever, yet now you 
suddenly "just like music". youre full of it, cracker. 

and everything thats lumped in the "electroclash" bin aside from 
adult. and dopplereffekt sucks, remember that when youre sporting
