             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

For eight years, Pittsburghers and many others from across multiple

and throw in a packed house that.s ready to get down. That.s the formula 
that.s been used since the beginning, and once you see it in action you 
will quickly realize why this is one of Pittsburgh.s most legendary 
parties year after year.

Welcome the advent of 2009 with open arms, open ears, and friendly

set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Candy Mountain: By Ways of the Shoe Shoe Train

January 31, 2009
 
2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip
Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."
 

JOHN CARPENTER
www.myspace.com/joncarpenter
www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

he has played in Pittsburgh, Philly. DC, Detroit, Bufflo, NewYork City & 
Italy.

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.
www.myspace.com/kiriyamamusic

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

$15 door

More details coming soon.
Stay tuned

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

[www.detroittechnomilitia.com]
-2008 Rustbelt Tour-

Detroit Techno Militia is a record label and a grass roots DJ/Producer 
collective dedicated to preserving the legacy of true Detroit electronic 
music and its proliferation around the world.

Similar to the restoration of historic architecture; we are not tearing 
down and building anew. Rather using the existing structure as a basis 
for our own endeavors. Detroit has always had much to offer musically 
and it is our mission to make it known to the rest of the world for 
generations to come.

As owner and co-founder of Bang Tech 12, DJ Seoul has been tearing up 
the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule that 
has taken him to literally thousands of events across North America. 
Including the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, which he considers a 
career highlight.

Here are some links to listen to some tunes as well:

Candy Mountain: By Ways of the Shoe Shoe Train

January 31, 2009
 
2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip
Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."
 

JOHN CARPENTER
www.myspace.com/joncarpenter
www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

he has played in Pittsburgh, Philly. DC, Detroit, Bufflo, NewYork City &

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.
www.myspace.com/kiriyamamusic

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

$15 door

More details coming soon.
Stay tuned

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Coming from the bowels of the furnace of the grand techno forge we are
proud to bring you the DETROIT TECHNO MILITIA!

Representing the DTM for their trip to Cleveland we are glad to bring 
you

<img src="http://www.bangtech12.com/main/images/stories/bio_djseoul_.jpg"><br>
DJ Seoul (DTM / Bangtech12)
Raised on the East side of Detroit, Bill had an early start in music.
At a young age, various forms of counterculture sounds and movements
heavily influenced him. His formal training began in 1985 with the
drums, and continues today with both traditional, and electronic
instruments.

On October 13th, 1995 it was at the Metroplex Records tenth year
anniversary party that DJ Seoul was born. It was at this time that
Bill figured out the difference between good music, bad music and
Detroit music. Seoul remembers listening to The Wizard's mix shows on
WJLB and the Electrifying Mojo on WGPR, and credits those as early
influences on his style. From the Wizard's lightning fast mixes to the
Mojo's diverse selections, DJ Seoul really began to appreciate the
responsibilty of the DJ to constantly be working and perfecting his
craft.  He also credits Detroit House legends, Terrence Parker, Kenny
Dixon Jr., Mike Clark and Theo Parrish as influencing his early career
as a House DJ. Later he developed his expertise as an Electro/Techno
Bass DJ. He cites influences: Aux 88, Drexciya, Model 500, Ectomorph
and Dopplereffekt, and electronic pioneers Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic
Orchestra, The Egyptian Lover, Afrika Bambaataa and Man Parrish.

It was a natural fit for him to play the music that he loved,
representing his home town properly by playing Detroit Music. Playing
wide assortments of music, from Electro, Hip-Hop and Rare Groove, to
House, and Detroit Techno, DJ Seoul has become known for his style of
bringing a Hip-Hop Turntablist style of mixing and scratching to his
set regardless of genre.

In 1996 he co-founded Bang Tech 12 with Greg Montgomery aka. DJ
Eclipse. Bang Tech once represented many acts that have gone on to
influence the world, including DJ Minx, Magda, Jerry The Cat, DJ
Moreese and 8en. Bang Tech 12 was responsible for many large scale,
quality underground events in Detroit in the mid to late nineties
including "Sounds of Futures Past", "Rampage", "Vertigo" and Return of
the Robot".

In addition to a 12 year DJ career that has taken him across the
world, Bill writes and produces electronic music with great attention
to detail. He collects vintage synthesizers and drum machines which he
uses to create music with a very distinct sound.  DJ Seoul has been
interviewed and featured on T.V. and Radio worldwide including FOX
News, WHFR, WCBN, WEMU, WDPM, CJAM, Techno.FM, NDR and Whitenoise
Radio on 3voor12.  You can find DJ Seoul's production work worldwide
on the Detroit Techno Militia and Drugaci Exhibitions Record Labels.

DJ Seoul looks upon the future with determination and hope, "The time
is over for looking down our noses in disdain at our fellow man
because their beliefs are different, or because they lack the teaching
to make educated decisions. By creating a knowledge base, sharing
knowledge, and teaching the history of Detroit music to the masses,
the uneducated understand and the weak become strong. Through
education and cultivation, we can destroy the mediocre standards that
have been placed as barriers in the music industry" . With DJ Seoul in
its ranks, the Detroit Techno Militia will continue to usher in an era
of change through the art of noise.

T. Linder
A veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under his belt;
Detroit native, T.Linder has done his homework and paid his dues.
T.Linder takes a no-nonsense, working-class approach to the art of
spinning records. He cites old-school Detroit street jocks: The Wizard
(aka. Jeff Mills), Gary Chandler, and Steve "DJ Energy" Crawford among
others, as major inspirations for his unorthodox aesthetic. "If
someone's going to pay money to hear me spin, I'm going to make it
worth their money. The way I look at it, there's too many DJs out
there meticulously and methodically blending records that all sound
the same. As a listener, I'm easily bored with that. I like to take
some risks when I perform, skipping across genres and eras, doing
scratch tricks with two copies of the same record. I want to give the
listener the experience of hearing something they haven't heard
before."

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule
that has taken him to literally thousands of events across North
America. He has played at most, if not all, of the venues in Detroit
catering to Electronic Music. Notably, 2030 Grand River, The Works,
Motor Lounge, St.Andrew's Hall, and the Underground Stage at the 2002
Detroit Electronic Music Festival (a gig that he considers one of his
career highlights).

In 2007, T.Linder released his first EP entitled DTM002 , on Detroit
Techno Militia (a record label/artist collective that he co-founded).
He has also done remix projects for legendary Detroit Techno producers
K.Hand, and Scan 7.

In the future he plans to continue doing what he has does best,
creating and playing timeless records, and asserting his position
within the rich history of Detroit Techno. "A lot of DJs are switching
over digital technology as a medium for their performances. I've been
very reluctant to take that step. I am a vinyl DJ first and foremost,
so I'll probably play records until my favorite labels stop pressing
them. Mainly because I find them more reliable. I've never had a
record crate crash in the middle of one of my shows and kill all of
the music. Additionally, I think there's something to be said for the
tradition of DJs playing old fashioned wax with analog turntables.
Music from the future, made and performed with equipment from the
past!"

2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip
Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."
 

JOHN CARPENTER

www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.
www.myspace.com/kiriyamamusic

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

$15 door

More details coming soon.
Stay tuned

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm

R.M.S.F.F presents:

Candy Mountain: By Ways of the Shoe Shoe Train

January 31, 2009
 
2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip
Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."
 

JOHN CARPENTER
www.myspace.com/joncarpenter
www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.
www.myspace.com/kiriyamamusic

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

$15 door

More details coming soon.
Stay tuned

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

R.M.S.F.F presents:

Candy Mountain: By Ways of the Shoe Shoe Train

January 31, 2009
 
2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip
Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."
 

JOHN CARPENTER
www.myspace.com/joncarpenter
www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

CONCEPT
--

hijack is an event series designed to introduce the modern styles of 
detroit and berlin's smaller venues to pittsburgh.

new amsterdam's environment will be transformed for each hijack.

local company inch pitch press creates unique pieces of art as 
promotional materials for each hijack. 1000 collectible pieces will be 
produced each month.

for the first event, 200 plastic access cards will be produced, and each 
attendee will receive one (which can then be used for reduced admission 
at future events).

hijack brings international talent regularly, including pittsburgh's 
first international resident, sage, from belfast, quarterly to the new 
amsterdam. well known for her intense drum and bass sets, her creation 
the all-female label phylum, and her landmark sponsorship for dc shoes, 
sage has recently taken to creating minimal, funky techno. she brings 
fresh productions and an international perspective as she stops here on 
her touring schedule.

each month will feature another well-respected musician alongside the 
residents edgar um, aaron clark and local.

rounding off the launch night is the announcement of hijack recordings, 
a new digital label that is seeking submissions for digital release. the 
first anticipated release, local's 'mystere,' will be in the summer of 
'09.

Sat Feb 21                  FOR THE LOVE OF IT 4                 Pittsburgh

Flux capacitor Presents

For the Love of It... 4

A birthday celebration, dedicated to the love of the music, the love of 
the scene, and the love of the vibe, once again done for the love of 
it....

Featuring:

Punisher (Live)
Hej Records, Prosthetic Pressings
Detroit - Techno

Hailing from Detroit, Michelle Herrmann better know as just Punisher, is 
a petite techno veteran that packs a powerful punch. An observer and 
artist by nature, Michelle was drawn to music and the creative side of 
life since the beginning. She was fortunate to find her way into the 
Detroit techno scene in the early 90.s when the energy was awe 
inspiring, and from that moment Punisher emerged. From her career's 
onset in 1993 at only 15 years old, Michelle has set a precedent of 
raising the bar high for all things Punisher through flawless 
productions and dance floor igniting DJ and live PA set.

To back the momentum of her constant stream of releases, Punisher 
travels the world, djing and performing live PA sets on an array of 
machines.  The recent Hej tour took her to Miami for WMC, South America 
where she represented Detroit at the Monte Mapu festival and famed 
afters of Ricardo Villalobos, Dominica 54, and a headlining spot at 
Detroit.s 2008 DEMF Movement festival. Within seconds she can hypnotize 
a crowd, her sound, a unique blend of exotic techno, sassy funk, and 
electric driving beats, has resonated on dance floors from the United 
States to Canada, Europe and Latin America. Michelle has literally 
pummeled walls of sound alongside artists such as Pascal F.E.O.S., Adam 
Beyer, Joel Mull, Marco Carola, Ben Sims, Alex Under,  and countless 
others, next time it could be you!

We are drawn to each other because of our diversity, unity, and love. <strong>UNITE</strong> and share the experience with us. Come out and make a new friend, forget your troubles, and be yourself. Remember . . . what you think . . . multiplies. 
  Think LOVE, MUSIC, and PEACE!

<strong>UNITE</strong> is the first of a series of monthly events that will showcase the finest talent in the area. The goal of <strong>Nocturnal Union</strong> is to grow the local electronic scene in a positive way, different than any event staged so far, by hosting creative, themed events.


<strong>What is a RAVE?</strong> A rave party is a term that describes an all night dance party with fast-paced electronic music and light shows. At these parties you can expect to see DJ.s, live performers, and other acts playing all forms of electronic music including hip hop, trance, house, techno, and drum and bass with the accompaniment of laser light shows, projected images, and lots of fog.

In the early 1990.s, ravers often followed simple principles such as peace, love, unity, and respect otherwise known as PLUR. There was once a time when you could attend a party and everyone was thought of as a friend. A rave party was a way to escape from the problems of everyday life and join other people with similar interests in music, dance, art, and camaraderie. PLUR may be interpreted as the way that a raver believes he or she should live his or her life, and how people are expected to behave at a rave.


<strong>  The definition describing PLUR is:</strong>

<strong>P</strong>eace - Hostility typically serves no purpose other than to defend an ego that is lacking inner peace. To make peace with all people around you.

<strong>L</strong>ove - Acts and feelings of goodwill towards all others are a moral imperative with their own rewards. To stay close to all people and care for them unconditionally.    

<strong>U</strong>nity - This can mean either that: We are all united in the human condition, or as social beings, the feeling of connectedness with others is the ultimate end to our efforts. To stand together for the universal cause of peace and love

<strong>R</strong>espect - A person must show regard for the feelings of others through their actions and inaction. And one must have respect for oneself. To understand the diversities of culture.

While raves are nothing new to us, our goal is to bring back what we lost, create something new, and keep it exciting.
  We invite you to <strong>UNITE</strong> with us; bring your dancing shoes, a toy or piece of candy to give to someone, a smiling face, a glow stick or two, and LIVE for one night you will never forget!

<strong>LOWdown . Pittsburgh / NYC
                
- Featuring Tirade and C-Doc The WarHammer of SLAMjams</strong>

SLAMjamz is owned and run by Chuck D of Public Enemy.
  
Entering the game in 1994 with a mutual love and respect for Hip Hop; Tirade and C-Doc became LOWdown, taking a cue from classic Tribe (The Low End Theory) and The Beatnuts (Street Level). Influenced by greats from Pete Rock and CL Smooth, Eric B &amp; Rakim, Cash Money and Marvelous, Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock, to Captain and Tenille, they immediately embarked on tracks for their debut: groundZERO, a bass-heavy, boom-bap romp with mind provoking lyrics and captivatingly tight beats that promise evolution in the Hip Hop sound.

Current projects have these two members of the World's First Virtual Rapp Squad (The Impossebulls) bringing the LOWdown funk as a side project to their otherHip Hop efforts into the new era of music.

<strong>CHRIS LASH . Omega Minus Records - Canton</strong>

<a href="http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vczIucGhvdG9idWNrZXQuY29tL2FsYnVtcy95MTUvdHNrMTIzLz9hY3Rpb249dmlldyZjdXJyZW50PUNIUklTTEFTSC5qcGc=" target="_blank"><img src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y15/tsk123/CHRISLASH.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket" /></a>

Chris Lash is an experimental electronic musician who has been actively writing and performing various forms of music since 1994. His work ranges from dance music to new age. Those who know his music often describe it as unclassifiable. Known for his voluptuous bass lines and ethereal rhythms one never knows what to expect and is never disappointed by one of his performances. The only thing certain is that no matter what musical mask he dawns, being the main brain behind such acts as Omega Minus, Plorb@tron and Ki Ko Te, you are sure to be moved.

<strong>Terry Mullan</strong>, Chicago's turntablist extraordinaire, turns out dance floors week after week throughout the US and abroad. His credits include Coachella, Sullivan Room, Bugged Out, The End, Footwork, and Ruby Skye amongst raves as far off as Japan, Australia and Germany. He has developed a faithful following to those who know through his signature style of funky quirky jacking acid house combined with cutting and scratching making up an entirely new genre all his own.

The eighties posed as the formative years of Terry's career. Although his roots began in hip-hop, he found himself smack in the middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. Soon after gaining inspiration from Chicago air personalities like Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, &amp; Mike &quot;Hitman&quot; Wilson via 102.7 WBMX, Terry made house his home. Next, when acid house hit the US, the link was completed; Terry found the sound he was looking for. It was that added flavor he was waiting for, something new, twisted and forward. Now all the elements were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this was it, three different languages, disco, house and techno. They could all translate the same message together or apart from one another.With his fluent style, these languages reflect his DJ'ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, Control, Funk'd, Chicago Housing Commission, Aciiieeed, and on his own imprint, Catalyst recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Halo Varga, Mazi, Angel Alanis &amp; TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, Acid OG's, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin project on Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva's former imprint Definitive which featured Terry's track &quot;Sidewinder&quot; on the Chemical Brothers &quot;Brother's Gonna' Work It Out&quot; mix cd. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely successful &quot;Products Of Our Environment&quot; EP on Catalyst which was featured on Pete Tong's essential selection on BBC radio 1 in the UK &amp; &quot;La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk&quot; EP on Smile which was licensed to several top DJ mix compilations. 

Terry's DJ'ing, label and tracks have earned him a reputation that extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

You could describe her style as sexy and soulful. <strong>Lady Bandit</strong> always tried to maintain that feeling. &quot;It's feel good music! Music that makes you feel sexy and just...feel good!&quot; She spends most of her time playing breakbeats but house is her first love. She has been known to play Nu Skool, whether it be dirty, funky, tech-funk or progressive breaks. It really doesn't matter. Just as long as the basslines are deep yet dirty, while the beats are funky.

She also plays electro, progressive, and tribal house. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladybandit" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/ladybandit</a>

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

nigel samways
veilleur de nuit
exp051

Experimedia brings you the new EP from English sound artist Nigel
Samways is part audio diary, part sonic love letter to the city of
Paris. Based around field recordings made on the rainy streets of a
night time metropolis - we find memories from magnetic tape & digital
disc resurfacing to drift amongst re workings of multiple versions of
Cole Porter's standard 'I Love Paris'. Here, distant jazz piano
dissolves into steaming kitchen doorways emerging from labyrinthine
side streets in an evocation of a personal recollection. This work
constitutes a companion piece of sorts to his previous "Mestre Full
Stop" EP which was based around field recordings made around Venice,
Italy.
