Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} legal question

Let's say I go into work to get my paycheck and my boss and I get into a
fist fight. The cops are called and an officer threatens to cite both my
boss and me. We decide not to pursue charing each other. after the cops
leave, my boss tells me he's not going to give me my final paycheck. Is
this legal? Does he have the right NOT to pay me for hours already worked?

That's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking someone is getting screwed here.

The boss is trying to blackmail the worker, saying that if he insists on
getting his paycheck, then the boss will proceed with charging him with
disorderly conduct for the fist fight, which he knows carries a $500 fine.

im not a lawyer so this does not constitue legal advice, but my take on the 
situtation is this:

technically - no he cannot withhold the pay, however, it is 100% within his 
right to threaten to press charges for the fist fight. employee is screwed, 
shouldn't have let his ego get in the way until he had the money in his account.

I think tying threating to press charges to the paycheck may be the
very definition of extortion.

But if the cops threatened to charge both individuals perhaps its just
an empty threat.  And then you could press charges for extortion.
What a cycle. Maybe one of you will wind up murdering the other down
the line :)

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

POPNONAME is 28-year-old artist and musician Jens-Uwe Beyer. Five years 
ago, he moved from the little German island of Fehmarn to Cologne, began 
composing scores for theatre and film and started his career by 
producing electronic club music. Over the last couple of years, 
POPNONAME has regularly contributed to KOMPAKT's Pop Ambient series, has 
released numerous maxi-singles on Cologne-based labels FIRM and ITALIC, 
and has just released his first full-length album. POPNONAME is now 
considered to be one of the most glamorous artists in Cologne's new 
music scene.

His releases receive a great deal of attention in both the international 
music press and in DJ reviews. His records are already played by most 
respected DJs such as JAMES HOLDEN or JOHN DIGWEED and have received a 
lot of positive feedback from the internet radio community LAST FM. The 
Swedish DIGFI magazine writes: "POPNONAME is actually the "Jack Kerouac" 
of Cologne Techno and he is a real sensation!"

Fri Sep 21                  NU-MARK AND ROC RAIDA                  Columbus

DJ Nu-Mark
Hip Hop // Soul (Breaks) // Brazilian (Samba) // Jurassic 5 // Blend 
Crafters . Los Angeles
www.myspace.com/djnumark

For well over ten years, DJ Nu-Mark has been among Hip-Hop.s most 
respected DJs and producers. Recognized for his membership in the gold 
selling group Jurassic 5, Nu-Mark is best known for his production on 
the raw anthem .What.s Golden. and the smooth and soulful .Work It Out,. 
featuring Dave Matthews. Additionally, his innovative DJ routines and 
creative on-stage antics have made him a favorite of crowds all over the 
world.

Perhaps best known for their thrilling stage show, Jurassic 5 has toured 
the globe several times over, and have made numerous television 
appearances. With Jurassic 5, Nu-Mark has performed at many of the 
world.s most important and exciting music festivals . Coachella, 
Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza 2003, Australia.s Big Day Out, The UK.s Reading 
Festival, and Japan.s Summer Sonic . where his mastery of a complex, 
six-piece DJ rig and his playful incorporation of children.s musical 
toys have amazed and delighted crowds of up to 50,000 fans. Jurassic 5 
has appeared alongside many of music.s greats, including A Tribe Called 
Quest, the Wu-Tang Clan, Outkast, The Roots, Run DMC, Green Day, and 
even Bruce Springsteen.

Nu-Mark is responsible for half of the production of Jurassic 5.s entire 
body of work: Jurassic 5 EP (1997), Quality Control (2000), Power In 
Numbers (2002), and Feedback (2006). He has also released his own 
projects, independent of the group: Blend Crafters, an instrumental 
album created in the spirit of allowing beats to speak for themselves, 
and Hands On, a mix-CD. Hands On assembles a diverse and eclectic set of 
sounds, everything from soulful breaks to comedic skits, as well as 
classic underground jams, and includes a special section devoted to 
hip-hop from around the world. By turns hilarious and impressive, this 
project displays both Nu-Mark.s eccentric sense of humor and his 
devotion to solid, simply dope music. Currently, Nu-Mark is placing his 
beats on a number of projects in a variety of genres.

Nu-Mark began DJing as a teenager in Los Angeles. Over the course of the 
last two decades, he has amassed a collection of over 35,000 records and 
refined his technical skills and performance style to the point where he 
is widely recognized as one of the key figures in the late-90s DJ 
explosion which pushed the DJ to the front of the culture.s awareness. 
As a result of this distinction, Nu-Mark has been featured in a 
diversity of publications and in several films: the critically acclaimed 
documentary .Scratch,. .KeepinTime. (which features impromptu 
collaborations with Mad Lib, Cut-Chemist, Babu, J-Rocc, and drummers 
James Gatson and Paul Humphrey), .Coachella: The Movie,. and .Rock the 
Bells . The Documentary..

Today, Nu-Mark is well-known for his innovative plays on sound . 
attaching a rubber band to his turntable.s needle and playing it like an 
upright bass or tapping on the turntable.s dust cover to simulate a bass 
drum. Incorporating a wide range of musical styles . soul, funk, 
hip-hop, and samba effortlessly blended together . Nu-Mark revels in 
surprising an audience with a forgotten gem, an unknown banger, or a 
fresh take on a well-known hit. From Sao Paolo to Sydney, from Toronto 
to Tokyo, Nu-Mark.s carefully crafted, explosively energetic DJ sets 
never fail to get a party rocking.

ROC RAIDA
HIP HOP // TURNTABLIST // X-ECUTIONERS  NY

Roc Raida began his DJ career in the early eighties at the age of ten. 
Surrounded by such inspirations as his father, a member of the Sugar 
Hill Records act Mean Machine and hip hop impresario Grandmaster Flash, 
Raida cultivated his interest into an absolute passion. Now, Roc Raida 
is considered among the best of the contemporary DJ.s and has brought 
the underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.
In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who, for obvious of copyright reasons, later 
became known as the X-ecutioners. Champions of furthering the 
turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made their reputation by 
utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the manual alteration between 
individual kick and snare sounds to create original drum patterns in 
real time. This practice has been an inspiration and a force in Roc 
Raida.s style.
In the beginning defeat was commonplace, as battles were mainly 
popularity contests. The more contests he entered the more the 
competition began to appreciate his style and determination. Pushing his 
limits and raising the standard with which DMC.s are judged, Raida began 
to get noticed. His impressive finishes in some of the premier DJ 
battles; first place in the 1991 "As One"; second place in the "Superman 
Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC US Finals were just the 
beginning. In 1995 Raida, was crowned the DMC World Champion in front of 
a massive London audience.
The past several years have seen Raida traveling around the globe 
promoting the art of Turntablism in such exotic locations as Singapore, 
Turkey, Japan and Australia. Last year on a panel at the Rock-n-Roll 
Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of 
Hip-Hop.s founding fathers. Rules for this dubious honor state that one 
may only be bestowed with the approval of another Grandmaster, Raida was 
not only approved, but welcomed by Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore and 
scratch evolutionist DST. To round out a phenomenal decade, Raida was 
inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the 1999 DMC World Finals in New 
York City.
Roc Raida was recently featured on an episode of "Saturday Night Live"; 
the first DJ to ever share the stage with the fabled SNL band. Proving, 
once again, that Raida is the perfect example of a master perfecting his 
art.
Turntablism has come up through the rave culture and is now showcased at 
every Electronic Music happening with crews such as The X-Ecutioners, 
Invisbl Skratch Piklz, Allies and Beat Junkies headlining events 
worldwide. Now with the success of the X-Ecutioners record .Built from 
Scratch. and .Revolutions. Raida has taken a step forward to work on his 
first solo effort .Raida.s Talent Search. which will be a CD and DVD 
combined showing Raida.s production and turntablists efforts as well as 
his comedy sketches throughout the DVD. Raida is also currently working 
on his autobiography of his life. Look out! As it is time for 
Grandmaster Roc Raida to take the world by storm once again.

Thu Sep 27                         KASKADE                         Columbus

www.kaskademusic.com
View e-flyer and sample CD at: www.ultrarecords.com/ECards/Kaskade
Bring the Night is the latest mix album by house DJ/producer Kaskade. 
Released on Ultra Records, Bring the Night is crafted to give unwavering 
house heads what they want most in a mix album: it delivers on the party 
front and drops the big room jams. And true to Kaskade styleand what 
differentiates this artist from others in dance musicBring the Night 
also manages to serve up those trademark melodies and sensual vocals.
But more than anything, this is 115 minutes of feel good body rock. 
"With my artist albums, I'm conveying emotion, I'm constructing beats 
and writing songs that represent me as an artist and a person, so it 
doesn't necessarily come out as 'dance heavy,'" says Kaskade. "But a mix 
CD is about walking the line, and fitting my style in with the DJ side 
of things. Yeah, I want to keep it musical and fresh, but Bring the 
Night is intentionally produced very rhythmic andwell, banging. This is 
a head bobbing mix, something to pop in your car and thump."
And with 15 hard-hitting tracks, including Dance Chart topping Kaskade 
remixes of Nelly Furtado's "All Good Things (Come To An End)", and 
Floetry's "SupaStar," Bring the Night achieves just thatit's a non-stop, 
seamless stream of orchestrated beats and flavor, all with a nod to the 
night life.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Noise is on Myspace; might want to hit him up there. Most of the fuckwads

You said "a girl," and I'm taking note. Don't know why I thought you were

A special live performance by Popnoname (Kompakt, Italic) =96 Germany

w/ live guitar and vocals! This is guaranteed to be an amazing show!

POPNONAME is 28-year-old artist and musician Jens-Uwe Beyer. Five years ago=
,
he moved from the little German island of Fehmarn to Cologne, began
composing scores for theatre and film and started his career by producing
electronic club music. Over the last couple of years, POPNONAME has
regularly contributed to KOMPAKT's Pop Ambient series, has released numerou=
s
maxi-singles on Cologne-based labels FIRM and ITALIC, and has just released
his first full-length album. POPNONAME is now considered to be one of the
most glamorous artists in Cologne's new music scene.

His releases receive a great deal of attention in both the international
music press and in DJ reviews. His records are already played by most
respected DJs such as JAMES HOLDEN or JOHN DIGWEED and have received a lot
of positive feedback from the internet radio community LAST FM. The Swedish
DIGFI magazine writes: "POPNONAME is actually the "Jack Kerouac" of Cologne
Techno and he is a real sensation!"

Well your data is probably safe, it could be a hardware issue, or
maybe you caught something nasty and your OS files are corrupted.
What I would recommend doing immediately is taking the hard drive out
and hooking it up to another PC (maybe buy a cheap USB enclosure for
it) and just backing up everything.

i fixed it, but lost some data. i reinstalled xp on that drive, and it
seems to work fine. is there a reason why xp wont let you install on a
different disc without formatting C? or does that mean that C was
corrupted? im still learning about this stuff  =)

You can install a new copy of xp over the top of the old copy without
reformatting the drive. It will try and be all "no u shouldn't do that
blah blah" but you can and it will install fresh files over top of the
old ones. you will usually have allot of blot left over from files NOT
getting deleted that wouldn't be part of the clean install but hey.
You'll even see your old programs in the program files folder on C but
they wont work because they need to be "re-installed". BUT you will
save your files, they will be under c/documents and settings/[old

yep... boot with your xp disk.

select Recovery Console mode.

when you get to the c: prompt, run:

chkdsk /r

this will fix any bad parts of the disk

then try to reinstall if you cant get it to boot.

note:  if you try reinstalling over top of an OEM install (from the
manufacturer), there is a txt or log file in c:\windows\system32 that you
should delete if there ... i forget the exact name, but it's something like
OEM_uninst.txt or .log... or something that has uninst in the filename  (dir
*.log or dir *.txt while in the directory will find these for you)

if those arent deleted on OEM installs, it's been known to overwrite the
user directories in documents and settings, thus still losing your data if
you dont delete that file first.

if all else fails, go to radio shack and get a bulk demagnetizer and run it
in circles above your hard drive.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} some help pls

XP uses MBR - Master Boot Record, and probably wanted to do something
to the MBR on the primary disk; if it was corrupt that could have what
you encountered if it really wanted to format it.

If there is a next time, first thing to try before a complete
reinstall if you need to get data from that primary disk is to go into
the XP setup, do the F8 and then when it asks to install or attempt
repair on existing, hit R.  it should look and see the other instance
of windows and have you old install as a choice.  That type of repair
leaves all your data intact.  If it doesnlt give you the option of
doing a repair because it doesn't see the old instance of windows it
is probably not worth attempting to reinstall on that partition
either.  it still could have easily recoverable data though if the
file table is still intact.  In that case I would exit the install and
try one these options:

Easiest, perhaps would have been to remove the f'ed up primary drive
and reconfigure new harddrive to be the first harddrive by physically
connecting it first in the chains of channels and Master Slave
settings.  After the new install is done you could then connnect the
other harddrive as a secondary and then see if you can get your data,

or if you didn't have another harddrive you could always boot from a
linux live CD, mount your old partition that had your data on it and
burn the data to media or something, then reformat and reinstall
windows if your disk was good.  Good idea to have a linux boot CD on
hand before it would be needed though for that to work.  Although just
throwing your old drive in another already working system to get the
data off is still probably easier.

I would do some drive checking on that disk before you depend on it
again.  It could have been just a windows issue though and in that
case the disk would be fine after a reformat.  Better safe than sorry
though.

Nice shots, Brian.

Props to Paul "Badger" Fleetwood and the humanaut crew. Looks like a

[image: Closer - Closer - Natalie Portman - Flixster Photo]

this photograph of natalie portman from the film 'closer',
describes spiritual love.

zionist jews believe that zion is a new jerusalem, a new
heaven and a new earth prophesized in revelation.  this
is why i had declared vegas a new zion at one point,
since the fountain of living water seemed to fulfill
biblical prophecy.

jesus christ described the kingdom of god as not on earth,
but a spiritual kingdom.

and since God is love, God's spiritual kingdom is a kingdom
of peace and love.

this is why the underground magazine i did before was PLRM,
peace, love, rave, magazine.

love is free and unconditional.

love parade SF, now known as love fest SF, is free and
unconditional.

although i initiated Love Parade SF as an anniversary party
for the founding of the UN, i never intended it to be a one
world government like the UN, instead i wanted it to be
a continuation of the underground rapture i started in ohio
in 1984.

for more information concerning love parade SF, now known
as love fest SF, check my site: myspace.com/rapture3169

peace and love,
steve t 3169
international intelligence director

----

ok, since there had been an over bearing nazi agenda by the media with
the influx of nazi propaganda, treating non-whites like monkeys and dogs
that need to be told what to do as well as the abundantly obvious nazi
agenda of the mormons, burning mexican houses down and treating
non-whites like slaves and servants, it has become abundantly obvious
that certain german americans have lost the true meaning of love parade
to pursue a nazi agenda once again trying to trick america into WWIII
with obvious hate campaigns against arabs, pakistan, mexicans, japanese,
vietnamese, koreans, brits, france, italy, greece, jews, native american
indians,
etc. therefore i must take away love parade SF from the germans this year
and delegate things to the jews and brits this year.  the germans will still

have Oktoberfest in october, however.  and i had already invited pope joseph
ratzinger for it and arranged for the hells angels to do security for the
event again.

most sincerely,
steve t 3169
international intelligence director

*in no way shape or form are the gemans completely out of love parade SF
plans, here are the new break down of delegation of love parade SF...

jews - investors and some internet media promotions
brits - imported euro DJ's and some tv media promotions
asians - security with heather fung, SFPD chief, and food in chinatown, SF.

            national guard and q*bert and SF b-boys doing plain clothes

<div>ok, since there had been an over bearing nazi agenda by the media with</div>
  
<div>the influx of nazi propaganda, treating non-whites like monkeys and dogs </div>
  
<div>that need to be told what to do as well as the abundantly obvious nazi </div>
  
<div>agenda of the mormons, burning mexican houses down and treating </div>
  
<div>non-whites like slaves and servants, it has&nbsp;become abundantly obvious </div>
  
<div>that certain german americans have lost the true meaning of love parade </div>
  
<div>to pursue a nazi agenda once again trying to trick america into WWIII </div>
  
<div>with obvious hate campaigns against arabs, pakistan, mexicans, japanese, </div>
  
<div>vietnamese, koreans, brits, france, italy, greece, jews, native american indians, </div>
  
<div>etc. therefore i must take away love parade SF from the
 germans&nbsp;this year</div>
  
<div>and delegate things to the jews and brits this year.&nbsp; the germans will still </div>
  
<div>have Oktoberfest in october, however.&nbsp; and i had already invited pope joseph</div>
  
<div>ratzinger for it and arranged for the hells angels to do security for the</div>
  
<div>event again.</div>

spiritual love...
[image: Closer - Closer - Natalie Portman - Flixster Photo]

this photograph of natalie portman from the film 'closer',
describes spiritual love.

zionist jews believe that zion is a new jerusalem, a new
heaven and a new earth prophesized in revelation.  this
is why i had declared vegas a new zion at one point,
since the fountain of living water seemed to fulfill
biblical prophecy.

jesus christ described the kingdom of god as not on earth,
but a spiritual kingdom.

and since God is love, God's spiritual kingdom is a kingdom
of peace and love.

this is why the underground magazine i did before was PLRM,
peace, love, rave, magazine.

love is free and unconditional.

love parade SF, now known as love fest SF, is free and
unconditional.

although i initiated Love Parade SF as an anniversary party
for the founding of the UN, i never intended it to be a one
world government like the UN, instead i wanted it to be
a continuation of the underground rapture i started in ohio
in 1984.

as love fest SF, check my blog on my site: myspace.com/rapture3169

SF LOVEFEST 2006 WRAP-UP

San Francisco felt the LOVE and so did the *65,000* people that showed up at
SF LoveFest 2006.* 23* floats, *25* sound systems, *200+* DJs gigging,
*1 *spectacular
City Hall, *1* marriage ceremony, countless unofficial after parties
and *1*gigantic official after event with over
*9,000* in attendance, and *0* problems.


"We are extremely excited about the success of SF Lovefest 2006. After a
challenging year of planning, in a short time frame, to see this event come
off as well as it did was an amazing feat and a fantastic outcome.",
said*Joshua Smith, SF LoveFest Board President.
*"It is a testament to the community who have supported us from the
beginning and who said repeatedly, that we could call it what we wanted as
long as there was a parade and festival to be had. It was an incredible
feeling to look out over the sea of people in attendance. Our mission seemed
fulfilled at that one extraordinary moment; to create a place and event
where people from diverse backgrounds and walks of life, could come together
under one unifying umbrella - SF LoveFest 2006.This event wouldn't have been
what it was without the volunteers, the City of San Francisco, the artists
and float/event producers, or the people who participated, and we are
thankful to them all."

*"It really knocked me out. It was my first time in San Francisco and the
city truly swept me away. Colorful, beautiful people just rocked and rocked
and rocked." **Benny Benassi*

*"The Lovefest represents what the electronic music scene is about - a
community of people inspired by music, which enables us to create and
achieve the unbelievable. It is a moment in life that will always be
remembered. I would like to give my respect to everyone who participated in
the production of this event, to the artists that performed, to the those
that attended and especially to the City of San Francisco for allowing us to
create this celebration. Your cooperation and respect are
appreciated."** **Christopher
Lawrence*

*"Great crowd. Very strong event with great production. It was wonderful to
be a part of it." **Paul Oakenfold*

*"San Francisco LoveFest is the most chaotic, euphoric, unmissable party
event on our calendar! Where else can you see Above & Beyond, Paul Oakenfold
and naked men on roller skates all in one day??" **Above & Beyond*

*"Lovefest was better than ever this year. The buzz at the event was
electric and I cannot imagine a much better city in America to throw such an
event. I met people from all over the country that had flown in for the
event and they were all blown away to say the least. It's one of the best
festivals America has going at the moment and it seems to keep getting
better!" **DJ Dan**
*

Before the Parade set off down Market St., it received the blessing of none
other then Love Parade Founder, Dr. Motte. He gave a proper keynote speech
that empowered each individual within the parade to recognize all of the
event's participants as a complete community. From the DJs to the visual
artists, the city workers at the event to ensure safety, and the hundreds of
volunteers and organizers who had worked so diligently to make this event a
reality, it brought them all together under SF LoveFest.

At the Civic Center Plaza, Grandmaster Flash gave the audience a performance
showcasing his love for the DJ culture; Above & Beyond dished out their
special form of trance; Bad Boy Bill whipped the crowd with his Chicago
signature sound; DJ Rap housed it, DJ Dan worked it; the Opel/Qool crew
brought world class breakbeat; the SF locals showcased their specialty - a
little bit of all of it is the classiest form; and there were so many more
performances that deserve standing ovations. It was apparent to all that
this event was not just for the fans, as the artists were having more than a
bit of fun themselves!

San Francisco has something special on its hands, perhaps this is due to the
history of the city and the community able to embrace and accept diversity.
>From the mayor to the police officers, the citizens, the rich traditions of
music and festivals and the amazing art community, this city is the perfect
home to this event. But this event wasn't just about the party. It was also
about a message of love and respect and cooperation through the vehicle of
dance music. Which will sustain the participants long past the last record
that was played...

   Quote of Support from Loveparade Berlin Founder Dr Motte

"If you had experienced the Loveparade in San Francisco the last 2 years and
have tasted the Rapture at its heart, then you will know something of what
is coming. The new San Francisco LoveFest experience is at the very heart of
the dance culture phenomenon that is spreading rapidly and unstoppable
around the world. It is about LOVE and it is about FREEDOM. It is about
remembering Who We Really Are and why we are here. The San Francisco
LoveFest itself is part of a much wider personal, social and spiritual
transformation-revolution which will utterly change our world over the
coming decades. Our very ideas about who we are and what we are capable of
are about to be turned upside down. With this next evolution of the event,
we are about to take a step into a different future in which all that is
best and most beautiful in the human soul will find the right conditions to
flower.

THIS IS OUR FUTURE. OPEN YOUR HEART ... FREE YOUR MIND ... FACE YOUR
FEARS... LIVE YOUR SOUL ... DANCE!"
- Dr. Motte, Founder: Loveparade Berlin

The San Francisco LoveFest is an volunteer non-profit organization. Any
profits made from the event go back into next year's event and to
participating non-profit organizations. This year's event is a new event
that takes into account our alignment with the original vision of the
Loveparade events, our experience throwing them the last 2 years, and makes
it our own. That vision of a free parade that celebrates music, love,
diversity, tolerance, dance, and community is something we believe in
strongly, and believe America needs now more than ever. Dance music has
always had a special ability to bring people together in the shared beauty
of a universal vibe. Our community by and large remains 'underground' in U.S.
pop culture due to very little support from radio and MTV, etc. We know that
in a culture awash in conflict, materialism, superficial concerns, and
greed, an event of this kind can lift the spirits and the hopes of those who
to surrender to it's power. The power of dance. The power of music. The
power of community. We're taking it to the streets letting the vibe and the
cooperation and respect of the people taking part in it be a message of hope
in dark times. We intend to make the event a platform for dance music to
reach more ears in America and beyond, to carry a message of love and hope,
to be a vehicle for helping organizations doing good in the world, and for
dancing our asses off surrounded by friendly freaks. See you in the streets.

<p><font size="2">Before the Parade set off down Market St., it
received the blessing of none other then Love Parade Founder, Dr.
Motte. He gave a proper keynote speech that empowered each individual
within the parade to recognize all of the event&#39;s participants as a
complete community. From the DJs to the visual artists, the city
workers at the event to ensure safety, and the hundreds of volunteers
and organizers who had worked so diligently to make this event a
reality, it brought them all together under SF LoveFest. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">At the Civic Center Plaza, Grandmaster Flash gave the
audience a performance showcasing his love for the DJ culture; Above
&amp; Beyond dished out their special form of trance; Bad Boy Bill
whipped the crowd with his Chicago signature sound; DJ Rap housed it,
DJ Dan worked it; the Opel/Qool crew brought world class breakbeat; the
SF locals showcased their specialty - a little bit of all of it is the
classiest form; and there were so many more performances that deserve
standing ovations. It was apparent to all that this event was not just
for the fans, as the artists were having more than a bit of fun
themselves! </font></p>
<p><font size="2">San Francisco has something special on its hands,
perhaps this is due to the history of the city and the community able
to embrace and accept diversity. From the mayor to the police officers,
the citizens, the rich traditions of music and festivals and the
amazing art community, this city is the perfect home to this event. But
this event wasn&#39;t just about the party. It was also about a message of
love and respect and cooperation through the vehicle of dance music.
Which will sustain the participants long past the last record that was
played... </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;If you had experienced the Loveparade in San
Francisco the last 2 years and have tasted the Rapture at its heart,
then you will know something of what is coming. The new San Francisco
LoveFest experience is at the very heart of the dance culture
phenomenon that is spreading rapidly and unstoppable around the world.
It is about LOVE and it is about FREEDOM. It is about remembering Who
We Really Are and why we are here. The San Francisco LoveFest itself is
part of a much wider personal, social and spiritual
transformation-revolution which will utterly change our world over the
coming decades. Our very ideas about who we are and what we are capable
of are about to be turned upside down. With this next evolution of the
event, we are about to take a step into a different future in which all
that is best and most beautiful in the human soul will find the right
conditions to flower.<br><br>THIS IS OUR FUTURE. OPEN YOUR HEART ... FREE YOUR MIND ... FACE YOUR FEARS... LIVE YOUR SOUL ... DANCE!&quot;<br>- Dr. Motte, Founder: Loveparade Berlin</font></p><font size="2"><a name="values">
</a></font>
<h2 class="sIFR-replaced"><font size="2">

  
  
  
</font></h2>
<p><font size="2">The San Francisco LoveFest is an volunteer non-profit
organization. Any profits made from the event go back into next year&#39;s
event and to participating non-profit organizations. This year&#39;s event
is a new event that takes into account our alignment with the original
vision of the Loveparade events, our experience throwing them the last
2 years, and makes it our own. That vision of a free parade that
celebrates music, love, diversity, tolerance, dance, and community is
something we believe in strongly, and believe America needs now more
than ever. Dance music has always had a special ability to bring people
together in the shared beauty of a universal vibe. Our community by and
large remains &#39;underground&#39; in U.S. pop culture due to very little
support from radio and MTV, etc. We know that in a culture awash in
conflict, materialism, superficial concerns, and greed, an event of
this kind can lift the spirits and the hopes of those who to surrender
to it&#39;s power. The power of dance. The power of music. The power of
community. We&#39;re taking it to the streets letting the vibe and the
cooperation and respect of the people taking part in it be a message of
hope in dark times. We intend to make the event a platform for dance
music to reach more ears in America and beyond, to carry a message of
love and hope, to be a vehicle for helping organizations doing good in
the world, and for dancing our asses off surrounded by friendly freaks.
See you in the streets.</font></p><font size="2"><a name="get_involved"></a></font>

Subject: {pb-cle} rose line of the mary magdalene...

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

previously I had a blue rose picture on my myspace.com/stevet3169
site...most people recognize it as the blue rose that the manchester,
england band 'new order' used for one of their albums (inside the 1987
'substance' album to be exact). at first one thinks of "true blue" or
"true faith" (one of new order's songs), when seeing the blue rose, but
there is a deeper significance to it: the rose line of the mary magdalene.
before getting into it, i want to draw several parallels with my life and
the history of the legendary rose line of the mary magdalene.

first, the high school i went to when i grew up was rootstown high school,
home of the rovers.  root as in the biblical root of david and the rovers,
the viking ships of the nords. check my school logo on this site:
http://sparcc.rootstown.com/engine?p=679&c=16 ...the significance
of course is the viking logo of the rovers...the root of david, is the
semitic
line, which started with shem, first blessed son of noah.  shem traveled
to the mount of the east aka modern day china and started my line,
the chinese royal line over 4,500 years ago, the oldest of all the royal
lines when the chinese emperors were known as 'hwong dee' aka
'golden earth', chosen messengers of God.

i briefly attended western reserve academy in hudson, ohio, home of the
pioneers, before returning to rootstown.  i liked rootstown better because
that was where my friends from growing up were at. my straight A average
in rootstown middle school as well as records in the presidential fitness
test got me into Western Reserve Academy.  but WRA was too snooty
for me. i had always been a bit of a rebel, listening to alternative music
like new order, tears for fears, and depeche mode since 1980.

i graduated from rootstown high with a 3.85 GPA in 1988.  i ran varsity
cross country (our team made it to state when bob kennedy went to
nationals), was in varsity wrestling, and varsity track.  my events were
the long jump and hurdles. i briefly had a school record at low hurdles,
and then it was broken the next year by tom yates, this very athletic
black kid.  my best friend in high school was gary huhn, this german
american whose father had the long jump record and was captain of
the football team.  i found it funny that i did better at german class than
he did and actually had to give a speech for him for class rep, when he
decided to bail.  I was a bit of an over achiever in high school, i was
editor in chief of the high school paper, president of the ski club, part of

the drama club, was honor roll, and even started a survival club to play
capture the flag while at rootstown.

as for my early love life, i remember writing some cute letters to myra
davis, but consider my first date as aisha pierce (part british part french)

in high school...i met her with some kent roosevelt friends at this winter
event at sea world.  and then took her to see stephen spielberg's "empire
of the sun" followed by an italian dinner.  back then i refered to aisha as
"the light in the shade of the morning sun" from the new order song
"true faith" since i was quite obsessed with her at the time...but one night

i fell asleep on her after pulling an all nighter to cram for this test the
night
before and she decided she wanted to see other people.  se la vie!

my first job was a cashier at giant eagle's drug store, but i ended up
working
at sea world, first in a gift shop, then as a potraiture artist.  i had even
gotten
aisha her family crest as a gift from sea world's gift shop.  apparently, at
the
time, she didn't even know she was from a royal british line.  i became a
caricature artist at geauga lake park...i had always been a pretty good
artist, started drawing in 3D when i was 5 and was the 2nd best artist at
WRA: 1st was jim lee, this korean kid (he's alot like jim lee the real
comic book artist, 2nd was me with a art adams / bill sienckiewicz style,
3rd was my roommate: kevin prufer, with a da vinci style, he was also
strangely enough, the great grandson of hitler's second in command (he
wasn't a nazi, he eventually became an english professor)...i was scouted
to be an artist for DC comics when george perez was drawing superman,
but i had to tell him i had made plans to go to college (case western
reserve
university specifically).

during the summer of '88 i was a part of IASP, which allowed me to travel
to mexico with a bunch of other gifted high school students where i got to
see the temples there, the aztec calendar, the image of the lady guadelupe,
and para-sail in acapulco.  and since i excelled at computers, i was invited

to take a summer class at rose hulman institute of technology in indiana.
secretly, it was also because i was the first kid to solve the rubic's cube
in
my town and because of my high scores at missile command, i was being
scouted by the defense department to go to NORAD at a very young age.
the summer of '88 was very good for me. i closed it out by getting some
of my friends to go to the new order concert and the depeche mode music
for the masses concert at blossom music center in cleveland, ohio.

at case western reserve university (home of the spartans), i was briefly
at sigma chi christian fraternity (whose crest looks alot like the TBN
crest)
and then decided to join zeta beta tau zionist fraternity (the skull and
bones
of jewish fraternities whose alumni list reads like a who's who list of
famous
government workers, media owners, sports broadcasters, and entertainers,
check: http://bama.ua.edu/~zbt/famous_alumni_of_zbt.htm<http://bama.ua.edu/%7Ezbt/famous_alumni_of_zbt.htm>
the cleveland chapter was the lambda chapter of CWRU, one of the oldest.
i was in varsity track at CWRU, but i never lost my passion for underground
music, I used to go to all the alternative concerts and clubs and eventually
became a WRUW 91.1 FM college radio DJ.  I also started the CWRU
billiard club, the CWRU rave team, and PLRM magazine while in college.
I used to do bus trips to all these big raves in cleveland, pittsburgh,
toronto, baltimore, new york, philadelphia, indiana, chicago, columbus,
kentucky, st. louis, etc. I was quite a super promotor back then promoting
for smart bar, columbus, major raves all over the midwest, and ended up
putting together the big meeting of all the ohio promotors from which
'family affair' came from.

i was infamous for partying, going to concerts, or clubbing every
weekend with my frat brothers: my little brother: jim raishart (another
german american, whose real last name was reichart, but changed it,
because he thought it sounded too nazi...ironically, he's from cinci,
ohio and told me stories about the grand pooh bah of the KKK, who
used to live in cinci, ohio) and lars fisher (straight out of germany,
except he wasn't little, he was 6' 8")...i used to go to clubs with pam
the cool lens crafter chick, lady miss lisa, becky from chicago
northwestern, and the girl i dated in college: olga #1, this polish
american girl, who was a lesbian when i first met her, but became
bi after me.  she introduced me to universal unitarianism, what paul
revere was when he ran through town yelling: "the british are coming,
the british are coming" right before the revolutionary war (thus my
minuteman connection).

I briefly dropped out of CWRU for awhile to make some money from '94
to '97 at MBNA (a Fortune 500 company job one couldn't get unless you
passed a drug test and 2 interviews) within one month i became the best
rep there and was promoted to Mentor 218.  I was selected to represent
cleveland for the all-star competition in dallas, which i tied for 4th with
a
4.0 SPH.  as a result i got to go to corporate in delaware and to attend
a NASCAR race in connecticut.   ironically, i worked at MBNA when
louie freeh was the FBI director and was an exec at MBNA, he had even
used MBNA for some financial investigations.

I graduated from CWRU the summer of '97 with a double degree in
architecture, art history, and a minor in theatre. but my final project
before i graduated was a 24 page term paper on simon vouet's
mary magdalene painting at the cleveland museum of art.

I decided to move down to columbus, ohio to be closer to my girlfriend
of 2 years at the time: christa rector.  we broke up around the same
time princess di passed away.  she wanted to move to detroit and see
other people. i didn't.  and then i met layla, another crazy german girl.
and layla really was crazy, she did all kinds of crazy drugs, many of
which i had never even heard of before.  she got them, because she
was bi-polar.  this didn't always mix well with me especially since at
the time i was a part of the pre Y2K intelligence team for the state of
ohio with accounts with wright patterson air force, city of columbus,
ohio state boards, and various fortune 500 companies (jobs you can't
get unless you passed a drug test, 2 interviews, and had government
connections)...she was alot of fun though.  and within 3 months i had
given her a ring.  i don't think she took it very seriously, because within
3 more months she was seeing other guys. i eventually took the ring
back when i caught her messing around on me for the third time.
suffice it to say, she wasn't a very faithfull girl at the time.  in fact,
i think she participated in alot of illegal activities with gerrad martin,
al quida jinx, and taliban favor...nevertheless, she had an uncanny
resemblence to the mary magdalene for me...the crazy thing is that
although she was german american, she didn't understand german,
but she understood french...france, the location of the remains of
st. mary of magdala, and the birthplace of the legendary rose line
of the mary magdalene, check this site for the rose line legend:

<div><font face="arial narrow">previously I had a blue rose picture on my <a href="http://myspace.com/stevet3169">myspace.com/stevet3169</a></font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">site...most people recognize it as the blue rose that the manchester,
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">england band &#39;new order&#39; used for one of their albums (inside the 1987</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">&#39;substance&#39; album to be exact). at first one thinks of &quot;true blue&quot; or
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">&quot;true faith&quot; (one of new order&#39;s songs), when seeing the blue rose, but </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">there is a deeper significance to it: the rose line of the mary magdalene.
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">before getting into it, i want to draw several parallels with my life and</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the history of the legendary rose line of the mary
 magdalene.</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">first, the high school i went to when i grew&nbsp;up was rootstown high&nbsp;school, </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">home of the rovers.&nbsp; root as in the biblical&nbsp;root of david and the rovers, 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the viking ships of the nords. check&nbsp;my&nbsp;school logo on this site:&nbsp;</font></div>  <div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sparcc.rootstown.com/engine?p=679&amp;c=16">
<font face="arial narrow">http://sparcc.rootstown.com/engine?p=679&amp;c=16</font></a><font face="arial narrow">&nbsp;...the significance</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">of course is the viking logo of the rovers...the root of david, is the semitic
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">line, which started with shem, first blessed son of noah.&nbsp; shem traveled</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">to the mount of the east
 aka modern day china and started my line,</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the chinese royal line over 4,500 years ago, the oldest of all the royal</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">lines when the chinese emperors were known as &#39;hwong dee&#39; aka
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">&#39;golden earth&#39;, chosen messengers of God.</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">i briefly attended western reserve academy in hudson, ohio, home of the
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">pioneers, before returning to rootstown.&nbsp; i liked rootstown better because</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">that was where my friends from growing up were at.&nbsp;my straight A average 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">in rootstown middle school as well as records in the presidential fitness </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">test got me into Western Reserve Academy.&nbsp;
 but WRA was too snooty</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">for me.&nbsp;i had always been a bit of a rebel, listening to alternative music</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">like new order, tears for fears, and depeche mode since 1980.&nbsp; 
</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">i graduated from rootstown high with a 3.85 GPA in 1988.&nbsp; i ran varsity </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">cross country (our team made it to state when bob kennedy went to
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">nationals), was in varsity wrestling, and varsity track.&nbsp; my events were </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the long jump and hurdles.&nbsp;i briefly had a school record at low hurdles, 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">and then it was broken the next year by tom yates, this very athletic </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">black kid.&nbsp; my best
 friend in high school was gary huhn, this german </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">american whose father had the&nbsp;long jump record and was captain of </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the football team.&nbsp; i found it funny that i did better at german class than 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">he did and actually had to give a speech for him for class rep, when he</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">decided to bail.&nbsp; I was a bit of an over achiever in high school, i was 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">editor in chief of the high school paper, president of the ski club, part of </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the drama club, was honor roll, and even started a survival club to play 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">capture the flag while at rootstown.&nbsp;</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">as for my early love life,
 i&nbsp;remember writing some&nbsp;cute letters to myra </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">davis, but consider my&nbsp;first date as aisha pierce (part british part french) </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">in high school...i met her with some kent roosevelt friends at this winter 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">event at sea world.&nbsp; and then took her to see stephen spielberg&#39;s &quot;empire </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">of the sun&quot; followed by an italian dinner.&nbsp; back then i refered to aisha as 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">&quot;the light in the shade of the morning sun&quot; from the new order song </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">&quot;true faith&quot; since i was quite obsessed with her at the time...but one night 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">i fell asleep on her after&nbsp;pulling an all nighter to cram for this test the night</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">before and she
 decided she wanted to see other people.&nbsp; se la vie!</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">my first job was&nbsp;a cashier at giant eagle&#39;s drug store, but i ended up working</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">
at sea world, first in a gift shop, then as a&nbsp;potraiture artist.&nbsp; i had even gotten </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">aisha her family crest as a gift from sea world&#39;s gift shop.&nbsp; apparently, at the</font>
</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">time, she didn&#39;t even know she was from a royal british line.&nbsp; i became a</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">caricature artist&nbsp;at geauga lake park...i had always been a pretty good 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">artist, started drawing in 3D when i was 5 and was the 2nd best artist at</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">WRA: 1st was jim lee, this&nbsp;korean kid (he&#39;s alot like jim lee
 the real</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">comic book artist,&nbsp;2nd was me&nbsp;with a art adams / bill sienckiewicz style,</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">3rd was my roommate: kevin prufer, with a da vinci style, he was also
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">strangely enough, the great grandson of hitler&#39;s second in command (he </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">wasn&#39;t a nazi, he eventually became an english professor)...i was scouted
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">to&nbsp;be an artist&nbsp;for DC comics when george perez was drawing superman, </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">but i had to tell him i&nbsp;had made plans to go to college (case western reserve 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">university specifically).&nbsp;</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">during the summer of &#39;88 i was a part of IASP, which allowed me to
 travel </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">to mexico with a bunch of other gifted high school students where i got to </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">see&nbsp;the temples there, the aztec calendar, the image of the lady guadelupe, 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">and para-sail in acapulco.&nbsp; and since i excelled at computers, i was invited </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">to take a summer class at rose hulman institute of technology in indiana.
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">secretly, it was also because i was the first kid to solve the rubic&#39;s cube in </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">my&nbsp;town and because of my high scores at missile command, i was being
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">scouted by the defense department to go to NORAD at a very young age.</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the summer of &#39;88 was very good for me. i closed it out by getting
 some</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">of my friends to go to the new order concert and the depeche mode music</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">for the masses concert at blossom music center in cleveland, ohio.
</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">at case western reserve university (home of the spartans), i was briefly</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">at sigma chi christian fraternity (whose crest looks alot like the TBN crest)

ok, i have a solution, just like my solution of promoting for
joe jackson's studio 54 in berlin, germany to diminish the
amount of violent rioters during G8 by inviting them to
studio 54 in germany, i am proposing a separate after
party.  there is the traditional after party at the billy graham
civic auditorioum.  but for the more hardcore party go'ers
i am proposing a separate after party on alcatraz with
a very similar theme to the scheduled exotic erotic ball
at the cow palace, see: http://www.exoticeroticball.com
but with DNB DJ's.

the shooting and missed the allegdly "gay" group, so it was
not reported to authorities.  but apparently, witnesses did see
it happen, so it will be considered as a security threat for
this year.  the story seems plausible since an NBC black
reporter was just shot in oakland, ohio for reporting too much
black crime in oakland, ohio...in addition, there is a security
video of violent activity occuring in san diego on labor day...
there were some violent attacks on "gays" in the past where
the victims were killed, so it can happen again...i am
recommending video security for love fest 2007...in the past
i have worked with NBC, who also broadcasts the Olympics,
but recently NBC has had some peculiar problems that i had
to call out (targeting computer industry workers and VIP's for
some unauthorized internet predator stings, which eventually
led to the arrest of a republican senator in idaho...unfortunately,
microsoft is a large part of NBC with MSNBC and microsoft
is sponsoring the emmy's this year and of course republicans
were not too happy either...in addition, i had to state when
officers are used for unauthorized stings, it can count as
dereliction of duty, if the officer neglected his designated
patrol area to go on an unauthorized investigation...even
when officers take a break at a restautant, it is supposed
to be reported to dispatch, so other officers can be used to
cover the area where the officers are taking a break at).

there are ZBT alumni who work at CBS, ABC, and FOX.
so all three are being considered.

some jews, who are still a little sour at nazi's who killed
6 million jews during WWII, want to deport nazi's entirely...

A possible amendment of that law and others to prevent the emergence of
similar groups is also being considered.

Eight of the suspected members of a Petah Tikva-based neo-Nazi group were
brought to the Ramle Magistrate's Court for remand extensions Sunday.
Knesset members expressed anger and began to discuss ways of closing
legislative loopholes that do not prevent the existence of such groups. The
suspects, including alleged ringleader Eli "Eli the Nazi" Boanitov, were
brought to court, protesting their innocence. The remands of the suspects
were extended until Tuesday. Outside the courtroom, Boanitov's mother said
her son had done no wrong and was a victim of persecution of Russian
immigrants. Sheetrit said he would consider revoking the citizenship of
members of the ring, all of whom immigrated to
Israel<http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=3D1188392567423&pagename=
=3DJPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull#>from
the former Soviet Union as children. "I
intend to explore whether there is a legal possibility to revoke their
citizenship and throw them out of the country," Sheetrit said. "If there is
such a possibility I will not hesitate to do so." "Whoever believes in the
Nazi dogma has no place in the State of Israel," he added. MK Zevulun Orlev
(NU-NRP) is expected to present the Knesset plenum with a bill calling to
revoke the suspects' citizenship. MK Effi Eitam (NU-NRP) said he would
present the plenum with a recommendation to amend the Law of Return. Accord=
ing
to Eitam, people who harbored a hatred of Jews and a hatred of Israel in
their hearts find a safe haven in Israel by taking advantage of a loophole
in the Law of Return. In the past, NU-NRP members have tried to advance
bills that would revoke parts of the Law of Return but have failed. The Law
of Return, which states that one only has to have one Jewish grandparent to
immigrate as a Jew, has allowed thousands of non-halachicly Jewish
descendants of Jews to immigrate to Israel with the same benefits as Jewish
immigrants. Cabinet members on Sunday viewed videos presented by police tha=
t
showed the alleged gang members, faces covered, kicking and punching
helpless citizens, as well as posing with IDF-issued weapons and displaying
"heil Hitler"-style salutes. "I am confident that no one in Israel has
remained indifferent to the images, which can attest to a failure on our
part in educating our youth and keeping them away from disturbed and
dangerous ideologies," Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert<http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=3D1188392567423&pagename=
=3DJPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull#>said
following the video presentation. "We
must handle them=85with the utmost severity," he said. "What we are talking
about is shocking, senseless violence. We must create a deterrence to ensur=
e
that such incidents do not recur." Industry, Trade, and Labor Minister Eli
Yishai said, "These people are not fit to be called people. They are a
cancer." He said the neo-Nazis' citizenship should be revoked. In addition
to the voices advocating a reexamination of the Law
of Return, through which all of the suspects except for one entered
Israeland were granted citizenship, community activists and police
called on MKs
to tighten laws against neo-Nazism. Israel's current legislation, which is
much less stringent than laws in many European countries, does not place
limitations on possession of neo-Nazi paraphernalia. It merely prohibits
propagation of neo-Nazi views via the Internet. It is only on this charge,
as well as the attacks of which they are suspected - and not on a charge of
belonging to a neo-Nazi group - that the suspects are being held. The group
is suspected in a number of attacks, including synagogue desecrations and
brutal beatings in the central part of the country. Nahum Taub, a sexton
(gabbai) of Petah Tikva's central synagogue, Beit Ya'acov, which the gang
allegedly spray-painted with swastikas and crosses a year and a half
ago on Independence
Day, on Sunday said he was personally attacked by two skinheads about two
months ago. "It was a Friday afternoon and I was on my way to the market,"
Taub said. "Suddenly these two teenagers came up to me and screamed, 'Heil
Hitler.' They tried to hurt me but they were drunk and I just pushed them
away." Taub, who grew up in Brooklyn, said he has never felt threatened or
afraid while walking the streets of Petah Tikva. Asked if the skinheads of
Petah Tikva were capable of committing murder, Taub answered, "Maybe, only
God knows."

with the 9/11 anniversary approaching, always remember as
much as black biased media tries to frame bin laden for 9/11
(to justify the genocide of 5000 innocent afghans, 20,000
innocent iraqi's, and the death of over 3,700 US soldiers)
everybody still remembers al quida jinx being the central figure
behind 420 riots in ohio, his gang fleeing to NY, joining the NY
Bloods and bragging the world trade center building would be the
ultimate insurance scam right before west coast black gang
members advertised blowing up the world trade center building
on their gangster hip hop album featuring the song: "5 million
ways to kill a CEO", kofi annan bringing up the topic of
globalization v. anti-globalization at the UN, black gang members
rioting violently in the streets against globalization right before
9/11 that was commited by african terrorists like zacharias
moussaui, the 20th 9/11 hi-jacker from morocco, north africa
*not* afghanistan or iraq!...al quida had just been a code word
for african terrorists the whole time!...

Subject: Pushing Back the Black Horse of Injustice...


preventing the white horse of conquering is one thing, but
the bible also warns against the black horse of injustice...

from Revelation 6...
5 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third
beast <http://www.godrules.net/library/topics/topic180.htm> say, Come and
see. And I beheld, and lo a black
horse<http://www.godrules.net/library/topics/topic956.htm>;

and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his
hand<http://www.godrules.net/library/topics/topic882.htm>
.

since Gonzales is stepping down, and I am the International
Intelligence Director, the primary owner of the US federal
government, the source of everybody working in america's
pay check money, I will oversee all federal investigations...all
federal investigations have to be authorized by either myself
or mueller...those partaking in unauthorized federal investigations
may be fired (especially those initiated by condi at state dept.
using black gang members to spy on VIP's to commit identity
theft, which is against federal law). here are my final judgements
concerning critical american justice issues:

1. 9/11 - since it has been determined that zacharias moussaui,
    the 20th 9/11 hi-jacker came from morocco, north africa,
    just as yussef ramsey, the 1993 WTC bomber came from
   egypt, north africa,  the  spain train  bombers came from
   morocco, north africa, and africa still owes us for blowing
   up our american embassy in kenya and black hawk down.
   africa must pay new york $40 billion for 9/11 in one month
   or i give hayden, CIA director, permission to bomb north africa
.
2. freezing of the west coast ports - $125 billion loss of business
    caused by african americans falsely accusing asian americans
    opium to justify stealing imported japanese cars and causing
    $125 billion dollars loss of business since union port workers
    couldn't work, teamsters truck drivers couldn't work, and stores
    like wal-mart couldn't work.  african americans have 1 month
    to pay asian americans, union port workers, teamsters truck
    drivers, stores like wal-mart, and japanese auto dealerships
    in america who did not recieve their shipments the $125 billion
    for total loss of business or i give the FBI permisssion to bust
    every african american, who benefited from the scam and
    seize and sell all assets and property from african americans,
    who profited from the freezing of the west coast ports.  if any
    african american resists arrest, and decided to shoot any FBI
    agent than the US military or the KKK will be paid $1000
    federal bounty to hunt down the african american murderer

3. california wildfires - 2003 wildfire started by mormons tricked
    by niger, africans, $2 billion dollars property damage and 19
    deaths...mormons and niger, africans owe state of california
    $2 billion dollars and $100,000 for each victim's family.  the
    mormons and the niger, africans have one month to pay or i
    give the FBI and the US military permission to bust all mormons
    and seize and sell all mormon property until debt is paid.
    niger, africa shall have one month to pay $1 billion or i give
    hayden, the CIA director, permission to bomb niger, africa.
    2004 california wildfire - black gang members targeting korean
    and white trailer park neihborhoods for fire attacks.  $2 million
    dollars property damage.  california valley black gang members
    have one month to compensate korean and white trailer park victims
    or i give the FBI, US military, and KKK  permission to hunt down
    black gang members in california at $1000/head.  2005 california
    wildfire - black gangs target german man's house with a burning
    swastika that starts a $400 acre fire near LA, east LA, and ventura
    are burned as well.  LA black gang members owe german man
    $500,000, east LA $1 million, and ventura $1 million. if victims
    are not compensated in one month, i give LA FBI, California National
    Guard, Texas Minutmen permision to hunt down all LA black gang
    members at $1000/head.  2006 fire - white trash targeting east LA,
    ventura, and malibu. white trash owe east LA $1 million, black
    gang owes ventura $1 million, and american tobacco companies
    owe malibu $5 million since that was started by a cigarette.  if
    fines are not paid, i give permission to LA FBI, LAPD, California
    National Guard, and Texas Minutemen permission to hunt down
    the east LA arsonists, ventura arsonists, and malibu arsonists at
    $1000/head.  2007 south lake tahoe fire - undetermined cause,
    sacramento FBI will be paid $1000 for arsonist busted.

4. west nile virus - 300 cases of west nile virus and 12 deaths. dangerous
    mosquitos traced to U.C. Davis, that had been trying to create a west
    nile virus vaccine.  U.C. Davis must cover victim's medical expenses.

5. surplus of nazi style propaganda on TV: treating men, non-whites like
    monkeys and dogs, perverse and wicked rumors, character assasination
    of VIP's, senseless smeer the queer and cootie games.  anybody who
    watches TV may write a letter to the FCC for $1000 fine. fine must be
    paid within one month or the FCC violator will be arrested.  violator
    must pay $1000 bail or do $1000 community service work at $8/hr.
    $500 to go to FCC reporter.  $500 to go to $500 arresting officer.

6.  4 years extreme defamation of character, slander, and loss of wages
     i suffered as a result of mormon, african, and black biased media
outlets
     hate mongering...i am owed $400,000. i must be paid in one month, or
     I give the FBI, US military, and local law enforcement permission to
     hunt down the rumor starters at $1000/head.

7. FBI will be paid $1000 for each african identity thefter that causes
    fraudulent charges on VIP credit cards or illegal withdraw of funds
     they bust and deport back to Africa.

8. other arsonists and FEMA insurance scam artists will be busted by the FBI
,
    US military, local law enforcement, Texas / Minutemen at $1000/head
    and put in federal pen. for 7 years or shall be deported back to Africa.

Al Quida Jinx Kahlil G Robinson originally named Sam Robinson from
Cleveland, Ohio..last seen Columbus, Ohio...associated with the Folk
Nation Gang of Cleveland, which is associated with the Bloods of NY,
of which Zacharias Moussaui, the 20th 9/11 hi-jacker was a part of...
Just as John Allen Williams, the Baltimor Sniper was changed to
John Muhammed to frame arabs...Sam Robinson changed his name to
Kahlil G Robinson...on the news Kahlid Shake Mohammed is used,
because it is innocent until proven guilty and "jinx" claims he has a
reputation to protect because he plays in a band (Burlap Sun)...Jinx's
mother was a member of the Black Panthers that had planned on blowing
up buildings in NY since the 60's....since Jinx was a member of the Folk
Nation Gang, which is associated with Bloods of NY, which is associated
with Fazul Mohammed, who had a $5 million federal bounty on his head
as one of the FBI's most wanted terrorists

http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorists/termohammed.htm

Jinx's myspace site: myspace.com/djmcjinx
(he just logged on his myspace site a few days ago)

his public record file...
http://www.fcmcclerk.com/Pa/pa.urd/pamw2000.o_case_sum?2694545

financial damage caused by Jinx as a member of the Folks in
Cleveland, Ohio

* used his older brother's driver's license to drink at Smart Bar
causing Smart Bar to shut down for a month - $20,000

* trafficked illegal drugs in Metropolis nightclub causing Metropolis
to be shut down for 3 months - $60,000

* his gang robbed CWRU students at gun point at ATM machines
- approximately - $50 x 50 students a year = $2,500 x 7 years =
$17,500

* his gang broke into cars to steal car stereos and sold them at
pawn shops - $50 x 50 cars a year = $2,500 x 7 years = $17,500

* his gang jumped CWRU students to rob them outside of clubs
- $50 x 50 students a year = $2,500 x 7 years = $17,500

* he threw a party in lakewood, ohio and didn't pay the DJ's - $500

* let the record show that jinx had nothing to do with any cleveland
clubs or parties except for the last one mentioned in lakewood
and was nicknamed 'jinx' because he would show up at clubs
or parties and the party would get busted because jinx was there
...it is also well known that jason jinx in NYC is the real jinx and
wanted to kill him, because he was ruining his DJ name.

* let the record show that 'jinx' had nothing to do with the founding
of 'family affair', which was the idea of myself, mike from texas,
sleepy c, brian wheeler, trevor lamont, kevin gank from spawntaneous,
rob sherwood and mike filly from tone deaf and color blind, ed luna
and tony ramos from ele mental...all of which hated jinx, because
jinx was a notorious illegal drug trafficker and increased the chances
of having their party busted just because he showed up.

total financial damage caused by jinx from cleveland, ohio alone:
$133,000 jinx was so hated in cleveland, he was forced to move to
columbus, ohio where he continued his crime activities...

* his gang breaking into and stealing car stereos - $10,000

* his gang trafficking illegal drugs and getting 60% of the OSU population
to drop out and only 20% remain to graduate - 40,000 x $15,000 x 3 yrs
= $1,800,000,000 for 10 years = $180,000,000,000

* his gang killing someone in Red Zone nightclub and causing the club to
be shut down for 3 months = $60,000 + $100,000 loss of life = $160,000

* his gang getting kicked out of Red Zone and starting the 420 Riots -
$1,000,000

total financial damage caused by jinx in columbus, ohio - $180,002,170,000

* jinx's gang flees to NY after the 420 Riots and joins the Bloods of NY
of which Zacharias Moussaui, the 20th 9/11 hi-jacker is associated
with... Jinx boasts the WTC would be the ultimate insurance scam,

California Bloods associated with the band the Coupe show the WTC
getting blown up on their black gangster hip hop album and feature the
song '5 million ways to kill a CEO'...black gangs riots against
globalization
right before 9/11...9/11 happens...total damage including loss of life
and loss of business - $40,000,000,000

total financial damage caused by Al Quida Jinx in NYC - $40,000,000,000

blacks frame bin laden because the bin ladens and the saudi's were the
biggest investor in Bush and the GOP...saudi's orginally had $420 billion
invested in America, after blacks frame Bin Laden using a 5 year old CNN
footage of Bin Laden that was mistranslated and a video of an old black
man dressed as Bin Laden for the confession video, Saudi's pull out
$200 billion. the War on Afghanistan starts, total cost now: $90 billion.

Colin Powell presents a forged document alleging Saddam attempted to
obtain yellow cake (yellow food coloring) to enrich depleted uranium
(give it a yellow color?!) from niger, africa to spark the War on Iraq
when they had nothing to do with 9/11...total cost for War on Iraq
now: $500 billion...total loss of life: over 3,700 US soldiers deaths.

blacks falsely accuse asians of opium (when in reality asians regard
opium as jews regard swastikas since the emperor of china hacked
heads to get it out of china before) causing the freezing of the west
coast ports...total loss of business: $125,000,000,000

black gangs dupe the mormons to hate the mexicans sparking the
2003 california wildfires - $2,000,000,000 property damage and 19
deaths

black gangs target korean neighborhoods and white trash
neighborhoods for fire attacks in 2004 - $1,000,000 damage

black gangs target german american neighborhoods, celebrity
neighborhoods, and republican oil field in cali - $1,000,000,000

black gangs target texas, oklahoma, alabama, and tennessee for fire
attacks as revenge for slow katrina response - $1,000,000,000

TOTAL FINANCIAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY Al QUIDA JINX:
$1,020,003,303,000 ... thats over $1.02 trillion!!

Federal bounty on Al Quida Jinx was originaly $5 million, but I re-allocated
$4.9 million to Katrina victims (ironically, Jinx bragged he briefly joined
the Red Cross during Katrina to skim $1 million dollars from the Red
Cross and funneled it to Africa to import $1 million dollars of Jamaican
cannibis...Katrina struck New Orleans, because it is where Jamaican
cannibis comes into America. God knew Jamaican cannibis trafficking
africans like Al Quida Jinx were responsible for 9/11), so the current
federal bounty on Al Quida Jinx is $100,000. Al Quida Jinx has not
been caught because Columbus has a black mayor and a black police
chief, and corrupt FBI agents like Mike Nees, who take bribe money
from black gang members not to go after black gang members who have
shot their girlfriends, shot cops, and commited horrendous acts of
terrorism like the 420 Riots and 9/11, but instead frame sons of GOP
for blackmail and extorsion schemes.

---

since al quida jinx caused america a $1 trillion dollar federal defecit,
I had to make a mission in 2004 to japan and china to acquire
$1.4 trillion from japanese and chinese investors in US treasury bonds.
this bailed america out of that $1 trillion dollar federal defecit (caused
by war mongering dark tares) and gave america a $400 billion dollar
budget. Bush has spent $200 billion on Katrina, the War on Afghanistan,
and the War on Iraq. This year Bush spent $124 billion on the War on
Iraq, $48 billion for Dems Gobal Warming Agenda, and almost gave the
remaining $30 billion to Africa, before I veto'ed it since it is against
federal law to aid and abett terrorists / terrorist nations. And Africais
definitly considered a terrorist nation since: zacharias moussaui,
the 20th 9/11 hi-jacker, from morocco, north africa was from there,
yussef ramsey, the 1993 WTC bomber, from egypt north africa was
from there, where our american embassy was blown up in kenya,
and where Black Hawk Down occured. As a result, there is approximately
only $28 billion expendable cash left in the Federal Reserve, most of
it spent on the Wars, when I had initially intended for the rebuilding of
the WTC especially since I posted my new WTC plans on my site:
http://adameve3169.orfay.com/?month=02&year=2007

Hitler killed 6 million jews people during WWII. Al Quida Jinx and other
dark tares have ruined 25 million people (over 4 times as many people
as Hitler in a shorter amount of time) of 16 nations of people:

1. America (2,793 dead in NY on 9/11, anthrax attack of the media,
baltimore sniper shooting, $125 billion loss from freezing of west
coast ports, car jackings, california wildfires, west nile virus,
cali drive-by shootings/friendly fire deaths, identity theft scams,etc.)
2. Saudi's (Bin Laden, multiple assasination attempts, damaging
America's OPEC relationship, causing high gas prices, every
time the media gets duped to believe Bin Laden was behind
9/11 by the dark tares, american gas prices shoot up)
3. Afghanistan - $90 billion to kill 5000 innocent afghans that had
nothing to do with 9/11.
4. Iraq - $500 billion and over 3.700 US soldier lives to kill 20,000
iraqi's that had nothing to do with 9/11 al because Colin Powell
presented the forged document from Niger, Africa alleging
Saddam attempted to obtain yellow cake to enrich uranium
from Niger, Africa.
5. Pakistan - missile shot into village to kill Al Zarqwai. He wasn't
there, but it killed 17 innocent civilians.
6. Africa - America deports black gang members on death row to
Africa. They end up killing 1 million people in Africa, mostly in
Sudan / Darfur region.
7. Japan - $125 billion loss during freezing of west coast ports
caused by black gang members falsely accusing asians of
opium to justify confiscating imported japanese cars to keep
for themselves or to sell on the blackmarket. japanese garden
targeted in fresno, california for bio warfare attack, killing 60
koi fish the first time and 53 the second time.
8. China - $500 billion world trade deal between China and US
stalled during freezing of west coast ports caused by black
gang members falsely accusing asians of opium when in
reality asians regard opium as jews regard swastikas ever
since the emperor hacked heads to get opium out of China
before. China just stopped executing illegal drug dealers
less than 20 years ago. I had to make a mission to Japan
and China to restart the $500 billion world trade deal between
US and Asia. I also initiated WTO 2005 in China to get
America $500 billion in new account with China, $100 billion
in new accounts for Africa, $100 billion in new accounts
for Germany, and $100 billion in new accounts for the UK.
9. France - african muslims burned 20 villages in france during
the riots.
10. England - 52 brits were blown up during the London bombings
after Tony Blair tried cutting the $50 billion oil deal China
had with Africa in half since so many terrorists had come
from Africa.
11. Germany - dark tares target gov. schwarzenegger with west
nile virus attack in sacramento, california. they don't get him,
but there have been 300 cases of west nile virus and 12 deaths.
west nile virus originally from, as the name indicates, the nile
region of africa. also where AIDS, anthrax, e.boli, e. coli,
avian bird flu, and malaria come from. black gangs spray
paint swastikas on GOP buildings during Bush's 2004 campaign
trail. black gangs burn swastikas in front of GOP houses.
black gangs burn a swastika in front of a german american house
near LA in 2005 that starts a 400 acre fire. black reporter
accuses a german of being a pedophile for taking a picture
of his daughter and her friends at a Texas oktoberfest.
black gangs attack german americans protesting against
black violence in toledo, ohio with bricks. one brick goes
through the windshield of a police woman's cruiser and
gives her a concussion. security video also shows them
with a professional battering ram trying to break into a
store by a gas station. at the end, the black gangs get
away with it after condi convinces the feds to frame yemeni's
for it when there isn't a single yemeni in the security video
just violent black gang members and yemeni's haven't been
able to get to america since the bombing of the USS Cole.
12. Middle-east - Condi sold $20 billion in arns to Palestine to
increase the violence in the middle-east. most of the friendly
fire deaths in iraq and america were commited by africans
with austrian assault rifles with armour piercing shells that
were sold to africans by germany in a deal that condi
arranged. many of the kidnapping and killings were commited
by dark tares from africa pretending to be arabs.
13. Korea - blacks stage virginia tech shooting and frame a korean
actor for it by shooting him in the head with a 9mm gun with
serial numbers scratched off and fake suicide note just as
they killed 9 women in philadelphia before and tried to make
it appear like they were suicide girls with planted 9mm guns
and fake suicide notes. one woman survived and showed up
on the oprah winfrey show to let the world she did not commit
suicide and was indeed shot by her black gang member boy
friend. black gang members have falsely accused my 'holywood'
of being a super dong missile from korea in an attempt to start
another war with korea for more dark tare war profiteering when
not even john mccaine wants to go back to another war with
korea. in addition, if we attack korea, korea will most likely
attack california. NORAD will shoot missiles at Korea. Russia
may mistake NORAD's missile attack as an attack on Russia
and launches missiles at NYC and DC, nuclear apocalypse!
14. Iran - Condi has been desperately trying to trick Bush and
other world leaders to bomb Iran's nuclear power plants.
unfortunately, If Iran's nulcear power plant is attacked than
there will be a nuclear explosion 10 times worse than chernobyl
that will reach all the way to europe and possibly the east coast!
15. Russia - Condi talks with Putin all the time and may have tricked
him to try to kill Bush when he gave a speech at Georgia former
soviet republic and had a grenade tossed at him by an individual
with a black glove, sign of the Black Panthers. dark tares may
have been responsible for the death of that russian spy killed
by uranium since uranium can be obtained from Africa.
16. Canada - Canada just recently got hit with more cases of west
nile virus than California and as I mentioned, west nile virus, as
the name indicates, originally came from the nile region of
Africa. In fact, the first archaeologist in King Tut's tomb died
from west nile virus, but back then it was thought to be the
"mummy's curse". Immigrant Africans aka Al Quida try to
sneak into America through Canada and Mexico and bring
with them their deadly African diseases, such as: AIDS,
anthrax, e.boli, e.coli, west nile virus, avian bird flu, and malaria.
these may be the seven deadly plagues God cast on Egypt
for turning toward idolatry after the Jews were told to make
an Exodus from Egypt. Jews must learn to stop worshipping
blacks like they are Gods (some of which have tricked jews
and christians to become evil) that is idolatry, but instead seek
the true word of God aka the midrash.

dark tares have ruined 25 million people (over 4 times as many people<br>as Hitler in a shorter amount of time) of 16 nations of people: <br><br>1. America (2,793 dead in NY on 9/11, anthrax attack of the media,
 <br>baltimore sniper shooting, $125 billion loss from freezing of west<br>coast ports, car jackings, california wildfires, west nile virus, <br>cali drive-by shootings/friendly fire deaths, identity theft scams,etc.)<br>
2. Saudi&#39;s (Bin Laden, multiple assasination attempts, damaging<br>America&#39;s OPEC relationship, causing high gas prices, every<br>time the media gets duped to believe Bin Laden was behind<br>9/11 by the dark tares, american gas prices shoot up)
<br>3. Afghanistan - $90 billion to kill 5000 innocent afghans that had<br>nothing to do with 9/11.<br>4. Iraq - $500 billion and over 3.700 US soldier lives to kill 20,000 <br>iraqi&#39;s that had nothing to do with 9/11 al because Colin Powell

<br>8. China - $500 billion world trade deal between China and US<br>stalled during freezing of west coast ports caused by black<br>gang members falsely accusing asians of opium when in<br>reality asians regard opium as jews regard swastikas ever
<br>since the emperor hacked heads to get opium out of China<br>before. China just stopped executing illegal drug dealers<br>less than 20 years ago. I had to make a mission to Japan <br>and China to restart the $500

<br>had with Africa in half since so many terrorists had come<br>from Africa.<br>11. Germany - dark tares target gov. schwarzenegger with west<br>nile virus attack in sacramento, california. they don&#39;t get him,<br>but there have been 300 cases of west nile virus and 12 deaths.
<br>west nile virus originally from, as the name indicates, the nile<br>region of africa. also where AIDS, anthrax, e.boli, e. coli, <br>avian bird flu, and malaria come from. black gangs spray<br>paint swastikas on GOP
 buildings during Bush&#39;s 2004 campaign<br>trail. black gangs burn swastikas in front of GOP houses.<br>black gangs burn a swastika in front of a german american house <br>near LA in 2005 that starts a 400 acre fire. black reporter

<br>through the windshield of a police woman&#39;s cruiser and<br>gives her a concussion. security video also shows them <br>with a professional battering ram trying to break into a<br>store by a gas station. at the end, the black gangs get 
<br>away with it after condi convinces the feds to frame yemeni&#39;s<br>for it when there isn&#39;t a single yemeni in the security video<br>just violent black gang members and yemeni&#39;s haven&#39;t been<br>able to get to america since the bombing of the USS Cole.

<br>were sold to africans by germany in a deal that condi <br>arranged. many of the kidnapping and killings were commited<br>by dark tares from africa pretending to be arabs.<br>13. Korea - blacks stage virginia tech shooting and frame a korean
<br>actor for it by shooting him in the head with a 9mm gun with<br>serial numbers scratched off and fake suicide note just as<br>they killed 9 women in philadelphia before and tried to make <br>it appear like they were suicide girls with planted 9mm guns
<br>and fake suicide notes. one woman survived and showed up<br>on the oprah winfrey show to let the world she did not commit<br>suicide and was indeed shot by her black gang member boy<br>friend. black gang members have falsely accused my &#39;holywood&#39;
 <br>of being a super dong missile from korea in an attempt to start<br>another war with korea for more dark tare war profiteering when<br>not even john mccaine wants to go back to another war with<br>korea. in addition, if we attack korea, korea will most likely
<br>attack california. NORAD will shoot missiles at Korea. Russia <br>may mistake NORAD&#39;s missile attack as an attack on Russia <br>and launches missiles at NYC and DC, nuclear apocalypse!<br>14. Iran - Condi has been desperately trying to trick Bush and
<br>other world leaders to bomb Iran&#39;s nuclear power plants.<br>unfortunately, If Iran&#39;s nulcear power plant is attacked than<br>there will be a nuclear explosion 10 times worse than chernobyl<br>that will reach all the way to europe and possibly the east coast!
<br>15. Russia - Condi talks with Putin all the time and may have tricked<br>him to try to kill Bush when he gave a speech at Georgia former<br>soviet republic and had a grenade tossed at him by an
 individual<br>with a black glove, sign of the Black Panthers. dark tares may<br>have been responsible for the death of that russian spy killed<br>by uranium since uranium can be obtained from Africa.<br>16. Canada - Canada just recently got hit with more cases of west
<br>nile virus than California and as I mentioned, west nile virus, as<br>the name indicates, originally came from the nile region of<br>Africa. In fact, the first archaeologist in King Tut&#39;s tomb died<br>from west nile virus, but back then it was thought to be the
<br>&quot;mummy&#39;s curse&quot;. Immigrant Africans aka Al Quida try to<br>sneak into America through Canada and Mexico and bring<br>with them their deadly African diseases, such as: AIDS,<br>anthrax, e.boli, e.coli, west nile virus, avian bird flu, and malaria.
<br>these may be the seven deadly plagues God cast on Egypt <br>for turning toward idolatry after the Jews were told to make<br>an Exodus from Egypt. Jews must learn to stop worshipping<br>blacks like
 they are Gods (some of which have tricked jews<br>and christians to become evil) that is idolatry, but instead seek <br>the true word of God aka the midrash.

Colin
Powell: Terrorists are not greatest threat to nation  [image:
Powellingq]<http://blogs.usatoday.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/10/powellingq.jpg>In
an interview with
*GQ *magazine that's scheduled to be put online here at 11 a.m.
ET<http://men.style.com/gq>,
former secretary of State and one-time potential presidential candidate Colin
Powell has this to say about terrorism and the threat it poses to the USA:
"What is the greatest threat facing us now? People will say it's terrorism.
But are there any terrorists in the world who can change the American way of
life or our political system? No. Can they knock down a building? Yes. Can
they kill somebody? Yes. But can they change us? No. Only we can change
ourselves. So what is the great threat we are facing?"
Powell adds, in an interview with Walter Isaacson, that to improve its image
in the world, the USA should focus on welcoming newcomers. He takes on the
immigration debate that has become a hot-button issue in the presidential
race:
 "America could not survive without immigration," he says. "Even the
undocumented immigrants are contributing to our economy. That's the country
my parents came to. That's the image we have to portray to the rest of the
world: kind, generous, a nation of nations, touched by every nation, and we
touch every nation in return. That's what people still want to believe about
us. They still want to come here. We've lost a bit of the image, but we
haven't lost the reality yet. And we can fix the image by reflecting a
welcoming attitude -- and by not taking counsel of our fears and scaring
ourselves to death that everybody coming in is going to blow up something.
It ain't the case."
As for the Iraq War, Powell -- a retired general and former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff -- tells Isaacson that as he and others in the Bush
administration debated strategy in the lead-up to the war, he did not think
the Pentagon and then-secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had planned for
what would happen after Baghdad fell.
"That was the big mistake. Don had written a list of the worst things that
could happen, but we didn't do the contingency planning on what we would do
about it. So we watched those buildings get burned down, and nobody told the
divisions, 'Hey, go in there and declare martial law and whack a few people
and it will stop.' Then the insurgency started, and we didn't acknowledge
it. They said it wasn't an insurgency. They looked up the definition. They
said it was a few dead-enders! And so we didn't respond in a way that might
have stopped it. And then the civil war started at the beginning of last
year. I call it a civil war, but some say no, it's not a civil war, it's a
war against civilians. In fact, we have total civil disorder."
Also today,* GQ* has already posted a lengthy interview with
Rumsfeld<http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5896>.
Author Lisa DePaulo sums up her conclusions this way:
"If you're expecting Don Rumsfeld -- out of government now, on his farm, in
a moment of repose -- to play the bitter, angry, reflective, tragic fallen
hero ... ain't gonna happen. If he feels any of those things, he's not
showing it. (And if he did, he probably wouldn't be Donald H. Rumsfeld.) The
man does not do regret. Over the course of the next few hours, he will
answer every question asked of him, and even when the answer is 'I'm not
gonna talk about that,' there's never a flash of anger. Impatience, yes, but
never anger."

most likely in lieu of my recent revelation that most terrorism in america

commited by africans or african americans, colin powell confesses that

terrorists are not greatest threat to nation, but never apologizes for the

fact that it was his blatant lie in front of the UN that launched the pre-

emptive strike on Iraq that has cost over 3,700 US soldiers thier lives

now.  I think most soldier families whose sons or daughters that died in

Iraq were expecting a little bit more from colin powell.


but what is eeriest of his interview was his quote: 'Hey, go in there and

declare martial law and whack a few people and it will stop.', sounds

disturbingly like what had happened during the baltimore sniper shooting

(which coincidentally turned out to be a former gulf war veteran pretending

to be an arab) and the recent virginia tech shooting.  one seriously starts

to ponder was powell part of the plan for terrorist attacks in america to

justify war on afghanistan, war on iraq, and possibly future wars with

iran and korea for more dark tare war profiteering costing america billions

of dollars at a time and thousands of US soldier lives?!   Powell was a

great war general, but no general, no military recruiter likes seeing so

many US troops die over a lie.  was al quida jinx, a former army ranger

pretending to be arab, also part of powell's plan for planned terrorism in

america to justify foreign wars for war profiteering?!...

Cleveland, Ohio

* used his older brother's driver's license to drink at Smart Bar
causing Smart Bar to shut down for a month - $20,000

* trafficked illegal drugs in Metropolis nightclub causing Metropolis
to be shut down for 3 months - $60,000

- $50 x 50 students a year = $2,500 x 7 years = $17,500

* he threw a party in lakewood, ohio and didn't pay the DJ's - $500

* let the record show that jinx had nothing to do with any cleveland

or parties and the party would get busted because jinx was there
...it is also well known that jason jinx in NYC is the real jinx and
wanted to kill him, because he was ruining his DJ name.

* let the record show that 'jinx' had nothing to do with the founding
of 'family affair', which was the idea of myself, mike from texas,
sleepy c, brian wheeler, trevor lamont, kevin gank from spawntaneous,
rob sherwood and mike filly from tone deaf and color blind, ed luna
and tony ramos from ele mental...all of which hated jinx, because
jinx was a notorious illegal drug trafficker and increased the chances
of having their party busted just because he showed up.

total financial damage caused by jinx from cleveland, ohio alone:
$133,000 jinx was so hated in cleveland, he was forced to move to
columbus, ohio where he continued his crime activities...

* his gang killing someone in Red Zone nightclub and causing the club to
be shut down for 3 months = $60,000 + $100,000 loss of life = $160,000

* his gang getting kicked out of Red Zone and starting the 420 Riots -
$1,000,000

total financial damage caused by jinx in columbus, ohio - $180,002,170,000

* jinx's gang flees to NY after the 420 Riots and joins the Bloods of NY
of which Zacharias Moussaui, the 20th 9/11 hi-jacker is associated
with... Jinx boasts the WTC would be the ultimate insurance scam,

California Bloods associated with the band the Coupe show the WTC
getting blown up on their black gangster hip hop album and feature the
song '5 million ways to kill a CEO'...black gangs riots against
globalization
right before 9/11...9/11 happens...total damage including loss of life

footage of Bin Laden that was mistranslated and a video of an old black
man dressed as Bin Laden for the confession video, Saudi's pull out
$200 billion. the War on Afghanistan starts, total cost now: $90 billion.

Colin Powell presents a forged document alleging Saddam attempted to
obtain yellow cake (yellow food coloring) to enrich depleted uranium
(give it a yellow color?!) from niger, africa to spark the War on Iraq
when they had nothing to do with 9/11...total cost for War on Iraq
now: $500 billion...total loss of life: over 3,700 US soldiers deaths.

blacks falsely accuse asians of opium (when in reality asians regard
opium as jews regard swastikas since the emperor of china hacked
heads to get it out of china before) causing the freezing of the west
coast ports...total loss of business: $125,000,000,000

</a> In an interview with <em>GQ </em>magazine that&#39;s scheduled to be <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://men.style.com/gq"><span id="lw_1189503143_1">put online here at 11 a.m. ET</span></a>,
 former secretary of State and one-time potential presidential candidate <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer; height: 1em;" id="lw_1189503143_2">Colin Powell</span> has this to say about terrorism and the threat it poses to the USA:
</div>  <div>&quot;What
is the greatest threat facing us now? People will say it&#39;s terrorism.
But are there any terrorists in the world who can change the American
way of life or our political system? No. Can they knock down a
building? Yes. Can they kill somebody? Yes. But can they change us? No.
Only we can change ourselves. So what is the great threat we are
facing?&quot;</div>  <div>Powell adds, in an interview with Walter Isaacson, that to improve its image in the world, the <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer; height: 1em;" id="lw_1189503143_3">
USA</span>
should focus on welcoming newcomers. He takes on the immigration debate
that has become a hot-button issue in the presidential race:</div></div>  <div class="entry-more">  <div>&quot;America
could not survive without immigration,&quot; he says. &quot;Even the undocumented
immigrants are contributing to our economy. That&#39;s the country my
parents came to. That&#39;s the image we have to portray to the rest of the
world: kind, generous, a nation of nations, touched by every nation,
and we touch every nation in return. That&#39;s what people still want to
believe about us. They still want to come here. We&#39;ve lost a bit of the
image, but we haven&#39;t lost the reality yet. And we can fix the image by
reflecting a welcoming attitude -- and by not taking counsel of our
fears and scaring ourselves to death that everybody coming in is going
to blow up something. It ain&#39;t the case.&quot;</div>  <div>As
for the Iraq War, Powell -- a retired general and former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- tells Isaacson that as he and others in
the Bush administration debated strategy in the lead-up to the war, he
did not think the <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer; height: 1em;" id="lw_1189503143_4">Pentagon</span> and then-secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had planned for what would happen after 
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer; height: 1em;" id="lw_1189503143_5">Baghdad</span> fell. </div>  <div>&quot;That
was the big mistake. Don had written a list of the worst things that
could happen, but we didn&#39;t do the contingency planning on what we
would do about it. So we watched those buildings get burned down, and
nobody told the divisions, &#39;Hey, go in there and declare martial law
and whack a few people and it will stop.&#39; Then the insurgency started,
and we didn&#39;t acknowledge it. They said it wasn&#39;t an insurgency. They
looked up the definition. They said it was a few dead-enders! And so we
didn&#39;t respond in a way that might have stopped it. And then the civil
war started at the beginning of last year. I call it a civil war, but
some say no, it&#39;s not a civil war, it&#39;s a war against civilians. In
fact, we have total civil disorder.&quot;</div>  <div>Also today,<em> GQ</em> has already posted <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5896"><span id="lw_1189503143_6">

 spiritual love...
[image: Closer - Closer - Natalie Portman - Flixster Photo]

this photograph of natalie portman from the film 'closer',
describes spiritual love.

zionist jews believe that zion is a new jerusalem, a new
heaven and a new earth prophesized in revelation.  this
is why i had declared vegas a new zion at one point,
since the fountain of living water seemed to fulfill
biblical prophecy.

jesus christ described the kingdom of god as not on earth,
but a spiritual kingdom.

and since God is love, God's spiritual kingdom is a kingdom
of peace and love.

this is why the underground magazine i did before was PLRM,
peace, love, rave, magazine.

love is free and unconditional.

love parade SF, now known as love fest SF, is free and
unconditional.

although i initiated Love Parade SF as an anniversary party
for the founding of the UN, i never intended it to be a one
world government like the UN, instead i wanted it to be
a continuation of the underground rapture i started in ohio
in 1984.

for more information concerning love parade SF, now known
as love fest SF, check my blog on my site: myspace.com/rapture3169

 SF LOVEFEST 2006 WRAP-UP

San Francisco felt the LOVE and so did the *65,000* people that showed up at
SF LoveFest 2006.* 23* floats, *25* sound systems, *200+* DJs gigging,
*1 *spectacular
City Hall, *1* marriage ceremony, countless unofficial after parties
and *1*gigantic official after event with over
*9,000* in attendance, and * 0* problems.


"We are extremely excited about the success of SF Lovefest 2006. After a
challenging year of planning, in a short time frame, to see this event come
off as well as it did was an amazing feat and a fantastic outcome.",
said*Joshua Smith, SF LoveFest Board President.
*"It is a testament to the community who have supported us from the
beginning and who said repeatedly, that we could call it what we wanted as
long as there was a parade and festival to be had. It was an incredible
feeling to look out over the sea of people in attendance. Our mission seemed
fulfilled at that one extraordinary moment; to create a place and event
where people from diverse backgrounds and walks of life, could come together
under one unifying umbrella - SF LoveFest 2006.This event wouldn't have been
what it was without the volunteers, the City of San Francisco, the artists
and float/event producers, or the people who participated, and we are
thankful to them all."

*"It really knocked me out. It was my first time in San Francisco and the
city truly swept me away. Colorful, beautiful people just rocked and rocked
and rocked." **Benny Benassi*

*"The Lovefest represents what the electronic music scene is about - a
community of people inspired by music, which enables us to create and
achieve the unbelievable. It is a moment in life that will always be
remembered. I would like to give my respect to everyone who participated in
the production of this event, to the artists that performed, to the those
that attended and especially to the City of San Francisco for allowing us to
create this celebration. Your cooperation and respect are
appreciated."** **Christopher
Lawrence*

*"Great crowd. Very strong event with great production. It was wonderful to
be a part of it." **Paul Oakenfold*

*"San Francisco LoveFest is the most chaotic, euphoric, unmissable party
event on our calendar! Where else can you see Above & Beyond, Paul Oakenfold
and naked men on roller skates all in one day??" **Above & Beyond*

*"Lovefest was better than ever this year. The buzz at the event was
electric and I cannot imagine a much better city in America to throw such an
event. I met people from all over the country that had flown in for the
event and they were all blown away to say the least. It's one of the best
festivals America has going at the moment and it seems to keep getting
better!" **DJ Dan**
*

 Before the Parade set off down Market St., it received the blessing of none
other then Love Parade Founder, Dr. Motte. He gave a proper keynote speech
that empowered each individual within the parade to recognize all of the
event's participants as a complete community. From the DJs to the visual
artists, the city workers at the event to ensure safety, and the hundreds of
volunteers and organizers who had worked so diligently to make this event a
reality, it brought them all together under SF LoveFest.

At the Civic Center Plaza, Grandmaster Flash gave the audience a performance
showcasing his love for the DJ culture; Above & Beyond dished out their
special form of trance; Bad Boy Bill whipped the crowd with his Chicago
signature sound; DJ Rap housed it, DJ Dan worked it; the Opel/Qool crew
brought world class breakbeat; the SF locals showcased their specialty - a
little bit of all of it is the classiest form; and there were so many more
performances that deserve standing ovations. It was apparent to all that
this event was not just for the fans, as the artists were having more than a
bit of fun themselves!

San Francisco has something special on its hands, perhaps this is due to the
history of the city and the community able to embrace and accept diversity.
>From the mayor to the police officers, the citizens, the rich traditions of
music and festivals and the amazing art community, this city is the perfect
home to this event. But this event wasn't just about the party. It was also
about a message of love and respect and cooperation through the vehicle of
dance music. Which will sustain the participants long past the last record
that was played...

 Quote of Support from Loveparade Berlin Founder Dr Motte

"If you had experienced the Loveparade in San Francisco the last 2 years and
have tasted the Rapture at its heart, then you will know something of what
is coming. The new San Francisco LoveFest experience is at the very heart of
the dance culture phenomenon that is spreading rapidly and unstoppable
around the world. It is about LOVE and it is about FREEDOM. It is about
remembering Who We Really Are and why we are here. The San Francisco
LoveFest itself is part of a much wider personal, social and spiritual
transformation-revolution which will utterly change our world over the
coming decades. Our very ideas about who we are and what we are capable of
are about to be turned upside down. With this next evolution of the event,
we are about to take a step into a different future in which all that is
best and most beautiful in the human soul will find the right conditions to
flower.

THIS IS OUR FUTURE. OPEN YOUR HEART ... FREE YOUR MIND ... FACE YOUR
FEARS... LIVE YOUR SOUL ... DANCE!"
- Dr. Motte, Founder: Loveparade Berlin

The San Francisco LoveFest is an volunteer non-profit organization. Any
profits made from the event go back into next year's event and to
participating non-profit organizations. This year's event is a new event
that takes into account our alignment with the original vision of the
Loveparade events, our experience throwing them the last 2 years, and makes
it our own. That vision of a free parade that celebrates music, love,
diversity, tolerance, dance, and community is something we believe in
strongly, and believe America needs now more than ever. Dance music has
always had a special ability to bring people together in the shared beauty
of a universal vibe. Our community by and large remains 'underground' in U.S.
pop culture due to very little support from radio and MTV, etc. We know that
in a culture awash in conflict, materialism, superficial concerns, and
greed, an event of this kind can lift the spirits and the hopes of those who
to surrender to it's power. The power of dance. The power of music. The
power of community. We're taking it to the streets letting the vibe and the
cooperation and respect of the people taking part in it be a message of hope
in dark times. We intend to make the event a platform for dance music to
reach more ears in America and beyond, to carry a message of love and hope,
to be a vehicle for helping organizations doing good in the world, and for
dancing our asses off surrounded by friendly freaks. See you in the streets.

<h2><font size="2">
<span>Quote of Support from Loveparade Berlin Founder Dr Motte</span></font></h2>
<p><font size="2">&quot;If you had experienced the Loveparade in San
Francisco the last 2 years and have tasted the Rapture at its heart,
then you will know something of what is coming. The new San Francisco
LoveFest experience is at the very heart of the dance culture
phenomenon that is spreading rapidly and unstoppable around the world.
It is about LOVE and it is about FREEDOM. It is about remembering Who
We Really Are and why we are here. The San Francisco LoveFest itself is
part of a much wider personal, social and spiritual
transformation-revolution which will utterly change our world over the
coming decades. Our very ideas about who we are and what we are capable
of are about to be turned upside down. With this next evolution of the
event, we are about to take a step into a different future in which all
that is best and most beautiful in the human soul will find the right
conditions to flower.<br><br>THIS IS OUR FUTURE. OPEN YOUR HEART ... FREE YOUR MIND ... FACE YOUR FEARS... LIVE YOUR SOUL ... DANCE!&quot;<br>- Dr. Motte, Founder: Loveparade Berlin</font></p><font size="2"><a name="114f3db2ef851d78_values">

</a></font>
<h2><font size="2">

  
  
  
</font></h2>
<p><font size="2">The San Francisco LoveFest is an volunteer non-profit
organization. Any profits made from the event go back into next year&#39;s
event and to participating non-profit organizations. This year&#39;s event
is a new event that takes into account our alignment with the original
vision of the Loveparade events, our experience throwing them the last
2 years, and makes it our own. That vision of a free parade that
celebrates music, love, diversity, tolerance, dance, and community is
something we believe in strongly, and believe America needs now more
than ever. Dance music has always had a special ability to bring people
together in the shared beauty of a universal vibe. Our community by and
large remains &#39;underground&#39; in U.S. pop culture due to very little
support from radio and MTV, etc. We know that in a culture awash in
conflict, materialism, superficial concerns, and greed, an event of
this kind can lift the spirits and the hopes of those who to surrender
to it&#39;s power. The power of dance. The power of music. The power of
community. We&#39;re taking it to the streets letting the vibe and the
cooperation and respect of the people taking part in it be a message of
hope in dark times. We intend to make the event a platform for dance
music to reach more ears in America and beyond, to carry a message of
love and hope, to be a vehicle for helping organizations doing good in
the world, and for dancing our asses off surrounded by friendly freaks.
See you in the streets.</font></p><font size="2"><a name="114f3db2ef851d78_get_involved"></a></font>

SF LOVEFEST 2006 WRAP-UP

San Francisco felt the LOVE and so did the *65,000* people that showed up at
SF LoveFest 2006.* 23* floats, *25* sound systems, *200+* DJs gigging,
*1 *spectacular
City Hall, *1* marriage ceremony, countless unofficial after parties
and *1*gigantic official after event with over
*9,000* in attendance, and * 0* problems.



"We are extremely excited about the success of SF Lovefest 2006. After a
challenging year of planning, in a short time frame, to see this event come
off as well as it did was an amazing feat and a fantastic outcome.",
said*Joshua Smith, SF LoveFest Board President.
*"It is a testament to the community who have supported us from the
beginning and who said repeatedly, that we could call it what we wanted as
long as there was a parade and festival to be had. It was an incredible
feeling to look out over the sea of people in attendance. Our mission seemed
fulfilled at that one extraordinary moment; to create a place and event
where people from diverse backgrounds and walks of life, could come together
under one unifying umbrella - SF LoveFest 2006.This event wouldn't have been
what it was without the volunteers, the City of San Francisco, the artists
and float/event producers, or the people who participated, and we are
thankful to them all."

*"It really knocked me out. It was my first time in San Francisco and the
city truly swept me away. Colorful, beautiful people just rocked and rocked
and rocked." **Benny Benassi*

*"The Lovefest represents what the electronic music scene is about - a
community of people inspired by music, which enables us to create and
achieve the unbelievable. It is a moment in life that will always be
remembered. I would like to give my respect to everyone who participated in
the production of this event, to the artists that performed, to the those
that attended and especially to the City of San Francisco for allowing us to
create this celebration. Your cooperation and respect are
appreciated."** **Christopher
Lawrence*

*"Great crowd. Very strong event with great production. It was wonderful to
be a part of it." **Paul Oakenfold*

*"San Francisco LoveFest is the most chaotic, euphoric, unmissable party
event on our calendar! Where else can you see Above & Beyond, Paul Oakenfold
and naked men on roller skates all in one day??" **Above & Beyond*

*"Lovefest was better than ever this year. The buzz at the event was
electric and I cannot imagine a much better city in America to throw such an
event. I met people from all over the country that had flown in for the
event and they were all blown away to say the least. It's one of the best
festivals America has going at the moment and it seems to keep getting
better!" **DJ Dan**
*



Before the Parade set off down Market St., it received the blessing of none
other then Love Parade Founder, Dr. Motte. He gave a proper keynote speech
that empowered each individual within the parade to recognize all of the
event's participants as a complete community. From the DJs to the visual
artists, the city workers at the event to ensure safety, and the hundreds of
volunteers and organizers who had worked so diligently to make this event a
reality, it brought them all together under SF LoveFest.

At the Civic Center Plaza, Grandmaster Flash gave the audience a performance
showcasing his love for the DJ culture; Above & Beyond dished out their
special form of trance; Bad Boy Bill whipped the crowd with his
Chicagosignature sound; DJ Rap housed it, DJ
Dan worked it; the Opel/Qool crew brought world class breakbeat; the SF
locals showcased their specialty - a little bit of all of it is the
classiest form; and there were so many more performances that deserve
standing ovations. It was apparent to all that this event was not just for
the fans, as the artists were having more than a bit of fun themselves!

San Francisco has something special on its hands, perhaps this is due to the
history of the city and the community able to embrace and accept diversity.
>From the mayor to the police officers, the citizens, the rich traditions of
music and festivals and the amazing art community, this city is the perfect
home to this event. But this event wasn't just about the party. It was also
about a message of love and respect and cooperation through the vehicle of
dance music. Which will sustain the participants long past the last record
that was played...

 Quote of Support from Loveparade Berlin Founder Dr Motte

"If you had experienced the Loveparade in San Francisco the last 2 years and
have tasted the Rapture at its heart, then you will know something of what
is coming. The new San Francisco LoveFest experience is at the very heart of
the dance culture phenomenon that is spreading rapidly and unstoppable
around the world. It is about LOVE and it is about FREEDOM. It is about
remembering Who We Really Are and why we are here. The San Francisco
LoveFest itself is part of a much wider personal, social and spiritual
transformation-revolution which will utterly change our world over the
coming decades. Our very ideas about who we are and what we are capable of
are about to be turned upside down. With this next evolution of the event,
we are about to take a step into a different future in which all that is
best and most beautiful in the human soul will find the right conditions to
flower.

THIS IS OUR FUTURE. OPEN YOUR HEART ... FREE YOUR MIND ... FACE YOUR
FEARS... LIVE YOUR SOUL ... DANCE!"
- Dr. Motte, Founder: Loveparade Berlin

The San Francisco LoveFest is an volunteer non-profit organization. Any
profits made from the event go back into next year's event and to
participating non-profit organizations. This year's event is a new event
that takes into account our alignment with the original vision of the
Loveparade events, our experience throwing them the last 2 years, and makes
it our own. That vision of a free parade that celebrates music, love,
diversity, tolerance, dance, and community is something we believe in
strongly, and believe America needs now more than ever. Dance music has
always had a special ability to bring people together in the shared beauty
of a universal vibe. Our community by and large remains 'underground' in U.S.
pop culture due to very little support from radio and MTV, etc. We know that
in a culture awash in conflict, materialism, superficial concerns, and
greed, an event of this kind can lift the spirits and the hopes of those who
to surrender to it's power. The power of dance. The power of music. The
power of community. We're taking it to the streets letting the vibe and the
cooperation and respect of the people taking part in it be a message of hope
in dark times. We intend to make the event a platform for dance music to
reach more ears in America and beyond, to carry a message of love and hope,
to be a vehicle for helping organizations doing good in the world, and for
dancing our asses off surrounded by friendly freaks. See you in the streets.

 Quote of Support from Loveparade Berlin Founder Dr Motte

"If you had experienced the Loveparade in San Francisco the last 2 years and
have tasted the Rapture at its heart, then you will know something of what
is coming. The new San Francisco LoveFest experience is at the very heart of
the dance culture phenomenon that is spreading rapidly and unstoppable
around the world. It is about LOVE and it is about FREEDOM. It is about
remembering Who We Really Are and why we are here. The San
FranciscoLoveFest itself is part of a much wider personal, social and
spiritual
transformation-revolution which will utterly change our world over the
coming decades. Our very ideas about who we are and what we are capable of
are about to be turned upside down. With this next evolution of the event,
we are about to take a step into a different future in which all that is
best and most beautiful in the human soul will find the right conditions to
flower.

THIS IS OUR FUTURE. OPEN YOUR HEART ... FREE YOUR MIND ... FACE YOUR
FEARS... LIVE YOUR SOUL ... DANCE!"
- Dr. Motte, Founder: Loveparade Berlin

The San Francisco LoveFest is an volunteer non-profit organization. Any
profits made from the event go back into next year's event and to
participating non-profit organizations. This year's event is a new event
that takes into account our alignment with the original vision of the
Loveparade events, our experience throwing them the last 2 years, and makes
it our own. That vision of a free parade that celebrates music, love,
diversity, tolerance, dance, and community is something we believe in
strongly, and believe America needs now more than ever. Dance music has
always had a special ability to bring people together in the shared beauty
of a universal vibe. Our community by and large remains 'underground' in U.S.
pop culture due to very little support from radio and MTV, etc. We know that
in a culture awash in conflict, materialism, superficial concerns, and
greed, an event of this kind can lift the spirits and the hopes of those who
to surrender to it's power. The power of dance. The power of music. The
power of community. We're taking it to the streets letting the vibe and the
cooperation and respect of the people taking part in it be a message of hope
in dark times. We intend to make the event a platform for dance music to
reach more ears in America and beyond, to carry a message of love and hope,
to be a vehicle for helping organizations doing good in the world, and for
dancing our asses off surrounded by friendly freaks. See you in the streets.

<h3><font size="2">SF LOVEFEST 2006 WRAP-UP</font></h3>
<p><font size="2">San Francisco felt the LOVE and so did the <strong>65,000</strong> people that showed up at SF LoveFest 2006.<strong> 23</strong> floats, <strong>25</strong> sound systems, <strong>200+</strong> DJs gigging, 
<strong>1 </strong>spectacular City Hall, <strong>1</strong> marriage ceremony, countless unofficial after parties and <strong>1</strong> gigantic official after event with over <strong>9,000</strong> in attendance, and 
<strong>
0</strong> problems. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2"><br>
</font></p><font size="2"><br>&quot;We
are extremely excited about the success of SF Lovefest 2006. After a
challenging year of planning, in a short time frame, to see this event
come off as well as it did was an amazing feat and a fantastic
outcome.&quot;, said<strong> Joshua Smith, SF LoveFest Board President.</strong>&quot;It
is a testament to the community who have supported us from the
beginning and who said repeatedly, that we could call it what we wanted
as long as there was a parade and festival to be had. It was an
incredible feeling to look out over the sea of people in attendance.
Our mission seemed fulfilled at that one extraordinary moment; to
create a place and event where people from diverse backgrounds and
walks of life, could come together under one unifying umbrella - SF
LoveFest 2006.This event wouldn&#39;t have been what it was without the
volunteers, the City of San Francisco, the artists and float/event
producers, or the people who participated, and we are thankful to them
all.&quot; </font>
<p><font size="2"><em><strong>&quot;It really knocked me out. It was my
first time in San Francisco and the city truly swept me away. Colorful,
beautiful people just rocked and rocked and rocked.&quot; </strong></em><strong>Benny Benassi</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><em><strong>&quot;The Lovefest represents what the
electronic music scene is about - a community of people inspired by
music, which enables us to create and achieve the unbelievable. It is a
moment in life that will always be remembered. I would like to give my
respect to everyone who participated in the production of this event,
to the artists that performed, to the those that attended and
especially to the City of San Francisco for allowing us to create this
celebration. Your cooperation and respect are appreciated.&quot;</strong></em><strong> </strong><strong>Christopher Lawrence</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><em><strong>&quot;Great crowd. Very strong event with great production. It was wonderful to be a part of it.&quot; </strong></em><strong>Paul Oakenfold</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><em><strong>&quot;<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer; height: 1em;" id="lw_1189505066_17">San Francisco</span> LoveFest is the most
chaotic, euphoric, unmissable party event on our calendar! Where else
can you see Above &amp; Beyond, Paul Oakenfold and naked men on roller
skates all in one day??&quot; </strong></em><strong>Above &amp; Beyond</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><em><strong>&quot;Lovefest was better than
ever this year. The buzz at the event was electric and I cannot imagine
a much better city in America to throw such an event. I met people from
all over the country that had flown in for the event and they were all
blown away to say the least. It&#39;s one of the best festivals America has
going at the moment and it seems to keep getting better!&quot; </strong></em><strong><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer; height: 1em;" id="lw_1189505066_18">DJ Dan</span></strong><em>
<strong><br></strong></em></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;<br></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Before the Parade set off down Market St., it
received the blessing of none other then Love Parade Founder, Dr.
Motte. He gave a proper keynote speech that empowered each individual
within the parade to recognize all of the event&#39;s participants as a
complete community. From the DJs to the visual artists, the city
workers at the event to ensure safety, and the hundreds of volunteers
and organizers who had worked so diligently to make this event a
reality, it brought them all together under SF LoveFest. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">At the Civic Center Plaza, Grandmaster Flash gave the
audience a performance showcasing his love for the DJ culture; Above
&amp; Beyond dished out their special form of trance; Bad Boy Bill
whipped the crowd with his <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer; height: 1em;" id="lw_1189505066_19">Chicago</span> signature sound; DJ Rap housed it,
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer; height: 1em;" id="lw_1189505066_20">DJ Dan</span> worked it; the Opel/Qool crew brought world class breakbeat; the
SF locals showcased their specialty - a little bit of all of it is the
classiest form; and there were so many more performances that deserve
standing ovations. It was apparent to all that this event was not just
for the fans, as the artists were having more than a bit of fun
themselves! </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer; height: 1em;" id="lw_1189505066_21">San Francisco</span> has something special on its hands,
perhaps this is due to the history of the city and the community able
to embrace and accept diversity. From the mayor to the police officers,
the citizens, the rich traditions of music and festivals and the
amazing art community, this city is the perfect home to this event. But
this event wasn&#39;t just about the party. It was also about a message of
love and respect and cooperation through the vehicle of dance music.
Which will sustain the participants long past the last record that was
played... </font></p>

Stevie T I can't believe you haven't been diagnosed with psychosis yet.Take 
it from me I myself am a "rave casualty" and I am diagnosed psychotic disorder 
NOS. You need help 700 mg seroquel brought me back to reality but I think you 
may need something more serious like Thorazine.How can someone so intelligent 
believe in x-tianty is beyond me.I spent 9 months in prison on the "psych pod" 
where I got a first class education in psychotic disorders.You should do some 
research into delusional disorders.For the longest time I was against meds 
but they really would help you.I'm not tryin to be an asshole...you need help.
I did think this was hilarious   " i had always been a bit of a rebel, 
listening to alternative music like new order, tears for fears, and depeche mode 
since 1980. "

Oddly enough, the only thing I'm amazed by is the ability to catalog

still being recalled and typed at a really fast rate.

Is anyone else reminded of the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from
the Future when they read Evie Stee?


Cybernetic Ghost: Thousands of years ago...
Frylock: No, shut up! You still haven't explained why the pool is
filled with elf blood!
Cybernetic Ghost: I told you earlier, it was the Great Circuiting.
Frylock: You didn't mention no Great Circuiting!
Cybernetic Ghost: Oh, I didn't? (Pause) Thousands of years ago

Gawd I'm sick of stevie and his racist / idiotic / anti-whatever comments. I
really shouldn't have to listen to his drivel. I just want a source of EDM
events along with some relevant discussion. Negative BS from him and a few
others isn't something that I need in my life. I'm unsubbing from the list,
but I'll still be around... someone please send me a ping if he ever gets
booted from the list.

Thanks,

Dan K

<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was bi-polar.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You need those drugs Stevie. Bi-Polar is like a common cold compared to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whats wrong with you.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You really ought to seek help on your own. Before someone else admits you or
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you get arrested.Like a doctor told me on my first trip to the psych unit<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;There is a fine line between genius and insanity.&quot; You are wasting so much<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time and energy on grandiose and paranoid delusions.

wow, junglealienXXX back on pb-cle-raves trying to convince kids they
are crazy to push drugs, so what is new?!

unfortunately, i am nothing like junglealienXXX and never had any
mental problems.  i've worked mostly fortune 500 company jobs
with government, military, and fortune 500 company accounts.

you are not the first poser doctor that tried to push drugs on me.
several dem lawyers pretending to be psychiatrist were just recently
busted in california for it.  they are now spending 7 years in a fed
pen.  it is against federal law to push drugs without being a board
certified doctor.  unfortunately, being a sneaky greedy dem lawyer
with fake degrees did not qualify.

i feel sorry for you junglealienXXX, all these years and you are still
pushing drugs and confessing to the world you were mental.  has
anyone noticed crazy people think everybody else in the world is
crazy too?  this would explain your twisted definition of mania.
by your definition, hulka-mania fans are all insane and need to
take the pills you are pushing to survive.  when in reality, i think
most hulk fans would rather throw you than have to take the pills
you are pushing.

ah, the glory days when the underground scene was about the
rapture, the heavenly music, the peace, the love, the unity, and
the respect before the obvious tares came in, hi-jacked pb-cle-raves
to push drugs.  sometimes i wonder if they actually believe the
crap they are spewing to justify their obvious drug pushing.

- the real steve t

(as opposed to aliens from the jungle claiming everybody is crazy
 to push drugs again)

hmmm, didn't troutpoop confess he was XXXjunglalienXXX before?
wouldn't surprise me.  it would explain alot, seeing as how he used
to spam me with his fecal porn fetish and copies of his hitler stamps.

</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">to&nbsp;be an artist&nbsp;for DC comics when george perez was drawing superman, </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">but i had to tell him i&nbsp;had made plans to go to college (case western reserve

</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">and para-sail in acapulco.&nbsp; and since i excelled at computers, i was invited </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">to take a summer class at rose hulman institute of technology in indiana.
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">secretly, it was also because i was the first kid to solve the rubic&#39;s cube in </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">my&nbsp;town and because of my high scores at missile command, i was being

<font face="arial narrow">http://bama.ua.edu/~zbt/famous_alumni_of_zbt.htm</font></a></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the cleveland chapter was the lambda chapter of CWRU, one of the oldest.</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">

i was in varsity track at CWRU,&nbsp;but i never lost my passion for underground</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">music, I used to go to all the alternative concerts and clubs and eventually</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">

became a WRUW 91.1&nbsp;FM college radio DJ.&nbsp; I also started the CWRU </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">billiard club, the CWRU rave team, and PLRM magazine while in college.</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">

I used to do bus trips to all these big raves in cleveland, pittsburgh, </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">toronto, baltimore, new york, philadelphia, indiana, chicago, columbus,</font></div> 
 <div><font face="arial narrow">kentucky, st. louis,&nbsp;etc. I was quite a super promotor back then </font><font face="arial narrow">promoting </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">for smart bar, columbus, major raves all over the midwest,&nbsp;
</font><font face="arial narrow">and&nbsp;ended up</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">putting&nbsp;together&nbsp;the big meeting of all the ohio promotors&nbsp;</font><font face="arial narrow">from which </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">

&#39;family affair&#39; came from.&nbsp;</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">i was infamous for partying, going to concerts, or clubbing every </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">weekend with my frat brothers: my little brother: jim raishart (another 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">german american, whose real last name was reichart, but changed it,</font></div>  <div><font face="arial
 narrow">because he thought it sounded too nazi...ironically, he&#39;s from cinci,</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">ohio and told me stories about the grand pooh bah of the KKK, who</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">

used to live in cinci, ohio) and lars fisher (straight out of germany,</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">except he wasn&#39;t little, he was 6&#39; 8&quot;)...i used to go to clubs with pam</font></div>  <div>
<font face="arial narrow">
the cool lens crafter chick, lady miss lisa, becky from chicago</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">northwestern, and the girl i dated in college: olga #1, this polish</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">

american girl, who was a lesbian when i first met her, but became</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">bi after me.&nbsp; she introduced me to universal unitarianism, what paul</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">

revere was when he ran through town yelling: &quot;the british are
 coming,</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the british are coming&quot; right before the revolutionary war (thus my </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">minuteman connection).</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>

  <div><font face="arial narrow">I briefly dropped out of CWRU for awhile to make some money from &#39;94</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">to &#39;97 at MBNA (a Fortune 500 company job one couldn&#39;t get unless you
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">passed a drug test and 2 interviews) within one month i became the best </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">rep there and was promoted to Mentor 218.&nbsp; I was selected to represent
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">cleveland for the all-star competition in dallas, which i tied for 4th with a</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">4.0 SPH.&nbsp; as a result i got to go to corporate in delaware and to attend
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">a NASCAR race in connecticut.&nbsp;&nbsp; ironically, i worked at MBNA when</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">louie freeh was the FBI director and was an exec at MBNA, he had even
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">used MBNA for some financial investigations.</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">I graduated&nbsp;from CWRU the summer&nbsp;of &#39;97 with a&nbsp;double degree in </font>

</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">architecture, art history, and a minor in theatre.&nbsp;but my final project</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">before i graduated was a 24 page term paper on simon vouet&#39;s
</font>
</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">mary magdalene painting at the cleveland museum of art.</font></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">I decided to move down to columbus, ohio to be closer to my girlfriend
 </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">of 2 years at&nbsp;the time: christa rector.&nbsp; we broke up around the same </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">time princess di passed away.&nbsp; she wanted to move to detroit and see 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">other people. i didn&#39;t.&nbsp; and then i met layla, another crazy german girl. </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">and layla really was crazy, she did all kinds of crazy drugs, many of 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">which i had never even heard of before.&nbsp; she got them, because she </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">was bi-polar.&nbsp; this didn&#39;t always mix well with me especially since at
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">the time i was a part of the pre Y2K intelligence team for the state of</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">ohio with accounts with wright patterson air force, city of columbus,
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">ohio state boards, and various fortune 500 companies (jobs you can&#39;t</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">get unless you passed a drug test, 2 interviews, and had government
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">connections)...she was alot of fun though.&nbsp; and within 3 months i had </font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">given her a ring.&nbsp; i don&#39;t think she took it very seriously, because within 
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">3 more months she was seeing other guys.&nbsp;i eventually took the ring</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">back when i caught her messing around on me for the third time.
</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">suffice it to say, she wasn&#39;t a very faithfull girl at the time.&nbsp; in fact,</font></div>  <div><font face="arial narrow">i think she participated in alot of illegal activities with gerrad martin,

idiots like you make it easy to spot the crazy crack heads!
when was wearing a tin foil hat ever in?  not now, not 10 years
ago, not with green eggs and ham!  god damn, me thinks i
do need to send some hulk-mania fans to toss these idiots!

um, who doesn't hate al quida jinx?...after all his gang got smart
bar busted due to his under-age drinking, metropolis busted due
to his cocaine trafficking, red zone busted due to his gang killing
someone, luckily the second time, the owner of the club hired
marines to toss the crazy crack heads out, unfortunately, they
took their revenge on the osu campus with 420 riots, when the
cops came, they fled to NY to join the NY bloods and bragged
the world trade center building would be the ultimate insurance
scam right before west coast black gang members showed the
WTC getting blown up on their gangster hip hop album featuring
the song "5 million ways to kill a CEO" right before 9/11!

you support al quida jinx, you support the dark tare terrorists that
killed 2,793 people in NY on 9/11!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} rose line of the mary magdalene...

Steve, can we get an explanation for what (a) "dark tare" (noun or
adjective/adverb??) is/means ?

Steve, there comes a time when you need to ask yourself, what is more
likely, that you have accomplished all of these things and are at the
center of many conspiracies, or that you are just another human being
like everyone else and may need a little help moderating these
thoughts/feelings .. . ?

 I personally recommended the FBI as part of the secret security force
during the Olympics in Greece and Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy,
so they are definitly being considered as part of the security force
during the coming Olympics in Beijing, China along with Interpol
in lieu of the bio-terrorism concerns raised by myself and gov. arnold
schwarzenegger.

the biggest threats to China in the past has been SARS and AIDS,
both traced to Africa.  and as with the World Cups in Germany,
women of the night shall be screened to keep STD's away from
atheletes.  also in lieu of the bad treatment of asian investors by
mexicans and democrats, Interpol and FBI and Homeland Security
shall be used to monitor mexicans and democrats who target
asian investors, mostly for identity theft scams.

previous Olympics some atheletes were disqualified due to
steroids and ephedrine used in cold medicine, so security shall
also keep an eye out for dark tares who seek to push illegal drugs
to atheletes in attempts to disqualify them.  these dark tares shall
be immediately ejected from the games and possibly the country
if caught.

Terrorism seen as biggest threat to Beijing
 (Adds Interpol quotes)
 BEIJING, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Terrorism is the biggest threat to next year'=
s
Beijing Olympics, a state newspaper cited top Chinese security officials as
saying on Tuesday, a concern echoed by the head of Interpol.
 The report did not say which groups might target the Games, but China is
home to several restive minorities such as the Muslim Uighurs in the far
western region of Xinjiang who have been blamed by Beijing for bomb attacks
in recent years.
 "Although the general security situation for the Beijing Olympics remains
stable, we still face the challenges of terrorism, separatism and
extremism," the official China Daily quoted Minister of Public Security Zho=
u
Yongkang as saying.
 "Terrorism, in particular, poses the biggest threat," he told a security
conference, the newspaper said.
 Ronald Noble, Secretary General of Interpol, told the Beijing conference
that the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and a purported new
videotape from Osama bin Laden underlined the "primary global criminal
threat" that the Games and all major global events must protect themselves
against.
 "According to published media reports, hundreds of thousands of athletes,
high-ranking government officials, celebrities, journalists and tourists
plan to make their way to Beijing next August to participate in, report on
and enjoy these Olympics," he told conference delegates, according to a
transcript of his speech at www.interpol.int.
 "Billions of people will watch the Games on television and follow the medi=
a
reports covering them. The combination of these elements makes such a major
global event a prime theoretical target for al Qaeda and other terrorist
groups."
 Regional and "ethnic" conflicts around the world could spill over at the
Games, "and some international terrorist or extremist groups might make use
of the event to launch attacks for their own purposes", added deputy
security minister Liu Jing.
 "The Olympic Games is a happy gathering for people from all countries, but
it's also a big target for terrorism," Liu said.
 The China Daily also said the vice-minister had noted that some
organisations and individuals had tried to politicise the Olympics and
intervene in China's internal affairs, and some others were planning to
disrupt the Olympic torch relay.
 The relay's route -- which has already sparked controversy with Taiwan
refusing to let the torch in -- should be guarded throughout its 130-day
journey, Liu said. China considers self-ruled Taiwan sovereign territory.
 China has previously lashed out at threats to boycott or disrupt the Games
on the pretext of protesting against human rights abuses or highlighting th=
e
plight of Tibet, saying it is purely a sporting event.
 Still, Liu said he was confident nothing would go wrong next year.
"Preparation for the security work is advancing smoothly," Liu said.

Tuesday, 11 September 2007
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has expanded the fight against th=
e
deadly West Nile virus by issuing an executive order that empowers local
agencies to fight the mosquito-borne virus. California is the worst affecte=
d
state in the US with 198 people contacting the West Nile virus infection.

Among them ten cases have proved fatal this year. Furthermore 722 birds hav=
e
tested positive for the virus in California this year. Around 673 positive
mosquito samples were found this year as opposed to the 575 in 2006.

Last month Governor Schwarzenegger issued executive orders to fund the figh=
t
against West Nile Virus by mosquito abatement, surveillance and vegetation
management.

"Protecting public safety is government's top job =96 that's why I'm commit=
ted
to ensuring our local agencies have all the tools they need to fight this
deadly mosquito-borne disease," the Governor said of his latest executive
order.

In August the Governor has declared a State of Emergency in the counties of
Kern, Colusa and San Joaquin and had allocated funds to prevent the spread
of the West Nile virus. In issuing the latest orders, he reminded
Californians to "protect themselves against mosquito bites =96 including
getting rid of standing water, wearing insect repellent and staying inside
during dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active."

According to the CDC, West Nile virus infection is established as a seasona=
l
epidemic in North America that flares up in the summer and continues into
the fall.  West Nile virus (WNV) is a potentially serious illness and this
year is predicted to be the worst season in the United States.

Although West Nile infection is mild in many cases, one in 150 people can
develop severe symptoms, which include high fever, headache, neck stiffness=
,
stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision
loss, numbness and paralysis.

Milder symptoms can include fever, headache, and body aches, nausea,
vomiting, and sometimes swollen lymph glands or a skin rash on the chest,
stomach and back. The worst of the symptoms arise when West Nile
virusinvades the neurological system.

According to the CDC, West Nile virus infection is established as a seasona=
l
epidemic in North America that flares up in the summer and continues into
the fall.  West Nile virus (WNV) is a potentially serious illness and this
year is predicted to be the worst season because of the increasing number o=
f
human cases reported thus far.

Preventing West Nile virus infection is the best way to cure it, according
to health experts. This is mainly because there is no cure for the disease.
Even Canada has not been spared this year as the Public Health Agency of
Canada has confirmed 234 human cases, 1,704 infected birds and 1,573
positive polls of West Nile Virus as of August 25, 2007.

West Nile encephalitis and West Nile meningitis are forms of severe disease
that affect a person's nervous system. Encephalitis refers to an
inflammation of the brain; meningitis is an inflammation of the membrane
around the brain and the spinal cord, the US Centers for Disease Control an=
d
Prevention says.

In 1999 the West Nile virus made its first appearance in the United States.
Seven people died in the New York region, while 55 others were sickened.

Last year there were a total of 4269 West Nile virus infections reported to
the CDC among which 177 proved lethal.  The worst affected state in terms o=
f
fatalities was Texas with 32 deaths in the 354 cases reported to the CDC.

Idaho followed the fatality charts with 21 deaths among the 956 West Nile
infections reported to the CDC.

In the United States human cases have been reported to the CDC from Alabama=
,
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia,
Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia,
and Wyoming.

Avian, animal or mosquito WNV infections have also been reported to CDC
ArboNET from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri,
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Overall 906 human cases of mosquito-borne West Nile virus infection have
been reported nationwide, according to the latest report from the U.S.
Geological Survey.

Consumers must be aware that the West Nile Virus season is almost over, but
that does not mean the threat of infection has decreased. Prevention is
always better than cure, so please follow the measures proposed by the CDC,

* When you are outdoors, use insect repellent containing an EPA-registered
active ingredient. Follow the directions on the package.

* Many mosquitoes are most active at dusk and dawn. Be sure to use insect
repellent and wear long sleeves and pants at these times or consider stayin=
g
indoors during these hours.

* Make sure you have good screens on your windows and doors to keep
mosquitoes out.

* Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower
pots, buckets and barrels. Change the water in pet dishes and replace the
water in bird baths weekly. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out.
Keep children's wading pools empty and on their sides when they aren't bein=
g
used.

the west coast homeland security report details how the dangerous mosquitos
were traced to U.C. Davis that was working on a west nile virus vaccine, bu=
t
a
batch of the dangerous mosquitos disappeared and re-appeared pre-dominantly
in the sacramento, california are.  U. C. Davis obtained their dangerous
mosquitos from the Proving Grounds, chemical and biological warfare center
in provo, utah (largely controlled by the mormons).  It was most likely a
revenge
attack for the California Recall election of former Gov. Grey Davis. number
one
on the suspect list was Taliban Favor Nathaniel R. Davis, who had previousl=
y
threatened the US government with chemical warfare right before the RICIN
attack on the US senate.  As a result the US senate laid a $5 million dolla=
r
federal bounty on taliban favor's head.  I recently reduced that federal
bounty to
$100,000 to re-allocate $4.9 million to the California west nile virus
victim's
medical bills.

unfortunately, this means the number one job of west coast homeland securit=
y
and west coast FBI is to investigate other democrats who may hate
republicans
and may be involved in bio-terrorism...

Terrorism seen as biggest threat to Beijing</div>
=09<div class=3D"newsml-body"><div> (Adds Interpol quotes)</div>
<div> BEIJING, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Terrorism is the biggest
threat to next year&#39;s Beijing Olympics, a state newspaper cited
top Chinese security officials as saying on Tuesday, a concern
echoed by the head of Interpol.</div>
<div> The report did not say which groups might target the Games,
but China is home to several restive minorities such as the
Muslim Uighurs in the far western region of Xinjiang who have
been blamed by Beijing for bomb attacks in recent years.</div>
<div> &quot;Although the general security situation for the Beijing
Olympics remains stable, we still face the challenges of
terrorism, separatism and extremism,&quot; the official China Daily
quoted Minister of Public Security Zhou Yongkang as saying.</div>
<div> &quot;Terrorism, in particular, poses the biggest threat,&quot; he
told a security conference, the newspaper said.</div>
<div> Ronald Noble, Secretary General of Interpol, told the
Beijing conference that the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11
attacks and a purported new videotape from Osama bin Laden
underlined the &quot;primary global criminal threat&quot; that the Games
and all major global events must protect themselves against.</div>
<div> &quot;According to published media reports, hundreds of
thousands of athletes, high-ranking government officials,
celebrities, journalists and tourists plan to make their way to
Beijing next August to participate in, report on and enjoy
these Olympics,&quot; he told conference delegates, according to a
transcript of his speech at <a href=3D"http://www.interpol.int">www.interpo=
l.int</a>.</div>
<div> &quot;Billions of people will watch the Games on television and
follow the media reports covering them. The combination of
these elements makes such a major global event a prime
theoretical target for al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.&quot;</div>
<div> Regional and &quot;ethnic&quot; conflicts around the world could
spill over at the Games, &quot;and some international terrorist or
extremist groups might make use of the event to launch attacks
for their own purposes&quot;, added deputy security minister Liu
Jing.</div>
<div> &quot;The Olympic Games is a happy gathering for people from all
countries, but it&#39;s also a big target for terrorism,&quot; Liu said.</d=
iv>
<div> The China Daily also said the vice-minister had noted that
some organisations and individuals had tried to politicise the
Olympics and intervene in China&#39;s internal affairs, and some
others were planning to disrupt the Olympic torch relay.</div>
<div> The relay&#39;s route -- which has already sparked controversy
with Taiwan refusing to let the torch in -- should be guarded
throughout its 130-day journey, Liu said. China considers
self-ruled Taiwan sovereign territory.</div>
<div> China has previously lashed out at threats to boycott or
disrupt the Games on the pretext of protesting against human
rights abuses or highlighting the plight of Tibet, saying it is
purely a sporting event.</div>
<div> Still, Liu said he was confident nothing would go wrong
next year. &quot;Preparation for the security work is advancing
smoothly,&quot; Liu said.<br>---<br><table class=3D"messageheader" border=

season is almost over, but that does not mean the threat of infection
has decreased. Prevention is always better than cure, so please follow
the measures proposed by the CDC,<br><br>* When you are outdoors, use
insect repellent containing an EPA-registered active ingredient. Follow
the directions on the package.<br><br>* Many mosquitoes are most active at =
dusk and dawn. Be sure to use insect repellent and wear long sleeves and pa=

 at these times or consider staying indoors during these hours.<br><br>* Ma=
ke sure you have good screens on your windows and doors to keep mosquitoes =
out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>*
Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from
flower pots, buckets and barrels. Change the water in pet dishes and
replace the water in bird baths weekly. Drill holes in tire swings so
water drains out. Keep children&#39;s wading pools empty and on their sides

Stevie may or may not need help, but that reason has nothing to do with

'tares' is from the Holy Bible...

from KJV of Holy Bible from the Book of Matthew 13...

24 Another parable <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd284.htm#003> put
he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
heaven<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd170.htm#006>is likened
unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed
tares<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000>among the
wheat <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd381.htm#000>, and went his
way.

26 But when the blade
<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd060.htm#003>was sprung up, and
brought forth
fruit <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd139.htm#000>, then appeared
the tares <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000> also.

27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not
thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it
tares<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000>
?

28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him,
Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the
tares<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000>,
ye root up also the
wheat<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd381.htm#000>with them.

30 Let both grow together until the
harvest<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd165.htm#008>:
and in the time of
harvest<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd165.htm#008>I will say
to the reapers, Gather ye together first the
tares <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000>, and bind them in
bundles to burn them: but gather the
wheat<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd381.htm#000>into my
barn <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd045.htm#004>.

31 Another parable <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd284.htm#003> put
he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
heaven<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd170.htm#006>is like to a
grain <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd154.htm#003> of
mustard<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd262.htm#009>seed, which
a man took, and sowed in his field:

32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the
greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come
and lodge <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd231.htm#002> in the
branches thereof.

33 Another parable
<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd284.htm#003>spake he unto
them; The kingdom of
heaven <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd170.htm#006> is like unto
leaven <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd226.htm#000>, which a woman
took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

34 All these things spake
Jesus<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd205.htm#006>unto the
multitude in parables; and without a
parable <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd284.htm#003> spake he not
unto them:

35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
prophet<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd300.htm#008>,
saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have
been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

36 Then Jesus <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd205.htm#006> sent the
multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him,
saying, Declare unto us the
parable<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd284.htm#003>of the
tares <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000> of the field.

37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son
of man;

38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom;
but the tares <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000> are the
children of the wicked one;

39 The enemy that sowed them is the
devil<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd102.htm#007>;
the harvest <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd165.htm#008> is the end
of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

40 As therefore the
tares<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000>are gathered
and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this
world.

41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of
his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;

42 And shall cast them into a
furnace<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd140.htm#000>of fire:
there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the
sun<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd353.htm#001>in the kingdom
of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

44 Again, the kingdom of
heaven<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd170.htm#006>is like unto
treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he
hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth
that field.

45 Again, the kingdom of
heaven<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd170.htm#006>is like unto
a
merchant <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd249.htm#003> man, seeking
goodly pearls:

46 Who, when he had found one
pearl<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd287.htm#007>of great
price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.

47 Again, the kingdom of
heaven<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd170.htm#006>is like unto
a
net <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd271.htm#002>, that was cast into
the sea, and gathered of every kind:

48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered
the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and
sever the wicked from among the just,

50 And shall cast them into the
furnace<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd140.htm#000>of fire:
there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

51 Jesus <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd205.htm#006> saith unto
them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto
the kingdom of heaven
<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd170.htm#006>is like unto a man
that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his
treasure things new and old.

53 And it came to pass, that when
Jesus<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd205.htm#006>had finished
these parables, he departed thence.

54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their
synagogue <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd354.htm#009>, insomuch
that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and
these mighty works?

55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called
Mary<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd242.htm#009>?
and his brethren, James <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd196.htm#007>,
and Joses, and Simon <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd344.htm#004>,
and Judas <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd213.htm#001>?

56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all
these things?

57 And they were offended in him. But
Jesus<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd205.htm#006>said unto
them, A
prophet <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd300.htm#008> is not without
honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
 58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

</p>
<p><a name="025">25</a>&nbsp;But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000">tares</a> among the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>

</p>
<p><a name="026">26</a>&nbsp;But when the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd060.htm#003">blade</a> was sprung up, and brought forth <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, then appeared the

</p>
<p><a name="027">27</a>&nbsp;So the servants of the householder came and

 I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd359.htm#000">tares</a>, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd381.htm#000">

</p>
<p><a name="041">41</a>&nbsp;The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and

<p><a name="044">44</a>&nbsp;Again, the kingdom of <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>

</p>
<p><a name="047">47</a>&nbsp;Again, the kingdom of <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is like unto a <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a>, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} rose line of the mary magdalene...

Adam, Adam, Adam... if you could only see why it's not so simple.

You see, it's not ALL Stevie behind his solutions. He is a direct  
descendant of the Kings and Queens of the Celestial Kingdom -- he is  
a true son of heaven. Thousands and thousands of years ago his  
ancestors made great prophecies of his coming.

Thousands and thousands of years before that, they built a great wall  
to keep out the moon people and to channel the chi of the collective  
people into a giant exercise machine. The machine would transform the  
user into a superman, making him so studly that no women would have  
sex with any other men, effectively decimating the populations of  
humanity. The prophet who bears the responsibility for correcting the  
world's overpopulation crisis must first gain the trust of the people  
of which he shall rule, namely by throwing some parties and informing  
the influential people on THIS LIST of his intellectual dominance.

Unfortunately, there were also prophecies made those thousands and  
thousands of years ago of anti-prophets that would come in the form  
of inanimate objects. These inanimate objects, when placed in the  
proper alignment can erase the powers of the prophet -- BUT THIS WILL  
SIGNAL THE END OF THE WORLD. The knights of the golden chamberpots  
have been entrusted with this information for generations upon  
generations, of which a direct descendant is none other than our own  
Jea Leigh. She holds onto the secret weapon knowing the two paths our  
future can take, torn between which fate she shall let pass.

This is too much writing for a joke ending with her panties.

Jea's panties, Badger Milk, Fluffy Penis, World Solutions, and Vinyl  
vs. Digital. Amen.

close, but no cigar (i think arnold confiscated all the cuban cigars,
since he's the big cigar afficianado).

i am related to one of the earliest emperors of china, when they
were known as son of heaven chosen messengers of God.  i am a
direct descendant of shem, who traveled to the mount of the east
(the himalayas) after being recieving the holy blessing from noah,

the prophecies are jewish and christian prophecies from the holy
bible. so the emperor was like a pope when china had emperors,
the emperors were basically the word of God.  completely by the
book of traditions for thousands and thousands of years.

then the CIA trained mao tse dong in the yale in china program
to hate everything that is rich and that he should over throw the
ruling class to convert china into a huge sweatshop factory for
america.  so he started up communism to give china industrial
strength and to manufacture enough weapons of war to over
throw the ruling class.

unfortunately, when you cast out the smart people, like doctors,
professors, scientists, etc. things get really stupid really fast. china
became a mindless, soul-less nation of workaholics.

i have fufilled many prophecies including being the lord of hosts
(i have promoted for over 1000 events from ohio to NY to Vegas to
Cali since 1984), the least in the kingdom of heaven that shall be
greater than john, the stone that had been rejected that has become
the chief cornerstone, the greater than solomon that is here, one in
the body of christ, etc.

revelation is prophecies concerning the end times, but i do not
believe it is even close to the end of the world, not by a long
shot.  humanity should be intelligent to see that the dark tares
way of war profiteering is very destructive and senseless to come
to a consensus to stop more and more unnecessary foreign wars
due to obviously bogus intell like the forged document from niger.
africa that tricked america into the war on iraq.

there is a possibility that jea leigh may be of the rose line since
she is french, but it depends if she is pure french and if she is a
french royal line.  but i think the royal brits burned alot of the
french royal blood when joan of arc was burned at the stake.
so i guess in british eyes, the french were seen as tares back
then.  and during hitler times the jews are seen as tares during
WWII.  nowadays, the dems see arabs as tares.  but most people
who did real investigation work know that the arabs were not
behind 9/11, they were framed.  it was an old nazi plan that
had been executed by african immigrants.  zacharias moussaui
came from morocco, north africa. just as yussef ramsey, the 1993
wtc bomber came from egypt, north africa.

but really, i'm not for burning any people.  but the black horse
of injustice, must concede it had done terribly wrong and
compensate its victims or things will get worse for them. God
is very specific about cursing those who rob his people in the
book of malachi.

there is a prophecy that the last adam shall be a quickening
spirit.

ironically, i never took jea's panties.  i don't think she wears any.
but i did used to have this techno track: 'madonna's little panties'
but i think i gave it to tim madonna in columbus, who was with
ele mental for awhile.

i accidentally took lady ivy's panties once (it got stuck in my pants
when her dad called and said he was coming over)...and she
really is a french princess.  when i returned them, lightning struck
fulfilling the prophecy: as lightening shineth forth from the east to
the west, so shall the coming of the son of man be.  so she knows
i am real.  plus that 'coyote ugly' movie i showed her has
blossomed to a real coyote ugly in new york new york hotel
and casino in vegas.  the movies can come true on the west
coast.  it has all been a huge test of faith. but not everyone
is meant to be pulled out of 'the matrix'  ;)

the knights templar have nothing to do with knights of gold
chamberpots, but that's another story entirely.

Yep, an auto-delete button... Setup a filter:

If message sender's name is "rapture t" (or I guess use the email address)
move to deleted messages

across one by someone you thought was a little off? Maybe like this one:

If you ever find one that makes you go "Man, that guy is crazy!" let us
know 'cause it has *got* to be worth checking out.

wow, XXXjunglealienXXX back on pb-cle-raves trying to convince kids
they are crazy to push drugs, so what is new?!

unfortunately, i am nothing like XXXjunglealienXXX and never had
any mental problems.  i've worked mostly fortune 500 company jobs
with government, military, and fortune 500 company accounts.

you are not the first poser doctor that tried to push drugs on me.
several dem lawyers pretending to be psychiatrist were just recently
busted in california for it.  they are now spending 7 years in a fed
pen.  it is against federal law to push drugs without being a board
certified doctor.  unfortunately, being a sneaky greedy dem lawyer
with fake degrees did not qualify.

i feel sorry for you XXXjunglealienXXX, all these years and you
are still  pushing drugs and confessing to the world you were mental.
has anyone noticed crazy people think everybody else in the world is
crazy too?  this would explain your twisted definition of mania.
by your definition, hulka-mania fans are all insane and need to
take the pills you are pushing to survive.  when in reality, i think
most hulk fans would rather throw you than have to take the pills
you are pushing.

ah, the glory days when the underground scene was about the
rapture, the heavenly music, the peace, the love, the unity, and
the respect before the obvious tares came in, hi-jacked pb-cle-raves
to push drugs.  sometimes i wonder if they actually believe the
crap they are spewing to justify their obvious drug pushing.

- the real steve t

(as opposed to aliens from the jungle claiming everybody is crazy
 to push drugs again)

hmmm, didn't troutpoop confess he was XXXjunglalienXXX before?
wouldn't surprise me.  it would explain alot, seeing as how he used
to spam me with his fecal porn fetish and copies of his hitler stamps.

time was the most lucrative contractor in the country,a fortune 500 company.I'm 
proud to say I haven't used drugs in over 3 years which is a magor 
accomplishment for me.The very nature of your disease won't allow you to see that you 
need help.You'll either die that way or someone else will admit you and maybe 
you will stay on the meds long enough to realize just how ridiculous your 
thoughts are.It took me years.Don't you have any familly that is concerned about 
you?I still have my moments when i think the meds are all bullshit just to sedate 
me,so "Big Brother" can silence a voice of dissent.Fortunatley I have people 
around me now to let me know when I am getting out of control.I'm failry 
stable enough now not to be a recluse and able to sustain relationships.The meds do 
have shitty side effects and it takes awhile to find the right ones that 
work.Overall my quality of life is much better.

how ironic,a tomahawk missile was shot into a billion dollar pharmaceutical
company in khourtum / sudan africa during the clinton administration, after
it was discovered that some of the pills being manufactured there killed 1/3

of people it was given to.  in other words, africa used pharmaceutical
companies that were fronts for chemical warfare on america.  it is at these
pharmaceutical companies where current bio-warfare problems in america
were experimented upon: AIDS, anthrax, e. boli. e.coli, west nile virus,
avian bird flu, and malaria.  the companies were orginally started by nazi's
like troutpoop.  many africans and jews were killed during WWII with nazi
experiments. rumsfeld of the D.O.D. had to create his own intelligence
agency after he suspected nazi's may have been involved in the attack
on the pentagon on 9/11.  i had been scouted by the D.O.D. for NORAD
during the reagan administration. my parents are reagan era republicans.
you god damn idiots had been trying to frame the source of your pay check
money.

well, the fortune 500 company i worked at was MBNA, which was used as a
front
for the FBI for financial investigations since Louie Freeh was an exec there
and
is a former FBI Director.  that job, like almost every job I had, one had to
pass a
drug test and 2 interviews before you can even get the job.  the last job in
ohio
i had was a federal government employment agency job where i got people
jobs in the US government, US military, fortune 500 company, and healthcare
organizations.  another job one could only get by passing a drug test and
two
interviews.  it is now known as the office of personel management, the US
federal government's human resource center.

how desperately you try to broadsweep the scene as a bunch of idiots that
need
your drugs, when i was one of the ones who started the scene in ohio in 1984

and drugs had nothing to do with it.  it was all about the music and the
people.
you are sounding more and more like nazi troutpoop making up ridiculous
crap to push drugs again!

i was never alone.  i speak to at last count 10 million people on-line at a
time.
obviously, since i was a part of the pre Y2K intelligence team for the state
of
ohio, I helped network the networks.  in addition, i was a fraternity
brother at ZBT,
where alot of the alumni are the owners of all the major media corps.  and i
am
currently the international intelligence director, so i also network
internationally
concerning security concerns since as i said i recruited air force, army,
navy, and
marines before in ohio. this is why i just posted some of the agencies
involved
in security for the coming olympics in china, and you idiots are the living
profile
of everything china wants to keep out.  especially nazi troutpoop and his
"killer"
pills  and ed rodgers pushing opium when china regards opium as jews regard
swastikas ever since the emperor hacked heads to get opium out of china
before.
china just stopped executing illegal drug dealers less than 20 years ago.

wow, ed rodgers pushing opium on the list, another confession.

next time you step out, ed rodgers, you might as well wave 'hi'
to the cameras in the sky.  here is a clue it's the same satellites
that were used to make some crop circles before.

are you a total moron, i just posted how the next olympics is
coming up in china and multiple intelligence agencies are
involved in international security for the olympics and you
brag about pushing opium in china (when china regards
opium as jews regard swastikas ever since the emperor
hacked heads to get opium out of china befoie. china
just stopped executing illegal drug dealers less than 20
years ago).

this is almost as dumb as that poor mexican boy that got
nabbed trying to steal my bike when i specifically warned
him he was being watched.

<br><br>i am related to one of the earliest emperors of china, when they<br>were known as son of heaven chosen messengers of God.&nbsp; i am a <br>direct descendant of shem, who traveled to the mount of the east<br>(the himalayas) after being recieving the holy blessing from noah,
<br><br>the prophecies are jewish and christian prophecies from the holy <br>bible. so the emperor was like a pope when china had emperors, <br>the emperors were basically the word of God.&nbsp; completely by the<br>book of traditions for thousands and thousands of years.
<br><br>then the CIA trained mao tse dong in the yale in china program<br>to hate everything that is rich and that he should over throw the <br>ruling class to convert china into a huge sweatshop factory for<br>america.&nbsp; so he started up communism to give china industrial
<br>strength and to manufacture enough weapons of war to over<br>throw the ruling class.<br><br>unfortunately, when you cast out the smart people, like doctors,<br>professors, scientists, etc. things get really stupid really fast. china
<br>became a mindless, soul-less nation of workaholics.<br><br>i have fufilled many prophecies including being the lord of hosts <br>(i have promoted for over 1000 events from ohio to NY to Vegas to<br>Cali since 1984), the least in the kingdom of heaven that shall be 
<br>greater than john, the stone that had been rejected that has become <br>the chief cornerstone, the greater than solomon that is here, one in <br>the body of christ, etc.<br><br>revelation is prophecies concerning the end times, but i do not
<br>believe it is even close to the end of the world, not by a long<br>shot.&nbsp; humanity should be intelligent to see that the dark tares <br>way of war profiteering is very destructive and senseless to come<br>to a consensus to stop more and more unnecessary foreign wars
<br>due to obviously bogus intell like the forged document from niger.<br>africa that tricked america into the war on iraq. <br><br>there is a possibility that jea leigh may be of the rose line since<br>she is french, but it depends if she is pure french and if she is a
<br>french royal line.&nbsp; but i think the royal brits burned alot of the<br>french royal blood when joan of arc was burned at the stake. <br>so i guess in british eyes, the french were seen as tares back<br>then.&nbsp; and during hitler times the jews are seen as tares during
<br>WWII.&nbsp; nowadays, the dems see arabs as tares.&nbsp; but most people<br>who did real investigation work know that the arabs were not <br>behind 9/11, they were framed.&nbsp; it was an old nazi plan that<br>had been executed by african immigrants.&nbsp; zacharias moussaui
<br>came from morocco, north africa. just as yussef ramsey, the 1993<br>wtc bomber came from egypt, north africa. <br><br>but really, i&#39;m not for burning any people.&nbsp; but the black horse<br>of injustice, must concede it had done terribly wrong and
<br>compensate its victims or things will get worse for them. God<br>is very specific about cursing those who rob his people in the <br>book of malachi.<br><br>there is a prophecy that the last adam shall be a quickening
<br>
spirit.<br><br>ironically, i never took jea&#39;s panties.&nbsp; i don&#39;t think she wears any.<br>but i did used to have this techno track: &#39;madonna&#39;s little panties&#39; <br>but i think i gave it to tim madonna in columbus, who was with
<br>ele mental for awhile.<br><br>i accidentally took lady ivy&#39;s panties once (it got stuck in my pants<br>when her dad called and said he was coming over)...and she <br>really is a french princess.&nbsp; when i returned them, lightning struck 
<br>fulfilling the prophecy: as lightening shineth forth from the east to <br>the west, so shall the coming of the son of man be.&nbsp; so she knows<br>i am real.&nbsp; plus that &#39;coyote ugly&#39; movie i showed her has <br>blossomed to a real coyote ugly in new york new york hotel
<br>and casino in vegas.&nbsp; the movies can come true on the west<br>coast.&nbsp; it has all been a huge test of faith. but not everyone<br>is meant to be pulled out of &#39;the matrix&#39;&nbsp; ;) <br><br>the knights templar have nothing to do with knights of gold

First let me state I no longer use drugs and I never sold drugs.
 
"one had to pass a drug test and 2 interviews before you can even get the 
job."
 
 
The fortune 500 company I worked for I had no interview I had to pass.I was 
told when I had to take a piss test and given time to get clean.After that I 
used drugs with upper level management.
 
 
"how desperately you try to broadsweep the scene as a bunch of idiots that 
need 
your drugs, when i was one of the ones who started the scene in ohio in 1984 
and drugs had nothing to do with it. "
 
Goto hyperreal.org and notice the section called chemistry with the "e" next 
to it.Place your cursor over the word chemistry and notice the word drugs pops 
up.If you didn't experience a pre millenial rave enhanced with ecstasy then 
you really have no idea what it was really about....

In 1984 you were 14 years old.I could be wrong but I don't think acid house 
was even invented yet.What was it a disco scene?And I know you are the self 
proclaimed ultimate "promoter" that ever lived.By promoter do you mean the entity 
that fronts the money,resources and organizes the event? Or the guy that 
hands out flyers so he can get in the party for free?

i know brian behlendorf, was there when he married laura w/ sho and the
 whole cru in indiana.  i'm one of the guys who wrote the history section
for ohio on mw-raves@hyperreal.org.  so, suffice it to say, yes, i am well
aware of that section. in fact, that section may have my original quotes
about how the scene is not about "e" and my whole dia-tribe about
frankie bone's peace and love speech to stop a gang fight at one of his
storm raves and my whole take on the peace, love, unity, and respect
movement from woodstock, even before woodstock giving credit to
japanese companies: sony, technics, roland, etc. all being critical to the
creation of the music that is the actual driving force of the scene.

i've tried "e" before when there were moons and doves and adams.
it's really not a big deal to me at all.  i can really care less about it
actually.

yes, 14 was when i first started making mix tapes of mostly alternative
music (mostly from when they first started) and distributing it to a bunch
of my classmates.  i made funky colage covers and mixed and edited
the tapes myself.  and then MTV did their 120 Minutes show, probably
one of the best shows on TV at the time if you had cable.

but like i said, i give credit to companies like: Sony, Yamaha, Technic,
Roland, etc. as well, some of which started in the 1800's as being
critically important to the evolution of the scene as we know it today.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Sep 21                  NU-MARK AND ROC RAIDA                  Columbus

DJ Nu-Mark
Hip Hop // Soul (Breaks) // Brazilian (Samba) // Jurassic 5 // Blend 
Crafters . Los Angeles
www.myspace.com/djnumark

For well over ten years, DJ Nu-Mark has been among Hip-Hop.s most 
respected DJs and producers. Recognized for his membership in the gold 
selling group Jurassic 5, Nu-Mark is best known for his production on 
the raw anthem .What.s Golden. and the smooth and soulful .Work It Out,. 
featuring Dave Matthews. Additionally, his innovative DJ routines and 
creative on-stage antics have made him a favorite of crowds all over the 
world.

Perhaps best known for their thrilling stage show, Jurassic 5 has toured 
the globe several times over, and have made numerous television 
appearances. With Jurassic 5, Nu-Mark has performed at many of the 
world.s most important and exciting music festivals . Coachella, 
Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza 2003, Australia.s Big Day Out, The UK.s Reading 
Festival, and Japan.s Summer Sonic . where his mastery of a complex, 
six-piece DJ rig and his playful incorporation of children.s musical 
toys have amazed and delighted crowds of up to 50,000 fans. Jurassic 5 
has appeared alongside many of music.s greats, including A Tribe Called 
Quest, the Wu-Tang Clan, Outkast, The Roots, Run DMC, Green Day, and 
even Bruce Springsteen.

Nu-Mark is responsible for half of the production of Jurassic 5.s entire 
body of work: Jurassic 5 EP (1997), Quality Control (2000), Power In 
Numbers (2002), and Feedback (2006). He has also released his own 
projects, independent of the group: Blend Crafters, an instrumental 
album created in the spirit of allowing beats to speak for themselves, 
and Hands On, a mix-CD. Hands On assembles a diverse and eclectic set of 
sounds, everything from soulful breaks to comedic skits, as well as 
classic underground jams, and includes a special section devoted to 
hip-hop from around the world. By turns hilarious and impressive, this 
project displays both Nu-Mark.s eccentric sense of humor and his 
devotion to solid, simply dope music. Currently, Nu-Mark is placing his 
beats on a number of projects in a variety of genres.

Nu-Mark began DJing as a teenager in Los Angeles. Over the course of the 
last two decades, he has amassed a collection of over 35,000 records and 
refined his technical skills and performance style to the point where he 
is widely recognized as one of the key figures in the late-90s DJ 
explosion which pushed the DJ to the front of the culture.s awareness. 
As a result of this distinction, Nu-Mark has been featured in a 
diversity of publications and in several films: the critically acclaimed 
documentary .Scratch,. .KeepinTime. (which features impromptu 
collaborations with Mad Lib, Cut-Chemist, Babu, J-Rocc, and drummers 
James Gatson and Paul Humphrey), .Coachella: The Movie,. and .Rock the 
Bells . The Documentary..

Today, Nu-Mark is well-known for his innovative plays on sound . 
attaching a rubber band to his turntable.s needle and playing it like an 
upright bass or tapping on the turntable.s dust cover to simulate a bass 
drum. Incorporating a wide range of musical styles . soul, funk, 
hip-hop, and samba effortlessly blended together . Nu-Mark revels in 
surprising an audience with a forgotten gem, an unknown banger, or a 
fresh take on a well-known hit. From Sao Paolo to Sydney, from Toronto 
to Tokyo, Nu-Mark.s carefully crafted, explosively energetic DJ sets 
never fail to get a party rocking.

ROC RAIDA
HIP HOP // TURNTABLIST // X-ECUTIONERS  NY

Roc Raida began his DJ career in the early eighties at the age of ten. 
Surrounded by such inspirations as his father, a member of the Sugar 
Hill Records act Mean Machine and hip hop impresario Grandmaster Flash, 
Raida cultivated his interest into an absolute passion. Now, Roc Raida 
is considered among the best of the contemporary DJ.s and has brought 
the underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.
In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who, for obvious of copyright reasons, later 
became known as the X-ecutioners. Champions of furthering the 
turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made their reputation by 
utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the manual alteration between 
individual kick and snare sounds to create original drum patterns in 
real time. This practice has been an inspiration and a force in Roc 
Raida.s style.
In the beginning defeat was commonplace, as battles were mainly 
popularity contests. The more contests he entered the more the 
competition began to appreciate his style and determination. Pushing his 
limits and raising the standard with which DMC.s are judged, Raida began 
to get noticed. His impressive finishes in some of the premier DJ 
battles; first place in the 1991 "As One"; second place in the "Superman 
Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC US Finals were just the 
beginning. In 1995 Raida, was crowned the DMC World Champion in front of 
a massive London audience.
The past several years have seen Raida traveling around the globe 
promoting the art of Turntablism in such exotic locations as Singapore, 
Turkey, Japan and Australia. Last year on a panel at the Rock-n-Roll 
Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of 
Hip-Hop.s founding fathers. Rules for this dubious honor state that one 
may only be bestowed with the approval of another Grandmaster, Raida was 
not only approved, but welcomed by Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore and 
scratch evolutionist DST. To round out a phenomenal decade, Raida was 
inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the 1999 DMC World Finals in New 
York City.
Roc Raida was recently featured on an episode of "Saturday Night Live"; 
the first DJ to ever share the stage with the fabled SNL band. Proving, 
once again, that Raida is the perfect example of a master perfecting his 
art.
Turntablism has come up through the rave culture and is now showcased at 
every Electronic Music happening with crews such as The X-Ecutioners, 
Invisbl Skratch Piklz, Allies and Beat Junkies headlining events 
worldwide. Now with the success of the X-Ecutioners record .Built from 
Scratch. and .Revolutions. Raida has taken a step forward to work on his 
first solo effort .Raida.s Talent Search. which will be a CD and DVD 
combined showing Raida.s production and turntablists efforts as well as 
his comedy sketches throughout the DVD. Raida is also currently working 
on his autobiography of his life. Look out! As it is time for 
Grandmaster Roc Raida to take the world by storm once again.

Thu Sep 27                         KASKADE                         Columbus

www.kaskademusic.com
View e-flyer and sample CD at: www.ultrarecords.com/ECards/Kaskade
Bring the Night is the latest mix album by house DJ/producer Kaskade. 
Released on Ultra Records, Bring the Night is crafted to give unwavering 
house heads what they want most in a mix album: it delivers on the party 
front and drops the big room jams. And true to Kaskade styleand what 
differentiates this artist from others in dance musicBring the Night 
also manages to serve up those trademark melodies and sensual vocals.
But more than anything, this is 115 minutes of feel good body rock. 
"With my artist albums, I'm conveying emotion, I'm constructing beats 
and writing songs that represent me as an artist and a person, so it 
doesn't necessarily come out as 'dance heavy,'" says Kaskade. "But a mix 
CD is about walking the line, and fitting my style in with the DJ side 
of things. Yeah, I want to keep it musical and fresh, but Bring the 
Night is intentionally produced very rhythmic andwell, banging. This is 
a head bobbing mix, something to pop in your car and thump."
And with 15 hard-hitting tracks, including Dance Chart topping Kaskade 
remixes of Nelly Furtado's "All Good Things (Come To An End)", and 
Floetry's "SupaStar," Bring the Night achieves just thatit's a non-stop, 
seamless stream of orchestrated beats and flavor, all with a nod to the 
night life.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Next step is having my name legally changed back to my maiden name. Wonder if I can do that without paying for the whole divorce first?

I no longer have a cell phone so I lost all my numbers. If I'm a friend of yours, and your number was likely in my phone, would you hit me back with your digits?

Why in the hell would you or anybody else that got arrested want everyone on a list to know this shit! You ever think that maybe the others sitting in jail don't want their business blabbed to everyone? Shit since your going to have someone post it to everyone anyway...Are you proud of getting busted at a meth lab in a house that was owned by you? Next time your hubby calls collect let him know that if he ever gets out there will be no visitation unless supervised(not like he'll care anyway).

Todd's going to post something on here kinda filling you all in on what's been going on with me, Trout, and a couple other people. 

Please, don't email me questions about anything. Email Todd.

Thanks,

Amanda

LOL. I'm out on signature bond because I have a clean record. So is another one of my co-defendants. None of us said a word to any cops. Since all five of us are innocent, I would have nothing to say anyhow. I will not discuss this case with anyone, either.

Thanks,

Amanda

Hello,

By forwarding this apology to the list I assume that you're unsure of what
to do and are seeking assistance from other list members.  I'd be happy to
assist you.  The correct response when someone apologizes to you is to
forgive them.  If you are in need of any other assistance please consult
the religious organization or moral authority of your choice.  They will
be able to help you in determine the proper way to conduct yourself.

All the best,
B.j.

 I wasn't going to let it get to me anyway. I don't stoop that low or let the ones who do get to me! Besides we are all brilliant in our own ways. I do appreciate the apology.  I wasn't trying to start shit. I just don't understand why this is something that you would want everyone to know. Maybe it is just easier to respond to everyone all at once by putting it on the list. I personally wouldn't want some strangers to know(not everybody is your friend on this list). The person that you love("Mark") is in jail and has no contact with you. If my sig. other was in jail, I wouldn't want to tell others his business. Besides all of the males in the article do not go by those names. By doing so it seems like something your proud of. Do you see where I am coming from? I guess I feel that if there are friends that should know then you would respond on a more personal level.  If anything I would call myself the smart mama for leaving his ass when I was pregnant! It blows my  mind
 how anyone can be with someone with a past like his. To have two kids from two different women and not be able to make either relationship work for the sake of the child is a little fucked up. You can't deny he has a fucked up present and a future that doesn't look too bright!  I hooked up with him about 10 years ago. I was young, dumb, & naive. What is your excuse? You can see why I'm not going to call you dumb for renting rooms to certain others. Feel free to comment on my shitty grammar. Peace Out, Cathy

I don't stoop that low or let the ones who do get to me! Besides we are all brilliant in our own ways. I do appreciate the apology.&nbsp; I wasn't trying to start shit. I just don't understand why this is something that you would want everyone to know. Maybe it is just easier to respond to everyone all at once by putting it on the list. I personally wouldn't want some strangers to know(not everybody is your friend on this list). The person that you love("Mark") is in jail and has no contact with you. If my sig. other was in jail, I wouldn't want to tell others
 his business. Besides all of the males in the article do not go by those names. By doing so it seems like something your proud of. Do you see where I am coming from? I guess I feel that if there are friends that should know then you would respond on a more personal level.&nbsp; If anything I would call myself the smart mama for leaving his ass when I was pregnant! It blows my  mind how anyone can be with someone with a past like his. To have two kids from two different women and not be able to make either relationship work for the sake of the child is a little fucked up. You can't deny he has a fucked up present and a future that doesn't look too bright!&nbsp; I hooked up with him about 10 years ago. I was young, dumb, &amp; naive. What is your excuse? You can see why I'm not going to call you dumb for renting rooms to certain others. Feel free to comment on my shitty grammar. Peace Out, Cathy<br><br><b><i>Amanda von Schtupp &lt;a_yesko@yahoo.com&gt;</i></b>

That is true. I made a comment about it because she said she was having someone else put a post about it(she is unable to speak about it).  Peace, Cathy

Thanks for your moral consultation. I figured since her comment about me being the dumb baby mama was posted on here, why not post her apology too. I responded to her before yah sent this, but my yahoo e-mail is giving me trouble about sending messages. I guess I got sucked in to the pb-cle-drama for once(it's a touchy subject)! Thanks for your reply. It was quite hilarious and made me laugh. I feel a lot better about the situation.  Peace, Cathy

By forwarding this apology to the list I assume that you're unsure of what
to do and are seeking assistance from other list members.  I'd be happy to
assist you.  The correct response when someone apologizes to you is to
forgive them.  If you are in need of any other assistance please consult
the religious organization or moral authority of your choice.  They will
be able to help you in determine the proper way to conduct yourself.

All the best,

Yes, I realized things already exploded on this list, but I'm posting
this anyway.  As one of Trout's closest friends, I feel like he would
want people to know something instead of just being left in the dark.

(begin was I was originally going to send)

As you may or may not be aware, earlier this week Trout's place got
raided. All his servers (including his email server) and cell phones
were confiscated. So if you send him email, call him, message him
through myspace and receive no answer, this is why.

This week has been hard on everyone close to trout. Although this news
isn't really all the private, being one of his closer friends for a
while now I felt it important to at least acknowledge the current
situation and status and to let people know. I ask that your thoughts
go out to Trout that everything works out.

As you can imagine, right now the ROM is running on auto-pilot. If you
have any announcements on parties, last minute changes, etc, just post
them to this list as any corrections and updates you send to trout via
email are not going to be responded to. Also I'd like to ask that this
not become a long drawn out thread on the list about what may or may not
happen and such.  We are all adults here and should act like such.

(end what I was I going to originally send)

Apparently I was wrong on everyone acting like adults.  *I* was the one
who originally felt it was important to let the list know.  I have
already been receiving inquires from people asking about his status and
have so far just ignored them.  This all I will mention about it for the
time being as it gets the information across that people would need to
know.  I apologize as I, nor do I ask anyone else that has been closely
envolved will give any more specifics.  There's already enough people
losing sleep at night over this.

If you feel that letting this list know that it's adminstrator and
friend of many is currently unavailable to handle any tasks (like the
freakin evie stee stuff of earlier) then take it out on me, then take it
out me.  Fuck, I'll give you my address and you can beat the fucking
shit of me if that makes you feel better.  This list really disgusts me
at times.  Fuck... Just look at the discussion over the past few
hours... Yes, emotions are running wild but we need to get a grip people.

i just posted a history update for love fest 2007 in SF, CA
on my site, you can check it at on my blog section at:
http://myspace.com/rapture3169

if you are interested in coming, e-mail me at:
tvt3169@yahoo.com i can hook you up with travel deals
since i had feng shui'ed alot of former US air force into
the travel industry.

as a former government and military recruiter and as the
international intelligence director, i had feng shui'ed alot
of former air force into the travel industry (one of my
accounts during Y2K was wright patterson air force, the
first air force base in america named after the wright
brothers in dayton, ohio, the air force base where the
famous hanger 18 is at with the UFO's from roswell that
the film 'independance day' and the x-files was based on),
army into the movie industry, marines into the TV industry,
and navy into the cruise industry.

yes, i do real intelligence work.  i write world solutions.
i have posted over 500 world solutions since 1998.  that
means i have over 500 projects going on, which have made
computer moguls into billionaires and celebrities into
millionaires.  so yes, i am a very busy man.  as opposed
to junglalien and troutpoop, who talk alot of poop to
character assasinate VIP's and are actually proud of their
crack head days. sorry, i can't relate.  i was never a crack head.
i was a prodigy, who went to a top of the line prep school and
the ivy league university in ohio that has worked most account
exec jobs with government, military, fortune 500, home
improvement, and healthcare accounts. jobs you can not even
get unless you passed a drug test and 2 interviews and had
government connections (preferably republican connections,
my parents are reagan era republicans).

so no, i don't have time for nazi plans to put down a dozen
races of people, turn them into slaves, and start more and
more foreign wars for more war profiteering.  nor do i have
time for nazi plans of accusing VIP's of being crazy to push
crazy pills on them. or do i have time for gold diggers with
sneaky greedy dem lawyers claiming marriage and divorce
when i was never married before to claim half of the $1.4
trillion i made the US federal government to bail america
out of a trillion dollar federal defecit caused by war
mongering dark tares.

what a crying shame when this list was all about the parties
before.  great events.  real underground music. great reviews.
i post one real event and the dark tare haters come in and
can't stop character assasinating me by falsely accusing me
of every black sin in the book when i never had to go thru
any black sproblems. in fact, i have been accused of being
'too white' recently.

sorry you had to go thru such shit. sorry i can't relate.  hope
things get better for you.  please stop trying to turn the beautiful
scene i started into some black gangster hip hop hell hole,
because that is obviously not what the underground rapture
i started was about!

peace, love, unity, and respect,
steve t 3169,

<br><a href="mailto:tvt3169@yahoo.com">tvt3169@yahoo.com</a> i can hook you up with travel deals<br>since i had feng shui&#39;ed alot of former US air force into<br>the travel industry.<br><br>as a former government and military recruiter and as the 
<br>international intelligence director, i had feng shui&#39;ed alot <br>of former air force into the travel industry (one of my <br>accounts during Y2K was wright patterson air force, the <br>first air force base in america named after the wright 
<br>brothers in dayton, ohio, the air force base where the <br>famous hanger 18 is at with the UFO&#39;s from roswell that <br>the film &#39;independance day&#39; and the x-files was based on), <br>army into the movie industry, marines into the TV industry, 
<br>and navy into the cruise industry.<br>&nbsp;<br>yes, i do real intelligence work.&nbsp; i write world solutions.<br>i have posted over 500 world solutions since 1998.&nbsp; that<br>means i have over 500 projects going on, which have made
<br>computer moguls into billionaires and celebrities into<br>millionaires.&nbsp; so yes, i am a very busy man.&nbsp; as opposed<br>to junglalien and troutpoop, who talk alot of poop to<br>character assasinate VIP&#39;s and are actually proud of their

<br>improvement, and healthcare accounts. jobs you can not even <br>get unless you passed a drug test and 2 interviews and had <br>government connections (preferably republican connections, <br>my parents are reagan era republicans).
<br><br>so no, i don&#39;t have time for nazi plans to put down a dozen<br>races of people, turn them into slaves, and start more and<br>more foreign wars for more war profiteering.&nbsp; nor do i have<br>time for nazi plans of accusing VIP&#39;s of being crazy to push

i post one real event and the dark tare haters come in and<br>can&#39;t stop character assasinating me by falsely accusing me<br>of every black sin in the book when i never had to go thru<br>any black sproblems. in fact, i have been accused of being

All five subjects were charged with illegal assembly or possession of  
chemicals for the manufacture of drugs. A violation of section 2925.04 of the  Ohio 
Revised Code a Felony of the Third Degree. 
I was sentenced to the PA equivalent "Liquified ammonia gas,precursors and  
chemicals" I got 9 - 23 1/2 months and 3 years probation.Pa is way  worse than 
Ohio. They'll be alright. It sucks being a felon for the rest of my  life.I 
was charged with 3 felonies (2 of which carried 2 year mandatory  minimumns) and 
4 misdemeanors and plead out to the one felony. Which is still  bullshit 
considering I never sold drugs or had the precursors. Life is not fair  but all 
you can do is move on. I wish them all luck. Someone bail them out or at  least 
put $ on their books. I can spare a couple hundred if it  helps.

house they didn't find shit.They took Benadryl (not even pseudo) and listed it  
as "allergy medicine'.What happened was this cunt that does cook meth came to 
my  house on X-Mas eve cryin sayin she has nowhere to go so I let her stay at 
my  house so she could see her kids.If it wasn't x-mas i woulda told her no 
get  lost.Well like a week later I ended up finally throwin her ass out cuz I 
didn't  want that shit in my house.It never even was made at my house.So after 
she left  there was a garbage bag in the room she was using so i just threw it 
out to the  curb.Well in the garbage was all kinds of shit enough evidence for 
meth lab.  They were supposedly lookin for her on the search warrant. She 
never got  arrested.Even my lawyer said she coulda been the CI.So she prolly set

   lol, sounds like layla.

she was a crack head that i let move in with me in ohio.  she was
a nice girl when i first met her and had given her an engagement
ring after 3 months.  unfortunately, she slept around on me with:
gerrad martin, who was an illegal drug dealer. he got her messed
up on drugs, raped her and gave her his herpes.

gerrad martin currently has a $50,000 federal bounty on his head
for four counts of involuntary manslaughter in ohio.  he also used
layla's dad's social security number to get a cell phone to make it
appear he was involved in his illegal drug trafficking.

here's what you can do: sue the pharmaceutical company she got
the pills from that she tried to set you up with.

if the pharmacutical company has a problem with being sued,
let them know you know the government agency that shot a
tomahawk missile into a pharmaceutical company for simply
manufacturing a pill that killed 1/3 of people the drug was
given to.  yes, entire pharmaceutical companies are expendable
especially if they are out in africa and manufacture pills that
have been proven to kill people.  especially since africa is
where 9/11 terrorists had come from.

btw, neither layla or mary cooked meth.  that was gerrad martin
who was associated with those tares.  meth wasn't as much as
a problem as when meth labs blew up and entire forests were
set on fire.  some mormon boys were tricked by dark tares to fire
attack some mexican houses with meth labs, unfortunately, meth
lab houses are extremely flamable and extremely  explosive.
the subsequent explosion caused thousands of acres of wildfire,
in california which has caused quite a few fire fighter deaths
in 2003 to 2007.

there was a $500,000 federal bounty on gerrad  martin.  i reduced
that federal bounty to $50,000 and re-allocated $450,000 to
california orange freeze victims.  i have the power to do so,
because i am the primary owner of the US federal government.
i have federal executive power.

FEMA did cover fire victims expenses initially, but when it was
suspected additional fires were set for FEMA insurance scams,
than FEMA stopped compensating alleged victims.

i don't know what happened to layla, but now i live in a big house
in the cali valley with a pool in the back in a predominantly republican
military neighborhood (security is so tight here a mex tried stealing
my bike got nabbed and 9 other mexicans got shot for it in san diego
on labor day) after selling a half mill house in vegas with an 18 hole
golf course in the back that went to pay off the house i live in now
(also worth about a half mill).  the only problem i have is some dark
tares took my dad's cadi and he often takes the mercedes with my
name on the back of it when he goes on call since he's an old school
republican doctor that should've retired and moved out 4 years ago.

hope things get better for you,

<div>The only evidence they had on me was 2 confidential informants talkin 
shit.Then they took my garbage from the curb and found stuff.When they raided my 
house they didn&#39;t find shit.They took Benadryl (not even pseudo) and listed it 
as &quot;allergy medicine&#39;.What happened was this cunt that does cook meth came to my 
house on X-Mas eve cryin sayin she has nowhere to go so I let her stay at my 
house so she could see her kids.If it wasn&#39;t x-mas i woulda told her no get 
lost.Well like a week later I ended up finally throwin her ass out cuz I didn&#39;t 
want that shit in my house.It never even was made at my house.So after she left 
there was a garbage bag in the room she was using so i just threw it out to the 
curb.Well in the garbage was all kinds of shit enough evidence for meth lab. 
They were supposedly lookin for her on the search warrant. She never got 
arrested.Even my lawyer said she coulda been the CI.So she prolly set me 
up.......</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I did 9 months and&nbsp;4 years paper and am now labeled a felon for 
letting a homeless person stay at my house on X-mas...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>What pissed me off the most is they smashed down my doors ran in with 
assault rifles,there was an armored vehicle in my front yard,hazmat,news 
cameras.....If I sold drugs I would expect something like that.I worked for a 
living.Why was this happening to me?I was furious i called them everyname in the 
book.Refused to cooperate with them that&#39;s why they banged me.I was charged with 
3 felonies and 4 misdemeanors.I plead to one felony and one misdemeanor.I sold 
my house to pay for lawyer and PI.I lost everything I ever worked for.I&#39;m just 
glad its over</div></div></font></div></blockquote></div><br><form name="frmAddAddrs" action="http://address.mail.yahoo.com/yab/us?v=YM&amp;.rand=5193&amp;A=m&amp;simp=1" method="post">

<font size="2">lol, sounds like layla.<br><br>she was a crack head that i let move in with me in ohio.&nbsp; she was<br>a nice girl when i first met her and had given her an engagement<br>ring after 3 months.&nbsp; unfortunately, she slept around on me with:
<br>gerrad martin, who was an illegal drug dealer. he got her messed<br>up on drugs, raped her and gave her his herpes.&nbsp; <br><br>gerrad martin currently has a $50,000 federal bounty on his head <br>for four counts of involuntary manslaughter in ohio.&nbsp; he also used 
<br>layla&#39;s dad&#39;s social security number to get a cell phone to make it <br>appear he was involved in his illegal drug trafficking.<br><br>here&#39;s what you can do: sue the pharmaceutical company she got <br>the pills from that she tried to set you up with.
<br><br>if the pharmacutical company has a problem with being sued,<br>let them know you know the government agency that shot a<br>tomahawk missile into a pharmaceutical company for simply<br>manufacturing a pill that killed 1/3 of people the drug was 
<br>given to.&nbsp; yes, entire pharmaceutical companies are expendable<br>especially if they are out in africa and manufacture pills that <br>have been proven to kill people.&nbsp; especially since africa is<br>where 9/11 terrorists had come from.
<br><br>btw, neither layla or mary cooked meth.&nbsp; that was gerrad martin<br>who was associated with those tares.&nbsp; meth wasn&#39;t as much as <br>a problem as when meth labs blew up
 and entire forests were <br>set on fire.&nbsp; some mormon boys were tricked by dark tares to fire <br>attack some mexican houses with meth labs, unfortunately, meth <br>lab houses are extremely flamable and extremely&nbsp; explosive.&nbsp; 
<br>the subsequent explosion caused thousands of acres of wildfire, <br>in california which has caused quite a few fire fighter deaths<br>in 2003 to 2007.<br><br>there was a $500,000 federal bounty on gerrad&nbsp; martin.&nbsp; i reduced 
<br>that federal bounty to $50,000 and re-allocated $450,000 to <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer;" id="lw_1189839123_0"><br>california</span> orange freeze victims.&nbsp; i have the power to do so, 
<br>because i am the primary owner of the US federal government.&nbsp; <br>i have federal executive power.<br><br>FEMA did cover fire victims expenses initially, but when it was <br>suspected additional fires were set for FEMA insurance scams, 
<br>than FEMA stopped compensating alleged
 victims.<br><br>i don&#39;t know what happened to layla, but now i live in a big house <br>in the cali valley with a pool in the back in a predominantly republican<br>military neighborhood (security is so tight here a mex tried stealing
<br>my bike got nabbed and 9 other mexicans got shot for it in san diego<br>on labor day) after selling a half mill house in vegas with an 18 hole <br>golf course in the back that went to pay off the house i live in now <br>
(also worth about a half mill).&nbsp; the only problem i have is some dark <br>tares took my dad&#39;s cadi and he often takes the mercedes with my <br>name on the back of it when he goes on call since he&#39;s an old school <br>
republican doctor that should&#39;ve retired and moved out 4 years ago.<br><br>hope things get better for you,<br>steve t 3169,<br>international intelligence director<br>primary owner US federal government ($1.4 trillion investment from japan and china
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; in US treasury bonds)<br>primary owner state government of california ($8 billion investment in US treasury bond)<br>primary owner state government of nevada (indian gaming casinos cover nevada state gov)<br>primary owner state government of utah (initiated $25 billion oil drilling project)

I thought I was the only "jailhead" on here.
 
So we should have Akon headline a party.
 
Someone should at least remix "Locked Up"
 
Jail sucked but it did have so positive influence on my life. There were a  
lot of real pieces of shit in there but I met some real good people that  just 
made a mistake. I'm actually glad I had the experience.

As a third party on this one, I can say folks get on Entropy's nuts because
he talks shit on people in a holier-than-thou, born-again-Christian,
far-right-wing kinda way, but has a past history including raves, drugs, and
porn.  Or, more concisely, because of perceived hypocrisy on his part.

Were they talking shit on him for what he's done directly, they themselves
would now be hypocrites.

Either way, it sounds like bad times ahead for the Varsity Captain of the
PbCle.

Cathy, do yourself and the rest of us a favor and unsub yourself from the list.

your behavior is unacceptable and no one has any respect for you 
after you come out and say shit like that. (this is assuming that 
they ever did)  If I knew where you lived, i'd personally rip the 
network card out of your computer so that none of us have to listen 
to you anymore.

please go away.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Trout

We have put a paypal account together for JUST such a purpose.

As lawyer retainers and legal fees are becoming a very real and 
immediate issue, I am asking you to donate whatever you can for 
trout's legal defense.  He has done more for the "scene" than almost 
anyone I know and never asks for more than crude sexual favors in 
return.  (just kidding... maybe)  In all seriousness, we do need your 
help. Maximums on the charges against him carry sentences beyond 5 
years,  and no one wants to lose trout to daily ass-rapings in jail.

Please make your donations to catchandreleasetrout@gmail.com via 
paypal.  Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated.  We are 
waiting for the account to be verified, but we are still able to take 
donations.

Trout and the rest of us fighting on his behalf appreciate your help.

Brian

Please forward this wherever people that are able to help out will see it.

no. that is out of the question.

although i am seriously considering cutting federal financing to the DEA,
because federal funds are strapped and it costs tax payers money to keep
people in jail.  i am actually for the legalization of marijuana and
ecstacy,
so tax payers do not have to pay to keep them in jail.  and space is needed
for much worse criminals like homicide and arsonists.

gov. schwarzenegger has complained several times concerning the jails
being packed in california, expressed the need to send prisoners out of
state, and the need to build additional jails. both i veto'ed as the primar=
y
owner of the state government of california, because i felt california leve=
e
repair and valley hydro-electricity were much more important cali
development projects than any additional jails.

i want the record to show i never authorized this bust.  the dems have
started some of their own agencies.  for instance all of a sudden there is
a fresno county sherrif department here in fresno, when it has always
previously been just fresno police department. as a result there are
all kinds of jurisdiction viiolation problems and financing problems.
they specialize in unauthorized meth busts, when they have not been
fully trained for it yet.  they need K9 units, bullet proof vests, and
training methods of how to properly dispose of materials if indeed
it is a meth lab since meth labs are explosive and can cause massive
forest fires if it is located in the woods.  for instance, if an officer
smokes
and enters a lab with flammable fumes, the whole place, the surrounding
woods, and the officer blows up.  the DEA is the agency that is supposed
to do drug busts, because the DEA has proper training and proper
equipment.  sherrif department usually only handle rural areas
predominantly writing speeding tickets of people who speed through
rural counties.

one meth lab they busted, didn't even look like a real meth lab, it
looked like a coors beer ball that some black gang member set up
to look like a meth lab to send them on a wild goose chase so the
dark tares can rob the other side of town, which they did on black
friday (the friday before x-mas).

fresno is no longer rural, it is definitly a city now, which the fresno
police
department handles.  but recently due to budget problems the fresno
sheriff's department has been making jurisdiction violations and making
busts and arrests within city limits, this inadvertantly takes away city
money.
so far the city has been nice about it because it knows county had been
suffering from some budget problems, but county's budget problem is now
beginining to cause a city budget problem.  my solution was for county to
do more fairs, in fact i will be delegating security for the oktoberfest
here
in california to fresno county sherrif's department, where they may make
DUI arrests, but i also have a solution for that being mormon designated
driver program.

fresno oktoberfest's security was previously handled by hells angels,
who also did the poker run last year (motorcycle parade followed by
a texas hold 'em poker tournament, but this year i think i'm going to
add hell's angels to the undercover love fest staff since they are based
in san francisco and fresno is 4 hours away from san francisco).  previousl=

raves, drugs, and porn are not illegal. raves are only illegal if there is
illegal
drug trafficking in the rave. so hire a cop to do door checks and you should

be fine. don't invite al quida jinx types, organized criminal gerrad martin
types, or taliban favor types.

not all drugs are illegal.  but on the top of the list for drugs to keep out
are:
crack, meth, and heroin, because those drugs have killed people before.

porn is not illegal. federal law it is the producer of child pornography
that is
illegal.  meaning porn with performers under 18.  most child porn is made
in germany.  troutpoop has tried to spam me with teen porn before, except
federal law mandates it is the producer of child pornography that breaks
federal laws, not the recipient, you can spam anyone with porn.  even the
US president has gotten porn in their e-mail boxes before.

in fact, i have recently been making sure actresses are over 18 in adult
films
or else they can not be released in theatres, like the chinese theatre.

also, just because ange lee decided to put out broke back mountain,
which i have never even seen yet nor do i care to go see, since i am not
gay, doesn't make republicans gay.  and for the record, love parade is not
a gay parade. it originally started in berlin, germany by dr. motte when
he like myself thrrew 2 big speakers in the back of his truck and blasted
some techno down the street.  about 150 people followed him to the
town square, they danced the night away and that was the first love
parade.  it was patterned after the ford bronco II that i had from 1986 to
1995
with 2000 watt eliminator speakers that blasted hardcore gabba techno that i

used to spin on WRUW 91.1 FM college radio and the ZBT, Sigma Chi, FIJI,
Alpha Phi Block Parties that i was involved in 1989, 1990, 1991, etc. when
jim raishart (originally reichart) and lars fisher were my little brothers
at ZBT
and were also WRUW 91.1 FM college radio DJ's.

ironically, the music i used for my final project for drama class featured a
fish bowl and the song "big brother" by alien factory, who is actually
mueller.
lol, my first music video.  a far cry from chemical brother's - salmon dance
video http://youtube.com/watch?v=kJEacTZmd7I

chemical brothers were booked for the utra event politics of dance the year
after paul van dyk was booked in central park new york.  i first got paul
van
dyk booked at red zone night club in columbus, ohio, before i got him
booked in california for go venture's idependence day events at the LA
coliseum after paul posted a comment on my myspace.com site:
myspace.com/stevet3169 requesting to be booked in america again.
paul van dyk was the headliner DJ for previous Love Parade's in berlin,
germany.

i posted the whole love parade history on the blog section of my new site:
myspace.com/rapture3169

that is correct. amanda was originally investigated because she had
"meth" in her e-mail name.  i told her to change it too.  see what
happens when you ignore steve t, the international intelligence
director, the primary owner of the US federal government!

troutpoop was originally investigated because he publicly posted
his hate of microsoft and AOL.  but was deeply investigated because
he confessed to releasing computer viruses right before the NE-blackouts,
3 days of black-outs in NE-America that caused $6 billion dollars loss
of business for NYC alone.  but the worse part was, it also caused a
slight radiation leak at the Davis-Besse nulcear power plant in erie,
ohio.  for all those who knew about Chernobyl, know exactly how
dangerous it can be when there is a radiation leak.

Bill Gates at Microsoft originally laid down a $5 million dollar federal
bounty on troutpoop's head.  but troutpoop was able to get away with
it by getting a 17 year old german boy to take the blame.  just as
troutpoop wanted me to take the blame for taliban favor's opium
when unfortunately i come from a reagan era republican family
and was originally scouted by the defense department for NORAD
in the 80's during the reagan administration for my high scores at
missile command.  i was a bit of a prodigy at an early age, i was
drawing in 3D at the age of 5 as well, and I was the first one to
solve the rubics cube in my town when it came out.  in addition,
like i said i was first used for federal investigations in 1994 at MBNA
when Louie Freeh was the FBI Director and exec at MBNA and had
used MBNA as a front for some financial investigations.  my last
job in Ohio was a federal government job, where i got people jobs
in government, US military, fortune 500 company, and healthcare
jobs.  most jobs i had one cant get without passing a drug test and
2 interviews.  i dont even smoke cigarettes.

unfortunately the media persists in trying to treat the underground
scene, which i helped start in ohio like a bunch of crack heads due
to a few crack head idiots, who ruined the scene for us.  some of which
have been busted, but had nothing to do with the founding of the
underground scene and were actually quite shunned in the beginning.
people like al quida jinx, who got smart bar busted due to his under-
age drinking, metropolis busted due to his cocaine trafficking, red
zone busted due to his gang killing someone at red zone, his
involvement in the 420 riots and bragging the WTC would be the
ultimate insurance scam right before 9/11 obviously did not help
out the scene at all.

organized criminal gerrad martin, who is wanted on four counts of
involuntary man slaughter and taliban favor, who threatened the us
government with chemical warfare right before the RICIN attack on the
US senate and was the number one suspect behind the west nile virus
attack on gov. schwarzenegger, also did not help things at all.  add to
that the $125 billion loss of business caused by dark tares falsely accusing

asians of opium (when in reality asians regard opium as jews regard
swastikas ever since the emperor hacked heads to get opium out of china)
to justify stealing imported japanese cars to keep for themselves or to sell

on the black market, as well as the cali wildfires caused by black hate of
mexicans, then you understand my dillemma as the one started west coast
homeland security in 2003.

that is correct. amanda was originally investigated because she had<br>&quot;meth&quot; in her e-mail name.&nbsp; i told her to change it too.&nbsp; see what<br>happens when you ignore steve t, the international intelligence<br>director, the primary owner of the US federal government!
<br><br>troutpoop was originally investigated because he publicly posted<br>his hate of microsoft and AOL.&nbsp; but was deeply investigated because<br>he confessed to releasing computer viruses right before the NE-blackouts,<br>
3 days of black-outs in NE-America that caused $6 billion dollars loss<br>of business for NYC alone.&nbsp; but the worse part was, it also caused a<br>slight radiation leak at the Davis-Besse nulcear power plant in erie,<br>ohio.&nbsp; for all those who knew about Chernobyl, know exactly how
<br>dangerous it can be when there is a radiation leak.<br><br>Bill Gates at Microsoft originally laid down a $5 million dollar federal<br>bounty on troutpoop&#39;s head.&nbsp; but troutpoop was able to get away with<br>it by getting a 17 year old german boy to take the blame.&nbsp; just as
<br>troutpoop wanted me to take the blame for taliban favor&#39;s opium<br>when unfortunately i come from a reagan era republican family<br>and was originally scouted by the defense department for NORAD <br>in the 80&#39;s during the reagan administration for my high scores at
<br>missile command.&nbsp; i was a bit of a prodigy at an early age, i was<br>drawing in 3D at the age of 5 as well, and I was the first one to<br>solve the rubics cube in my town when it came out.&nbsp; in addition,<br>like i said i was first used for federal investigations in 1994 at MBNA
<br>when Louie Freeh was the FBI Director and exec at MBNA and had<br>used MBNA as a front for some financial investigations.&nbsp; my last<br>job in Ohio was a federal government job, where i got people jobs<br>in government, US military, fortune 500 company, and healthcare
<br>jobs.&nbsp; most jobs i had one cant get without passing a drug test and<br>2 interviews.&nbsp; i dont even smoke cigarettes.&nbsp; <br><br>unfortunately the media persists in trying to treat the underground <br>scene, which i helped start in ohio like a bunch of crack heads due

_TheAgitator.com: American  Gulag: Comments_ 
(http://www.theagitator.com/archives/026598.php)  
American  Gulag 
_According to new data_ 
(http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1110AP_Prison_Population.html)  from the U.S. Department of  Justice, one in 136 Americans 
is behind bars today, including an astounding 12  percent of all black men 
between the ages of 25 and 29. The United States  represents 4.6 percent of the 
world's population, but houses nearly 23 percent  of humanity's prison 
population. Certainly, part of this is likely due to  politicians' unfortunate habit 
of _addressing every social problem with a new law_ 
(http://www.catostore.org/index.asp?fa=ProductDetails&method=cats&scid=33&pid=1441226) , but  much of it 
is due to our ever-more-draconian drug laws. A few more statistics to  chew on 
from the latest edition of _Drug War  Facts_ (http://www.drugwarfacts.org/) , 
published by Common Sense for Drug Policy:  
As of 2005, drug offenders accounted for 55 percent of the federal prison  
population. About 45 percent of them were in prison for possession, not  
trafficking.  
The number of people incarcerated in federal prisons for drug crimes rose  
from 14,976 in 1986 to 68,360 in 1999.  
It costs U.S. taxpayers $3 billion per year to keep drug offenders behind  
bars in federal prisons.  
Drug offenders have accounted for nearly half the meteoric growth in  prison 
populations since 1995.  
About half the population of U.S. jails and prisons are nonviolent  
offenders, more than the combined populations of Wyoming and Alaska.  
Forty percent of the more than 1,000 state prisons in the U.S. opened in  
just the last 25 years. The state of Texas alone has opened an average of 5.7  
new prisons each year for the last 21 years. Despite this, about half of  
federal and state prisons operate over capacity.  
Total U.S. inmates numbered 488,000 in 1985, 1.3 million in 2001, and  number 
2.2 million today.  
According to survey data by human rights groups, one in five U.S. prison  
inmates has been sexually assaulted.  
According to federal sentencing guidelines, a man would need to possess 50  
times more powder cocaine (prefered by white users) than crack cocaine  
(prefered by black users) to earn the same prison sentence.  
Blacks represent about 12 percent of the U.S. population, but 48 percent  of 
the prison population. They represent just 13 percent of drug users, but 38  
percent of those arrested for drug crimes, and 59 percent of those convicted.  
When convicted of the same drug felony, blacks are about 50 percent more  
likely to be sentenced to prison than whites.  
A black woman's chances of spending some time in prison over the course of  
her life (5.6 percent) is about equal that of a white man (5.9 percent). For  
black men, the odds are nearly one in three (32.2%).  
Before Congress passed mandatory minimums for offenses related to crack  (but 
which didn't apply to powder cocaine) in 1986, the average drug-related  
sentence for blacks was 11 percent higher than for whites. After that law, the  
disparity jumped to 49 percent.
Despite all of this, overall drug use in this country hasn't substantially  
abated. _According to government survey data_ 
(http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/druguse/#table1) , the percentage of  people 
reporting illicit drug use in their lifetimes rose from 31.3 percent in  1979 to 35.8 
percent in 1998. Between 1999 and 2001, the figure went from 39.7  to 41.1 
(data prior to 1998 isn't comparable to data after 1998 due to changes  in 
methodology). The percentage of college students reporting having used  marijuana in 
the last year went from 27.9 percent in 1993 to 33.7 percent in  2003; the 
number using in the past month went from 14.2 percent to 19.3 percent;  and the 
number reporting daily use went from 1.9 percent to 4.7 percent. 
Interestingly, all of these increases have come from people over 18 years of  
age. Drug use among minors is significantly down. Which means that even as 
adult  Americans are more likely to take recreational drugs than they once were 
(and  given _these figures_ 
(http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/05/16/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-guardrails/) , with little corresponding social harm),  
they're doing a good job of steering their kids away from them. 
Nevertheless, the government continues to arrest and incarcerate drug  
offenders, and in fact is now expanding its reach to include not just  recreational 
users and traffickers, but _doctors_ 
(http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3778)  and _patients_ (http://www.cato.org/events/010327pf.html)  who use 
controlled drugs to treat illnesses in  ways the drug warriors have determined 
are "outside the scope of legitimate  medical practice." 
One wonders what percentage of Americans will need to be in prison before our 
 politicians find the courage to say "enough."

start looking for a new list administrator. This is no joke.They are probally  
doing jail time.If they were in PA at least 10 years.

(screw it, don't feel like removing all the CC's)

I have been, umm, "out of it" to say the least over the past week.  I
was going to post this information earlier but seriously had to get out
and get some fresh air.  I think I'm freakin out about this more than
the people involved.

I will vouch that it is legit (like it's been said, you don't know of
teh silverraver... pssht) I bet my... umm... computers I guess since I
hold those dearly.  If that is not the address may you get all
computers, with all the music on them and all the secret photos that I
don't post anywhere but keep around for the heck of it and all the dvds
I've ripped so far.

One thing we do ask is that we set this up as a personal account so
paypal doesn't rape us on fees.  This means we're limited in the amount
of credit card transactions it can take.  So if it is possible, please
use your bank account.  I plan on sending money to that address as soon
as I realize just how much I can put up after I pay all the bills I need to.

Again, I give you my word that the address is
catchandreleasetrout@gmail.com .  Let anyone know that may be able to
help (I am not on most of the other lists, and won't subscribe as most
people won't know me on them).

First I'd like to state there is a major difference in the criminal justice  
and political systems between Ohio and Pennsylvania. Pa being one of only 2  
commonwealth states in the country has a fukked up system. I don't know how  
things work in Ohio but I am always amazed to see it seems like you get a slap  
on the wrist compared to what you get here. 
 
Western Erie county is the meth capital of Pennsylvania. During the last 5  
or so years there has been a witch hunt. I have seen dozens of cases similar to 
 the one here and I have know several people that have been imprisoned. No 
one  has ever taking a case like this to trial and won. The last person I seen 
take  it to trial got 25 years state. From the media reports they have more 
than  enough evidence to convict someone for manufacture. I'm glad to see that 
they  only received the one charge. Over here they would have had 10-20 charges. 
A  search warrant requires an affidavit of probable cause. The evidence 
contained  within is usually enough to convict.
 
I knew someone over here that was raided and they found less than what they  
took from them and when the Max of his charges was added up he was looking at  
115 years. They hit you with so many charges so you take a plea to something  
less.
 
Another example: Someone was storing some glassware and hotplate at another  
persons house.
No chemicals or drug paraphernalia 2-4 years
 
Another newer law requiring you to show I. D. to purchase pseudo  
ephedrine.Feds went around to all the pharmacies got the logs.Seen where one guy  
purchased 42 boxes within 2 days. (I know you got to be an idiot to show your ID  but 
when your spun you do stupid shit) He is now serving 7 years in federal  
prison. If the feds come for you there is no hope.
 
On the average it seems to me that people raided for labs end up doing 2-4  
years state. Federally 10-20 years. 
 
>From what the media said they confiscated from this raid there is an  
overwhelming amount of evidence. I predict at least one person is doing a  minimum of 
2 years. That's if other charges are brought up.If they just get the  one 
charge they could possibly get away with supervision.If they gotta deal with  
public pretenders than they are screwed all the more. One thing I noticed they  
confiscated vehicles. No one over here has ever had vehicles or property seized 
 for some reason. 
 
I'd like to see the affidavit of probable cause for the search warrant.Does  
anyone know if you can access that information online?
 

The reason no one beats it at trial is because all jury members know about  
meth is what they see on the news. Basically its evil and you can make it with  
stuff from the hardware store.The police show them some allergy medicine a  
bottle of rubbing alcohol and say right here is the evidence and they believe  
them. I suppose if you spent hundreds of thousands of dollars  on legal  
representation , private investigators and hired chemist for expert witness. You  
could possibly convince them your innocent. Another thing to consider...A lot 
of  times there are raids and busts with no media coverage. When there is media 
 coverage they are usually out to set an example, or possibly they are 
content  shutting down the operation,humiliating,exposing these people and getting 
them  out of the neighborhood.
 
I have mixed feelings about the "meth epidemic" over here. I would say  stiff 
efforts of law enforcement have been successful in the sense that a couple  
few years ago it seemed like everyone you met was spun out of their mind  
including myself. One good thing jail did was get me off that  
shit....however....who's to say I wouldn't have done it myself. While I won't  deny meth ruins 
lives...I have never heard of one person dying from an overdose.  And with the 
exaggerations of how dangerous explosive and toxic meth labs are...  I've never 
heard or seen a meth lab explosion or seen anyone harmed by the  "toxic" 
byproducts. So why are they throwing everyone in jail? Because they want  to stay 
up all night? End punitive drug policies that cause the widespread  violation 
of constitutional and human rights, as well as unprecedented levels of  
incarceration. I think drug abuse should be a medical issue not criminal justice  
issue.
The way law enforcement uses informants sickens me. The die hard  criminals 
get a get out of jail free card. And people with integrity go to jail.  Its 
like George Orwell's 1984 you can't trust anyone because they are all  snitches. 
People that get someone else in trouble to get themselves out of  trouble are 
the scum of the earth.As for the bill of rights...ha ha..a thing of  the 
past.They got ways to get around everyone of your supposed rights. Aren't  you 
supposed to feel safe and secure in your home?All they need to do is say one  
snitch said you were doing something illegal and they can smash your doors down  
and run in with assault rifles.They don't have to reveal the identity of their  
informants.So much for having the right to confront your accuser. I don't 
know  how things played out...but his resisting arrest charge is an indication to 
me  that Trout is a man of integrity and honor. I'm just sorry he had to find 
out  the hard way like myself that we have no more rights and Big Brother can 
do as  he pleases.
I better shut up before they set me up again..........
Does  this make sense to you? Or do you think I'm another Stevie  T?

Subject:    {pb-cle} My situation
The only evidence they had on me was 2 confidential informants talkin
shit.Then they took my garbage from the curb and found stuff.When they
raided my house they didn't find shit.They took Benadryl (not even pseudo)
and listed it as "allergy medicine'.What happened was this cunt that does
cook meth came to my house on X-Mas eve cryin sayin she has nowhere to go so
I let her stay at my house so she could see her kids.If it wasn't x-mas i
woulda told her no get lost.Well like a week later I ended up finally
throwin her ass out cuz I didn't want that shit in my house.It never even
was made at my house.So after she left there was a garbage bag in the room
she was using so i just threw it out to the curb.Well in the garbage was all
kinds of shit enough evidence for meth lab. They were supposedly lookin for
her on the search warrant. She never got arrested.Even my lawyer said she
coulda been the CI.So she prolly set me up.......

I did 9 months and 4 years paper and am now labeled a felon for letting a
homeless person stay at my house on X-mas...

What pissed me off the most is they smashed down my doors ran in with
assault rifles,there was an armored vehicle in my front yard,hazmat,news
cameras.....If I sold drugs I would expect something like that.I worked for
a living.Why was this happening to me?I was furious i called them everyname
in the book.Refused to cooperate with them that's why they banged me.I was
charged with 3 felonies and 4 misdemeanors.I plead to one felony and one
misdemeanor.I sold my house to pay for lawyer and PI.I lost everything I
ever worked for.I'm just glad its over

lol, sounds like layla.

she was a crack head that i let move in with me in ohio.  she was
a nice girl when i first met her and had given her an engagement
ring after 3 months.  unfortunately, she slept around on me with:
gerrad martin, who was an illegal drug dealer. he got her messed
up on drugs, raped her and gave her his herpes.

sue the pharmaceutical company she got the pills from that she
tried to set you up with.

if the pharmacutical company has a problem with being sued,
let them know you know the government agency that shot a
tomahawk missile into a pharmaceutical company for simply
manufacturing a pill that killed 1/3 of people the drug was
given to.  yes, entire pharmaceutical companies are expendable
especially if they are out in africa and manufacture pills that
have been proven to kill people.  especially since africa is
where 9/11 terrorists had come from.

btw, neither layla or mary cooked meth.  that was gerrad martin
who was associated with those tares.  meth wasn't as much as
a problem as when meth labs blew up and entire forests were
set on fire.  some mormon boys were tricked by dark tares to fire
attack some mexican houses with meth labs, unfortunately, meth
lab houses are extremely flamable and extremely  explosive.  the
subsequent explosion caused thousands of acres of cali wildfires,
which caused some cali fire fighter deaths in california in 2003 to
2007.

that and because gerrad martin is wanted for 4 counts of involuntary
man slaughter is why there was a $500,000 federal bounty on gerrad
martin.  i reduced that federal bounty to $50,000 and re-allocated
$450,000 to california orange freeze victims.  i have the power to do so,
because i am the primary owner of the US federal government.  i have
federal executive power.

FEMA did cover victims expenses initially, but when it was
suspected additional fires were set for FEMA insurance scams,
than FEMA stopped compensating alleged victims.

i don't know what happened to layla, but now i live in a big house
in the cali valley with a pool in the back in a predominantly republican
military neighborhood (security is so tight here a mex tried stealing
my bike got nabbed and 9 other mexicans got shot for it in san diego
on labor day) after selling a half mill house in vegas with an 18 hole
golf course in the back that went to pay off the house i live in now
(also worth about a half mill).  the only problem i have is some dark
tares took my dad's cadi and he often takes the mercedes with my
name on the back of it when he goes on call since he's an old school
republican doctor that should've retired and moved out 4 years ago.

hope things get better for you,

steve t 3169,
international intelligence director

p.s. I was the one who personally recommended the FBI as part of the secret
security force during the Olympics in Greece and Winter Olympics in Torino,
Italy.  so they are definitly being considered as part of the security force
during the coming Olympics in Beijing, China along with Interpol
in lieu of the bio-terrorism concerns raised by myself and gov. arnold
schwarzenegger.

the biggest threats to China in the past has been SARS and AIDS,
both traced to Africa.  and as with the World Cups in Germany,
women of the night shall be screened to keep STD's away from
atheletes.  also in lieu of the bad treatment of asian investors by
mexicans and democrats, Interpol and FBI and Homeland Security
shall be used to monitor mexicans and democrats who target
asian investors, mostly for identity theft scams.

previous Olympics some atheletes were disqualified due to
steroids and ephedrine used in cold medicine, so security shall
also keep an eye out for dark tares who seek to push illegal drugs
to atheletes in attempts to disqualify them.  these dark tares shall
be immediately ejected from the games and possibly the country
if caught.

 wow, XXXjunglealienXXX back on the list trying to convince kids
 they are crazy to push drugs, so what is new?!

unfortunately, i am nothing like XXXjunglealienXXX and never had
any mental problems.  i've worked mostly fortune 500 company jobs
with government, military, and fortune 500 company accounts.

you are not the first poser doctor that tried to push drugs on me.
several dem lawyers pretending to be psychiatrist were just recently
busted in california for it.  they are now spending 7 years in a fed
pen.  it is against federal law to push drugs without being a board
certified doctor.  unfortunately, being a sneaky greedy dem lawyer
with fake degrees did not qualify.

i feel sorry for you XXXjunglealienXXX, all these years and you
are still  pushing drugs and confessing to the world you were mental.
has anyone noticed crazy people think everybody else in the world is
crazy too?  this would explain your twisted definition of mania.
by your definition, hulka-mania fans are all insane and need to
take the pills you are pushing to survive.  when in reality, i think
most hulk fans would rather throw you than have to take the pills
you are pushing.

ah, the glory days when the underground scene was about the
rapture, the heavenly music, the peace, the love, the unity, and
the respect before the obvious tares came in, hi-jacked pb-cle-raves
to push drugs.  sometimes i wonder if they actually believe the
crap they are spewing to justify their obvious drug pushing.

hmmm, didn't troutpoop confess he was XXXjunglalienXXX before?
wouldn't surprise me.  it would explain alot, seeing as how he used
to spam me with his fecal porn fetish and copies of his hitler stamps.

no. that is out of the question.

although i am seriously considering cutting federal financing to the DEA,
because federal funds are strapped and it costs tax payers money to keep
people in jail.  i am actually for the legalization of marijuana and
ecstacy,
so tax payers do not have to pay to keep them in jail.  and space is needed
for much worse criminals like homicide and arsonists.

gov. schwarzenegger has complained several times concerning the jails
being packed in california, expressed the need to send prisoners out of
state, and the need to build additional jails. both i veto'ed as the primary
owner of the state government of california, because i felt california levee
repair and valley hydro-electricity were much more important cali
development projects than any additional jails.

i want the record to show i never authorized this bust.  the dems have
started some of their own agencies.  for instance all of a sudden there is
a fresno county sherrif department here in fresno, when it has always
previously been just fresno police department. as a result there are
all kinds of jurisdiction viiolation problems and financing problems.
they specialize in unauthorized meth busts, when they have not been
fully trained for it yet.  they need K9 units, bullet proof vests, and
training methods of how to properly dispose of materials if indeed
it is a meth lab since meth labs are explosive and can cause massive
forest fires if it is located in the woods.  for instance, if an officer
smokes
and enters a lab with flammable fumes, the whole place, the surrounding
woods, and the officer blows up.  the DEA is the agency that is supposed
to do drug busts, because the DEA has proper training and proper
equipment.  sherrif department usually only handle rural areas
predominantly writing speeding tickets of people who speed through
rural counties.

one meth lab they busted, didn't even look like a real meth lab, it
looked like a coors beer ball that some black gang member set up
to look like a meth lab to send them on a wild goose chase so the
dark tares can rob the other side of town, which they did on black
friday (the friday before x-mas).

fresno is no longer rural, it is definitly a city now, which the fresno
police
department handles.  but recently due to budget problems the fresno
sheriff's department has been making jurisdiction violations and making
busts and arrests within city limits, this inadvertantly takes away city
money.
so far the city has been nice about it because it knows county had been
suffering from some budget problems, but county's budget problem is now
beginining to cause a city budget problem.  my solution was for county to
do more fairs, in fact i will be delegating security for the oktoberfest
here
in california to fresno county sherrif's department, where they may make
DUI arrests, but i also have a solution for that being mormon designated
driver program.

fresno oktoberfest's security was previously handled by hells angels,
who also did the poker run last year (motorcycle parade followed by
a texas hold 'em poker tournament, but this year i think i'm going to
add hell's angels to the undercover love fest staff since they are based
in san francisco and fresno is 4 hours away from san francisco).  previously
i had invited pope joseph ratzinger out to oktoberfest, but he hasn't been
able to make it out yet. here are the details to the oktoberfest in
california...

that is correct. amanda was originally investigated because she had
"meth" in her e-mail name.  i told her to change it too.  see what
happens when you ignore steve t, the international intelligence
director, the primary owner of the US federal government!

troutpoop was originally investigated because he publicly posted
his hate of microsoft and AOL.  but was deeply investigated because
he confessed to releasing computer viruses right before the NE-blackouts,
3 days of black-outs in NE-America that caused $6 billion dollars loss
of business for NYC alone.  but the worse part was, it also caused a
slight radiation leak at the Davis-Besse nulcear power plant in erie,
ohio.  for all those who knew about Chernobyl, know exactly how
dangerous it can be when there is a radiation leak.

Bill Gates at Microsoft originally laid down a $5 million dollar federal
bounty on troutpoop's head.  but troutpoop was able to get away with
it by getting a 17 year old german boy to take the blame.  just as
troutpoop wanted me to take the blame for taliban favor's opium
when unfortunately i come from a reagan era republican family
and was originally scouted by the defense department for NORAD
in the 80's during the reagan administration for my high scores at
missile command.  i was a bit of a prodigy at an early age, i was
drawing in 3D at the age of 5 as well, and I was the first one to
solve the rubics cube in my town when it came out.  in addition,
like i said i was first used for federal investigations in 1994 at MBNA
when Louie Freeh was the FBI Director and exec at MBNA and had
used MBNA as a front for some financial investigations.  my last
job in Ohio was a federal government job, where i got people jobs
in government, US military, fortune 500 company, and healthcare
jobs.  most jobs i had one cant get without passing a drug test and
2 interviews.  i dont even smoke cigarettes.

unfortunately the media persists in trying to treat the underground
scene, which i helped start in ohio like a bunch of crack heads due
to a few crack head idiots, who ruined the scene for us.  some of which
have been busted, but had nothing to do with the founding of the
underground scene and were actually quite shunned in the beginning.
people like al quida jinx, who got smart bar busted due to his under-
age drinking, metropolis busted due to his cocaine trafficking, red
zone busted due to his gang killing someone at red zone, his
involvement in the 420 riots and bragging the WTC would be the
ultimate insurance scam right before 9/11 obviously did not help
out the scene at all.

organized criminal gerrad martin, who is wanted on four counts of
involuntary man slaughter and taliban favor, who threatened the us
government with chemical warfare right before the RICIN attack on the
US senate and was the number one suspect behind the west nile virus
attack on gov. schwarzenegger, also did not help things at all.  add to
that the $125 billion loss of business caused by dark tares falsely accusing
asians of opium (when in reality asians regard opium as jews regard
swastikas ever since the emperor hacked heads to get opium out of china)
to justify stealing imported japanese cars to keep for themselves or to sell
on the black market, as well as the cali wildfires caused by black hate of
mexicans, then you understand my dilemma as the one who started west
coast  homeland security in 2003.

 I have mixed feelings about the "meth epidemic" over here. I would say
stiff efforts of law enforcement have been successful in the sense that a
couple few years ago it seemed like everyone you met was spun out of their
mind including myself. One good thing jail did was get me off that
shit....however....who's to say I wouldn't have done it myself. While I
won't deny meth ruins lives...I have never heard of one person dying from an
overdose. And with the exaggerations of how dangerous explosive and toxic
meth labs are... I've never heard or seen a meth lab explosion or seen
anyone harmed by the "toxic" byproducts. So why are they throwing everyone
in jail? Because they want to stay up all night? End punitive drug policies
that cause the widespread violation of constitutional and human rights, as
well as unprecedented levels of incarceration. I think drug abuse should be
a medical issue not criminal justice issue.
The way law enforcement uses informants sickens me. The die hard criminals
get a get out of jail free card. And people with integrity go to jail. Its
like George Orwell's 1984 you can't trust anyone because they are all
snitches. People that get someone else in trouble to get themselves out of
trouble are the scum of the earth.As for the bill of rights...ha ha..a thing
of the past.They got ways to get around everyone of your supposed rights.
Aren't you supposed to feel safe and secure in your home?All they need to do
is say one snitch said you were doing something illegal and they can smash
your doors down and run in with assault rifles.They don't have to reveal the
identity of their informants.So much for having the right to confront your
accuser. I don't know how things played out...but his resisting arrest
charge is an indication to me that Trout is a man of integrity and honor.
I'm just sorry he had to find out the hard way like myself that we have no
more rights and Big Brother can do as he pleases.
I better shut up before they set me up again..........
Does this make sense to you? Or do you think I'm another Stevie T?

hey stupid, i am steve t, i am the international intelligence director,
the primary owner of the US federal government.  i don't even smoke
cigarettes. i was first involved in federal investigations in 1994 when
louie freeh was the FBI director.

for implying that i am some how involved in your drug problem, that
constitutes as conspiracy against the government.  you will be put away
for 7 years in a federal pen.

pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org</a><br>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;{pb-cle} My situation<br>The only evidence they had on me was 2 confidential informants talkin shit.Then they took my garbage from the curb and found stuff.When they raided my house they didn&#39;t find 
shit.They took Benadryl (not even pseudo) and listed it as &quot;allergy medicine&#39;.What happened was this cunt that does cook meth came to my house on X-Mas eve cryin sayin she has nowhere to go so I let her stay at my house so she could see her 
kids.If it wasn&#39;t x-mas i woulda told her no get lost.Well like a week later I ended up finally throwin her ass out cuz I didn&#39;t want that shit in my house.It never even was
 made at my house.So after she left there was a garbage bag in the room she was using so i just threw it out to the curb.Well in the garbage was all kinds of shit enough evidence for meth lab. They were supposedly lookin for her on the search warrant. She never got 
arrested.Even my lawyer said she coulda been the CI.So she prolly set me up.......<br>&nbsp;<br>I did 9 months and 4 years paper and am now labeled a felon for letting a homeless person stay at my house on X-mas...<br>&nbsp;<br>What pissed me off the most is they smashed down my doors ran in with assault rifles,there was an armored vehicle in my front yard,hazmat,news cameras.....If I sold drugs I would expect something like 
that.I worked for a living.Why was this happening to me?I was furious i called them everyname in the book.Refused to cooperate with them that&#39;s why they banged me.I was charged with 3 felonies and 4 misdemeanors.I plead to one felony and one 
misdemeanor.I sold my house to pay for lawyer and
 PI.I lost everything I ever worked for.I&#39;m just glad its over<br><br>---<br><br>lol, sounds like layla.<br><br>she was a crack head that i let move in with me in ohio.&nbsp; she was<br>a nice girl when i first met her and had given her an engagement
<br>ring after 3 months.&nbsp; unfortunately, she slept around on me with:<br>gerrad martin, who was an illegal drug dealer. he got her messed<br>up on drugs, raped her and gave her his herpes. <br><br>sue the pharmaceutical company she got the pills from that she
<br>tried to set you up with.<br><br>if the pharmacutical company has a problem with being sued,<br>let them know you know the government agency that shot a<br>tomahawk missile into a pharmaceutical company for simply<br>

 since africa is<br>where 9/11 terrorists had come from.<br><br>btw, neither layla or mary cooked meth.&nbsp; that was gerrad martin<br>who was associated with those tares.&nbsp; meth wasn&#39;t as much as<br>a problem as when meth labs blew up and entire forests were
<br>set on fire.&nbsp; some mormon boys were tricked by dark tares to fire<br>attack some mexican houses with meth labs, unfortunately, meth<br>lab houses are extremely flamable and extremely&nbsp; explosive.&nbsp; the<br>subsequent explosion caused thousands of acres of cali wildfires,
<br>which caused some cali fire fighter deaths in california in 2003 to<br>2007.<br><br>that and because gerrad martin is wanted for 4 counts of involuntary<br>man slaughter is why there was a $500,000 federal bounty on gerrad
<br>martin.&nbsp; i reduced that federal bounty to $50,000 and re-allocated<br>$450,000 to california orange freeze victims.&nbsp; i have the power to do so,<br>because i am the primary owner of the US federal
 government.&nbsp; i have<br>federal executive power.<br><br>FEMA did cover victims expenses initially, but when it was<br>suspected additional fires were set for FEMA insurance scams,<br>than FEMA stopped compensating alleged victims.
<br><br>i don&#39;t know what happened to layla, but now i live in a big house<br>in the cali valley with a pool in the back in a predominantly republican<br>military neighborhood (security is so tight here a mex tried stealing
<br>my bike got nabbed and 9 other mexicans got shot for it in san diego<br>on labor day) after selling a half mill house in vegas with an 18 hole<br>golf course in the back that went to pay off the house i live in now<br>
(also worth about a half mill).&nbsp; the only problem i have is some dark<br>tares took my dad&#39;s cadi and he often takes the mercedes with my<br>name on the back of it when he goes on call since he&#39;s an old school<br>

<br>----<br><br>no. that is out of the question.<br><br>although i am seriously considering cutting federal financing to the DEA,<br>because federal funds are strapped and it costs tax payers money to keep<br>people in
 jail.&nbsp; i am actually for the legalization of marijuana and ecstacy,<br>so tax payers do not have to pay to keep them in jail.&nbsp; and space is needed<br>for much worse criminals like homicide and arsonists.<br><br>gov. schwarzenegger has complained several times concerning the jails
<br>being packed in california, expressed the need to send prisoners out of<br>state, and the need to build additional jails. both i veto&#39;ed as the primary<br>owner of the state government of california, because i felt california levee
<br>repair and valley hydro-electricity were much more important cali<br>development projects than any additional jails.<br><br>i want the record to show i never authorized this bust.&nbsp; the dems have<br>started some of their own agencies.&nbsp; for instance all of a sudden there is
<br>a fresno county sherrif department here in fresno, when it has always<br>previously been just fresno police department. as a result there are<br>all kinds of jurisdiction
 viiolation problems and financing problems.<br>they specialize in unauthorized meth busts, when they have not been<br>fully trained for it yet.&nbsp; they need K9 units, bullet proof vests, and<br>training methods of how to properly dispose of materials if indeed
<br>it is a meth lab since meth labs are explosive and can cause massive<br>forest fires if it is located in the woods.&nbsp; for instance, if an officer smokes<br>and enters a lab with flammable fumes, the whole place, the surrounding
<br>woods, and the officer blows up.&nbsp; the DEA is the agency that is supposed<br>to do drug busts, because the DEA has proper training and proper<br>equipment.&nbsp; sherrif department usually only handle rural areas<br>predominantly writing speeding tickets of people who speed through
<br>rural counties. <br><br>one meth lab they busted, didn&#39;t even look like a real meth lab, it<br>looked like a coors beer ball that some black gang member set up<br>to look like a meth lab to send
 them on a wild goose chase so the<br>dark tares can rob the other side of town, which they did on black<br>friday (the friday before x-mas).<br><br>fresno is no longer rural, it is definitly a city now, which the fresno police
<br>department handles.&nbsp; but recently due to budget problems the fresno<br>sheriff&#39;s department has been making jurisdiction violations and making<br>busts and arrests within city limits, this inadvertantly takes away city money. 
<br>so far the city has been nice about it because it knows county had been<br>suffering from some budget problems, but county&#39;s budget problem is now<br>beginining to cause a city budget problem.&nbsp; my solution was for county to
<br>do more fairs, in fact i will be delegating security for the oktoberfest here<br>in california to fresno county sherrif&#39;s department, where they may make<br>DUI arrests, but i also have a solution for that being mormon designated
<br>driver program.<br><br>fresno oktoberfest&#39;s security was
 previously handled by hells angels,<br>who also did the poker run last year (motorcycle parade followed by<br>a texas hold &#39;em poker tournament, but this year i think i&#39;m going to<br>add hell&#39;s angels to the undercover love fest staff since they are based
<br>in san francisco and fresno is 4 hours away from san francisco).&nbsp; previously<br>i had invited pope joseph ratzinger out to oktoberfest, but he hasn&#39;t been<br>able to make it out yet. here are the details to the oktoberfest in california...

i just sent a small amount over for now.  Hopefully you can get that over  
to Trout's canteen before the weekly order is in.  When you're inside,  
canteen is one of the only things to look forward to.

Thanks.

I don't know, I'm from (and in) NH.  I was inside in Mass; they called it  
both.

I didn't realize there was a political litmus test to enjoy Rave Music.   
Maybe you could send over the form where you sign a lifetime plea to  
support Joe Biden, his Rave Act, and Hillary's lesbocracy to be a "raver".


> please don't tell me you became born again in jail?
> thats what the pedophiles do


I have always followed Christ.  The time I spent inside had no effect on  
me and Christ's relationship.

let me guess you're the same idiot that accused child baptism as
child molestation and accused the german man of being a pedophile
for taking a pic w/ his daughter and her friends at the texas oktoberfest
before.

junglalien, i believe you are the equivalent of the old paparazzi
desperately digging for any dirt to tear down the next VIP, *YOU*
are the lowest form of humanity.

there are people much worse than those who touch their own
children, like real terrorists, the ones behind 9/11 or the california
wildfires, both of which were actually planned by your people.

you have the audacity.

you are indeed the lowest form of humanity.

your hate of israelites is proof that you are indeed an anti-christ.
let me guess, it is because God impregnanted the virgin mary
when she was 15, which you refer to as 'rape', because you are
such an anti-christ!

Just use a different email address... create a new gmail account if  you
have to. It's all done by email address and you can have as many accounts as
you want. I would just go and have it send the password to the email address
you tried.

No there are not.
 
Your bible is a piece of shit. Look at Genesis 19.Lot offers his 2 virgin  
daughters to the men of Sodom so they can gang rape them. Then Lot's daughter  
get him drunk and have sex with him. 
 
Then almost the same story is told again in chapter 19 of the book of  
judges. He gives them his daughter and a priest's concubine to rape They raped  the 
concubine so bad the priest found her dead on his doorstep in the morning.  So 
what does he do? He takes a knife and cuts her into 12 pieces and sends her  
to all the coasts of Israel.

Subject: {pb-cle} Trout Prelim Court Date

Looks like his court date is Wednesday at 11am and he has already
filed for and been assigned a public defender.  Anybody spoke to him?
Is the plan to try and get a legit attorney for him after his prelim
plea?  Enough time to do a benefit event all proceeds to Trout at The
Church maybe?

Hi. Trout has an additional charge of resisting arrest, and his bond was set at $100,000. My boyfriend also has a $100,000 bond because he was already on probation. The other guy, the one with the outstanding warrant, has a bond of $150,000. The girl and I are out on signature bonds because we had clean records.

They're all in Summit County. I'm taking Trout his glasses today, which my boss helped me find at the house when we were over there cleaning yesterday.

Hopefully, Trout's bond amount can be lowered at our hearing on Wednesday. He needs any monies donated for a lawyer, not his books. Thanks.

Good for you.  Not everybody is.

I'm keeping track of the threads, hence why I renamed it.  I could care  
less what your ISP is.

I just wanted to apologize for anything that I said. It is nothing against Trout. As Todd said emotions are running deep right now. Mine just ran a little too deep. I am just having a lot of trouble dealing with the fact that my daughter's father  may be put away for a long time. How do I tell a 7 year old that her father is in jail? It is a very sensitive subject and I am sorry I ever said a word about. I meant no disrespect. Cathy

I just wanted to apologize for anything that I said. It is nothing against Trout. As Todd said emotions are running deep right now. Mine just ran a little too deep. I am just having a lot of trouble dealing with the fact that my daughter's father&nbsp; may be put away for a long time. How do I tell a 7 year old that her father is in jail? It is a very sensitive subject and I am sorry I ever said a word about. I meant no disrespect. Cathy<br><p>&#32;

Next time your hubby calls collect let him know that if he ever gets out  
there will be no visitation unless supervised(not like he'll care anyway).
 
If this happened because of a confidential informant....I'd place bets on  
Cathy being the snitch.

First priority if he can't make bail is to get him money on his books. Like  
entropy said the only thing you have to look forward to in there is 
commissary.  You want his as comfortable as possible in there. The key to survival is to 
stop  him from stressin. Second priority should be to bail him out. You don't 
know how  frustrating and stressful it is when your only means of 
communication is collect  calls and snail mail. No one in there helps you out or tells 
you what to do. You  can't get anything accomplished with your case from inside. 
Then you should  start worrying about a lawyer. My initial thoughts were I 
need to spend as much  money on the best lawyer I can afford. I guess I figured 
I could buy my way out  of it.$27,000 later with one of the best lawyer's and 
private  investigators in the county. I still went to jail for something I 
didn't do.It  woulda been a lot worse if I didn't sell everything I owned to pay 
for  them.

Update on this - they are "closed" on Sundays. So my mom and I will drive his glasses over to him tomorrow before work. Poor guy has been next to blind since last Tuesday ... on top of the injuries he sustained from the SWAT guys ripping his ear off (50 stitches!) and fracturing his wrist. 

Note to all: Don't ever resist arrest. They will get you and hurt you and they will say it was your fault. These guys had machine guns and body armor. Trout was no match for them.

I think you should all stop with the personal attacks.  It's one thing
to discuss a situation, it's another to attack people...  One person
already apologized for this type of behavior.  No need to continue it.
 Take that shit off-list.

Yeah, short of bailing him out, getting money on his books is key.


> Second priority should be to bail him out.


I'm not sure where the whole case is right now legally, but mine went like  
this:


1) Raid on Friday...in holding all weekend with bond set at 10% of 1  
million dollars, or $100,000.
2) Arraignment on Monday, bail set to $10,000.  Sent to jail until bail  
was made.
3) Bail reduction hearing 7 days later, bail reduced to $3500, bailed out  
later that day.


Has the arraignment happened yet?

from http://www.jesuswalk.com/lessons/22_47-53.htm
Cutting Off the Servant's Ear (22:49-51a)

"When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, 'Lord,
should we strike with our swords?' And one of them struck the servant of the
high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus answered, 'No more of
this!' " (22:49-51a)

By now the disciples are awake, but are not thinking very clearly. They call
out, asking Jesus whether they should defend him with their swords, but
don't wait for an answer before they begin swinging their blades. "Sword"
(Greek *machaira*), here and in verse 52, refers to a relatively short sword
or dagger.[6] The phrase, "our swords," is a clear reference back to verse
38 where the disciples exclaim, "See, Lord, here are two swords." The terms
in verses 49 and 50 translated "strike, struck," or "smite, smote" indicate
the Greek verb *patasso*, "to physically strike a blow, 'strike, hit.' "[7]

The Apostle John supplies the name of the swordsman -- Peter -- as well as
the slave whose ear was sliced off, Malchus (John 18:10). John (who was
probably the "other disciple") "was known to the high priest" (John 18:15),
and may have known his servant also. It could be, however, that Malchus was
not just a menial slave. According to oriental usage, the term can be used
of a king's officials or "ministers" as in Matthew 18:23, 26-27. He was
probably the chief priest's official representative at the arrest, and
therefore was close by Judas, charged with making sure that Jesus was taken.

Courage and cowardice are often close to each other -- as we see in Peter.
Here in the Garden he is not a coward. He draws a sword and begins to whack
away, oblivious to the fact that several hundred armed troops are present to
see that Jesus' arrest takes place. You can call Peter stupid, a fool, and
spiritually dense, perhaps. But you can't call him a coward. Not tonight.
Not in the Garden.

But in his spiritual dullness, Peter doesn't perceive that Jesus' arrest and
crucifixion is God's will to redeem mankind. So, instead, he seeks to thwart
the arrest with his sword. Jesus rebukes him: "No more of this!" (22:51a).
In John's Gospel we read, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup
the Father has given me?" (John 18:11). Matthew adds, "for all who draw the
sword will die by the sword" (Matthew 26:52).

But Peter is not only spiritually dull about Jesus' destiny that is being
worked out in accordance with scripture, he is also dull about which of the
forces in the garden is in control. He sees an armed force of several
hundred men appear out of the darkness, but they are not the overwhelming
force. Matthew reports Jesus' words: "Do you think I cannot call on my
Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of
angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must
happen in this way?" (Matthew 26:53-54). Twelve legions comprise more than
12,000 troops -- of angels -- against a couple hundred temple guards. No
contest. Jesus is clearly spiritually prepared and in charge. He is not
taken against his will. He allows himself to be arrested in order to carry
out the Father's will.

So often we see our problems looming so large that we can't see how much
greater are God's resources to meet our need.
Jesus Heals the Wounded Man's Ear (22:51b)

"And he touched the man's ear and healed him." (22:51)

The word "touched" is Greek *hapto*, "to make close contact," often
indicating to touch with the hand to offer a blessing or to heal.[8]

You can't miss the contrast here. Peter strikes the servant with a sword to
injure him, but Jesus touches with his hand to heal (Greek *iaomai*). Jesus
is acting out his own teaching, "Love your enemies, do good to those who
hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you"
(6:27-28).

Malchus is the servant of Jesus' arch enemy, the chief priest, acting on
behalf of his master. But I wonder if Malchus is ever able to forget the
sensation of Jesus' hand on the side of his bloody face. One minute he feels
excruciating pain, the next, peace and wholeness. This emissary of the high
priest must do his duty and take his healer into custody, but how can he
ever be the same? Maybe that the reason John mentions his name is because
later he becomes a disciple and is known to the Christian community. We just
don't know.
Am I Leading a Rebellion? (22:52-53a)

"Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and
the elders, who had come for him, 'Am I leading a rebellion, that you have
come with swords and clubs? Every day I was with you in the temple courts,
and you did not lay a hand on me.' " (22:52-53a)

The phrase "leading a rebellion" (NIV) or "thief" (KJV) is the Greek noun *
lestes*. Originally the term referred to a "robber, highwayman, bandit" as
it does in 10:30, 36 and 19:46. But the term had been extended to include
"revolutionary, insurrectionist, guerrilla," which is probably the usage
here.[9] Jesus isn't a rebel whom they must arrest by stealth. He chides
them for coming armed with swords and clubs to arrest a peaceful man who has
made no attempt to hide from them.
When Darkness Reigns (22:53b)

"But this is your hour -- when darkness reigns." (22:53b)

The word translated "reigns" (NIV) or "power" (KJV) is the Greek noun *
exousia*, which refers to the right to control or command, "authority,
absolute power, warrant." But here, the authority of the chief priests to
arrest Jesus is characterized as the reign or power of darkness, the power
of the devil.

Jesus is making a play on words. He notes the irony of the situation. By
day, he has been teaching openly in the very temple that these soldiers have
been guarding, and yet they have not arrested him there in the full light of
day. Rather, they wait for the cover of darkness of night to cloak their
deeds, symbolizing the evil that motivates them.
Jesus Is Arrested (22:54a)

"Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high
priest" (22:54a)

The term "seizing" (NIV) or "took" (KJV) is Greek verb *sullambano*, "take
into custody, seize, grasp, apprehend, arrest someone."[10] Apparently there
is also an attempt to arrest Jesus' followers, for one (traditionally
thought of as Mark the Evangelist) is so frightened that he pulls away from
their grasp, leaves his garment in their hands, and streaks naked into the
night (Mark 14:51-52). Matthew records, "Then all the disciples deserted him
and fled" (Matthew 26:56b).
Loyalty and Betrayal

These few verses have many themes, but I'm selecting one for further comment
-- loyalty. Jesus expects his followers to be loyal. Any duplicity or act to
undermine the leader is an act of rebellion, an act of betrayal of trust and
friendship.

I have spent my entire life in the church, the last 25 years of that as a
senior pastor, and have talked to many of my pastor colleagues. We have seen
the ugliness of followers rebelling against and undermining leaders, while
speaking sweetly to their face. We have felt the pain and disappointment of
betrayal of our own trusted church leaders. As for me, in the process I have
second-guessed my own leadership -- and learned from my own mistakes. But, I
keep coming back to the fact that even the Perfect Leader is not immune to
betrayal.

Some of you who read this are pastors. Jesus knows he will be betrayed and
denied, but continues to draw his disciples close to him. In the end, one
loses hope, but one returns and is restored. Pastors, betrayal is part of
the devil's attack upon you to defeat you and cause you to lose hope and
faith, to become paranoid and cynical, and leave your post as a shepherd to
God's people. Jesus endured betrayal. So can you. So must you.

Some of you who read this are lay persons who are called to "obey your
leaders and submit to their authority" (Hebrews 13:17). Submission to
authority can be a stumbling block. If we haven't learned to submit to our
earthly mothers and fathers, it is difficult to submit to others in
authority -- including God. That streak of rebellion against authority that
began with the serpent in the Garden of Eden, continues on in fallen men and
women. Rebellion against Jesus' authority is one component of Judas'
betrayal.

Of course, parents and pastors are very human, and each of them has blind
sides and failings. You can choose to pick at your leaders as the
complaining Israelites picked at Moses. Or you can choose to hold up their
arms when the battle gets tough, as did Hur and Aaron for Moses (Exodus
17:12). There are times when you must speak clearly to your pastors things
they may not want to hear. That is not betrayal but friendship and loyalty.
Let your yes be yes and your no, no. But you must never become part of a
secret conspiracy against the shepherd that God has placed over you,
pretending to be a supporter, but secretly drawing away followers after
yourself (Acts 20:28-31). If you have been part of such a plot, repent of it
and ask God's forgiveness. We disciples must have nothing to do with the sin
of Judas, if we want God to bless our lives and ministries. Jesus calls his
disciples to be loyal to him and to one another.
Lessons for Disciples

There are a surprising number of discipleship lessons in this short passage
about Jesus' arrest:

   1. The pain of disloyalty and feigned friendship.
   2. The dangers of spiritual unpreparedness when facing crisis.
   3. Misguided courage by disciples who do not discern the will of God
   in a situation.
   4. Blindness to the power of God when the power of darkness seems so
   strong.
   5. The discipline of possessing great power but exercising restraint
   to obtain the greater goal.
   6. The appropriateness of rebuke for sin.
   7. The power of loving one's enemies and healing them, even in the
   face of betrayal and violence.

We disciples have a high calling. We have seen Jesus' in his hour of crisis,
and he shows us where we must grow to attain the full stature of our Master.
Grant it, Lord.

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">from <a href="http://www.jesuswalk.com/lessons/22_47-53.htm">http://www.jesuswalk.com/lessons/22_47-53.htm</a></span><br></h3><h3>Cutting Off the Servant&#39;s Ear (22:49-51a)</h3>
<blockquote>&quot;When Jesus&#39; followers saw what was going to happen, they
said, &#39;Lord, should we strike with our swords?&#39; And one of them struck
the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus
answered, &#39;No more of this!&#39; &quot; (22:49-51a)</blockquote>
<p>By now the disciples are awake, but are not thinking very clearly.
They call out, asking Jesus whether they should defend him with their
swords, but don&#39;t wait for an answer before they begin swinging their
blades. &quot;Sword&quot; (Greek <i>machaira</i>), here and in verse 52, refers
to a relatively short sword or dagger.[6] The phrase, &quot;our swords,&quot; is
a clear reference back to verse 38 where the disciples exclaim, &quot;See,
Lord, here are two swords.&quot; The terms in verses 49 and 50 translated
&quot;strike, struck,&quot; or &quot;smite, smote&quot; indicate the Greek verb <i>patasso</i>, &quot;to physically strike a blow, &#39;strike, hit.&#39; &quot;[7]</p>
<p>The Apostle John supplies the name of the swordsman -- Peter -- as
well as the slave whose ear was sliced off, Malchus (John 18:10). John
(who was probably the &quot;other disciple&quot;) &quot;was known to the high priest&quot;
(John 18:15), and may have known his servant also. It could be,
however, that Malchus was not just a menial slave. According to
oriental usage, the term can be used of a king&#39;s officials or
&quot;ministers&quot; as in Matthew 18:23, 26-27. He was probably the chief
priest&#39;s official representative at the arrest, and therefore was close
by Judas, charged with making sure that Jesus was taken.</p>
<p>Courage and cowardice are often close to each other -- as we see in
Peter. Here in the Garden he is not a coward. He draws a sword and
begins to whack away, oblivious to the fact that several hundred armed
troops are present to see that Jesus&#39; arrest takes place. You can call
Peter stupid, a fool, and spiritually dense, perhaps. But you can&#39;t
call him a coward. Not tonight. Not in the Garden.</p>
<p>But in his spiritual dullness, Peter doesn&#39;t perceive that Jesus&#39;
arrest and crucifixion is God&#39;s will to redeem mankind. So, instead, he
seeks to thwart the arrest with his sword. Jesus rebukes him: &quot;No more
of this!&quot; (22:51a). In John&#39;s Gospel we read, &quot;Put your sword away!
Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?&quot; (John 18:11).
Matthew adds, &quot;for all who draw the sword will die by the sword&quot;
(Matthew 26:52).</p>
<p>But Peter is not only spiritually dull about Jesus&#39; destiny that is
being worked out in accordance with scripture, he is also dull about
which of the forces in the garden is in control. He sees an armed force
of several hundred men appear out of the darkness, but they are not the
overwhelming force. Matthew reports Jesus&#39; words: &quot;Do you think I
cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more
than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be
fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?&quot; (Matthew 26:53-54).
Twelve legions comprise more than 12,000 troops -- of angels -- against
a couple hundred temple guards. No contest. Jesus is clearly
spiritually prepared and in charge. He is not taken against his will.
He allows himself to be arrested in order to carry out the Father&#39;s
will. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So often we see our problems looming so large that we can&#39;t see how much greater are God&#39;s resources to meet our need.</p>

<p>The word &quot;touched&quot; is Greek <i>hapto</i>, &quot;to make close contact,&quot; often indicating to touch with the hand to offer a blessing or to heal.[8] </p>
<p>You can&#39;t miss the contrast here. Peter strikes the servant with a
sword to injure him, but Jesus touches with his hand to heal (Greek <i>iaomai</i>).
Jesus is acting out his own teaching, &quot;Love your enemies, do good to
those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who
mistreat you&quot; (6:27-28).</p>
<p>Malchus is the servant of Jesus&#39; arch enemy, the chief priest,

i think jail / alcatraz (since alcatraz was dnb club in columbus, ohio
and was being planned as an DNB after party for love fest 2007)
 would be too nice for you.

7 years in the wilderness for you!

as the mary magdalene had to spend 7 years in the wilderness,
because she felt so guilty that jesus had to cast 7 devils out of her!

</a>)<br>&gt; ,<br>&gt; &gt; the percentage of&nbsp;&nbsp;people<br>&gt; &gt; reporting illicit drug use in their lifetimes rose from 31.3 percent in<br>&gt; &gt; 1979 to 35.8<br>&gt; &gt; percent in 1998. Between 1999 and 2001, the figure went from 
39.7&nbsp;&nbsp;to 41.1<br>&gt; &gt; (data prior to 1998 isn&#39;t comparable to data after 1998 due to changes&nbsp;&nbsp;in<br>&gt; &gt; methodology). The percentage of college students reporting having used<br>&gt; &gt; marijuana in<br>&gt; &gt; the last year went from 
27.9 percent in 1993 to 33.7 percent in&nbsp;&nbsp;2003; the<br>&gt; &gt; number using in the past month went from 14.2 percent to 19.3 percent;<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; number reporting daily use went from 1.9 percent to 
4.7 percent.<br>&gt; &gt; Interestingly, all of these increases have come from people over 18 years<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; age. Drug use among minors is significantly down. Which means that even as<br>&gt; &gt; adult&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans are more likely to take recreational drugs than they once
<br>&gt; &gt; were<br>&gt; &gt; (and&nbsp;&nbsp;given _these figures_<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; (<a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/05/16/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-guardrails/">http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/05/16/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-guardrails/
</a>)<br>&gt; &gt; , with little corresponding social harm),<br>&gt; &gt; they&#39;re doing a good job of steering their kids away from them.<br>&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, the government continues to arrest and incarcerate drug
<br>&gt; &gt; offenders, and in fact is now expanding its reach to include not just<br>&gt; &gt; recreational<br>&gt; &gt; users and traffickers, but _doctors_<br>&gt; &gt; (<a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3778">

I've been subbed to this list since 1999, when I was teaching 11th  grade.  A 
student subbed me, and I've been looking for her since she  graduated, she 
was cool as fuq (just to hang out with, I am female.)...I've long  since quit 
teaching of course.  I have never actually MET Trout, at least  that I know 
of...but I always mean to take my broken 12oo over to him for  repair.  So he is 
part of my life, he's part of a lot of people's lives in  a particular way... I 
can only donate a little bit of $ but hopefully loving  thoughts will reach 
him as well...         =)

I haven't even touched my computer in years. Well I just bought a new

remembered I used to have a girlfriend before I resubbed to this list. I've just 
 been having fun with my new toy.Soon it will loose its novelty and I will  
venture back into the real world and disappear from your precious  list.

I'm pretty much certain the 50+ messages today probably all consisted of
people bitching out others over not bitching out people.  I tried to at
least check the ones that were sent to me (my mail filters on the
{pb-cle} subject line so even direct replies don't show up where they
should).  So if you sent me something and didn't get a reply, I probably
inadvertently deleted it.

Do you think its going to break mine or Stevie T's heart if people un-sub  
from the list?
I could care less 
Look I didn't mean to be an asshole and I realized I have been blowing up  
people's mail boxes and its probally quite annoying....
 
I'll lay low if people keep me informed of Trout's situation.
Its just that I can sympathize with him and would like to  help.

I think Jess Leigh is right maybe we should get married. We have so much in  
common. We both suffer from similar psychosis. No one on the list can stand 
us.  We have no life other than to post messages to internet lists. I think we 
were  meant for each other. Maybe we can hold hands at Love Parade? If you 
treat me  right I can be your best friend on the street and your darkest tare in 
the  bedroom.

If you fly me out to fresno can I spend the night with you? We could rent  
Brokeback Mountain and cuddle in your bed. Then you can take me to Love Parade.  
Just so you know I love public displays of  affection.

i never authorised it.

i also never authorised the missile that was launched at
pakistan that killed 17 innocent people, because some
dark tares claimed 'al zarqwai' was there. the same
dark tares that accused a paki ice cream man was
al quida. the dark tare who turned out to be a former
crack head in detroit that was nowhere near pakistan.

that mistake was the obvious reason why pakistan blew
up an american consulate when bush gave his speech
in india.  when bush should never have been booked to
give a speech in india considering america had launched
a missile into pakistan killing 17 innocent people after
recieving BS reports from crack head dark tares.

just as america accepted a crack head dark tare report
that started the war on iraq alleging saddam attempted
to obtain yellow cake to enrich depleted uranium.

have you atleast explained to Jr. what is really going on
with the project blue book stuff, all the UFO's right after
the pre-emptive strike on baghdad with the tomahawk
missile yet?  because i sure don't feel like explaining
it.  it would take too long.

5 or so years there has been a witch hunt. I have seen dozens of cases
similar to the one here and I have know several people that have been
imprisoned. No one has ever taking a case like this to trial and won. The
last person I seen take it to trial got 25 years state. From the media
reports they have more than enough evidence to convict someone for
manufacture. I'm glad to see that they only received the one charge. Over
here they would have had 10-20 charges. A search warrant requires an
affidavit of probable cause. The evidence contained within is usually
enough to convict.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I knew someone over here that was raided and they found less than what
they took from them and when the Max of his charges was added up he was
looking at 115 years. They hit you with so many charges so you take a
plea to something less.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Another example: Someone was storing some glassware and hotplate at
another persons house.<br>
No chemicals or drug paraphernalia 2-4 years<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Another newer law requiring you to show I. D. to purchase pseudo
ephedrine.Feds went around to all the pharmacies got the logs.Seen where
one guy purchased 42 boxes within 2 days. (I know you got to be an idiot
to show your ID but when your spun you do stupid shit) He is now serving
7 years in federal prison. If the feds come for you there is no
hope.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On the average it seems to me that people raided for labs end up doing
2-4 years state. Federally 10-20 years. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
 From what the media said they confiscated from this raid there is an
overwhelming amount of evidence. I predict at least one person is doing a
minimum of 2 years. That's if other charges are brought up.If they just
get the one charge they could possibly get away with supervision.If they
gotta deal with public pretenders than they are screwed all the more. One
thing I noticed they confiscated vehicles. No one over here has ever had
vehicles or property seized for some reason. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I'd like to see the affidavit of probable cause for the search
warrant.Does anyone know if you can access that information online?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The reason no one beats it at trial is because all jury members know
about meth is what they see on the news. Basically its evil and you can
make it with stuff from the hardware store.The police show them some
allergy medicine a bottle of rubbing alcohol and say right here is the
evidence and they believe them. I suppose if you spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars&nbsp; on legal representation , private
investigators and hired chemist for expert witness. You could possibly
convince them your innocent. Another thing to consider...A lot of times
there are raids and busts with no media coverage. When there is media
coverage they are usually out to set an example, or possibly they are
content shutting down the operation,humiliating,exposing these people and
getting them out of the neighborhood.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have mixed feelings about the &quot;meth epidemic&quot; over here. I
would say stiff efforts of law enforcement have been successful in the
sense that a couple few years ago it seemed like everyone you met was
spun out of their mind including myself. One good thing jail did was get
me off that shit....however....who's to say I wouldn't have done it
myself. While I won't deny meth ruins lives...I have never heard of one
person dying from an overdose. And with the exaggerations of how
dangerous explosive and toxic meth labs are... I've never heard or seen a
meth lab explosion or seen anyone harmed by the &quot;toxic&quot;
byproducts. So why are they throwing everyone in jail? Because they want
to stay up all night? End punitive drug policies that cause the
widespread violation of constitutional and human rights, as well as
unprecedented levels of incarceration. I think drug abuse should be a
medical issue not criminal justice issue.<br>
The way law enforcement uses informants sickens me. The die hard
criminals get a get out of jail free card. And people with integrity go
to jail. Its like George Orwell's 1984 you can't trust anyone because
they are all snitches. People that get someone else in trouble to get
themselves out of trouble are the scum of the earth.As for the bill of
rights...ha ha..a thing of the past.They got ways to get around everyone
of your supposed rights. Aren't you supposed to feel safe and secure in
your home?All they need to do is say one snitch said you were doing
something illegal and they can smash your doors down and run in with
assault rifles.They don't have to reveal the identity of their
informants.So much for having the right to confront your accuser. I don't
know how things played out...but his resisting arrest charge is an
indication to me that Trout is a man of integrity and honor. I'm just
sorry he had to find out the hard way like myself that we have no more
rights and Big Brother can do as he pleases.<br>
I better shut up before they set me up again..........<br>
Does this make sense to you? Or do you think I'm another Stevie T?<br>

that's because you're easily amused, you twit!

seriously, guys need to come to california, see some real women.

get away from psycho crack head ho's who can ruin your lives.
you can work all your lives at the highest level of government,
acquire $1.4 trillion to bail america out of a trillion dollar defecit
from japanese and chinese investors in US treasury bonds, and
provide everybody working in america's pay check money, like i
had and one psycho crack head ho can ruin your life by just letting
them stay with you when they were homeless!

get away from fat chicks who have to resort to talking shit, because
they're jealous of the hotter younger women here.

seriously, bitter women have been tricking men to start unnecessary
wars since day one!  read the build up to WWI!  and other major
wars!  hell, it was eve that tricked adam to partake of the forbidden
fruit of knowledge.  as soon as eve whooped adam, everything
went to hell!

the serpent is the one tricking women to whoop men.  the holy
bible predicts a whore of babylon anti-christ.  obviously, if hillary's
main goal once she gets into the white house is to federally legalize
divorces to steal half a man's wealth and to federally legalize
universal healthcare to force everyone to have health insurance
so the government can legally rape you of your hard earned
savings after dem lawyers pretending to be doctors misdiagnose
you to be crazy for health insurance scams to acquire large amounts
of pills for black gang members to sell to your kids on the streets!

has anybody not noticed the largest snakes in the world are located
in africa?!...and the opra winfrey show is attributed as the number
one source for brainwashing women to whoop men to become
she-males?!

my mother was brainwashed by the opra winfrey show to believe i
was supposed to be a black gang member right before she assaulted
me and i had to go to the hospital for wrist x-rays.  but as soon as they
found out i had a government health insurance plan, they falsely
accused me of being a suicider to misdiagnose me to keep me in
for a month for a huge health insurance scam!

a crazy woman brainwashed by black gang members with jamaican
cannibis drove her car into the venue bush gave his speech at in
philadelphia. in iraq, cars driven into buildings, usually blow up as
suicide bombers!  al quida is just a nice way of saying african
terrorists, to appease condi (who, ironically has been traced to 8
assasination attempts on president bush).

if africa tricked bush into 2 wars against 2 nations that had nothing
to do with 9/11, when everybody and their mother knows that africans
were behind 9/11. and almost tricked us into additional wars with:
pakistan, iran, korea, mexico, japan, italy, china, russia, france,
germany, england, and greece, then it shouldn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out: africans are serpents!  mostly because most africans are
heathens that do not believe in jesus (which makes them anti-christ).
the ones that are religious are muslims, who believe in the prophet
muhammed and allah.  but american black muslims believe muhammed
is muhammed ali, who is worshipped because he was the first black man
that could beat up a white man, which black folk refer to as 'da man' or
'gettin da man'.  just as some dark tares refer to 9/11 as finally 'gettin
da
man' especially after black gang members put out gangster hip hop
albums showing the WTC getting blown up featuring the song "5 million
ways to kill a CEO"!

the black horse of injustice is prophesized in revelation.  but dark tares
think that as long as they can use reverse psychology and scream
"hate" and "KKK" and "nazi's" they think they can get away with
killing women, genocide on 9/11, and tricking america into 2 wars
against 2 nations that had nothing to do with 9/11, when dark tares
were behind 9/11, something they advertised on their black gangster
hip hop album they were going to do, right before 9/11!

the american justice system is supposed to provide justice for the
victims, and i dont mean katrina scam artists that have already raped
FEMA dry, but all the other victims due to black crimes and lies!
that black people have been desperately trying to cover up by
framing other minorities for their sins!

I'm 33 years old and my medication has caused me to go from wearing XL to XXL

unintentionally upsetting you. That you were so over takin by emotion that you misspelled

Trout's good friend. Sorry I reacted before I thought. I think its time to 
increase me meds.

I don't mean to be a pessimist but I've been in almost the exact same 
situation Trout is in. At first I thought I was going to sue the police and there was 
no way I was going to jail because I never manufactured or sold drugs. At 
sentencing I thought I was getting house arrest. Next thing I know I'm being hand 
cuffed in the court room and doing 9 months. And I seen it time and time 
again people don't realize how bad they are gonna get it and they are devasted whe
n it happens. If you hope for the best and plan for the worst. When you don't 
get the worst you will be happy instead of suicidal.

Uh, no, that would be communists, socialists, Marxists, and Islamics.

And you're not "sorry".  If you were you wouldn't say dumb shit like you  
did.

"Us Christians"?  hahaha

Christ is all-forgiving.  That doesn't mean I am.  I strive to forgive,  
but that doesn't mean I always do.

You have a serious misconception if you think Christians are a bunch of a  
dirty pacifist hippies.  I'm sure some are, but I'm not, and none that I  
know are.

You're not sorry anyway, so this conversation is irrelevant.

That's the last thing I think they are. I have respect for dirty pacifist

Christians have also been perpetrators of persecution against other religions 
 and other Christians. Christian mobs, sometimes with government support,  
destroyed _pagan_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism)  temples and 
persecuted or  even killed adherents of paganism (e.g. the philosopher _Hypatia of  
Alexandria_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia_of_Alexandria) ). Also, 
_Jewish_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish)  communities have  periodically 
suffered violence at Christian hands. Christian governments have  suppressed or 
persecuted groups seen as heretical, later in cooperation with the  _Inquisition_ 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition) . Denominational  strife escalated 
into _religious wars_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_wars) . _Witch  
hunts_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_hunts) , carried out by secular 
authorities or popular mobs, were a frequent  phenomenon in parts of _early 
modern Europe_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_Europe)   and, to a 
lesser degree, North America. Don't forget the Crusades.Look at  Ireland.

:
 for I do pass through
Macedonia<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd235.htm#003>
.
6 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may
bring me on my journey
<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd212.htm#001>whithersoever I

7 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with
you, if the Lord permit.
8 But I will tarry at
Ephesus<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd122.htm#007>until
Pentecost <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd289.htm#004>.
9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many
adversaries.
(19:55:37) *Stsang3169:* 10 Now if
Timotheus<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd367.htm#001>come, see
that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of
the Lord, as I also do.
11 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he
may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
12 As touching our brother
Apollos<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd026.htm#006>,
I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was
not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have
convenient time.
13 Watch ye, stand fast
<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd131.htm#004>in the faith, quit
you like men, be strong.
14 Let all your things be done with
charity<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd077.htm#009>
.
(19:55:47) *Stsang3169:* 15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of
Stephanas <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd351.htm#001>, that it is
the firstfruits of Achaia<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd006.htm#004>,
and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
16 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with
us, and laboureth.
17 I am glad of the coming of
Stephanas<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd351.htm#001>and
Fortunatus <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd137.htm#009> and
Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
18 For they have refreshed my
spirit<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd349.htm#009>and your's:
therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
(19:55:56) *Stsang3169:* 19 The churches of

you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
20 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy

*Ephesus* The capital of proconsular Asia, which was the western part of
Asia Minor. It was colonized principally from Athens. In the time of the
Romans it bore the title of "the first and greatest metropolis of Asia." It
was distinguished for the Temple of Diana (q.v.), who there had her chief
shrine; and for its theatre, which was the largest in the world, capable of
containing 50,000 spectators. It was, like all ancient theatres, open to the
sky. Here were exhibited the fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts.
(Compare Co1 4:9 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009>; Co1
9:24 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024>, Co1
9:25<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025>;
Co1 15:32 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032>.) Many Jews
took up their residence in this city, and here the seeds of the gospel were
sown immediately after Pentecost (Act
2:9<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act002.htm#009>;
Act 6:9 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act006.htm#009>). At the close
of his second missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was returning
from Greece to Syria (Act
18:18<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act018.htm#018>),
he first visited this city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as
he was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at Jerusalem; but
he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to carry on the work of spreading
the gospel. During his third missionary journey Paul reached Ephesus from
the "upper coasts" (Act
19:1<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act019.htm#001>),
i.e., from the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about three
years; and so successful and abundant were his labours that "all they which
dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks" (Act
19:10 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act019.htm#010>). Probably during
this period the seven churches of the Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul's
personal labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from
Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to their homes. On his
return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus, some 30 miles south of
Ephesus (Act 20:15 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act020.htm#015>),
and sending for the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he delivered to
them that touching farewell charge which is recorded in Acts 20:18-35.
Ephesus is not again mentioned till near the close of Paul's life, when he
writes to Timothy exhorting him to "abide still at Ephesus" (Ti1
1:3<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003>).
Two of Paul's companions, Trophimus and Tychicus, were probably natives of
Ephesus (Act 20:4 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act020.htm#004>; Act
21:29 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act021.htm#029>; Ti2
4:12<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012>).
In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul speaks of Onesiphorus as having
served him in many things at Ephesus (Ti2
1:18<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018>).
He also "sent Tychicus to Ephesus" (Ti2
4:12<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012>),
probably to attend to the interests of the church there. Ephesus is twice
mentioned in the Apocalypse (Rev
1:11<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011>;
Rev 2:1 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001>). The apostle
John, according to tradition, spent many years in Ephesus, where he died and
was buried. A part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied by a
small Turkish village, Ayasaluk, which is regarded as a corruption of the
two Greek words, hagios theologos ; i.e., "the holy divine."

*Pentecost* I.e., "fiftieth", found only in the New Testament (Act
2:1<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act002.htm#001>;
Act 20:16 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act020.htm#016>; Co1
16:8<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008>).
The festival so named is first spoken of in Exo
23:16<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016>as "the feast
of harvest," and again in Exo
34:22 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022> as "the day of
the firstfruits" (Num
28:26<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/num028.htm#026>).
>From the sixteenth of the month of Nisan (the second day of the Passover),
seven complete weeks, i.e., forty-nine days, were to be reckoned, and this
feast was held on the fiftieth day. The manner in which it was to be kept is
described in Lev 23:15 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015>;
Num 28:27 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/num028.htm#027>. Besides the
sacrifices prescribed for the occasion, every one was to bring to the Lord
his "tribute of a free-will offering" (Deu
16:9<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009>).
The purpose of this feast was to commemorate the completion of the grain
harvest. Its distinguishing feature was the offering of "two leavened
loaves" made from the new corn of the completed harvest, which, with two
lambs, were waved before the Lord as a thank offering. The day of Pentecost
is noted in the Christian Church as the day on which the Spirit descended
upon the apostles, and on which, under Peter's preaching, so many thousands
were converted in Jerusalem (Acts 2).
*Stephanas* Crown, a member of the church at Corinth, whose family were
among those the apostle had baptized (Co1
1:16<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/co1001.htm#016>;
Co1 16:15 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015>, Co1
16:17<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017>).
He has been supposed by some to have been the "jailer of Philippi" (compare Act
16:33 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act016.htm#033>). The First
Epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi some six years after
the jailer's conversion, and he was with the apostle there at that time.
*Stephen* One of the seven deacons, who became a preacher of the gospel. He
was the first Christian martyr. His personal character and history are
recorded in Act 6:1 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act006.htm#001>.
"He fell asleep" with a prayer for his persecutors on his lips (Act
7:60<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act007.htm#060>).
Devout men carried him to his grave (Act
8:2<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act008.htm#002>).
It was at the feet of the young Pharisee, Saul of Tarsus, that those who
stoned him laid their clothes (compare Deu
17:5<http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/deu017.htm#005>)
before they began their cruel work. The scene which Saul then witnessed and
the words he heard appear to have made a deep and lasting impression on his
mind (Act 22:19 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act022.htm#019>, Act
22:20 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act022.htm#020>). The speech of
Stephen before the Jewish ruler is the first apology for the universalism of
the gospel as a message to the Gentiles as well as the Jews. It is the
longest speech contained in the Acts, a place of prominence being given to
it as a defense.

</b></a> The capital of proconsular Asia, which was the western part of Asia Minor. It was colonized principally from Athens. In the time of the Romans it bore the title of &quot;the first and greatest metropolis of Asia.&quot; It was distinguished for the Temple of Diana (
q.v.), who there had her chief shrine; and for its theatre, which was the largest in the world, capable of containing 50,000 spectators. It was, like all ancient theatres, open to the sky. Here were exhibited the fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts. (Compare

Co1 15:32</a>.) Many Jews took up their residence in this city, and here the seeds of the gospel were sown immediately after Pentecost (<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act002.htm#009" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">
Act 2:9</a>; <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act006.htm#009" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Act 6:9</a>). At the close of his second missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was returning from Greece to Syria (
<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act018.htm#018" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Act 18:18</a>), he first visited this city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as he was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at Jerusalem; but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to carry on the work of spreading the gospel. During his third missionary journey Paul reached Ephesus from the
 &quot;upper coasts&quot; (<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act019.htm#001" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Act 19:1</a>), i.e., from the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about three years; and so successful and abundant were his labours that &quot;all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks&quot; (
<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act019.htm#010" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Act 19:10</a>). Probably during this period the seven churches of the Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul&#39;s personal labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to their homes. On his return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus, some 30 miles south of Ephesus (
<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act020.htm#015" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Act 20:15</a>), and sending for the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he delivered to them that touching farewell charge which is recorded in Acts 20:18-35. Ephesus is not again mentioned till near the close
 of Paul&#39;s life, when he writes to Timothy exhorting him to &quot;abide still at Ephesus&quot; (<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">
Ti1 1:3</a>). Two of Paul&#39;s companions, Trophimus and Tychicus, were probably natives of Ephesus (<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/act020.htm#004" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">

Ti2 4:12</a>). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul speaks of Onesiphorus as having served him in many things at Ephesus (<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">

Rev 2:1</a>). The apostle John, according to tradition, spent many years in Ephesus, where he died and was buried. A part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied by a small Turkish village, Ayasaluk, which is regarded as a corruption of the two Greek words, hagios theologos ;

Num 28:26</a>). From the sixteenth of the month of Nisan (the second day of the Passover), seven complete weeks, i.e., forty-nine days, were to be reckoned, and this feast was held on the fiftieth day. The manner in which it was to be kept is described in

Deu 16:9</a>). The purpose of this feast was to commemorate the completion of the grain harvest. Its distinguishing feature was the offering of &quot;two leavened loaves&quot; made from the new corn of the completed harvest, which, with two lambs, were waved before the Lord as a thank offering. The day of Pentecost is noted in the Christian
 Church as the day on which the Spirit descended upon the apostles, and on which, under Peter&#39;s preaching, so many thousands were converted in Jerusalem (Acts 2).</font><font size="2"><font><font face="Arial"><br></font>

i dont have to pay for cost of living. sold half mill house in vegas w/ 18
hole golf course to pay off half mill house i live in now w/ pool in the
back.
no earthquakes the whole time i've been here. mother nature loves me.
only problem is mormon morons tricked by dark tares to hate mexicans
to burn their houses down a few times in southern cali, but that's 4 hours
south.

i never had a drug problem like you did, so i can't relate at all to all
your
problems. i went to a prep school, an ivy league university, worked at
MBNA when louie freeh was an exec there and FBI director, was a part
of the pre Y2K intelligence team for the state of ohio in 1998, last job
in ohio was a fed gov job getting people jobs in gov, military, fortune 500,
and healthcare. that job like almost all jobs i had, one cant get unless
pass a drug test & 2 interviews. relocated to cali at end of 2002. started
west coast homeland security in 2003. made a mission to japan and china
to restart a $500 billion world trade deal between america and asia that
got stalled due to idiots faslely accusing asians of opium to justify
stealing
imported japanese cars when in reality asians regard opium as jews regard
swastikas ever since the emperor hacked heads to get opium out of china
back in the day. china just stopped executing illegal drug dealers less than
20 years ago. was able to make america $1.4 trillion from japanese and
chinese investors in US treasury bonds to bail america out of a trillion
dollar fed defecit caused by war mongering dark tares. 2004 started love
parade SF as anniversary party for UN. 2005 promoted for 100 NYE events
from NYC to Vegas to LA, but end up web casting a 15,000 person event
in germany after finalizing a $2 billion mono-rail deal to finance world
cup stadiums in germany. 2006 also promoted for 100 NYE events from
NYC to Vegas to LA, but end up initiating video security that broadcasted
the NY Times Square Ball Drop.  2006 started Love Fest 2006 out by
partaking in burnt offering covenant with my father in chinatown, SF right
before Love Fest 2006.  this year helping promo Love Fest 2007 as well
as Oktoberfest 2007 in Cali Valley. I have promoted for over 1000 events
from 1984 now from Ohio to NYC to Vegas to LA and SF.

Revelation 2
[*20*] Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee,
because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel,
which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce
my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.
[*21*] And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented
not.

seriously, guys need to come to california, see some real women.

get away from psycho crack head ho's who can ruin your lives.
you can work all your lives at the highest level of government,
acquire $1.4 trillion to bail america out of a trillion dollar defecit
from japanese and chinese investors in US treasury bonds, and
provide everybody working in america's pay check money, like i
had and one psycho crack head ho can ruin your life by just letting
them stay with you when they were homeless!

get away from fat chicks who have to resort to talking shit, because
they're jealous of the hotter younger women here, by calling guys
pedophiles!

seriously, bitter women have been tricking men to start unnecessary
wars since day one!  read the build up to WWI!  and other major
wars!  hell, it was eve that tricked adam to partake of the forbidden
fruit of knowledge.  as soon as eve whooped adam, everything
went to hell!

the serpent is the one tricking women to whoop men.  the holy
bible predicts a whore of babylon anti-christ.  obviously, if hillary's
main goal once she gets into the white house is to federally legalize
stealing half a man's wealth by divorce and to federally legalize
universal healthcare to force everyone to have health insurance
so the government can legally rape you of your hard earned
savings after dem lawyers pretending to be doctors misdiagnose
you to be crazy for health insurance scams to acquire large amounts
of pills for black gang members to sell to your kids on the streets!

has anybody not noticed the largest snakes in the world are located
in africa?!...and the opra winfrey show is attributed as the number
one source for brainwashing women to whoop men to become
she-males?!

my mother was brainwashed by the opra winfrey show to believe i
was supposed to be a black gang member right before she assaulted
me and i had to go to the hospital for wrist x-rays.  but as soon as they
found out i had a government health insurance plan, they falsely
accused me of being a suicider to misdiagnose me to keep me in
for a month for a huge health insurance scam!

a crazy woman brainwashed by black gang members with jamaican
cannibis drove her car into the venue bush gave his speech at in
philadelphia. in iraq, cars driven into buildings, usually blow up as
suicide bombers!  al quida is just a nice way of saying african
terrorists, to appease condi (who, ironically has been traced to 8
assasination attempts on president bush).

if africa tricked bush into 2 wars against 2 nations that had nothing
to do with 9/11, when everybody and their mother knows that africans
were behind 9/11. and almost tricked us into additional wars with:
pakistan, iran, korea, mexico, japan, italy, china, russia, france,
germany, england, and greece, then it shouldn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out: africans are serpents!  mostly because most africans are
heathens that do not believe in jesus (which makes them anti-christ).
the ones that are religious are muslims, who believe in the prophet
muhammed and allah.  but american black muslims believe muhammed
is muhammed ali, who is worshipped because he was the first black man
that could beat up a white man, which black folk refer to as 'da man' or
'gettin da man'.  just as some dark tares refer to 9/11 as finally 'gettin
da
man' especially after black gang members put out gangster hip hop
albums showing the WTC getting blown up featuring the song "5 million
ways to kill a CEO"!

the black horse of injustice is prophesized in revelation.  but dark tares
think that as long as they can use reverse psychology and scream
"hate" and "KKK" and "nazi's" they think they can get away with
killing women, genocide on 9/11, and tricking america into 2 wars
against 2 nations that had nothing to do with 9/11, when dark tares
were behind 9/11, something they advertised on their black gangster
hip hop album they were going to do, right before 9/11!

the american justice system is supposed to provide justice for the
victims, and i dont mean katrina scam artists that have already raped
FEMA dry, but all the other victims due to black crimes and lies!
that black people have been desperately trying to cover up by
framing other minorities for their sins!

<br>universal healthcare to force everyone to have health insurance<br>so the government can legally rape you of your hard earned<br>savings after dem lawyers pretending to be doctors misdiagnose <br>you to be crazy for health insurance scams to acquire

<br>found out i had a government health insurance plan, they falsely <br>accused me of being a suicider to misdiagnose me to keep me in<br>for a month for a huge health insurance scam! <br><br>a crazy woman brainwashed by black gang members with jamaican
<br>cannibis drove her car into the venue bush gave his speech at in<br>philadelphia. in iraq, cars driven into buildings, usually blow up as<br>suicide bombers!&nbsp; al quida is just a nice way of
 saying african  <br>terrorists, to appease condi (who, ironically has been traced to 8<br>assasination attempts on president bush).<br><br>if africa tricked bush into 2 wars against 2 nations that had nothing<br>to do with 9/11, when everybody and their mother knows that africans 
<br>were behind 9/11. and almost tricked us into additional wars with:<br>pakistan, iran, korea, mexico, japan, italy, china, russia, france, <br>germany, england, and greece, then it shouldn&#39;t take a rocket scientist  
<br>to figure out: africans are serpents!&nbsp; mostly because most africans are <br>heathens that do not believe in jesus (which makes them anti-christ).<br>the ones that are religious are muslims, who believe in the prophet  
<br>muhammed and allah.&nbsp; but american black muslims believe muhammed <br>is muhammed ali, who is worshipped because he was the first black man <br>that could beat up a white man, which black folk refer to as &#39;da man&#39; or  
<br>&#39;gettin da man&#39;.&nbsp; just as
 some dark tares refer to 9/11 as finally &#39;gettin da <br>man&#39; especially after black gang members put out gangster hip hop <br>albums showing the WTC getting blown up featuring the song &quot;5 million  <br>ways to kill a CEO&quot;!
<br><br>the black horse of injustice is prophesized in revelation.&nbsp; but dark tares<br>think that as long as they can use reverse psychology and scream<br>&quot;hate&quot; and &quot;KKK&quot; and &quot;nazi&#39;s&quot; they think they can get away with  
<br>killing women, genocide on 9/11, and tricking america into 2 wars<br>against 2 nations that had nothing to do with 9/11, when dark tares<br>were behind 9/11, something they advertised on their black gangster<br>hip hop album they were going to do, right before 9/11! 
<br><br>the american justice system is supposed to provide justice for the <br>victims, and i dont mean katrina scam artists that have already raped<br>FEMA dry, but all the other victims due to black crimes and lies!<br>

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Buzz is back

Celebration time, indeed.

The club they're going into, Fur, was formerly very, very dress to
impress.  They've cancelled any dress-code type things for the next
two months, and encouraged people to dress as amusingly as possible.
However, the club still has pricey drinks (--) and a coffee bar (++).

It'll be interesting to see how the space works out?  I'll report back
on monday.  :-)

Acquaviva and Seb Fontaine. :)

hillary comes off as the women accustomed to a platinum visa card with
unlimited

health care

she is obviously completely out of touch when it comes to the federal budge=

problem.

read her ridiculous universal health care plan, then read mine that i poste=

last
month that is like 500 times better.  i can't believe her initial plan was
1300 pages
long.  and was so complicated that even doctors knew it was corrupt and
voted
against it.  dem healthcare plans have always been about raping the federal
reserve of funds, raping us citizens of hard earned savings, and targeting
GOP
and other rich for scams as proven in the hsu the rich asian investor case,
as
soon as dems found out he was rich from the amount of money he accumulated
for dems, they took advantage of him and made him look like a criminal when
in reality he was a victim of dem identity theft scam. no wonder, dick

Clinton to offer health care plan

By BETH FOUHY, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 11 minutes ago

DES MOINES, Iowa - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
is unveiling a sweeping health care reform proposal Monday that would
require every American to carry health insurance and offer federal subsidie=
s
to help reduce the cost of coverage.
ADVERTISEMENT


With a price tag of about $110 billion per year, Clinton's "American Health
Choices Plan" represents her first major effort to achieve universal health
coverage since 1994, when the plan she authored during her husband's first
term collapsed.

The former first lady says she has learned from that experience, which
almost derailed Bill Clinton's presidency and helped put Republicans in
control of Congress for years to come. Aides say she has jettisoned the
complexity and uncertainty of the last effort in favor of a plan that
stresses simplicity, cost control and consumer choice.

The centerpiece of Clinton's plan is the so-called "individual mandate,"
requiring everyone to have health insurance =97 just as most states require
drivers to purchase auto insurance. Rival John Edwards has also offered a
plan that includes an individual mandate, while the proposal outlined by
Barack Obama does not.

"It puts the consumer in the driver's seat by offering more choices and
lowering costs," Neera Tanden, Clinton's top policy adviser, told The
Associated Press. "If you like the plan you have, you keep it. If you're on=
e
of tens of millions of Americans without coverage or don't like the coverag=
e
you have, you will have a choice of plans to pick from and you'll get tax
credits to help pay for it."

Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, has already laid out proposals to
improve health care quality and reduce costs. She was to release her
universal health care plan in Iowa, the first voting state.

With 47 million Americans currently uninsured, the Democratic presidential
contenders have been united in advocating universal coverage. They have
parted ways on certain specifics, including the individual mandate, which
has detractors from both ends of the political spectrum.

Republican skeptics say it would be too invasive and would restrict persona=
l
freedom and choice. Liberal Democrats have expressed concern that such a
mandate would be too financially budensome for lower-income individuals and
families =97 a concern shared by Obama, who has said individuals cannot be
forced to purchase insurance until the cost of coverage is substantially
reduced.

Aides said Clinton believes that an individual mandate is the only way to
achieve health care for all. A key component of her plan would be a federal
tax subsidy to help individuals pay for coverage.

Clinton's plan builds on the existing employer-based system of coverage.
People who receive insurance through the workplace could continue to do so;
businesses, in turn, would be required to offer insurance to employees, or
contribute to a government-run pool that would help pay for those not
covered. Clinton would also offer a tax subsidy to small businesses to help
them afford the cost of providing coverage to their workers.

For individuals and families who are not covered by employers or whose
employer-based coverage is inadequate, Clinton would offer expanded version=
s
of two existing government programs: Medicare, and the health insurance pla=
n
currently offered to federal employees. Consumers could choose between
either government-run program, but aides stress that no new federal
bureaucracy would be created under the Clinton plan.

Aides said Clinton will propose several specific measures to pay for her
plan, including an end to some of the Bush-era tax cuts for people making
more than $250,000 per year. Edwards has vowed to completely repeal the tax
cuts for high earners to pay for the cost of his plan, estimated at $90
billion-$120 billion per year, while Obama would pay for his plan in part b=
y
letting the tax cuts expire in 2010.

Clinton is also expected to stress several cost-saving measures to help pay
for universal coverage. She's already recommended several such proposals,
such computerized medical record-keeping and a reduction in federal
overpayments to hospitals and health maintenance organizations. She would
also promote wellness and disease prevention as a way to reduce costs.

Clinton is sure to court danger from the health insurance industry by
proposing several industry reforms. Among other things, she would require
insurance companies to provide coverage to all consumers regardless of
pre-existing conditions.

The insurance industry helped kill Clinton's earlier attempt at health care
reform through a multibillion-dollar media and lobbying campaign.

While Clinton is expected to lay out a concrete vision for health care
reform, she will probably steer clear of delving too deeply into policy
specifics, at least for now.

Her 1994 effort was 1,300 pages long and so detailed it offered little room
for any maneuvering or compromise. And after seven years in the Senate,
Clinton has said she's developed a greater appreciation of the need to
compromise.

here is my solution that i had posted last month that is 500 times better
than the

hillary clinton universal health scam plan...

in lieu of those still suffering health problems after 9/11, katrina,
california wildfires, west nile virus, "friendly fire" dark tare drive-by
shootings,  iraq and
 afghanistan injured soldiers, pregnant moms,
and other americans who need health coverage, here is my federal
executive decision as the primary owner of the US federal government...

previous federal law is that american workers may not use social
security, medicare, medical savings until retirement at 65.  i am going
to change that you no longer have to be 65 to access those savings.
here is the universal health care system that i am proposing:

first off, it is an optional plan, you do not have to be a part of it if yo=
u
do not think you can afford it.  the payments will be taken out of your
medicare / medical savings or social security savings if and only if
you sign up for it.  medical credit card with 3 health care plans:

1. single plan - $10/month - gives you 25% off prescription meds.,
    25% off medical treatment services, 25% off hospital stay.
2. family plan - $20/month - gives you 50% off prescription meds,

 50% off medical treatment services, 50% off hospital stay.
3. VIP plan - $50/month - gives you 75% off presciption meds,
    75% off medical treatment services, 75% off hospital stay.

payment may be taken out of your medicare / medical savings, but only
if you sign for it.  it must be an ink signature not digital to prevent
double chargings.  patient has the right to refuse treatment, if doctor tri=
es to
force treatment when patient does not want treatment, than doctor may
be arrested and made to pay $1000 fine.

program to be federally monitored to prevent patient abuse and prevent
unnecessary treatment, over-charging, double charging, excess med
orders, and prevent FDA banned drugs that have been proven to cause
death to some patients.  patient will always have right to refuse pills
that cause patient discomfort.  if patient is forced meds, then patient
may call the police to arrest the abusive medical staff and
 abusive
medical staff person will have to pay $1000 fine to get out of jail.

all doctors must be board certified doctors with degrees in medicine,
no fake doctors or lawyers pretending to be doctors to scam patients.
all patients are entitled to a second opinion.  if patient feel they are
being misdiagnosed, they may seek a second opinion or refuse
treatment completely, if doctor attempts to force treatment or treats
the patient as if he is mentally incapable to make such a decision,
then the patient has the right to sue the doctor for defamation of
character, slander, and loss of wages.  this means m. geisbrecht
owes me $500,000 for mis-diagnosing me, forcing treatment, and
pushing pills on me that has proven to kill 1/3 of old patients, if he
does not start making payments to me in one month, he may be
arrested and will not be able to leave jail until he comes up with a
payment plan to me.

</a><br><br>Clinton to offer health care plan<br><br>By BETH FOUHY, Associa=
ted Press Writer 2 hours, 11 minutes ago<br><br>DES MOINES,
 Iowa - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton is unveili=
ng a sweeping health care reform proposal Monday that would require every A=
merican to carry health insurance and offer federal subsidies to help reduc=
e the cost of coverage.
<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br>&nbsp;<br><br>With a price tag of about $110 billion p=
er year, Clinton&#39;s &quot;American Health Choices Plan&quot; represents =
her first major effort to achieve universal health coverage since 1994, whe=
n the plan she authored during her husband&#39;s first term collapsed.
<br><br>The former first lady says she has learned from that experience, wh=
ich almost derailed Bill Clinton&#39;s presidency and helped put Republican=
s in control of Congress for years to come. Aides say she has jettisoned th=
e complexity and uncertainty of the last effort in favor of a plan that str=
esses simplicity, cost control and consumer choice.
<br><br>The centerpiece of Clinton&#39;s plan is the so-called &quot;indivi=
dual mandate,&quot; requiring everyone to have health
 insurance =97 just as most states require drivers to purchase auto insuran=
ce. Rival John Edwards has also offered a plan that includes an individual =
mandate, while the proposal outlined by Barack Obama does not.<br><br>&quot=
;It puts the consumer in the driver&#39;s seat by offering more choices and=
 lowering costs,&quot; Neera Tanden, Clinton&#39;s top policy adviser, told=
 The Associated Press. &quot;If you like the plan you have, you keep it. If=
 you&#39;re one of tens of millions of Americans without coverage or don&#3=
9;t like the coverage you have, you will have a choice of plans to pick fro=
m and you&#39;ll get tax credits to help pay for it.&quot;
<br><br>Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, has already laid out proposals=
 to improve health care quality and reduce costs. She was to release her un=
iversal health care plan in Iowa, the first voting state.<br><br>With 47 mi=
llion Americans currently uninsured, the Democratic presidential contenders=
 have been united in advocating universal coverage. They have parted
 ways on certain specifics, including the individual mandate, which has det=
ractors from both ends of the political spectrum.<br><br>Republican skeptic=
s say it would be too invasive and would restrict personal freedom and choi=
ce. Liberal Democrats have expressed concern that such a mandate would be t=
oo financially budensome for lower-income individuals and families =97 a co=
ncern shared by Obama, who has said individuals cannot be forced to purchas=
e insurance until the cost of coverage is substantially reduced.
<br><br>Aides said Clinton believes that an individual mandate is the only =
way to achieve health care for all. A key component of her plan would be a =
federal tax subsidy to help individuals pay for coverage.<br><br>Clinton&#3=
9;s plan builds on the existing employer-based system of coverage. People w=
ho receive insurance through the workplace could continue to do so; busines=
ses, in turn, would be required to offer insurance to employees, or contrib=
ute to a government-run pool
 that would help pay for those not covered. Clinton would also offer a tax =
subsidy to small businesses to help them afford the cost of providing cover=
age to their workers.<br><br>For individuals and families who are not cover=
ed by employers or whose employer-based coverage is inadequate, Clinton wou=
ld offer expanded versions of two existing government programs: Medicare, a=
nd the health insurance plan currently offered to federal employees. Consum=
ers could choose between either government-run program, but aides stress th=
at no new federal bureaucracy would be created under the Clinton plan.
<br><br>Aides said Clinton will propose several specific measures to pay fo=
r her plan, including an end to some of the Bush-era tax cuts for people ma=
king more than $250,000 per year. Edwards has vowed to completely repeal th=
e tax cuts for high earners to pay for the cost of his plan, estimated at $=
90 billion-$120 billion per year, while Obama would pay for his plan in par=
t by letting the
 tax cuts expire in 2010.<br><br>Clinton is also expected to stress several=
 cost-saving measures to help pay for universal coverage. She&#39;s already=
 recommended several such proposals, such computerized medical record-keepi=
ng and a reduction in federal overpayments to hospitals and health maintena=
nce organizations. She would also promote wellness and disease prevention a=
s a way to reduce costs.
<br><br>Clinton is sure to court danger from the health insurance industry =
by proposing several industry reforms. Among other things, she would requir=
e insurance companies to provide coverage to all consumers regardless of pr=
e-existing conditions.
<br><br>The insurance industry helped kill Clinton&#39;s earlier attempt at=
 health care reform through a multibillion-dollar media and lobbying campai=
gn.<br><br>While Clinton is expected to lay out a concrete vision for healt=
h care reform, she will probably steer clear of delving too deeply into pol=
icy specifics, at least for now.
<br><br>Her 1994
 effort was 1,300 pages long and so detailed it offered little room for any=
 maneuvering or compromise. And after seven years in the Senate, Clinton ha=
s said she&#39;s developed a greater appreciation of the need to compromise=

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

respected DJs and producers. Recognized for his membership in the gold 
selling group Jurassic 5, Nu-Mark is best known for his production on 
the raw anthem .What.s Golden. and the smooth and soulful .Work It Out,.

creative on-stage antics have made him a favorite of crowds all over the 
world.

the globe several times over, and have made numerous television 
appearances. With Jurassic 5, Nu-Mark has performed at many of the 
world.s most important and exciting music festivals . Coachella, 
Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza 2003, Australia.s Big Day Out, The UK.s Reading 
Festival, and Japan.s Summer Sonic . where his mastery of a complex, 
six-piece DJ rig and his playful incorporation of children.s musical 
toys have amazed and delighted crowds of up to 50,000 fans. Jurassic 5 
has appeared alongside many of music.s greats, including A Tribe Called 
Quest, the Wu-Tang Clan, Outkast, The Roots, Run DMC, Green Day, and 
even Bruce Springsteen.

Nu-Mark is responsible for half of the production of Jurassic 5.s entire 
body of work: Jurassic 5 EP (1997), Quality Control (2000), Power In 
Numbers (2002), and Feedback (2006). He has also released his own 
projects, independent of the group: Blend Crafters, an instrumental 
album created in the spirit of allowing beats to speak for themselves, 
and Hands On, a mix-CD. Hands On assembles a diverse and eclectic set of 
sounds, everything from soulful breaks to comedic skits, as well as 
classic underground jams, and includes a special section devoted to 
hip-hop from around the world. By turns hilarious and impressive, this 
project displays both Nu-Mark.s eccentric sense of humor and his 
devotion to solid, simply dope music. Currently, Nu-Mark is placing his 
beats on a number of projects in a variety of genres.

Nu-Mark began DJing as a teenager in Los Angeles. Over the course of the 
last two decades, he has amassed a collection of over 35,000 records and 
refined his technical skills and performance style to the point where he 
is widely recognized as one of the key figures in the late-90s DJ 
explosion which pushed the DJ to the front of the culture.s awareness. 
As a result of this distinction, Nu-Mark has been featured in a 
diversity of publications and in several films: the critically acclaimed 
documentary .Scratch,. .KeepinTime. (which features impromptu 
collaborations with Mad Lib, Cut-Chemist, Babu, J-Rocc, and drummers 
James Gatson and Paul Humphrey), .Coachella: The Movie,. and .Rock the 
Bells . The Documentary..

Today, Nu-Mark is well-known for his innovative plays on sound . 
attaching a rubber band to his turntable.s needle and playing it like an 
upright bass or tapping on the turntable.s dust cover to simulate a bass 
drum. Incorporating a wide range of musical styles . soul, funk, 
hip-hop, and samba effortlessly blended together . Nu-Mark revels in 
surprising an audience with a forgotten gem, an unknown banger, or a 
fresh take on a well-known hit. From Sao Paolo to Sydney, from Toronto 
to Tokyo, Nu-Mark.s carefully crafted, explosively energetic DJ sets 
never fail to get a party rocking.

Hill Records act Mean Machine and hip hop impresario Grandmaster Flash, 
Raida cultivated his interest into an absolute passion. Now, Roc Raida

the underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.
In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who, for obvious of copyright reasons, later 
became known as the X-ecutioners. Champions of furthering the 
turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made their reputation by 
utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the manual alteration between 
individual kick and snare sounds to create original drum patterns in 
real time. This practice has been an inspiration and a force in Roc 
Raida.s style.
In the beginning defeat was commonplace, as battles were mainly 
popularity contests. The more contests he entered the more the 
competition began to appreciate his style and determination. Pushing his 
limits and raising the standard with which DMC.s are judged, Raida began 
to get noticed. His impressive finishes in some of the premier DJ 
battles; first place in the 1991 "As One"; second place in the "Superman 
Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC US Finals were just the 
beginning. In 1995 Raida, was crowned the DMC World Champion in front of 
a massive London audience.
The past several years have seen Raida traveling around the globe 
promoting the art of Turntablism in such exotic locations as Singapore, 
Turkey, Japan and Australia. Last year on a panel at the Rock-n-Roll 
Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of 
Hip-Hop.s founding fathers. Rules for this dubious honor state that one 
may only be bestowed with the approval of another Grandmaster, Raida was 
not only approved, but welcomed by Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore and 
scratch evolutionist DST. To round out a phenomenal decade, Raida was 
inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the 1999 DMC World Finals in New 
York City.
Roc Raida was recently featured on an episode of "Saturday Night Live"; 
the first DJ to ever share the stage with the fabled SNL band. Proving, 
once again, that Raida is the perfect example of a master perfecting his 
art.
Turntablism has come up through the rave culture and is now showcased at 
every Electronic Music happening with crews such as The X-Ecutioners, 
Invisbl Skratch Piklz, Allies and Beat Junkies headlining events 
worldwide. Now with the success of the X-Ecutioners record .Built from 
Scratch. and .Revolutions. Raida has taken a step forward to work on his 
first solo effort .Raida.s Talent Search. which will be a CD and DVD 
combined showing Raida.s production and turntablists efforts as well as 
his comedy sketches throughout the DVD. Raida is also currently working 
on his autobiography of his life. Look out! As it is time for 
Grandmaster Roc Raida to take the world by storm once again.

Thu Sep 27                         KASKADE                         Columbus

www.kaskademusic.com
View e-flyer and sample CD at: www.ultrarecords.com/ECards/Kaskade
Bring the Night is the latest mix album by house DJ/producer Kaskade. 
Released on Ultra Records, Bring the Night is crafted to give unwavering 
house heads what they want most in a mix album: it delivers on the party 
front and drops the big room jams. And true to Kaskade styleand what 
differentiates this artist from others in dance musicBring the Night 
also manages to serve up those trademark melodies and sensual vocals.
But more than anything, this is 115 minutes of feel good body rock. 
"With my artist albums, I'm conveying emotion, I'm constructing beats 
and writing songs that represent me as an artist and a person, so it 
doesn't necessarily come out as 'dance heavy,'" says Kaskade. "But a mix 
CD is about walking the line, and fitting my style in with the DJ side 
of things. Yeah, I want to keep it musical and fresh, but Bring the 
Night is intentionally produced very rhythmic andwell, banging. This is 
a head bobbing mix, something to pop in your car and thump."
And with 15 hard-hitting tracks, including Dance Chart topping Kaskade 
remixes of Nelly Furtado's "All Good Things (Come To An End)", and 
Floetry's "SupaStar," Bring the Night achieves just thatit's a non-stop, 
seamless stream of orchestrated beats and flavor, all with a nod to the 
night life.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Subject: {pb-cle} IAVUMOTT

The limited edition pressing of my most recent album I Am Very
Uncomfortable Most Of The Time is almost sold out. If you have yet to
order one yet is the time to order one.  Probably under 50 copies
left.

You can order directly from
http://experimedia.net
or from my profile page at
http://myspace.com/jeremybible


Some reviews....

"Online music label Experimedia harks back to computing's glory days
of interleaving and sub-coded data with their first ever CD release:
an individually numbered, limited edition floppy disk-style package of
compositions from producer Jeremy Bible. One of the few recording
artists with a halfway interesting name, Bible isn't afraid to leave a
few sawtoothed edges and rough surfaces on what is otherwise a smooth
and translucent sound. This works well enough on the languorous
"Oscarkestra", where tone clusters are allowed to refract lazily in
subtle and intriquing ways, but it's with the busier overflowing
numbers like "Fihsis7" or the clanging funk of "Grestwrd" that Bible
really hits his stride. The dynamics are a little surer, and the focus
tightens up just enough to keep you listening. In any case, it's great
to see the CD making a comeback: being nostalgic about last week is
about the only way of knowing what's really going on these days." -
The Wire

"Is there a record that inspired more laptop electronica than
Incunabula? Sometimes it doesn't seem that there is. Fourteen years on
from its initial release, its influence continues to spread.
Autechre's classic first album impresses with its longevity. With
Myspace and other sites littered with Ae clones, only the most
dedicated fan can separate the wheat from the chaff and find that rare
musician that builds on Incunabula instead of mimeographs it. Jeremy
Bible is one of those rare musicians. At first glance, I Am Very
Uncomfortable... seems to be an album that would fall into the chaff
pile -- song titles like "grestwrd," "fihsis7." "scho11" are early
warning signs. But there is more than meets the eye. Few albums have
artwork that is more important than the music (Ogden's Nut Gone Flake,
anyone?), obviously. The ears make the judgement. If it doesn't sound
good, it's not going to be played much. What a relief that opener
"Oscarkestra" cannonballs into your head, setting the tone for the
next hour as truly epic. IAVUMOTT is continuously mixed, moving from
one mood on to another, gentle, forboding, druggy, but again with a
firm grasp of how cinematic music can be. Not cinematic in terms of
the cliched "soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist," but cinematic
in terms of 70 millimeter, wide open vistas where every detail is
clear. Apparently compiled over three years, these tracks sound
labored over, but not in a stifling way, they sound like they needed
that amount of time to come out right. Hearkening back to the glory
days of IDM (the Artificial Intelligence comps, Selected Ambient Works
85-92, Bytes), Jeremy Bible's work whets the appetite for more of a
classic yet innovative sound. This is found all over the album, but
most on the courageous closer, "gravel." For sixteen mind-blowing
minutes, Bible warps both beats and melody, seeming to slow them down
and drown them in bleeping synths only to let them break free and
slowly go insane. This happens over and over and over through the
course of this excellent album. And Mr. Bible, while you may very well
be uncomfortable, your music does not engender that feeling. I love
it." - Igloomag.com

"Some three years in the making, Cantonite Jeremy Bible's latest
effort i am very uncomfortable most of the time is a largely
atmospheric effort -- one that straddles the line between Vangelis's
Blade Runner soundtrack, and Brian Eno's minimalistic approach to
electronic music. Some of the material comes across as influenced by
early 1980's keyboard pop purveyors (Jones, Human League, Dolby); most
of the disc's 10 tracks are steeped in processed electronic, acoustic
and "found sounds." Ambient music incorporates many elements from many
different styles and genres, but its most identifiable quality is also
Bible's laser-like solitary focus: creating atmospheric soundscapes
and moods. From the opening strains of "oscarkestra" through high
points "grestwrd," the haunting "insoma" and "strand," Bible succeeds
admirably. He calls his style "abstract electronica." I call it pure
indulgence, worth all those years of tweaking." - Cool Cleveland

It was actually a little amusing... the most activity this list has seen

Really, you'd think we'd leave TRAAAT hanging on a hook (pun intended)?
 When I was setting up the temporary page for you're domain I was trying
my hardest to find some hot chick holding a trout... but they were
either not cute or holding it from the hook so it looks like they were
"hanging" you.  Glad you're back,  I kinda took the role of "unofficial
trout spokesperson" and by the weekend I already had people asking me if
I could update the ROM!

> maybe see y'all at koolaid saturday? depends how i feel quite honestly.

I'm going to probably be there.  As you'll probably tell when you go
through the mail I was really anxious the whole week.  I need to get out
and freakin relax now.

We were too busy triangulating evie stee's wherabouts... his relations
with these "dark tares"--as he puts it--is of the upmost concern.

Where can I buy a reactable and how much does it cost?
The reactable is not yet commercially produced, and we cannot tell when
that will exactly happen, neither what its price will be (in case it is
marketed). We are currently producing a few reactables on request for
specific places, such as museums, clubs, professional studios and
exhibitions. If you are interested in that context please contact us for
more information.


Depending on how sturdy the surface is, that would make a sweet coffee
table.  Mod some glasses with the various chips so at first people are
like "o cool, a table that glows" and then they put their glass down and
it starts making noises.  And it looks like something even I could
figure out (yeah, buzzmachines is fun... it's the figuring things out
part that sucks).  I just want to know where the 303 module is and how
many can be put on there at a time :D

Yeah agreed.  Cool conceptual peice but you can really do the same
thing and more sound design wise with your most basic synthesizer.
Its definitely a show piece.  Looks good on stage...has good visual
feedback.  Helps people see what synthesis looks like a bit.  I am
guessing that it wouldnt take much to mod it into a midi controller
that could control any synth.  Not sure if thats basically whats going
on inside it or not.

I prefered the video I recently watched where the guy made an
instrument out of people.  A note would play when he finished a
physical connection with a person and each person had a different
note.  The never whack Bruce Haack did something similar back in his
day.

Check the link that I posted the faq from.  They offer free software
that does kinda interface with other devices.  I didn't look into it too
much aside to see that it was there.  there's probalby some sort of midi
interface so you can have it in sync with other devices.  There's a
bjork video on youtube with it and you can see it constatly pulsing like
it's receiving a midi signal.  And one of the demos showed a guy using a
microphone as input to one of the modules.

Yeah, it would mainly be meant for when playing out as opposed to studio
work, but I still think it's neat.  I think the important thing is how
many of those modules can you put on there before things start lagging.

_Take Action: Petition to  Save Bush's Legacy By Persuading Him to Pardon 
Thousands of Nonviolent Drug  Offenders_ (http://ga0.org/campaign/pardons)  
 
President Bush's decision to spare Scooter Libby prison time -- having used  
the commutation power almost not at all previously -- has ignited a national  
debate on sentencing and incarceration. You can help by signing our online  
petition, "Save Bush's Legacy by Persuading Him to Pardon Thousands of  
Nonviolent Drug Offenders and Not Be a Hypocrite."  

 
Send this petition to: 
    *   President George W. Bush  
    *   Vice President Richard Cheney  
    *   Your Congressperson  
    *   Your Senators 

 
Dear President Bush:

We, the undersigned, ask you to save your legacy  by releasing thousands of 
nonviolent drug offenders from federal prison before  you leave office. Short 
of taking such a measure, you will be doomed to go down  in history as a 
hypocrite.

Unlike President Clinton, you cannot point to  a record of mercy toward 
people caught in the criminal justice system. While the  overall Clinton record in 
criminal justice was not lenient, he did commute the  sentences of 63 people, 
most of them neither wealthy nor powerful, including 29  nonviolent drug 
offenders.

You, by contrast, commuted only three  prisoners' sentences prior to helping 
Scooter Libby, one every two years. You  have pardoned four times as many 
Thanksgiving turkeys as people you've released  from prison.

Even worse, in 2003 your attorney general, John Ashcroft,  issued guidelines 
requiring federal prosecutors to always seek the maximum  possible amount of 
prison time for defendants, with only limited exceptions  permitted.

The measure we've called for will undoubtedly be  controversial, but you will 
have defenders from across the political spectrum.  Advocates will assist 
your staff in finding appropriate cases -- reopening cases  you've previously 
rejected would give the project a good head start. Clemency  petitions will 
undoubtedly start to pour in once you put the word out. You can  answer critics by 
saying we need to redirect our resources toward national  security instead. 
And it will be consistent with the sympathy you've expressed  in the past, based 
on your personal experiences, for people who have struggled  with substance 
abuse.

In the nation that is the world's leading jailer,  which incarcerates a far 
greater percentage of its population than any other  nation yet calls itself 
"land of the free," the president who helps to reverse  that pattern will 
ultimately be recognized for it. Indeed, the "tough-on-crime"  laws that have led us 
to this situation were mainly enacted for political  reasons. Please pardon 
or commute the sentences of thousands of nonviolent drug  offenders; please 
rescind the aforementioned Ashcroft directive; renounce your  support for the 
drug war (at least in its current form); and call on Congress to  repeal 
mandatory minimum sentences and authorize downward revision of most  federal 
sentencing guidelines.

You have a year and a half left to prove  that justice is for everyone -- not 
just for your friends. Will you rise to the  occasion? History is watching.  
Signed by:
[Your name] 
[Your address]

Friday, December 14: The Crystal Method [dj set]

This friday is still TBA, apparently.  I'm really glad to see some new

 So far, all I'm seeing is Good Stuff (TM), which is making everyone
happy.

the policy is that there is no policy.

that's the beauty of it.

if you find something wrong with the policy, it was never policy to begin
with.

well... this applies to you if you have money.  if not, tough shit.  is
tough shit a policy?  methinkso.

dont like what we're doing?  tough shit, you elected us.

QUOTE STEVEN T . -


'tares' is from the Holy Bible...

from KJV of Holy Bible from the Book of Matthew 13...

24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat
, and went his way.

26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
appeared the tares also.

27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,
didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it
tares?

28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto
him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up
also the wheat with them.

30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares,
and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my
barn.

31 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed
in his field:

32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is
the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of
the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.

33 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like
unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal,
till the whole was leavened.

34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and
without a parable spake he not unto them:

35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been
kept secret from the foundation of the world.

36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and
his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of
the tares of the field.

37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the
Son of man;

38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of
the world; and the reapers are the angels.

40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
shall it be in the end of this world.

41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather
out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;

42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing
and gnashing of teeth.

43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of
their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field;
the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth
and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking
goodly pearls:

46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all
that he had, and bought it.

47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into
the sea, and gathered of every kind:

48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and
gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be
wailing and gnashing of teeth.

51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They
say unto him, Yea, Lord.

52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed
unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.

53 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables,
he departed thence.

54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their
synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath
this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and
his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this
man all these things?

57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet
is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

I beginning to believe electronic music really is for selfish corporate  
conservatives that are only worried about their own interests rather than what's  
right for everybody. I've always liked music with a point to make. At least 
with  industrial, punk,metal or whatever the artists have the BALLS to speak 
their  mind. Doing so on this list usually results in upsetting people. Fuck the  
Thought Police. Can anyone turn me onto some music with nihilistic samples or 
 heart made within the last 5 years or so? I think I've lost my  faith.

So you want music with a "point" that contains "nihilistic" samples?  
That makes no sense to me.

How many times do I have to say I'm on psych meds cuz my brain don't  work 
right.
 
I was thinkin of industrial music and how a lot of it is very nihilistic at  
least it has emotion 
and also i just read this.  

"if you find something wrong with the policy, it was never policy to begin  
with."
 
The point is there is no point.

Perhaps, just perhaps, I am purposely seeking out music that is just  
"fun" when I listen to electronic music. Perhaps I get a kick out of  
sampling old records I find at the library for 50 cents. Perhaps I  
hear enough whiney bastards complianing about how unjust they think  
their lives are the other 23.99 hours of the day and an escape is nice.

People who spend their entire lives constantly living in a permanent  
fox news alert miss what's really at issue, tend to put themselves in  
a constant state of paranoia, and tend to lose the ability to think on  
their own.

I couldn't agree with you more. That's exactly the kind of "point" that I  
like to see expressed in music to have an impact on people while entertaining  
them. That's what I like....to each their own.

Hell, if that were true, I'd probably go to raves again.

When I was stupid enough to think my vote made a difference I choose the  
lesser of the 2 evils and usually went all Democrat. After George stole the  
election I realized what a fool I have been to how things really are. 
 
There is a difference between whinnying and trying to combat apathy.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

View e-flyer and sample CD at: www.ultrarecords.com/ECards/Kaskade
Bring the Night is the latest mix album by house DJ/producer Kaskade. 
Released on Ultra Records, Bring the Night is crafted to give unwavering 
house heads what they want most in a mix album: it delivers on the party 
front and drops the big room jams. And true to Kaskade styleand what 
differentiates this artist from others in dance musicBring the Night 
also manages to serve up those trademark melodies and sensual vocals.
But more than anything, this is 115 minutes of feel good body rock. 
"With my artist albums, I'm conveying emotion, I'm constructing beats 
and writing songs that represent me as an artist and a person, so it 
doesn't necessarily come out as 'dance heavy,'" says Kaskade. "But a mix 
CD is about walking the line, and fitting my style in with the DJ side 
of things. Yeah, I want to keep it musical and fresh, but Bring the 
Night is intentionally produced very rhythmic andwell, banging. This is 
a head bobbing mix, something to pop in your car and thump."
And with 15 hard-hitting tracks, including Dance Chart topping Kaskade 
remixes of Nelly Furtado's "All Good Things (Come To An End)", and 
Floetry's "SupaStar," Bring the Night achieves just thatit's a non-stop, 
seamless stream of orchestrated beats and flavor, all with a nod to the 
night life.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Subject: Re: {pb-cle}music generally without lyrics

Sound is capable of expressing more than words will ever come close
to.  Words are vague. Structured human language is very limited in
terms of emotional expression.

I'm actually quite turned off at this point by art/music that
references anti-bush sentiments through lyrics, samples, or images.
"Artists" decide they want to make a political statement through their
art and lately it all seems to default to bush.....it seems so generic
at this point.    Yeah he is a clown and we all know that...tell us
something we donut know.  You want your art to be profound...make an
impact....do something else.  Its been done to death for the last 7
years.

People talk too much as it is.  Manufacturing combinations of words
they think will have in impact.  "Lets say something shocking" or
"lets think of something profound to say".  It all seems so contrived
anymore.  For me I use voices in music like I see it in the real
world....boiling it down to what it really is (through field recording
btw).  Meaningless background noise.  Hundreds of disgusting mouths
spouting idle meaningless chatter that builds into a wall of noise.
This in itself has meaning.

When you say 'electronic music' I take it your are referring primarily
to the 'dance music' side of electronic music...which yes for the most
part is hollow and empty.  You want electronic music you can feel
something in.....the club is not the place you are going to find it.
And the unfortunate thing is most people donut want to go out and hear
music that is going to make them think or feel anything.  They want to
go out and be comfortable, drink, flirt, and forget about who they
really are.  They simply want a backdrop to their apathy while
attempting to attach themselves to some semblance of identity within a
social society.

Unfortunately art is dead within the intermediate populous.
Everything is now part of an umbrella marketing campaign to embed
simplistic values of commercialism and callousness.  An effort to make
mediocre acceptable.  Its not the 50's anymore where abstract
expressionist painters were treated as if they were royalty.

These days the only group that seems to appreciate art anymore are
artists.  Artists in the true sense of the word.  Not commercial
artists.  95% percent of people who purchase my albums and/or have
appreciation for what I do are people who make music themselves.  Its
quite strange.  Where is the line drawn between fan and peer?  I guess
its the most one can hope for......is respect amongst peers who have
an intimate understanding for what you are doing and why.

The sad part is...for most there is little chance of avoiding being a
part of this campaign.  It is so embedded into the fabric of our
society that it is either do or die.  Me for example...I despise what
I do professionally.  I program data driven print campaigns that are
designed to receive a greater response rate by getting more personal
with the customer base.  Its like personalized spam for print.  Where
your name is in the design, written on the wall, etc...or your car,
make, model, color is on a postcard.  Or it comes with a URL with your
name in it.  "Lets pretend to know these people so we can get them to
respond better.  Lets trick them into thinking we are talking directly
to them."  The people, attitudes, simple mindedness, and deceitful
rhetoric I have to deal with on a day to day basis make me sick and
depressed a good deal of the time.  I went from one company to another
last year just to realize I went from one evil to an even greater
evil...by going from managing a private company's internal department
to a public service provider's department with 100's of corporate
clients and always hungry for more.  Now its like working for 100's of
companies rather than one.  Now instead of feeling like an appreciated
part of a well oiled machine I am treated as a simple commodity in an
environment where tactics are in place to attempt to make you feel
less valuable than you really are. Great choice...but at the time I
thought it was what I had to do to move ahead and better support my
family and further develop and pursue my life's work/passions that
require more investment than reap profits.

We all work hard to get ahead only to lessen our individual value.
Meaning less.

So what am I saying?  The meaning was lost in words.  I guess
ultimately I am expressing contempt for our social organism in which
we are all parasites with little or no say in the matter.

How I got here from the instigating topic?  And no doubt I am guilty
of multiple contradictions in this message.  Such is the nature of
words.  The topic triggered venting I apparently needed to do I
suppose.

Meaningless.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle}music generally without lyrics

indeed.  but isnt art what you make of it.

or more importantly isnt art what you can convince others is actually art.

i mean look at that one famous red/yellow/blue painting.  you know the 
one with the blue square and some red & yellow lines.  is it art?  
someone thinks it is.

discuss.

 Ok this computer is practically brand new. I uninstalled Napster that came with it. Now almost every program I try to use says it can't find MSVCR71.dll. Should I just use vista system restore? Can i just dl MSVCR71.dll? Where should I put it? Did this happen because I unistalled Napster or is from a virus?

            Thank you

sorry about that I don't know why I thought this was a tech help list. I'll figure it out. Remember when search engines worked? Are there any good search engines?

does vista have sfc?  It's worked a few times on family's computers that
"suddenly, for no reason, stopped working........after I did [...]"

And i please hope you weren't honestly asking if there were any good
search engines out there?  Although I guess ask.com's search is pretty
neat if you're looking up a general topic of interest or band or
something.  Where google's is "I WANTZ TEH ANSERZ NOW!" which is 99.99%
+/-0.01% what I want.

The extent of my computer programing was some basic on an apple IIc over 15  
years ago in high school. All I know is years ago when there were search 
engines  like alta vista, excite,lycos and info seek. I entered something and 
usually the  first result got me the answer I wanted. Now all search engines do is 
give me  wikipedia and 1000 sites tryin to sell you something.

I think the oddity is that guys like Sasha and BT are touring with not  
laptops but iMac's. Its sort of the next generation of the cycle. Soon  
they'll be using Mac Pros and giant CRT's. Then 8 tracks wired up via  
USB.

Really though, I guess its not too weird to think they'd want the  
screen real estate in Live. A 13" display on my MacBook gets me like 5  
channel strips once I start talking inserts. If you're messing with  
VST's, even if they're monitoring scopes, your screen can start  
shrinking down quick.

You mean to tell me they don't have a set pre-mixed...Why not?...I think  
laptop/iMac DJ's click play then look at porn or play solitaire for an  hour.

It's kind of like asking, why don't casinos just cheat people, since
they own all the games?

Because they make more money doing everything legit and making sure
things are honest.  If any of the big time DJs in this day and age
with youtube and instant information were to fake their sets, it would
be disastrous.

Plus Sasha has been on the computer interaction "next level" DJ thing
for quite a while now, even having a custom controller built for use
with ableton...

ILM doesn't have the best lasers.  Lightwave does.  Period.

When its so easy to prep an Ableton set and so much fun to play it,  
why would anyone fake it? Even if you did do a prior take, it can be  
so much fun to resample that. I guess its the difference between  
refusing to bang porn starlets every night after doing it daily and  
just spitting on her back after you get bored with it.

-------------------------------1191182907
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Ok I just read the wiki's for the last wave of superstar DJ's. I  think these 
guys did more for the demise of electronic dance music than anything  else. 
BT Stutter...granular synthesis....nano-correcting...very interesting but  does 
it make the music any more danceable? I've heard more danceable music made  
on a playstation 1. No wonder they charge ridiculous amounts for a gig. BT's  
whole studio has been robbed twice. You think he'd learn the first  time. 
Crackhead Keoki at least had a personality. I guess I just liked  it raw. Just like 
my grammar. I hate grammar instead of two, to or too I'm just  gonna type tu. 
Why do people want tu waste time on useless structure? At what  point does it 
become overkill? Jungle kept my interest for awhile with  progression of 
production techniques and then it just died. I'm confused now. I  don't know what 
I am complaining about anymore. Its just not what it used to be.  Maybe its 
just me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Superstar DJ's

On this, we agree.

BT is a fucking idiot.  Anyone who uses the words "nano correcting" when  
talking about their music should be shot.

The irony is that music like BT's and all that crap is about the easiest  
thing to make electronically...because you don't have to have any sort of  
songwriting, musical skills, or soul to do it.  It's 100% removed from  
what dance music is about:  the dance floor.

the technology in and of itself isnt bad..its how its used...granular

granular engine...really sick things can be done when u LFO or envelope
control the grain controls...i agree about the stutter being tottally
played out at this point....it was cool at first...but its not really
too creative...especially when u have VST's that do it for u...it used
to be u had to setup a complex set of modulations on your sampler or
manually chop, reverse, and mangle something into a stutter, now u just
slap on an effect as an insert...thats lazy and pretty un-creative to
me....thats really my big gripe about people that do things tottally in
the box...the speed is nice(especially not having to manually replug
cables)....but the creativity and using what you have is taken away
when u can have thousands of effects and instruments with millions of
presets...alot of ppl arent really creating their own sound anymore,
they are just basically dj'ing presets.

the technology in and of itself isnt bad..its how its used...granular
synthesis is actually really cool...i dont use kontakt often
anymore(why would i with an emu?)but when i do, its stricktly for its
granular engine...really sick things can be done when u LFO or envelope
control the grain controls...i agree about the stutter being tottally
played out at this point....it was cool at first...but its not really
too creative...especially when u have VST's that do it for u...it used
to be u had to setup a complex set of modulations on your sampler or
manually chop, reverse, and mangle something into a stutter, now u just
slap on an effect as an insert...thats lazy and pretty un-creative to
me....thats really my big gripe about people that do things tottally in
the box...the speed is nice(especially not having to manually replug
cables)....but the creativity and using what you have is taken away
when u can have thousands of effects and instruments with millions of
presets...alot of ppl arent really creating their own sound anymore,
they are just basically dj'ing presets.

You missed the entire point, Nick.

It doesn't matter HOW a song is made, it matters if the song is any damn  
good.

On, the heady days of Sputnik, Yuri Gregarin and impulse tracker. I  
can remember uudecoding multipart usenet posts to listen to old James  
Watts (u4ia) mods as my first introduction to electronic music. One of  
those stupid expensive UK mags that comes with a DVD had a special on  
trackers a few months back, the only reason I dumped the $16 on it.

One of the reasons I've been wanting to re-acquire a machinedrum is  
the tracker like programming. I like many creative types get a kick  
out of pushing the boundries of a limited environment.

Around the same time I was playing with trackers in my basement I  
remember playing the game Ultima 6. Two floppy disks and a very well  
rounded world to explore. We have all this technology but where has it  
gotten us? Horrible gated trance sounds and pretty pictures in games.

Has anyone really pushed the boundries of current hardware in every  
sense of the word? Not if you ask me. I just sit and think about  
what's possible and am extremely disapponted in what's actually being  
done.

Hence my perpetual comment on vinyl vs. Digital.... I dont care if  
you're making your tracks with a Radio Shack mic and three peanut  
shells -- what you are doing it with doesn't matter anymore since the  
creative canvas can have about anything applied to it and it really  
doesn't matter.

I really don't care about his music, I really don't care about his  
mental capcity, I really don't care about his synthesis geekiness.

I can't stand that in EVERY interview I ever read/hear/see with him  
he name drops that everyone is his best friend.

That's because most of these geeky electronic dorks are just that:  big

Amen to that.  I will never switch to completely laptop.  Even  when I spin 
rock music in bars I do it with vinyl or CDs.  There is no  substitute for real 
knowledge of music and a hands on approach to making it the  best experience 
possible.  Those guys who put together a playlist on the  computer...how are 
they different from a jukebox!  Some of them can't even  shave off that spoken 
intro on Smoke Two Joints!!

Stevie you claim to have started the scene by makin mixtapes of Tears for  
Fears and New Order. Man I did WAYYY more for the scene than you...When I was 10 
 years old me and my little brother would sample burp and fart noises and 
play  them back on the pads of his casio SK-5 keyboard. This was before MP3's the 
only  way to get your tracks out was to prank phone call people. We were so 
ahead of  our times we were childhood prodigy's. In fact we started the ISP and 
networked  the voodoo people.When Fast Tracker 2 became obsolete we were 
runnin Cubase on  our Colecovision ADAM computer. MDMA u dig? As prophesized the 
utah saints are  coming to get you for sodomizing those blacked out 17 year old 
Mormon  boys after the smoke jumpers took care of the fortune 500 lab on 
three mile  island in Macedonia.
