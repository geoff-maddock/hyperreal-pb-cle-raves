	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm

http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Oct 10                    STANTON WARRIORS                   Pittsburgh

Kicking off their North American Tour here in Pittsburgh at Altar bar.

Here is their bio if you would like to learn more about them...

True pioneers of a sound that broke all the rules back in 1998, Stanton 
Warriors took garage and twisted it beyond all recognition, dropping 
speaker shattering bass lines and massive beats.all to devastating 
effect. Stanton Warriors had arrived.

In 2001, Stanton Warriors laid down a fresh new sound with the seminal 
.Stanton Sessions. that was instantly signed to XL Recordings. The mix 
saw off competition from Fat Boy Slim and Deep Dish to win Best Album at 
the Dance Star Awards, and again at the Muzik Mag Awards where they beat 
Dave Clarke and Danny Tenaglia, whilst the mix recently featured in 
Mixmags top 50 best compilations ever industry poll. 'Stanton Sessions' 
went on to become the biggest selling breaks album of all time - a feat 
as yet unsurpassed.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

**A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Oct 10                    STANTON WARRIORS                   Pittsburgh

Kicking off their North American Tour here in Pittsburgh at Altar bar.

Here is their bio if you would like to learn more about them...

True pioneers of a sound that broke all the rules back in 1998, Stanton 
Warriors took garage and twisted it beyond all recognition, dropping 
speaker shattering bass lines and massive beats.all to devastating 
effect. Stanton Warriors had arrived.

In 2001, Stanton Warriors laid down a fresh new sound with the seminal 
.Stanton Sessions. that was instantly signed to XL Recordings. The mix 
saw off competition from Fat Boy Slim and Deep Dish to win Best Album at 
the Dance Star Awards, and again at the Muzik Mag Awards where they beat 
Dave Clarke and Danny Tenaglia, whilst the mix recently featured in 
Mixmags top 50 best compilations ever industry poll. 'Stanton Sessions' 
went on to become the biggest selling breaks album of all time - a feat 
as yet unsurpassed.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

**A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

Subject: {pb-cle} Jean-Pierre Gauthier's sound sculptures at Akron Art Museum

Not sure how this landed in Akron, Ohio but I am very glad it did.
After reading about his work for years this is the first time I have
had an opportunity to see his work in person and it was fantastic.
Apparently its the US exclusive appearance of his work.  I would
honestly have to say that this is the greatest contemporary creative
work to ever touch Ohio soil...in my lifetime at least.
http://akronartmuseum.org/exhibitions/details.php?unid=3D721

Montr=E9al artist, inventor and musician Jean-Pierre Gauthier brings
humor and poetry to his kinetic sculptural installations. This
exhibition, the first survey of the award-winning artist's work, will
make its exclusive U.S. appearance at the Akron Art Museum.

Gauthier ingeniously transforms electrical cable, funnels, pulleys and
other industrial and everyday objects into living, moving, singing
organisms. His dynamic installations invoke the opposing forces of
order and chaos, permanence and fragility. Each work invites the
viewer to experience and interact with its visual, sound, and moving
parts.

Among the works featured in the exhibition is Beats and Butterflies, a
spectacular glistening piano that plays when viewers move through the
room. Gauthier in fact views all of his materials as instruments. In
Rut, motors, wires, microphones, mixing boards and amplifiers are set
in motion to create mesmerizing rhythmic and auditory movements. The
seemingly jumbled network of conduits is in fact a highly orchestrated
mechanism that creates a multi-sensory experience of space and time.

Born in 1965 in Matane (Quebec Province), Gauthier has lived and
worked in Montr=E9al since 1986. Jean-Pierre Gauthier: Machines at Play
is comprised of artwork made from 2002 to the present.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

SINISTER MOVEMENT PRESENT....

ILL INSANITY

ROB SWIFT VS PRECISION VS TOTAL ECLIPSE(6 TURNTABLES 3 MIXERS!!!!!!)

What do DJs Rob Swift, Precision, and Total Eclipse have in common? The 
letter X... as in X-ecutioners!  Now, a decade since the conception of 
the worlds most accomplished DJ crew, these three champions of an art 
called "Turntablism" are beginning a new chapter in their careers.

Their emphasis is to start from scratch (pun intended) and break down 
all limitations. "We're training our minds to forget and abandon 
everything we've learned about DJing to this point" according to Rob 
Swift. Total Eclipse adds "When we get together to create routines, we 
start from nothing and see where the vibe in the room takes us." 
Precision caps it off by saying "The long hours we dedicate to practice 
usually leads to some real crazy routines." Thus, the inspiration to 
call the themselves ILL INSANITY.

Rob Swift says, "ILL INSANITY is the ending and beginning of something 
that started 18 years ago," an honorable mention goes out to the X-men. 
He goes on to further explain... "No matter what, people will always 
remember what the X-ecutioners contributed to Hip Hop. Therefore, 
comparing whatever we do now, as ILL INSANITY, to back then." But while 
acknowledging the connection they'll forever have to the legendary DJ 
group, they emphasize... "That was then and this is now... without 
change there's no progress." And it seems that's their number one goal: 
to find new and innovative ways to use the turntable as a musical 
instrument and help the art form of DJing/Turntablism evolve. "There's a 
whole new generation of music fans we need to introduce Turntablism to" 
adds Total Eclipse, "and once again we're taking it upon ourselves to 
lead the way!" Rob goes on to emphasize, "ILL INSANITY is our way of 
reinventing ourselves and coming back stronger. Not just creatively but 
mentally."

The buzz in the turntable community is that the scene is on the verge of 
dying but ILL INSANITY insists "We refuse to let that happen!" Rob sums 
it all up this way, "Yeah, we've had hit songs with multi-platinum 
artists like Linkin Park, we've appeared in music videos, commercials, 
even talk shows like Late Night with David Letterman. We've scored the 
music for video games and movies, and toured the globe, but we're not 
done! While those are impressive accomplishments for a turntable crew, 
ILL INSANITY looks at that time period as preparation for what we're 
about to do from here on. It's about to get really serious!"

Their live show consists of a group performance, individual turntable 
solos and all around party rocking. Three hours of non-stop turntable 
theatrics by three of the best DJs in the game.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

Sat Nov 08                  TOTAL REQUEST RAVE 3                    Toronto

Toronto is home to many talented DJs, many fine promoters, and many 
excellent producers. But the one thing that truly sets Toronto's rave 
community apart as one of the world's best is YOU - the enthusiastic, 
passionate, PLURry, and downright amazing ravers who come together each 
event to build something special. We at NC and Embedded recognize how 
lucky we are to have such an incredible group of people around us, and 
that's why every year, we give you an event to truly call your own, 
putting YOU in charge of the music just like YOU are always in charge of 
the vibe.

Ravers... it's that time again!

On Saturday, November 8th, Nocturnal Commissions joins forces once again 
with Embedded Entertainment and YOU to put on the world's only 
fully-interactive rave experience - TOTAL REQUEST RAVE!!

If you were at the first two, you already know how - and why - this has 
rapidly become Toronto's favourite event, with ravers coming from all 
over the continent and performers from all across the globe to take part 
in this special experience. If you missed TRR 1 and 2, then this is your 
chance to find out what it's all about!

Enjoy a truly international lineup, with talented performers from all 
across the globe, including:

Vapour [UK] - Ever since "Goal!" Vapour has been looking forward to the 
chance to return to Toronto for another chance to party with our world 
class ravers, and we're excited to bring his extra-bouncy hardcore back 
to this side of the pond!

across the ocean with some of the most slammin' hard house you'll ever 
hear!

your chance to see why!

Mizz Lee b2b Lucy Ford - The First Ladies of Drum and Bass return once 
again to the NC stage!

lamp-shade wearing breaks!

[USA] and George (Who Spins Records) once again take the stage to 
perform the songs you select!

We always go above and beyond to bring you creative, quality rave 
experiences, but we'll be honest - Total Request Rave is always our 
favourite event, and we're going to even further lengths to make this a 
night for the history books! What does that mean for you? It means:

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

SINISTER MOVEMENT PRESENT....

ILL INSANITY

ROB SWIFT VS PRECISION VS TOTAL ECLIPSE(6 TURNTABLES 3 MIXERS!!!!!!)

What do DJs Rob Swift, Precision, and Total Eclipse have in common? The 
letter X... as in X-ecutioners!  Now, a decade since the conception of 
the worlds most accomplished DJ crew, these three champions of an art 
called "Turntablism" are beginning a new chapter in their careers.

Their emphasis is to start from scratch (pun intended) and break down 
all limitations. "We're training our minds to forget and abandon 
everything we've learned about DJing to this point" according to Rob 
Swift. Total Eclipse adds "When we get together to create routines, we 
start from nothing and see where the vibe in the room takes us." 
Precision caps it off by saying "The long hours we dedicate to practice 
usually leads to some real crazy routines." Thus, the inspiration to 
call the themselves ILL INSANITY.

Rob Swift says, "ILL INSANITY is the ending and beginning of something 
that started 18 years ago," an honorable mention goes out to the X-men. 
He goes on to further explain... "No matter what, people will always 
remember what the X-ecutioners contributed to Hip Hop. Therefore, 
comparing whatever we do now, as ILL INSANITY, to back then." But while 
acknowledging the connection they'll forever have to the legendary DJ 
group, they emphasize... "That was then and this is now... without 
change there's no progress." And it seems that's their number one goal: 
to find new and innovative ways to use the turntable as a musical 
instrument and help the art form of DJing/Turntablism evolve. "There's a 
whole new generation of music fans we need to introduce Turntablism to" 
adds Total Eclipse, "and once again we're taking it upon ourselves to 
lead the way!" Rob goes on to emphasize, "ILL INSANITY is our way of 
reinventing ourselves and coming back stronger. Not just creatively but 
mentally."

The buzz in the turntable community is that the scene is on the verge of 
dying but ILL INSANITY insists "We refuse to let that happen!" Rob sums 
it all up this way, "Yeah, we've had hit songs with multi-platinum 
artists like Linkin Park, we've appeared in music videos, commercials, 
even talk shows like Late Night with David Letterman. We've scored the 
music for video games and movies, and toured the globe, but we're not 
done! While those are impressive accomplishments for a turntable crew, 
ILL INSANITY looks at that time period as preparation for what we're 
about to do from here on. It's about to get really serious!"

Their live show consists of a group performance, individual turntable 
solos and all around party rocking. Three hours of non-stop turntable 
theatrics by three of the best DJs in the game.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

Sat Nov 08                  TOTAL REQUEST RAVE 3                    Toronto

Toronto is home to many talented DJs, many fine promoters, and many 
excellent producers. But the one thing that truly sets Toronto's rave 
community apart as one of the world's best is YOU - the enthusiastic, 
passionate, PLURry, and downright amazing ravers who come together each 
event to build something special. We at NC and Embedded recognize how 
lucky we are to have such an incredible group of people around us, and 
that's why every year, we give you an event to truly call your own, 
putting YOU in charge of the music just like YOU are always in charge of 
the vibe.

Ravers... it's that time again!

On Saturday, November 8th, Nocturnal Commissions joins forces once again 
with Embedded Entertainment and YOU to put on the world's only 
fully-interactive rave experience - TOTAL REQUEST RAVE!!

If you were at the first two, you already know how - and why - this has 
rapidly become Toronto's favourite event, with ravers coming from all 
over the continent and performers from all across the globe to take part 
in this special experience. If you missed TRR 1 and 2, then this is your 
chance to find out what it's all about!

Enjoy a truly international lineup, with talented performers from all 
across the globe, including:

Vapour [UK] - Ever since "Goal!" Vapour has been looking forward to the 
chance to return to Toronto for another chance to party with our world 
class ravers, and we're excited to bring his extra-bouncy hardcore back 
to this side of the pond!

Garbo [UK] - Host of some of the best events in the UK, Garbo storms 
across the ocean with some of the most slammin' hard house you'll ever 
hear!

Opel - Our own DJ Opel is a crowd favourite around the world, and here's 
your chance to see why!

Mizz Lee b2b Lucy Ford - The First Ladies of Drum and Bass return once 
again to the NC stage!

Station - DJs Xofer and Opel are the world's foremost purveyors of 
lamp-shade wearing breaks!

Xphox - Toronto Hardcore's fast rising star, Xphox is ready to shake his 
bottom and make you shake yours!

The Buzz - Fuzzboy and the Bliz, all in one go - can YOU handle it?!?

Tyco b2b Dave of the Rave - Local legend Tyco reunites with NC's own 
Dave of the Rave to pour concentrated awesome all over the dancefloor!

Restricted Viewing - The Brain Cell boys take the stage to lift your 
spirits with their own unique trance stylings!

Destructo - This Beat Rancher is off the range to rustle up some hard 
bangin' beats and herd them your way!

Trixie Firecracka - What do all the best Hard House songs have in 
common? They're in this Londoner's record bag!

Rolls Royce [USA] - American up and comer Rolls Royce is ready to 
celebrate the summer with proper hardcore choonage!

M@ - Local up and comer M@ has great music and long hair! Hey, it worked 
for Jim Morrison!

And as always, YOU will have your chance to choose the music, as Dynamic 
[USA] and George (Who Spins Records) once again take the stage to 
perform the songs you select!

We always go above and beyond to bring you creative, quality rave 
experiences, but we'll be honest - Total Request Rave is always our 
favourite event, and we're going to even further lengths to make this a 
night for the history books! What does that mean for you? It means:

- Free glowsticks for the first 300 attendees - use them to vote on the 
songs YOU want to hear during the TRR set! (And don't forget to give a 
couple of lightshows during the night, too!)
- Special limited edition CDs from DJ Opel and from DJ Dynamic for first 
time ravers AND the people who bring them! Bring a friend to get yours!
- Projection screens for our raviest voting yet!
- Fresh fruit and candy giveaways through the night to keep your energy 
up!

- And most importantly of all: that one-of-a-kind, positively-intense, 
hot-like-the-sun-and-wet-like-the-rain, happiest-of-happy-hardcore 
Nocturnal Commissions vibe that YOU bring with you, to each and every 
one of our events!!! There ain't nothin' else like it, and it's all 
because of you!

hardcore ravers, and the night belongs to us!

This is a special Valentines Day Party

The idea is for everyone to wear 'I <3' T-Shirts, or no shirt, or u can 
pay $5 more... so u decide.

We are encouraging people to be creative and make your own shirt because 
there will be contests for the best 'I <3' shirts!

Also, at midnight there will be a huge group photo of everyone in their 
'I <3' shirts! copies of the photo will be made to be distributed.

Lineup coming soon!

Lets be a lil more creative than I <3 NY

yeah man, vote for nader, i'm so cool and i'm voting my belief in who shoul=
d
be president, and i'm oblivious to the fact that my other peers dont vote
and the ones that do are voting for nader because they are so cool in their
irony.

...

here's the reality.  if you dont vote for obama, you're voting for mccain.
it's that easy.  there is no personal choice here, the system is fucked up
and it's not getting fixed in the 12 days to the election.  it's not gettin=
g
fixed until after the next epic natural disaster, terrorist attack, coup
d'etat, or dissolution of the american government.  all of which really don=
t
look like they're happening until after 2034 when most of the oil in the
world is gone.

while i fully support voicing your concerns and supporting a candidate to
get out the message that you believe in, even I plan on voting for Obama
this year when I'd rather vote for Bob Barr, James Traficant, or Mickey
Mouse because i know in Ohio and Pennsylvania the races are close, and they
are key states in the race.  dont believe the poll numbers thinking obama's
got this locked up, they're calling people that a good minority of the obam=
a
supporters of them wont show up to vote anyways - and that is where the
closeness of the race is.

give money to nader's campaign, go to his rallies, get out and let your
neighbors and communities know about your views and how you think america
can be, but for fuck sake dont toss your vote down the toilet just to get
nader up to 7.2% of the popular vote and call it a "win".

All votes are a waste voted and waste of time. Voting for the lesser of 2
evils is more apathetic than not voting at all to me. I'll be able to sleep
better knowing I didn't take any part in putting the douchebag resposible
for the RAVE Act in vp.

Not my point.  Yes I know what list this is.  My point is.....there
are bigger issues at stack than wether you are allowed to munch pills
in an abandoned warehouse until the sun comes up.  These are global
issues that affect everyone in the world.  Obama's policies on
education should be of interest to a creative community such as this
one where he wants to ensure arts and music are not eliminated from
school curriculum....as well as more eduction for the sciences.
My point is....that are more important issues at stake than the 'rave act'.

Exactly, Jeremy.

Anyone who doesn't vote for Obama due to Biden's part in the "Rave
Act" from 12 or so years ago is EVERY BIT AS CLOSED-MINDED AND SHORT
SIGHTED as the Right Wing one-issue voters who choose their candidates
based solely on Pro-Life stance.

The world is bigger than you and me. The world is bigger than parties.
The world is bigger than the United States.

And to those perpetual verbal masturbators who say "It doesn't matter
if you vote, you have no say..." I counter with:

Whether you think you make a difference or not, you're absolutely right.

Exactly... it wasn"t Biden's part He was the RAVE act. It was grotesque
destruction of civil liberties slid in under the Amber Alert. Even more
appauling than the PATRIOT ACT the way it was passed. He responsible for a
lot more legislation that destroyed of civil liberties. You won't convince
the obamaBots that they are anything less than briliant. They are going to
save the world with that vote for Obama. Paris Hilton told them so on MTV.
1984 was not an instruction manual. Keep fighting amongst yourselves. War i=
s
peace. You Ohio people should be the first ones to boycott the polls from
what happened last time

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} obama all natural? who cares!

Either vote *for* someone or don't bother voting at all. The whole
voting the lesser of two evils thing is beyond retarded. You still get
evil, only slightly slower. That said, Biden is almost enough to make me
not vote for Obama. Almost. 

Too bad the Libertarians had to go and choose a turd like Barr.

Ok...yeah...fuck Joe Biden for pulling bullshit policy votes.=A0 I get that=
.
However...I haven't been affected by the RAVE in any way shape or form.
There are still awesome djs and live pa's playing shows underground and at =
clubs around the country.=A0=A0=20

Do you know a venue owner in jail under the strong arm of the "RAVE Act"?
I'm not saying it hasn't happened....but its not very relevant for this 200=
8 election.=A0=20
After the "Patriot Act" the "Rave Act" is minor league shit.

I do have a friend with a leg that was blown off in senseless middle easter=
n war fought for US oil companies.



Exactly... it wasn"t Biden's part He was the RAVE act. It was grotesque des=
truction of civil liberties slid in under the Amber Alert. Even more appaul=
ing than the PATRIOT ACT the way it was passed. He responsible for a lot mo=

You know that the RAVE Act didn't actually pass, right?  It was renamed
the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act and some changes were made

          <div id="yiv917993910">Exactly... it wasn"t Biden's part He
was the RAVE act. It was grotesque destruction of civil liberties slid
in under the Amber Alert. Even more appauling than the PATRIOT ACT the
way it was passed. He responsible for a lot more legislation that
destroyed of civil liberties. You won't convince the obamaBots that
they are anything less than briliant. They are going to save the world
with that vote for Obama. Paris Hilton told them so on MTV. 1984 was
not an instruction manual. Keep fighting amongst yourselves. War is
peace. You Ohio people should be the first ones to boycott the polls
from what happened last time <br>

&gt; Exactly, Jeremy.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyone who doesn't vote for Obama due to Biden's part in the "Rave<br>
&gt; Act" from 12 or so years ago is EVERY BIT AS CLOSED-MINDED AND
SHORT<br>
&gt; SIGHTED as the Right Wing one-issue voters who choose their
candidates<br>
&gt; based solely on Pro-Life stance.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The world is bigger than you and me. The world is bigger than
parties.<br>
&gt; The world is bigger than the United States.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; And to those perpetual verbal masturbators who say "It doesn't
matter<br>
&gt; if you vote, you have no say..." I counter with:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Whether you think you make a difference or not, you're absolutely
right.<br>

the Washington Post about Joe Biden:

"Check out the people you're voting for.... "For instance, Joseph Biden
comes off as a liberal Democrat, but he's the one who authored the bill tha=
t
put me in jail. He wrote the law against shipping drug paraphernalia throug=
h
the mail - which could be anything from a pipe to a clip or cigarette
papers."

sounds like someone is working on grabbing the mixes and creating a
torrent but just for those interested:
1. download torrent program like utorrent, http://utorrent.com
2. create a new torrent selecting the folder that contains the "stuff"
(in this case, music) you want to share
3. here are a couple open trackers you don't need to register or
anything (utorrent needs a blank line between these):
http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce
http://tracker.prq.to/announce
4. upload the .torrent file to some place like mediafire.com (this file
is pretty small)
5. post that link on lists
6. ...
7. PROFIT! (sorry, was too tempting)

Possibly the most important vote you can cast will be for Democrat John
Morganelli for Attorney General. Corbett and his republican gestapo must go.
Democrats have never had attorney general in PA. Corbett and his anti-drug
witch hunts responsible for ruining so many good people's lives must go.
Attorney General is the highest law enforcement postion in PA and the
republicans have constantly used the power seat to attack Democrat
polticians and mask their own corruption. Corbett's regime is highly
anti-drug while Morganelli has no mention of drug war bullshit in his
platform. Lets get rid of Corbett and his republican terror squads. No more
Corbett means cut backs in burea of narcotics investigation and drug
control. I know I'd like to see some of those narcotics agents lose their
jobs.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

SINISTER MOVEMENT PRESENT....

ILL INSANITY

ROB SWIFT VS PRECISION VS TOTAL ECLIPSE(6 TURNTABLES 3 MIXERS!!!!!!)

What do DJs Rob Swift, Precision, and Total Eclipse have in common? The 
letter X... as in X-ecutioners!  Now, a decade since the conception of 
the worlds most accomplished DJ crew, these three champions of an art 
called "Turntablism" are beginning a new chapter in their careers.

Their emphasis is to start from scratch (pun intended) and break down 
all limitations. "We're training our minds to forget and abandon 
everything we've learned about DJing to this point" according to Rob 
Swift. Total Eclipse adds "When we get together to create routines, we 
start from nothing and see where the vibe in the room takes us." 
Precision caps it off by saying "The long hours we dedicate to practice 
usually leads to some real crazy routines." Thus, the inspiration to 
call the themselves ILL INSANITY.

Rob Swift says, "ILL INSANITY is the ending and beginning of something 
that started 18 years ago," an honorable mention goes out to the X-men. 
He goes on to further explain... "No matter what, people will always 
remember what the X-ecutioners contributed to Hip Hop. Therefore, 
comparing whatever we do now, as ILL INSANITY, to back then." But while 
acknowledging the connection they'll forever have to the legendary DJ 
group, they emphasize... "That was then and this is now... without 
change there's no progress." And it seems that's their number one goal: 
to find new and innovative ways to use the turntable as a musical 
instrument and help the art form of DJing/Turntablism evolve. "There's a 
whole new generation of music fans we need to introduce Turntablism to" 
adds Total Eclipse, "and once again we're taking it upon ourselves to 
lead the way!" Rob goes on to emphasize, "ILL INSANITY is our way of 
reinventing ourselves and coming back stronger. Not just creatively but 
mentally."

The buzz in the turntable community is that the scene is on the verge of 
dying but ILL INSANITY insists "We refuse to let that happen!" Rob sums 
it all up this way, "Yeah, we've had hit songs with multi-platinum 
artists like Linkin Park, we've appeared in music videos, commercials, 
even talk shows like Late Night with David Letterman. We've scored the 
music for video games and movies, and toured the globe, but we're not 
done! While those are impressive accomplishments for a turntable crew, 
ILL INSANITY looks at that time period as preparation for what we're 
about to do from here on. It's about to get really serious!"

Their live show consists of a group performance, individual turntable 
solos and all around party rocking. Three hours of non-stop turntable 
theatrics by three of the best DJs in the game.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

Fri Nov 14                       KRAFTY KUTS                     Pittsburgh

Krafty Kuts, can truly be recognised as a member of the breakbeat elite. 
And along with other high profile figures such as Adam Freeland, Rennie 
Pilgrem, Freq Nasty and the Plump DJs, Krafty Kuts has been instrumental 
in pushing the breakbeat sound to a world-wide audience.

In 2006 in released the critically acclaimed .Freakshow. album on 
Against The Grain with massive singles such as .Bass Phenomenon. with 
Tim Deluxe and .Tell Me How You Feel..

He has been voted Best International DJ at the Australian Dance Music 
Awards, the Face Of Breakbeat (2003) and Best DJ (2005 and 2006) at the 
International Breakspoll Awards, Best Breaks DJ at the M8 awards (2006) 
in Ibiza, Best Mini Mix on Annie Mac.s radio 1 show. These continue to 
be great accolades for his efforts. However, this success didn.t come 
overnight.

Krafty Kuts. first ventures on the wheels of steel occurred in the mid 
80.s when he was bitten by the hip-hop and electro bug. It was during 
this period that he developed his cutting and scratching skills, which 
are now a trademark of his party rocking sets.

While Krafty Kuts was smashing it with his DJ skills, he also found time 
to release his own music. In 1996 he was signed to FSUK, one of the 
Ministry Of Sound.s offshoot labels. 3 EP.s were released to critical 
acclaim, as well as .Gimme The Funk.; a one-off release for Fatboy 
Slim.s label Southern Fried that was hammered by every DJ worth their 
salt.

The success of these releases led to Krafty Kuts becoming one of the 
most highly demanded remixers within the UK dance music scene. Today, 
the list of people Krafty Kuts has remixed for reads like an who.s who 
of the music world, including the likes of Jurassic 5, Utah Saints, Dead 
Prez, Fatboy Slim, Afrika Bambaata, Arthur Baker, Eric B & Rakim and the 
Classic .Humanoid. by Stakker Humanoid. His remixing talents were 
cemented at the 2003 International Breakspoll Awards, where he won Best 
Remix for Afrika Bambaataa.s .Funky Heroes..

As well as dishing out killer remixes, he.s also managed to compile 
.Slam The Breaks On. 1 & 2, both classic overviews of the breakbeat 
sound. Look out for his Fabric Live mix CD coming soon.

Whilst producing and remixing, Krafty Kuts also managed to maintain his 
Djing commitments the world over, playing alongside such luminaries as 
Fatboy Slim, The Freestylers, Jungle Brothers, Scratch Perverts, Roni 
Size and Armand Van Helden.

At present, Krafty Kuts is enjoying success in many areas. To date, his 
music has been used for a Coca-Cola advert, Playstation 2 and PS3 games 
and for Guy Ritchie.s film .Mean Machine.. His club night Supercharged, 
co-promoted with fellow breakbeat crusader Skool Of Thought, is still 
rammed every week and is widely regarded by many of the scenes big 
players as having been instrumental in pushing the breakbeat sound to a 
wider audience.

about

E-SIX & ROAN ( FIRST LIVE A/V DUO )
Emerging from scenes seemingly worlds apart though identical in passion, 
virtuosity and cultural influence, Emilio Abadia and Matt Roan form what 
is possibly the most innovative and engaging DJ duo to infiltrate the 
Windy City. A drive to isolate, capture, cut-up and then synthesize 
moments of both sonic and visual art mark the experience of one of their 
performances. Their sets, which are as meticulously curated as a gallery 
show and involve DVD clips edited to a click track, have resulted in a 
very respected event: Dance Party Magic, produced under the banner of 
their company Crossfader King. In individual sets, Abadia, known as 
E-Six, and Roan bring elements of their divergent musical backgrounds to 
the fore, adding unique options to Chicago clubbers apart from their 
visual and audio mash-ups. Each a relentless selector, E-Six and DJ Matt 
Roan are the perfect purveyors of your party experience.

Originally hailing from Daytona Beach, Florida, E-Six was a prominent 
promoter in the post-punk and hardcore rock scenes. He simultaneously 
absorbed many other musical movements of the time, including electronica 
at old-school raves, dirty South hip-hop, Miami bass and the more 
slickly produced sounds of beachside clubs. This schizophrenic 
appreciation resulted in what E-Six calls his .rock-any-kind-of-crowd 
music,. melding original remixes, bass-drenched club rap, electronic 
bangers, rock gems, .80s and .90s breaks and international underground.

Chicago native Roan got his chops in the classically trained realm, 
studying piano, guitar and drums from the age of eight onward. Four 
indie records, a stint at Lollapalooza and several club residencies 
later, his beat master prowess has surpassed the various DJs he watched 
in awe at the Northside Puma store he once managed. By teasing 
partygoers with a carefully constructed wall of atmospheric choices from 
across the map, E-Six and DJ Matt Roan are a club experience akin to 
champagne and truffles at an abandoned warehouse party: completely 
unexpected.

DETROIT TECHNO MILITIA
2x4 DJ Seoul & T.Linder
[www.detroittechnomilitia.com]
-2008 Rustbelt Tour-

Detroit Techno Militia is a record label and a grass roots DJ/Producer 
collective dedicated to preserving the legacy of true Detroit electronic 
music and its proliferation around the world.

Similar to the restoration of historic architecture; we are not tearing 
down and building anew. Rather using the existing structure as a basis 
for our own endeavors. Detroit has always had much to offer musically 
and it is our mission to make it known to the rest of the world for 
generations to come.

As owner and co-founder of Bang Tech 12, DJ Seoul has been tearing up 
the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule that 
has taken him to literally thousands of events across North America. 
Including the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, which he considers a 
career highlight.

Here are some links to listen to some tunes as well:
