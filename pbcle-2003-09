Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} Mazi mix

Okay...We posted two hours of Mazi's August 9 Summer Series set (2 of 4.5
hours). Sorry for the distortion on the recording...He got to cranking that
hour of the night. Regardless, it should be an enjoyable trip down memory
lane for those who were there. (And a swift kick in the ass for those who
missed it).

I can't wait.  Depending on the semester and what its going to look like I

They are both the dons of dnb and I can't wait to see what they drop.

saw Armin here in Chicago and was very disappointed.
Played lots of non-melodic prog and "bangin" techno.
Thing is the muscleheaded guys in the audience loved
it.  I'm starting to be in the minority as a lover of
uplifting trance.  Yukk.

I didnt catch that #5 dj in the world part last time, but that makes me 
more interested. You think Armins gonna tear it up Invisble Piklz style 
or someting!? Fuck, anyways, what is with all these headliners doing 
their fall tours around here? Sensory overload...makes up for the fact 
that raves are dead, I tell you.

Hey pal, this is PITTSBURGH - CLEVELAND raves, not MICHIGAN raves.  Try
posting this to mw-raves instead.

just kidding, James -- I felt the need to bust your balls about something
(even if it isn't entirely appropriate since ann arbor really isn't very far
away).

No.... I was pointing out the the Necto is in Ann Arbor Michigan.  And I was
JOKING just to poke at James a little.  Necto is doing some cool shit from
what i hear... all the way around the dance community!   As for Armin Van
Buuren in Columbus --- right the fuck on!  That's a real treat for a lot of
people (moreso than others I can think of) and based on how Ritual did on
sunday, Van Burren will be off the hook!

L-E-V-I-T-Y.... joshing... good old fashioned kidding around amongst
friends.... does anyone remember what that is?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Armin Van Buuren.... finally

i posted it originally cause for the past 2 years whenever the post was made
"who would you want to see" always on my list was armin van buuren.  granted
it's trance, but i think the guy is by far the best trance dj in the world
when listening to his track selection on all his mix cd's.  the guy doesnt
just play perfecto or bedrock tracks or anything really all that 'money
driven' in the genre, imho.  it's just funky ass shit that i want to
experience live.

-nick bradford

ps has anyone actually picked up on the nick bradford reference other than
those that asked me what the hell it meant and i then explained it to them?

No need to stick up for yourself... I wasn't talking about your post :)

I'll even refrain from the trance comments because I really _do_ think AVB

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Armin Van Buuren.... finally

i know you werent talking about my post... i was just trying to reiterate
why i started the thread, and it wasnt about being catty with one another...
i'm beginning to think this rainy summer has caused a role reversal of the
normal seasons and when cabin fever actually happens... so many people have
been on edge (myself included ref: sauce) about bitching/'discussing' their
opinions.. lol... it's all in good fun... i just got home from the south
side seeing jwan and curt and 15 minutes of the josh's for some quality
music on a wednesday night (sorry to bbt and spi for no goose
representation, just i was feeling the electro tip tonight)... so my message
is now 'go out young men (and women) and support your local scene as well as
others covered in the "4 hours driving distance from youngstown, oh"
category.

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

For those trance lovers out there, here is an upcoming
event in September that you won't want to miss...

Friday.September.05.2003 

TEMPORAL RHYTHM PRESENTS, 

DUMONDE - JamX & DeLeon - Germany 
www.dumonde.de 

Germany's Dumonde joined the mounting embrace of
trance culture in the late 90s with a stormer of a
track. Created by Jurgen Mutschall (Chaos Records
handler and better known as DJ Jam X) and Dominik de
Leon (aka DeLeon) their debut single entitled
Tomorrow" hit Germany's Top Ten in 1999 and in no
time a staggering amount of record labels scrambled to
get their track on their compilations. Dumonde's
animated synths and refined sound continued to push
the envelope with their remixes for Push, Alice
Deejay, and Barthezz. Their rising DJ popularity was
assisted with follow-up singles including "See the
Light", "Never Look Back", "Memory" and this year,
"Human" & "Atmosphere". 

They have held the most prestigious residency in
Germany at the world-famous 'Dorian Gray", had gigs at
'Glow' in Washington DC, 'Velfarre' in Tokyo and have
headlined massive European dance events such as the
Love Parade, "Nature One", Trance Energy and
Godskitchen Global Gathering. 

Making their Canadian debut, this is one talented
producer / DJ duo that you do not want to miss!

 SUMMARY
 Doormouse and Baseck are back to their scheming ways,  and back
 on tour following last spring's Gangstabass Inc fiasco.  Doormouse
 promises a whole new live set...and his shit is getting  weirder and more
 "live" every time, mixing hardcore/breakcore,  jazz, deathmetal, booty,
 spoken word and strange humor.  Baseck has been rocking
 spots from LA to Milwaukee to all over europe pretty much on
 the constant.   Insane cuts and scratches with equally insane beats.
Strangely
 enough both of them have mix cds coming out on Tigerbeat 6 shortly,
 shorty.  Coming along this time is Stuntrock.  If you've ever
 had your heart ripped out, you need to check out his REGRET CD/ZINE,
its a brilliant "self help" concept album about getting over fucked
relationships.
 Stuntrock live is a whole nuther thing...that you really need to
 see understand.  And this time he's doing half PA, and half stand-up
 comedy.  Opening up are some younger acts - Hearts of Darknesses -
 who has made a bit of a name for himself with some crazy live antics,
 and has a forthcoming full length on Schematic records - playing off of
Pittsburgh's
 own Girltalk, who comes off somewhere between Kid606 and Cex.
 Also as a special guest we've got Drop the Lime from NYC coming in -
 he's really set to start blowing things up with a crazy style of
 mutant 2step, electro and breakcore, and an impending 12" on ambush.
 To round it out, Wrecked Soundsystem...made up of cutups and whatever
 other locals can muscle in some tunes dropping booty jams, electro, acid,
 rock, hiphop, noise, and weirdness.  So come out, shake your ass,
 get your circle pit on, or chill to some hot jams, tea and videogames
 at the Shadow Lounge.

National Protest to Protect the Rights of the Dance Music Culture

We are proud to announce that ROAR!, The National Dance and Music Rights 
Alliance, is sponsoring a nationwide protest against the RAVE Act and 
similar attacks on the dance music scene. The protest is being held on the 
Upper Senate Park directly off Constitution Ave between New Jersey NW and 
Delaware Ave NE, directly North of the US Capitol Building, from noon to 
midnight. All members should attend and show their support! Details below.

The US Government has declared a War on Music. We are the target of busts, 
arrests, harassment and intimidation, all with the ultimate goal of 
destroying our culture and silencing the music we love. The recently 
passed RAVE Act threatens to scare club owners and promoters into shutting 
down events nationwide for fear of imprisonment of up to 20 years and/or 
fines of $500,000. Even harsher laws sit in Congress right now.

This summer, join ROAR! for a demonstration against the assault on music 
and a festival for our civil liberties. We will display the force and 
unity of our culture through performances by international artists and 
speakers from major industry groups and politically influential 
organizations.

Invited Speakers:

Dennis Kucinich - 2004 Presidential Candidate, US Representative
Douglas Rushkoff - Author of Ecstasy Club, NYU

V O I G T : K A M P F F    [LIVE]

Zeropointrecords.com _ Cincinnati _ Live Drum & Bass

Emmit & Beethead, of the wildly successful Twilight Sleep orchestra, have 
formed a new force that is arguably one of the best live Drum & Bass acts

Normally associated with his peers in Techno from Detroit, Europe and
elsewhere in the US and the world, John Tejada has embraced electronic
music as a personal frontier, expanding on his formidable resume as a
Techno recording artist as producer and remixer, DJ, and label owner. With
dozens of singles, remixes, some film and TV work and contributions to
sample CDs to his credit, this recent expansion has born a slew of tracks
deeply informed by his uncompromised aesthetic honed over years of
diligent production which finds its roots in Detroit Techno but references
a far broader range of music, both in and outside of electronic music. His
musically formative years were steeped in Classical music, growing up in
family of performing artists--his mother a soprano singer and his father a
conductor which then widened to include hip hop, DJing and finally,
electronic music.

Known for crafting a brand of subtle, musical techno, his recorded output
ranges across tempo and genre lines, from chilled out affairs with
spacious arrangements to pulsating, densely layered, deeply energetic
tracks that work magnificently in the hands of DJs as well as on the home
stereo.  Earlier on, his music found release on labels such as A13,
Multiplex and Generation R&S. Following on to those successes, he
established his own imprint, Palette, in Los Angeles, in 1996, and has
enjoyed seven years of steady growth and recognition. The label has served
as an exclusive outlet for his own prodigious output but has recently
begun to expand its roster.  He has also continued to record for other
labels such as Plug Research, Seventh City, Moods and Grooves, deFocus,
Sino and others, often in collaboration with 12 year long collaborator
Arian Leviste, and alongside these numerous singles, has also produced
eight albums; two for A13, Palette and one each for deFocus, Plug
Research, Moods and Grooves and Playhouse.  John's Cleveland shows are
always amazing events and we expect nothing less from him this time.

Warm Art is a global experiment dedicated to entertaining and educating
world dancefloors with the intelligent sides of techno, house, electro,
and experimental beats.  The Warm Art collective contains djs and
producers located throughout the world, including Atlanta, Chicago,
Cleveland, Los Angeles, Seattle, London, Norway, and Dubai.  Abbasso
Underground Lounge in Cleveland hosts Warm Art on the second saturday of
each month.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

i posted it originally cause for the past 2 years whenever the post was made
"who would you want to see" always on my list was armin van buuren.  granted
it's trance, but i think the guy is by far the best trance dj in the world
when listening to his track selection on all his mix cd's.  the guy doesnt
just play perfecto or bedrock tracks or anything really all that 'money
driven' in the genre, imho.  it's just funky ass shit that i want to
experience live.

ps has anyone actually picked up on the nick bradford reference other than
those that asked me what the hell it meant and i then explained it to them?

one of these instead...that is if it isn't too much more expensive.

the way i look at it, technics know what the deal is with becoming
the industry standard turntable. if anyone is going to drop
something that i would think will be around for years, it would be
them. so even if it is more expensive initially (im sure it will
be, cdj1000s have been out for over 2 years now i think) im sure
it will be worth waiting for. a full size direct drive cd
controlling platter is exactly whats up. it should feel just like
using a 1200, and with better control and less skipping than a
regular TT or final scratch.

I see this as being one expensive mofo, and I am intrigued by how it might 
work. Please update the list if anyone sees anything.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} youre almost there, guys

yeah, that's a start.  since i can buy a decent dvd movie for around that 
price (or 2 or 3 lesser known titles).

this is a risk for universal, but one that needs to be taken.  if it 
doesn't work at this level, it will be a long time before any other company 
will try it.  i still think that $9.98 would be a fair price and one i'd 
pay rather than hunting for a copy, but $12.98 isn't awful.

i've long believed that reducing the price of music cds would spur sales... 
just hope i'm right.

$10 is definitely the price that would have me buying CDs alot
more frequently. however this is still definitely good news. im
assuming the other big cats wont let this go unanswered, so
eventually we might see some real price competition and actually
get to around that $10 level. im pretty sure this price reduction
will work out fantastically for them. i can remember working at
Music X in 99 when we raised the prices up to the $17 or so that
it was. Godsmack's first album was out and there was a couple
month long special where you could pick it up for like $10. we
sold so many copies of that piece of shit that it was insane.

Subject: {pb-cle} Annabelle's


Annabelle's was off the hook last night. This 
is the first time I have had the chance to 
make it out there. I don't usually go out on
work nights anymore, but last night was worth
the hangover! I was pleasantly suprised. 
There were alot of old school headz out, Mike 
Love, Nox, Zacharia to name a few. I saw alot
of new faces also. Just goes to show you that
if you book good dj's and keep it cheap, people
will come out. The place filled up pretty nicely.
It had that Avenue/Lazy gator vibe. 

Boompsie and Majestic tore shit up as usual. 

Peace n skillet grease,
Luke

unfortunately i think they need to get some better stuff on those 12.98$ 
discs.   i haven't really seen any new stuff worth pirating, let alone 
buying.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR - clean your machines, damnit!

    ok, someone (some people) have this damn sobig
    virus and they need to clean their machine(s).

    i'm obviously in someone's address book because
    it's being sent from my account.

    i'm getting loads of bounces from other addresses on
    the infected machines, not to mention lots of emails
    with the virus.

    not sure what the proper method for checking /
    cleaning your machine is, but it's worth doing it
    if you haven't done so yet.

    it's someone rave related, due to the bounced
    messages.

    trout just told me there were new versions of this
    virus out.

    anyway. it would be cool if you would fix your
    machine if you have the virus.

    otherwise, i hope it does some really horrible stuff,
    as i am tired of getting the bounces.

    i am cranky this morning. grrr...

    so, fix your fucking machine, and if you think it's a
    good idea to open email that says: your application,
    thank you, movies, etc - fucking don't. i don't know
    if you need to open the email or attachment, but don't
    do either!

    a link: http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/w32sobigf.html

    evidently this thing kills itself on september 10, 2003.
   
    i can't wait to see what they come up with next.

Cuffed - Trouser Downsizing Threatens Raver Industry
Source: http://www.theonion.com/NEW YORK -- As trouser downsizing continues throughout the troubled economy and budget cuts threaten employees' pants security, many workers in legwear-based fields have come to fear the worst. But though trouser downsizing affects virtually all Americans, the hardest hit are those in the country's $2.1 billion domestic raving industry, who depend on trouser size for their very survival. Trouser downsizing for them is no mere media buzzword, but a serious threat to their way of life."Without dope-ass phat gear, I will not be able to rave nearly as effectively as I have done in the past," said Minneapolis-area raver Mark the Phonky Alien, whose overall trouser volume has decreased more than 40 percent in the last six months due to fabric cutbacks. "I cannot drop crazy, low-end bass, I cannot freak the turntables, and I cannot put food on the table for my family. It's that simple."All across America, an increasing number of raving-industry workers are
 afraid of losing their pants watching helpless as their trousers continue to decrease in size. Many have been forced to endure cuffs that stop short of the foot, leaving the entire top of the shoe exposed.In some of the worst-hit areas, such as New York's SoHo andGreenwich Village, massive denim shortages have cause the price of oversized pants to nearly triple. Many of these New York ravers, unable to afford the high prices, have actually been forced to abandon their dope, oversized Fuct and Alien Workshop-brand gear altogether, trading them in for humiliatingly narrow $30 Levi's "slim fits.""Phat-ass gear is going the way of the dinosaur, and no one in the society at large seems to be doing anything about it," said out-of work Chicago raver DJ Free MDMA, 20, whose straight-leg jeans barely even sag at the crotch."Just look at me. I look ridiculous, It hurts to admit it, but I've even started wearing khakis on weekdays, just to make ends meet." "They're Dockers," he added 
 tearfully. "They're even pleated." Raving-industry insiders say the situation is only going to get worse."Unchecked, unregulated trouser growth throughout the early '90s resulted in a rate of denim use that simply could not sustain itself," said Anson Farber of  Princeton's Institute For Trouser Studies. "Trouser mergers throughout the decade, in which as many as three or four pants worth of fabric were combined into a single pair of trousers, created an unstable leg-width situation that continues to this day. A collapse ofthe nation's drastically overinflated pants was inevitable."According to Farber, by as early as 1998 we may being seeing ravers in shorts.DJ Freek Malik, who spins Friday nights at Miani's famed Club 808, has mounted an effort to fight back. Collecting fabric donations from every available source, Malik's organization, PhatNow!, is attempting to provide trouser relief for Miami-area ravers, adding desperately needed volume to their pants.But even Malik admits it
 is an uphill climb. "A lot of raversuse their pants to provide a place to crash for friends who've been kicked out of their parents' houses," he said. "What are they supposed to say? 'I'm sorry, but my pants just aren't big enough for the both of us anymore, I'm kicking you out on the street'?""It's sad," Malik added, sighing. "Many of these kids have had no choice but to give up raving altogether and try to find work elsewhere, often as goths."Yet despite the hardship, many ravers remain optimistic about the future. "I hear there's gonna be a big rave in Phoenix this weekend," said Brianna Dunham, 18, a Tempe, AZ, raver. "This one guy Dean's got a car. We're all going. I can't wait."Sadly, that's all the nation's ravers can do -- wait. And hope that trouser downsizing won't ultimately leave them high and dry.

I knew a guy that owned like 2 but sold them. Soccer and Techno are 2 
of the BIGGEST things that dont sell in this country.
If u come down into Strongsville, there WAS a Sweeneys soccer just past 
RT 82 (royalton rd) if ur heading south down pearl rd (42). It was in a 
shopping center on the left behind Chipolte, but that was like a year 
ago. Cant say if its stil open.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} all i can say is "hhhhmmmmmm"

	Pimps don't come in boxes you buy at Kmart. Pimping is a state of 
mind. All guys WANT to be a pimp, but half dont even know what it is. 
Then if they found out, would they still cheat on their "precious" 
girlfriends. Wussy's. Who came first, the chicken or the egg? Neither! 
The guy did. Well that's according to pimpn.
	 That "how too be a pimp" thing is close, but no fucking cigar. 
Modifying attraction is in most ways out of a guys reach, ala being 
famous, rich, good looking. But something that everyone can control is 
being Cocky and Funny. Simple as fucking that- if combined properly. 
Think about it, guys, and you'll know what I mean.

Other helpful tips...
-get numbers and get out...dont linger and try get laid on the 1st 
meeting, it makes u look desperate, and unless she's trashed, you just 
won't
-be manly, talk like one, modify ur voice a little
-be confident...if u think ur not gonna get some girls number, u 
probably wont ...sorry bud

pimp yah later,
alex

it's true, but i must say, in america it's not so much
the product as the marketing that matters.

It was either that or Walt Disney. But of course we haven't quite 
brought back him back from the dead, so I didn't want to get everyone 
in a gloomy mood.

Yah, Ed, correkt. Be sure to stock up on shells, on sale now, complete 
in every color and several themes. The raver one has blinking lights 
and plays ambient Drum and Bass for a "soothing and relaxing" 
experience.

Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Please come out to WRUW's 22nd Annual Studio-A-Rama this Saturday.
 
Studio-A-Rama is WRUW's annual FREE concert.
 
The music is great all day - hardcore to hip hop to indy to 
electronic to jazz...
 
Studio-A-Rama takes place near the corner of Mayfield and Euclid in 
the Mather Memorial Courtyard.
 
Surf to http://www.wruw.org <http://www.wruw.org/>  for more info and a
map.
 
Not to miss is Infinite Number of Sounds...
 
Infinite Number of Sounds goes on at 9:15pm.  They are a four piece 
electronic music band - drums, bass, electronics, and a video 
projectionist.  Their beats are tight and they sound fantastic. 
Their video show is as much a part of their performance as the music. 
They know how to do a video show and they do it well.
 
We usually get 800-1000 people for the show and the vibe is good...
 
The sound system is pro and will bump...
 
You can bring your own coolers...
 
Bring your ID if you want to drink...
 
DO NOT BRING GLASS BOTTLES...
 
I am the Director of the event...Please come out and show your 
support...Scene Magazine wrote that Studio-A-Rama is one of 
Cleveland's best music concerts...If you haven't been, now is the 
time!
 
-Calvin

good stuff happen this week.  Also wanted to check out that wruw

Subject:  {pb-cle} Studio-A-Rama

Not technically a rave, but an outdoor music event held anually at CWRU's
campus.  It's this Saturday.  I wouldn't have known about the date myself
except I'm on the mailing list for Lords of the Highway.  It's usually
earlier in the season than this.

The talent is pretty diverse this year, from electro to alt-country.  Bring
beer, don't bring glass bottles.

http://www.wruw.org/studioArama/

I'm not affiliated, just a fan.

and if you do bring beer or what-have-you, bring some ID, just in case.

I concur that it's a really good event.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Last night @ Havana

Tom -- good stuff last night, enjoyed the krikor record drop as 
usual... if anyone was there and noticed any 'tom cox 
trainwrecking', I was near the decks most of the night and the 
left deck would just randomly jump needle, so for those of you on 
the patio that mentioned 'groaning and grimacing', it was not the 
dj's fault, except for the fact that he didnt play broken beat 
house.  I had a great time as usual, thanks Jason, thanks Mike, 
thanks Tom.  

And ever since last night, I've had 'you dropped the bomb on me' 
stuck in my head... thanks tom.

Still the most amazing thing that I've kept on pondering is... 
Would Tom Cox from 4 years ago call you a crazy lunatic if you 
told him that he'd be spinning deep soulful house in 2003?

i have no idea why but even the 5 of us that live
within a 2 mile radius of each other just all show up
solo knowing that if others aren't there yet, they
will show up sooner or later.

toms set was really good last night!  total Kudos to
him! i also wouldn't have minded hearing some broken
beat but his selection last was perfect!

We invite you to attend the premiere performance of
Sing-a-long Wizard of Oz on September 25th...all

Persad, for those of you who dont know, is a great
foundation here in pittsburgh. One of few of its kind
in the United states.  they do the big Art for AIDS

you can come dressed like characters from the movie
and there are drag queens there that look amazing. 
Last year they did the sound of music. its a lot of
fun to say the least.  anyway.  just FYI!

2 mile radius?  it's like < 1 mile between me, celeste, you, tom, 
kelly d, tom, akeel, colin, etc... there are so many of us that 
live RIGHT THERE that I know of, and more that I probably just 
dont know about.

Things change, man.  Life is crazy like that.  Liz Janco crocheted this
gorgeous blanket for Kingston when he was born.  Tom looked at it and said,
"If a year ago you told me that Liz Janco would be making a blanket for the
son I was having with Kelly Delaney, I would have looked at you like you
were on crack."
Change can be good.

make tall pauls too:)

Andre Leon and Jamie Tyler will be spinning a mix of
minimal techno, funky tech-house, and whatever else we
feel like dragging out of the bag.

yeah man, there were a couple times i couldnt even keep the needle
in the groove when cueing. it was killing me, worst of all on the
mix into that Dells edit. the needle even jumped around a bit in
the middle of that fantastic track, i had to mix out quickly.
argh, i dont know what was up with that. 

>And ever since last night, I've had 'you dropped the bomb on me' 
>stuck in my head... thanks tom.

man, i keep getting all different tracks that i played stuck in my
head. like every vocal tune i played has such great melodies.
right now im jumping between "love is the message" and "u bring me
vibes" in my head but last night it was "let no man put asunder"
and "is it all over my face".

i dont even know what id have said. im sure i would have been
happy knowing that people would actually dance when i played
records......

the best set
>i have ever heard from him.

thanks alot, i appreciate it. its weird cause im still kind of
learning as i go along with mixing up all the different genres ive
been playing. i think the first time i ever spun a set that wasnt
all drum and bass or all garage was last august (at havana
actually). so i think in the last year ive come along with the
style im trying to develop pretty well, especially considering how
infrequently i actually get to play records in front of people. 
and getting to play 2 hours is the bomb, even though i could have
played 3 or 4 with all the ill records i brought with me : )

I heard about this on Tuesday from my boss.  I grew up about 20 minutes away 
from Mt. Hope in Dalton, OH (Wayne County).  If my car got pelted with tomatoes 
by some Amish hoodlums, I would seriously get out and kick their asses, but I 
wouldn't have killed anybody.  Not to brag, but I have over 10 years experience 
with Martial Arts.  Those Amish can be quite the rebels.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: things slow in OH?

Remember the Amish kid that got arrested for trafficking cocaine?

They kick it.

I talked to some ex-amish kids that became "worldly." They told me youths 
often party straight through for a couple days on the weekends, and that 
lots of sexual impropriety happens, because they want you to get it out of 
your system. Once you get married, and grow that beard, you have to have 
responsibilities that simply must be adhered to if you want to stay in the 
faith.

Pretty good way to be if you ask me. Although I know plenty of guys who 
simply never got that sort of thing out of their system. Married or not.

Judge Jules Condemns Greedy Superstar DJs

At least four of the world's top ten DJs are bumping up their fees by =
forcing international promoters to offer auction style bids for their =
services, Judge Jules revealed this week. =20

"One leading progressive DJ would rather stay at home not DJing if he =
can't get a=20
=A310-15,000 fee, and regularly sits at home on a Saturday as a =
consequence," said Jules.

"He should hang up his headphones with an attitude like that. I love my =
job so=20
much I'd still be doing this if it was only to 25 people."

"Whilst I'm tempted to name names, I hope that the guys in question take =
a long hard look at themselves," he added.

 "What did they get into this business for in the first place?"

Jules' press agents, meanwhile, announced a series of upcoming dates for =
the Radio 1 jock including South Africa, China, the USA, and the =
Freshers' student ball at Leeds University (UK).

yes john gannon is a master with 3 decks and he'll definitely kill it, but i'm looking forward to adam jay's live pa! his 2 hr. live pa at the tronic afterparty in detroit this year was simply amazing. he's been my favorite producer since he released intimate voyeur machine on zync last year. his tracks infect me like a dirty needle washed up on the shores of lake erie. 
 
i talked to tim xavier yesterday and he told me that he is going to show ohio what hard techno can do to a dance floor, BOOM!!! he's going to have a lot of his newer tracks that haven't even come out yet and a lot of white labels. be prepared!!! 
 
my boys dustin and ian(the attack people) will also be playing some new tracks in their live pa. they bring it hard! 
 
of course we know that randy has skills behind the decks!!!
 
are you going mike? it'll be cool to see you, it's been a while.
 
MIDWEST TECHNO REPRESENT!!!!!!!!!

Yea its  true  amish   kids  can  party down like no other.One of my friends 
was  amish  but decided to  leave the  church now  he makes more money than  
most of  us running an  amish taxi service.After all they  cant  themselves 
drive but theres nothing  wrong with somebody else driving them around.And  on 
fridays when  they get their  tax free paychecks he also runs  quite the black 
market in beer and other off topic stuff.The  best part about being amish is 
when your too drunk  to drive your   buggy home it really does not matter 
because the horse knows the way!!!

Subject: {pb-cle} back from vacation / phunktified

I'm back from vacation.  I just glanced at the archives, Jeez I'm
glad I missed all that drama (even though I guess some was involving me
and my friends).

I'm listening to my recording of my set at phunktified, it sounds alright,
so I'm gonna try to get that up online in the next few days. I'm too lazy
to do a new mix cd soon anyway, so this will do.

Adam

Subject: {pb-cle} TECHNOCOLOUR

OMG!!!  Big up to this event!

I had a great time at this party.  I am glad I got to see all the good 
people from the great town of cleveland represent.  :)  Maybe one day, some 
weekend I will come up and hang out with you fine folks!

SHOUTS to the one like the alex forte, andy james, his girl lindsay and don 
lisy.  I had a great time meeting all of you.   I will definitely keep in 
touch more and try to visit one day.  BIG UPS for coming down!!

I also got the esteemed opportunity to see:
Adam Jay live for the 2176391273 time.  I <3 some adam jay style techno.  
Great live pa.
John Gannon was the DON!  I wish he could have played on 3 tables.  Oh well 
still good.
Randy dropped the bizness.  Kitsonik was great with her tag with digital 
pyskosis.  Both phenomenal phreaking djs.  I <3 breaks.  Vinny bricks was a 
great treat as well, man dropped the hotness.  Mike Donovan of course didn't 
disappoint.  GREAT HOUSE MUSIC!  I wish I could have stayed and represented 
more your set was getting good.... I will come out next time and see you 
rock the spot again.  Great music selection.  Marea of course played the 
TUNES!  Titonton played the best set I have ever seen him do.  The attack 
people attacked.  That last track they played was nice.  Their whole set was 
insane.  <insert adjective here>  ISS of course were the DONS!  RAGGGAAA!!!!

I really am not a fan of two room parties because I always miss something.  
But oh well, its all good.  To me the best night is a club even with only 4 
djs and 1 headliner or maybe less...  regardless I still had a good time and 
met a TON of good people!

Big up subsonik, randy and jomama for all the good work you guys do!  I had 
FUN!

Thanks again!
steve

Subject: {pb-cle} maataa mandaara 3 pix and review

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/maataa_mandaara_3

ummm, i don't know what to say about some of those pix, so i wont.


ummm, it was cold and wet, but not as bad as field day!!!  managed to 
stay warm and dry mostly.

headed down with luke and aaron in aarons minivan, total ghetto 
styleeeee, no back seat, just used a camping chair to sit in.....   wheeeee!

we get down to WV 9-10ish?  i forget exactly, it was dark and out on 
those oh so famous windy mountain roads like going to the full moon 
gatherings.  ugggg, we get there, no signs no nothing.  noone seemed to 
know where to check in at, we finally drove around for prolly 30 mins on 
gravel roads till we figured out the building, checked in and tried to 
find the camping area....  big ass field on a mountainside sorta.
pitched the tent and ran into old skool listie mike colbert and met some 
of lukes russian friends from jersey, and their friends. 

stage is a bunch of fluro backdrops and other fluro stuff, nice small 
clean sound system.  lots of goa.  till 11am.  i konked out kinda early, 
just too wet and cold to get into much.

saturday our mission was food..... wandered into moundsville and found a 
wendys (i was leaning towards some local pizza, but don't think anyone 
else wanted the gamble you can get with an unknown mom-n-pop pizza shop)

ran into dan sidetrakkt and some of his crew for a bit, didn't talk a 
whole lot, i figured i'd catch up with him later and never really did.  
ended up chilling alot with meghan and sid here and there. hadda keep 
warm in aarons van and near the campfire....  ohhh, i gotta explain 
aarons idea of roughing it......

a tent the size of a sherman tank, a PORTASHITTER for campers, a fridge 
powered off the van, a TEEVEE for football in case he hadda watch it 
there....  he drove down to the stage and parked right next to the 
stage.  ended up being a wise choice, as we could camp in the van with 
heat and still see and hear everything.

lots of crazy muzak, lots of crazy dancers, and people playing with all 
sorts of odd fluro stuff.  fun stuff to watch.  ended up being a dance 
floor killer type for awhile. plopped my chair right down near the 
speakers/djs/pas and camped there for awhile with luke and others.  

so anyhow, it was hellla fun, got to hang out with the ohio cru and meet 
the jersey crew and their russian friends.  those crazy russians, i 
dunno what it is, but every one i have met is a screwball????  anyhow, 
they invaded our site for awhile, then i guess tore off in a huge ass 
SUV around the field looking for the exit and couldn't find it.   didn't 
actually see THAT, but i can imagine the mess??

anyhow, we hadda leave early sunday morning SO LUKE AND AARON COULD 
WATCH FREAKN NLF OPENING DAY.  gah.  use a vcr.  though i noticed aaron 
had a hard time getting motivated enough to get in the drivers seat!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} TECHNOCOLOUR

	Yes, this was indeed a good party. Not the biggest and baddest, but 
the music was soooo fucking sweet it didn't really matter. Nice thing 
they got going down in Cincy, and this Pulse nightclub was an 
interesting looking venue. Even with cops patrolling around inside and 
out, I felt so safe and snug. Right. Couldnt even blaze one. Hah.
	To sum this one up, I went down with Ethan Brown of the list, and this 
being his first ohio party, I tried swaying over to the techno and dnb 
side and away from his progressive tip,  all on the whole way down and 
back with nothing but killa live mp3 sets.  I've feel all this 
pulverized the kids brain with more techno in one night than some1 
should be dosed for their first time. Its kewl, all in good sport.
	  When we got to the party and after getting through security so tight 
i thought I was boarding a plane, we scoped out the venue. Bumped into 
Andy James, Lindsay, Don Lisy, and Stephen Wiggins as well later. All 
kewl headz and pleasure chilling with them throughout the night. Well 
not long after we arrived, John Gannon stepped up and played a great 
sample set of the rest of the night. All the other mainstage acts from 
12-4 were awesome fucking techno with some flawless mixing (sadly only 
2 turntables, indeed) (included Adam Jay, Tm Xavier, React/randy, and 
that other live PA duo?). At 4 Titonton came on and had the dancefloor 
packed funky break beat stylee faster than you can say his name. That 
guys really nice and truly an entertainer behind the decks. Despite 
only being able to see like the 1st 20 min of his set, since I was way 
to tired to linger, so we left. Feel the need to mention sound and 
lights. Lighting was a decent setup in the mainroom with scanners and 
moving heads (blinking pinspots on the sides of room), as well as other 
mobile dmx controlled mid sized fixtures. Sound could have been better, 
since me and don kept going up to the sound guy and giving him tips of 
how muddy stuff sounded at time (to our surprise, he was cooperative, 
ill some1 turned the levels back to what they were previously almost 
every 5 minutes). Well the side room lighting was meager...and 
sound...well, the only set I looked forward too and stayed for more 
than 15 minutes for, voight kampff, ended up coming to a halt, ONE 
INSTRUMENT AFTER ANOTHER (whoa, fucking funny but sad at the same 
time),  cuz of sound difficulties and soundguy being gone MIA. So we 
left to our dissapointment back to more crazy techno in the mainroom.
	All in all, crazy party with some good techno that won't be seen 
around here for awhile. And let's just say that I danced soo much the 
whole night, that every muscle in my body aches with pleasure now. lol.

big ups subsonik and everyone that came down and i met,
alex

p.s. Honestly, on the way back, we were titty bitty delayed both in 
columbus and somewhere else by passing up the entrance ramp to i71, so 
we had an extended trip almost.
	Well it didnt really matter since it gave us more time to  listen to 
the great mix cds from Andy and Don. We played through Andy's, then 
don's, and then i finsihed Andy's cd again as i pulled in my driveway. 
Crazy nice tune selection from both, with flawless mixing. Not to say 
one's better than the other, but Don's is pitched down a little more so 
its got a more funky dark vibe to it, while Andy's is hard and fast 
throughout (with that UNBELIEVABLE track at 51 
minutes...honestly....great song (that almost brings back some 
memories)!). So get ur hands on copy before these guys get signed and 
shipped out, and you'll end up BUYING urself a copy. muhaha

So I recorded some sets at field day and the levels were too high so 
some of the bass sounds all distorted. Is there any way to fix this?

There isn't a whole lot you can do. They source material is corrupted now. 
You can run it through some filters in Sound Forge to try and soften the 
distortion, but you can't scrub it out.

  	I dont know anything specifically for distortion, but compressors 
might help smooth it out a little,  but it will never get it perfect. 
Logic has a dither tool that helps with truncated audio for grainy 
reverb tails and stuff usually caused from monitoring at high volumes, 
but I've honestly never used it so can't say if it will work.
	 You were better off under recording (volume wise) and then 
normalizing it afterwards, but I don't blame YOU since people were 
playing at WELL OVER 0db (RED LIGHTS MEANS ITS CLIPPING<WHICH MEANS 
TURN IT DOWN OR IT SOUNDS LIKE SHITE!), so thats probably one of the 
causes of the problem. Blah, just burn em like they are.

http://ratana.chemlab.org --> mixes --> live @ phunktified

In my opinion, some of the best of this so called "soulful" dnb, all in
one set.  Normally I play more of a variety than this, but since it was
the metropol lounge it seemed fitting, and really I think it's a rare
opportunity to get to play an entire set of this stuff, but the atmosphere
there was really suited to it in my opinion.  It's also the kind of stuff
I would have played at sauce (still not sure if I am banned for life or
not).  It's not perfect, but whatever.

Lots of calibre.. including 3 tunes from the EP I was raving
about a couple weeks ago.  tracklist:

01. Calibre - Just Fine - Creative Source
02. Nu Tone - Departure Lounge - Brand Nu
03. London Elektricity - Fast Soul Music - Hospital
04. Calibre - Rejack - Creative Source
05. M.I.S.T. - Outaspace - Soul:R
06. D.Kay + DJ Lee - Pipe Dreams - 31 Records
07. Klute - Part of Me - Hospital
08. Klute - Candy Ass - Commercial Suicide
09. Klute - Now Always Forever (Calibre remix) - Commercial Suicide
10. Calibre - Hold Back - Creative Source
11. Black Rain - Tonight - Scale
12. Lil Louis - Clap Your Hands (PFM remix) - Go Beat
13. D.Kay - Devotion - Soul:R
14. Influx UK - Take My - Formation
15. Blu Mar Ten - Infected - Deep Structure
16. Mathematics - Funhouse - Frontline

I broke some self imposed rules here.. I usually dont like to play tunes
by the same artist back to back, or have too many tunes by the same artist
in one set.  but fuck it.. if only a few guys are making good stuff
currently in DNB, you have to work with what you have.

PLEASE if you get a chance to check this out, let me know what you think
of the selections... I really don't think you will find too many people
around here (unfortunately) playing them, other than still life or jea
leigh.  So I wonder if its appealing stuff, that no one plays for some
reason, or whether its not appealing and my selection is wack - either way
let me know.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} audio recording advice

the fact that the distortion is digital mean that the signal ran out of bits
to recreate the sound.  That means that the sound is gone or never recorded.
You might be able to use a tube saturation plug in to try and make the
distortion "warm" (as opposed to cold) I would suggest giving it a shot.
Try and use a expander to pull the other stuff away from the hard transient
of the kick to make sure the tube plug-in only attacks the kick or distorted
parts.  If the distortion is beyond the kick and into the rest then you
might be fucked.

Subject: {pb-cle} techno in cleveland // john tejada this saturday

i'm really excited that there seems to be some interest in bringing
techno to cleveland.  i'm working very closely with dan petrov to bring
some quality techno into cleveland.  while we're starting out with more
melodic techno and tech-house artists, we hope to mix it up and bring
some of the more experimental techno as well as the more twisted shit.
this all depends on how cleveland responds to it in the first few
months.

artists scheduled to appear in the next few months:

john tejada (los angeles | palette ,7th city, playhouse)
titonton (columbus | residual, 2000 black, bitasweet, starbaby, 7th
city, central, jesus like every label)
maetrik (texas | iron box, triebstoff, immigrant, edit, chalant,
intrinsic, morris audio)
brian aneurysm (texas | iron box, sub static)
matthew dear (detroit | plus 8, perlon, ghostly international, spectral
sound)
derek plaslaiko (detroit | detroit bachelor djs)

if all goes well you'll be seeing my all-time favorite techno
dj...probably the best techno dj in the world.  hopefully we'll get the
chance!

anyway, here's the info again for this weekend

warm art presents:

john tejada (los angeles | palette | 7th city | playhouse)

w/ mike salamon (columbus | on the floor)
dan petrov (cleveland | warm art)
adam menzies

abbasso underground lounge
below bottoms up of cleveland
1222 prospect avenue
cleveland, oh 44114
21+ please $10

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} TECHNOCOLOUR

         Well, I have no idea what to say except I had a great time. When I 
finally got back at 10am after partying or driving (well, riding) all 
night, I zombied up to my bed and didn't move until 7pm, at which time I 
woke up with a big grin on my face. Alex, you may have something with this 
techno shit *grin (please don't kill me rest of the list).
	It was nice meeting Andy James, Lindsay, and Don Lisy. Oh, and I think 
your cd scared my roommate Don - I'm enjoying it though. Forgot to grab a 
copy of Andy James', but I'll get ahold of one somewhere. If I'd had enough 
sense to read stuff here before I left then I would've known who the hell 
Stephen Wiggins was - sorry about that man. Still, everyone was cool and 
gave the fng (me) a great time, including Alex educating me on the ways off 
things techno.
	Voight Kampff was cool and put a lot of energy through the... well, the 
not-as-good second room sound system. More than it could handle probably. 
Attack People caught me on the downside, but made my body forget what time 
it was for their set. Titonton... I didn't know it was possible to have 
that much energy at 4 in the morning. Wish I could've caught the whole set 
with my mind, but my body was seriously flaking out. I'd love to mention 
some of the other guys that spun, but I was too busy dancing and looking 
around - I guess I'll just say mad props to all that spun that night! 
Thanks for making Technacolour badass.

stay away from the behringer.  they generally do not put out quality
gear.  if you have the cash to drop and only plan on using two
turntables, go with this: http://www.rane.com/ttm56.html

i use a djm 500 and i'm not very happy with the sound quality or the
lifespan of the faders.  i'm just waiting until rane comes out with a
3-channel mixer that uses that slick magnetic fader technology.  

good luck!

why do so many djs not watch their levels?  if there is not a HIRED sound guy then watch the levels and all recordings will sound fine.  just cause the red looks great with the green and yellow doesn't mean it should be like that.

Yan man, but the soundguy handles anything coming from the dj mixer, 
not BEFORE. Otherwise hat would make him the DJ. I think the levels on 
the mixer are just plain common fucking sense. If this is in regards to 
Field Day this is in a whole different  ballpark, since that was that 
party everyone was so pissed about having to keep it really low ALL of 
saturday night?

i've got a cheap Behringer 3 channel, and it serves its purpose, but 
nothing more. Very good value indeed, 200, cant beat that...but. I 
wouldn't recommend one. I don't know what your budget is, but check out 
some Heath and Allen or Vestax, or whatever you know you'll be using it 
for. But they all get kinda pricey.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixer question - hak and rane


With mixers go for sound quality before you go for gizmos.  Otherwise 
you'll be stuck with a pioneer 600 that sounds like shit when pushed but 
has "cool" fx.  If you really need fx in the future, 99% of mixers have 
an effects loop, so you can always buy a speerate fx unit that will 
sound better than the stock fx.

I really can't say enough about rane mixers and
my own mixer, the ecler hak - look it up! They are cheaper than ranes 
but sound almost as good, the quality beats most everything else I've 
heard and played on.  The price is good too.. Look up the hak 320 or 
360.  Also the rane ttm56.

I actually have a rane ttm54 with a spare power supply and crossfader 
too if anyone is interested, I might sell it. I used it for life support 
and other things where I had to bring a mixer out since it is a tank and 
sounds spectacular (my hak doesn't leave the house anymore).  2 channel, 
2  band eq with deep cuts.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} djs and levels


Since this keeps coming up, I know we were ones to push the levels in 
the red at field day.  Why?  I know this will sound dick-like, but 
because we wanted to have ANY semblance of sound coming out for people 
to hear.

At green there was simply no sound. And because we kept getting turned 
down on the board, and the subs were turned off, we had to keep 
compensating by jacking the gains.  It was sort of a ratchet effect 
because we tried to set it all green once and have it adjusted on the 
main board, but then again there was barely a peep after being turned 
down again.  All we wanted was _some_ sound since the speakers also 
served as our monitors.

So when it came down to preserving the quality of the recording and 
keeping levels in the green versus playing some music at an audible 
level in the vain hope that someone might want to dance to it, all the 
while being turned down and no subs (barely a kick drum could be heard), 
I'm sorry, but the recording loses out.

Well there is a difference between 0 sound and some sound, and we were
trying to fall inbetween that. by no means were we blasting anything....
trust me

he was talking about field day because they were talking about the
recorded sets of field day being all distorted.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} djs and levels

I didn't really notice it that night, but the night before there were 
a couple djs that at certain times jacked up the sound and it sounded 
aweful, I was walking away at one point and then whoever it was 
figured out or the sound guys fixed it or something.  Can't say if 
the levels were jacked up or if there was just something with the 
system that caused that.

I think everyone the next day was pissed that they had basically no 
sound.  Don't think they should have cut the subs completely, just 
set them really low.  Basically I would think the audio level should 
be around what I listen to music at home.  after around 100 feet it 
should be near silent, maybe a tiny ammount of bass.  

attn grammar/spelling police: yes I'm completely aware how messed up 
this email is, but my food is ready and I wanted to finish this up :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixer question - hak and rane

so i dont get why everyone slates behringer...we have no fewer than 10
different pieces of behringer gear...ranging from ultrabass pros, to
autocoms, to small mixers, headphone amps, even a 4 channel tube pre that we
use for the sound system...most of the stuff is over 3 years old...some of
it 5, some of it boxfresh...and guess what...no problems...no blown faders,
no blown pots, no distortion...nothing but what behringer advertised the
units to do...the ultrabass has been pounded on for 4 years now(by djs no
less) and it still works perfectly...the little mixers get beat on by PUNK
BANDS and live in a dusty ass basement...no problems...i think what it comes
down to with behringer is...READ THE FUCKING MANUAL...most "djs" and "remix
artists" dont RTFM and think they know what they are doing...so everything
sounds kosher for a bit...then cuz they are sending hot levels through the
unit or cuz they have the gains cranked so much on the unit it starts to
cook...or the problem could be even simpler...shitty cables or bad grounding
in the studio/field.

not to sound dickish or anything...but i dont know how many of you own or
use behringer gear...i know of 2 ppl for sure on this list that do...but if
you dont own a piece of gear dont slate it cuz you think the name is a bad
brand....i played on alex's mixer at his party and it seemed alot better
than a gemini, numark, and stanton....at the time i was playing on it, it
also seemed alot better than every rane i ever played on cuz the eq nobs
were a proper size and the headphone cue seemed a lot louder...granted it
was a pretty new unit at the time..

as for the pioneer dissing...i dont get it...their whole line seems pretty
solid...the distortion is nasty if you dont watch the meters, but that is
true on any piece of audio gear that has a - d converters...the eqs on the
pioneers are pretty nice too....everything is nice and big and clearly
marked...in fact the only complaint that is valid is the fact that the
faders do wear out...but jeez...faders will wear out, gas prices will rise,
and politicians will lie...its just a fact of life...before a few years ago,
nobody expected up faders and x faders to last more than a year and still
sound boxfresh....ppl realised that a dj mixer will take abuse and
replacement faders are a fact of life(unless you use a rotary mixer)...all
and all id rather use a pioneer mixer than any battle or 3 channel techno
mixer and most large format dj mixers with the exeception of a few ranes,
vestaxes, and heaths...but thats just my personal preference


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} maataa mandaara 3 pix and review

Yes it definitely got very cold and damp at night up in those WV mountains.  
Chris and I got down there shortly before 2:00 on Saturday afternoon.  Stupid 
me brought my camera and forgot to put film in the damn thing!!!  We mostly 
just chilled out for most of the day and didnt start dancing until about 10:00 
that night.

At one point I felt like a minority with all those Russians at our camp site, 
but it was all good. :-)

The sound and lighting were awesome!!  Definitely not as big of a crowd like at 
Gaian Mind, but still a decent turn out of Id say a little over 100 people.  
The vibe was goodwith the exception of some girl telling Aaron, Trout and 
myself to turn off the van.  She couldve been a little more nice about it, but 
instead sounded like a total bitch.  I think she may have been Kris 
girlfriend, but not 100% sure.

We left shortly after 8:00 on Sunday and got home around 11:30.

The finale was very fun.
The day was beautiful---such nice weather.  
 
I agree---that kid was the cutest thing.  And for a 2 yr. old she could dance! lol.
 
Nice job to all the DJ's---I pretty much got to hear from Jamie's set to part of Justins (Cloud 10)  and thought you all did quite well.  
 
Props to Damon for playing one of the best sets I've ever heard him lay down.
Great to see everyone.

i'd be all about a behringer if they made a
techno/battle mixer. i've never had any behringer
gear, but i've had just about everything else, and
have been disappointed by them all.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixer question

	The VMX 300 supposedly has 500 k fade cross life, and for the price, 
would seem to work out to a good deal. Nothing wrong with my mixer yet, 
but then again it gathers more dust than any exposure i give  it.
	Anyways, my Truth b2031 studio monitors are quality. No regrets about 
those babies, so just further proof that Behrinnger isnt any other 
"here today..." kind of company. I know they're more re-known for their 
crossovers and mixing consoles however.

Yeah, last night was a lot of fun.  Thank you so much Amy (nice meeting
you) and everyone else at Headrush for such a wonderful event.  The music
was great, the weather couldn't have been better, and met a lot of fun
people along the way.  Just an all around great evening!  Too bad it was
on a Sunday though, or we would have stayed all night.  I'll be looking
forward to any more upcoming events from your crew.

true in that sense but then might as well shut off the recording or do the recording from the main board that way you can control the levels to the recording while jacking up the recording for the people that wanted to dance.  if you want to run it through the main board you have to hook up recording to an aux send channel then have someone from you crew watch the recording while other people spin then your recording will be fine it won't be perfect and its kind of ghetto but it'll work.  just a little advise for everyone out there that wants to record live sets but having problems.

Since this keeps coming up, I know we were ones to push the levels in 
the red at field day. Why? I know this will sound dick-like, but 
because we wanted to have ANY semblance of sound coming out for people 
to hear.

At green there was simply no sound. And because we kept getting turned 
down on the board, and the subs were turned off, we had to keep 
compensating by jacking the gains. It was sort of a ratchet effect 
because we tried to set it all green once and have it adjusted on the 
main board, but then again there was barely a peep after being turned 
down again. All we wanted was _some_ sound since the speakers also 
served as our monitors.

So when it came down to preserving the quality of the recording and 
keeping levels in the green versus playing some music at an audible 
level in the vain hope that someone might want to dance to it, all the 
while being turned down and no subs (barely a kick drum could be heard), 
I'm sorry, but the recording loses out.

I'll vouch for the rane.  I've had mine (mp-22z) for about 4 years now.
Replaced the crossfader 1x.  Interestingly when pushed into the red, like
ALL levels maxed, it doesn't distort, thats sick.

Behringer gear used to be a lot better but they started to use manufacturing
in china and it has lowered the quality (along with price).  Older behringer
should sound and work great, they newer stuff, well I guess it depends on
"how" you use it.

The model I have is pretty old. Maybe that's why it's held up for 
so long. I know they dont even make it anymore either.

no it wasn't a refrence to field day recordings its just to say in general.  i do know there are factors that do come into play about levels i've had to have my stuff clip on the mixer before b/c sometimes people don't know how to wire stuff up or the sound guy locks the mainboard with the levels too low for no reason and you have to jack them up.  

Alex FORTE <alexforte@adelphia.net> wrote:Yan man, but the soundguy handles anything coming from the dj mixer, 
not BEFORE. Otherwise hat would make him the DJ. I think the levels on 
the mixer are just plain common fucking sense. If this is in regards to 
Field Day this is in a whole different ballpark, since that was that 
party everyone was so pissed about having to keep it really low ALL of 
saturday night?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} djs and levels

I've told people this a thousand times: Turn everything up all the way on
the mixer, and then adjust the sound (and the recording gain) to where you
want it. This way the DJ can't do any damage because she or he wants to be a
rock star.

However, it also deserves noting that people should get some decent sound
and learn how to use their equipment. Not saying anything bad about anyone
here - I wasn't at FD and don't know what kind of setup there was.

In all honesty, that's how I would do it also. But considering I 
dont know that much about sound equiptment, I wouldnt know if 
thats really the *best* way going about over sizing the gains. 
Besides, isnt red lining a mixer not so healthy for the mixer as 
well? I would think that's why the levels are on some of them.

Maybe there isn't *decent sound* because no ones used fact #1.
I can't really say that either, because there is decent sound. 
It's just some promoters wont book decent sound, because they get 
beat in money prices by the wack ones..

hmmmm.....

Subject: {pb-cle} yesterday's finale @Shooters

Thanks for the thanks everyone. It was so wonderful to meet finally the
faces and people from the list! :) Yay!

I hope everyone who played had a good time. It was our way of saying thanks
to everyone for all their support all summer...Over a couple hundred bucks'
bar tab and several community packs of cigarettes later...I hope no one left
wanting anything!  :)

I have to say it felt wonderful to be on the water and in the sun...I felt
like I was back in Miami...

It was a crazy night, particularly toward the end. Dave (aka Deviant) pushed
us over the edge with a fantastic set of techno and other goodness. During
his set, a group that was from London came in and started raising raver
hell, full-on big room style. One guy felt so empowered that after standing
in the middle of the dance floor, fists pumping and arms waving non-stop for
1/2 hour, the next level of expression he took was to drop his shorts right
in the middle of everyone, facing front to the DJ booth, arms raised in
praise. His mate ran by and finished the scene, dropping the first guy's
boxers. When the first guy raised his hands in the air again, we got the
full monty. His shirt would rise up everytime his hands waved in the air in
support of the music. I don't know how David kept it together to keep
mixing. :)

We recorded everything and will try to get the sets up soon. It's one large
file...12 hours' worth...so please be patient as we take the time to process
it. We are soooo behind with all the sets from all year...It's going to take
a while to get through everything.

Thumbs Up:
All the little children getting really into it, and props to their parents
for bringing them over to dance.

Thumbs Down:
A playa hata who took it upon himself to deliver a shitty note to Darbe
while he was trying to mix, then bolted before any of us could read it and
hunt him down. Fuck off, you jealous prick of a coward.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} djs and levels

	I don't know how this post got off track, but the reason for Paul's 
damaged sets (as far as I know most or all the ones at night time) were 
because people turned the monitor knob up. Thing was, it was connected 
directly to the pc since 500's don't have a recording out as far as I 
remember. Had their BEEN monitors that noone had brought ( I ended up 
getthing a qsc amp for them) , I would have probably just ran it from 
my board as I didn't want more cables going back and forth in fucking 
mud. Same with Paul's pc ins, i would have been better off running him 
a cable from one of my sends.
	None of the probs were caused by equipment, nor lack of knowledge of 
how it works...but bad communication and obligations that had to be 
followed cuz of risking getting shut down. This threads getting old...
consider it dead.

this all depends on how cleveland responds to it in the first few

um, im thinking that any sound rig is going to have a limiter on 
their main signal protecting their speakers. if they dont, ill bet 
that theyre idiots. i know don's system used to work like that. 
that way if you crank the gains and the master, all youll do is 
put out a distorted to hell version of the same volume level the 
limiter was set to originally.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} djs and levels

that wont solve the problem of a dj running a mixer too hot.  it clips 
in the dj mixer, and that clipping would be passed thru to the main board.
some mixers handle clipping differently, but most cheaper mixers just 
clip flat,,,,, and thats bad.
pioneers are horrible for this, they have like 1/2 their levels that run 
the red, and djs just figure well, lets hit the top of the meter.  which 
is bad. but so many don't know.  oh well.
i like don@wws' theory on it, just run compressor/limiter after the dj 
mixer, so no matter how hard they run it, it wont get louder, just 
crappier sounding, and well, thats on the dj, a mixing decision they make.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixer question - hak and rane

yeah, this it totally true.
i have an older behringer composer compressor.  thing is built like a 
tank.  i could probably drop it off a 10 floor building and it would be 
fine.  really a beefy piece of gear.  works fine for my purposes, but 
the compressor freaks say they aren't very "musical"....   guess thats 
preference.
ATOH, the new ones are flimsy junk..... i don't know if geeter center 
still has the display, but they had a 8 or 10 unit rack filled with all 
newer behringer rack gear, with 3 or 4 of them with the fronts totally 
loose and knobs rubbing on the faceplate.  all very loose knobs.
their desk mixers are cheaper than mackies, but they feel VERY flimsy. 
 i guess if you baby your gear you could get by?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} djs and levels

no, wont hurt a mixer by running in the red, or maxing it out. you would 
possibly by feeding a SUPER hot signal into the inputs, but i don't see 
that happening out of a turntable needle.  or even a cd player or tape deck.
you will clip the signal or send out a signal too hot for the input on 
the next piece of gear (next piece will clip THAT signal)...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} audio recording advice


There is a tool in Cool Edit Pro 2.0 called Clip Restoration, that magages 
to do a somewhat good job of cleaning up clipped portions of audio.  It's 
one of those tools that you really should read the manual to get the most 
out of, though.

Cool Edit also has a spectacular set of noise reduction filters.  I managed 
to clean up some turn of the century recordings so they were actually rather 
listenable.  Good stuff.. if you have access to the software, give it a 
shot.

Search through the archives and you'll find a long post of mine from =
about 2
years ago when I wrote good descriptions on all of the popular mixers =
out
now. However, here is a quick rundown:

=20

I HAVE: The Rane ttm-56

PROS:

By far the best mixer I've ever spun on. Built like a TANK. Smooth =
faders
that will last forever. (crosses fingers) AMAZING EQs (3-band) EFX loop,
LOUD headphone amp. And last but not least, RANE's customer support is =
2nd
to NONE. P:S: (Made in the USA)

=20

CONS: Pretty pricey, though.but worth it since you'll more then likely =
never
have to buy another. No XLR outputs Also, the knobs for the EQs are =
kinda
small.

=20

Before that I HAD: The Ecler HAK 320

PROS: A fantastic mixer. Amazing EQs, smooth faders, great layout, XLR
outputs, etc etc

CONS: faders are not magnetic (although I think the 360's ARE? Not sure)
Made in the UK, so you have to deal with the American distributor for
service.

=20

Before that I HAD: The Rane TTM54

Same as the 56 except you only have 2-way EQs and no magnetic faders. =
Built
like a tank.

=20

Before that I HAD: The Vestax 05pro

PROS: Great for scratching/battling

CONS: SHITTY EQs, SHTTY headphone amp, NO master Que, Was made in Japan, =
now
the 05proA is made in China.

=20

Basically, just a few things:

If you're ONLY going to scratch or battle, you can get a vestax and =
you'll
be more then happy. If you're mixing a lot and would like to use =
EQs..don't
even think about Vestax. (now, I've never spun on any of those bigger =
'club'
mixers (like the PMC-400 for example).but all the pro series' EQs SUCK.
HOWEVER, I do think the PMC-55 looks cool.especially since it has the
ability to hear the master in the headphones! (unlike it's little =
siblings
the PCV-175 and PCV-275.I HATE THOSE TWO mixers!!)

=20

Disclaimer: I REALLY like the looks of the PMC-37Pro. I would really =
like to
try one of these out.see what those filters can do. Plus, if you likes =
the
fader-EQs like the 07s have, this will be right up your alley.

=20

The 56 is probably (IMHO) the best all around mixer.for both
scratching/battling AND mixing technically.=20

=20

The 500 and 600 are DECENT mixers.but should only cost like $200-$300. =
In no
WAY are they worth what they sell for.

=20

Hope this helps a bit!

taken from the rane  ( www.rane.com ) website more at bottom:

Product Values
Integrity
 Design genuine solutions to real problems -- don't use gimmickry
 Make Rane products a great value and pleasure to use
 Publish honest specs, with honest representation by all parties
Quality & Durability
 Design & manufacture for the maximum possible quality and the longest
possible life fitting the application
 Never compromise the quality of a product for a price-point -- leave that
for the competition.
Innovation
 Make Rane products the smartest solution for each problem -- avoid
innovation for innovation's sake
 Produce better solutions by knowing the customer's needs better than the
competition
Design or Production Problems
 Never ignore or penny-pinch problems; always react quickly, decisively and
efficiently
 Fixing problems quickly ensures customer acceptance, product longevity and
lowers support costs



also email them they are happy to talk to anybody:

chrisdatrane.com just change the at to @



as for your question about quality of electronics from one manufacturer to
another,  You will need to ask a EE about that but look at any electronic
product on the market in any segment and you will notice quality products
are often over shadowed by cheaper, less quality gear.  If you are serious
about your craft then you owe it to yourself to try one.

well that would be the best solution to the problem but what i typed was just a ghetto rig way of trying to control it.

trout <trout@pornstarstyle.com> wrote:that wont solve the problem of a dj running a mixer too hot. it clips 
in the dj mixer, and that clipping would be passed thru to the main board.
some mixers handle clipping differently, but most cheaper mixers just 
clip flat,,,,, and thats bad.
pioneers are horrible for this, they have like 1/2 their levels that run 
the red, and djs just figure well, lets hit the top of the meter. which 
is bad. but so many don't know. oh well.
i like don@wws' theory on it, just run compressor/limiter after the dj 
mixer, so no matter how hard they run it, it wont get louder, just 
crappier sounding, and well, thats on the dj, a mixing decision they make.

>true in that sense but then might as well shut off the recording or do the recording from the main board that way you can control the levels to the recording while jacking up the recording for the people that wanted to dance. if you want to run it through the main board you have to hook up recording to an aux send channel then have someone from you crew watch the recording while other people spin then your recording will be fine it won't be perfect and its kind of ghetto but it'll work. just a little advise for everyone out there that wants to record live sets but having problems.

Best Dj? I'd have to say Colin Pierce.
Best Producer? Shawn Rudiman.
Both of those guys really know how to hit it right in the sweet spot!

Thanks Nick.

I just hooked up my subs to my PC.

My godamned nuts slap off the desk everytime somebody on my buddy list signs 
on.

I really don't have any subwoofers.

I am a liar.

Happy Birthday Goose.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixer question - hak and rane

Disclaimer- I'm not an electrical engineer, just a hobbyist. :)

So...

It's all three, really.  The circuit boards themselves do play a role, in 
electronically isolating the different signals so there isn't crosstalk and 
signal bleeding and such.  It's also a good thing to have all the soldered 
joints WELL soldered- if you buy a cheap gemini you run the risk of signal 
degredation or even having parts of the mixer fail completely due to shoddy 
construction.  My first mixer lost one of its turntable preamps within 
months of buying it.  It was a cheap gemini.

Obviously components play a huge role.  There's tons of little amplifiers in 
a mixer, and if you make a mixer that uses cheap amplifiers for everything, 
then the sound quality will be a bit lower.  Just the turntable preamps can 
vary wildly in quality, so be wary.  If you spend hundereds of dollars to 
buy great needles for sound quality purposes, then you hook them into crappy 
preamps, you're practically throwing money away.

Of course, general design is a big factor too.  I have a gemini mixer with 
VCA faders, and they just do not die.  They have been through some heavy 
use, and there's some mechanical problems (i.e. they're loose and the knobs 
fall off too easily) but there has never been a single bit of degredation in 
the sound of the faders.  Mixers that are designed so that the audio signal 
doesn't go directly through the components that get the most wear (the 
faders, the knobs, the switches, etc.) are going to last longer and have 
better sound.

I'm sure there's lots of other issues too.  With mixers that do analog to 
digital conversion, there's lots of quality differences in D/A and A/D 
converters.  If you have effects built into the mixer, there's major quality 
factors involved.. and sometimes high quality components aren't what make an 
effect sound good.

Anyway, hope that gives you some idea...

Subject: {pb-cle} <no subject>

    Geminis are allot of times the "butt of the joke" in the dj gear world.
Up until very recent, every piece they did imitated a more renown brand, and
people who "knew gear" refused to buy anything by them. Now, i've never
bought any geminii major pieces, but I do know personally alot of stuff they
made was crap, not to mention horrible speakers and amps.
    I had a friend who said buy any of the bigger brands, but never buy
Gemini (referring to cd players a few years back). This guy was a mobile dj
who did 2 gigs by himself alone with helper each week (and a huge resume
including a few years on 92.3 from back in the day),said of all his
equipment, his gemini would go bad first.
    Now I dunno about that, but I do know despite all their raggedness,
they've "specialized", if you will, and have put out some more reliable
mixers and cd plater models, but still same ole crap for cheap.
    Now Rane...I hear good things but i'm not to familiar except for with
the older 19" rack mount models (or aren't the new ones like that
too...shit?), but the series before the rotary these days and a regular 4
channel, both were top notch in their leagues performance and reliability
wise...and price was high to if it matters?

I thought doing that was a no brainer so you don't have some dj that
doesn't know (or sometimes does know) what they're doing and blow the
speakers.  Compressors/limiters are required by FCC for radio stations for
the same basic idea, althoug there it's more so it doesn't overmodulate
the signal and stuff.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixer question

I've used several different Behringer mixers over the years and I own one 
right now.  I have been pleased with mine but I should say that its best use 
is as a practice mixer or to be used at house parties.  As soon as you put 
one of those on a good sound system and compare it with a high quality mixer 
the difference is very substantial.  If you are planning on using your mixer 
for recording or performance, then save your pennies and get something with 
better range.  I do love my little 2 channel behringer though, $120 and its 
been to hell and back with me...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixer question - hak and rane

design, components, build quality.
like when a dj moves a volume fader really fast, it'll crackle on a 
cheap mixer, but with better faders thats less likely to happen.  on 
even better mixers they use a VCA in there to totally eliminate crackles.

also the user interface makes a world of difference.
layout, size and feel of the knobs/faders....

Q. CEM/SSM chips. What are they? 
These are custom chips that were produced for commercial 
synthesisers. VCO's, VCF's, VCA's, EG's were all available as 
stand alone chips, requiring only a few extra external components.

They turned out relatively well.

I "under-recorded" as was previously mentioned, and that required a bit more tweaking before they
were ready for distribution.

I screwed up when recording the first 4 sets and was recording at sub-AM Radio quality bitrates
(16khz mono) so sets by me, Lemma, Skillz n Lee, and DEA sound pretty crappy...sort of like
listening to modem-quality Real Audio.

The rest are okee-dokee in that department.

The Tom-n-Goose Experience set is incredible.

The only other big thing I had to do was trim a bit and fix levels on Shawn & Andy's set due to
Moose bringing down the levels on the mixer when his subs blew....I had to trim about 2 mins of dead
air from that set and chop a little 10 second piece so the beats would match and not screw up the
flow of the mix. Hopefully, when listening you won't be able to notice it.

If anyone wants copies of sets, please email me. They're ready to burn.

Black hole hums deepest note ever detected

Wednesday, September 10, 2003 Posted: 1:51 PM EDT (1751 GMT)

WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) -- Big black holes sing bass. One
particularly
monstrous black hole has probably been humming B flat for billions of
years, but at a pitch no human could hear, let alone sing,
astronomers said
this week.

"The intensity of the sound is comparable to human speech," said
Andrew
Fabian of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge, England. But
the pitch
of the sound is about 57 octaves below middle C, roughly the
middle of a
standard piano keyboard.

This is far, far deeper than humans can hear, the researchers
said, and
they believe it is the deepest note ever detected in the universe.

The sound waves are emanating from the Perseus Cluster, a giant
clump of
galaxies some 250 million light-years from Earth. A light-year is
about 6
trillion miles (10 trillion km), the distance light travels in a year.

Fabian and his colleagues used NASA's orbiting Chandra X-Ray
Observatory to
investigate X-rays coming from the cluster's heart.

Researchers presumed that a supermassive black hole, with perhaps 2.5
billion times the mass of our sun, lay there, and the activity
around the
center bolstered this assumption.

Black holes are powerful matter-sucking drains in space, and
astronomers
believe most galaxies, including our own Milky Way, may contain
black holes
at their centers.

Black holes have not been directly observed, because their
gravitational
pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it.

Making waves

So researchers have concentrated on what happens around the edges
of black
holes, just before matter is pulled in.

When scientists trained the Chandra observatory on the center of
Perseus
last year, they saw concentric ripples in the cosmic gas that
fills the
space between the galaxies in the cluster.

"We're dealing with enormous scales here," Fabian said in a telephone
interview. "The size of these ripples is 30,000 light-years."

Fabian said the ripples were caused by the rhythmic squeezing and
heating
of the cosmic gas by the intense gravitational pressure of the
jumble of
galaxies packed together in the cluster.

As the black hole pulls material in, he said, it also creates jets of
material shooting out above and below it, and it is these powerful
jets
that create the pressure that creates the sound waves.

To scientists, he said, pressure ripples equate to sound waves. By
calculating how far apart the ripples were, and how fast sound
might travel
there, the team of researchers determined the musical note of the
sound.

Fabian said the notion of singing black holes might well be
extrapolated to
other galaxies, but not necessarily to the Milky Way.

Chandra has looked at X-ray emissions from the Milky Way's center, and
astronomers believe there is a black hole there, but because it is
a young,
rambunctious galaxy with lots of activity at its heart, this may
interfere
with any note our black hole might sing, Fabian said.

Subject: {pb-cle} wondering about old tune at Nine of Clubs

Dear all,

I am trying to get more info on a song they had played at the Nine in
Cleveland's Warehouse District that went: "this is a journey into sound";
the DJ would often play "Pump Up the Volume" by MARRS beforehand. Anyone
know what song I'm talking about? The year would have to be about 1986-1987.
Who is the artist and what was the
song's title?

Black hole hums deepest note ever detected

Wednesday, September 10, 2003 Posted: 1:51 PM EDT (1751 GMT)

WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) -- Big black holes sing bass. One
particularly
monstrous black hole has probably been humming B flat for billions of
years, but at a pitch no human could hear, let alone sing,
astronomers said
this week.

"The intensity of the sound is comparable to human speech," said
Andrew
Fabian of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge, England. But
the pitch
of the sound is about 57 octaves below middle C, roughly the
middle of a
standard piano keyboard.

This is far, far deeper than humans can hear, the researchers
said, and
they believe it is the deepest note ever detected in the universe.

The sound waves are emanating from the Perseus Cluster, a giant
clump of
galaxies some 250 million light-years from Earth. A light-year is
about 6
trillion miles (10 trillion km), the distance light travels in a year.

Fabian and his colleagues used NASA's orbiting Chandra X-Ray
Observatory to
investigate X-rays coming from the cluster's heart.

Researchers presumed that a supermassive black hole, with perhaps 2.5
billion times the mass of our sun, lay there, and the activity
around the
center bolstered this assumption.

Black holes are powerful matter-sucking drains in space, and
astronomers
believe most galaxies, including our own Milky Way, may contain
black holes
at their centers.

Black holes have not been directly observed, because their
gravitational
pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it.

Making waves

So researchers have concentrated on what happens around the edges
of black
holes, just before matter is pulled in.

When scientists trained the Chandra observatory on the center of
Perseus
last year, they saw concentric ripples in the cosmic gas that
fills the
space between the galaxies in the cluster.

"We're dealing with enormous scales here," Fabian said in a telephone
interview. "The size of these ripples is 30,000 light-years."

Fabian said the ripples were caused by the rhythmic squeezing and
heating
of the cosmic gas by the intense gravitational pressure of the
jumble of
galaxies packed together in the cluster.

As the black hole pulls material in, he said, it also creates jets of
material shooting out above and below it, and it is these powerful
jets
that create the pressure that creates the sound waves.

To scientists, he said, pressure ripples equate to sound waves. By
calculating how far apart the ripples were, and how fast sound
might travel
there, the team of researchers determined the musical note of the
sound.

Fabian said the notion of singing black holes might well be
extrapolated to
other galaxies, but not necessarily to the Milky Way.

Chandra has looked at X-ray emissions from the Milky Way's center, and
astronomers believe there is a black hole there, but because it is
a young,
rambunctious galaxy with lots of activity at its heart, this may
interfere
with any note our black hole might sing, Fabian said.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} wondering about old tune at Nine of Clubs

I'm not sure if the track you are thinking of was was something else on the
more industrial tip, but for what its worth the original intro to pump up
the volume goes "This is a journey into sound... Pump up the Volume, Pump up
the Volume".

The full "This is a journey into sound" sample is also in the intro to Eric
B & Rakim's  "Paid in Full" which (in it's extended form) samples an old
Ofra Haza tune, which probably was a 9 of clubs classic.

Dear all,

I am trying to get more info on a song they had played at the Nine in
Cleveland's Warehouse District that went: "this is a journey into sound";
the DJ would often play "Pump Up the Volume" by MARRS beforehand. Anyone
know what song I'm talking about? The year would have to be about 1986-1987.
Who is the artist and what was the

Black hole hums deepest note ever detected

Wednesday, September 10, 2003 Posted: 1:51 PM EDT (1751 GMT)

WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) -- Big black holes sing bass. One
particularly
monstrous black hole has probably been humming B flat for billions of
years, but at a pitch no human could hear, let alone sing,
astronomers said
this week.

"The intensity of the sound is comparable to human speech," said
Andrew
Fabian of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge, England. But
the pitch
of the sound is about 57 octaves below middle C, roughly the
middle of a
standard piano keyboard.

This is far, far deeper than humans can hear, the researchers
said, and
they believe it is the deepest note ever detected in the universe.

The sound waves are emanating from the Perseus Cluster, a giant
clump of
galaxies some 250 million light-years from Earth. A light-year is
about 6
trillion miles (10 trillion km), the distance light travels in a year.

Fabian and his colleagues used NASA's orbiting Chandra X-Ray
Observatory to
investigate X-rays coming from the cluster's heart.

Researchers presumed that a supermassive black hole, with perhaps 2.5
billion times the mass of our sun, lay there, and the activity
around the
center bolstered this assumption.

Black holes are powerful matter-sucking drains in space, and
astronomers
believe most galaxies, including our own Milky Way, may contain
black holes
at their centers.

Black holes have not been directly observed, because their
gravitational
pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it.

Making waves

So researchers have concentrated on what happens around the edges
of black
holes, just before matter is pulled in.

When scientists trained the Chandra observatory on the center of
Perseus
last year, they saw concentric ripples in the cosmic gas that
fills the
space between the galaxies in the cluster.

"We're dealing with enormous scales here," Fabian said in a telephone
interview. "The size of these ripples is 30,000 light-years."

Fabian said the ripples were caused by the rhythmic squeezing and
heating
of the cosmic gas by the intense gravitational pressure of the
jumble of
galaxies packed together in the cluster.

As the black hole pulls material in, he said, it also creates jets of
material shooting out above and below it, and it is these powerful
jets
that create the pressure that creates the sound waves.

To scientists, he said, pressure ripples equate to sound waves. By
calculating how far apart the ripples were, and how fast sound
might travel
there, the team of researchers determined the musical note of the
sound.

Fabian said the notion of singing black holes might well be
extrapolated to
other galaxies, but not necessarily to the Milky Way.

Chandra has looked at X-ray emissions from the Milky Way's center, and
astronomers believe there is a black hole there, but because it is
a young,
rambunctious galaxy with lots of activity at its heart, this may
interfere
with any note our black hole might sing, Fabian said.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} wondering about old tune at Nine of Clubs

Well, the sample itself is everywhere.  I have like three sample records
that have it.

It's almost as used as "Aaaaahh....  this stuff is reeeeaallllyy fresh."

But due to M.A.R.S. actually sampling Rakim's voice saying "..pump up the
volume...", I'd wager it's the "Paid In Full" remix.

the journey into sound and pump up the volume samples have been
used billions of times. but only one would i call a classic old
tune, the paid in full rmx.

I would think you would have to call the pump up the volume a classic as
well.  It crossed broke through many scenes and genre's and brought people
together.  The alternative clubs all played it, then the big clubs, then the
radio, then the very top 40 places.

MARRS didnt do the paid in full rmx, it was coldcut. to the best
of my knowlege, they did that rmx before "pump up the volume" came
out. im not positive about that though.

i guess ive always considered it derivative of the cold cut rmx so
i dont consider it classic, but now im not sure about which came
first. i cant find anything about it right now, but im on the hunt.

marrs's tune was not related to eric b and rakim. they had one 
12", thats it. coldcut sampled that line from a different rakim 
rap and then stuck it in the rmx to paid in full. then marrs 
ripped off all the same samples coldcut used when making their 
unrelated track "pump up the volume".

marrs's tune was not related to eric b and rakim. they had one 
12", thats it. coldcut sampled that line from a different rakim 
rap and then stuck it in the rmx to paid in full. then marrs 
ripped off all the same samples coldcut used when making their 
unrelated track "pump up the volume".

By my rough calculations, the frequency they were talking about coming out 
of the black hole would have one cycle every 500,000 years.. give or take.

So I don't think you'd notice it.

Low frequencies don't kill you anyway.. high SPL is another matter.

>>trillion miles (10 trillion km), the distance light travels in a year.
>>
>>Fabian and his colleagues used NASA's orbiting Chandra X-Ray
>>Observatory to
>>investigate X-rays coming from the cluster's heart.
>>
>>Researchers presumed that a supermassive black hole, with perhaps 2.5

>>
>>Black holes are powerful matter-sucking drains in space, and

>>at their centers.
>>
>>Black holes have not been directly observed, because their

>>
>>Making waves
>>
>>So researchers have concentrated on what happens around the edges
>>of black
>>holes, just before matter is pulled in.
>>
>>When scientists trained the Chandra observatory on the center of
>>Perseus
>>last year, they saw concentric ripples in the cosmic gas that
>>fills the
>>space between the galaxies in the cluster.
>>
>>"We're dealing with enormous scales here," Fabian said in a telephone
>>interview. "The size of these ripples is 30,000 light-years."
>>
>>Fabian said the ripples were caused by the rhythmic squeezing and
>>heating
>>of the cosmic gas by the intense gravitational pressure of the
>>jumble of
>>galaxies packed together in the cluster.
>>
>>As the black hole pulls material in, he said, it also creates jets of
>>material shooting out above and below it, and it is these powerful
>>jets
>>that create the pressure that creates the sound waves.
>>
>>To scientists, he said, pressure ripples equate to sound waves. By

>>
>>Fabian said the notion of singing black holes might well be

You're preaching to the choir.  I know this.

All I was saying is, because the samples are virtually the same ("I know you
got soul", btw), I'm betting that the song he's referring to is "Paid In
Full".

M.A.R.S. jacked the samples for his own tune, but I never said it was a
remix or anything like that.

Jeez.  ;p

Clean the headshell and tonearm assembly with denatured alcohol, or some
sort of zero residue cleaner (not tuner cleaner it is lubricated).  Then try
again.   Perhaps the cables are bad?

I'm pretty sure the member of "Mars" had more hits than just that (by
themselves or with their other bands).  I can't remember who the members
where, but I do think they were key players.   Oh... did you know pump up
the volume was the first to top the INDIE chart as well as the dance and pop
charts?

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is

Normally associated with his peers in Techno from Detroit, Europe and
elsewhere in the US and the world, John Tejada has embraced electronic
music as a personal frontier, expanding on his formidable resume as a
Techno recording artist as producer and remixer, DJ, and label owner. With
dozens of singles, remixes, some film and TV work and contributions to
sample CDs to his credit, this recent expansion has born a slew of tracks
deeply informed by his uncompromised aesthetic honed over years of
diligent production which finds its roots in Detroit Techno but references
a far broader range of music, both in and outside of electronic music. His
musically formative years were steeped in Classical music, growing up in
family of performing artists--his mother a soprano singer and his father a
conductor which then widened to include hip hop, DJing and finally,
electronic music.

Known for crafting a brand of subtle, musical techno, his recorded output
ranges across tempo and genre lines, from chilled out affairs with
spacious arrangements to pulsating, densely layered, deeply energetic
tracks that work magnificently in the hands of DJs as well as on the home
stereo.  Earlier on, his music found release on labels such as A13,
Multiplex and Generation R&S. Following on to those successes, he
established his own imprint, Palette, in Los Angeles, in 1996, and has
enjoyed seven years of steady growth and recognition. The label has served
as an exclusive outlet for his own prodigious output but has recently
begun to expand its roster.  He has also continued to record for other
labels such as Plug Research, Seventh City, Moods and Grooves, deFocus,
Sino and others, often in collaboration with 12 year long collaborator
Arian Leviste, and alongside these numerous singles, has also produced
eight albums; two for A13, Palette and one each for deFocus, Plug
Research, Moods and Grooves and Playhouse.  John's Cleveland shows are
always amazing events and we expect nothing less from him this time.

Warm Art is a global experiment dedicated to entertaining and educating
world dancefloors with the intelligent sides of techno, house, electro,
and experimental beats.  The Warm Art collective contains djs and
producers located throughout the world, including Atlanta, Chicago,
Cleveland, Los Angeles, Seattle, London, Norway, and Dubai.  Abbasso
Underground Lounge in Cleveland hosts Warm Art on the second saturday of
each month.

EARTHDANCE/ SIDETRAKKT 4-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

Saturday, September 20, 2003
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
 
flyer is online at: http://www.sidetrakkt.com/webearthdancefront.jpg 
(front)
                and:  http://www.sidetrakkt.com/webearthdanceback.jpg 
(back)

a sonic psychedelic journey guided by:

JIRAH (performing LIVE)
(Thump Radio/U.S.T.A Records - Israel - Seattle)

Jirah's debut album, Outer Access, has just been released on Israel's 
U.S.T.A Records to much critical acclaim. As well as being a resident with 
Thump Radio, Tim has performed in various cities across the U.S., Canada, 
and in Israel. He has earned a reputation for being a seamless dj and 
moving live act, transcending the boundaries of time and space and 
reaching out to touch the soul. His work is best described as energetic 
and uplifting psychedelic trance with touches of the past right along into 
the future. Tim has a true love and passion for his music which shows in 
every set he plays. We are honored to welcome Jirah as he makes his first 
east coast U.S. appearance.

www.jirah.com
www.ustarecords.com
www.thump-radio.com

ONNOMON (performing LIVE)
(Soular Records - Philadelphia)

Onnomon's music has been described as a cinemagraphic journey for the 
heart, mind, and soul. With releases on Soular Records, they are gathering 
momentum in the North American festival circuit. Their music will bathe 
you in a lush, powerful rush of steaming beats. A booty boutique of 
musical tomfoolery and sardonic sensibilities.

JIRAH
(Thump Radio/U.S.T.A Records - Israel - Seattle)

Psyphon (sidetrakt - Pittsburgh)

This event will celebrate both sidetrakkt's four-year anniversary, as well 
as Earthdance , the global dance party for peace, which will this year 
take place simultaneously in over 120 cities in more than 50 countries.

100% of all proceeds will be donated to the Thomas Merton Center, with a

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

THE ENTERTAINMENT DOME:

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please dont be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he is mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} wondering about old tune at Nine of Clubs

>From allmusic.com:

M/A/R/R/S' lone single "Pump Up the Volume" remains a watershed in the history of sampling,
heralding its gradual absorption from hip hop into dance music and ultimately the pop mainstream.
The 1987 record was the brainchild of 4AD chief Ivo Watts-Russell, who assembled M/A/R/R/S' line-up
from the ranks of label acts Colourbox and AR Kane; the concept behind the single was to fuse the
rhythms and beats from classic soul recordings with state-of-the-art electronics and production,
complete with scratches by champion mixer Chris "C.J." Mackintosh and London DJ Dave Dorrell.
Originally mailed in an anonymous white label to a group of 500 influential DJs, "Pump Up the
Volume" derived its title from the Eric B. & Rakim rap snippet that was the disc's most obvious
sample; it appeared commercially six weeks later, debuting in the Top 40 of the UK charts and
eventually reaching Number One, where for untold listeners it served as an introduction to the
nascent underground dance scene. "Pump Up the Volume" was also a hit overseas, but plans for a
follow-up never materialized as M/A/R/R/S quickly disintegrated in the wake of financial squabbling,
becoming a one-hit wonder of rare influence.

marrs's tune was not related to eric b and rakim. they had one
12", thats it. coldcut sampled that line from a different rakim
rap and then stuck it in the rmx to paid in full. then marrs
ripped off all the same samples coldcut used when making their
unrelated track "pump up the volume".

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FWD: BASS


with such a ridiculous, mind-bogglingly low frequency, you could live and die (of 'natural causes')
quite a few times before the wave would cycle once. it's pretty much undetectable by anything but
the fancy-schmanciest of equipment....

besides that...i think the fact that it's coming from a BLACK HOLE presents more of a problem,
living-wise, than the frequency of the wave itself. it's not exactly a vacation spot....

Momentum?
A Live Show,  A Concept,  A vibe,  A forum for community cross-pollination.  
A dozen musicians, artists, DJs, and performers from diverse disciplines 
gather.  Many have never shared the stage before.  Some will be meeting for 
the first time ever. Other stage guests may arrive unexpectedly.  We place 
them all on stage as an ensemble with a full concert sound system - and we 
ask them to perform a completely unrehearsed show!!!  The audience provides 
the inspiration.  A special vibe nucleates between all witnesses to the 
night.  And the energy begins irradiating - transferring from one element to 
the next to the next to the next to the next to the.....

Celebration?
We're celebrating not just our own collective's one year anniversary, but 
also the many positive things that have taken shape in the local scene and 
community at large.  Our collective's goal has been to expose the immense 
potential of large cross-pollinating network of creative people that exists 
in our urban core. It's a community that includes artists, small businesses, 
cultural venues, public forums, creative spaces, community groups, 
grassroots organizations, young professionals, high-tech junkies, and 
countless individuals with unbound  energy and an eye to the 21st century. 
Join us in celebration of the new vibe that's enveloping our city.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable problems

I have had the same problem with my set up recently.  I have the same 
cartridges you have, or rather the same style, banana.  I wasn't getting any 
sound out of the right channel of one of the turntables.  I checked my set 
up and made sure everything was connected and all the cables were proper and 
all.  Everything was set up correctly, so after scratching my head, I 
decided to switch cartridges and now they both work fine.  I have switched 
back to find out maybe its something with the tonearm itself, but since the 
problem is fixed I thought I never had to...  As well I think I am going to 
change to mounted cartridges or at least get new styli once I make an excuse 
for why I have to spend MORE money this week. ai yi yi yi yi yi yi...

>> banana

>> it works fine on the other table

my experience from recording on tables using these needles is that they 
regularly have noticeable differences between the channel levels. 
honestly, i hate these ortofons with a passion because of all the problems 
i've had to deal with them over the years.  i don't spin, so i don't know 
the attraction djs have for them.  the only cause of this that i am able to 
conclude is that the design of the cartridge itself tends to make the 
contacts pull away from the ones in the tonearm, even so slightly, which 
doesn't exist in the headshell.  cleaning the contacts with an eraser and 
re-seating the cartridge has often worked in the short-term, but i've not 
yet found a permanent solution to this issue with these ortofons.

i've never had a problem in the world recording from 1200s using cartridges 
mouted in the headshell.  never.

Momentum?
A Live Show,  A Concept,  A vibe,  A forum for community cross-pollination.  
A dozen musicians, artists, DJs, and performers from diverse disciplines 
gather.  Many have never shared the stage before.  Some will be meeting for 
the first time ever. Other stage guests may arrive unexpectedly.  We place 
them all on stage as an ensemble with a full concert sound system - and we 
ask them to perform a completely unrehearsed show!!!  The audience provides 
the inspiration.  A special vibe nucleates between all witnesses to the 
night.  And the energy begins irradiating - transferring from one element to 
the next to the next to the next to the next to the.....

Celebration?
We're celebrating not just our own collective's one year anniversary, but 
also the many positive things that have taken shape in the local scene and 
community at large.  Our collective's goal has been to expose the immense 
potential of large cross-pollinating network of creative people that exists 
in our urban core. It's a community that includes artists, small businesses, 
cultural venues, public forums, creative spaces, community groups, 
grassroots organizations, young professionals, high-tech junkies, and 
countless individuals with unbound  energy and an eye to the 21st century. 
Join us in celebration of the new vibe that's enveloping our city.

all three of my turntables were bought new and i've used only sliver or
black concond carts.  i've never had an ounce of trouble with them.
however, when i play on other tables using concords i've noticed
problems with the connections.  after i pop the carts off i almost
always see nasty/rusty connections.  i must assume it's from people
licking the contacts and re-seating the carts.  licking's bad m'kay?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable problems

ortofons have this nasty tendency to mess up the contacts in the tonearms.
sometimes a cleaning will fix it.
sometimes chaging to a headshell with better contacts will help.  i 
stand by the old school stantons, but the new ones are good too, a 
little more durable, but not as stylish   :)

you definately have the right idea switching to mounted carts.

well i suppose it's because they look cooler and theres no messing 
around with mounting it, versus mounting a cartridge in a headshell.  
let alone mounting it properly!!

i'm not really sure, i think its the _flat_ contacts of the ortofon 
pressed against the _flat_ contacts of the tonearm.  so they'll end up 
getting some tiny bit of crud and they dont sit well.
most headshells i've seen have a rounded set of contacts.  this i 
believe gives a better contact and will push small bits of crud outta 
the way.

ditto.  other than a bad cart.  i've seen where the coil on one side got 
damaged.  but thats not the contacts.

yuck.

yeah, the spit is not good, i dunno why people do it.  monkey see, 
monkey do.  i just rub the contacts on my jeans to get any crud (read: 
spit) off the contacts.  sometimes it helps. others it doesn't.  i guess 
it depends how much crud is on the contacts in the tonearm.

BTW, back to the original question, i use either very strong alcohol 
(190-195 proof) or sometimes isopropyl alcohol, but make sure theres not 
alot of water or other stuff in that.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable problems

i knew there was a reason i used shure m44s besides how loud they are and
how much bass they put out....

although 2 of my best friends use ortofons....one has concordes that he
bought in early 2000...6 styli later the things are still kicking....and the
other uses the niteclubs that he bought in early 2001...they are doing fine
too

if im not mistaken, the bananna ortofons are thier low end carts...they
might not be built up to the par of the concordes and niteclubs

do yourself a favor and get a set of shures though(m44s or
whitelables)...you will have no problems

djs have the nasty habit of messing up the contacts in tone arms by licking
the headshell and putting it back on the tone arm.  This helps oxidize the
tone arm metals much faster then normal.

I think its funny that all these djs lick the headshell and put it on to
"help" with the contact when they are actually creating the exact reason as
to why they need to lick it in the first place.

ortofon are nice because any stylis will fit on any cartridge.  This is
great for scalability.  When I purchased final scratch I also purchased
nightclub E stylis for recording and some dj S for playing the fs records.
I have the om version on the nightclub cartridge, they fit in the normal
headshell.

Yeah shures are great for playing out because they tend not to skip.  but
at the same better tracking means they are eating up your vinyl (obviously
depending on how you have the tonearm calibrated).

I am always happy if at a gig the turntable is outfitted with shures as
opposed to ortofons or gemini or some crap that will skip super easy if
someone is close to the decks.

I stick with ortofon nightclub ellipticals for home use because they sound
incredible for both listening and recording purposes.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable problems

if im not mistaken ortofon also makes a headshell mount cart.

i think ill stick with my shures tho, ive had them for about 2 years now and
they still sound great...if i do buy new carts, ill probably get the
whitelabels...i had a chance to try them not long ago and they are as good
as advertised

i set the weight way low....shure says the cart needs about 3 grams...i do
about 1-1.5 at home but i have my tables sitting on big blocks of foam and a
super sturdy table...playing out is a different story...ill usually set the
weight around 2 and move it up to around 2.5 once i get a feel for how
skippy the tables may or may not be

Every time I've played on white labels (always in club
situations) I've found them to be pains in the ass
with regards to skipping...perhaps its been the way
they're been weighted, but i 've had them weighted as
high as 2.5 grams (from my understanding a lot for
them) and they still try to skip given the slightest
provocation.  As far as sound they are at least as
good as concorde's, but as far as ease of use they are
a PITA from my perspective.

Is there a wrong way to mount an Ortofon catridge into a Technics headshell?

It looks self explanatory; I plan on doing it someitme in the near future. 
If there is anything I should know beforehand.... well, HOLLA AT ME

I hate it when people say holla'.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

You know, I considered saying that the recordings were from the 1905-1910 
time period, just to be more clear.. but I figured everybody would know what 
I meant.

I suppose I was wrong. :)

Nough said. And I thought I was the only one useing stantons....
 
I had 2 sets of ortofons that shit the bed. One set channel issues. It seemed I couldnt do anything with them. Just didnt want to work..
 
The other pair broke within 7 months. Some how one of the grooves broke on the needle when i tried screwing them back onto the tonearm. (Another friend of mine had this happen too)
 
Bought the stanton needles and havent had a problem with them since. Beautiful!

stand by the old school stantons, but the new ones are good too, a 
little more durable, but not as stylish :)

I think Doug told me once, the best way to clean those damn things, but i dont remember what he said...  :(   
 
Licking makes the rust i believe.

yuck.

yeah, the spit is not good, i dunno why people do it. monkey see, 
monkey do. i just rub the contacts on my jeans to get any crud (read: 
spit) off the contacts. sometimes it helps. others it doesn't. i guess 
it depends how much crud is on the contacts in the tonearm.

BTW, back to the original question, i use either very strong alcohol 
(190-195 proof) or sometimes isopropyl alcohol, but make sure theres not 
alot of water or other stuff in that.

Ive used shure's as well. Those are the needles that I use most to be honest. I feel the sound quality seems better to my ears....  i have  set sitting in the house thats used more often than the stantons.

although 2 of my best friends use ortofons....one has concordes that he

other uses the niteclubs that he bought in early 2001...they are doing fine
too

if im not mistaken, the bananna ortofons are thier low end carts...they

yes, get an ortofon concorde OM and mount it in a proper headshell.  
these are NOT regular concordes, they have to have a headshell.

the regular concorde and the trackmaster, and the like, don't need 
headshells, they are integrated cartridges.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable problems

Those stantons are the ones I use.  Albeit I haven't been practicing that
much lately, but they've worked great.  One has the white front part of
the headshell (or is that the cartridge, been a while since talking about
this) and the other is blue and still don't notice any audible difference
between the two.  I'll probably still get a set sometime down the road and
keep those at home and put the ones I have now in some case so if I'm out
somewhere and they need needles, if I lose those I'm not out a ton of
money, although I would still be pissed.

well no, because they are probably designed to dig into the vinyl deeper,
so you can scratch with them.  If you want to get some crazy
cartridges/styluses for audiophile purposes go with some moving coil
deals.  But until then stick with elliptical ones for the best sound
reproduction (versus spherical).

If elliptical reproduces better sound, what advantage do the spherical 
styli's have?  Better tracking?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable problems

i thought it went:

spherical reads the side of the groove, generally better stereo 
separation, and cleaner grooves (meaning the crud gets pushed to the 
bottom of the groove).  and that spherical has greater surface contact 
with the groove meaning less friction, so longer record life.

elliptical reads the bottom of the groove, gets a better grip, but can 
read some of that crud at the bottom.

i think stanton or vestax or one of the needle manufacturers had a page 
explaining that somewhere.

also i believe a record hammered to death by an elliptical needle can be 
played on a spherical needle and some of the fidelity will be reappear 
since its playing a different part of the groove.

m44's also eat away your vinyl faster.  ortofons are overpriced imho.. best
bang for your buck and durability are what i prefer, the good old stanton

Ortofon sells 10 Spherical to every one Elliptical.  Elliptical reproduces
better sound, but wears the record more.    I recomment Elliptical for
recording, Spherical for performance and everything else.

Subject: {pb-cle} New York clubs?


Anyone have any suggestions on any cool places to check out on a weekend
in Manhattan?  I'm going on holliday with my friend from Ireland.  Its
her first time to America and I want to show her some of the scene or at
least club life - I'd love to check out some dnb there.  I guess I
should post to some other lists but just thought I'd check here cause I
know there some people that vist there on here.  I guess we have an
apartment on the upper east side that were staying at so anything sounds
good.

I'm so gonna have so much fun, Manahatten 19-21st, Cleveland for a
couple days, US Grand Prix 27-28th, Mamoth Cave 29th, Graceland 30-1st.
Last stop is her call, but at least I get to say I've been there.
Natural Redheads with Irish accents rock my world!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} New York clubs?


Go to any record store and pick up a "flyer" it is a small mag that will
have all the event listings and things like that to check out.   Breakbeat
science on orchard st will not only have the flyer, but since they are a
DNB shop, they would also be more than happy to point you towards DNB
events.  www.breakbeatscience.com for number and address.

I suggest hanging out in washington square park and the village. make sure
to eat some true NY pizza, theres many great places to go but the best I
recommend for a "tourist" is in Penn station, since the slices are always
from fresh pies, due to the amount of traffic coming through there.
Rosa's is my personaly favorite there.  To me the pizza is more important
than the club biz..

NY DNB scene really isn't too great at this point.  The best nights are
weeklies.  Direct drive might still be going on though, it used to be a
good time.  like I said check the flyer magazine, talk to the guys @
Breakbeat Science.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable problems

>From my understanding, elliptical needles have more surface contact AND less 
record wear.  Unfortunately, they don't give you any advantage if you're 
playing records that are dusty or have been played a lot with sperical 
styli.  Sperical might be better at skip resistance and back cueing, I seem 
to remember reading some reasons why on the Shure web site.  A problem with 
sperical needles is they wear down the sides of the record groove, 
eventually molding it to a sperical shape.  Meanwhile, the needle itself 
gets worn on the sides, giving it a more elliptical shape.. meaning if you 
play your records a lot and don't change your needles, your records will 
just keep getting worn deeper and deeper.

I also read that you should never rock back and forth on the first beat of 
your record before you mix it in.. that's something that just about every DJ 
I've ever seen does- and it wears out that first beat and heats up the 
needle for the rest of the record...  The needle gets to something like 300 
degrees when it's playing, so if you're rocking back and forth in the same 
place you can pretty easily wear that spot out.

Scratch DJ's just have to grin and bear it, periodically replacing their 
scratching records and needles and such...

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} turntable problems

Turntable Lab sells a thingy for cleaning contacts called the DeoxIT
Pen.  I've never tried this stuff before, but I trust Turntable Lab.

If the link doesn't work, look for DeoxIT Pen

Things package for the Complete Fan--plus much much

Definitly check out the Village. You gotta eat a fallafel while you're there.. THere are a lot of little walk in middle eastern restaurants that have them to go.. Mmm fallafels..
 
YOu can check out a bunch of different people spinning at most lounges on any given night. Pick up  a Flyer mag or a Time Out New York 0 it has club listings with DJ's spinning. It also hass addresses of any museums, galleries (and descriptions of current exhibits) tourist attractions and cool shops.. It can be found at any newsstand..

Go to any record store and pick up a "flyer" it is a small mag that will
have all the event listings and things like that to check out. Breakbeat
science on orchard st will not only have the flyer, but since they are a
DNB shop, they would also be more than happy to point you towards DNB
events. www.breakbeatscience.com for number and address.

I suggest hanging out in washington square park and the village. make sure
to eat some true NY pizza, theres many great places to go but the best I
recommend for a "tourist" is in Penn station, since the slices are always
from fresh pies, due to the amount of traffic coming through there.
Rosa's is my personaly favorite there. To me the pizza is more important
than the club biz..

NY DNB scene really isn't too great at this point. The best nights are
weeklies. Direct drive might still be going on though, it used to be a
good time. like I said check the flyer magazine, talk to the guys @
Breakbeat Science.

I've just woken up to hear of this... I absolutley
knew FOR SURE that Mr. Cash would be leaving us before
winter. As I said recently, this guy was such an icon
and a legend... he had an amazing life, may he RIP. 

John Ritter played one of the best sitcom characters
ever, but he was good in everything I ever saw him
in... esp. 'Slingblade'. It's totally tragic and again
reminds you that you can go anytime, anywhere. Life is
so sad and unpredictable, I don't know how most people
deal with it but I myself struggle with these concepts
just about every day.

OK I'm really depressed now.

Yeah I heard that on the way to work.  I had it on 1100 AM just to get the
weather when I heard that.  It was cool that they played his rendition of
Hurt, REALLY depressing now, though, but still cool that they played it. 
And then someone at work was listening to 105.7 (oldies, for you pghers)
and they played the same song.  I wonder how many times that's going to be
played today.  And me and TRAAAAT were just talking about him the other
day, too

Maybe this is too soon to get into this, but since RIAA is still a big
topic... What happens to all the money that the RIAA is going to be
getting for having Hurt played a bunch of times today?  Can no longer go
to him, obviously, not sure what all relatives he has has left, so does
that mean RIAA is now getting 100% of the money now, as opposed to
probably 99% before?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 'Man in Black' Johnny Cash dead at 71

Well, I know that he has at least one daughter.  I'm sure she gets a healthy
cut of his royalties now.
I love his version of "Hurt," but I think his versions of "In My Life" and
"We'll Meet Again" are even better.
What a guy.  He'll be missed.

Yeah and if you die and have no kin, royalties go to your estate. the
companies don't get to keep them just cuz you died.  And I think
organizations like ASCAP and BMI make sure that you get your cut in that
sense.

Ecstasy Brain Damage Research Fatally Flawed

The credibility of America's leading ecstasy expert Professor George =
Ricuarte was virtually destroyed this week, when he admitted testing the =
wrong drug in his recent study linking ecstasy (MDMA) with brain damage.

The government-sponsored researcher injected monkeys with =
methamphetamine instead of MDMA during his experiments and conceded his =
findings were 'completely false'. His mistake (labelled 'a terrible, =
humiliating blunder' by The Observer) was caused by a 'labelling error', =
he claimed.

"We're scientists, not chemists, we get hundreds of chemicals here- it's =
not customary to check them," Ricuarte explained.

Ironically, Ricuarte's research drew immediate flak from other =
scientists as soon he published his report last November with one =
leading neuropsychiatrist Charles Grob calling it "the latest in a =
string of biased studies sponsored by the (US) federal government" =
(Washington Post).

Rucuarte's report was also challenged in Germany this May, when =
scientists published the conclusions of their own study, involving a =
massive selection of long term ecstasy users.

"These results were particularly interesting in that they dramatically =
contradict an American study done by George Ricuarte (funded by the US =
government)", said an editorial in the prestigious Journal of Nuclear =
Medicine.

"This huge discrepancy is both unexplained and troubling, as Ricuarte's =
claims were used both to justify outlawing ecstasy in the US and as =
justification for sentencing increases".

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3089350.stm ('Killer' Ecstasy claim =
was false- Research suggesting just one Ecstasy tablet could harm humans =
was based on a laboratory mistake, it has been revealed . . .')

Er, well, "In My Life" is a Beatles song and "We'll Meet Again" is a
standard (although allmusic.com lists it as being composed by
Charles/Parker).  I believe "Hurt" was his only NIN remake.

Woops guess I should've been clearer on that.  I heard at work someone
mention that he did a whole album of NIN stuff, although I thought it was
just a whole bunch of remakes of songs from different artists.  should've
known that since she didnt' look like the NIN type :)

MR. MARC GUEI
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB),
FOREIGN OPERATION DEPARTMENT.                                 
PORTO-NOVO REPUBLIC OF BENIN. 
E-mail: marcguei4@usa.com

Dear Friend,


                                                                   
                      (CONFIDENTIAL) 

I am MR. MARC GUEI, the director in charge of auditing and 
accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK PORTO-NOVO REPUBLIC 
OF BENIN in West Africa with due respect and regard. I have 
decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be ver

y beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. 

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department 
came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased 
person who died on October 31st 1999 in a plane crash and the fund 
has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any c
laim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation 
before our discovery to this development. 

Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself 
to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful 
during the time of execution. The said amount was U.S $5.7m (Five 
Million Seven hundred Thousand United States dollars). As 

it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information 
through the chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here 
in Porto-novo Republic of Benin. 

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as 
the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required 
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put 
in place and directives and needed information will be relaye

d to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to 
assist me and also benefit your self to this great business 
opportunity. 

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my 
position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not 
allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an 
eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work



in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a 
second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a 
foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferr

ed into on his request as it may be after due verification and 
clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the 
whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank 
account. 

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk 
free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be 
entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will 
be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the 

time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for 
me. Please, you have been adviced to keep "top secret" as I am 
still in service and intend to retire from service after I 
conclude this deal with you. 

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until 
you confirm the money in your account. and ask me to come down to 
your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to 
percentages previously indicated and further investment, eithe

r in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All 
other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear 
from you. 

I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish 
in this deal. You can contact me on my private email address: 
marcguei4@usa.com


I look forward to your urgent reply. 

Yours faithfully, 

MR. MARC GUEI.

approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put 
in place and directives and needed information will be relaye

d to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to 
assist me and also benefit your self to this great business 
opportunity. 

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my 
position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not 
allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an 
eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work



in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a 
second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a 
foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferr

ed into on his request as it may be after due verification and 
clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the 
whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank 
account. 

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk 
free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be 
entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will 
be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the 

time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for 
me. Please, you have been adviced to keep "top secret" as I am 
still in service and intend to retire from service after I 
conclude this deal with you. 

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until 
you confirm the money in your account. and ask me to come down to 
your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to 
percentages previously indicated and further investment, eithe

r in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All 
other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear 
from you. 

I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish 
in this deal. You can contact me on my private email address: 
marcguei4@usa.com


I look forward to your urgent reply. 

Yours faithfully, 

MR. MARC GUEI.

And now that you just sent it to everyone on here, who are undoubtedly at
work.  I'm at an ISP too but it doesn't bother me one bit, the web
interface I'm using has an SSL connection, so no packet sniffing me.  Plus
I figured out a way to setup a secure tunnel to my network at home so I
can go to any website securely if I want, well it's secure from here (ISP)
to my home computer at least.  Maybe if I get bored I'll set up the proxy
at home that I use to go through a secure anonymous proxy or something :)

Thanks 2 all for the "Paid in Full" reference ("This is a journey into
sound"). Many nights were indeed journeys into sound, from Nitzer Ebb to
Ministry to Depeche  Mode to Art of Noise to Bauhaus to the Smiths to MARRS
to the Cure and I can go on and on. In my estimation, the Lift and the
Aquilon hold never a candle to the Nine. Special mention to slam dancing
during the "Mountain Song."

Haven't been to London yet, but Dublin's not tooooo bad as far as the dance
scene is concerned. County Kerry in the west of Ireland, my home base -
including towns Killarney and Tralee - needs some decent turntablists badly.

Sincerely,

I disagree here.when set up correctly; the m44's are one of the BEST with
vinyl wear.

 

Now, the problem MOSTLY lies in the fact that so many DJs flip the
counter-weight around and try to get as much downforce onto the needle as
possible. If this is the case, of course the m44s will wear out records.

 

Unfortunately, what these DJs don't know is that the m44s track BETTER and
sound BETTER with the correct counter-weight (and tonearm height) settings.

 

This is not directed at you, Goose, just making a point. :-)

Sounds like the musical lineup at 1470's here in Dayton, if you add in some
Front 242, And 1, NIN, and KMFDM.

Well, I know what I'm doing tomorrow night, you's got me in the mood.

who can use "proper" weight on a needle with MASSIVE monitors on either 
side of the decks?
or on wobbly ghetto folding tables?
or tables on "bouncy" floors?
you gotta either crank it down in those cases, or have skips.

Yup..  It's often best just not to take chances on things skipping and 
put more than the proper weight, just like you said.  Records skipping 
during a set is a bitch, in the middle of a mix its a disaster.

why should monitors be massive? they should only be able to reach 
a reasonable volume, and they should be behind the stacks. i hate 
loud monitors, and i really hate when they cant just be turned 
down from the deejay mixer. i like my hearing. 

anyway, i also hate the reversed tonearm weights. i also like my 
records, i want them to be playable for a long time. at my house i 
have the weights on the right way and set to about 1-1.5. shit is 
pretty solid like that. 

people need to quit acting like theyre fucking q-bert when theyre 
queueing their records. unless youre doing some heavy duty 
scratching (which is almost no one anymore) theres no reason to 
have the weight set up any other way.

intelligence, and of the best senses, the listening senses and of
imagination and intuition. And as soon as it becomes just a means for

well stockhausen obviously just doesnt understand whats up. i know
hes coming from a different approach, but the idea that he
dismisses "african" music as useless and says that the only good
music is intellectualized crapola just sounds like typical
germanic racist bullshit. that whole idea is the white guy's
disease: its what makes them kill black music forms. theyre like
"this is too primal. i dont wanna dance. i wanna sit there like a
twat and try to look smart." ARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH.

    Right, so they use jazz and swing cuz its "kewl" music and despite it
being very dancable (African American decent)... Well and it gets screwy
from this point on... (and I don?t need another RnR lesson (Lord knows 5
months was enough)), but eventually down the line our good friend Rock and
Roll comes about, popularized in the past 35years by a 90% white compromise
of musicians and market. Dancing in our culture plain out phizzez away
untill disco (which was never big btw here, it was still RnR dominated).
    But don't dis the german/europeans, because these days theyre the ones
with major dance cultures revolving around EDM, at least in the youth. Again
this goes back to disco and how it was bigger in Europe than it ever peaked
here, and what eventually turned into.
    So what does anyone have to say about the hipness of Rap (before Eminem,
too) about it being accepted by so many white suburbans? Let's start
popularizing jungle, if its the "im bad ass" vibe that they get off on and
feel by listening to someone talk about complete utter urban nonsense with a
rhyme scheme.

HUH?   Many (if not most) of the disco artists were amercian AND I don't
know how old you are but I remember coming home from school watching "How to
disco dance" tv shows in the afternoon.   I guess disco wasn't big enough
for 2 radio dj's to proclaim "Disco is dead" in the middle of a White Sox
(Cubs?) game and start a riot of people bringing disco lp's in to burn
(hence my ongoing point over emenim declaring 'nobody listens to techno')
AND starting an nationwide "DISCO SUCKS" campaign.  I guess disco wasn't big
enough to influence KISS into making a disco track either.  Even Cleveland
was on top of it -- we had a nationwide syndicated tv show filmed at one of
the clubs up here.  Rumors or trax I think -- the one with the revolving
dancefloor that raised up to allow 'fog' - dry ice at the time - to
dispurse.  Even Mr. Mel Cheren - owner of West End Records who were tied to
the first 12" and owner of paradise GARAGE - had ties to Cleveland and comes
back to visit his friend Buzz at twist periodically............. and for
that matter GARAGE and HOUSE were terms that were american bred as well as a
response to the anti-disco movement.   The loft parties were american as
well.  Get your facts straight pal.  :-)

Now granted, there was probably a whole UK scene as well - but I would bet
it was probably bigger here.  Come on, Disney doesn't market "DISCO DUCK" to
a small little trend.   I don't have evidence to back it up, but I be
willing to bet that whole UK disco scene happened AFTER it did in the us.
Many foreign people still refer to it ALL as disco.

Early on in my discovery of electronic music, though, I remember hearing of
fairly known local techno dj's (92-94ish) who said that techno was white
bred and that they did not like any other forms of electronic music because
it came from "niggers and fags".  They would go around saying that that was
the mentaility of all techno djs who play real detroit stuff... when in
reality it was just their method of social campaigning (so very cleveland if
you ask me).  In retrospect, even though most of you are not aware this went
on, I think this is one of the wedges that was was driven in our local scene
early on.

Because that is what is force fed to them.   The ghetto lifestyle is the
only "alternative" to whitebred america that MTV shows.  So you fit into one
of the 2 or 3 models of society they serve.  I grew up in a small rural town
that had MTV and the kids were all ghetto acting and into hip hop -- But my
early club gig was in a town 3-4 times larger that did NOT have MTV and
people were very different.  People came to the club and I was many times
their source of new music.  It was awesome.... because I would test them
constantly.  I would throw them things I liked and watched them enjoy it....
then I would throw them things I knew that radio would make popular for them
and watch them clear the dancefloor.

I feel that all this is going to mutate in the next year or so.  What once
was will be no longer... and what's next will have all different terms and
expresions.  You can't improve a "tainted" term like techno, but you can
certainly slap a new name on it and repackage it -- which is what I think
will happen.

One other thing that shows disco's popularity....

I'm pretty sure Z108 which was THE END and POWER 108 was known as DISCO
108 -- and most of my friends who were djing in the disco days used to go in
and do mix shows, etc.  The big joke was Kenny King's and disco -- cause
they alwas seemed to order that.  Also, they used to prop a broom or
something up against the wall to slow the turntables down so they could
match beats.

So maybe I was a little fast to speak...Respect, I havent lived to see any
of this for myself. All I know is what I read and hear, but I do have the
ability to make my own assumptions on what I learn.

I agree, bands like ABBA would have never came about if they hadnt heard
american stuff and done their own thing. But this just followed suit with
that whole stereotype that everything american is "cool", or at least untill
major more developed countries began creating their own pop culture trends.

My point is that while disco straight up died here, it resonated in europe
for a bit afterwatds, morphing into 80s stuff that both american and
international disco acts decided to pursue. That whole time, Americans were
living 80's rock rebirth phase that screamed FUCK DISCO, this is our
thing...breeding a society of brainless grunge haired followers and their
rockSTAR artists. Yes, the lines do become blurry when you consider bands
like the Scorpions and (damn im havn a brainfart, that brit Punk band), but
for the most part, dancing still lived in the european Discoteques.

So Detroit is responsbile for the most part of the birth of Techno. NY and
Chicago of House. Miami for Freestyle. But did these honestly become more
than small niches/fads in our society? It ussually never made anything more
than the clubbing charts in this country, which is irrelevant to a GOOD
portion of people who read billboard(proof that we are a RnR and sing-a-long
pop songs society). Now the rest of the world really began eating house and
techno stuff up, and I don't think it ever really went away after the
Brittish summer of love in 1988. That, I think, was the definitive point in
dance culture as European raves blew up and denounced rock. Did the 20k
person parties in the late 80's/early 90's that they had in the middle of
fields make anyone think that disco didn't have a bigger affect there?? Was
any of this going on in America? No, it was a smaller underground gathering
of heads who appreciated the music and werent ashamed to party and dance.

MTV and the major american record companies can suck on my testicles, on one
each respectively.

I hope your right. I've been telling myself theres gonna be a change when I
heard alice dj,eiffel 65, Darude on the radio, but even that "techno" stuff
went away. I thought trance was our only way of infultraiting the
mainstream, but ive lost hope.

Techno specifically (EDM in general) isn't tainted, its tarnished, as is
anything that sounds electronic and with no words. Repackage it? I'm not
gonna even take a stab at this, but the second I hear of something that I
believe in and that I think will grab more than my attention, it will have
my fullest support.

Agreed.  But dancing still went on here, it just went underground.  Just as
disco had its mainstream side, it also had its underground side.  Disco only
died in pop culture... in the underground it went on to become GARAGE then
HOUSE.  If you ask me it's all just disco.

Wanna explain this one to me....  KRAFTWERK.  It holds it's place for some
as the giving birth to techno.  However, how can that be?  One of their
biggest hits was the soundtrack to the urban breakdance culture?  I have
never fully understood that.... and I'm not talking about how any of you
growing up in the mid-90's switched from urban culture to "techno".... but
how did this happen in the beginning?

I'm guessing there were two lines here.... disco was fairly organic compared
to today's music.  Many live bands and instrumentation was used.  Kraftwerk
was the first all computer music, right?  So when disco followed its natural
evolution it became more computer/sequenced orientated.  But as for
lifestyles and rave culture I just don't get it.  In my mind it's all just
disco so I never understood how our scene gives so much credit to Kraftwerk
other than maybe coming up with some new beats.   Perhaps that came in a
time where kids who were raised on "anti disco" ideals looked to Kraftwerk
as an alternative somehow.

That's another thing... post disco in the US came funk.  So much of the funk
at that time, though, was danceable.  SUPERFREAK and all that stuff was a
short branch of disco.  Even old george clinton and parliament tracks got
played by "disco" djs after the meltdown.  At least that was in the
mainstream... then underground was still going on.

I don't know... if you just look at it all as dance music there has been a
constant.   Even as late as the early 90's there was dance music on the
radio --- but not now.   You all make a big deal out of "Dirty Vegas" making
it to radio but there was tons of dance music on the radio in the early
90's... even stuff on small independent lables like strictly rhythm.  Dirty
Vegas only made it to radio after CAPITOL/EMI picked it up.  The EURO
(trance pop hi energy rubbish) that makes it to radio doesn't count --- it
never has --- barbie girl, haddaway, culture beat, etc === dj sammy, atb,
etc.  None of it holds relevance as being good music, just pop dribble.  I
think "rave" aka "techno" helped give all dance music a bad name --- 
expecially when euro/pop became the norm.  But your right... people like to
sing a long.  That's no different anywhere except Americans don't take their
clubbing seriously enough to understand or identify with the music.  I can
sit and sing along with all my house favorites... and feel the emotion and
understand the story... but no one else knows em because that stuff isn't
getting played as it should.   I can sit here and recite a favorite lyric
"Can you imagine a place where all that matters is the music?  The Dj plays
and the party people loose it?   Singing, spinning, dancing around... I like
the soulful sound of the underground.  No pressure, no fear, Nobody's in
your business 'cuz nobody really cares.  Everyone is special and you should
feel the same.  I'm so glad you came!"  or "We are the kids of the quiet
revolution.  We feel house music, we dance house music, we live HOUSE music"
and get a chill up my spine and a tear in my time every time I hear it --- 
but it holds no relevance for anyone else because they are not exposed to
the music in the first place.

It has now.   Rock is outselling techno in Europe now.  Stephanie

Your right.  Certainly dance music had a bigger effect in Europe.  Probably
because of the overal general openmindeness and many other cultural
differences.  Expecially the way music is presented to people.... in America
he with the most money wins.  In the UK, well, you listened to what you were
served and had to find other things.

This mentality bothers me.  Dance music has ALWAYS been on the radio in one
form or another until recently.   Eiffel 65 and Alice Dj,  that's EURO &
ITALIAN pop.... For the FINAL time.

Darude (sandstorm) is to now, what 2 unlimited (get ready for this) was to
then = JOCK JAMS
DJ Sammy (heaven) is to now, what Nikki French (total eclipse of the heart)
was to then = GAY BAR MUSIC THAT CROSSES OVER
Effiel 65 (blue)is to now, what Haddaway (What is love) was to then. = EURO
CHEESE
Alice dj is to now, what Culture beat was to then.

however

then you had stuff like ROZALLA, PLANET SOUL, JENNY, CLUBLAND, EVERYTHING
BUT THE GIRL, CRYSTAL WATERS and other great normal dance music that crossed
into the underground and on the radio.

Trance wasn't our way of infiltrating the mainstream... as that stuff isn't
trance... it was the stuff that killed "techno" because it's EURO ITALIAN
CHEESE POP that mutated into and got renamed "trance" because "HI ENERGY"
was too gay of a term... forcing real trance djs to repackage the evolution
of their sound as "prog".

electro clash? that's what they were trying to force but I don't see it --- 
althought it's influence is everywhere now.  personally i think in order to
progress there needs to be a bit of a unification... more anthems that
everyone can identify with.  I guess we'll see this is a big learning
experience.  This reminds me of 94, though.  Hip hop's gonna get boring and
mainstream will look for something else.

Honestly, ALL of those artists, both the cheese and non, are what led me to
experiment and get into the REAL dance music. I have in many terms lost
respect for my mid 90s eurodance and even trance from then to late 90s, but
I will never lose sight of the fact that they are what brought me where I
am, bsing on this post today. It's NOWHERE else to be heard, and where else
could have a 10 year old got a tast of the underground if no other medium
was presented to him? It was MY gateway, and im sure for many, many others,
as well. I'm sure if I had played my old self jungle several years ago, I
would have been like...wha? But people are constantly changing, and if
something new that?s closesly related to something old is presented to them,
they will learn to like it or hate it, or go somewhere in between.

Listen, I don?t WANT to be mainstream, honestly. But if we let this sink
into the sand, whats gonna be around for me to listen or do tomorrow? Can
you expect someone to like hard banging fucking drum techno if theyre into
Dave Mathews or Will Smith, or whatever, by simply playing it to them? And
Im NOT talking about taking them to a rave with thousands of watts of sound,
intense visuals and lights, and giving them a little pill that begins with
the 5th letter of the alphabet...Sorry, I came in the other way...And we
sometimes wonder why the only people left these days are the ones who havent
moved on to other stuff or along with a small percentage who stumbled on the
way to school and found a nice shiny flyer...

Well, I try not to be jaded some days...Big upz, Doug, you are one of the
few resources for what we love these days...

Alex

There can be no "underground" without a mainstream.

There never has been one, and there never will be one.

I support the mainstream more these days; it's simply more exciting.

man...alot of talk from a buncha white dudes.

all i can say is that i dont like white people because they are
always stealin' somebody's stuff.

unfortunately, this kind of theft makes them millions, garners
influence, and changes history. too bad there is no prison
sentence for it. (and this is just for MUSIC!!)

1. Kraftwerk were inspired by james brown. they wanted to emulate
his genuine funkiness for the german crowds.


2. electroclash. 1 whiteguys mission to start out a music genre by
ending it from the beginning. yes. lets popularize a musical style
into a fashion from the beginning! (oh yeah and totally dropping
the original name of the genre took it away from what it was...
electroFUNK!)

3. trance: white guys stealing the original funk blueprint from
detroit and fucking it all up.

tom, stay away from my house. i know you want to steal my
stuff....and i will not trade  you any of my records for those
bead trinkets you keep offering.

Stealing? I think it's either improvisation, continuation, picking up
wherever someone left off, etc, but stealing shouldn?t describe this. I
don?t want to make this into a racial issue, but dance music isnt based on
ones color of skin. A label will not (or at least should not) pick up or not
pick up someone up because of the color of their skin. If he's got the funk,
he's got it. Period.

Besides, Jeff Mills describes it perfectly right here from that Techno
Tourist post that I think tom had given us the link to a few months back
(BTW, I printed this very interview out and have 3 away messages consisting
of snipetts from it- KOALA TEA):

Techno music in the black community is not existent. It doesn?t exist in the
black music in America. So there is not much I can say about the inclusion
of techno. If we were recognized the people may actually be kinda proud of
what the guys from Detroit have accomplished. At this point it doesn?t
exist, it?s zero.

 http://technotourist.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&re
q=viewarticle&artid=19

If you really are proud of the detroit mob for starting this thang, don't
blame others who popularized the music and call them a cracker for doing so.
Be proud that it was sooo good that people acctually liked it enough to try
and emulate their sounds. I don?t criticize eminem or the beastie boys for
being white rappers, its not a BLACK thing. I only criticize them for their
"topic of discussion".

The reason I preach about that stuff is that there HAS to be another side to
the mainstream.  While I hated sade growing up... I love her stuff now?
While I hated deeper house growing up, I love that stuff now.  My taste for
eurcheese lasted all of 2 years and it was only to further what I was doing.
HOWEVER... in this day and age of 1 hour sets, too many people get by
passing that off as their "sound" and that's why I get passionate about it.
Hard House = perfect example... a couple tracks peaking out a set is ok a
full set is bad.

I'm not trying to be jaded either... I'm just saying there is not other side
to balance all of this out.  The people who play the cheese stuff we are
talking about who don't also play top40 act like their sound is the end all
be all and have NO INTENTION of using it to further or push music along.
That's why I get bent out of shape about it.

I say people have left because they haven't been presented alternatives to
music.  Too many clubs and promoters promoted to rave101, and did nothing to
entertain the silent masses WITHOUT ADD.  Or in the instance of clubs, well
that's another story.  Most watered themselves down to cater to the
dwindling crowd those forsaking their base.  I can explain that better but
its not relevant right now.

Oh well...  we gotta keep pushing on :)

peace,

doug

Agreed.  I kind of was leading to that.  We need some more anthems in dance
music that cross over.  It's not possible for the Euro stuff to cross into
the underground thought.  Needs to be more on the housey side of things.

Don't Call Me Baby got played by a lot of underground house djs before it
got big AND it had a bit of a different beat for the time.

I dont see why it matters if blacks listen to any genre of electronic music
or not
I think of it as a whole honestly. One big family world wide....

I love how Bailey quotes
"I'm really looking forward to having a chance to be at the forefront of
underground drum & bass on what is going to be the UK's premier black music
station"

well thats not exactly true. house and garage were essentially
disco at first. and the stuff that the euros were into that
influenced techno alot was italo disco, essentially white guys
trying to make disco records with electronic equipment. and doing
it decently well, might i add. moroder is the man for sure, as is
kano.

the sounds and ideas for modern pop music have been stolen pretty
much wholly from dance and hiphop. so while the people might not
get the props they deserve for starting things, the effect theyve
had is well noticeable.

but that aint the truth of the matter. and thats really what jeff
mills was talking about in that interview. its not that the music
wasnt accepted in the black community when it began, its that
mainstream marketing has beaten it down and taken white guys and
marketed them to suburban white kids (hawtin, oakenfold, sasha,
dickweed).

the beastie boys, IMO, werent necessarily purposely pillaging and
whitening hiphop. eminem on the other hand i absolutely believe
wouldnt be where he is today if he wasnt white. and i feel like i
do have to blame anyone who has stolen and whitened music to make
money while the real people get nothing.

i love it, finally a black guy who steals white guys' tunes and
makes big hits from it but he gets shit talked on him but elvis

its the imperialist tendencies that white nations seem to have.
its so strange, but they love taking other peoples' shit and then
taking credit for it. to be sure, europe has gotten much better
about it, especially compared to america.

how bout this: jeff mills needs to start making songs
about slappin ho's and running shit, and how much more
dope he is than the other techno producers, and then
the mainstream black community would be all about it.
simple.

that's it for me.

traat:  can we add discussion of race as off topic similar to 
talking about whether drugs are good or bad?  all you're gonna get 
is a bunch of people who know reality and those who act as if 
reality isnt really the truth.  they parallel each other imho.

jes: you're white, you've never had to deal with discrimination, 
and in the circle of friends I keep (and i'm guessing your 
situation is similar) there is not discrimination nearly to the 
extent that happens daily in other settings other than a 
respectful dance community that is accepting moreso of differences

tom:  you're white.  you can't run for president of the NAACP as 
much as that may be a dream job of yours, but i agree strongly 
with whoever you ripped that quote off of and didn't cite.

i play what i like, and i don't worry about who doesnt
like it. also i rock crowds. to me that says enough. 

also it's not racist it's true. it's cultural, not
color. everybody who knows me knows i'm about the
furthest thing from a racist. anyone who doesnt doenst
concern me.

	in on them=pixxx

Yah....

So I stayed in today and rented some movies. Maybe this has surfaced before
here, and I might have brushed it off or what not, but I JUST saw "Bowling
for Columbine". For anyone who hasn't seen it and thinks they know what it's
about, I say that you don't what's up, and you need to give this movie 2
hours of your time...especially if the Terminator himself can capture your
attention for 30 minutes less than that.

A very good documentary, this guy plain out gives Americans a voice. I do
feel encouraged to be more active when it comes to issues presented here.
Also a very sad movie, so do watch it with a clear head...  Refrain from the
12 pack untill after movie, like me (im sure id be bawling (more?) if I was
on some sorta hallucinagenic).

Time to watch "house of a thousand corpses". *click* --*[pops open cold
one]*

Good night,
Alex

im gonna have to call that one out,
your comments were offensive. no amount of claiming you arent a
racist, and no amount of proving it by you having black friends
does NOT take away from the offinsiveness of your comments.
secondly the denial of the fact that you may have done something
offensive only adds fuel to the fire.

break a spine,

There's been a fair amount of agitation about that movie, since apparently 
Mr. Moore wasn't particularly concerned with fact checking.  It's a very 
biased piece of work, and several times statistics are skewed in ways that 
may or may not represent reality...

That may be. I will do myself the good favor of enlightening myself with the
true facts before I make any sporadic decisions, but I did find the movie to
hit certain personal chords. This coming from the radical liberal that I
am...

you know what?? not just whatever, what i said is a

afraid to speak my mind. and also what i'm saying is
exactly what mills is saying, that black people
predominantly don't listen to techno. the fact that he
seems to think that this is due to some white
conspiracy i just don't buy. i think it's beacause
intellectual music will never be popular in any
mainstream, any color or culture. what about miles
davis or charlie parker? how do their record sales
compare to those of j-lo? you tell me. real art will
always be ignored in favor of marketable garbage, and
you and i both know this.

the last thing i am is a racist. i don't care who
wants to say i am for that very reason. i kmow where i
stand, and if you don't, and won't take the time to
try and understand it, that's your choice. i can't do
anything about that.

Hey all,

Spam is spam and if you often click to remove yourself from one spam email
list (unsubscribe) you are automatically joined to five others. It's like a
medusa where you cut off one tentacle, and more tentacles replace the one.

Whatever you do, don't respond to spam.

You can also download spy-ware, which removes "cookies" from your computer;
spam-blocking software is another helpful hint from Heloise.

This is why people are they way they are today. Can never look 
beyond people's minds. Always having to slap a cover on the book.

Guy's, I think this is the most stupid debate I've seen in a long 
time. When I say I think of this scene as a "whole", I really 
meant it. I don't know why people have to categorize others, and 
if you or someone else is going to keep doing so, then so will the 
others that learn from your stupidity. When I was brought into 
this scene, everyone was treated with respect no matter who you 
were. Now and days its gotten to be rotten because it seems 
absolutly no one is working together anymore. It's a shame.

I like how I was told I've never been discriminated. Was that 
because I'm white?! I've dated two black men in my life time, who 
still to this day have treated me with the most respect than 
anyone else I've ever dated or come across. It's the 
ignorant "public" (and I'm saying everyone in general) that 
slapped the racial comments on our relationship, but it was us 
that looked beyond that. Trust me, I've dealt with it but is it 
what makes the world go round?

I've never once in my life made a racial comment to anyone, and 
never will. That's me. If you want to slap the cover on me or 
anyone else saying that it's "denial", then that's the most 
stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. I just dont understand 
why people cant treat each other with equal respect. Maybe you're 
in denial.


I'm done with this topic.

yeah, honestly im pretty taken aback by this whole thing, i just
didnt think colin had it in him. its funny though, i think some
white people think that because theyre not a member of the KKK
that theyre not racist. that shit kills me.

dude. you are breaking my brain. when you say "culture" that means
(from m-w.com):

5 a : the integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and
behavior that depends upon man's capacity for learning and
transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations b : the customary
beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious,
or social group c : the set of shared attitudes, values, goals,
and practices that characterizes a company or corporation

so you cant say that and then argue that it has anything to do
with mass marketing (which is what the real issue here certainly
is). and whats especially funny is that the massive record sales
of "gangster music" (obviously youve not listened to much
ludacris, buddy) are due to white people buying into the racist
marketing behind the music. but theyre not racist, no. 

>are you going to
>say this isn't true? i'm saying MAINSTREAM. mainstream
>white kids listen to kidrock and limp bizket. same

mainstream white kids listen to jay-z and dr dre. this has nothing
to do with mainstream vs underground or black vs white. what you
said was plain old ignorant. and your defenses of it are just
making me more and more irritated about it. 

>you can drop the big scary easy R-word as much
>as you want, i'm not scared of it because it's simply
>not true.

here's the "im not in the KKK" argument. look, you might not
maliciously hate people of other races. but the comments you made
are straight up ignorant and IMO definitely not cool. 

>you don't have to agree with me, if you

plenty of other "non-racists" arent afraid to speak their minds:
trent lott, strom thurmond, etc.

whoa. what is "intellectual" about dance music? last time i
checked, music doesnt posess intelligence. its the bullshit put on
that music (by mostly white people) that makes it intellectual.
dont you find it at all odd that mainstream record companies
wouldnt do shit for the black guys making music in detroit and
chicago until their music got popular in europe and white people
started making it? then they took that shit and are selling it
back because it fits into their marketing idea for white people.
but the black guys making the shit still dont get that kind of
treatment because they dont fit into what the record companies
think should be marketed to black people. 

>what about miles
>davis or charlie parker? how do their record sales

jazz music was black music and was widely marketed as such before
white people took it and mostly ruined it. techno and house were
much smaller and less marketed before they were stolen.

i think you need to reevaluate your definition of racist, man.
like i said i think its entirely possible you arent being
malicious, but just ignorant. and ignorance is just as racist and
maliciousness.

its not denial. all i said was that your comment came from a
position of white privilege and thus isnt in line with what is
really going on.

ok colin, you arent a racist. you are ignorant. simple as that.
what do you think early 80's rnb were? what do you think the whole
electro movement or underground disco movements were? who
supported them? hiphop, rnb even some soul and disco all are
related to techno...and directly responsible for techno's
creation! had it not been for the support of these genres, the
boom chaga boom chaga boom chaga ADATT crate of records you own
would have probably never existed. As for techno today, I'll admit
that there is little or NO support of it by the black
community(though there IS a "movement" in detroit right now
changing that, i like to take part of this "movement" at least
once a year, and have for 4 years and counting.). i beleive it has
something to do with the majority of electronic music being
"faceless" and america in general needs an image to associate with
music. the only faces you see in electronica..most of us are
embarrased to discuss... Moby(to many, the face of electronica)
for instance...not to mention most beleive techno is ADATT music
written by some black turtlenecker from germany..such is the curse
of electronics in america...of course, those MOMENTUM gigs that go
on around town definately prove otherwise...(the people, from all
walks o' life were really into the soulful techno sounds.) one can
argue:jazz = techno.

yes, ALL people were supporting these things, however, in music
history one cannot deny that the music created by a peoples during
times of struggle were ALWAYS taken away, and reinterpreted in
such a way that the original intent of the music was lost.(trance
comes to mind here) whats mainstream today in HipHop is
stereotype. whats popular in todays rnb is also stereotype...which
is easy for the WHITE community to eat up and take in. i have to
wonder why an artist like KRS-1 NEVER got as big in the white
community as...Jay Z(the side kick to The JAZ, artist on "Hawaiian
Sophie"). hmm.. one must wonder this.  MTV will find some other
genre or people to exploit next year. can't wait to see rich
suburbanite teens shuckin and jivin on tv...but this year it seems
its gaysploitation, and latinsploitation...(fuck you wayne brady,
you fucking sambo!!)

is this progress? i dont know(somehow i doubt it). i can say that
im(not so)ho i dont like some of the exploitation that has
occured. i used to love hip hop. i used to love rnb. i used to
love listening to WAMO.  

sure, influences are good. such as the James Brown influence on
Kraftwerk. but then you have out and out exploitation... (the
today show showing whats in in HiP Hop fashion, and CNN reporting
what the Hot Hip Hop LP is...)i guess it really wont bother ya
until its something that DIRECTLY exploits you, or that which you
love.


enough with my ranting & rambling.. and sorry if i seem a bit
harsh..but this is one thing that really gets under my skin..

break a spine,and dont steal my stuff,

How doesn't it? I took on every bit of bitterness that came along 
with it. Just because Im no black doesnt mean I cant feel for my 
partner who is. Get real Tom, your white. It's not like you can 
debate about being black.

Doesnt matter. I treat everyone with respect, there for Im one

I'll be playing this afternoon @ Twist from 3-9pm.  Deep and vocally.  It

This shits getting to far... And honestly, I'm confused? Would someone like
to point out the racism in Colin's mail? Maybe it's encoded in some pattern
that isn't visible to the white eye?

I wouldn't have said it myself, but the truth is that Jeff Mills is not a
mainstream black artist. I don't think that by Colin saying he would be if
he added some charactersitics to his music that DOES in fact describe what
mainstream black music consists of, is a racist comment in the sense that
everyone should run and hide like Colin is going to come lynch anyone? Maybe
it was a little poor taste, but if the man denies the ACCUSATIONS that he's
racist, I really don't think you should be cocky about it and rub it in his
face, that?s disrespectful.

So you people think what you want, but when the shit words start flying you
need to cool it. Theres no elitists here, and if there are, you might have
subscribed to the wrong local rave post. And go ahead, if someone wants to
call me a racist, too, cause I said something that "leads you on" to me
being racist, I say I'm NOT. If you don't believe me, tuff shits. Go cry
yourself to sleep.

Go back to the disco part of this thread or cap this shit now. Uncool.

The music is faceless because of a over emphasis on the dj.  A simple yet
effective way to create hordes of consumers.  We have all been through this
before.  Capitalism rules in usa bla bla bla.  Down with the war machine bla
bla bla.

On the tom calling everybody racist note - just ban his email.  I did about
9 months ago and haven't looked back.  I'm sure some counter productive
negative statement will come from his mind about this ;p

been workin in the studio for the past 5 hours, time for some wolf.

empathy isnt the same as knowing what its like. when you went out

you could switch it off.

youre right i cant. but i can say that my experience is that race 
does matter and im not going to let the fact that ive been dealt 
one of the easiest hands stop me from pointing out the bullshit.

and hey, if you never murder anyone thats not going to stop all 
the murder in the world. so if thats as far as youre willing to go 
to combat racism, thats lazy to me. not judging people is simply 
the norm. not joining the kkk doesnt get you a medal.

actually, youve hit the nail on the head. what he did was make a 
popular generalization about "black culture" that happens to not 
only be incorrect but extremely offensive. but because its okay 
for pop media to bemoan "gangster" music, this doesnt register as 
racism to you. but it is.

anyone? 

youre missing the entire point here man. look at what markets 
the "gangster" music: white people. look at who buys it: white 
people. to claim that this denotes some sort of predisposition of 
black people to like "violent" music is absolutely racist and 
offensive. look at violent movies. theyre mostly made by white 
people starring white people. why does the music affect black 
people but the movies dont affect white people the same way? to 
even begin to say that sounds to me like youre saying that black 
people are just too stupid to discern reality from fiction. and 
really when you examine violence in black communities you can see 
that it existed when motown was popular. and if you look at poor 
white communities you can see the same kinds of violence. so the 
real issue is the economic disparity in this country that allows a 
greater percentage of black people to be poor compared to the 
percentage of white people. and you can look at the mainstream 
media's coverage of crime in black neighborhoods vs in white 
neighborhoods. and everywhere you turn the manipulations are being 
made by white people. so what is plain for you to see is just the 
end result of a basically racist society. free your mind. 

>Maybe
>it was a little poor taste, but if the man denies the ACCUSATIONS 
that he's

if someone is racist im going to call them on it. sure theres a 
difference between buring crosses and just being an ignorant ass 
cracker. but theyre both part of the same problem which is a 
racist societgy created by white people.

your points (before this email where you defended the "facts" that 
colin brought up) have been mostly based on what you read in the 
jeff mills interview, and if anyone is qualified to discuss this 
issue it is jeff. but what he said is not the same thing as what 
colin said.

Not judging people is impossible and you know it.

It is human nature to judge whether you like it or not... if you deny it you 
are a liar.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

thats a white person's defense. white privilege means not getting
pulled over by asshole cops just cause youre black. white
privilege means not being followed around by store employees just
cause youre black. white privilege means having access to better
funded schooling.

good argument, though it is semantics. i was speaking about being
judged on skin color alone. there are plenty of judgements that
are valid though few if any that are less valid than skin color.

>can this thread stop all ready. Im tired of your racist comments.

nope. my comments are strictly realist. white society is
responsible for using ideas and language to fuck with minorities.
and while you may try to argue that you do your part, i dont think
so. as part of white society to be doing something you need to be
actively speaking against bullshit racism. and if you are
disagreeing with my arguments here, youre basically doing nothing.
i do my part by pointing out and exposing as much racism that
white people take for granted as i can.

Hey guys, it's me, Stevie t!

I am surprised by how few friends I have on Friendster, considering the fact 
that have solved over 70 world solutions and started the Ohio rave scene 
after graduating from an Ivy League University.

So add me as your friendster already!

My email address is steviet069@hotmail.com

I don't even smoke cigarettes.

stevie t

P.S. Quit spying on my penis!!! That means YOU, Jes!

Except for the fact that Bowling for Columbine *ISN'T* quite a
documentary.

Several parts of the movie are ficticious, and I can guarantee you that at
least one of the 'interviews' in the movie was edited, heavily, to make
the interviewee look bad.

Watch it; learn.  But remember that it has HEAVY spin on it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} by the way

I'm staying on this list.  Anyone can make any comments towards 
me.  My skin is thicker than a message on an email list can 
penetrate.  The badge I wear is one of white skin, for I did not 
choose to be born this way, it was predetermined.  That is what 
makes it not possible for me to 'experience' in our american 
society the hardship/discrimination a person with differently 
pigmented skin experiences.  The label of racist falls upon 
every 'white' person due to the stereotype that our forefathers 
have let us inherit and others around us perpetuate.  As tom said, 
unless you are actively speaking out to others around you, until 
there are no stereotypes being created out of 
miseducation/misunderstanding, until intolerance is not something 
that is in practice, there will never be a time when racism is not 
an issue on every level (majority vs minority, minority vs 
majority, minority vs minority).   The differences shared among my 
group of friends and acquaintances (mainly culturally and 
socioeconomically) are also what drives our understanding of one 
another.  That is where things are not a matter of race, religion, 
creed, sexual orientation, etc... BUT instead it is the external 
influences we have that are of consequence.  From those that do 
not understand, that need to be educated.  It is something that we 
all need to examine, and not be all panties in a bunch if someone 
calls you a racist.  Maybe you are not a racist, but something you 
believe or interpret parallels a racist belief, such that by 
dating someone of another ethnicity it somehow has now given you 
a 'get out of stereotype' free card.  That's narrow minded 
thinking.  

I'm done for now, it's midnight and all and left my Mandrake 
configuration downstairs for the past half hour just to check 
mail, not expecting to write this....

actually i think the funniest thing after my most recent visit
from vegas is the huge stack of call girl business cards i
had been handed.

these women are obviously professionals, their business
cards are full color, even my sister who works at microsoft
and makes over $80K/year paled in comparison to the
business cards of call girls i was handed in Vegas.

i was handed almost 30 of these cards there, instead of 
baseball cards, i have a collection of call girl cards!

btw, the real peeps can discern from you poser republitards
because like you guys say, you're a bunch of ditto-heads
that repeat the same damn things because you have no
creativity whatsoever: kill the democRATS, kill the geeks,
he makes us into PORNGEEKS, etc. etc.

OVERLOADED HARDCORE AREA:

| MARC SMITH (Notorious Vinyl/Bonkerz : Glasgow, Scotland) *FIRST USA 
APPEARANCE!*
Marc is truly a legend within the UK hardcore scene. Hailing from Scotland, 
where if it's not hard they don't wanna hear it, he is always one of the 
hardest. Playing all throughout Great Britain and most of Europe, he is 
widely known to drop some of the hardest hitting material around. With such 
anthems as "Boom Pow", "Encounters", and "Identify The Beat", along with 
countless others on labels such as Clubscene, Bonkerz, Mainframe and his own 
Notorious Vinyl, Marc has continued to push a sound he has both originated 
and pioneered. Please join us as we are proud to present Marc Smith for his 
first USA appearance!

| STARGAZER (Phase 4/Raw Elements/Elation : London, UK) *FIRST USA 
APPEARANCE!*
In the last two years, Stargazer has proven to be one of the busiest 
hardcore producers in the UK.With several releases under his belt on his own 
label Phase 4, along with appearances on Elation, Raw Elements, Raver Baby, 
and too many engineering credits to mention, the secret is definately out 
that he is the fastest rising producer in the UK Hardcore scene. One of the 
few remaining secrets about Stargazer's incredible talent is his DJing, as 
he rarely plays in the UK due to his busy engineering schedule. This is a 
very rare DJ appearance and FIRST USA APPEARANCE for this amazingly talented 
producer!

| OMAR SANTANA (H2OH Recordings/Moonshine/Topaz : Los Angeles)
This man really needs no introduction. Widely recognized throughout the 
world as one of the USA's top Hardcore DJ's and Producers, Omar Santana is a 
full force to be reckoned with. When he's not touring such far off places as 
Holland, Italy, Spain, Belgium, or one of his many stops here in America, he 
is in the studio writing material for his top Hardcore label - H20H 
Recordings. We are proud to welcome Omar Santanafor a very rare Northern 
California appearance.. so get ready to rock.. and ROCK HARD!

| CLOUDSKIPPER vs. DJ SPREE (Raw Elements/Liquidvinyldjs.com : SF vs. 
Sonicfury.net/Spreeandadb.com : Minneapolis - CLOUDSKIPPER CD RELEASE!)
Quite possibly the most popular and talented Happy Hardcore DJs in the USA.. 
there is little doubt that comes to mind when you ask the fans of these two, 
which stretch all across the world! Cloudskipper and Spree were the 
beginning of Hardcore to many people, especially here in the USA, and over 
time their sound and style have developed into both of them being the most 
respected Happy Hardcore DJs in America. They will be coming out to perform 
together for the first time in 2 years here on the West Coast.. this is the 
one set for all the Harder and the Happier not to miss!

September 12, 2003 
Ramsey Clark Responds To Bush's TV Address  
By Ramsey Clark Former U.S. Attorney General 9-10-3 
Dear VoteToImpeach Member: 

Sunday night, September 7, President Bush told the American public and the 
world to expect more of the same from his administration. More crimes against 
peace and humanity, more deaths and destruction, more debts and poverty. He 
wants everyone to help. 

President Bush has spent $79 billion attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and seeks 
$87 billion more for another year of violence. What he calls "one of the 
swiftest and most humane military campaigns in history" has taken more than 30,000 
Iraqi lives, destroyed "tens of billions" in facilities essential to life, 
electricity, water supply, sewage disposal, according to Paul Bremer, and left 
the whole country destitute, in turmoil, growing violence and rage. Thousands 
perished in Afghanistan where the destruction remains unrepaired, the people 
disoriented and impoverished, the highway from Kabul to Kandahar is impassable 
and violence is mounting. 

U.S. casualties in Iraq alone have reached 300 dead, 1200 with disabling 
injuries, and a total of 6000 returned to the United States in body bags, on 
stretchers, or sick in body or mind. U.S. soldiers are being killed at a growing 
rate, now 1 or 2 a day. 

In the meantime, 2 1/2 million jobs have been lost in the U.S., 1.3 million 
families slid below the impossibly low poverty line of $17000 a year for a 
family of four. U.S. government deficits have erased a surplus of $590 billion and 
created a debt of $400 billion, a trillion dollar loss, with deficits of $400 
billion plus expected for the next several years at least. 

Not content with his crimes against peace, wars of aggression, crimes against 
humanity, assassination, summary execution, torture and illegal and secret 
detentions, President Bush boasted "...and we have captured or killed hundreds 
of Saddam loyalists and terrorists... seizing many caches of enemy weapons and 
massive amounts of ammunition. We have carried the fight to the enemy... the 
surest way to avoid attacks on our own people is to engage the enemy where he 
lives and plans." 

That means more wars of aggression. More summary execution and 
assassinations. More arbitrary arrests, more illegal detentions and disappearances. 
Guantanamo is a symbol to the world of President Bush's contempt for human rights: 
torture, suicides, secret detention, military trials, an execution chamber 
waiting. Guantanamo should be returned to Cuba now -- a century late. 

U.S. forces must be withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan. These must be our 
last foreign military interventions. U.S. companies must be barred from 
profiting from contracts for "rebuilding Iraq" which the U.S. destroyed. Ten percent 
of the U.S. military budget at the 2003 level should be paid into a U.N. fund 
for the next decade to compensate Iraq and Afghanistan for U.S. crimes against 
them, to be used as they choose. 

We are virtually guaranteed more of the same unless President Bush is 
impeached for his high Crimes and Misdemeanors. 

To take back the Constitution and save our country Vote to Impeach now. This 
vote is an unmistakable message from the American people. The world and the 
present Administration will understand this message. It means we do not accept 
the crimes President Bush has committed in our name and will not permit their 
repetition. 

Sincerely, 

Ramsey Clark

how hypocritical that the US falsely accused Iraq of acquiring 
Uranium from Africa and used 1,100 to 2,200 tons of Depleted 
Uranium in their tank piercing shells in attacking Iraq causing 
the radiation levels to be 1,000 to 1,900 higher than normal...

from 
http://earthchangestv.com/secure/2003_articles/0903_articles/0903_1articles/02radiation.htm...

September 2, 2003 
Dangerously High Levels of Radiation Measured around Baghdad 
Express [London]

SOLDIERS and civilians in Iraq face a health timebomb after dangerously high 
levels of radiation were measured around Baghdad.

Levels between 1,000 and 1,900 times higher than normal were recorded at four 
sites around the Iraqi capital where depleted uranium (DU) munitions have 
been used across wide areas.

Experts estimate that Britain and the US used 1,100 to 2,200 tons of 
armour-piercing shells made of DU during attacks on Iraqi forces.

That figure eclipses the 375tons used in the 1991 Gulf War. Unlike that 
largely desert-based conflict, most of the rounds fired in March and April were in 
heavily residential areas.

DU rounds are highly combustible and tiny particles of the radioactive 
material are left on the battleground.

If inhaled the material can attack the body causing cancers, chronic illness, 
long-term disabilities and genetic birth defects - none of which will be 
apparent for at least five years.

Veterans of the first Gulf War believe that DU exposure has played a role in 
leaving more than 5,000 of them chronically ill and almost 600 dead.

The Royal Society, Britain's leading scientific body, described America's 
failure to confirm how much or where they used DU rounds as an "appalling 
situation".

Professor Brian Spratt, chairman of the society's working group on DU, said: 
"The Americans are really giving us no information at all and think it is a 
pretty appalling situation that they are not taking this seriously at all.

"We really need someone like the UN Environment Programme or the World Health 
Organisation to get into Iraq and start testing civilians and soldiers for 
uranium exposure."

Evidence of massive uranium radiation has emerged in recent weeks. The Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle analysed swabs from bullet holes 
in Iraqi tanks and confirmed elevated radiation levels.

Last month Scott Peterson, of the respected Christian Science Monitor, took 
Geiger counter readings at several sites in Baghdad. Near the Republican 
Palace, his radiation readings were the "hottest" in Iraq at nearly 1,900 times 
background radiation levels.

Even the Ministry of Defence, which has consistently refused to accept there 
are dangers involved in DU exposure or that it has played role in Gulf War 
illnesses is addressing the problem. Soldiers returning from this year's conflict 
will be routinely tested for uranium poisoning. Professor Malcolm Hooper, who 
sits on two committees advising the Government on Gulf health issues, said he 
is not surprised by the radiation levels.

He said: "Really these things are dirty bombs. Exactly the sort of device 
that President Bush and Prime Minister Blair keep talking about being in the 
hands of terrorists."

Dozens of US soldiers, backed by armoured vehicles and helicopter gunships, 
searched farms on the outskirts of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul yesterday 
in their hunt for followers of Saddam Hussein.

THOUSANDS of Iraqis packed into northern Baghdad yesterday for the funeral of 
Ayatollah Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim, a Shi'ite Muslim cleric slain by a car 
bomb which also killed scores of his followers.

A senior official in Hakim's Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in 
Iraq (SCIRI) said the Americans bore some blame for Friday's attack as they had 
failed to ensure adequate security measures.

Up to five suspects, all of them Iraqi, have been detained over the car bomb 
attack, the local governor said yesterday.

Holyneo316:    did you see on the news, that blaster internet virus had even 
effected some nuclear plants ?!
Holyneo316:    on some news they mistakenly called it 'slammer' 
Holyneo316:    i just finished de-bugging my system 
DJTHRILLA2:    yeah  
DJTHRILLA2:    same here  
DJTHRILLA2:    antivirus I think has already ran for me  
Holyneo316:    even my sister from microsoft wasn't sure about the bad 
program i found...i basically had to:
use safe mode, pinpoint it, by-pass it, de-install and re-install some 
programs 
DJTHRILLA2:    also already ran spybot and ad-aware  
Holyneo316:    well i have an anti-spy, a fire-wall, and an anti-trojan, and 
that damn virus still got through... i know that damn virus has done millions 
of dollars damage to all these business that use microsoft 
DJTHRILLA2:    yeah  
DJTHRILLA2:    what else is new  
Holyneo316:    but the thing is if the computers connected to the nuke plant 
malfunctioned, we could've had meltdown! 
DJTHRILLA2:    yeah true  
DJTHRILLA2:    easy thing to fix though  
DJTHRILLA2:    I already am in the process of making a proposal to several 
important agencies now to stop this shit once and for all  
Holyneo316:    actually according to the news report off of AP, they were 
notified 9 months ago, but just made the updates on aug. 20 
DJTHRILLA2:    yeah well updates aren't a thing  
Holyneo316:    and @ the davis-besse nuke plant in erie, ohio, they found a 6 
inch thick hole in the steel cap covering the plant's reactor vessel! 
DJTHRILLA2:    I am talking about a program that will reverse the sent 
program back to the sender and quarantee it on the system it was sent to and delete 
it so no harm is done  
DJTHRILLA2:    not suprising man  
Holyneo316:    u remember 3 mile island or chernobyl?! 
DJTHRILLA2:    yes  
Holyneo316:    this is serious 
DJTHRILLA2:    yes no shit  
DJTHRILLA2:    I know  
DJTHRILLA2:    making a formal proposal to take care of these viruses once 
and forall soon  
Holyneo316:    yup 
DJTHRILLA2:    have to work with some people on developing a program  
DJTHRILLA2:    NO BS  
DJTHRILLA2:    100% honest that is  
Holyneo316:    they never tell the people til its too late 
Holyneo316:    just like the radiation level in baghdad 
DJTHRILLA2:    this is not going to matter if I develop this program  
Holyneo316:    from US armor piercing shells that used depleted uranium of

THE BOOK OF HELAMAN



CHAPTER 6

The righteous Lamanites preach to the wicked Nephites=E2=80=94Both peoples p=
rosper=20
during an era of peace and plenty=E2=80=94Lucifer, the author of sin, guides=
 the=20
Gadianton robbers in their murders and wickedness=E2=80=94They take over the=
 Nephite=20
government. [Between 29 and 24 B.C.]



1 AND it came to pass that when the sixty and second year of the reign of th=
e=20
judges *had ended, all these things had happened and the Lamanites had=20
become, the more part of them, a righteous people, insomuch that their=20
arighteousness=E2=80=A2 did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their fi=
rmness and their=20
steadiness in the faith.



2 For behold, there were many of the Nephites who had become ahardened=E2=
=80=A2 and=20
impenitent and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did reject the word of God=
=20
and all the preaching and prophesying which did come among them.



3 Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy because of the=20
conversion of the Lamanites, yea, because of the church of God, which had be=
en=20
established among them. And they did afellowship one with another, and did=20
rejoice one with another, and did have great joy.



4 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did come down into the land=
=20
of Zarahemla, and did declare unto the people of the Nephites the manner of=20
their aconversion, and did exhort them to faith and repentance.



5 Yea, and many did apreach=E2=80=A2 with exceedingly great power and author=
ity, unto=20
the bringing down many of them into the depths of humility, to be the humble=
=20
followers of God and the Lamb.



6 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did go into the land=20
northward; and also aNephi=E2=80=A2 and bLehi=E2=80=A2 went into the cland=
=E2=80=A2 northward, to preach=20
unto the people. And thus ended the sixty and third year.



7 And behold, there was peace in all the land, insomuch that the Nephites di=
d=20
go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether among the Nephites o=
r=20
the Lamanites.



8 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go whithersoever they=20
would, whether it were among the Lamanites or among the Nephites; and thus t=
hey did=20
have free intercourse one with another, to abuy=E2=80=A2 and to sell, and to=
 get=20
gain, according to their desire.



9 And it came to pass that they became exceedingly rich, both the Lamanites=20
and the Nephites; and they did have an exceeding plenty of agold=E2=80=A2, a=
nd of=20
silver, and of all manner of precious metals, both in the land south and in=20=
the=20
land north.



10 Now the land south was called aLehi=E2=80=A2, and the land north was call=
ed=20
bMulek=E2=80=A2, which was after the cson=E2=80=A2 of Zedekiah; for the Lord=
 did bring Mulek into=20
the land north, and Lehi into the land south.



11 And behold, there was all manner of gold in both these lands, and of=20
silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and there were also curious workm=
en, who=20
did awork all kinds of ore and did refine it; and thus they did become rich.



12 They did raise grain in abundance, both in the north and in the south; an=
d=20
they did flourish exceedingly, both in the north and in the south. And they=20
did multiply and wax exceedingly strong in the land. And they did raise many=
=20
flocks and herds, yea, many fatlings.



13 Behold their women did toil and spin, and did amake all manner of bcloth=
=E2=80=A2,=20
of fine-twined linen and cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness. And=
=20
thus the sixty and fourth year did pass away in peace.



14 And in the *sixty and fifth year they did also have great joy and peace,=20
yea, much preaching and many prophecies concerning that which was to come. A=
nd=20
thus passed away the sixty and fifth year.



15 And it came to pass that in the *sixty and sixth year of the reign of the=
=20
judges, behold, aCezoram=E2=80=A2 was murdered by an unknown hand as he sat=20=
upon the=20
judgment-seat. And it came to pass that in the same year, that his son, who=20=
had=20
been appointed by the people in his stead, was also murdered. And thus ended=
=20
the sixty and sixth year.



16 And in the *commencement of the sixty and seventh year the people began t=
o=20
grow exceedingly wicked again.



17 For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the ariches of the=20
world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodshed;=
=20
therefore they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began=20=
to seek=20
to get gain that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they=20
began to commit bsecret=E2=80=A2 murders, and to rob and to plunder, that th=
ey might get=20
gain.



18 And now behold, those murderers and plunderers were a band who had been=20
formed by Kishkumen and aGadianton=E2=80=A2. And now it had come to pass tha=
t there were=20
many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton=E2=80=99s band. But behold, they=
 were=20
more numerous among the more wicked part of the Lamanites. And they were cal=
led=20
Gadianton=E2=80=99s robbers and murderers.



19 And it was they who did murder the chief judge aCezoram=E2=80=A2, and his=
 son,=20
while in the judgment-seat; and behold, they were not found.



20 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that there were=20
robbers among them they were exceedingly sorrowful; and they did use every m=
eans=20
in their power to destroy them off the face of the earth.



21 But behold, Satan did stir up the ahearts=E2=80=A2 of the more part of th=
e=20
Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did=20=
enter=20
into their covenants and their oaths, that they would protect and preserve o=
ne=20
another in whatsoever difficult circumstances they should be placed, that th=
ey=20
should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and their=20
bstealings.



22 And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their asecret=
=E2=80=A2=20
signs, and their bsecret=E2=80=A2 words; and this that they might distinguis=
h a brother=20
who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother=20
should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belo=
ng to=20
his band, who had taken this covenant.



23 And thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit awhoredoms=
=20
and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and also=
=20
the laws of their God.



24 And whosoever of those who belonged to their band should reveal unto the=20
world of their awickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not=20
according to the laws of their country, but according to the laws of their=20
wickedness, which had been given by Gadianton and Kishkumen.



25 Now behold, it is these secret aoaths=E2=80=A2 and covenants which Alma c=
ommanded=20
his son should not go forth unto the world, lest they should be a means of=20
bringing down the people unto destruction.



26 Now behold, those asecret=E2=80=A2 oaths and covenants did not come forth=
 unto=20
Gadianton from the brecords=E2=80=A2 which were delivered unto Helaman; but=20=
behold, they=20
were put into the heart of cGadianton=E2=80=A2 by that dsame=E2=80=A2 being=20=
who did entice=20
our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit=E2=80=94



27 Yea, that same being who did plot with aCain=E2=80=A2, that if he would m=
urder his=20
brother Abel it should not be known unto the world. And he did plot with Cai=
n=20
and his followers from that time forth.



28 And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people t=
o=20
abuild=E2=80=A2 a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven. And=
 it was=20
that same being who led on the people who came from that tower into this lan=
d;=20
who spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of the=20
land, until he dragged the people down to an bentire=E2=80=A2 destruction, a=
nd to an=20
everlasting hell.



29 Yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of aGadianton=E2=80=
=A2 to=20
still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he has brough=
t it=20
forth from the beginning of man even down to this time.



30 And behold, it is he who is the aauthor=E2=80=A2 of all sin. And behold,=20=
he doth=20
carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their=20
plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wicked=
ness,=20
from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts o=
f=20
the children of men.



31 And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites;=20
yea, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked; yea, the more part of=
 them=20
had turned out of the away=E2=80=A2 of righteousness, and did btrample=E2=
=80=A2 under their=20
feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did buil=
d=20
up unto themselves cidols=E2=80=A2 of their gold and their silver.



32 And it came to pass that all these iniquities did come unto them in the=20
space of anot=E2=80=A2 many years, insomuch that a more part of it had come=20=
unto them in=20
the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of=20
Nephi.



33 And they did grow in their iniquities in the *sixty and eighth year also,=
=20
to the great sorrow and lamentation of the righteous.



34 And thus we see that the aNephites=E2=80=A2 did begin to dwindle in unbel=
ief, and=20
grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow=20
exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his s=
tatutes=20
and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.



35 And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to awithdraw=E2=80=A2 f=
rom the=20
Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.



36 And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his aSpirit upon the=20
Lamanites, because of their easiness and bwillingness=E2=80=A2 to believe in=
 his words.



37 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of robbers of=20
Gadianton; and they did preach the word of God among the more wicked part of=
=20
them, insomuch that this band of robbers was utterly destroyed from among th=
e=20
Lamanites.



38 And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites did build them u=
p=20
and support them, beginning at the more wicked part of them, until they had=20
overspread all the land of the Nephites, and had seduced the more part of th=
e=20
righteous until they had come down to believe in their works and partake of=20
their spoils, and to join with them in their secret murders and combinations=
.



39 And thus they did obtain the sole management of the government, insomuch=20
that they did trample under their feet and smite and rend and turn their bac=
ks=20
upon the apoor=E2=80=A2 and the meek, and the humble followers of God.



40 And thus we see that they were in an awful state, and aripening=E2=80=A2=20=
for an=20
everlasting destruction.



41 And it came to pass that thus ended the sixty and eighth year of the reig=
n=20
of the judges over the people of Nephi.



THE BOOK OF HELAMAN

THE PROPHECY OF NEPHI, THE SON OF HELAMAN=E2=80=94God threatens the people o=
f Nephi=20
that he will visit them in his anger, to their utter destruction except they=
=20
repent of their wickedness. God smiteth the people of Nephi with pestilence;=
=20
they repent and turn unto him. Samuel, a Lamanite, prophesies unto the Nephi=
tes.=20
Comprising chapters 7 to 16 inclusive.







CHAPTER 7

Nephi is rejected in the north and returns to Zarahemla=E2=80=94He prays upo=
n his=20
garden tower and then calls upon the people to repent or perish. [Between 23=
 and=20
20 B.C.]



1 BEHOLD, now it came to pass in the *sixty and ninth year of the reign of=20
the judges over the people of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman,=20
areturned=E2=80=A2 to the land of Zarahemla from the land northward.



2 For he had been forth among the people who were in the land northward, and=
=20
did preach the word of God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto them=
;



3 And they did areject all his words, insomuch that he could not stay among=20
them, but returned again unto the land of his nativity.



4 And seeing the people in a state of such awful wickedness, and those=20
Gadianton robbers filling the judgment-seats=E2=80=94having ausurped the pow=
er and authority=20
of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the least=20
aright before him; doing no justice unto the children of men;



5 Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilt=
y=20
and the wicked go aunpunished=E2=80=A2 because of their bmoney; and moreover=
 to be=20
held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their=20
wills, that they might get gain and glory of the cworld=E2=80=A2, and, moreo=
ver, that they=20
might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according=
=20
to their own wills=E2=80=94



6 Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of anot=
=E2=80=A2=20
many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within=20=
his=20
breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul:



7 Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father Nephi first=20
came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have ajoyed=E2=80=A2 with hi=
m in the=20
promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, bfirm=E2=80=A2 to=20=
keep the=20
commandments of God, and slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick=20=
to=20
hearken unto the words of the Lord=E2=80=94



8 Yea, if my days could have been in those days, then would my soul have had=
=20
joy in the righteousness of my brethren.



9 But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my soul shall=20
be filled with asorrow=E2=80=A2 because of this the wickedness of my brethre=
n.



10 And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in th=
e=20
agarden=E2=80=A2 of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief m=
arket,=20
which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon=20=
the=20
tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gat=
e=20
by which led the highway.



11 And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw Nephi=20
as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the atower=E2=80=A2; and they r=
an and told=20
the people what they had seen, and the people came together in multitudes=20
that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of th=
e=20
people.



12 And now, when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people who had=20
gathered together.



13 And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them: Behold,=20
awhy=E2=80=A2 have ye gathered yourselves together? That I may tell you of y=
our=20
iniquities?



14 Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I might pour out my soul unto=20
my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of you=
r=20
iniquities!



15 And because of my amourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves=20
together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye ough=
t to=20
marvel because ye are given away that the devil has got so great hold upon=20
your hearts.



16 Yea, how could you have given way to the enticing of him who is seeking t=
o=20
hurl away your souls down to aeverlasting=E2=80=A2 misery and endless wo?



17 O repent ye, repent ye! aWhy=E2=80=A2 will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto=20=
the Lord=20
your God. Why has he forsaken you?



18 It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not ahearken=20
unto the voice of the bgood=E2=80=A2 shepherd; yea, ye have cprovoked=E2=80=
=A2 him to anger=20
against you.



19 And behold, instead of agathering=E2=80=A2 you, except ye will repent, be=
hold, he=20
shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts.



20 O, how could you have aforgotten=E2=80=A2 your God in the very day that h=
e has=20
delivered you?



21 But behold, it is to get again, to be bpraised of men, yea, and that ye=20
might get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts upon the criches and=20=
the=20
vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and stea=
l,=20
and bear dfalse=E2=80=A2 witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of=
 iniquity.



22 And for this cause awo=E2=80=A2 shall come unto you except ye shall repen=
t. For if=20
ye will not repent, behold, this bgreat=E2=80=A2 city, and also all those gr=
eat=20
cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall=
 be=20
taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will no=
t=20
grant unto you cstrength=E2=80=A2, as he has hitherto done, to withstand aga=
inst your=20
enemies.



23 For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the wicked of my=20
strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those who repent of th=
eir=20
sins, and hearken unto my words. Now therefore, I would that ye should behol=
d,=20
my brethren, that it shall be abetter=E2=80=A2 for the Lamanites than for yo=
u except=20
ye shall repent.



24 For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned=20
against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will=
 be=20
merciful unto them; yea, he will alengthen=E2=80=A2 out their days and incre=
ase their=20
seed, even when thou shalt be utterly bdestroyed=E2=80=A2 except thou shalt=20=
repent.



25 Yea, wo be unto you because of that great abomination which has come amon=
g=20
you; and ye have united yourselves unto it, yea, to that asecret=E2=80=A2 ba=
nd which=20
was established by Gadianton!



26 Yea, awo=E2=80=A2 shall come unto you because of that pride which ye have=
 suffered=20
to enter your hearts, which has lifted you up beyond that which is good=20
because of your exceedingly great riches!



27 Yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness and abominations!



28 And except ye repent ye shall perish; yea, even your lands shall be taken=
=20
from you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth.



29 Behold now, I do not say that these things shall be, of myself, because i=
t=20
is not of myself that I aknow=E2=80=A2 these things; but behold, I bknow=E2=
=80=A2 that these=20
things are true because the Lord God has made them known unto me, therefore=20=
I=20
testify that they shall be.

WASHINGTON (Sept. 2) - The nation's rocky economy sent 1.4 million more 
people into poverty last year, a Census Bureau survey found. Nearly half of the 
newly impoverished were children.

Roughly 17.2 percent of children, or 12.2 million, lived in poverty in 2002, 
up from 16.4 percent, or over 11.5 million, in 2001, according to the American 
Community Survey results released Wednesday.

Overall, 12.4 percent of the population, or nearly 34.8 million people, lived 
in poverty in 2002, up from 12.1 percent, or 33.4 million, the previous year.
  >>

OK, this is getting ridiculous!...the poverty level is at
12.4% or 34.8 million americans living inpoverty, 12.2
million of which are children!...they have already used
up my generations social security money...i worked
two jobs last year: full time as an account executive
at JobNews Employment Magazine and part time at
Custom Image, however i have been shorted of my
tax refund money while the super rich got rebates!...
and just recently there have been unauthorized
transactions on my bank account due to an on-line
scam!

I thank my lucky stars, that I am not one of the US soldiers
who lost thier life in Iraq or had to succcumb to horrendous
heat and as just recently disclosed dangerous levels of
radiation, but it has abundantly clear to me that the current
regime have been abusing and taking advantage of the 
younger generation for selfish and greedy means!

why are we spending more money (billions) in Iraq than America
when some many people are in poverty, many of which are
children or my generation...they have hiked tuition and 
want to increase other rates...why do the young, the poor, and
the working class being made to pay for the sins of Bush?!

Daniel 12

And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a 
time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation
even to that same time: and at that time shall thy people be
delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book.

Well apparently his emotional experiences aren't anything compared to 
persecuted minorities, so therefore they are invalid.

YOU LOSE NICK!

i remember pussy trance in 1998 blowing ravers minds and just totally 
getting everone psyched about techno music, but then again it might have 
been all the e-pills

i also remember all the kids listening to astral projection and goa non 
stop all the time, there was no funk-blueprint-stealing involved, just 
speakers-blasting-psy-trance-all-over stuff. still there are people 
listening to trance, and tere is no connections to detroit or funk that

Its not one or the other. That wasn't it for me, maybe for someone else.

Drugs enhance things that you already take pleasure in when you are sober... 
and perhaps they relax the body and open the mind to easier accept things 
they might otherwise not think they would enjoy?

--
It sucks to hear music you don't like on a bad day.

...but sometimes on a really good day I might enjoy music I couldn't get 
into before, and feel awesome when I hear music I already know and love. It 
feels even better to open yourself up to something new and exciting on a day 
thats already awesome.
--

Not that drugs are the answer to a closed mind, or an answer to anything, 
but I wouldn't rule out the possibility of such benefits. Such are the 
benefits of anybody having a good time regardless of what they are doing... 
and if drugs are how someone has a good time (without harm to themselves or 
others), then who is to stop them?

Someone wrote the music, so obviously someone likes it. Sometimes it takes a 
change in perception to see it other peoples' way.

Why has most or all of my favorite music been created by artists who were 
and probably were using copious amounts of drugs? I dunno.


>still there are people listening to trance, and tere is no connections to 
>detroit or funk that are assumed.

I personally don't believe in nullifying a person's good experiences with 
music based on what particular genre they are listening to. I don't respect 
that kind of arrogance. I respect the fact that people are different and 
like different things. Who am I to say that their emotions are false? They 
aren't.

I think it is unfair to generalize people into a band of ignorant thieves 
out to exploit the work of others. Thats rude. I wouldn't be so obtuse to 
think that the human race as a whole should delve deep enough into their 
respective musical taste as opposed to just enjoying themselves for the here 
and now.

Wouldn't it just be more peaceful if we let people listen to whatever they 
enjoy and be done with it?

The fact that it may have been originally exploited is uber lame, but if 
nobody "reinterpreted" someone else's music, and there was only one form of 
it, I would be completely fucking bored.

George Carlin: "Unless you are clacking together two items that haven't been 
clacked together before, you are stealing someone else's music"

...and the fact that the white man profited off of some of it is why racism 
is the problem, not the pleasant experiences people have with the music they 
are listening to.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

I meant to say "would". Of course I think they should, but you can't expect 
everyone to like music like we do.

Lots of people are happy with what is given, or "fed" to them. They feel no 
need to search for it. Good for them.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

thats right. being fucked over from the get go because of 
something you cant control isnt equivalent to people following you 
around a store because youre "carrying a skate board". im fucking 
offended that he would even try to compare this. last time i 
checked people werent being lynched just 50 years ago for carrying 
skateboards.

white people would be funny if they werent always trying to martyr

<<thats right. being fucked over from the get go because of something you cant control isnt

I'm "fucking offended" that you (and many others) continue to insist that every white person
everywhere is guilty of the oppression of black people in America. I'm white and I can't change
that, and if a black person chooses to hate or disrespect me solely because I'm white then they are
PRECISELY as guilty of racism and hatred as those they claim to rail against.

My ancestors weren't stick-in-the-ass puritans nor were they plantation owners. My great great
grandaddy didn't own any slaves.

I didn't take blues from black folks and sell a cool 50 million records to a white audience.

I'm sick and tired of being told that I'M the reason this shit happened in the past and continues to
happen today. I'm not, I never have been, and I never will be.

And no matter how much you may want it to happen, you will not even the score for 4 centuries of
black oppression by lathering me up in white guilt and slow roastiing me and everyone else over the
coals of past and present transgressions.

Your arguments cease being valid when they become counter-intuitive to the process that you're
trying to support....that is....you're not doing anything positive about it, you're merely spouting
the OPPOSITE of 'white power' hate speech. With this series of emails, you're doing just as much to
drive a wedge between the two races as someone in a hood burning a cross.

....for the simple fact that YOU'RE. NOT. HELPING.

I read the words you're typing, Tom, but all I really hear is you saying "I'm Tom, I'm White, and
I'm really sorry...."

You make a good point.

I was just referring to...

If I get my hand cut off and you get your arm cut off... i mean, it fuckin 
blows that your arm is cut off but we both lost a body part. The fact that 
you lost an arm doesn't mean I don't miss my hand.

Nick S has feelings too!

awwww.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Hey Trout I think this is another Stevie-T banter and I think this is a list

Sorry to hear about your car.  That really sucks.  It was a fun night. Tejada dropped some really good music, and the heads were definitely out in full force!  So nice to see everyone by the way.  
 
We'll catch you next time Chris.  Thanks.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} how was abbasso

Tejada played a bomb set...all over the techno board
with little flavors of the occasional break, chicago
house, and tribal stuff thrown in...never lost the
groove or sounded like he was fishing though, which i
really liked.  He was probably one of my two or three
fave shows of the summer.  

Had fun hanging out with everyone and not getting
sloppy drunk for a change as well...it's nice to
remember an entire set the next day:P

to make the analogy a bit better, it would be like me cutting my 
own arm off because i chose to and you getting yours cut off in a 
war. the injuries are the same, but the reasons for them are much 
different. choosing to do something and having no choice in 
something are very very different ballgames.

wrong, im not sorry. im pissed. pissed that im stuck looking like 
the fuckheads who pull this bullshit. and im not trying to drive 
any wedges. im trying to enlighten people to the finer points of 
racism. just because slavery is over and jim crow laws have been 
repealed doesnt mean shit is equal, though many white people 
(ignorantly) assume that it is. and it has nothing to do with 
guilt. you shouldnt feel guilty if youre not doing anything. you 
should however be fucking pissed off and want to murder the 
fuckers that continue to fuck over minorities because of the color 
of their skin. if you dont, to me youre existantially useless. you 
sitting there allowing it to happen without saying anything is 
plain old apathy. which is a bullshit stance to take on an issue 
this important.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} I swore I wouldn't hop in on this thread....but...

<<and im not trying to drive any wedges. im trying to enlighten people to the finer points of

In the language you're using and the points you're making, you're trying to drive the point home
with an axe to the forehead.

You're speaking against "bullshit racism" with MORE bullshit racism.

Injecting racial issues where issues of race are otherwise insignificant (i.e. the talent of a
musician or songwriter) is EQUALLY as racist as not hiring someone because of their skin color. It
may not be as outwardly damaging or sociopathic, but you're employing the same mental processes.

<<you sitting there allowing it to happen without saying anything is plain old apathy. which is a
bullshit stance to take on an issue this important.>>

And this is better than what you're doing?

All you're doing is turning a white supremacist argument around 180 degrees. You're like that Daniel
Carver whackjob on the Howard Stern show who keeps shouting "Wake up, white people..."

You're shouting at the top of your lungs about injustice, but you're not offering a solution to a
problem. You're not even offering alternatives.

You're merely stating (ad infinitum) that black artists are superior to white artists...then you
come off with some more rhetoric about oppression and theft of artistic devices, and you now you
claim to be supporting some sort of cause? Please.....

And then, to pour a little wine into the hole where your sword went, you tell people like Jes and
Nick that their experiences are trivial in comparison to that of a black man! And you call what
Colin said "insensitive, racist" comment, not realizing that every word you've spoken in this thread
has been equally as ignorant.

This whole thing is CLASSIC, and it's exactly why the so-called "empowerment organizations" (read:
Rainbow Coalition, etc.) have failed miserably for DECADES:

You attempt to rally people to your cause and when they try to empathize, to find a unifying factor
that may bring the people together, you whack them over the skull with an iron bat and say, "Because
you're white, your experiences are nothing compared to what my friends/my people wake up with every
day."

Fuck that, Tom. That's racism. That's propaganda. That's useless rhetoric.

And the sickest part is, as I've told you before, I've agreed with your core argument from the
beginning: that white artists have taken black art and made it their own.

Where you lose EVERYONE is by radicallizing the issue and isolating yourself against the very
audience you're trying to reach.

Racism is racism, it doesn't matter which team you support.

Tom; question for you.

I hear that group x is biased heavily against group y, for some reason not
group y's fault.  You think that I'm useless if I don't get really,
really, upset at this.

Everyone knows that there are some people who don't like blacks.  White.
Asian.  Indian.  Russian.  Jew.  Hispanic.  Whatever.  There's no place on
Earth I've seen yet where the people aren't biased against someone.

I don't like racists.  But thankfully, generation by generation, they're a
dying breed.  And I'm happy about that; I don't think I could do better
than is being done.

I'm just curious; instead of yelling at us all that we're doing nothing,
telling us that we're useless, and assuming that we think whites and
blacks are equal,

"What should we do?"

Tom, so who are you going to kill first.  Before you go on a rampage of everyone on this list, STOP.  You complain about color, women have been the most opressed group throught the world since the bgeinning of time.  how do you think "lil people", they are not even big enough to be opressed.  
Sure, lets start killing people, sounds like you know exactly what to do.  Wait, hold on a second.  Does anyone have a noose we can give to tom, i think tom could start by killing himself.  You may feel that color creates opression, to an extent that may be true, but it is only the difference maker.  It is the covering on the cake.  Color will only separate us by sight, but what you are not seeing makes all the difference.  Its not what we speek out about, its not donating money to the NAACP, nor is it worth being angry about just to help you sleep well at night.  Justify your cause by acting responsibly and forgetting about color all together.  True racism is only the cause of fear of difference, to speak out is to show your lack of action, to act, well, hopefully you can figure that out.  
Tom you may want people to support you and your so-called belief, but quit talking about it.  I dont think I have heard anyone speak of something with such lack of understanding in my life.  
Spend a week in the ghetto, see what the otherside goes through.  Do you think some kid in the ghetto cares what you have to say on this list.  So do us all a favor and shut the fuck up.
 
The Doctor has spoken,
 
ps  Tom its time for your weekly herpies test  


 

wrong, im not sorry. im pissed. pissed that im stuck looking like 
the fuckheads who pull this bullshit. and im not trying to drive 
any wedges. im trying to enlighten people to the finer points of 
racism. just because slavery is over and jim crow laws have been 
repealed doesnt mean shit is equal, though many white people 
(ignorantly) assume that it is. and it has nothing to do with 
guilt. you shouldnt feel guilty if youre not doing anything. you 
should however be fucking pissed off and want to murder the 
fuckers that continue to fuck over minorities because of the color 
of their skin. if you dont, to me youre existantially useless. you 
sitting there allowing it to happen without saying anything is 
plain old apathy. which is a bullshit stance to take on an issue 
this important.

Subject: {pb-cle} not expecting the Spanish Inquisition

Hey, all you in Cleveland-Pittsburgh,

You bringin' me DOWN with all this bickering. This is NOT the way I want to
remember living in Cleveland.

Make me jealous of having left for Ireland - not grateful of having left.
Where's more words about the good times?

I wasn't expecting the Spanish Inquisition.

Sincerely,
Chris Connell-Skurkey
5 Milltown
Dingle, Co. Kerry, Ireland

I lived in the heart of the ghetto, they dont give a shit what you say on here or out there, so give it up.  they care about your actions

"Thomas D. Cox, Jr." <death@andythepooh.com> wrote: please, feel free to step off my dick. "spend a week in the 
ghetto". you fuckin moron. maybe you feel the suburban pressure 
but i spend just about all my time in the city and i interact with 
people from many nationalities and many levels of income, 
including many poor black people. and none of them has ever said 
to me "gee tom, youre wrong. white people are alright, they try 
their best". never. so until they say that, ill keep doing what i 
do. thanks for your advice though, its probably be better used to 
shove up your ass.

not seeing makes all the difference. Its not what we speek out 
about, its not donating money to the NAACP, nor is it worth being 
angry about just to help you sleep well at night. Justify your 
cause by acting responsibly and forgetting about color all 
together. True racism is only the cause of fear of difference, to

you can figure that out.

i cant understand this last sentence. anyway, in reguard to women 
i support women fucking up oppressive men for sure. howeve 
considering they make up a consistant 54% or so of any given 
population combined with the fact that they have come up quite a 
bit more than any given minority race in this country ill leave 
speaking about that to them. 

>Sure, lets start killing people, sounds like you know exactly

youre too witty.

i sleep well every night. im angry because i dont like whats going 
on.

youre such a fucking moron. 

>True racism is only the cause of fear of difference, to speak out 
is to show your lack of action, to act, well, hopefully you can 
figure that out.  

ive acted: beating up nazi fuckheads, discussing my point of view 
in any given forum, calling people on their racist bullshit to my 
own detriment, etc. i really think my actions speak for 
themselves. 

>Tom you may want people to support you and your so-called belief, 
but quit talking about it. 

um, no. how about that?

?I dont think I have heard anyone speak of something with such 
lack of understanding in my life.  

cant hear yourself speak, eh?

>Spend a week in the ghetto, see what the otherside goes through.  
Do you think some kid in the ghetto cares what you have to say on 
this list.  So do us all a favor and shut the fuck up.

why is it about some "kid in the ghetto"? is that what black 
people are to you? no suprise. oddly, even black people who DONT 
live in the ghetto can speak about racism towards them. "spend a 
week in the ghetto". youre fucking priceless man. 

>ps  Tom its time for your weekly herpies test  

i wear a rubber when i put my cock in your mom's asshole so i 
should be okay.

If you're going to post shit like this, please...start a new thread.

I feel dirty having this posted in a thread I am responsible for creating....

fave shows of the summer. 

Had fun hanging out with everyone and not getting
sloppy drunk for a change as well...it's nice to
remember an entire set the next day:P

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE
Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred 
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each other. 
These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we danced all 
night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower ourselves as one 
tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the power of these sites was 
released into our bodies, giving us strength and connecting us to Gaia. Then 
the religions of fear took hold. They destroyed our sacred sites and our 
rituals, burning all who dared to question. But the power could not be 
suppressed forever and the great cycles of time have brought us full circle to 
this new moment and we gather once again. The ancient memory has been 
reawakened, the all night dance ritual has returned. We are once again 
experiencing the mystical power of the Trance.

But even the Happy Hardcore in 1998 was pretty cool.  :)

Seriously, before it became massively overproduced (1997-1999?), trance
was pretty fucking cool.

Odds of getting anything close to the 'true' story are pretty slim.  But
you should mention the time Bad Boy Bill was killed in a driveby shooting,
just to be complete.

you posted it in a public place, i dunno if you can claim copyright on

SCENE HISTORY - Cleveland has always had an extensive underground 
history mostly due to a slew of dance clubs in the flats. it was clubs 
like Alterhouse (now defunct), the Aquilon (now The Whiskey, formerly 
Smart Bar), Noisemakers (now the Boiler Room), and Metropolis (now 
Trilogy) that basically introduced the techno sound to Cleveland. And it 
was club dj's like John Lozecki, Geoff Maddock, Joshua Hall, and Justin 
Malesky that spun at these clubs.

The first person to throw an event outside of a club in a warehouse was 
a promotor by the name of Trout Soup. His first event featured DJ 
SquirrelNuts and Momar (before they became C & C Music Factory). This 
happened in '89. He threw a few more events, but they were not raves 
they were house partys.

Then after returning from a trip from LA, Noisemaker club promotor DJ 
Geoff Maddock had a go at it in '91. He along with Joe Carse and Jonah 
McAllistar threw two TRUTH parties in Noisemakers. Over 500 club kids 
attended this club party. but alas it still was not a rave.

The first person who attempted to throw a rave was a college radio dj on 
WRUW at Case Western Reserve University by the name of Tom Cox. He along 
with fellow WRUW dj Andy Bradford, WUJC dj Josh Banyas, and WUJC dj Ian 
Paul attempted the first rave in cleveland on March 20th, 1992. 
Unfortunately it was busted before it could happen.

However one of the dj's that was supposed to spin at that rave - Geoff 
Maddock ended up teaming up with DJ Ike Jones to form Tone Deaf and 
Color Blind Productions. It was Tone Deaf and Color Blind Productions 
along with Ray Gun that threw Cleveland's first official rave - TIDAL 
RAVE on June 21st, 1992. The event was held at the Aragon Ballroom and 
featured a live performance by the Army of Angst. Eventhough 750 people 
attended the party, they still lost money.

Their second event - KOOL AID in July of '92 featured a live performance 
by Technotronic and Dj's Reliant, Dr. Cut-ups, Ike Jones, and Count 
Zero. The event took place in a warehouse near East 4th & Prospect. 
almost 1000 kids attended the event & they almost broke even. Seeing 
that rave promoting was not all that profitable, Geoff and Ike went back 
to club dj'ing at the Smart Bar.

One other promotor worth mentioning is Brian Reid. Brian moved to Akron, 
Ohio from Germany in '88. It was he along with DJ Firehose and Dan 
Wyrostek that threw Akron's first rave - A MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT on June 6, 
1992. The headliners were Tom Cox and Geoff Maddock (Dr. Cut-ups).

A few underground events were thrown by the Firehose, Sooper Wack (which 
wuz Andy Bradford now DJ Jew-Bat), Funky Alien Gizmos (now Dreamer 
Productions), Centrak Lasers, and other promotors. But none were very 
succesfull.

It wasn't until Reliant aka Tom Cox, Geoff Maddock, and Bill the Donkey 
threw REBIRTH on August 13th, 1994 to celebrate the opening of Eat My 
Records at the Grays Armory was the Cleveland rave scene brought back to 
life.
800 ravers were treated to the likes of Relaint, Dr. Cut-ups, the Army 
of Angst, Hazey, 7up, Count Zero, Trout Soup, Joe Carse, & the Andy 
Bradford Ate All My Records Dj's.

After throwing afterhours at the old church off of Superior St, PBS made 
enough money to throw their first party - BULLSHIT! on April 1st, 1995. 
They were also the first production crew to bring west coast dj's Sasha 
and John Digweed and Paul Oakenfold to Ohio. BULLSHIT! held the record 
for greatest attendence w/ 42 kids 'til Brian Reid of Underground Penis 
Society threw FAMILY AFFAIR on July 1st thru 3rd, 1995 with 2400 kids. 
But that was in Canton, Ohio.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Technoir Audio in the Post-Gazette

i'm thinking everything is gonna be a race card with you tom.....?
WTF?

"*Techno group hopes its sound plays a role in fighting racism"

an odd title for an article that holds off till the end to talk about it.

anyhow i wonder what people reading it will think of them talking about 
selling 700-800 copies of a record?  when in mainstream a record would 
need to sell millions to be a  big seller?
i think selling 7-800 in a week is great, but what will the people 
reading the gazette think?
food for thought i guess.

i didnt write the headline or the article, and it is discussed
much more than just at the end.

front color page of the magazine section with both pictures really
big and in color at the top of the page. they obviously thought it
was some cool shit.

Correction: White man in techno group hates white people.  Rouses contempt 
amongst blacks against whites in an attempt to fight racism.  Blacks end up 
hating him with all the white people he told them were bad.

nice work.

Maybe some of this Techno blab will leak into Cleveland...
On 2nd thought, probably not. The last time I remember Scene or something to
a Techno article was when Crystal Method was touring. Blah.

im pretty sure some redneck from New Castle and some
asshole brother from the Hill arent going to be
savoring some chamomile tea while discussing the
production of the new Ectomorph track. it would be
very nice tho. i think what fights racism more would
prolly be a deeper bond between people. maybe that
deeper bond was the reason that people get into techno
or any other non mainstream music. that reason goes
beyond color.

i think people wont give a fuck unless they know
something about techno in the first place. and that
goes for anything that people dont know about.

dont want to sound negative. it is very cool that you
all got a nice write up. gongrats!

does cleveland still have any techno labels? i cant remember if
dan curtain still lives there or not. anyway, start a techno
collective with a bunch of awesome deejays and some excellent
producers and put out a bunch of records and i bet you could get
some coverage in the plain dealer or whatever its called. these
guys have broken their backs for years while getting nowhere near
the love they deserve in this town and it makes me damn happy to
see them get this kind of exposure.

Actually, I was referring to your attitude on the list.  I didn't read the 
article.  Yes, reading is very difficult for me.  I never made it past high

Well, as tom mentioned, he's not in technoir and he didnt write the
article nor the title.  I'm not aware of any of the technoir crew really
trying to play any race cards.   I think the title is derived from the
fact that "techno" goes across all social, racial, cultural etc divisions
that tend to exist in maintream culture (or are perceived to exist in
pittsburgh).

I don't know trout, but I think being able to sell 800 copies of the first
record of a new label is a pretty big accomplishment in a scene where
vinyl sales are decreasing year after year since 99/2000, and most
distributors don't take a chance on new labels until release 2 or 3.  I
would encourage anyone on here to try to do the same with electronic music
and see how easy it is?  Not saying there wouldn't be success.. but you
would see how hard it really is, as I'm sure some of you actually do know
from experience.

To put it into perspective, for me personally, I have walked into record
shops in 4 seperate countries - Ireland, Scotland (granted both are in the
UK), Austria and Switzerland.  For the first two, I had copies of TNA001
on promo, it wasn't released yet, but the people had heard of Shawn, and
Hypervinyl (or his releases on 7th city or x-trax) and had some of shawn's
records.  In Autria and Switzerland, in multiple shops, people not only
had Technoir records (and the records were present in the bins), but in a
non-electronic record store one guy even came up to me, when he saw the
technoir shirt I had on and asked if it was related to the label at all,
and began raving about the records.

So 800 copies.. maybe it's not the million that bands with MTV coverage
sell, or the latest bedrock single, but I think it's a good start.  And to
read that something like that is happening in a city like Pittsburgh would
put a smile on my face, whether I care about techno or not.

Of course the did. Slap the word Racism on the subject title and throw it on the front page. I'm sure it will grab alot of attention.

hey i said i thought it was great, just wondered how non-raver types 
would read 700/800 records, i suspect they'll just think its nothing.

i know how hard it is, my friend pressed up 1000 records, the 
distributor took 500 and sold them over a month and he had 500 records 
to give away.
he went with 1000 because the price break made it little more than 500.
he probably is still giving those away to whoever will take them!

Subject: {pb-cle} weak

Man, I thought you guys would be excited about this!  For *years* I've
been on this list and have read about and experienced how frustrating it
is trying to get past the bullshit tweaked out image that the media gave
raves and getting to the heart of the matter: the MUSIC.  the PEOPLE. 
That's what it's all about, right?  So, instead of waiting for the
mainstream media to try to understand what we're about, I went to them
myself and got them to listen to what a bunch of "ravers" had to say. 
Trust me, I would have done it sooner, but it just didn't work out that
way.  I had to get my degree and do my internship and whatnot.  I called
the PG and said, "Look, I know these guys who've started their own techno
label and are doing relatively well.  They really deserve some
recognition.  I'm a writer and I want to help them out."  That's how this
whole article got started.  I really thought that everyone would be
saying, "Wow, techno got some mainstream respect and one of our *own*
people helped that happen."  DIY, motherfuckers.  Instead you guys had to
get all ugly about it.  Granted, it's kind of predictable for me to be
defensive about it since it's my article, but I still think there are a
few things that need to be cleared up.
There a couple of points that I want to address directly.
Trout: "i'm thinking everything is gonna be a race card with you tom.....?
WTF?"
Like Tom already cleared up, he did not write the article or the headline.
 I wrote the article, the PG wrote the headline.  He posted the link to
the pb-cle because he was on the computer before I was.  I have to wonder
if it would have generated the same kind of reaction if I had just posted
it myself, or if one the Technoir guys had posted it.
Jea Leigh: "Of course the did. Slap the word Racism on the subject title
and throw it on the front page. I'm sure it will grab alot of attention.
Cheap."
Ow.  You have to understand the audience of this piece.  The PG is not a
music publication.  While the article is in the A&E section, the PG's
readership by and large isn't the most cultured of folks, certainly, at
least, not the type of people who would read a 1,500 word article about
the ins and outs of techno.  If this piece were in XLR8R or URB or
Bassline it would be completely different.  So, while the music was the
overall focus of the piece, the PG was more interested in the actual
people in Technoir and what is important to them.  You may think it's
"cheap" that we talked about racism for a good portion of the interview,
but it's true.  Pittsburgh is segregated.  Simple fact.  It's not
official, it's not enforced by law, but it's there.  Perhaps what I should
have stressed in the article is that the Technoir guys, and I have to
agree with them, feel that this segregation is part of the reason that the
city has such a hard time keeping cultural things going: lack of mass
appeal and the numbers/money to keep them afloat.  That's an issue that
the Technoir guys are passionate about and they think that it's a positive
move that an Asian guy, some black guys, and some white guys can work
together for techno because of its diverse roots.
As far as personal approaches to racism, I think an open dialogue about it
is healthier than just trying to ignore race altogether.  Get all the ugly
stuff out, ask questions, make an effort.  It might be a shame that racism
is still an issue in 2003, but it is.  I don't know what else to tell you.
I will admit that I was a little surprised to see racism as part of the
headline, but I imagine PG readers need a little more to draw them in than
just techno.  Perhaps that approach lacks some integrity, but it's still
effective.
Trout: "hey i said i thought it was great, just wondered how non-raver
types would read 700/800 records, i suspect they'll just think its
nothing."
Eh, maybe.  But Pittsburghers these days will be pretty proud of anything
that is "from Pittsburgh."  If anything they might be impressed that
people in Europe, etc., know that Pittsburgh exists and that some goofy
guys make techno there.  It's all about trying to find an identity outside
of the sports/steel/failed dot com image.
Dave Clevr: "im pretty sure some redneck from New Castle and some
asshole brother from the Hill arent going to be
savoring some chamomile tea while discussing the
production of the new Ectomorph track."
No.  I don't think that was the goal though, either.  All they're trying
to say and all that I'm trying to convey is that Pittsburgh needs to
change.  Maybe we're forty years behind the civil rights movement, and
maybe we're way late in giving techno the props that it deserves but
that's no reason to just give up. Wouldn't you say those are two things
worth hanging on to?
(Asshole brother?)
"i think people wont give a fuck unless they know something about techno
in the first place."
Maybe.  But maybe 2 or 3 people who didn't know about it before will be
interested now.  Maybe not.  You can laugh at me and the Technoir guys for
having that kind of optimism.  That's fine.  A journey begins with a
single step and all that.
Anyway, like I said before, I doubt that the article would have caused
such a ruckus if Tom hadn't been the first person to post about it.  Any
other misunderstandings about the motivation of the article can be chalked
up to me needing to strengthen my writing and communication skills.  Dig?
For a bunch of people who at one point or another believed in PLUR, you
all have a strong tendency to look at something positive and pick it apart
until its curled up on the floor, naked, shivering, and bleeding from the
asshole.  Chill out, for chrissakes.  Take some epills.  Something. ;-p 
If nothing else, come out to Havana tomorrow night.  We'll get our
non-racist orgy on to some techno.
Kelly

while all the tracks are top-notch, i'm gonna have to
say "my testimony" does it best for me. i love the
spaced out dubby "what was i worried about again?"
type music sometimes.

Hardscience and Liquidvinyldjs.com are very pleased to bring you an event 
we've been planning for over 1 year.. the event many of you have been asking 
for..

OVERLOAD 3
Friday, October 10th and Saturday, October 11th!
ALL AGES / 2 Days of Fun - Music - Friends!
2000 Capacity / Beautiful Outdoor Location!
$1 Presale Tickets!

This event means the world to us, and we want it to mean the world to you 
after it's all said and done! Be prepared to come out and have a great 
weekend listening and dancing to your favorite DJs, being among great 
friends and above all else.. having fun! DJs joining us for the weekend:


OVERLOADED HARDCORE AREA:

| MARC SMITH (Notorious Vinyl/Bonkerz : Glasgow, Scotland) *FIRST USA 
APPEARANCE!*
Marc is truly a legend within the UK hardcore scene. Hailing from Scotland, 
where if it's not hard they don't wanna hear it, he is always one of the 
hardest. Playing all throughout Great Britain and most of Europe, he is 
widely known to drop some of the hardest hitting material around. With such 
anthems as "Boom Pow", "Encounters", and "Identify The Beat", along with 
countless others on labels such as Clubscene, Bonkerz, Mainframe and his own 
Notorious Vinyl, Marc has continued to push a sound he has both originated 
and pioneered. Please join us as we are proud to present Marc Smith for his 
first USA appearance!

| STARGAZER (Phase 4/Raw Elements/Elation : London, UK) *FIRST USA 
APPEARANCE!*
In the last two years, Stargazer has proven to be one of the busiest 
hardcore producers in the UK.With several releases under his belt on his own 
label Phase 4, along with appearances on Elation, Raw Elements, Raver Baby, 
and too many engineering credits to mention, the secret is definately out 
that he is the fastest rising producer in the UK Hardcore scene. One of the 
few remaining secrets about Stargazer's incredible talent is his DJing, as 
he rarely plays in the UK due to his busy engineering schedule. This is a 
very rare DJ appearance and FIRST USA APPEARANCE for this amazingly talented 
producer!

| OMAR SANTANA (H2OH Recordings/Moonshine/Topaz : Los Angeles)
This man really needs no introduction. Widely recognized throughout the 
world as one of the USA's top Hardcore DJ's and Producers, Omar Santana is a 
full force to be reckoned with. When he's not touring such far off places as 
Holland, Italy, Spain, Belgium, or one of his many stops here in America, he 
is in the studio writing material for his top Hardcore label - H20H 
Recordings. We are proud to welcome Omar Santanafor a very rare Northern 
California appearance.. so get ready to rock.. and ROCK HARD!

| CLOUDSKIPPER vs. DJ SPREE (Raw Elements/Liquidvinyldjs.com : SF vs. 
Sonicfury.net/Spreeandadb.com : Minneapolis - CLOUDSKIPPER CD RELEASE!)
Quite possibly the most popular and talented Happy Hardcore DJs in the USA.. 
there is little doubt that comes to mind when you ask the fans of these two, 
which stretch all across the world! Cloudskipper and Spree were the 
beginning of Hardcore to many people, especially here in the USA, and over 
time their sound and style have developed into both of them being the most 
respected Happy Hardcore DJs in America. They will be coming out to perform 
together for the first time in 2 years here on the West Coast.. this is the 
one set for all the Harder and the Happier not to miss!

What mood is that?  If your happy, have a drink.  If your sad, have a
drink.  If you want to kill someone, have a drink.  If you would like to
go out with me, have a drink :)

Subject: {pb-cle} PITTSBURGH: 2 Month Review

So I've been in the burgh now for a little over 2 months.  Met 
alot of shocking people that I had not seen coming I would get 
along as well with them as what I do, then others that I had 
expected to get along with, I indeed do get along with.  

The first 2 weeks I was in town, I damn near went out every night 
except sunday, and to 2 or 3 spots on a couple nights.  This 
created my base of what I enjoy and like and support.  To be fair, 
I have not yet tried a couple of the newer nights in town (agave, 
xposed, pretty much anything at deja vu or spi bar, and some 
nights that I probably just haven't heard of, or were not 
promoted/presented to me.)  Here's a rundown of the weeklies:

The nights that are STAPLES of my week:
1) Havana (Thurs @ Havana) - Jason C has nothing but my respect as 
a promoter and moreso as great conversation.  The diversity that 
is at work while still falling under the ownership guidelines of 
the venue serves well to have something new every week.
2) Sauce - (Fri @ Lizard Lounge/Ray's) - Kelly and Cris, although 
we had that thread a while back, still get my patronage week in 
and week out due to the fact that the venue is intimate, the 
talent is solid, and the future dates keep me excited about future 
norm talley-esque vibe nights.
3) Ya Dig? aka Funk N Soul night - (Tues @ Kelly's in E. Lib) - 
Selecta and the 720 record store faithful bring the 70's funk, 
soul, and jazz life to this sit down and chill cocktail bar.  
Great for early week relaxation, and it closes at 12:30-ish so 
that my ass is in bed for work the next day at a reasonable time.

The Nights that I have supported and will continue to support 
whenever I have the inkling/adequate finances to do so:
1) Tango - (Saturdays @ Tango) - I'm honestly unsure of who runs 
this, I'm pretty sure I met them, but the martini selection there 
has long since made that information a blur.  I've seen house, hip 
hop, and drum and bass on a couple occasions.  Just usually I'm 
doing something on Saturdays/Weekends that doesnt lend me to 
support locally on saturdays and sundays, or I'd be checking this 
out more often.
2) Fuze - (Wed @ BBT) - Not to knock it at all, but there is only 
so much dnb i can listen to that is garbage, although on nights 
when I know what to expect, I'm there supporting it.
3) Electrasoul - (Wed @ Zythos) - Same as with Fuze, except on the 
prog tip, if it's someone playing TECHNO, or if it is a night that 
I want to drink some martinis, i'm at electrosoul.  In defense of 
Fuze and Electrosoul, they just happen to fall on a day when 
normally I'm trying to chill out since I'm out tuesdays and then 
thursdays, so it may just be a matter of me not have given them 
enough shots, but it's only been 2 months, and i will be at BBT 
tonight to see Jes and Adam spinning with the one they call Bagel.

Nights I'd like to check out but haven't:
#1) Mango - (Sat @ DejaVu) - Inner Child Production, that's all 
that needs to be said, which is why, when I actually have my next 
saturday free (maybe the 27th?), I'll be checking this out for 
sure.
2) X-Posed - (Wed @ SPI) - Falling on a wednesday it's cursed as 
fuze and electrosoul are that it's normally on a 'downbeat' in my 
weekly routine, but always has lineups that interest me, and 
sometime I will get around to checking it out.

Onward to the special mentions:
As mentioned earlier on PBCLETV, Technoir Audio has something 
special that no other group has exhibited to me thus far.  I was 
at the show mentioned in the article, with The Lukes, Jwan, Adam, 
and Curt playing to (at first) 6 of us, then there eventually got 
to be 20-25 heads.  That is what is weak.  This past weekend I got 
to see the movement known as Momentum.  3 Words, Dope Ass Shit.

On the rave side of things, I've only been to one here in town 
since moving, that was Phunktified... it was really fun... not 
much to say other than that.

Now we move to performers that I support fully.
1) Ed Umm - If you don't know, you betta ask somebody.  You name 
the genre, and he rocks it.
2) Technoir Cats - As mentioned above. Jwan, Adam, Shawn, The 
Lukes, Curt, Akil...
3) Tom Cox - I remember the days that listees would crack on his 
mixing, but never really made note of his track selection.  His 
shit is on-spot now, so I dont have a comparison point, I just 
wish he didnt still have the jungle mentality that if a track is 4 
weeks out of release then it's OLD and no need to play it.  One 
thought to Tom:  Play more broken beat shit out.  The 4/4 is cool 
and all, but damn man, play that 9 month old seiji record, it's 
still the bomb.
4) Selecta - Jim's got his shit together when it comes to a good 
record collection, he plays some good jams when i've seen him at 
funk n soul, and when he rocked the shit on a tuesday night at 
havana, it was off the hook.  I would like to see him doing more 
hip hop sets.
5) DC Space aka Black Mike aka Brotha Mike - I love his taste in 
lounge house, it's something I look forward to hearing every 
thursday at havana.
6) 7UP - I dont care if he's 'played out' or whatever, he's 
impressed me the 2 times that I've seen him spin here in 
Pittsburgh, once was the closing of phunktified, and once was a 
drum n bass set at tango.  He just always seems happy to be 
spinning, and I respect that passion, and the mixing is pretty on 
spot.
7) Jason C. - Yes, he's a DJ... a closet DJ nowadays.  I've heard 
a personal mix that wasn't supposed to be public and I really 
enjoyed it, ever since I've been trying to convince him to spin 
out one night, he won't listen.  Maybe Y'inz Pittsburghers can 
convince him along with me to do a havana thursday night instead 
of mike as the resident.

There are other DJ's that I support, just not to the level that I 
have for the ones mentioned.  Special Mentions should go out to 
Osmotic, Frank Glazer, Colin Pierce, DVS, Product 19, Bagel, Ryan 
Walsh (who i just heard for the first time last week, and enjoyed 
for the most part)

I'm sure I forgot someone that I support or a club night that 
should have been mentioned, but I am mainly posting this because I 
have been nothing but happy with the options that are available to 
me in this city.  I didnt have this selection in Columbus.  and as 
311 said, "I'll be here awhile... ain't goin nowhere"

Subject: {pb-cle} electric skychurch last night at peabodies

    anyone know if this actually happened?

    we were supposed to go and a friend of a friend
    called and said it was cancelled, that there was
    hip hop.

    we called the info line and got no useful info, the
    show wasn't even mentioned, but 80s night was.

    after talking to another friend today, i learned
    that the dance night was upstairs and there was
    a band there.

    just curious if anyone actually knows for certain
    one way or the other if they actually showed up
    and played or not.

    thanks!!

How do you figure he is falling off?
I think Damian is a pretty damn good DJ... and considering the state of
dance music in clubs and parties he is still on top.
What American DnB DJ is doing better?

pick any one that doesnt have a mullet or try to appeal to the 
heavy metal sqad. that would be like 5 people. being called 
the "#1 drum and bass deejay in america" these days isnt what it 
used to be. dont get me wrong im cool with damian but i just dont 
know about his music or his haircut.

Subject: {pb-cle} speaking of drum and bass

here's my btt review:

wings were not bad, especially for free, but why there's a cover 
charge where every great weekly in the city is free is beyond me. 

goose didnt show up

i dont know why other drum and bass deejays in the city bother. 
adam ratana owns every single one of you. id pick ratana for 4 
hours every week over any mixture of any drum and bass deejay 
worldwide. its just silly how good the tracks he plays are 
compared to anyone else. 

not much smoking (actually im not sure i can recall any) which 
means i dont smell like an ashtray now which is always annoying 
for me. 

the dancing people looked like a parody of the columbine kids. bad 
industrial haircuts, deep arty drawing at the table at the bar, 
and bad dancing straight outta goth night. 

so thats that. youll likely see me there again about a year from 
now or so if my current level of attendance is maintained.

Yeah, we were supposed to come out.  We both took naps so we could...but
when someone woke up from his, he decided he was just too tired.  Then
again, he has been up since 4:30 this morning.  We'll be at Havana
tomorrow.

I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO

Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

FRIDAY, SEPT. 19, 2003:

Dutch DJ, the Scumfrog, is well known for his brilliant remixes of Dirty 
Vegas Days Gone By and Kylie Minogues Love at First Sight -- a Scott 
Henry favorite in 2002.  Scumfrogs biggest fans include some of the 
worlds most respected DJs:  Danny Tenaglia, Roger Sanchez and Pete Tong.

As one of the Liberator brothers, Aaron, (like label-mates Chris and 
Julian) regularly play across the UK, Europe and beyond; however, they are 
still to be found playing at illegal parties in London most weekends. 
Aaron's style of music covers everything from underground techy house to 
hard techno, whilst keeping it funky and trippy with a freestyle attitude.

JIRAH (performing LIVE)
(Thump Radio/U.S.T.A Records - Israel - Seattle)

Jirah's debut album, Outer Access, has just been released on Israel's 
U.S.T.A Records to much critical acclaim. As well as being a resident with 
Thump Radio, Tim has performed in various cities across the U.S., Canada, 
and in Israel. He has earned a reputation for being a seamless dj and 
moving live act, transcending the boundaries of time and space and 
reaching out to touch the soul. His work is best described as energetic 
and uplifting psychedelic trance with touches of the past right along into 
the future. Tim has a true love and passion for his music which shows in 
every set he plays. We are honored to welcome Jirah as he makes his first 
east coast U.S. appearance.

heart, mind, and soul. With releases on Soular Records, they are gathering 
momentum in the North American festival circuit. Their music will bathe 
you in a lush, powerful rush of steaming beats. A booty boutique of 
musical tomfoolery and sardonic sensibilities.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

Yeah, I woke up at 4:30 yesterday morning, went to DC, came back 
in town around 8:00, then tried to grab a quick nap to make it out 
to see adam even though i was dead tired after 9 hours on the 
road.  It didn't happen, but I will see the boys at havana 
tonight, which makes up for my flake (kind of).

Whoa, there, Adam - not *all* of Ireland's in the U.K. -just the six
counties in the northeast. They had more than a few, um, confrontations (to
put it lightly) about that, for about oh, 400 years or so, as far as the
Prods vs. Catholics are concerned.

cry some more, tom.

i don't know why anyone even bothers fighting with you anymore. your 
arguments have lost all basis in reality, and now you are stooping to 
making fun of someone's haircut?

so what if you don't like it? maybe he does. but who really cares? are 
we talking about haircuts or music here? oh yea, i forgot - you are 
right about everything.

maybe we should go back to the days of hiding a dj in a booth so you 
can't see what they look like. then you would be forced to concentrate 
on something else.

this list is so ridiculous. bitch bitch bitch. cry cry cry.

everyone is entitled to their opinions, but most of the crap i have 
heard in the past couple of weeks sounds like a bunch of bitter people 
who are so unhappy with themselves they need to complain about 
EVERYTHING else to try to make their miserable lives a little better.

I'll be at this event. I will be happy that SOMETHING is going on in 
this city when so much has gone to hell recently. Bagel is a great dj, 
and I look forward to hearing him and having a good time.

I love Halloween, and October, and Fall in general. And I love going to 
well put together events. Thanks Tim and Ted for putting your necks on 
the line once again. I only hope that someday when I decide to do an 
event again, that I can get bitched at, and complained about as much as 
you.

xoxo,
dori

Speaking of Tom's haircut...I have it on good authority that Tom's going
for the box cut look (which I was unaware of).  I wasn't really sure what
that meant, until someone explained that I should think Kid n Play.  Is
this true Tom?

I will more than likely be there too, unless I have something going on
that I don't know about, like going home that weekend or whatever.  I
guess my BIG question is what should I be this year.  I think it'll be
hard to top the Dominatrix Outfit.  Far too many people wanted me to beat
them with my Riding Crop.

nah, its because it seems all tom talks about is race.  hell on a 
synthesizer mailing list he was talking race.  he posted an article that 
starts off with a headline about race.  i'm noticing a trend.

Last night I made a post about my first 2 months in town, perhaps 
you may have missed me praising all the options that this city has 
for talent and diversity.  I agree that the nights may need some 
more support on the local level, but that doesnt mean that NOTHING 
is going on in this city.  I've seen you out a few times 
supporting the local scene, what is it that has kept you 
indoors?   Is it because you don't like the music that is being 
presented to you?  If so then it's the same as when Tom thinks 
that Damien plays weak tracks that he shouldnt pay a price to 
see.  I still see Tom out supporting things at minimum 1 night a 
week, if not 2. Just because there isnt a techno-dance-rave-party 
every week doesnt mean that the town has went to shit, and I dont 
think anyone else is saying that.  What we need is more support of 
the things that ARE happening that people are missing out on.

>From what I've gathered about your own promotional activities in 
the past, you have had success.  What I have not seen is anything 
except you piping in when others are trying to make any criticism 
of other promoters endeavours.  Is it wrong to challenge promoters 
to give us what we want?  I will agree that Tom's mullet comment 
was nothing that had anything to do with a reasonable expectation, 
but I sensed the same negativity in your retort to it, as if 
because tim and ted are throwing an event, then it's worthy of 
praise.  There are plenty of nights that are struggling to bring 
out the culture that are barely getting the respect they deserve.

I had been looking for a halloween party to go to, I have a fun 
costume this year, I will be there to support this party, as I 
have with the rest of Pittsburgh's scene.  Sometimes it's not as 
much "pick and choose" as it is "support then offer up some 
criticism" to make it better.  You can go out monday through 
friday for like no money at all, easily less than $5 unless you 
consider going out as synonymous with having a couple drinks in 
addition.  

Which brings up an old point that I made that people should be 
working together more, or forming larger collectives, something to 
break up the x promoter, y promoter, z promoter does a, b, and c 
event on D night of the week, all competing for the 30-40 people 
that are out and supporting the scene more than 1-2 times a month.

The 80/20 rule applies to this city very well.  80 percent of the 
people are fair-weather supporters, while the other 20 percent are 
in it and get something out of it under all circumstances.  it's 
usually 20 percent of people do all the work so that 80 percent 
can reap the benefits.  Kill the underground/Ignore their 
influence/Choose not to support them, and soon enough there won't 
be a foundation with which to grow the community.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} weak

Eh, I don't know about that, Trout.  Do you mean to tell me that if I had
got on here yesterday morning with the link and said, "Hey, everyone, I
wrote this article about the Technoir guys.  It's a big accomplishment for
me and they're really excited about it.  Check it out," that it would have
received half of the negative attention that it did?  I seriously doubt it.
I probably would have gotten a few more, "Wow, that's really great, good for
you," comments and that would have been the end of it.  Instead, it sparked
yet another ridiculous, pointless flame war.
Look, I won't mince words, I'm pissed that you, one of my friends, totally
neglected to congratulate me and Technoir and instead just jumped to the
issue of what problems the pb-cle has with Tom.  How do you think that made
me feel?  ME ME ME.  Let's talk about ME. ;-p
That article seriously had little to nothing to do with Tom or what he
always talks about, he just posted the link.  That's it.  You just saw "Tom"
and "racism" and nothing else.

Subject: {pb-cle} speaking of cracker techno

Best white cracker night in town was at Electra Soul. I swear if there
weren't soo many damn crackers there I'd a thought it was a box of Ritz or
something. 

The best thing about all those crackers was the cracker djs and their
crackered out flavor. So sharp and raw it must have broke every fawkin
cracka in da box. Crazy cracked out cracka shit.

If one only had a choice of a box of Ritz and going again to electra soul, I
would pick Electra soul, cuz the cover is cheaper and lasts longer than
anything Nabisco puts out.

Crazy fun night, thanks again Pittsburgh cracka techno crue and co.
Shoutouts to all the crackas I bumped into, Paul, John, Wes, Mr. WINK (aka
mistah weeenk)!!!!

there is a general feeling of negativity on this list.

a lot of the reason people used to come out and
support one, two, three years ago compared to them not
coming out now is the difference between being a pizza
delivery boy and having to get up earlier than dinner
time. nothing taken away from people who deliver
pizza's.

  If so then it's the same as when

im saying that. things used to be a lot better around
here. they go up and down. they will come back up
again.... maybe in a different way. this is all in how
you like the scene and what youve experienced in the
past. pgh was much better when the techno rave parties
were going on. much. those promoters created weeklies
as well like scj, sundays at kiya, atomic, a whole
slew of shit at zythos, just to name a few. this town
hasnt totally fallen off but it aint what it used to
be. a lot of that reason, i think, is because people
grow up, or morph into different things. like bitter
assholes that have nothing better to do than complain
about shit and have perifial site blockers bolted to
their temples like a race horse. this list can suck
you in...

  What we need is

i would love to come support all these nights. hell, i
made a living doing it for about three years. come
babysit my kid and go into work for me at 7am and ill
go out and get with it. thats just my example of what
i think a lot of the fault is in the lack of support.

no. i dont think its wrong and im sure dori doesnt

i agree. dori is biased when it comes to tim and ted.
and you are right that these other cats need stuck up
for/supported as well. this is a case of tom hating on
tim and teds shit, all the time, and dori being a
friend coming to their defense. thats not wrong. i
defend my friends and im sure all of us would.

according to tom there is no underground. wich im
leaning towards agreeing with. just non mainstream
shit. thats what its called now. there is a
foundation. it was built a decade ago. we just have to
wait till the renovations are complete.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hard Rock Cafe... Dieselboy, Bagel... costume party

Basically - it's a simple answer.

Why am I not out? because i work a job that requires me to be here from 
8am until 10pm at night many weeknights, and a lot of weekends as well. 
And on top of that - I am bored with the music scene here. I can go to 
any night out of the 5 weeknights, and hear basically the same 
music/same djs at every club. They just rotate around.

There are plenty of places to go, but if I am giving up sleep on a 
weeknight to go out - I need to feel like it is justified. Not to say 
our local talent isn't phenomenal - it is. But hearing the same djs all 
the time is boring. Going to the same place every week is boring. I am 
interested in the thing at Havana tonight because it is different, but 
on the whole - most of these nights are the same, and most of the 
people who go to these nights go because their friends are there and 
their friends are playing there. That's fine. But I enjoy variety much 
more than others apparently.

I am honestly so bored most of the time I go out, that I would rather 
be home in bed. That's my opinion. Hardly anyone dances, and I can't 
tell you how many times I have heard the same conversation different 
place/different night.

And Goose, just because you and Tom are buddies now, and hang out at 
the same places doesn't mean I am not out. I am out almost every 
weekend when I am not working, supporting various places in the city.

No - everyone doesn't need to praise Tim and Ted, but they are one of 
the few people left who actually stick their necks out on the line to 
bring different talent to town. Anytime you see me piping in around 
here is when someone I know works hard is being criticized for 
something. Be that promoter/dj/whatever. Tom doesn't like Damian's 
music, great. Don't come out.

And that's the beauty of this list. If you want to cry about someone's 
haircut, and use that as part of your reasoning for not coming out, and 
try to disuade other people with holier-than-though comments, then I 
will most likely say something. I am tired of seeing people who are 
working hard being put down. And it's the same thing I said to you, if 
you have something to say - come out and say it, but by all means 
expect a response. This isn't Tom and Goose land where your word is 
scripture and no one can respond. Or because you make a post about what 
is going on in this city - I must be unaware of what there is to do 
here, and somehow wrong for thinking that something different should be 
praised instead of knocked down immediately because it doesn't fit into 
someone's definition of "cool".

Same thing as Kelly's article. All kinds of comments shooting it down, 
before half the people here even had the facts of who wrote it or was 
involved with it. LAME.

That's all I was asking.  I understand work keeping you in for the 
night, last night was my personal example, and the night before I 
was in cause I had to wake up early.  Work is work is work, that's 
a plausible reason for missing weekly events.

>And Goose, just because you and Tom are buddies now, and hang out

weekend when I am not working, supporting various places in the

Obviously you construe me and Tom to be all buddy buddy all the 
time.  Tom: when's the last time we hung out?  Tom: When haven't I 
ever called you out on any bullshit that you've said on here?  
Tom: How often would you say we have the same thoughts on things?

I go to alot of events that tom doesnt go to, about the only one 
that is somewhere that I usually SEE him is Tuesday nights, but we 
really dont talk all that much, I'm usually talking with Jason C, 
Jwan, Cris, Megan, Jim, or others there... 

What you are attacking is that Tom and I have a respect for one 
another, we understand where each other is coming from. Whether or 
not we agree, is a whole different story.  I call him out on the 
list as much as anyone else that says something that I disagree 
with, and if anyone disagrees with me, i EXPECT them to call me 
out as well.  It's a DISCUSSION list after all, isn't it?

I never slammed your praise of the event, nor knocked the event as 
well, I just stood up for the other things that are going on in 
addition to what you were praising that I felt were shown as 
inferior events.  That's your opinion if you think that, but my 
opinion is that these guys do it week in and week out, so at least 
give them a little respect.

One day a guy died and found himself in hell. As he was wallowing in despair, he had his first meeting with a demon. The demon asked, "Why so glum?" The guy responded, "What do you think?  I'm in hell!" "Hell's not so bad," the demon said. "We actually have a lot of fun down here. You a drinking man?" "Sure," the man said, "I love to drink." "Well you're gonna love Mondays then. On Mondays all we do is drink. Whiskey, tequila, Guinness, wine coolers, diet Tab and Fresca. We drink till we throw up and then we drink some more!" The guy is astounded. "Damn, that sounds great." "You a smoker?" the demon asked. "You better believe it!" "You're gonna love Tuesdays. We get the finest cigars from all over the world and smoke our lungs out. If you get cancer, no biggie. You're already dead, remember?" "Wow, the guy said, "that's awesome!" The demon continued. "I bet you like to gamble." " Why yes, as a matter of fact I do." "Wednesdays you can gamble all you want.  Craps, blackjack, 
 roulette, poker, slots, whatever. If you go bankrupt, well, you're dead anyhow. You into drugs?" The guy said, "Are you kidding? I love drugs!  You don't mean . .  ." "That's right! Thursday is drug day. Help yourself to a great big bowl of crack, or smack. Smoke a doobie the size of a submarine. You can do all the drugs you want, you're dead, who cares!" "Wow," the guy said, starting to feel better about his situation, "I never realized Hell was such a cool place!" The demon said, "You gay?" "No." "Ooooh, you're gonna hate Fridays!"

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} PITTSBURGH: 2 Month Review

Well, Ed's new here.  He moved here 2 months ago from C-bus.  So he's
still fairly excited about everything and going out.  But I am with Dori
to an extent on what she said in another post.  I get bored going out to
the same places EVERY week and seeing the exact same people and hearing
the exact same music.  Which is why I come out less frequently than my
zealous roommate.  You're right about Havana being one of the only nights
I know that gets a decent turn out every week.  If you ask me, too many
people go.  I usually end up getting severely claustiphobic about my
personal space being invaded and getting bumped into all the time.  It's
been okay cause it's been warm enough to sit outside on the orch, but that
won't last for long, and I know my presence will disappear with the warmth
of summer.  I'm just waiting for the night when I have my first panic
attack there, and that'll be the end of going out for a while.

Alright, we are going to do Velvet [insert weekday here] part 2, and maybe
some of you people who are sick of hearing the same people will actually
come out (even once?) this time?

Just kidding, I wish. I have no time and energy for that sort of emotional
rollercoaster again.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} PITTSBURGH: 2 Month Review

Hell, I'd LOVE to do something from my living room like once a month.

dont care who did it, by best friend or my worst enemy. shit i 
went out last night to a club night run by people i hate whom also 
hate me just to see my friend deejay. quit doing weak shit and ill 
quit talking shit, thats all. and its not like i cant speak from 
the position of having thrown events, ive been there. and not a 
single one of those events ive been involved with was predictable 
and weak.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Surround Sound

A query for the tech savvy on bass management:

I want to put together a home theater system with no subwoofer. The
HT-in-a-box things aren't really my style (a sub and 5 shitty tin cans), so
I just want to get a good receiver and start adding full-range speakers. The
quandry is this: am I going to get the full soundfield in my front channels
(provided that the speakers will handle it) or am I going to be FORCED to
use the LFE/subwoofer output to get t-rex footsteps and asteroids exploding?

I want a 5-channel (not 5.1) full-range setup with NO omnidirectional bass.
Is this a problem?

J.[M]

On most receivers, there is an option somewhere that you can say if 
you have the sub or not.  If not it will pass that data along to the 
front left and righ speakers.  the center and rear ones typically 
don't get bass, that's just the way the 5.1 system was designed.  but 
check into the receiver and see if it does or not.  Sometimes it 
won't even matter, the receiver will still send bass to the front 
speakers even if there's a sub attached, just that in those cases the 
speakers just don't play those lower sounds

Bring in someone with a different sound than hardstep/techstep/darkstep,
and I'll drive up.  :)  Seriously, drum 'n bass kind of started converging
sometime in 1999, as far as pb-cle is concerned.  A few of the locals
(Adam Ratana comes to mind) split from that mold noticeably, and made me
*really* happy.  Dunno.

As far as "being the best", Oakenfold is great, right?

You know... one thing I've realized is that the
darker, harder stuff has not really stood the test of
time with me. I still like it and listen to it, but
the atmospheric stuff is more timeless and I find
myself wanting to hear it much more than techsteppy
stuff. Adam Ratana is clearly the man, I like his
mixes better than any other d&b dj I've ever heard...
I even put him ABOVE LTJ Bukem cuz his mixes are more
diverse.

Not enough info on what equipment you are using... are
you using surround built into your amp or do you have
a seperate processor??? My sony amp is set up as Todd
described... def. check your manual there are prob.
adjustments you can make. The television you're using
is a factor too, I have a pretty modern sony with
several soundfield settings and they make a HUGE
difference.

Hey Josh why dont you want a subwoofer??? I bought a
big ole JBL a few years back on ebay for very
reasonable $$$ and I love it, you aren't gonna get
those deep frequencies you need with only full range
spkrs... the kinda shit that rattles the house during
light saber battles and such ;-)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Surround Sound

I'm using these Wharedale speakers I got from ubid a while back.  Has 
great sound, a lot better then when I had one type of speaker in the 
front then a different center, then different rear channels.  Has a 
passive sub and it definitely still delivers some punch, when I'm 
able to turn it up.  Freaking parents complaining about "noise" ugg, 
it's not like I'm playing a noisecore cd or something.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Surround Sound

Any decent home theater receiver should give you the ability to set the 
crossover frequency of the front speakers at multiple levels, or allow 
full-range response. My JVC allows 80hz/120hz or no crossover.

You're just limited by the frequency response of the speakers. You will also 
have to EQ out your bands because the rolloff of the speaker isn't likely to 
give you enough of a bass response to truly imitate a quality separate 
components setup.

You're not going to have zero bass though, which is what I gather to be your 
main concern.

A query for the tech savvy on bass management:

I want to put together a home theater system with no subwoofer. The
HT-in-a-box things aren't really my style (a sub and 5 shitty tin cans), so
I just want to get a good receiver and start adding full-range speakers. The
quandry is this: am I going to get the full soundfield in my front channels
(provided that the speakers will handle it) or am I going to be FORCED to
use the LFE/subwoofer output to get t-rex footsteps and asteroids exploding?

I want a 5-channel (not 5.1) full-range setup with NO omnidirectional bass.
Is this a problem?

sidetrakkt productions presents

EARTHDANCE/SIDETRAKKT 4-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

Saturday, September 20, 2003
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

a sonic psychedelic journey guided by:

JIRAH (performing LIVE)
(Thump Radio/U.S.T.A Records - Israel - Seattle)

Jirah's debut album, Outer Access, has just been released on Israel's U.S.T.A Records to much critical acclaim. As well as being a resident with Thump Radio, Tim has performed in various cities across the U.S., Canada, and in Israel. He has earned a reputation for being a seamless dj and moving live act, transcending the boundaries of time and space and reaching out to touch the soul. His work is best described as energetic and uplifting psychedelic trance with touches of the past right along into the future. Tim has a true love and passion for his music which shows in every set he plays. We are honored to welcome Jirah as he makes his first east coast U.S. appearance.

www.jirah.com
www.ustarecords.com
www.thump-radio.com

ONNOMON (performing LIVE)
(Soular Records - Philadelphia)

Onnomon's music has been described as a cinemagraphic journey for the heart, mind, and soul. With releases on Soular Records, they are gathering momentum in the North American festival circuit. Their music will bathe you in a lush, powerful rush of steaming beats. A booty boutique of musical tomfoolery and sardonic sensibilities.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hard Rock Cafe... Dieselboy, Bagel... costume party

Tom

I really dont care what you think of Tim and I.  I appreciate Dori
sticking up for us, but your opinion means nothing to me.

I have booked talent that I absolutely do not want to hear... it was my
job.  If other people want to hear someone play... then I try to book
them.  Do you love everything about your job?

I have busted my ass to bring over 100 headliners to Pittsburgh and booked
nearly all the local talent.  No, I never booked you... no regrets there.

Yes I have booked Icey, Kimball & Damian a bunch of times... so has every
other major promoter in the country.  People know who they are, lots of
people attend those nights... everyone remembers those nights.  Those
nights take away from the nights that we bring talent that you might be
more interested in.

I dont really like you or the music you play... but I do not sit on hear
and post negative things about it.  What good does that do?

Here is a list of the talent Tim and I have booked.  I made it over a year
ago... so it definitely does not include everyone.  There are lots of
people missing such as Mark Farina, X-Ecutioners, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Cirrus,
Klute, Juju...
If you do not like some of the talent we have brought... then I dont know
why you are on this mailing list.

I swear that these guys aren't on my payroll!

Seriously though, I am glad that people like what I play and that people
are expressing this.  It gives me a confidence boost because the dnb sound
I push nowadays isn't necessarily well accepted in this city or elsewhere.
As a lover of music I am pretty much fed up with 90% of the DNB that comes
out and is played (in some cases 99%).  The reason is, maybe I'm getting
older, but I like my music to be on the musical side...  to have some sort
of element in it that extends beyond a "popular" "caned by all the UK djs"
tune with a shelf life of 2 weeks.  And I think that leaves most of whats
there in the dust.  the way I think of it when I buy records is, can I
play this next month, next year, 3 years from now?  In fact I probably buy
as much or more techno or house or broken beat or other goodness ..
because good music is good music and its getting harder and harder to
find within the DNB arena.

Not to slag Dieselboy or any of the "untouchable" heroes, but I think the
difference now in their selection and what they played 5 or 7 or whatever
years ago, is that the stuff now is like fire and forget.  maybe 1% of the
tunes will be deemed classic down the line.  It's disappointing, because I
keep expecting some timeless sets when I hear them play, but for the most
part I hear forgettable sets.  Maybe the energy is there from the crowd,
and that is indeed important, but I want to hear good MUSIC .. not just
good technical skills and todays anthems that will never be played again.
I will probably take some flak for this, but im just expressing my
opinion.

good, because my opinion of you is pretty fucking poor.

ya'll couldnt afford my ass anyway. i charge fuckheads extra to
play at their nights. 

>Yes I have booked Icey, Kimball & Damian a bunch of times... 

a "bunch" of times. what a fucking understatement. please. youve
accepted your position of power with nearly no responsibility to
bring shit other than what sells. and if you can justify that to
yourselves, thats good for you. i couldnt possibly be that
shallow. getting klute and juju 4 years too late was a nice try,
but really you could have had them much much cheaper when they
were making better records if you werent just trying to make cash. 

>so has every

if every major promoter in the country jumped off a bridge, would
you too? please? 

People know who they are, lots of

thats 0 nights. i havent even considered going to one of your
nights. the last time i went was summer 00 when ratana played and
i didnt pay to get in. you guys couldnt pry my money out of my
cold dead hand.

no shit, that shows by what you bring to town. crap.

dont get me wrong i listen to just as much dnb from the 90s as i do from
nowadays(considering i have well over a thousand records, at least 400 cds,
and probably 15 gigs of jungle/dnb mp3)

when i go out i wanna hear the newest illest plates...when im chilling at
home or in the car its cool to listen to the older deeper stuff

thats just my take on things
Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

I'm not forgetting anything man.  What you might consider pushing the
envelope, I don't think you'll be listening to 90% of it next year or a 3
years from now - and for that perhaps you are wasting your money and time,
when you could instead be buying and listening to music that you will
listen to 90% of 3 years from now.  It's like the whole dubplate mentality
is really a euphemism for tunes becoming commodities rather than pieces of
music.  Ive definitely been at shows where people were playing the "illest
plates" and the difference is those sets were filled with tunes that stood
the test of time.  It's not not really happening like that now.

Good music doesn't expire. It doesn't have a shelf life.  It doesn't need
to be played by certain people to be considered "hot."

You and anyone else who wants to think I'm forgetting anything about dnb
are more than welcome to come over and listen to my collection of jungle
tunes .. on vinyl.

Subject: {pb-cle} Havana tonight


Thanks to everyone who came out tonight. I know there were a bunch of list
people there and it was good to see that some were down to hear us play.
Sorry to those who couldn't make it, or have no interest, or think we suck
because tom likes us - it will probably be a while before you have another
opportunity to get the full on experience.

Luke M. surprised the hell out of me with the guitar. that was off the
hook.  Arne dropped some serious jams.  and im too tired to really say
anything else. but thanks for the support, the people who were there. :)

Good times indeed.  Thanks to Jason for having us play there.  We had a
blast last time and we had a blast this time, it's always a pleasure.

wow. tom, you have sunk to a new low - even for you. when's the last 
time you had a part in throwing an event? yeah - that's right.

tim and ted do NOT do this to make money - they both have full time 
jobs - get that through your head. they have not made more money than 
they have spent from the "rave scene".

you are going to continue to lead a stuck up miserable life because you 
are too good for everyone around you, and too lazy to get off your ass 
and bring some of this "great" talent that you speak of. instead you 
will continue to sit on this list and run your mouth like you have some 
clue what you are talking about. maybe at one point you knew something, 
but now you are just talking shit. i honestly think you just like to 
"hear" yourself talk.

you called me biased, but i am sure that anyone on here could tell you 
how the only "good" things that go on are when you or your boys are 
playing.

maybe you should just start your own list, and include those as pompous 
as yourself - and talk about your pretentious ideals over there, and 
touch dongs, and talk about how great you all are all day long.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hard Rock Cafe... Dieselboy, Bagel... costume party

What I appreciate about a dj like
Ratana and others that I would put in
his catagory is that they spin their
passion and you can tell it in their 
mixes. Alot of dj's jump from genre
to genre, to spin the flava of the month
which is ok cuz that's what 95% of the
people want to hear anyway. But you can
tell when a dj is consumed with their
genre. It goes way beyond mixing skills,
it has to do with track selection and
picking the right track to drop at the
right time. These kinds of dj's are 
pretty rare. I like to get schooled 
when I listen to a mix. 

Ratana
Andy James
Zone

On my short list. 


Peace,
Luke

alex was talking about going to this, but backed out because of gas 
money, but then the day before he lets me know we can ride with andy 
james (grab his new cd biotch).....

that shit was on point.   lots of good techno from everyone.  met a 
couple people i've seen their names around and shit.  um the 
namedropping bit.... wes, joe from erie, remet sort of ryan walsh, 
didn't recognise him for awhile. some ppl i haven't seen in awhile were 
out.  george from lightwave, tyrell...  um, maybe others, drawing a blank?

colin did get 2 people to kiss him for free admission.  one was a dood, 
on the lips.
i told him it'd beed to be a 5$ cover before he gets any off me!  i'm 
not _that_ cheap!

chris liberator on oct 1st, i will be there.

afterwards we went to colin pierces place for more shiznitz and some 
kooky people were there--including alex.

2$ straub's is the shit.  any bar that has straub's is OKAY in my book. 
and one with it being 2$ is FUCKING AWESOME in my book.

good for them. if they really wanna see for themselves how weak

say.

he's definitely not one of the top remixers or producers. he hasnt
put out an original tunes in 3 years and even then he only
released 3, 4 if you count atlantic state. and how many rmxes has
he done? not very many. and really i dont think i need to
"respect" him because he can mix 2 weak records into each other.
lots and lots of deejays do that. i can remember going to see him
spin records when he would play fun shit, including intelligent
type stuff, jump-up-ish type stuff, jazzy stuff, afrofunk stuff,
etc. thats just not whats up with him anymore. listen to his old
mixtapes "east coast science", "witness the strength", etc and try
to tell me that he hasnt gone downhill. his shit used to be
essential.

yeah man, they totally killed it. the lukes and shawn together was
fun to hear. and everyone's selections were spot on, especially
arnie's. he played "work that motherfucker", block party, and so
many more old jams. but everyone was killing it. chris, curt,
jwan, ashwin, and adam all played fantastic joints and made them
go really well with the live shit. and luke's guitar playing was
definitely nice and rather unexpected. i was slightly
dissappointed by the smallish number of people dancing, but i
guess considering it was mostly techno and not house that it was
alright. people were definitely feeling it though, even if they
werent dancing. that had to be one of the best nights of music ive
seen at havana.

man, trying to explain this to a drum and bass deejay is useless.
spinning jungle has become like collecting baseball cards. your
card is only worth something if its rare and no one else has it.
it doesnt matter how good the played on the card is.

nice pix trouty!!! i always have a bomb time when i play at electrasoul. cheap drinks + bangin techno = MADNESS! alex gets crazy when he's drunk, so does ryan walsh. afterwards trout introduced me to his pittsburgh tradition.........primanti brothers! nothin like it after a night of drinking and techno. 
 
shouts to trout, alex, john, wes, frank, the soundguy(i forgot his name), brian b, paul, ryan, heckler guy, meeester weeenk aka josh wank, and of course the man the myth the slamdancer: colin pierce, my inspiration for slice & dice ginsu techno!!!

alex was talking about going to this, but backed out because of gas 
money, but then the day before he lets me know we can ride with andy 
james (grab his new cd biotch).....

that shit was on point. lots of good techno from everyone. met a 
couple people i've seen their names around and shit. um the 
namedropping bit.... wes, joe from erie, remet sort of ryan walsh, 
didn't recognise him for awhile. some ppl i haven't seen in awhile were 
out. george from lightwave, tyrell... um, maybe others, drawing a blank?

colin did get 2 people to kiss him for free admission. one was a dood, 
on the lips.
i told him it'd beed to be a 5$ cover before he gets any off me! i'm 
not _that_ cheap!

chris liberator on oct 1st, i will be there.

afterwards we went to colin pierces place for more shiznitz and some 
kooky people were there--including alex.

2$ straub's is the shit. any bar that has straub's is OKAY in my book. 
and one with it being 2$ is FUCKING AWESOME in my book.

Subject: {pb-cle} Hooj Choons RIP.

I don't want this to turn into a genre war, but hooj was a very respected
lable and has outlasted most:

from hooj choons website:
http://www.hoojchoons.co.uk


Dear Hooj person,

It is with deep regret that we have to inform you that Hooj Choons, as we
know it, is no more. Following two years of fairly horrendous financial
struggle, during which time we fought to trade our way out of mounting debt
problems, we've had to call in the professionals to resolve matters once and
for all.

Naturally, this has come about as a direct result of: Sept 11/ any middle
eastern conflict you care to name/ downloading/ the slump in the global
economy/ music industry/ dance music industry... No, the truth is that as
distinguished labels, clubs and magazines shut down around us, we failed to
react quickly or effectively enough to what was going on. We thought we'd
seen this happen before, and could work our way out of it, but this was a
different kind of slump.

It feels like we should write some kind of mini - obituary for Hooj at this
point, but maybe everything that needs to be remembered about us is out
there already: a hundred and thirty six releases spanning 13 years, all of
them, for better or for worse, trying to live up to our original aim of
remaining 'occasional providers of half decent house'.

(Key members of staff will be carrying on the work of hooj.com, one of the
few beacons of hope amongst the gloom of recent times, under a new name and
ownership. Please see separate Hooj.com statement for details at the top of
the message board
.
Its been a long, and until recently, enjoyable ride and we thank everyone
for their support over the past twelve years.

Yours,

The Hooj Mob

luke 2??) for that. definitely an unexpected but welcome touch. his licks were kinda bluesy, kinda
pink floydian, but either way, they were right on the money.

jwan, adam, curt and the other spinning heads from TNA that i didn't know did a fine job augmenting
without trying to steal the show or make it into a dj vs. pa scenario. likewise the live guys didn't
try to separate themselves from the group playing records. it was all-around a well conceived
concept and....should've been recorded and played for people who say techno has no emotion...

That actually turned out to be a fun weekend in 
a trippy kinda way. After Klokwork and I drove
down there to find out it wasn't happening, we
hooked up with these Columbus Kats and had
a ball (no pun intended :] 

Peace,

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Havana last night

Now that you mention it, there were very few ladies there last night.
Perhaps the dork factor was just a little too high...or Akil killed them all
on their way there.
No matter.  I had FUN last night.  I was happy to run into Lissa Richards
and Steve Bruder, old rave folks who I hadn't seen in quite a while.
I took full advantage of the complimentary libations (thank you, Jason C.
and Shawn Rudiman), and proceeded to get stupid.  I believe Adam Ratana took
a picture of Liz Janco and I attempting to imitate the dancers from Sean
Paul's videos.  I'm glad that was documented, since by that point I'm sure
that my cheeks were flushed and my hair was frizzy.
Ms. Cristina Battaglia was also present, but mostly observed from the
sidelines due to her nagging head cold.
Aside from the smattering of Shadyside Eurotrash, the turnout to last
night's event was impressive and much fun was had by all.

You should have came to the BBT when Adam was playing. I don't think Dillinga had those heads on the floor.
 
Besides, dance floor is over rated. Who wants to hear that shit 24/7. Don't get me wrong, but at times I get real sick and tired of hearing 3-4 djs play the same dance floor tunes in a month. I'll play dance floor if the shit I have hasn't all ready been played, and is actually good. If I hear someone else play the same tunes, I put those records in the throw back..
 
That's why I like the style we play. You hardly hear anyone really playing good tunes. It's always got to be the "whaaaaaaaaa wha wha whaaaaaaaaa" drum and bass. It gets old sometimes.

i never said dancefloor should be the only thing going on...i just said its 
what the majority of the heads wanna hear at big events(like dsl at the 
hardrock)

the thing about most local dancefloor dnb djs is they all have the same 
tunes cuz they all buy their tunes at the same shops...this is why i make my 
own tunes and trade them with other producers from outside the area...that 
way i always have stuff nobody else has :)

you have to step back and ask why this is. is it because they like
dancing most to what is familiar to them? thats what gets most
people going for sure. and if most people are playing hard stuff,
that limits what else can be played in the future that will be
recognizeable to people and will get them dancing. its a self
perpetuating cycle, one that seems especially strong here as
opposed to the uk where there's always been a decent bit of the
other stuff around and now it seems like its making headway into
the big events a bit. america doesnt need to be late on every

it really does. and the lack of diversity within peoples sets

the thing is you dont have to do that. look at ratana. he get

part he's playing tunes that anyone could go into a shop and just
buy.

tom, you're dumb to think that house music gets women going. 
everybody knows that trip hop is what makes chicks get sensual.  
especially when scotty boombox opens up the night.  i think 
someone out here should book him, right Paul? Celeste?

Jay Schamberg, Diplomat and myself will be taking a turn behind the decks 
tomorrow night at Cleveland's Abbasso Lounge.  We'll be spinning other 
peoples records and drinking as many tall pauls as possible.

Ironman "Paul" Fleetwood holds the unofficial record of drinking 19 and a 
half.  If you can surpass this mark, Paul will be your manservant for One 
(1) Week.

So come out for a night of good music. Tribal/tech/prog house music included 
with some obligatory breaks.

Hope to see everyone there.

19 tall pauls?  I can't even fathom that - 19 redbulls alone in one night is
amazing then add the liquor.  OUCH.

how much diversity is there in a set when a dj is only playing calibre,

ive been reading about london electricity's live shows, interviews
with lots of the people i like talking about getting more gigs.
and obviously swerve holds down the deeper sounds on a regular basis. 

>how much diversity is there in a set when a dj is only playing

those cats have more diversity within their own catalogues than
most of the rest of drum and bass has combined. 

and speaking of tech itch, that guy has fallen sooooooo far. it
hurts to even listen to his stuff. i can remember hearing "reborn"
for the first time. that shit was white hot. now they just recycle
their same sounding breaks into amen smashers. its silly. 

>id rather write my own tunes than buy tunes any day of the week.

thats not the point i was trying to make. you choose that method
to deviate from the normal sounds, but not every other jungle
deejay is going to want to or be able to do that. so whats their
excuse for playing the same old crap over and over? 

tommmmmmmmmmm

Dear Hooj person,

It is with deep regret that we have to inform you that Hooj Choons, as we
know it, is no more. Following two years of fairly horrendous financial
struggle, during which time we fought to trade our way out of mounting debt
problems, we've had to call in the professionals to resolve matters once and
for all.

Naturally, this has come about as a direct result of: Sept 11/ any middle
eastern conflict you care to name/ downloading/ the slump in the global
economy/ music industry/ dance music industry... No, the truth is that as
distinguished labels, clubs and magazines shut down around us, we failed to
react quickly or effectively enough to what was going on. We thought we'd
seen this happen before, and could work our way out of it, but this was a
different kind of slump.

It feels like we should write some kind of mini - obituary for Hooj at this
point, but maybe everything that needs to be remembered about us is out
there already: a hundred and thirty six releases spanning 13 years, all of
them, for better or for worse, trying to live up to our original aim of
remaining 'occasional providers of half decent house'.

(Key members of staff will be carrying on the work of hooj.com, one of the
few beacons of hope amongst the gloom of recent times, under a new name and
ownership. Please see separate Hooj.com statement for details at the top of
the message board
.
Its been a long, and until recently, enjoyable ride and we thank everyone
for their support over the past twelve years.

Yours,

The Hooj Mob

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hooj Choons RIP.



I did as well, although I admit over the last 2 years, there have only been 
4 or 5 releases that have been worth purchasing.  and that's out of both 
discs.  when i did find something i thought was good, i laughed at their 
tagline a little.

the last few releases just over the last 2 months (including the James 
Zabiela CD & 3LP) have been their best since late 2000 / early-mid 2001.  
just my .02  but quite a way to go out strong.

redbull... Lord knows what else, I asked and the guy wouldn?t tell me. I

{{ ~Aaron~ <aaron2000@sbcglobal.net> }
Hey Josh why dont you want a subwoofer??? I bought a big ole JBL a few years
back on ebay for very reasonable $$$ and I love it, you aren't gonna get
those deep frequencies you need with only full range spkrs... the kinda shit
that rattles the house during light saber battles and such }}

I live in an apartment, so the idea of a high-power, high-excursion,
downfiring bassdriver doesn't seem to be the best idea for me. The people
downstairs might bitch when their good China comes flying off the walls. I
still want to put together a system that can be upgraded later, so that's
why I'm avoiding HT-in-a-box setups.

*So far the plan:
Sony STR-DE895 receiver
JBL S-38II front pair (need good speakers for music)
JBL N-24II rear pair
Tring to figure out how to use the onboard WEGA speakers for my center
channel...

Agreed... and I would expect that response from
everyone on here. One thing not brought up in there
which is a huge factor, how is the machine supposed to
read the crowd, the vibe, and do anything to adjust to
the elements around it??? How could they program it to
'ad-lib' like a human can. Impossible.

You are clearly referring to the tracklist from my live @ phunktified 
set.  The right music for the right atmosphere for the right time of 
night.  If I was rocking tech itch in a _LOUNGE_ for god sake, id hope 
someone would shoot the promoter for booking me, since I obviously 
wouldn't be a good dj to play shit that
seriously grates against the setting and idea behind the room and 
timeslot.  Look at the other mix cds on the site. For the most part they 
span a decent amount of artists and "subgenres."

Nick, when I play out, if its appropriate, I try to span tech step, 
liquid funk, atmospheric and old skool if given enough time, to please, 
push and educate respectively.  For a 50-60 minute set in a lounge, I'm 
really not going to try to swing my selection that widely.  Its just my 
opinion of what a good dj is - flexible to the situation, timeslot, 
crowd and atmosphere.  If I was going to play to a crowd of "nick s" 
types, I would definitely bring the harder stuff, but then try to 
gradually take it somewhere else that they might not be used to 
hearing.  At that point, if its good music, its good music and people 
should still be dancing.  If they are fans of good dnb and the sound is 
good, it shouldn't be a problem.

And btw, I have plenty of tech itch and bad company records, including 
the white label original of the nine which I got when the members of bad 
co were only known as future forces inc and fresh and vegas.  Some of 
these records are still great.  I may even play them. The derivative 
stuff that's coming out now, 5 years later, isn't so great which is why 
I don't play it as much as I used to.

Here is a question: how good of a dj can you be if you can only play the 
type of music suited to one time of night, one type of venue, and one 
type of crowd?  Would you bring a bag of tech itch tunes to play in a 
chill lounge?  I wouldn't bring a bag of 100% funky and intelligent 
tunes to play at 2am at a rave.  As someone who plays dnb and loves it, 
sometimes I feel that even dnb isn't appropriate for all situations.

> id rather write my own tunes than buy tunes any day of the week.

I certainly wish the quality and quantity of my production was at the 
point where I could do this as well.  But still, if there is good music 
on the shelf, what's wrong with buying it?  If you only want to support 
yourself and your own tunes, then what are you into? Dnb, or yourself?

I can just feel someone waiting to call this a pissing contest.  Its 
not. I think this is a good discussion.

Subject: {pb-cle} Our disco discussion from last week....

So I went over to my friend's house tonight (the guy who founded and
originally owned poo-bas) and he was remeniscing.  He had taped sets from
every club he worked at here in Cleveland from the late seventies until
recent.  We spent some time listening to a set (not his) from 1978, recorded
from a radio mix show (WLYTE I belive - 92.3).  No village people or any
other cheese stuff in the mix at all  It wasn't the underground of the day,
but pretty close.  It showed what mixing was like back then, and it was in a
time when many dj's used feather dusters to slow records down to seque them
together.  For what's its worth, he said stuff like Kraftwerk was considered
"Funky Disco".

My question is, if I coherced him into turning this mixtape into something
digital -- would anyone be interested in listening to it online?

d



Trivia for some old fucks....

Interestingly enough (as a big Prince/Oldschool Minneapolis music fan)...
The final Lipps Inc (Funky Town) album was produced by the same guy who did
all the Prince stuff.  Memebers of Lipps Inc had gone onto become Tamara &
The Scene (a big 80's favorite of mine).

To listen to streaming, maybe. If you can get it in format for us to

Go to any record store and pick up a "flyer" it is a small mag that will
have all the event listings and things like that to check out.
Breakbeat
science on orchard st will not only have the flyer, but since they are a
DNB shop, they would also be more than happy to point you towards DNB
events.  www.breakbeatscience.com for number and address.

I suggest hanging out in washington square park and the village. make
sure
to eat some true NY pizza, theres many great places to go but the best I
recommend for a "tourist" is in Penn station, since the slices are
always
from fresh pies, due to the amount of traffic coming through there.
Rosa's is my personaly favorite there.  To me the pizza is more
important
than the club biz..

NY DNB scene really isn't too great at this point.  The best nights are
weeklies.  Direct drive might still be going on though, it used to be a
good time.  like I said check the flyer magazine, talk to the guys @
Breakbeat Science.

The Amen breakbeat is the foundation of all Hardcore (yes, jungle/dnb 
included, duh).  It was first used in a rave tune in 1987, and was looped 
over what otherwise would have been a standard Acid House tune, but the use 
of this breakbeat turned Lennie de Ice's "We Are I.E." into what is widely 
regarded as the first Hardcore tune.

It was used extensively from 1987-1993 in all forms of Hardcore throughout 
that time, and the same rang true for when the jungle/dnb style of Hardcore 
developed in early 1994.  There are many other breakbeats that helped 
define Hardcore styles over those years, but the Amen is surely the most 
prominent.

The actual breakbeat itself comes from a live recording of "Amen, My 
Brother" by a band called The Winstons, which was released on 45 single in 
1963.  It comes from the middle of the song where the band drops out and 
the drummer plays a small solo.  This song should be readily available on 
any of your popular P2P services, and I suggest listening to it, as it's 
quite interesting to hear the song that helped define a good 16 years of 
music so far.

Here's a wav of the breakbeat (mastered a bit, and taken from Zinc's site):

Subject: {pb-cle} Nice day for house music.

I'll be playing @ Twist again today from 4-9.  If your looking for something
to do this beautiful afternoon, then stop on down.

Twist is on the corner of 117th & Clifton, and it has a nice little patio
out front so its a good place to chill.   Plus its free.

Next Sunday it's misterbradleyp manning the decks :)

There is no way in he!! he had 19(at least not at abbasso)....that would be like coma-inducing amounts of alcohol.  I've seen even the hugest guys curled up in a ball after four.
 
BTW.  Adam, Jay, & diplomat--- great, great music Saturday night. That was some mad dancing in response.

Subject: {pb-cle} Drop Zone on 11/06/03- BSP 

Kind of early, but some people like to make their plans a tit bit in ahead,
even for a Thursday...



Koala Tea Productions presents?

DROP ZONE 

@ Rhythm Room

on Thursday, November 6th


DJ ODI
(G Force / Digital Konfusion / Strategic Recordings / www.eroticbpm.com  /
Well Known DJs)
New York City, NY

One of the most respected old school junglists this side of the Atlantic,
Odi has rocked dance floors everywhere he?s played. Ever since he got his
start at the famous New York City NASA parties in 1992 where he soon became
a resident, Odi eventually went on to spin nationally alongside some of the
biggest names in EDM, with AK1200, Rap, Aphrodite, Ritchie Hawtin, and
Frankie Bones to name only a few. Also known for developing the hip-step
style, or what some call jump up, Odi has a list of productions under his
belt, including ?Defying the Tribes? and ?Anthem?. Not looking to stop
anywhere soon, Odi is the cofounder of G-Force, which consists, among
others, of Reid Speed. This will be a set not to miss, as Odi is known not
only for his disgustingly sick mixes and proper chune selection, but also
scratching methods that leave many awestruck.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday at Abbasso

It would be more than $133. If you buy 19 drinks without ever tipping, good 
luck getting waited on.

I've had 16 Beam and Cokes before, plus 2 zipperheads, so its entirely 
possible.

I did fall down once while walking home though. My liver probably looks like 
Ted Kennedy's too.



While writing this, AIM blinged me the following: "How much do you drink?
The number of drinks matters. People who drank small amounts of alcohol on a 
regular basis had the smallest abdominal heights, while those who indulged 
in binge drinking of three or four drinks on one occasion had the highest 
measures."



3 or 4? HAH. Call me Betty.....Ford

Would be real nice, but I haven't heard most of the DnB dj's "push the
envelope" in years.  Especially not on a month-to-month basis.  If you
want to point out some sets for me to listen to, I'd love it; I'm just not
expecting anyone to show me dark/tech/hardstep DJs who have had much of a
progression since around 2000.

There's a reason club nights keep drawing less and less people, and I
think you've hit on part of it.

What will bring out twice as many people this week will wind up with half
as many people coming out six months from now.

The 'rave' scene used to have some innovative music; picking stuff that
sounds the same, every time, got ride of a lot of the people who would
*still* be coming out, to hear something new.

Dunno.

Have you listened to recent Tech Itch?  I've seen him and London
Elektricity lately; begging the promoter to bring back L.E., and avoiding
Tech Itch for at least the next few months.  One was very good; one was
very mediocre.

I'd make a cash money bet that a well done machine could be better than
95% of the DJ's out there; I'm unsure if it could catch more than that.

However, if you had one of those 5% picking the tunes for the machine, I'm
betting it could replace all but the very best.

Dunno.

--0-861872148-1064266671=:4191
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Welcome to the fourth ever EventNation.com Announcement email.  We don't put these out too often, but there have been some big changes at EventNation.com that you should know about.

In this email:
o  Site Upgrade Overview
o  Improved Feature: Event Watch
o  Enhanced Features for Promoters
o  New Website:  930913.COM


------------------------------
Site Upgrade Overview
------------------------------

EventNation.com has been up and running for almost 3 years now.  In that time we've added a lot of new features without removing any of the old ones.  The site was starting to suffer from feature-bloat, so we decided to do some housecleaning.  We removed a lot of the things that no one ever used and improved the features that most people do use, such as our Press Release Distribution and our Event Watch services.  We also reduced the number of categories available so that we can focus more on the ones that get used.  And lastly, we moved the discussions completely over to the EventNation.com Communities site, which has been totally remodeled as well.  More on all of this below.

------------------------------
Improved Feature: Event Watch
------------------------------

We get more positive feedback about our Event Watch option than any other feature on the site.  With this feature, we send you an email whenever a new event is added to a category of your choice.  We realize that some of you don't want to check our site every day (really!), so this feature lets you know when there are new events of interest to you.  We've made Event Watching easier, improved the format of the email that gets sent out, and removed the artificial limit on the number of watches a user can have.  Also, by reducing the number of categories on the site itself, we've made it easier to find the categories that you're interested in.

------------------------------
Enhanced Features for Promoters
------------------------------

We have some new and improved tools for the event promoters who use EventNation.com to spread the word about their events.   Now, when you've posted your event on our site, you will find a list of additional options.  These include one-step ticketing through Brown Paper Tickets, instant submission to 930913.COM, and best of all, our newly improved Press Release Distribution system.  With our Press Release Distribution system, your event listing is re-written in press release format and distributed to the various media outlets that are appropriate for your kind of event.  Currently, this feature is only available in a handful of states (CA, DC, OH, NY, and WA), but we'll be adding many more over the next few weeks.  You can use any of these options for free, so give them a try.

------------------------------
New Website:  930913.COM
------------------------------

EventNation.com Communities is now called 930913.COM.  The site has been completely re-written, is much easier to use, and offers a whole slew of new features.  Just like before, you can discuss any subject that pertains to your area, whether 'your area' is your state, your city, or your neighborhood.  Discussions are now easier to find, easier to start, and easier to join.  We also added free spam-filtered webmail.  Now you can have your own email account on 930913.COM.  And unlike a lot of the other 'free' webmail services, we won't pawn your email address to every spam company in the world.  In fact, we do our best to filter out all unsolicited email.  Plus, you can automatically forward email from your 930913.COM account to someplace else, if you'd like.  Try finding another webmail service that lets you do that.

If you have an account on EventNation.com (which you do if you're receiving this email), then you have an account on 930913.COM.  If you're a moderator on EventNation.com, you're a moderator on 930913.COM.  And if you're an editor on EventNation.com, then you're practically a god (or goddess) on 930913.COM.

And if you're one of those unlucky people whose accounts we were unable to transfer, send me an email at daustin@eventnation.com and I'll take care of you.

------------------------------
So that's all the news for now.   Go check out the newly improved sites at http://www.eventnation.com and http://www.930913.com.  Let us know if you have any comments, complaints, or compliments by emailing me at daustin@eventnation.com.  We love feedback.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hang the dj?

As much as a formula mixing can seem to be sometimes, it is still hard for 
me to put faith in an inanimate object that lacks the ability to create and 
think for itself.

...and who would want to?

I personally start to feel monotonous when I start mixing all the records in 
my set the same way. Its boring and predictable. Machines are taught 
formulas and procedures. They will become boring and predictable much faster 
than a human with eagerness to innovate and create.

Are these machines able to mix 3 or 4 records at once? (Probably better than 
I can right now, actually)

How about tag with a human DJ, and program intelligently on the fly?

...or put any thought into programming it's set at all? (I guess thats up to 
the lazy ass dude who programmed IT)

I'd like to see Robbie the Robot tweak EQ's and do funky table tricks with a 
darling brunette under his right arm, a bottle o' booze in his left hand, 
and a big breasted blonde under the decks expressing her knee-pad love.

Nothing pumps me up more than fun loving antics and the feel of good tunes.

Its funny how they want objects that possess no feeling try to express it.

What a horrible night to have a curse.
               - Simon Belmont

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hang the dj?


well you know that was a three year old article.  You can train software
to beatmatch, some rudimentary eqs etc, but you cant teach it to respond
to how the crowd is feeling it.  they talked about heat and motion snesors
but thats nonsense. for the best effect, you cant tailor a set 100% to a
crowd, and you can't slam a pre-planned set down their throats either..
theres something in between about giving the crowd what they want, and
taking them somewhere slightly to the side of that, and I don't think you
could ever train a machine to do that.

Subject: {pb-cle} Input @ Annabell's

We're heading into our last month of doing our Input show at Annabell's.  I 
first wanted to thank all the crews, dj's and promoters that helped us have 
so much success.  There's absolutely no way I could have ever come close to 
having such an enjoyable weekly without all of you.  I also have so much 
love for everyone who has come down to enjoy the night, you guys are really 
the ones that made it happen.
I hope I can get something else going in the future out in Akron but I 
really feel like its time to move on.  I think that our scene deserves a 
better spot than where we are now, we've represented and it's time that 
people need to recognize us.

I will hang on to the venue a little longer if there is reasonable interest 
from anyone wanting to play there before I shut down shop.  I would like to 
see some of the live PA, IDM, and dj's that haven't had a chance to play 
much get a chance to have some representation.  I will listen too everyone 
who's interested but only contact me if you are serious, I really want to 
focus on finding a new place by the end of winter.

contact me at either Matthew1074@AOL.com or Codered469@hotmail.com

Maybe if they discovered some way to tap their brain waves? Or just some
kind of device that could sense emotions based on facial features and
handgestures...Whats that thing that that fawker BT uses? They brushed up on
that mumbo jumbo in better living through the circuitry...

Maybe you can say it won't happen in the near future...but never say
never...

I will hang on to the venue a little longer if there is reasonable interest 
from anyone wanting to play there before I shut down shop. I would like to 
see some of the live PA, IDM, and dj's that haven't had a chance to play 
much get a chance to have some representation. I will listen too everyone

focus on finding a new place by the end of winter.

Yes, please come out to support this night.  Great promoters, great vibe.
Of course I'm biased cuz they booked us. But it's true! :)

Tomorrow you can expect to hear Jwan debut some tunes from Technoir
Audio's third release, "Chord Control" featuring Shawn Rudiman and Arne
Weinberg!

I'll be playing some drum n bass.  Say hi to us!

Subject: {pb-cle} Turbo and Ozone

Ahh, music sweet music.
I was in a pretty blah mood when I came into the building this morning.
Then I heard some random guy yell "gimme a break!" for whatever reason.
My internal soundtrack has improved a lot since then.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Input @ Annabell's

Yes thank you all very much.  I think I can count the days I've missed there 
on both hands.  It was a great run and I have had a lot of great memories 
from there.

Speaking to Turbo and Ozone... this is a track ID I've
wanted for a LOOOOOONG time. In the movie 'Breakin',
does anyone know name of the track Ozone dances with
the broom to??? I always loved that scene, esp. that
awesome old-skool jam he rocks out to. I heard someone
spin it out once, as the last track of thier set and I
thought that was like the greatest thing  ever. I
guess I could look it up myself but I'm lazy and
someone out there knows it... anyone???

Track ID please. Its a remake of "I Want Money" but the chorus is spoken 
slowly by a woman with a really thick accent. Maybe some sort of Eastern 
European accent. Who's the remake by please.

Who says it has to think for itself?

All it has to do is try something, and get feedback from it.  How you rank
that 'feedback' is the hard part; off the top, you could:

-Take vision recognition
	-are people looking at the DJ booth?
	-are they smiling?
-Take infrared:
	-how much body heat is on the dance floor, compared to room
temperature?
-Take pressure readings
	-what percentage of the attendance is on the dance floor?
	-how much are they moving?
-Take sound readings
	-filtering the main speakers, which is actually pretty easy, how
much noise are the people making?

Dunno.

Basically, get as much feedback from the room as you can.  Put it into a
ranking system.  Give the computer instructions on how to do something
very simple.  And tell it to improvise, based loosely on feedback.

If you can get that system down, after a year or two, I'd expect the
machine (with tuning from a top 5% DJ) to easy beat 95%+ of the DJ's out
there.

I don't think the machine can get to 100%, but I'd be suprised if it
couldn't come close, with enough work.

I'm thinking from Felix da Housecat's production album "Kittenz and the
Glitz".  Vocalist is Miss Kitten, track is Madame Hollywood?

If I'm right, the lyric "and maybe one day you can visit my condo on a big
hill you know, like 9-0-2-1-0" is in there somewhere.

That's actually a remake from 1979...

The Flying Lizards - Money (That's What I Want)

Available on NUMEROUS 80's new wave comps and also on the (now kinda hard to come by) second Wedding
Singer soundtrack.

Track ID please. Its a remake of "I Want Money" but the chorus is spoken
slowly by a woman with a really thick accent. Maybe some sort of Eastern
European accent. Who's the remake by please.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hang the dj?


I have to question your fundamental assertion that a computer able to
measure all these things would beat 95% of djs out there.  Is that ALL djs
including bedroom djs who can't beatmatch? or 95% of the best djs in the
world?

Right here you are talking about huge technological investments, that
basically amount to the feedback a human being could ascertain in a mere 1
second glance.

There is also the enigma factor.  The fact that a human being is making
decisions I'm sure affects the crowds in some way that can't be
duplicated.  Knowing that someone just picked an awesome track to follow
the one you're currently rocking out to has a very nice psychological
effect, I don't think the same kind of bond could develop between
dancefloor and computer.

so is the computer gonna go crate digging to find shit that people 
dont already know but that will kill a dancefloor? is it going to 
be able to juxtapose two tracks with humour like ive seen many 
deejays do?

i think that a computer could come close to approximating sets 
from pop music jukeboxes like the popular prog deejays, but a 
computer doesnt have soul and cant beat a deejay who plays with 
soul.

I'm pulling 95% out of my ass; let me cut down what I'm saying, if it's
all right:

An automated system with a large (but reasonable) amount of development
and a skilled DJ picking it's 'record library' can get more people dancing
than 9 out of 10 DJs.  Define 'DJ' as everyone who plays in front of an
audience.

A human being who's good at it, and who cares, yes.  :)  There's a time
and place to everything, and things like 'ego' are never going to step in
the way of a computer.  The right track at the right time (and the right
set at the right time!)

That's one of the reasons why I'm saying a computer can never beat the
best DJ's.  :)

It's really not that hard to get them to dance by playing dance music.

Giving them an "unforgettable" experience is the hard part and we've
agreed that it will be next to impossible to have a machine do that better
than a human.

Most DJs who aren't your average ambitious and real young rave DJ, I have
to give more credit to than you are as to knowing what they're doing.  I'd
say anyone who plays in these major clubs where a computer might be
tested, probably is there because week in and week out they have a good
selection and know how to move a crowd.

I definitely think a computer that doesn't trainwreck on the other
hand would definitely do a lot better at keeping people dancing than 95%
of newcomer rave djs!!

People do stupid shit on all kinds of drugs. You just don't hear about the 
good trips. Blaming this stuff is like blaming GTA3 for the fact that those 
kids shot two people.

These are just tools to let people get in touch with their inner "stupid

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hang the dj?

<<I definitely think a computer that doesn't trainwreck on the other hand would definitely do a lot
better at keeping people dancing than 95% of newcomer rave djs!!>>

Which further proves my point: the only reason this is a valid discussion (aside from the intrigue
of the man vs. machine, Kasparov vs. Deep Blue style sci-fi story feel) is because...a good
percentage of what is passing as a "deejay" these days is someone simply layering record after
record with little experience in the crowd-pleasing, wowing-them department...therefore, most
inexperienced, non-committal clubgoers may not know the difference.

I could totally see something like this happening at a place like Pleasure Island in
Florida...somwhere where a large, consistently overturning population of transients and vacationers
would congregate to "party".

Or perhaps somewhere like Donzi's or Tequilla Willies here in Pittsurgh where the focus isn't so
much on the music/deejay as it is the meat-market, binge-drinking nitelife aspect.

yeah i didnt even look at it like that, but that is a really sad
indicator of what dance music is about these days. 

>(i like the way you spell out the word "deejay", tom. it's a

yeah, something about the "DJ" spelling looks so cheesy especially
since the addition of "superstar" or whatever other bullshit
people put next to those 2 letters to sell magazines or mix cd's.
most people DJ, i deejay. too bad for them.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hang the dj?

I've always liked it, but I don't understand what makes it a throwback.

D.J. is an abbreviation for Disc Jockey, plain and simple right?

Same way that M.C. is short for Master of Ceremonies. Even though its often 
spelled emcee.

Am I off the [mark] here?

<<i think that a computer could come close to approximating sets from pop 
music jukeboxes like the
popular prog deejays, but a
computer doesnt have soul and cant beat a deejay who plays with soul.>>

to take that a step further, the fact that this debate continues is 
sufficient testament to the fact
that a large percentage of deejays lack the talent or inventiveness to 
distinguish themselves from a
computer layering tracks in a similar fashion.

(i like the way you spell out the word "deejay", tom. it's a throwback to 
older days...)

looking at m-w.com deejay dates to 1949, DJ to 1950. but as i
pointed out it seems like nowadays "DJ Culture" and "Superstar DJ"
etc etc is all you see. no one uses deejay anymore.

i always spell it emcee.

If your thinking of a trumpet vine, its not the same. Of course I don?t
think u are because trumpet vines are not really found in ohio. My mom stole
some on the way back from vacation in florida a few years back and its been
growing every year in our yard since.

Yes im kewl.

You'll have to understand Pangea...

Tom is more old school than Grandfather Time and more real than McCoy.

Hes not going to use some pussy acronym or abbreviation, however accurate or 
logical it may be.

Its what keeps him alive in the cut-throat streets of the PGH (thats 
Pittsburgh for you white folks)

if youre saying it doesnt make sense because you assume deejay was
derived from DJ which was derived from disc jockey, then obviously
(at least if merriam webster is to be believed, and i dont have a
copy of the OED to look in there) thats not how the terms came to be.

thats right. and being only 23 (for 2 more days!) its difficult
being this old school while being this young. i just rule. 

>Hes not going to use some pussy acronym or abbreviation, however
accurate or

thats right goddamnit.

i did sprain the shit out of my ankle on sunday playing basketball
in mellon park with goose ratana and jwan though.......

"deejay" was probably slang for a while and it probably appeared in print
as "deejay" first that way .. which is how words come to end up in the
dictionary.

Before anyone calls him a pussy, this happened because he dunked on some
dude, knocking him down in the process, and his foot happened to land on
the guys head at an awkward angle.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: BSP (kinda)  domain web hosting

OK, I have my website hosted at dreamhost.  Well I just happened to 
look at their website and noticed a really nice deal.  1600 mb of 
storage, 15 domains, anonymous ftp, etc that's originally like 70 bux 
a month is $10 on 22, 23, and 24.  Only lame thing is it's only for 
new customers, so I figure the least I could do is tell people on 
here plus I get a small referral bonus for everyone I refer.  Use the 
following URL:

http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?vrillusions

>From the main page, the promotion is in the upper left "box"  you can 
go there for all the details.  I think they'll register the first 
domain for you as well for that price if I remember correctly.  You 
only have till tommorrow, the 24th to do this, so if your looking for 
a web host, this is a reallllly good deal, plus I haven't had any big 
issues with them.  Just please use that address I have above, I 
basically get like $1 for each person I refer, pretty lame I know, 
but at least it helps pay for it and it doesn't change anything on 
your account, so it's a win- semi-win situation (would rather be able 
to actually get the promotion, damn them).

btw, sorry if this sounds too spammish, typing this up rather quickly 
so don't have time to make it sound less spammy :)

70/month is real weak unless that's a dedicated box.  You can prob find 
better deals everyday @ cihost.com!

No, that's what it WAS.  The $70/month plan is now only $10.  Yeah I 
know $70 isn't a great price for it, but $10 sure is :)

I've looked at dedicated hosting and seems like they are around $100  
Been thinking of getting that and selling web space on it to pay for 
it.

We have been having some issues with the station.  I believe last night 
might have only been broadcast on KSU TV.  I will try to have it resolved by 
next week.

Great time at the Sidetrakkt event Saturday. The music
was phenomonal. Onnomon is one of the best live acts
I have seen. Psyphon tore it up! That was a great warm
up set. I wasn't that impressed with Jirah. The music was
good, but there wasn't much mixing going on. He was
just playing files from his laptop. Electric Mayhem and
Sweet Chaos dope as ever!

Peace,

Friday, November 21, 2003 Cleveland, OH


Goahead productions presents the first in a series of small
intimate events with big music. 

Artists:

Mind bending psytrance sets from our friends from Asheville

Kri  Touchsamadhi  Asheville, N.C 
http://www.touchsamadhi.com/kri.asp

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE
Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred 
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each other. 
These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we danced all 
night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower ourselves as one 
tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the power of these sites was 
released into our bodies, giving us strength and connecting us to Gaia. Then 
the religions of fear took hold. They destroyed our sacred sites and our 
rituals, burning all who dared to question. But the power could not be 
suppressed forever and the great cycles of time have brought us full circle to 
this new moment and we gather once again. The ancient memory has been 
reawakened, the all night dance ritual has returned. We are once again 
experiencing the mystical power of the Trance.

tell them to take down streetsboro's too and play it there :)  or if

Hey gang....

1) Big thanks to VR for this tip. Transferred my father-in-law's business site to these guys. Looks
like it's gonna be PIMP.

2) Really, why wouldn't you do this? How much are you paying now per month?? This is $10 for more
storage space than you can use in a year!!!

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: BSP (kinda) domain web hosting


OK, I have my website hosted at dreamhost.  Well I just happened to
look at their website and noticed a really nice deal.  1600 mb of
storage, 15 domains, anonymous ftp, etc that's originally like 70 bux
a month is $10 on 22, 23, and 24.  Only lame thing is it's only for
new customers, so I figure the least I could do is tell people on
here plus I get a small referral bonus for everyone I refer.  Use the
following URL:

http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?vrillusions

>>From the main page, the promotion is in the upper left "box"  you can
go there for all the details.  I think they'll register the first
domain for you as well for that price if I remember correctly.  You
only have till tommorrow, the 24th to do this, so if your looking for
a web host, this is a reallllly good deal, plus I haven't had any big
issues with them.  Just please use that address I have above, I
basically get like $1 for each person I refer, pretty lame I know,
but at least it helps pay for it and it doesn't change anything on
your account, so it's a win- semi-win situation (would rather be able
to actually get the promotion, damn them).

btw, sorry if this sounds too spammish, typing this up rather quickly
so don't have time to make it sound less spammy :)

so my andythepooh account keeps getting fake emails from Microsoft stating i need to update software or something right. but there are file attachments with these emails (.exe) and i wont download them. Also i keep getting emails saying this such and such addresse didnt go through. Like I emailed someone and the email addy was no longer available...
 
right now i cant do a search on any search engine, and it keeps telling me i need to download spy ware.
 
i have no clue whats going on, and was asking if someone could help possibly??...

My current plan with them is 9.95, but it's the cheap one with 200mb of
space and only 1 domain.  I'm still waiting for the sucks to be you
message because I still tried to sign up for the other one :)

Well, first off don't ever download those attachments, just delete them,
set em on fire and then stomp on them a few times :)

Go to http://www.download.com/ and search for ad aware and start scanning.
 Also updating your anti-virus software if you have it and running that
wouldn't hurt either.

this is the swen worm, not spyware.
http://www.technewsworld.com/perl/story/31632.html
just run some antivirus software. i've always used norton systemworks, 
but am now playing around with the free one at www.grisoft.com
anyhow, as long as your windows and internet explorer is patched 
current, just delete the emails.....

spyware is a different beast.  best example, you install kazaa (not 
kazaa lite) and the installer program installs kazaa and some other 
programs.  they cause popups and other fun crap, and in some cases crash 
your PC
for these, get spybot S&D to remove them.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: spy ware

ad-aware has been of questionable value.   i know at one point they went 
4 months without a database update.  then they had removed some spyware 
incorrectly and it toasted your winsock (read: networking ability)

spybot S&D is what i hear recommended more often, and what i use.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: spy ware

Doah!  That sucks man.  My friends that work tech support get those too.  
They have fun with them whilst keeping their jobs, its a skill they picked 
up.  LOL..but yeah, I just use ad-aware to stop the spyware?  That works I 
guess.

When it comes to spyware, I just say like kramer did on seinfeld, if you see 
what you like, ENJOY the show...

that episode with the reverse peephole..

good stuff..

Sorry, its been a long day.

See, I wouldn't be stupid enough to try it myself.  However, it does sound like a good way to get back at the next asshole that cheats on me.  Invite him for tea. ;)  *insert evil laugh here mwhahahahaha*

They even add in the description of the flower, "All parts of these
plants are poisonous if eaten."

What I think is funny, is that after reading that article about the dude
chopping off his junk, someone will get curious about the flower and
make some of their own tea.

--0-2129424471-1064464388=:98254
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

So since I've moved here to Pittsburgh I've witnessed nothing but hell.
 
The number one reason being this company I was working for "Advantage Wireless", they haven't payed me a penny since I moved here. Two of my roomates aren't seeing any cash as well. Pretty much that means that the rents been past due, and it's getting out of hand.They owe me and my roomates close to 1,800 each. I have a new job now that holds its own, yet I'm moving out of this house. There are other reasons why to the fact but I'll hold that top secret for a little while...
 
Anyways, if anyone that knows me is interested in getting a place (id like to stay on the Mt) Id be happy to look further into getting a new roomate. I really need to get into a comfortable setting because right now, I'm driving myself crazy.
 
I'd move back to Cleveland, but it's way to early for that.  Not to mention the job offering I have right now. I cant pass it up.
 
I'm running a fever right now or else Id go into great detail...
 
Email me for more info if possible....

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE

Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each
other.  These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we
danced all night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower
ourselves as one tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the
power of these sites was released into our bodies, giving us strength and
connecting us to Gaia.  Then the religions of fear took hold. They
destroyed our sacred sites and our rituals, burning all who dared to
question. But the power could not be suppressed forever and the great
cycles of time have brought us full circle to this new moment and we
gather once again. The ancient memory has been reawakened, the all night
dance ritual has returned. We are once again experiencing the mystical
power of the Trance.

Subject: {pb-cle} anyone recognize this old sample? - "Let us pray..."

I believe this is off an LP from the early 90s by an unknown artist.  Not sure if it was released in UK or US.  Style is epic/hard trance which was very well produced, incredible music.  Had a copy of these songs on a tape which I think was dubbed off a CD, which has been lost.   In this particular song,it does a build, drops to silence, "let us pray" sample/vocal, then goes into epic trance mayhem.  A special prize to anyone with this on disk!  Act now!  Operators are standing by...

Maybe I am just naive, but I think getting my "winsock toasted" sounds like 
a very comfortable proposition.

ad-aware has been of questionable value.   i know at one point they went 4 
months without a database update.  then they had removed some spyware 
incorrectly and it toasted your winsock (read: networking ability)

spybot S&D is what i hear recommended more often, and what i use.

Subject: {pb-cle} Annabelles Last Night - thanks


Thanks to everyone who came out to Annabelles (if youre on the list) and
to Matthew for being a great host.  Man we had so much fun it was
ridiculous. I don't think I've smiled that much in a long time.  The crowd
there is so great, they are willing to dance no matter what kind of music
is playing.   You have a good thing going on, I hope it continues in
whatever next place it goes to.

No kissing will be required, TNA 003 will be released very shortly

Annabelles was off the hook last night, thanks again to everyone 
who came out. Last night was well worth 30 min we were lost trying 
to get on an exit that was not marked, and closed. Damn you

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP: Hypnotyza @ Matrix tonight....

Hey gang...

through some odd dealings and other such weirdness, i'll be "guest" deejaying at Exit @ Matrix
tonight, spinning house (both progressive and, if they can handle it, some funkier and more tribal
stuff).

as of right now this is a one-off thing, but i'm really trying to work with some friends of mine and
the manager to get a regular night going down there. (perhaps a weekend?? who knows...)

for any of y'all who aren't into havana or can't make it down there, please stop by and check me
out. i'll be tagging a bit and doing a solo set probably around 11 or 12.

No kissing will be required, TNA 003 will be released very shortly
and will be available at record stores all over the world.

Annabelles was off the hook last night, thanks again to everyone
who came out. Last night was well worth 30 min we were lost trying
to get on an exit that was not marked, and closed. Damn you
mapquest! Tonight we'll be in Erie, so if your in the area buy me

is that all that suprising? i know tarantino has his haters, but
every one of his films is fantastic. most of the stuff he's been
involved with has been fantastic. the dialogue in his movies is so
real yet so nearly poetic that even i, the guy with no memory,
memorizes lines of dialogue from his shit. the guy is a genius. i
still havent seen robert rodriguez's "once upon a time in mexico"
yet, but i really need to. desperado and from dusk till dawn are
on that same level as the tarantino flicks.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: spy ware

Not to get off the usual donkey punch and penis topics, but what she had was
ehh, some virus I can't remember the name of now. Err, it was
Trojan.ByteVerify.

Anyway, if anyone gets this trojan (I trust someone will make a condom
reference), you'll need antivirus software to clean it up. Clear your dns
cache (by reboot or through ipconfig), empty your temporary files, and check
to make sure your browser hasn't been comprimised through this thing:

http://www.spychecker.com/program/cwshredder.html

SpybotSD and Ad-Aware haven't been updated for whatever the hell it did to
her browser, but that thing works well. Yes, you'll still need AV software.

NAI has a neat little cleanup tool for the latest 30 hardcore worms/viruses
called stinger (http://vil.nai.com/vil/stinger/) that is a freebie if y'all
don't feel like shellin out cash for McAfee. And, as always, Trend Micro has
their free housecall tool (http://housecall.trendmicro.com/) that works
well, and you never really have to update.

Nrrd Power,

Mike

i saw once upon a time in mexico and was really disappointed.  the movie
had its moments, usually when johnny depp's character was involved.  not
enough guns, too much seivte t illuminati plotline bullshit, no
character development, not enough guns, and not enough guns.  i loved
from duck til dawn, el mariachi, and desperado too.

is that all that suprising? i know tarantino has his haters, but every
one of his films is fantastic. most of the stuff he's been involved with
has been fantastic. the dialogue in his movies is so real yet so nearly
poetic that even i, the guy with no memory, memorizes lines of dialogue
from his shit. the guy is a genius. i still havent seen robert
rodriguez's "once upon a time in mexico" yet, but i really need to.
desperado and from dusk till dawn are on that same level as the
tarantino flicks.

Those of you who know me know how I've longed to move back home to NYC, and 
so go I.

I want to thank all of you for many years of good times and damn good 
near-midwest celebration.  I've enjoyed being a part of this area's scene 
for over a decade and will continue to make my presence felt in times to 
come.

There is much love from me to you.

So...in order to go out properly, a couple of us over a n space have cooked 
up an ad hoc party -->

Ian Mariano and Matthew Vella cordially invite you and yours to a raucous 
excersize of frivolity in honor of their move to NYC.

Featuring the personality stylings of Amy and her merry-making crew:
   Ian Mariano  n space / nyc
   Daniel McLeod   n space / cleveland
   Bonita (dlp)   w.a.r. / cleveland

Plus once upon a time in mexico had enrique iglesias
in it for crying out loud.  Every scene he was in i
wanted to either throw things at the screen or vomit. 
I also wholeheartedly agree that there were not enough
guns.  In retrospect once upon a time came off as
being too polished as compared to desparado and
particularly el mariachi...too much slick production
and not enough guns...

That's what you get from someone who's last three movies have been the "Spy Kids" series for Disney.
As much as I don't want to think it, he may have been assimilated by the "crank 'em out" hollywood
machine.

Granted, as family movies go, the Spy Kids flicks are pretty decent...there's not a whole lot of
pandering to the younger audience. But it may have hampered his ability to get back to his roots and
make a dirty, gritty, big bang flick.

+50 STP's.

I'm positive "Kill Bill Vol. 1" kicks all kinds of ass 7 ways to Sunday, but....

I feel kinda weird about that review. It was almost TOO glowing....borderline ass-kissing, even.

However, I am of the staunch opinion that Tarantino, with only 4 films under his belt as a director,
is a classic visionary on the level of Kubrick, and will go down in film history as such.

Forgive me if I'm wary of really early reviews like this that don't have anything of substance yet
manage to give a reacharound to the filmmaker...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hooj Choons RIP.


That sucks.  I have heard a whole lot of hooj choons releases and everyone 
one has been just as great.  I really don't think I have heard anything from 
that label that I haven't liked.  From people who have been committed to 
buying their releases to just casual listeners, pretty much everyone has a 
fav hooj choons label track.

So is the dance music industry that bad right now?

I wonder how some labels are getting releases out....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hooj Choons RIP.

Well, the economic state of music distribution in general is, shall we say, 
not so hot -- and a lot of independent labels (mine included) are getting 
lost in the muck, especially after the last WMC.  It's not just in the US, 
either. Only those with the cash -- cash, not credit -- behind them seem to 
be keeping afloat.  Some distributors, not all, are taking care of their 
debt first, the labels second...so receipts on sales to distributors aren't 
coming in.  Hopefully this situation will improve.

and a ton of djs who used to feed the industry thru purchasing vinyl are
"making music" instead of buying records.  i wonder how they expect labels
and record stores to be there to sell their future hits if everyone is
producing instead of buying records.

i think the idea is to give yourself a conpetitive advantage when
deejaying. if youre the only person who has the tunes and people
like them, youll get booked. and even for some of the more popular
labels, im sure the deejays running them are making way more off
of spinning records than they are from profits on vinyl sales.

Well, Tarantino's stories go beyond his four movies....

"Natural Born Killers' and 'True Romance' as an example were both based on 
stories written by Tarantino. He knows how to fuck it up...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hooj Choons RIP/Industry trends

Good point.

A lot of them are also playing/trading mp3.  The thing is.... most of the
pros that I know go out and buy the vinyl afterwards.  The rest get taken
out of the loop.  For now.   That's going to end up backfiring if it already
hasn't -- because there are way more takers than givers out there.  That's
mainstream america's BIGGEST problem -- they don't get the product out there
soon enough.  In this day and age, if you want to sell your record you will
get it from producer to vinyl ASAP.  Point in case = the latest crystal
waters track.  It was promo'd to all the record pools 3-4 months before it
was available to purchase.  Any dj playing that kind of stuff was forced to
download it if they wanted to stay on top... thusly perpetuating the vicious
cycle.

The uk is just as much at fault.  They promo stuff up to a year before it is
released.... if they want to make money they will learn.  I really think
people don't realize how deeply it affects us when djs and listeners don't
buy their music.  If a dj isn't supporting the artists, how can we expect
the customers to do the same?    It takes money to keep things moving and
its a vicious cycle.  To survive you must support it, not take from it.  In
the eyes of many a "smart" dj is one who is also a producer and has the
business model of a rock band, eh?  I don't really think thats what this is
all about.  While not everyone is looking to be a rockstar, plenty are.
Progressive/Alternative/Underground is a way of excaping people who only
serve their own egos --- not feeding those type of people.  If we are to
keep our identity and thus our strength, people really need to think hard
and work on it.  Right now things are still moving - but at a snail's
ace  - and we won't move forward until more people look at the bigger
picture.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hooj Choons RIP/Industry trends

big long response. sorry to those uninterested.

kelly sez:
<<and a ton of djs who used to feed the industry thru purchasing vinyl are "making music" instead of
buying records.  i wonder how they expect labels and record stores to be there to sell their future
hits if everyone is producing instead of buying records.>>

well, i don't think anyone's doing it maliciously..."I'll fix that Kelly and her damn high prices
for vinyl! I'll make my OWN music! BWAHAHAHA!"

i pursue the creation of music because at certain times, i want to say something with my own music,
not someone else's. i don't see that there's any harm in that. i'm certainly not doing it because i
hate all the music that's out there now. it's a personal choice.

on the other hand, i don't necessarily intend on selling records. at least not at this point. if the
offer comes along, maybe. so there are definitely two sides to the coin.

but even still, that pursuit hasn't stopped me from patronizing your establishment.


Doug sez:
<<if you want to sell your record you will get it from producer to vinyl ASAP.....was promo'd to all
the record pools 3-4 months before it was available to purchase.  Any dj playing that kind of stuff
was forced to download it if they wanted to stay on top... >>

True, Doug, but what if the song tanks in the promo stage?? If deejays say "hey, i dropped this and
people vomitted on the dancefloor and said it sounded like emu fucking", and the track has already
gone to press for, say, 8 to 10 thousand copies... then not only is the artist in big trouble from a
reputation standpoint with the deejaying public, but both the artist and the label are ridiculously
fucked financially. The label won't make its investment back, they certainly won't be in any hurry
to support the artist further, and if this happens on even a semi-regular basis, the label won't be
around long enough to give other artists a shot.

I'm sure you know that it takes time to press up the vinyl and get it distributed. Especially for
smaller labels like Hooj and those that our type of people frequent.

That's why record labels are wrong to NOT embrace the amazing distrobution possibilities that the
Internet presents. And they're seeing the results of their hesitance to adapt. And this goes just as
much for the indie labels as the majors.

Look at Hooj's page...what's the only thing that remained successful? Marketing records via the
internet in a subscription format that rewarded customers for regular purchase and gave them access
to more music with less hassle.

<<They promo stuff up to a year before it is released.... >>

If you're talking about when a label promos a track a year before release, then yeah, that's just
dumb. It enforces and further enhances a class-structure within the deejay community that's just
silly.

On the other hand, if it's the artist handing out copies of the record/cd/midi file to friends and
associates before he/she delivers it to the label, that's totally different.

<<In the eyes of many a "smart" dj is one who is also a producer and has the business model of a
rock band, eh?  I don't really think thats what this is all about.  While not everyone is looking to
be a rockstar, plenty are.>>

That's just silly logic. The people I know who produce music of all types are also the group MOST
likely to spend money on music because they eat, sleep, breathe, sneeze and shit MUSIC in every
aspect of their lives. They're the ones most dedicated to music in all its various forms.

You show me any performing artist (rockstar, dj, electronic producer, etc.) and I will show you
someone who has a decent size chunk of space in their house dedicated to housing their music
collection.

<<Progressive/Alternative/Underground is a way of excaping people who only serve their own egos --- 
not feeding those type of people.>>

There are just as many people in the "underground" who are self serving as there are in the
mainstream from a percentage standpoint.

>i pursue the creation of music because at certain times, i want
to say something with my own music,
>not someone else's. i don't see that there's any harm in that. 

i was just talking about this yesterday with the man like the MVP.
it seems like half the goons out there trying to make records are
just trying to make records that sound "passable" in their sets,
tunes that dont actually do anything except copy already familiar
ideas. i think thats a pretty poor reason to want to make tracks.
if youre not saying something that is inseparably you, you
probably shouldnt be fucking around. 

>i'm certainly not doing it because i
>hate all the music that's out there now. it's a personal choice.

and i actually realised this yesterday as well. i do hate almost
all the music out there. like 99.9%, including within the genres
that i do like. i was reading the new XLR8R yesterday, and they
discussed i think like one record in the whole magazine that i was
at all interested in hearing. its really pretty sad. but then i
went to milk and picked up 6 really hot records, 5 of which were
made in detroit and i remembered why i love those guys so much.
and im going to pick up theo parrish's ugly edits 5 today @ 720
which is also the hot shit. 

>on the other hand, i don't necessarily intend on selling records.
at least not at this point. if the
>offer comes along, maybe. so there are definitely two sides to
the coin.

even some jokers can sell 500 copies of average records. if youre
not trying to make a million bucks, i imagine with relatively
small pressings and help from established people you know and are
friends with, someone with decent tunes can not lose their ass
pressing up some records. 

>True, Doug, but what if the song tanks in the promo stage?? If
deejays say "hey, i dropped this and

id buy any track that sounds like emu fucking.

whats funny though is when youre talking about a tune that is
absolutely massive from the moment its first heard. do you really
need to keep that on promo for another 4 months? why? it just
makes no competitive sense. 

>I'm sure you know that it takes time to press up the vinyl and
get it distributed. Especially for
>smaller labels like Hooj and those that our type of people frequent.

it doesnt take THAT long. honestly, a month maybe, but lots of
things get promo'ed for way longer than that. 

>On the other hand, if it's the artist handing out copies of the
record/cd/midi file to friends and
>associates before he/she delivers it to the label, that's totally
different.

that is a different story. but i would look at someone funny if
they handed me a disc with  a midi file of their track on it. i
might even laugh.

that plus i dont think that relying on the band's model means you
need to become a "star". plenty of people make their money from
touring and playing live, both in deejaying and bands. im telling
you not many of them make cash from record profits.

that isnt always true though. i know some people who are way into
their instruments who listen to not much music at all. but theyre
toolboxes so i dont know if they count.

I agree with you, but the record I was talking about was OBVIOUSLY going to
be a huge hit and will probably make it to radio.  American promos in
mainstream dance almost always go to the wrong people.  Half the time their
dumb asses promo a dance track to hip-hop djs.  The djs who would have
bought it had to download it AND so did the customers who were hearing in a
club.  They were proming it to people who have no concept of integrity and
are the first to fileshare because it is way of making themselves popular on
something besides talent.

I don't know... the ones who never "got it" may be seeing sucess trough
internet distribution - but ones who have a strong and smart business model
have success too.   Hooj promo'd their stuff to death (and to the wrong
people) and they are gone.  Subliminal and OM still stand strong in the us -
and their promos are RARE as fuck and only the cream de la cream get the
mp3s.

Maybe you quoted the wrong part - I'm having a hard time seeing anything
silly about that quote.  For what you said, though, for anyone who is
already successful that is probably true.  The majority haven't bought music
since they discoverd kazaa.  I can name 3-5 local djs who play every
weekend, make money off this music, who have not purchased music in YEARS
AND SELL the copies of their bootlegged and pirated material to their
customers (the ones they are supposed to be encouraging to buy music).
FUCK THAT AND THE  EXCUSES OF YOU STUPID PEOPLE WHO ENABLE THOSE
MUTHERFUCKERS.   Anyone who trys to justify that has got a problem.

Yeah, well they shouldn't be.  That's my point.

I don't agree 100%. I think it's a good place to start. It's a finite, comparable way to guage the
learning process. Not everyone comes out of the womb gifted and inspired enough to create their own
sound. Jimi Hendrix started out by playing RnB. P-Funk started in the late 50's as George Clinton's
doo-wop group called The Parliaments.

It's where you go, not where you start. The important thing is the progression.

<<i do hate almost all the music out there. like 99.9%, including within the genres that i do

you're infinitely pickier than i, but that's why you're tom cox and i'm mark cracka ass cracka who
occasionally spins good shit and progressive-sellout stuff too.

<<even some jokers can sell 500 copies of average records.

i'll sell something when i feel i create something original and/or good enough to sell. by my own
estimation.

and even then, i won't do it full time. music is my love, my hobby, and sometimes my escape from the
problems of the world. as soon as it becomes my "job", it loses some of the magic. i've learned that
lesson a little through deejaying. (though it hasn't stopped me.) i can only imagine what being a
professional music artist could be like.

<<id buy any track that sounds like emu fucking. >>

okay. you're not as picky as i thought...fah-reak.

<<plenty of people make their money from touring and
playing live, both in deejaying and bands. im telling

correct.

but in a strange yet logical way, one of the best ways to get recognized the world over and garner
more bookings is by getting a record into shops.

<<i know some people who are way into their instruments who listen to not much music at all. but
theyre toolboxes so i dont know if they count.>>

lol. i think if you're not learning from what's already been done and what's around you, you're
destined to repeat it. probably with less success.

Hmm. Check the Ableton website for artist loops from people like
Arovane, Chicks on Speed, Funkstorung, Future Loop Foundation, Heiko
Laux, and Modeselektor. Highfish has a really good interview on there
too.

What :I'm: talking about is something new. If you sold loop packs,
everyone gets their way. Unfortunately, there's not really a market for
it now. And as far as piracy goes, the loops are pretty useless in
themselves, it's the performance that would get licensed. 

Just a totally random thought.

I hear ya..my crew still gets with the vinyl though. 
We just got a new batch this week. 
I'll take an onnomon live performance any day of the
week though. 

Heh..that site has an even bigger CD selection. Fuckit.
bring those on too. 

I'll tell ya what is real played though. People standin
behind a laptop pushin a button every now and then.
I don't care how dope the music is..get that shit outta
here! I want to see some mixin and workin it, no runnin
one file into another! You might as well drop a cd
in and let that bitch play and come out on the dancefloor
and kick it with the peeps. I need synergy.

Oh, but you have to have a laptop to get all the freshest and dope tracks.
You don't look cool unless you have one. (At least in the mind of a

It's no different than people who think you're not a real deejay if you don't use ONLY two
turntables and a mixer.

Prejudices exist on both sides of every fence.

Oh, but you have to have a laptop to get all the freshest and dope tracks.
You don't look cool unless you have one. (At least in the mind of a
brainless idiot).  Ugh, I'm starting to get irritated when I think about all

yeah but IMO if your only motivation is to make middle of the road
crap, i think youre starting on the whole wrong foot. thats all.
working towards a greater goal doesnt mean you have to start with
LCD tunes.

thats the thing, its all about doing something to satisfy yourself
instead of living up to some ideal of what a song should sound like.

yeah i wouldnt want it to be my job either.

this is my point: getting your stuff out there is whats going to
help you in the long run but not by directly making profit from
selling it in stores. it might not lead to you lining your
pockets, but its a necessary step.

amen, and believe me the one guy im thinking of in particular
hasnt learned from whats come before.......

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mung

Sigfried and Roy are a hoot. They're in their mid 60's and are signed on to
play at the mirage till they die. Well, maybe not that long, but for another
10 years I beleive.

Out of curiosity, I went to their site, and it's just as funny, although not
intentionally:

http://www.siegfriedandroy.com/biography/timeline.php

Great captions like.. "Roy's life saved by his beloved pet Hexe" and "Roy
begins to frequent Bremen Zoo, befriends Chico the cheetah."

I guess he really befriended the cheetah, they left together to work on a
cruise ship, where they met Sigfried, etc. It's a really wild ride. By far
the funniest thing about these two is their Vegas mansion. It's a whole Las
Vegas sized city block, and has a big S&R on the guilded gate. I'd so love
to get really drunk and hang out with these guys for a day. Wait, I didn't
realize they had their own Saturday morning cartoon, I guess that tops it.

The last thing on the timeline is they were awarded "Magicians of the
Century" by some unknown entity. If anyone wants to see what real magicians
are all about, hit me up, I'll send some videos or something. Lance Burton
makes these guys look like chumps.

I'll probably be levitating things and making girls think I'm creepy at the
red zone tonight, can't wait to see everyone.

Tsk Tsk Tsk. You needed to start tonight, as the fruit really needs to soak
overnight.

Buffalo recipies vary a bit, mostly on the issue of Everclear. Generally
(courtest webtender.com):

1 fifth Gin
1 fifth 151 proof rum
1 fifth Gold tequila
1 fifth Vodka
1 fifth Tennessee whiskey
Selection Fruit
2 cans Fruit punch
Ice cubes

And let sit overnight....

As a quicker setting fruity alternative, try sangria -- it's perfect sangria
weather.

If you're just looking for tasty fuck-me-up, try Duvel if you can find it.
It's a belgian beer that tastes like kool aid, but comes in at a hefty 8.5%.
It tastes nothing of beer, but lots of pear and apple flavor. A little
pricey, but probably cheaper than all that liquor.

- mike

ps. don't pour Duvel faster than you could squeeze the liquid out of an eye
dropper.

ok, i normally wouldn't throw some politics on here but i got a kick out
of this:

http://adn.com/front/story/4019505p-4040652c.html

my favorite quote: 'That means doctors, lawyers and other self-employed
professionals can buy a $75,000 Hummer H2, for example, and write off
the purchase price as a business expense.'

i've become so used to the government fucking me that i just laugh when
i see things like this.  is that bad?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} wow.

Shit has been like that forever. Its called a company car.

Its no different than paying $75,000, directly against the company's gross 
sales, for a kickass suite in a posh downtown location.

Fringe benefits of owning your own business.

If you make money from DJing, and are straight up about paying taxes, you 
can write off the cost of vinyl, tables, mixers, and a vehicle to get you to 
and from gigs. After that's all said and done, you can probably get your net 
income down to $0 or close to it. You won't have to pay any taxes in that 
case. That's right, the government won't get any federal or state income tax 
from you.

Take advantage of your privelege as a pawn of the American capitalist 
system. You just have to be thorough about keeping receipts, and you'll have 
to file a schedule C attached to a full size 1040 tax form.

It doesn't even have to be your main source of income. I work for a company 
that pays me pretty well. I also do work on the side, and therefore can 
write off Internet access, cellphone expenses, computer equipment, and more.

These are your rights, use em or lose em.

fun, but I wasn't surprised Goldie made the first half his set sound like
ass, it was clipping so bad it with distortion. Only after me and Matt came
back from Tititon did it sound better, and quieter! BAILEY rocked that shit
bad, disgustingly bad! Also Essex? Or whoever was on b4 that? Mad props Aus

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} We are not evil

I don't get it actually. It's a net-label I guess, direct to people. Is
their overhead really 50%? That still sounds like evil to me. Kinda stupid
on the artist's part too, since they can do much better on say, mp3.com or
emusic.com. Vivendi is evil, but they'll give you a better cut.

It's all one guy's opinion, and frankly a lot of this music sucks. I've gone
through quite a bit of it so far, and none of it is really remarkable. Then
again, half the wax I buy these days sucks too. There's so much substandard
music on the market that this actually seems like a good idea, but there are
better implimentations, take kikapu for example.

If you can afford the legal fees, as an artist, you'd probably be better off
rolling something like this on your own with your friends.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} We are not evil

net labels is where its going.  I would much rather make a purchase like
this.  Maybe not this label exactly but here is another one.

http://www.thinnerism.com/main.php

I've downloaded some stuff from the above link and liked it.  Peoples tastes
in electronica fall into such deep little pockets, some people will think
this is the greatest thing since the shiny yellow button on the pioneer
mixers others will hate on it ala tom cox.

Subject: {pb-cle} Tiesto in Cbus 

I know its been mentioned, but Tiesto will be coming to the red zone on the
23rd of OCTO... Might consider going to this for various reasons, none of
which having to do with the enjoyment of losing 20 dollars (presales only!)
to listen to some semiexpertly mixed trance... Ed, where you stand on this
one? You saving your energy soley for Armin????

BTW, VIPs are 50 and VIP PKG (???) are ONLY 75!? That?s a stellar deal...

Or not.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday September 27 GOLDIE & BAILEY at the Redzone

Gosh danggit.  I always miss the shows.  My sister was in columb going to 
see good charlotte play.  She was there all weekend long.  This came up way 
too quick and all...funk a duck.

This sounded fun, I should have made it out.  Columbus is a long way away.  
Well not really if you drive 90 the whole way there.  Then its only an hour 
and a half.  :teeth:

Would have been nice to meet some folks too.  I was all a social butterfly 
this week too...grrr.oh well..

There'll be shows next time..

Wow.  That isn't it at all; I really don't think you realize what
computers can do, given enough thought and work.

I'm not talking about making a computer into a trance DJ that layers the
last ten seconds a song with the next.  I'm excluding scratch turntablism,
for the most part.

I'm not sure if 95% of DJ's are capable of producing an unforgettable set.
But I think the perfect example of the anti-computer DJ would be Feelgood,
or someone like him; you look up midway through his set, and he's standing
there bouncing, happy, with this big grin on his face.

That's the biggest thing the computer can't give ya.  :)

Say you wanted to hear a DJ that lives geographically distant.  And you're
in Pittsburgh, so interest in this particular DJ is only going to bring
100-200 people.  The flight will cost more than the DJ can bring in.  If
said computer can do a better job live than a recorded set from that DJ,
it might be worth doing.

Say you could listen to an enormous-cost DJ, or a version of him/her
that's nearly as good.  But instead of $30 cover, it's $5.  Or free.
Maybe, just maybe, the variety something like that would give you could
get more people to come out, and local DJs could get the respect that many
of them deserve.

That aside, looking at it from a business standpoint, the 'rave scene'
isn't worth dropping the money on automating a DJ.  The club scene in
general, however, will never die; having a way to replace DJs with a fixed
cost item is always profitable.  And the people listening to the tracks in
the club scene could EASILY be dancing to a bad computer program, and
never, ever notice or care.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

Add groovetech to the list of record stores that had to close their doors.
Here is the letter I saw about it.

Internet Music & Media PLC
18 September 2003

To be embargoed for
18th September, 2003

Internet Music & Media plc ('IMM' or 'the
Company')

Closure of Subsidiary

IMM announces that the directors of its wholly
owned subsidiary, Groovetech
Limited, have resolved that it should cease
trading. Groovetech Limited was
established to sell product to the UK and Europe
and has never been profitable.

The directors of IMM are assessing the impact of
the closure of Groovetech
Limited on the operations of Groovetech LLC, the
US subsidiary of IMM. In the
meantime, the directors of IMM have requested
that trading in its ordinary
shares on AIM is suspended, pending
clarification of the Company's financial
position.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

Its been down for a couple weeks.

I've heard people say they are 'through'...but this seems rather abrupt. 
They just might have not payed their bill.

I have been too lazy to do any further research...

What a horrible night to have a curse.

That kind of thinking leads to one thing: Milli Vanilli.

Blah. Mess. Junk. Garbage. Why not just have said deejay record a two hour mixtape and play that? at

If I want "nameless, faceless music played within a specific genre", I can stay at home and listen
to Music Choice on my digital cable box that I already pay a monthly fee to have. I can download an
MP3 of bbc's "essential mix" and listen to it.

If I'm going out, there better be someone "manning the controls".

and with some club owners not knowing the difference, it might be better than having someone play

but all that really makes it is the lesser of two evils. that doesn't make it a desirable option.

i'd be willing to bet that any deejay i know who waled into a club and found out that there was a
computer picking and playing the music would be pretty offended and not want to patronize that
place.

it's like walking into a four-star restaurant to find out they serve mcdonalds hamburgers.

you can still eat it, but why would you want to?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hang the dj?

ISDN shows were pretty popular in Europe 10 years ago or so, prior to
streaming audio.

This reminds me of threads from the ableton boards (bunch of laptop
nrrds) where people have often expressed self hatred at their
entertaining skills. Just a few things to remember to keep people in
check...

1. Your job is to get people in the door so they drink.
2. Your job is to keep people inside so they keep drinking.

So keep them entertained, plain and simple. I'm a laptop person, and you
do have to work a whole lot harder to get things moving. Projectors with
what you're up to, live sampling of vinyl, lots of instruments and stage
toys, etc. A lot of people try to get away with checking their email,
and it just doesn't work, because if you're not having a good time, it
won't transfer to the crowd.

ps. Yeah, I was really really really fucking wasted at Goldie, had some
bad shit going on, and just needed to forget for a bit. Sorry for being
so generally fucking annoying. Like I even needed to say that, but hey.

i cant believe you would even try to make us feel bad about
groovetech closing. its not like they were some mom and pop record
store being run for the love of music. they were a subsidiary of a
corporation that was supposed to run a certain profit every year.
that kind of shit can die off, id be happy.

Man, you are being argumentative for argument's sake here.  For one,
groovetech was one of the better online stores in terms of usage, audio
samples, etc etc.  The radio station had free, awesome shows.  The prices
of the records themselves were often cheaper than any other US online
store.  The sales they had were great.

I think it was one of the Rolling Stone's members who was one of the chief
investors in Groovetech.  I don't think it was some greedy
mega-corporation that was out to fleece everyone, or at least, if they
were, I don't think Groovetech would have been Groovetech.

i dont think guys from the rolling stones are really interested in
making sure the dance music scene goes far. anyway, i really could
give a fuck about groovetech. in 6 years of ordering records from
the internet, i never once ordered from them. i hated their
website sooooo much, i pretty much never even looked at it.

Well you're stupid then, you really should have looked at their website.
You probably would have gotten a ton of good stuff, a lot cheaper than you

musicesp.com and found shit i couldnt find anywhere. groovetech

Correct, they're interested in making a product that sells. And if they
did it, and did it well, so what if they're corporate greedy fucks?

Wal-mart of record shops? Can there really be such a thing? They sell
RECORDS for christ's sake.

Groovetech was an excellent store, thier real-time inventory 
control was on point, which elimintated a lot of the guesswork 
that consumers encounter when ordering records online. I only used 
them every so often, since their stock was always couple of weeks 
behind other sites and we all know i'm crackhead when it comes my 
vinyl. The site was ann excellent resource for the casual shopper 
in my opinion (those who only purchase once or twice a month),so 
these consumers my get lost in the shuffle. I would suggest those 
of people who are missing groovetech, to hit up their local record 
store or find a closer online alternative (720, milk, bent crayon, 
etc) and if that doesn't work out, try planet x. I know there's a 
lot of PX haters out there, but i've been shopping there since '94 
(before it was online only) and they've have always treated me 
well.

Yeah tom is just being dumb on this one. Because HE didn't shop there, it
must suck.  I didn't order from there often, but they always had good
stuff.  They even carried the technoir records.. which I don't think you'd
really find in a "walmart" type of store.  if anything "the love of the
music" kept them open as long as it did.

Anytime you run a business you are in it to at least break even.  The
problem with things like groovetech is the business model.  Expensive site
to maintain, a studio, probably too many employees, competing with lower
prices, dependence on high volumes of record sales, leads to big hits when
records stop selling as well.

Exactly.  For my latest online store, I am trying to model the good things
about groovetech, but deliver it in a less than $250,000 site.   (I will
post this soon when it's done this week).

Groovetech helped me out IMMENSELY when I was exploring my techno
interests, since they made it easy to hear other records from the same
artist, sort records by sub-genres, etc.  And I think it had been helping
Paul Fleetwood do the same.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

here's my "me too" post.

here's what was good:
1) easy searching (label, artist, genre/sub-genre, new releases...even 'top 40 sellers')
2) comprehensive samples - the may not have a sample of every track, but if it was a 3x12", there'd
be at least one sample from each record. that's my biggest complaint with juno besides the
outrageous shipping.
3) the samples also helped me check out what's going on in other genres that i didn't know a lot
about that helped me discover some new stuff, or stuff that crosses genres.
4) ordering was easy
5) delivery was fast. (i've had some orders show up next-day even when i had them ship via ground)

i'm disheartened to hear that they never made money, beause as far as shopping experiences with
online stores go, they were the best i'd seen.

as an addendum, i think it's kind of lame that the parent company didn't even keep a 1-page splash
with a "sorry, we're gone, but thanks for all your support" kind of thing up there. that is the only
thing i've seen that lends creedence to tom's argument about 'big business' and not caring about the
community.

HUH?

It was NOT my intention to make anyone feel bad about groovetech.  It was,
however, my intention to hopefully spark something inside a persons head
that says "WAKE UP".

This is my opinion about shopping online, take it for what you will.

SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SCENE.

Those who don't shouldn't be playing locally - in any city.  That is the
bottom line and should be end of discussion - I don't care about all your
politics and drama.  That shit will tear things apart every time.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

you really don't know the difference between buying needles at guitar center
vs buying them at joe's vinyl shop ?  you don't see the difference between
buying vinyl from a subsidiary of some big corporation vs supporting local
shops run by actual human beings who live, breathe, create, participate and
fuel the clubs, raves, house parties where these records are intended to be
enjoyed ?

in the spirit of groovetech, listen to adam freeland's latest -

I couldn't agree with you more Doug, except in 
the case where the local record store doesn't carry
what you spin :]

Oh yeah..I still am meaning to pick up that Hadshot
vinyl from you. Don't sell it!

That's another issue altogether, but you are right to a degree.

In the case of Goa, the titles are very obscure and don't go through normal
channels of distribution.  If I could be guarenteed to sell a large chunk of
it weekly,  then I would seek out the distributors that carry it.   The
stuff you are odering is not the same stuff available to everyone:  ex
satellite, groovetech, primal, dance records, planetx, etc.

Next time you place a large order, send the list with Artist/Title/Label to
your local store and see what they can do.

what the hell:

I used them and PX for about 95% of all my records (a whopping 40 or 
so, lol).  Mainly because I didn't really know about any local ones, 
Then like the last few records I've gotten were from grand poobahs 
(however you spell that) and it's about the same price as getting 
them from groovetech + shipping.  Although I'll admit I used them a 
lot to listen to samples of a record before I get them.  I just got a 
record off ebay and went to there to see if it was listed, although 
it's an older track, but they weren't up then either (like mid last 
week).  Just assumed it was some internet hicup or something.  I 
thought groovetech was one of the bigger and better stores out there, 
sad that they didn't profit.  I pretty much aggree with whoever it 
was that said their business model was probably messed up, too much 
"redundent overhead" if you will.

fuck all y'all.

im glad groovetech is closed. i hated that joint. sure, there are 
the lovers of this shoppe, but thier selections was shite. (unless 
you were several weeks behind) like jwan, i like to be up todate 
on the selections, (and in some cases several months ahead!) 
groovetech from this standpoint did not meet standards. sure it 
had fancy bells and whistles, but at the end, it just did not meet 
my expectations.

Planet X can kiss my natural black ass too(sorry jwan). thier 
service is great, IF YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THERE.

I like a record store that KNOWS it's customers. a store where 
they do thier best to accomodate. that stocks product i need,want, 
and didnt know that i needed! i want knowlegeable people working 
the shoppe. Bent Crayon,720 and Milk have met and exceeded these 
expectations on multiple occasions. I also look to the labels 
themselves to grab pieces that im looking for, AND i hit several 
obscure stores to get to what i need. i'd say groovetech is for 
your "bulk" orders, your "casual" orders and your "convieniece".
ive used groovetech ONLY WHEN I HAD TO. groovetechs BIGGEST flaw 
was its "cold" approach to interaction with its customers. 
groovetech's loss is the afforementioned store's gain!

but, like i and others have said look to milk,bent crayon and 720. 
stay out of 611..that shoppe is for suckahs.

so when you see jim,kelly,(but not jim kelly), or john in the 
street, say something nice, and then beg them for that latest Hooj 
choons record that you need...(whats this? Hooj choons gone? shit!)
i'm certain they'd like to help you out...of all the money in your 
wallet!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

Goddess Kelly sez:
<<you don't see the difference between buying....from a subsidiary of some big corporation vs
supporting local
shops run by actual human beings who live, breathe, create, participate and fuel the clubs, raves,
house parties where these records are intended to be enjoyed ?>>

I think the fact that they did sell well and _STILL_ closed down is telling of the state of chaos
that exists right now.

There is some good music being made today, and a lot of garbage. That's not the retailer's fault,
necessarily, but I think that's where being small really helps...not as much overhead means not as
much shit to eat if it doesn't sell.

(I still stand by the suggestion that Milk should have a sale to get rid of some of the clutter and
older backstock...)

I like the fact that I can walk into Milk and the owner knows me, other people shopping there know
me, i can (sometimes) walk right up to what i'm looking for and walk home with it. Even if it's $1
more per record than online, I still make out in shipping and crap. But beyond that, there's a
relationship there that noone gets via shopping online.

Plus, I know for a fact that if Kelly don't got it, she'll look for it and try to get it. She's done
it for me.

BUT...that doesn't take away from the fact that groovetech had a fair amount of good things about
their business. Their site was well-organized, if not downright customizable. Their service was
good. Their delivery was good.

As a matter of fact, I didn't know that they were owned by "big faceless corporation" until it was
brought up in this thread. I suppose I just assumed it was a small operation that got bigger over
time.

Like I said, I used it to learn about stuff that I came and bought from Milk...because,
unfortunately, I can't be at milk 8 hours a day and get paid for it....

Since I was too young at the time, I can't really know, but I wonder if this is what the mid-80's
was like...the seemingly-oppressive right leaning government, economic downturn, not a whole lot of
clubs, the tail end of disco (compared with the seeming tail end of rave today...or so many have
said) and a glut of average music (pre-the next development)?? Is there something brewing down there
somewhere that's waiting to bust things open the way acid house did in '88??

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

I hear ya Doug, the problem is....if people aren't
exposed to the genre, how can they know they want
to buy it? I think it works both ways. One of the
reasons Cleveland doesn't have a psytrance scene is
because the local record stores don't promote or
sell it. Cleveland has been force fed house music..
nothing wrong with that. I love house, but when I 
go through your trance bins it's really frustrating 
to see that there is only mainstream stuff available. 
I'm not saying you should spend thousands of dollars
on Goa/psy inventory, but you should represent it if
you have the ability to. I know that serious trance/techno
dj's would dig the sound. I'm not bitching, just trying
to make a point that as the premier record store 
in Cleveland, you should show some love to a genre that
is huge throughout the rest of the world. I really would be
a shopper..you know that! I purchased 1/4 of my vinyl
from Fame records when it was in town. I hate knowing
that I spend minimum $100 a month on vinyl or cd's, but
it's with a euro distributor and not my local record
store! Just my .02 bro.

Peace,
Luke

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Software?

I'm really trying to refrain from saying something like "In my
experience with 12 year old kids"... but I've found that kids around
that age (6th graders) get bored and confused by sequencers and vst
plugs, etc etc. Complex synthesizers like Reaktor and MAX/MSP are way
outta their league. They want to make noise NOW. 

Reason seems to hit well with the kids, you don't have to use the
sequencer on board if you don't want to and there's about a million
instrument possibilities. (www.propellerheads.se)

About the only thing you CAN'T do in Reason is directly record, say from
a mic or a guitar. Fortunatly, Ableton Live does this well, directly
with Reason. The neat thing about Live is that you can easily fix up bad
performances, change the tempo, etc, without changing pitch. You don't
need to know anything about music to make noise with this, but it
doesn't make noises on it's own -- you have to feed it loops & samples.
(www.ableton.com). 

If both of those seem a bit out of reach (they're not cheap), I'd say
check out the demos. I rarely touch Cubase anymore except for sequencing
Reaktor synths, as these programs really do it all together, and well. 

- mike

ps. oops. just remembered nick. doh. 

pps. I've run workshops for kids & electronic music before, this is
probably the only subject I can realibly speak on besides cable porn.

That's the thing I question.... not one distributor (except the one
specializing in the genre) call it psy-trance or goa.   I've heard Euro
remies of lincoln park passed of as Acid Trance -- it's all subjective.

Now as for getting the more underground titles through that ARE available
here is where things get messed up:   If we know a label is established and
that people are looking for it, then we order.  However, it is no longer
safe to take chances.  This is the issue of cause and effect I have been
getting at:

We used to profit from cd & mainstream music sales.  Now one guy buys a
ministry of sound cd, and we loose 4-6 sales because he burns it for all of
his friends.  Cd singles are all but extinct.  That is money we once used to
fund the underground.

It is not my point to whine or complain, however, it is my point that there
is cause and effect.   Because dj unknown doesn't buy music, there isn't a
scene left to support his music when it becomes available.   That's what I
meant the other day when I basically said fuck all you enablers - expecially
djs who profit from reselling already stolen product in the form of a mix
cd.

So... my point is that I can't start ordering titles that I don't know are
going to move.  Just like I don't order techno - because bent crayon is next
door.  Perhaps there is something we can discuss privately that would allow
for the promotion of psy-trance in the local market.

They did a pretty good job at keeping things organized compared to other 
large online stores. It was very easy to browse for music, which then made 
it easier to listen to more artists and labels I wouldn't otherwise.

Digging hurts my back, clickng doesn't...

Just a valuable resource no longer availible. It sucks, but hopefully it 
will help out the local scene...

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

i love planet x, and while i know some of the people who run it now,
when i fist started ordering from them i always had great service.  i
always got extras in my box, like slipmats, stickers, whitelabels, etc.
i''ve turned a bunch of techno and house djs in c-bus on to planetx and
almost every one of buys all their music from them.

as far as buying locally, i would if a decent record store existed in
columbus that carried what i wanted.  roots records primarily carries
reggae, dub, hip-hop, and dnb but hardly carries techno and house.  all
city beats caters towards the hard-house, trance, and jungle djs.  clay
told me that since i was virtually to only person who bought deep house
and techno in his store that he wasn't going to carry it anymore.
culture 7 and world record were ok, but never had the selection of
planet x.  

now, if bent crayon were in columbus i'd be all over that.  john's got
such a great selection of music i never walk out of there with less that
10 records.  his techno, electro, and house sections are incredible.  i
would definitely prefer actually going into a store and digging through
piles of records, talking shop with the owners, and all that good stuff
over ordering online.  there just isn't anywhere local to do it.

Planet X can kiss my natural black ass too(sorry jwan). thier 
service is great, IF YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THERE.

I like a record store that KNOWS it's customers. a store where 
they do thier best to accomodate. that stocks product i need,want, 
and didnt know that i needed! i want knowlegeable people working 
the shoppe. Bent Crayon,720 and Milk have met and exceeded these 
expectations on multiple occasions. I also look to the labels 
themselves to grab pieces that im looking for, AND i hit several 
obscure stores to get to what i need. i'd say groovetech is for 
your "bulk" orders, your "casual" orders and your "convieniece". ive
used groovetech ONLY WHEN I HAD TO. groovetechs BIGGEST flaw 
was its "cold" approach to interaction with its customers. 
groovetech's loss is the afforementioned store's gain!

it shows who will pull out when the going gets tough.  to me, it's when i
can't pay the rent and utilities to keep my shop open.

when's the last time you were in ?  there are about 8 crates of half off
records here.  things change on almost a daily basis around here, if for no
other reason than i need a change of scenery.  so yea...check out the deals on
the backstock.  people find gems on the regular.

well we have something in common then :)  and this isn't about "milk", just
for the record.

i see nothing wrong with buying online in combination with shopping locally. 
just give the local stores the chance, at least, to find what you're looking
for.  if they can't, then by all means get it where you can.

I really wish I could post a review but I barely remember what happend when we left the RedZone. Nick and Shawn what happend to you guys?...
 
Actually I really wanted to post a comment on the venue. I haven't been there since the 2nd Clockwork Sundays, and have to say the place looks really great now. I could hardly tell the difference inside from how I remembered it before. Steph and I sat down and actually walked through where all the rooms used to be and everything. Nice nice nice...
 
No more dj booth with the cage bars in front of them though. ;)
 
 
The next couple days I'll be moving into another location, so bare with me here.

Exactly.  My original point :)

If you are buying from a US website, give the local store a chance.  Chances
are they had it or can get it.  Expecially satellite - anyone who shops
there is getting NOTHING that is not available locally (they don't even pay
their bills and that fucks up the rest of us because it hurts our
distributors).  UK sites, on some things, might be a week or two in advance,
but overall its pretty much the same thing.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

well, i guess i'll pipe in here...i never cared for
groovetech anyway, just didn't like the wierd
categorization, and when they did have what i wanted,
it took me too long to find it. planetx on the other
hand always had what i wanted, although there was no
guarantee i would actually receive it, and no
guarantee that it would not be dished. still, over all
i generally got everything or nearly everything i
wanted, and the stuff i didn't get was usually if not
always old, so i can understand, and their customer
service people always were excellent in dealing with
my stupid mistakes like double ordering things and
needing to cancel things after order, etc. i'd still
order from them, but these days my record buying is
largely restricted to for-gig buying, which means i
buy them the day of the gig and can't be waiting a
week to get my shit. plus i like supporting kelly,
because she supports me. there you have it.

Your loss?  They stocked a lot of good tunes, were one of the better
online stores, and were relatively low-cost on their vinyl...

and when you have big time investors you need to pay back, its 
about more than just "breaking even". its called you have to pay 
these people whatever they agreed on and if you dont they pull 
out. thats the love of music at work.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

<<when's the last time you were in ? >>

admittedly, it's been too long. i'll be over after work. :-P

<<there are about 8 crates of half off records here.  things change on almost a daily basis around
here, if for no other reason than i need a change of scenery.  so yea...check out the deals on the
backstock.  people find gems on the regular.>>

i know i have. that's the beauty of in person shopping that online ordering struggles to cope with:
the impulse buy, or the lucky find.

in a store, your fingers are bound to touch at least one thing you weren't specifically looking for,
and if you're paying attention, you could pick up something you forgot about or something you didn't
even know you wanted. that's why there's a whole sub-culture devoted to crate digging....

<<i see nothing wrong with buying online in combination with shopping locally. just give the local
stores the chance, at least, to find what you're looking for.  if they can't, then by all means get
it where you can.>>

i agree wholeheartedly. i wouldn't have cared as much a year ago, before i knew you well, and before
i lived and worked geographically close to the best shop of its kind in pittsburgh. and i've also
discovered that shopping at local places (including hypervinyl...where are they now??) has opened me
up to new sounds and taken my interests elsewhere. since then, i haven't ordered online, and what i
have bought (less than i'd like) i have bought from your store for that very reason. selection,
convenience and familiarity.

but you have to be painfully aware, kelly, that you can't please all the people all the time. i wish
there were more sound samples available. i'd probably do even more cross-genre buying than i do now.
i think groovetech served a good purpose in that they put forth a well organized, thorough resource
for people to shop and discover new stuff.

that said, i know you and the folks there work to make milk what it is, and when i suggest or
criticize, i try to do so constructively... in hopes that it sparks an idea with you that will make
your store more successful and keep you doing what you love to do longer, because i believe you ARE
a valuable resource.

MATTHEW DEAR (live)
Ghostly International. +8.  Perlon. Spectral. Ann Arbor/Detroit.

Matthew Dear has established himself as one of the most
promising Techno producers in the world.  His most recent
excursions have found him at the doorsteps of the
minimal-but-funky regime of techno music.

Inspired by pioneers like, Mike Inc., Thomas Brinkmann, and
Ricardo Villalobos, Dear has ingested, manipulated and
re-introduced his version of this always changing and innovative
realm of sound creation.  While he gained early recognition with
several releases on the Detroit / Ann Arbor based labels Ghostly
International and Spectral , recent acceptance into Ritchie
Hawtin's (aka Plastikman)  legendary Plus 8 roster and the
ever-popular Berlin based, Perlon label has solidified Dear's
place as a leader and trendsetter in Techno.

While he employs several aliases for different labels and
philosophies, his sound is unified by his desire to push the
boundaries of modern dance music while at the same time remain
focused on the simple goal of making people dance.  Fresh off of
a Summer-long European tour, and a highly acclaimed performance
at last Spring's Detroit Electronic Music Festival, Matthew Dear
will be making his debut Ohio performance at Proceed.

GEOFF WHITE (live)
Edit. Persona. Force Inc. Morris Audio. Columbus.

Columbus-based Techno producer Geoff White has become one
of the most talked of and substantial new artists to emerge in
America.  With a handful of critically acclaimed 12" and full
length releases on Force Inc., Persona, Cytrax, Morris Audio,
Delay, and his own label Edit, Geoff White has positioned
himself as an outstanding member of the techno community.  In
addition to his solo productions, he has worked with several
notable techno figures including Sutekh, Safety Scissors, and
most recently Stewart Walker on the amazing "Dischord" release
on Force Inc.

His music is characterized by deep and dubby syncopated swinging
rhythms layered with equal parts texture and mood. Employing
experimental recording techniques, Geoff White crafts a sound
that is unique and intriguing, while still remaining downright
groovy.  At Proceed, Geoff White will give his farewell Columbus
performance before relocating to Barcelona, Spain.

with DJ support from:

Titonton Duvant: Fresh back from his 19th tour of Europe,
Titonton Duvant continues to expand his reputation as an
innovator and a Columbus based ambassador of electronic music to

length albums, on labels such as UK based 2000 Black and
Visions, as well as the Italian label Archive, and his own
Residual Recordings, to name just a few.

He has recently been signed to Bitasweet, the Bugz in the Attic
label based in London.  He is also a new member of the Jazzanova
Compost label artist roster and recently remixed "Let it go,"
the second single off of the freshly released Rima album "This
World."

He is currently hard at work on his third full length album,
"Perversions." In addition to production, Mr.Duvant is renown
as a top notch performer, earning him the honor of being the
first American DJ to have performed at the definitive Broken
Beat night, Co-op, in London.

This was actually one of the things that steered me away from PX, I keep
hearing about all these people getting extra stuff and the three or four
times I ordered from them I didn't get anything extra.  I dunno if you
have to buy so much (I usually bought between $50 - $75 at a time there)
or what, but that always got to me.

I came across your "archives" this afternoon with the help of a close friend in the cleveland area.  I am a longtime dj out on the west coast, primarly for the enjoyment of it any more, but i am comming to see a fair amount of frustration in your area just through reading a few of your past threds.  
 
Not to be mean, and tom, no offense to you.  If Groovetech were to have been "breaking even", they would still be online today.  That is a simple business term, it means you are incurring no debt while at the same time, the company is not making money past what they owe in overhead.  Most cmopanies cant reach that point, if they could they would still be open.  And dont knock till you try it, negativaty only breeds anger.
 
Doug, you have the idea.  We have been trying to push for more of our local dj's to shop at stores.  it is less expensive (no shipping costs or danger to vinyl) and more convenient (no waiting).  I appreciate your push for the local scene, we all should try a little harder to support our local dj/scene/store.
 
Good Luck to you all

and when you have big time investors you need to pay back, its 
about more than just "breaking even". its called you have to pay 
these people whatever they agreed on and if you dont they pull 
out. thats the love of music at work.

im so confused. i wouldnt say "most" companies arent breaking
even. where are you getting that kind of generalization from?
anyway, if you have all that money behind you and cant find a way
to be breaking even, im thinking its a flawed business model
before i think its a lack of customer support. isnt this what
capitalism is all about? 

> And dont knock till you try it, negativaty only breeds anger.

i can think of way too many examples of things i dont have to try
before i know its not for me. so im not even going to begin to
argue this flawed logic.

i have no problem supporting the local shops, the 2 best of which
i work for. they dont/cant always get what i want so i go
elsewhere, and that elsewhere was never groovetech. and lord knows
ive bought enough records in my day, ive never needed to go to
them. that says something about them IMO.

to be honest its been about a year since i even looked, but i
found it much more difficult to navigate than most shops. if i
remember their genre divides were especially poor. but the site
design isnt even the main reason i never wanted to order from them. 

the places i have ordered the most from are places in the UK, one
in particular that kills it for US and UK house and garage. they
send out emails that are obviously typed out in a friendly sort of
manner, give all kinds of cool deals to their customers, even sent
me a congratualtions note when my son was born. their site
actually isnt easy to navigate at all, but their helpfulness and
personality was what made them great. and really i dont think any
online shop has ever come close to that for me. there are other
ones i would like to deal with if i had to order more stuff
because they exhibit that personality, and there are others that i
deal/have dealt with simply to get records i couldnt get
elsewhere. groovetech never did either of those things for me.

>Wow.  That isn't it at all; I really don't think you realize what
>computers can do, given enough thought and work.

hahahahahaha. no really, i think YOU arent understanding what a
human is capable of with no thought and work. you cant program a
computer to stay up all night drinking to end a rave with a set
that starts with the theme from "a clockwork orange" and goes
through dopplereffekt, ton loc, new order, and yello. thus a
computer is useless. i absolutely believe that computers can do
many non-creative things perfectly fine. ill leave my creativity
to real live people though. 

>I'm not talking about making a computer into a trance DJ that
layers the
>last ten seconds a song with the next.  I'm excluding scratch
turntablism,
>for the most part.

you cant program all the things that go into being a human. art is
an expression of that humanity. you can program deep blue to kick
ass at chess, but can you program it to get drunk and act like a
twat while spinning one of the greatest sets youve ever heard? nah. 

>I'm not sure if 95% of DJ's are capable of producing an
unforgettable set.

no, probably 99.9% arent. but that has to do with lots of factors,
one of which isnt the deejays' lack of perfection. honestly, when
you think about the variables that would make a good set one place
for one group of people a horrible set in another place for other
people, it just adds up to way more work than its worth for an
inferior product. 

>But I think the perfect example of the anti-computer DJ would be
Feelgood,
>or someone like him; you look up midway through his set, and he's
standing
>there bouncing, happy, with this big grin on his face.

thats still not even what im talking about. there are certain
things that no amount of logic programming is going to hit on, and
personality is one of them. you can try to imprint the personality
of the programmer on the computer, but even that is going to be
flawed as that person wont be able to actually experience every
possible iteration of variables that a computer could see so the
chances that it wouldnt react the same way the live deejay would
are high.

it absolutely cant do a better job. at least a recorded set will
have personality. if you cant see who you want, drive somewhere
else. cleveland and columbus both frequently get great deejays who
dont come here. and many festivals exist that lots of people go to
in order to hear all their favorites. id rather drive to detroit
to hear theo parrish play records than to stay here and try to let
a computer approximate him. shit, the thought of that even coming
close makes me want to laugh.

the variety of local deejays is really off the hook, even in a
small city like pittsburgh. lack of variety isnt whats keeping
people home, nor is it admission price. you can hear tons of shit
for free every week, and people still stay home. what people pay
for is vibe. you cant program that shit.

if you mean the most superficial people in the club scene, then
youre right. most people id say that go out to hear good deejays
are at least partially educated.

really the sad state of affairs dictates that only morons wouldnt

technology is used to pacify those kinds of idiots i really cant
say that i care. to be honest i dont care if wack club deejay
Homohead has a job spinning at Donzi's. but i do care that Brother
Mike is the resident at havana on thursday night. that is some
serious shit right there, and any attempt to fuck with that kind
of thing will certainly be met with the utmost hostility on my part.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hang the dj?

It's time to get the silverraver involved in this thread... PVD + 2
Powerbooks + Turntable = Love Parade Madness.

A computer is just a tool yo, much like yourself. If someone can make mad
dance choons with a washboard and spoons, make sure everyone is having a
good time, etc, why does it even matter?

A computer isn't going to run itself, there has to be SOME level of user
interaction... and the user interaction no matter what the media is what
it's all about.

Word,

Mike

Buffalo recipies vary a bit, mostly on the issue of Everclear. Generally
(courtest webtender.com):

1 fifth Gin
1 fifth 151 proof rum
1 fifth Gold tequila
1 fifth Vodka
1 fifth Tennessee whiskey
Selection Fruit
2 cans Fruit punch
Ice cubes

And let sit overnight....

As a quicker setting fruity alternative, try sangria -- it's perfect sangria
weather.

If you're just looking for tasty fuck-me-up, try Duvel if you can find it.
It's a belgian beer that tastes like kool aid, but comes in at a hefty 8.5%.
It tastes nothing of beer, but lots of pear and apple flavor. A little
pricey, but probably cheaper than all that liquor.

ps. don't pour Duvel faster than you could squeeze the liquid out of an eye
dropper.

I really did like Jirah's music alot. I just didn't feel the energy in
his set. Maybe it's because he followed Onnomon which was an experience
out of this dimension! Great party tho Dan! Great music too!
Your boy Psyphon is extremely talented. You always hook up the 
good events! I look forward to your next one. I hope to see you out in 
Cleveland for Kri and Blue Spectral Monkey. 

Peace brotha,
Luke

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday September 27 GOLDIE & BAILEY at the Redzone


1. The soundman shouldn't have to cover for incompetance, although the
crowd's gonna blame shitty sound on the club, not the DJ.

2. The Pioneer 500 and 600's have a knob on the back that does the same
thing, as far as I remember.  No pulling the face off it, just tweak the
knob before anyone else is in the club.  Then again, those aren't exactly
the optimal mixers for everything.

Subject: {pb-cle} Club in DC that's probably worth a drive


There's a new club night in DC, called Re:Mix.  (www.remixdc.com)

It actually looks good.  It's in a 20,000 sq ft. building that reminds me
of the Irish Center on steroids.  The promoters, it seems, have been in
the scene for 10+ years, and are more rave than club.  It's about a 3.5 hr
hike from Pb, maybe 5 from Cle...  (Which is probably too far, but...)

Anyways, the reason I'm ranting is that they have the Bassbin Twins coming
in next week.  I haven't seen them on a flyer, at an event, or anywhere,
for quite a long time.

And I'm actually psyched about a club night, for a change.  Who knew?

-D

Easton is awesome.  I used to work at the Office Max on Morse Rd. right by

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} visiting Columbus

Depends on how long you'll be visiting. You can check out shopping
anywhere, but if you want to see something you won't see everywhere, go
to the crazy bookstore in the german village (there's like 30 rooms
here?) and get some schmidt's sausage haus buffet in ya. Don't forget
the cream puff @ schmidt's! If you hit it on a sunday, you MIGHT get to
see schnicklefritz. 

http://homepage.mac.com/skord/.Pictures/Photo%20Album%20Pictures/2003-06-21%2020.17.30%20-0700/Image-D50A5A6CA45F11D7.jpg

They have a better stage act that pink floyd or kiss. 

Columbus also has it's share of good breweries (although a few have
disappeared to the ages). The Barley's Smokehouse on 33
(dublin/riverside rd) has a totally badass imperial stout on draft now.
There's also the Elevator downtown, but I'm not as partial to their
beers as I am Barley's. 

If you ever feel like a burger that will make you explode, the Thurman
Cafe on Thurman St. in the german village is also good stuff. Run by a
family of macedonians, they make food in portions you can't get your
mouth around -- but it's soooo good.

The original Max & Erma's restaurant is also in the german village. It's
the same crap they serve everywhere else, but you could say you were
there. 

I tend to agree with Ed and have to say I'm a Barrister Hall fan. I've
heard some great jazz there, and the atmosphere is great. Good scotch
collection too. 

Bento next to the newport has decent sushi, but better alcohol and
decent house.

And, you can always just walk around the short north or brewery
districts until you can't see straight. 

The only thing I will say is that the Arena district really isn't all
that exciting. Bleh. It's like a giant entertaining applebees or
something. Well, I really can't say that, but I don't think the area
really represents this cow town. 

Word,

Mike

Tom, I am assuming you argue with most everyone on this list, especially if they are throwing "monkey pooh" at you.  I have no fued with you.  Groovetech was much more then just a store, especially to the people of Seattle and San Francisco.  It was a radio station to many of them.  Many big time and small time dj's were represented in those areas.  I myself had many friends who were recorded and aired by groovetech.  It was free air time and they were using a record store to support the radio.  There is no more greater show for the community and the music then their actions.  We all saw it comming out here, when, last year the San Francisco location closed.  To run those servers on what they were doing was bound to fail, not due to an unsuccessful business model, but an supporting scene of individuals.  They were not perceived as a local store, but a giant among small stores.  When in fact, they were a radio station only supported by a store, trying to keep the opportunity of free
 music and free radio alive.  Most everyone has listened to at least one mix on Groovetech, that was its true purpose.

That is a simple business term, it means you are incurring no debt
while at the same time, the company is not making money past what
they owe in overhead. Most cmopanies cant reach that point, if
they could they would still be open. 

im so confused. i wouldnt say "most" companies arent breaking
even. where are you getting that kind of generalization from?
anyway, if you have all that money behind you and cant find a way
to be breaking even, im thinking its a flawed business model
before i think its a lack of customer support. isnt this what
capitalism is all about? 

> And dont knock till you try it, negativaty only breeds anger.

i can think of way too many examples of things i dont have to try
before i know its not for me. so im not even going to begin to
argue this flawed logic. 

>Doug, you have the idea. We have been trying to push for more of
our local dj's to shop at stores. it is less expensive (no
shipping costs or danger to vinyl) and more convenient (no
waiting). I appreciate your push for the local scene, we all
should try a little harder to support our local dj/scene/store.

i have no problem supporting the local shops, the 2 best of which
i work for. they dont/cant always get what i want so i go
elsewhere, and that elsewhere was never groovetech. and lord knows
ive bought enough records in my day, ive never needed to go to
them. that says something about them IMO.

only the one that's across from the convention center by yankee 
trader (also a good place to look for weird party supplies and 
costumes), barleys has sour kraut balls as an appetizer that are 
phenomenal.

Thurmonds has good burgers, but if you're in the mood for italian 
food with the best service in town, check out Paul Panzini's 
pantry on 5th and northstar in grandview.  Killer REAL italian 
food at incredibly affordable prices (~10-14 bucks a plate).. and 
the service is like none other, at least every time i've went 
there (probably about 30 times)... 

If you're looking for an irish pub, I have always had a place in 
my heart for Byrne's Pub on 3rd Ave in grandview, so grab some 
food at Pauls, then go play some darts and drink black and tans 
while the irish jukebox is bumpin.. lol

Just don't waste your time and money at Long Street Live and 
you'll come out alright.

I would like to run a radio station like that two.  But there's a little
issue with needing bandwidth :)  Only real option is to colocate a
streaming server somewhere nearby, which will run ya about $100/month. 
Local places (northeast ohio) that I've looked into charge 100 for your
own server.  There are a couple that you can use their server for
100/month, but don't have as much storage space as you can throw in your
own.  Although unless you plan on archiving it, no real reason for a lot
of space, besides selling it out to people to pay for the server :)

i: want a colocated server... Just for the heck of it... for free :)

Okay... so what/where is Easton?  A google search was not very informative 
(too many matches), except to give me the impression that it's a 
neighborhood somewhere.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} visiting Columbus

Grandview is full of cool shit (byrnes, paul panzini's), I'm so happy I
work there. 

Note: Byrnes has A pizza place next door that's good stuff, and you can
order it through a hole in the wall. 

If you're feeling decidedly non-alcoholic, there's a coffee shop called
Stauf's on grandview avenue -- they roast their own every day, and the
roaster is in plain sight, which is kinda cool. It's owned by the owner
of Spagio, a restaurant a few doors down, who's specialty is actually
pasteries. So go for the coffee, stay for some flourless chocolate cake.
There's also a wine/cigar shop right there too owned by the same folks.

On the same strip, is the Drexel, which shows independant type films, in
a older type theatre. 

If you're looking for 15-30 minutes of entertainment, there's a little
magic store on 5th avenue two doors down from Panzini's Pantry run by a
guy named David. With all the money I spend there, tell him I sent you
and he'll cut off a chicken's head and put it back on or something. 

There's the old bag of nails pub here too, best fish and chips in town
(good luck finding it, I won't even try to explain, although it's right
off northwest by a park). 

A newer addition to the grandview area is the Brazenhead pub. Not nearly
the run down peice of shit Byrnes is (but I LOOOOVE byrnes, don't get me
wrong, run down shit is it's character), it's got more of an upscale
atmosphere, but it's not really upscale. Reminds me of the pub @ NY NY
in vegas. It's great if you've got a group of 6-8 people, since they
have these little alcoves you can sit in where you can actually talk and
not be distracted by the noise of the pub. It's west of Olentangy River
Rd. on 5th avenue, on the south side of the street. 

If you feel like a pizza, Rotolo's in grandview is great. Homemade
everything goes into it. 

The Knotty Pine is a BBQ joint + bar on third avenue, that really has
cleaned it's act up (in the last few months). Everything is smoked over
the course of a few days that you eat there. Atmosphere kinda sucks
still, but they take their time with their BBQ. 

BUT, by far, the BEST thing about Grandview (we are talking a Columbus
suburb here) is the beer and wine shops. On your way out of town, stop
by Gentiles (corner of King & Northstar) which doesn't exactly have the
biggest selection of beers & wines, but by far has the best quality
wise. Great selection of Belgians! Don't be afraid to ask either, these
guys all know their shit.

We're sitting here counting, and there has to be at least 10 TOP quality
beer & wine stores in Grandview, or within two miles of it. Some of them
look like holes in the wall, but you'll find crazy shit inside. I dunno
where you're from, but if it's PA, you might want to stock up before you
have to come back to IC & IC Light. (yeah, they sell that here too,
bleh)

Ok, I'll STFU now.

Wee!

- Mike

I put a techno mix up on the website, it isn't as tight as I'd like it to
be so I won't be handing it out except to maybe one or two people. but you
can download it.  It showcases some of Shawn and Technoir's material,
including 4 of the cuts from TNA003.  Private feedback is very much
appreciated.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} visiting Columbus

It's easy to find. 

I270 is a circle that surrounds Columbus, bisected by I71 north and
south, and I70 east and west. Easton is in the Northeast quadrant off
I270, you can't miss it, it has it's own exit that says "EASTON". 

Just do yourself a favor and go during the day. If you are there at
night, avoid the gameworks, the movie theatre, and parking in the garage
-- everything else is fine.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} visiting Columbus


To answer the WHAT is easton... it's probably one of my favorite 
shopping areas, and I hate shopping areas.  It's like part 
outdoor, part indoor, and then there are small strip malls in the 
surrounding streets... the fountains are cool, they usually have 
live music of some sort at the fountains (usually some guy with 
kinda long hair singing white blues)... They've got just about any 
store you'd want to go to, including the Apple store, which is 
cool just to drool over phat hardware made into art that is 
overpriced for most of us... (speaking of which, anyone want to 
sell a G3 or G4 laptop for a reasonable price?  I really want 
one.)... 

Better than the technical directions that Mike gave to get to 
easton... take 70 East or 670 east if you are within the 
outerbelt/city limits... go north on 270 (the outerbelt), you 
can't miss it.  either that or just mapquest the intersection of 
easton way and easton loop cause i'm sure this link will wrap.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} visiting Columbus

Easton is the coolest shopping center in ohio.

I saw Dara spin in the Virgin Megastore there.

I eat there every time I am in Columbus, there are some yummy spots (that
overpriced steak house is not one of them).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} visiting Columbus

And DOH, I totally forgot the Krema Nut company... they're the oldest
peanut butter factory in the USA, they've been on the food network a few
times, etc. Nothing goes into their stuff but peanuts, and it's totally
different than anything you buy in the store since there's no vegetable
oil, fillers, etc. Spanish peanuts get roasted a few handfuls at a time,
so it's not exactly cheap, but you get what you pay for. They've also
got cashew butter and almond butter that's mega tasty. Grandview again,
Goodale Avenue, www.krema.com. 

Last but not least, get some Graeter's ice cream. (www.graeters.com)
Made in small batches in a method where air doesn't get whipped in, it's
the densest ice cream you can buy. A pint outweighs ben and jerry's 2:1,
and it hands down beats anything you can get anywhere else. It's no
wonder that Columbus is America's 6th fattest city. (men's health,
somewhere). 

Ed, we should write a book.

place was in the movie little man tate, it can't be all that bad 
to check out, right?), the Out R Inn should be checked out in the 
summer, as it is constantly in Playboy's top ten summer college 
bars... darts, basketball, billiards, large deck patio... the area 
up by campusview on 23, with the imax theatre, dick clarks 
american bandstand, bravo, etc... the sushi places in town i 
always frequented were Shoku and Haiku... with right by Haiku is 
that one italian style restaurant.. fuck, can't remember the 
name... yeah book, write the book.

Bon Vie, Brio, and PF Changs are my favorites.   I've had dinner at night on
that Bon Vie patio -- very nice.  Smith & Wollensky reminded me a lot of
miami and a cool place to drink at -- but the ribs were not good at all.
We have a PF Changs up here in Cleveland, but I haven't been there yet.
Oh... there was a really good sushi place somewhere in Easton as well... it
fucking rocked.  They served a saki that overpoured onto a plate.

I recommend PF Chang's to anyone. There is one in Waterfront (pgh) too. Its 
not priced too steep and they try to make your experience great. The steamed 
dumplings, lettuce wraps, and especially the seared ahi tuna appetizers are 
fantastic.

I think Akil scared them all away.

... seriously though ... i was hanging out with some quality females in the 
back of the joint ... but I agree ... the man to women ratio was a bit 
disturbing at some points ... at one time during the night when I was 
watching the door some guys came up and were yelling - "don't go into 
havana- it's all dudes!"

having half of technoir and the allstar game all sitting out in front of the 
place ... wrestling and what not with each other doesn't help matters much 
either ... just kidding ... the lady at the unimart telling me she was going 
to call the cops on everyone was sort of amusing ...

face it ... technoir is intimidating ... their techno will destroy you ...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

Yeah exactly.  I mean in small towns its hard for records to come down the 
pipe.  Places like groovetech were good because they got you your records 
easier.  Sorry if this doesn't make any sense today has been one of those 
days...:teeth:

But now that groovetech is shut down what does that mean?  It won an award 
last year and everything?  what happened?

I guess places like chemical and juno will get more attention.. they had 
faster shipping times than groovetech most of the time for me anyway..

juno has some of the slowest shipping ive ever experienced. id get 
packages from them a month after i ordered them with german 
postage on them. i cant even imagine what those guys were smoking. 
chemical on the other hand was fabulous. id order on monday and 
that shit would be on my doorstep on thursday. from england. and 
their overseas shipping was mad cheap, like 2 pounds iirc. i never 
liked the way they entered their new releases, but you cant fuck 
with that kind of shipping service and price.

i ordered from them nearly every week from 2001 through mid 2002. 
so it is possible that they changed it. the postage was always 
this white printed label, different from any other place i ordered 
from in the uk. theyre not the best place to find hidden great 
back stock, but for new stuff they rocked it.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} visiting Columbus

here's the real deal.  fuck a bunch of easton foreal.  you can get that
kind of shit in any city.

here's a nice list of stuff all within a 10 minute drive from each
other:

eats:

alana's restaurant - near high and lane.  five star restaurant w/ a new
menu printed every night $$$$$$$$$
rigsby's - in the short north on high st.  five star mediterranian
cuisine at reasonable prices.
kooma - the only place to get sushi....really.  on vine street near the
north market in the arena district.
north market - a real market with tons of great places to eat and a good
bear & wine shop.  in the arena district near kooma.  closes @ 5:00 PM
betty's - in the short north on high st.  great beer on tap (bells
oberon etc) and awesome food you can get until 2:00 AM.  this ain't no
denny's, we're talking quality.  good jukebox selection too.
the blue danube AKA the dube - north campus area on high st near huson.
bad food, but the best jukebox in the city.  all the hipsters hang out
there so be prepared.

dives:

scully's - near 4th and high st.  this is about the only good bar/club
left in c-bus.
501 - hit or miss, but usually not a bad choice.  501 park st.  in the
arena district, near the north market.
st. james tavern - small but good crowd.  great beer, cheap prices.
located on 4th and detroit.  east of the short north.

clothes:

dr. mojo - on high st very close to downtown in the short north.  if you
like your hipster denim and can drop the $150 on some jeans this is the
place to go.
avalon shoes - on high st in the short north.  i can't remember where
exactly but ask around.  great shoe boutique.

tunes:  

used kids - on high st near 17th.  by labamba's.  great place for used
vinyl and cds.  tapes too!
magnolia thunderpussy - on high near 5th.  this is the best music shop
in columbus.  i dare anybody to challenge that.

When I said the Easton thing -- it's because in comparison to Cleveland it
is very cool.

Eateries like I mentioned don't exist up here really -- you go to good
restaurant (loli, fulton, etc) up there they have a lot of character but
cost a LOT more.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down (Summary)

Buying online is easy -- it's point and click and done with.   Think about
this... remember the thread about djs being replaced by comptuers?  Same
thing... just point and click away.   Why even bother with tracks or artists
or any of of the things that give our scene identity.. Future computer
programs will just monitor crowd response and continually produce and
compose new music on the fly.  No need for anything else.  Point and click
away.  Why even bother going out?  We can just all sit in front of our
computers, point and click and listen to whatever we want at home - by
downloading for free.  No need for clubs, raves, or any of it.  Don't you
think this has had a huge effect??  No parties anymore, clubs playing non
top-40 music are empty.   I guess I'm wrong.  Ignorance is bliss.

Don't you get it?  This is a social scene.  Going to your local store to buy
records is social.  Going to the clubs is social.   Going to parties is
social.  Why do we like this music to begin with?   Isn't it because it
gives us identity?  A common bond?  Unity?  Ignorance is bliss.


With that I return to my original statement in this thread:

SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SCENE.

Those who don't shouldn't be playing locally - in any city.  That is the
bottom line and should be end of discussion - I don't care about all your
politics and drama.  That shit will tear things apart every time.


and....  a couple things about records stores...

If you go to a record store on a regular basis (every 2-3 weeks) the store
is going to get to know you.   If you like producer x, or label z,  the
store is going to make sure there are enough copies so that you get yours
and others get theirs.

Most stores will ship stuff out to you.  Priority mail is realatively
inexpensive.

A store will go out of their way to get a track for you if they don't have
it in stock.  Just as you have access to 5-10 websites to order from -
stores have access to warehouses that have more stock than the places you
order from.   There are always exceptions, expecially since labels are
pressing fewer and fewer copies, but a store can tell you the probability of
getting the track.

If you order from euro sites, some stuff does not make it to the US or to
limited stores.  That part is true... but only for a small percentage of the
tracks out there.

He who sells the most, gets the most perks.   EX:  If you buy every  record
from a certain label, and the store gets the promos, chances are you will
get the one copy a store recieves.  You know how websites show certain
tracks as new - and out of stock?  That's because they stuck their one promo
in the databass and are gauging ordering potential.  Smaller stores get the
promos and make sure they get out to the people who WANT and will use them.

thats the same bullshit sob story that rock music scene people 
spouted about disco then techno and hiphop. its a load of crap 
spewed by someone whose time is almost up. adapt or die. gotta 
love charles darwin sometimes......

>Why do we like this music to begin with?   Isn't it because it

my identity has nothing to do with what i consume. you are not 
your fucking khakis.

for one example i can speak of personally, when 2 step and broken 
beat stuff was first coming up, it was nearly impossible to find 
in this country aside from a couple labels. i got what i could 
here and that was that. i still have tons of records in those 
genres that im not sure anyone else on this continent owns. and 
this was what the VAST majority of what i was ordering was. and i 
know for detroit stuff, finding that stuff on distro lists isnt 
always possible. im not really sure why, especially when some of 
it is constantly in print.

i accept the limitations of local shops. i know that no one cares 
as much about making sure i have the records i want as I do. i buy 
whats here and order what i can but sometimes even now when i work 
at 2 different shops i have to go online to get stuff.

like i said that all depends on the genre. and hey if you think 
about it, had the uk and europe not been so intent on not 
supporting their local stuff and gone out of the way to order US 
records, who knows if electronic dance music would have ANY 
popularity here outside of the techno and house communities.
