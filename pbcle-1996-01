Does anyone know of any parties on that day, cuz it's my birthday and I want
to go to a party.  AOL sucks, and it won't let me get to the calendar, so if
anyone knows of any parties in the pb-cle area or any of ohio really, could
you post it?  The only one on the mw calendar is in toronto and that's a bit
far.

peace,

 Well..like everyone else said this party was just total madness. My 
favorites sets were Feelgood and Scott Henry, who both played incredible 
stuff in the final hours of the party. Unfortunately by then my legs were 
so sore I could barely walk, much less dance. It was over about 10. 
Usually by 8 or 9 I get kind of bored of being in the same place and need 
a change, but in this case I could have stayed there for a month or so. 
Maybe someone should work on that...a month-long party. Well anyway, my 
two complaints - the sound was too loud. It didn't seem too loud when I 
first got there, but by 9 in the morning my ears hurt so much I couldn't 
even stay in the main room. Even now I am hearing all sorts of crazy 
ringing noises still. I spent most of the night in the back of the room 
by the net-meet space. It seems like the speakers in the back were mostly 
bass and the ones on the other side of the room were mostly treble. I'm 
not sure why, I'd guess its the distance, but the treble sounds from 
across the room were just a split second behind the bass beats on my 
side. That nearly drove me insane, but once I went to the middle of the 
floor everything was fine.
 I can't even begin to list the number of people I met, both net-ravers 
and others. And there was also a bunch of hoods trying to get me to sell 
them dust even though I kept trying to explain to them that I didn't have 
any. I don't quite understand it, they said "dust?" to me as I walked by. 
I said "no thanks", they said how much for a bag, I repeated that I did 
not have any, and then they began to beg me to sell them some - rather 
bizarre.
 In summary, this party was incredible, like nothing I'd ever been to 
before. Can't wait for the next Ultraworld party.
Eric

i finally managed to hit 2 parties in the same weekend, so i decided to give
some thoughts about them.

nutcracker 12/29/95 - lakewood oh - location was U4ia (same spot as the BUMP
parties).  it was improved since then though, new sound system , plus the DJ
booth was downstairs so you could actually see the DJ.  This made the space
a lot better, but I still think there are better places for a party.  i got
there in time to see the end of dieselboy's set, which was great.  none of
the other djs stuck out to me that much, but they were all pretty good.
pretty good size crowd too.  this was a good party , worth the $10, but
the club just doesn't make it seem like a party, just a club with some good
djs.

social butterfly 12/31/95 - lorain oh - i wasn't sure how this party was
gonna go, or even if i was gonna make it.  i thought that the other major
new year's parties (vibration, lsd, star generation) might draw a lot of
this party's crowd.  plus the news said freezing rain that night, which
luckily didn't happen.  after going to a hotel party, i finally decided to
drive out to lorain.  got there around 2AM.  the spot was the eagle's nest,
same as deliverance and believe.  i was kinda surprised to see the place
totally packed.  i heard there the place was going nuts at 12, with a really
good laser show showing the countdown.  only bad thing about this party was
that afrika cancelled, which meant there was no hip-hop heard this night.
the djs that did spin were really good tho, i think the first couple sets i
heard were by goodwill and shaolin monk.  shaolin had a nice long set, with
a lot of great house towards the end.  the tagteam jungle set by
ruffian/tik-tak was great too.  the vibe was a lot higher than i've seen at
a cleveland party in a long time, lots of friendly people.  overall, this
event was one of the best around here in a while, even though it wasn't as
huge as other cities, the crowd and music were just right.  good job again
by UPS.

1st off i wanna say parents suk. i'm almost 26 & they still
treat me like a kid. my mom makes these plane reservations for 
christmas break months ahead & doesn't tell me about it. given
they haven't seen me in a year, but i really didn't wanna spend
that much time with them. so i spent most of my break seeing if
i could fly back early so i could spend new years partying with
my friends rather than my relatives.

alas, i found an opening & flew back from fresno, california to
cleveland friday night. mega thanx go out to kate (keight on 
vrave), who not only picked me up at the airport, but also 
distributed the zine in cleveland, while i was on break.

two hours after arriving in cleveland, we were off to...

THE NUTCRACKER - Holiday Productions - 12/29/95 - Cleveland, OH
---------------------------------------------------------------

we got to the party at 12:30 and kurt/RELEASE had already started
his set at midnight. there still weren't that many kids there &
i was a bit worried this party wouldn't go off (boy was i in for
a surprise). kurt's set was very dancer friendly & got some kids
on the dance floor. quite impressive since the U4IA seems to be
setup more for socializing than dancing. but moving the dj booth
from it's usual 3 story location to ground level certainly helped.

after returning the back cover art to it's rightful owner - dj sparx,
i sat down with CHINAGRRL for a little 'old skoola' chit chat. she
had brought damian/DIESELBOY to the party & didn't plan on staying
too long. i was surprised to even see her at all, since she hardly
ever goes to parties anymore. while damian kicked up the vibe with
his usual killer jungle sets. china talked about how life was easier
when she knew damian when he was 1st starting out than the b.s. she
has to go thru now of going to court & taking drug tests. chinagrrl
continues to be a source of light for many including myself.

after returning the hat shannon had left in my bag at COUP D'ETAT
to her, i started wondering where the rest of the Columbus kids were.
later on they started appearing in droves about the time Steve/SLEEPY C
came on. needless to say Steve's choice trax along w/ the influx of
out of towners from Columbus and Pittsburgh, really kicked up the 
vibe level. there were even kids blowin whistles in the back. But
the biggest surprise was seeing Michael (alroy on the net) from 
Columbus, who had brought up Ben (page on the net) from St. Louis.
unfortunately when Kate introduced me to him, i thought he was 
somebody else. jet lag was definitely getting to me & had me out 
on the side lines for most of the night. however it was good to see
all those people dancing. i was especially pleased to see the return
of ross & kurt on the dance floor. there's nothing better than 
watching two really good dancers go at it.

by the time ERIC DAVENPORT  came on, the space was packed with tons
'o happy bouncing ravahs. i stood by the booth watching the west
coast master control the wheels of steel. his set in three words:
soopah high energy! his skills are definitely up there with the
best of 'em.

speakin of the best of 'em..FEELGOOD wuz next..ohmygawd!..he blew
the roof off. the crowd wuz going mad crazy. he definetly lived up
to his name that night, as he made everybody in the house feel pretty
damn good!

we had to leave shortly after Charles's set cuz Kate had a curfew to
make. as a result we regretfully missed out on the tag team set by the
promotors of the party: my ol roomy, mike/FIFER & kevin/FUZZ. but i'm
sure they spun as well as the party went off.

--- 

VIBRATION - Ultraworld - 12/31/95 - Baltimore, MD
-------------------------------------------------

12/30/95 Saturday Night

welp being that i didn't even know i wuz going to be back for new 
year's, i didn't have a chance to plan for anything. so come saturday
night i still had no idea what i was doing. then i got this phone
call from liz, who i had just met thru kate less than a couple weeks
ago: 

liz: hi, this is liz, kate's friend, do u remember me?
  
me: uh yeah.

liz: do u know how to get to baltimore from cleveland?

me: uh yeah.

liz: cuz we're going to VIBRATION in baltimore. these two girls
just came into my store. turned out they were ravers & asked me
to go. turns out they know michael [alroy on vrave] & they're
picking him up too.

me: oh wow, i wanted to go to that party, but i heard it's sold
out.

liz: u should come with us. u can probably still get in at the
door.

me: maybe i'll e-mail lonnie, see if he can put me on the list.
he still kinda owes me one. but it might be too late.

liz: i'll call the girls & i'll call u back.

me: ok. hey how do u know my number? 

liz: remember when u left yur bag at that ele mental party?
and u had to call that girl in columbus that jamie [troutsoup
on pb-cle-raves] wuz staying at cuz he found yur bag?

me: uh yeah.

liz: well she's my roommate.

me: oh wow.

liz: well i'll call u back.

me: ok.

-      

12/31/95 Sunday 

1:30pm

liz, dawn, and dee dee pick me up at my place. we drop by kinko's
so i can pick up copies of the zine. half of all my christmas money
goes into paying for all the copies. and then we head off to columbus
to pick up michael.

4:30pm

we arrive at michael's place & drop off all of liz's stuff she had
brought home in michael's apartment.

5:00pm

we leave for baltimore.

10:00pm

we make our 1st mistake: we make a pitstop in breezewood to grab a 
bite at BK. as a result we arrive at the location at:11:50pm. there
was another reason why BK wuz a mistake but i'll get to that later.

12:00am MONDAY 1/1/96 

so i spend the beginning of 1996 the exact same way i did with the
beginning of 1995 - waiting in line to get into a party. only this
time it was in baltimore & not toronto. atleast i didn't have to
wait in line two hours before getting in. i snap a picture of all
the people waiting outside at midnight.

12:15am

we get in the door. they search our bags. dana, dee dee, michael, &
liz get in cuz they have tix. i'm stuck cuz the guard can't find me
on the list. the guards were extra tuff that night. rumor wuz they
wouldn't even let lonnie's mother in. charles feelgood talked w/ me
for a little bit, but couldn't get me in either. in the mean time
i drop off a big stack of PLRM's. finally lonnie comes down...

12:30am

lonnie: stevie!

me: boy am i glad to see you!

<big hug>

lonnie: glad u could make it!

me: u don't know how far i've traveled for this party.

<i snap a pic of lonnie by my favorite doorman - i guess i wuz listed
under PLRM instead of Stevie T>

so i walk in & the place is packed! Sun is spinning. I snap a pic of
Jason then i snap a pic of the crowd. i try in vain to look for my
friends. so i dance a little. in the middle of a spin move, i remember
about the net meet. so i start walking, trying to figure out where
the net meet wuz. when all of a sudden i came up to this sign that
read...

NET RAVERS

the first person i see is jeff (vrave) who i went to COUP D'ETAT with.
he had come down with some other cleveland ravers in another car. next
netraver wuz eric (pb-cle-raves) from oberlin, ohio. he wuz the one who
wuz passing out flyers for VIBRATION @ COUP D'ETAT. next almost immediately
i saw Spike (everyone knows Spike). big hug. gave him the pic of him &
ecto @ PASSAGE TO ULTRAWORLD. next wuz Jammin James E. another big hug.
he wuz the one that took most of the pics of PASSAGE in the zine. Joe
Apocalypse wuz the other one who took the rest. altho i don't recall
seeing him. lesse who else...Tom/Waterzooi..gave him his pic too..Yorum,
u can't miss him either..Kenji - finally we meet.      

after dropping off my stuff in the back & passing out some PLRM's, i saw
Monica from delaware, 1st tall hug..SarahS, soopah hug & a smooch! u
r da best!..later on i bumped into Dan FreeLove who i just had to buy
a drink for, even danced w/ the Man, gotta say, i'm impressed, Dan's
a pretty sharp dancer! ooh yeah i even danced a little with Spike,
whose got that swirl thing going on..that's when i met Chris Green,
i thought u were taller & a bit more social..danced w/ another net
raver w/ glowsticks, except i can't remember his name. he was short
& had a mickey mouse doll. he even lent me his glowsticks for a spin.
i gave'em back when i decided it wuzn't my thing...who else did i bump 
into? there were so many, sorry if i can't remember y'all..ooh yeah
coincidentally i even bumped into TROUTSOUP from youngstown, ohio who
not only returned my bag but indirectly got me a ride to VIBRATION thru
a series of bizarre coincidences (the story of my life). i bumped into him
on one of my many bathroom visits. that wuz the second reason we shouldn't
have gone to BK - that damn whopper gave me the shits. which wuz the main
reason i didn't do too much dancing ('fraid i'd poop my pants!).

atleast my other cleveland buds did: both kurt & brian represented well
in the circles. even kevin, andy, chris pulse, their female friends &
the rest of the cleveland posse were all dancing. on the dance floor
is when i bumped into my ole cleveland bud: trevor, now residing in DC,
who did some art for past PLRM's. he & his buds were keeping the vibe
up the whole night w/ their whistles & glow strings.   

it got so hot from all the body heat that i had to peel off some clothes.
oh yah i wuz the one wearing the blue & black soccer jersey with the
white stars on it the beginning of the night. when things got too hot,
that came off & left my white 'plur' t-shirt on. and i capped it all off
w/ a white 'hic' hat. it actually stands for hawaiian island creations,
but it wuz more like the 'hic' from ohio hat for me.

enuff about the people, let's talk about...  

THE MUSIC

1st off lemme say all the main room dj's kicked my ass all night long.
and people may complain..wah! it wuz too loud! fuk dat! da louder da  
better! bring the noise!

SUN - already mentioned him

SOUL SLINGER - abstract jungle like he played in Cleveland for 
               SANCTUARY. i think it confused the crowd more than
               anything.

HUGGY - why duz this guy remind me of Doc Martin so much? even better
        than his mixed tape. def one of my fav west coast dj's. he's
        up there w/ DJ Dan & Thomas Michael.

SPEEDY - even better than when i heard him @ TUNNELVISION. damn good
         dancer friendly mixin. Speedy also gets my vote for most
         amiable dj. spent most of the night chattin w/ him by the
         dj booth. funniest Speedy quote: 'east coast girls make me
         horny.' too bad for mr. gonzalez, he's engaged.

DB - gawd damn, this guy is good. very few dj's can pull me from all
     the way in the back to all the way in the front. the music DB   
     wuz spinning did exactly that. DB gets my vote for most energetic
     dj. dancing through out his set, waving his hands in the air.
     he's got that Carlos enthusiasm that gets the crowd going.

KARL K/MC DUB 2 - dynamic jungle duo. got the best crowd participation.
     definite respects go out to these guys. i liked it when they got
     the audience to hold up their lighters.

DIESELBOY - only jungle dj that got to me to stay in the jungle room.
     i felt bad for DJ Thad from san fran who proceeded him cuz he
     had to deal with the Dieselboy fan club waiting for him to get
     off. Damian jumped on with those shades & it wuz all over. it
     wuz also the 1st time i got to see my ole ravah bud, hossam, who
     i went to school with, mc. after some minor technical difficulties,
     he got the crowd going. most amusing damian quote in lonnie's
     apartment while we were stuck there waiting for the locksmith:
     ' i put on those sunglasses cuz i thought that light would be too
     bright..but then when i got on, i couldn't see a damn thing..
     and i couldn't take 'em off!'  second most amusing damian quote:
     'i dedicated my set to PLRM.' yah and monkeys are flying outta
     my butt!

FEELGOOD - even better than his set at NUTCRACKER friday night. Spike
     wuz right. Feelgood's wuz the set of the night. probably the
     best set i've ever heard him spin. he showed everyone why he
     is the 'build up' king! track after track of flawless high
     energy mixing. perfection. and i think he knew it too.

SCOTT HENRY - i made sure i had the best seat in the house for this
     one, right by the dj booth, behind the speakers. i got to 
     witness first hand the man at work, every tweak of the levels,
     every mix in, every mix out, and most importantly i got a 
     birds eye view of the total control he had over the audience.
     this man was a machine. no one has mastered the art of the
     mix & the beat match better than scott henry. the only slight
     mistake i caught wuz he upped the highs just a little too
     much for one song. i looked out in the audience & i knew no
     one caught it. but i knew he knew cuz he made a slight grimmace.
     there wuz this one track that he spun near the middle of his
     set. i'm pretty sure it wuz a new promo. cuz i asked speedy
     what it wuz & he didn't know. all i remember wuz it had a 
     yellow lable & no writing. but it made get off that perch &
     just totally throw down. i didn't care if i had the shits or
     the fact that we'd be stuck in baltimore for awhile cuz the
     girl who drove us to the party had gotten her bag stolen & her
     car keys were in the bag. but the most uplifting track that
     scott spun wuz that remix of 'age of love', one of the earlier
     trance tracks..'c'mon dance with me, move your body so i can
     see'. i looked out at the audience to see if anyone knew the
     importance of this song. not a single one. and then he followed
     it up with that remix of 'feel it' by Moby. those along with
     the very last track he spun were what made my night. 

OUTSIDE THE ULTRAWORLD...

after Scott Henry, Lonnie made his speech about how when we're outside
it's their world, but when we're here, we can lose our inhibitions,
and not have to worry about all that becuz we are in the ultraworld.
he was even so considerate as to mention how my friend's backpack wuz
missing.

but the greatest act of kindness was afterwards. this tall older guy
w/ a ski cap & beard who helped with the party. he let us up to lonnie's
apartment. at which point, lonnie lent us his phone, as we tried to find
a locksmith that would come out on new year's day. after going thru a
dozen locksmith, we finally found one.

so we're there hanging out with lonnie, scott henry, dieselboy, and the
centrak laser guy, steve, waiting for this locksmith. i'm sure if it
weren't for our situation, it would've been alot more fun. but there
were a few light moments w/ damian & lonnie just going off. they really
kept our spirits up, despite our awful position.

finally after paying the locksmith $175 for keys, labor, & emergency 
fee (of which $50 came out my christmas money), we were finally on 
our way back home to cleveland.

i felt the worse for dawn, she felt so bad for losing her bag & keys.
plus when she got home, her mom found out she had lied about staying
at a friends house. so on top of all that, she also got grounded by
her parents. 

welp atleast when i lost my bag, something good eventually came out
of it - i got a ride to VIBRATION. i'm sure something good will come
out of it for Dawn. she deserves something good to happen to her.

welp extremely big thank you goes out to lonnie for not only letting
me into the party, when u wouldn't even let yur mom in ;} and for 
having us at yur place & letting us use yur phone to find a locksmith.
needless to say a much deserved big 'plur' t-shirt is comin atcha!

peace
love
unity
repect 

to all

and to all

a happy new year!

i got there 1/2 way thru dieselboys set.  anyhow i heard he started 20 
mins late.  so i guess i only missed 10 mins.  (anyhow i got to see him 
at vibration :)  i liked sleepy-c's set, especially the last 15 minutes.  
he threw down a tune that had heavy distorted vocals, faster than the 
rest and was harder than his other stuff.  it had a burgandy looking 
label with a ferrari looking horse in the middle (if you couldn't guess, 
i'd like to get a copy of it and couldn't make out the artist!).  eric 
?????'s set was pretty cool, but not a standout.  feelgood kinda got the 
crowd going with the eurythmics/sweet dreams mixed in.  i kinda liked that!
eric davenport was alright, but i was weary from lack of sleep (which ran 
all weekend, too many good parties!)  feelgood (i think) spun the 
eurythmics "sweet dreams" which sure got a wikked reaction from the 
crowd.  some people just went duh? and the rest totally dug it!  i loved 
it!  after awhile i went and played social butterfly and left coz i hadda 
werk in the morning.  ran into stevie t from plur and darrik and the rest 
of the warren punk/rav'rs.  
....3 hrs sleep...
....11 hours of work...
...and 15 minutes of hectic fone calls...
....4 1/2 hours of driving and andy and myself made it to dayton for 
trancemission only to find that vapourspace cancelled due to a dead computer.
i was pissed that they were still charging 20$ at 2:30 especially since 
the big act wasn't there.  if i was close to home, i might have just 
turned around at this point.  after seeing union jack do their bit i was 
glad i had stayed. they had some good tunes.  tho i wonder about how much 
they played, since i did see a DAT player running on their rack setup!
ran into ed, charles and kevin of the ele mental crew and bs with tham 
for a bit.  talked to some strangers and was introduced to a few ppl.
not too bad, but could have been a better party.
 
> social butterfly 12/31/95 - lorain oh - i wasn't sure how this party was
up, didn't make this one, but instead went to vibration.  *BOOM* this one 
was da *BOMB*  too crowded and *TOO LOUD* i thought i lost 1/2 my hearing 
after i went outside!  it took about a day to get it back, yikes, i now 
will carry earplugs wherever i go!!!!  i'm not going to say much about 
this one, coz i'm shure everyone else will!  there was a great tune spun 
~7am with an air raid siren in it, very hard track, an id on it would be 
*GREAT*!!!  much suprised to run into stevie t there, as i thought he 
wasn't going!  met a few ne-rav'rs and already forgot their names !!! 
they were really cool and bs'd for awhile.....

well that's my weekend of partying before the quarter started on me....  
back to the real world...... trouty...

OK, somebody just told me that somebody pretty close to the scene in
Pittsburgh was saying that I am a drug dealer.  Worse, a K dealer.
Well, I'm not mad at all, just friggin confused.  Where in hell did
someone get that idea!? I do NOT deal drugs, at all. period.  EVER.
This is not just a cover my ass thing, all of my friends, hell anybody
in the Pittsburgh scene knows I don't deal drugs.  This is such a
ludicrous idea! I hate K, i hate crystal, i hate everything but e,
acid, and weed.  And I don't do acid, and am quitting e for the time
being.  I would never want to be a part of the destructive practices
involved in drug dealing.  Would somebody please clear my name?
Anybody?  This really sucks.  :( Anyway, Peace, Love, Unity, and
Respect aren't things a drug dealer would use to say goodbye. . . cz

Frank,
		I can vouch for you. I nearly died laughing at the 
thought of you going around saying "pssst, K, K here..."
hahaha
Frank (Count Zero) is not a drug dealer.
there, that should do it.

This did not make it to the list the first time I sent it.

First off, I'm sorry I didn't make the pre-net-meet. I was on the bus 
with about 50 other Pittsburgh nuttahs (which was a fun pre-party in is 
own right). Bigup the man like CountZero for making the bus trip possible.

Next, bigup lonnie and the rest of the Ultraworld crew!!! In my 5 years 
of partying this one takes the f*cking cake! I don't know where to begin 
but let me start w my review anyway...

Upon walking into the space I was very impressed with the lighting and 
sound in the main room. But that wasn't where I was headed. I and almost 
everyone I knew went straight to the jungle room. At first it was just 
"ok", then Soul slinger came on, I thought it would get better but the 
guy was rewinding records left and right without being asked to. I am not 
sure what we did until the next DJ was up but when he was there was a 
noticible change in atmopsphere. Up until that point people had been 
walking all around and it was pretty hard to get a groove on anyway 
things settled down a bit, the jungle room was still full to capacity but 
people actually started to dance. Around 11:55 I was expecting some one 
to play that track, 11:55, you know, the one that goes, "The time is now 
eleven fifty fiiiiiiiiive.." That would have been classic. Anyway say 
what you want about junglists being sepratists and all but at 12 midnight 
the jungle room spilled out into the main room and we ALL counted down to 
the new year TOGETHER.

I spent most of my night in the jungle room as did alot of other people. 
For those of you who never ventured inside you missed out because this is 
where the mad flavor was.It was indeed wild like a jungle, especially 
once Karl K and MC Dub2 came on, people holdin up their lighters, blowin 
their airhorns, and whistles,
not just asking for rewinds but demanding them, VIP's chuggin champagne 
back behind the DJ, Karl K himself taking a swig or two, a cloud of ganja 
smoke thick enough that you could get high just by breathing a bit, etc.  
This was a REAL jungle room like I have never seen before. Too bad 
Skinner went to LSD as he would have gotten a real schooling in jungle 
here. Anyway, all the sets were fairly good after Soul Slinger, 
especially dieselBoy's. This guy is the SMOOTHEST jungle DJ. His mixes 
that night would have put some trance dj's to shame. They were seamless. 
He stepped up to the tables with his shades and took the whole room on a 
wild trip through the jungle and we made him rewind quite a few times. MC 
Sphinx though he got off to a kinda bad start, did an absolutely 
excellent job considering that another MC kept nagging him for the Mike. 
	Now I didn't just stay in the jungle room. I ventured outside 
once for Feelgoods set which was abosultely A fucking incredible. But 
after that I needed to get back to the jungle room, the vibe was still 
flowin' and I am suprised more people from the net didn't venture inside. 
Anyway to sum up an excellent night these were the highpoints:

 1. The music - THE JUNGLE ROOM. If you missed this then you missed out! 
It was legendary!
Specifically...
dieselBoy's best set EVER! Alongside the MC Sphinx who did an excellent 
job! These guys are professionals. :)
Karl K with MC Dub2 - Just what the room needed after the "messing 
around" done by Soul Slinger.
Slant - for the absolutely chill stuff he played. This guy is slick! 
AK1200 - Never got to hear him before this and I am glad I was able to in 
this instance.

 2. The people - All the like minded junglists in there. I doubt anyone 
will ever use the weak excuse "you can't dance to jungle" ever again, 
least not in the NE. The netpeople I met (way too many to mention) 
standouts were John Speakman, Neith (I will be sending you a picture of 
your twin), the not so miserable Misery, Spike, Liz (nice seeing you 
again!), Hossam (Aka MC Sphinx), the whole entire 12B crew (you know who 
you are) and like I said before anyone I forgot, there were way to many 
to mention. Once again bigup all junglists, especially the girl
that asked to toot my whistle in the jungle room.

 3. The atmosphere - Best ever in my opinion, like I said, at 12:00 
midnight we were all together as one. 

 4. The Sound - Clear as a bell in the Jungle room, loud as hell too. My 
ears are still recovering. Sound in the main room was OK but not nearly 
as clear and pristine as the jungle room. 

 5. Lights - Eh, they were OK but my man chip from Eyegasm would have had 
those intellabeams doing some sick stuff! He creates well timed 
"explosions" of light.
 6. The Laser - Pretty good, while not full spectrum as stated, it was 
phat none the less. Can't fault Centrak. They did a great job considering 
the circumstances.

 7. The diversions - Great, I spent a little bit of time before 
dieselboy's set in the ambient room and I remmember thinking, "now this 
is an ambient room".
 Also it was good to see Raymond from Fusion there with his mixtapes. 

 8. The security - Though some people had problems I found them to be 
friendly and they didn't ask any questions when I told them the can that 
looked like a spray paint can was really a supply of compressed air for 
my air horn.

 9. The net meet inside - I wish it had been closer to the jungle room. I 
didn't get to meet nearly as many net people as I would have liked to. 
Hopefully I will get to meet some more at Mosaic (if I can get there).

10. The Bus Trip - FuN with a friggin capital F. I am so glad Frank and 
Radiance Productions could put this together. I'm glad all who went liked 
the videos. Sorry I didn't have the Tunnel Vision video though...


Overall thoughts:
This rave was a 10 out of 10 in my book. It had all the right elements. 
When people talk of "old school vibe" this was it. I can't think of a 
better way to start the new year. That was the BEST new years I've ever 
had. Thanks once again Lonnie.
My overall impression is that the production of this event was very 
professional and on par with concert production. All DJ's were announced. 
All DJ's went on at the posted times. The jungle room was the best ever. 
Groove's jungle room is a close second. Anyway I've been inspired by the 
event so much I am working on a track called "Year of the Junglist".

Well that's it. If '96 is anything like the way it started we are in for 
one absolutely excellent year.

Okay, developments time:

Tickets and Flyers:  Delays, delays, delays.  I will have the tickets on 
either Tuesday or Monday.  For those of you acting as ticket agents I 
will get you your allotment as soon as they are in hand.  Flyers should 
be in fron the printer on Tuesday and for those who emailed me I will get 
them up to you as soon as possible.  As a bit of a waffle I may offer the 
tickets at a couple of stores (611 for sure, thanks Nigel) to make them 
easier for folks to get beforehand.  Remember, you can mail order them 
from me.  I will post more info once they are in hand.

Ambient Room:  I am proud to present Karin Sedestrom, our own Ambient
Information Goddess.  She is going to help take some pressure off of me by
taking over the organization of the ambient room.  If you have questions 
re: Ambient Room send email to her.

After Hours:  Gill (Yaker), Jill and Dave G have volunteered to put on an
afterhours space at the Squash Court.  The general idea is to offer alot
of crash space with a minimalist sound system where people can grab some
z's after the gathering and before travelling out.  The space should open 
about a 1/2 hour before Mosaic ends.  Email orbital@digex.access.net for 
more information and look for further updates from the crew.

Van Trips:  So far I have two likely van trips.  Guess what?!  They are
both from the South (nudge nudge hint hint, you Northerners ;) ).  I don't
know the exact story with the Atlanta crew so I won't offer more
information on that until later.  Rob Rarousse from North Carolina will be
setting up his normal chill van trips (he sent me a little van in the mail
the other day for piloting the 'Death Star' down to Atlanta for Nextscape
:) ).  Van trips are the best folks, you get to really talk with people
and it's a sense of comraderie you can't beat.  Email me if you are
planning a trip so we can make arrangements. 

Sound Equipment:  If anyone has some DJ quality CD players please get in
touch.  I think we have pretty much met our goals for sound equipment
(whatever was not included in the sound system rental) but if you have
something you think will make the event better please feel free to 
volunteer. 

Lighting & Laser Equipment: Anybody?

So overall the Mosaic plans are going pretty well.  The delays on the
tickets and flyers aren't a problem, and all else is right with the world. 
After how incredible Vibration was I can hardly wait for this gathering to
come together (hint hint: Mosaic is walking distance from where Vibration
was).

so i bump into dj dave 'guefy' breakwell from pittsburgh @ 
VIBRATION & he gives me this mixed tape (probably out of 
guilt cuz he still owes my friend jenny $2K for his last
party).

and its actually a pretty damn good tape. given its a bad
copy & u have to turn up the volume alot, but other than
that the mixing is right on & the selection is superior 
(dave always seems to get some really good imports). i 
rate it right up there w/ TIME TO GET ILL VOL.3 with 
Scott Henry & Feelgood as my favorite current mixed tapes.

well anyways there's this house track on there that is
just so uplifting, its my favorite track on the tape.
it has that quote from that movie PULP FICTION. its 
what he sed right before he killed somebody. but then
he started to think about what he said. and he quit      
killing people.

hold on, lemme rewind the tape & write it down....

ok the quote goes like this..

'the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides'
'all sides' is echoed thru out some instrumentals

'the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides'
'for he is truly his brother's keeper and a finder of lost children'

(long electronic intermission)

'blessed is he who in the name of charity cherish the weak
 through the valley of darkness'


so can one of you know it all dj's please id this song for me.

i have a feeling it might be a white lable since they sampled
that quote from PULP FICTION & i doubt they paid for those rights.

can u tell i'm stuck at home with over two feet of snow 
surrounding my house (it don't get much further north than
cleveland & we're by the lake too!)

wow, i m impressed there r people out there that know their music.
much thanx to: gil, countzero, peter, kenji, dirceau, & ronPS for
yur responses for my song id.

its good to know that some people are HEARING the music.     

ironic side note the song  wuz id'ed to be EZEKIEL 25:17.
but if u look up EZEKIEL 25:17 in the bible (which i had to
borrow since i'm not religious), it reads:

'And I will execute great vengence upon them with furious rebukes;
 and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my 
 vengence upon them.'

altho that is the last part of the quote from PULP FICTION.
it is not the passage that is sampled in the actual song:

'the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides'
'for he is truly his brothers keeper & a finder of lost souls'
'blessed is he who in the name of charity & goodwill,                
 cherish the weak through the valley of darkness.'

Supposively going to be a weekly thing, too.  

Comparing last week's "Gravity" party at the Strip Bar to previous summer 
public and private events held there, I can say one thing-  don't exect 
much dancing room!

Actually, that part of the quote is also in the song.  Perhaps
they mix it out too soon or mix it in too late to get that part,
but it's there.  Fer sure.  Words ever so slightly different,
but damn there's so many translations of the bible.

I'm glad to see all the posts for parties coming up... so now that we're 
seeing them every once and a while, does someone want to compile a ROM 
for us?  It should be someone who is pretty invovled with the pb and 
cle/ohio scenes who can put it together weekly and post it on the same 
day each week.

any takers?

mailing every week.  comments?  suggestions?  criticisms?  money?  :)

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkII
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

This is my first whack at the R0M and i put in what i know of.  I will 
watch pb-cle raves and mw-raves, but will need submissions in some form 
that are not on the lists.  this will only work with a little help!  

Tom Butcher would like to see weekly club events listed and i would like 
to see some radio programs listed as well.  i dont have info on radio 
stations, since my radio can't pick up much here in youngstown :(  107.9 
(the trend) and 106.7 are about it for out of town radio and they are 
both mtv-alterna-knock-offs so i dont give them much of a listen...  its 
the local oldies station (93.3 wbbg-oldies 93) for me!  

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Submissions to: s0176326@cc.ysu.edu (preferred) or
                jffocht@cis.ysu.edu (i don't check this one often!)

is the thing at the Strip Bar Cafe tomorrow night still on?  w/all the
snow and stuff, i was wondering...
well heck, maybe i'll just call down there...i'll let you all know (if
no one responds to this post first)

p.s. how many of you have had to explain to your friends that this
"Strip Bar" you talk about is _just_ a cafe?

OK, i'm going to try this again...

If you have a pb-cle-raves related webpage or a homepage of your own, 
send me the URL and I'll post it to the pb-cle-raves webpage.  I'm mostly 
interested in webpages from promoters, DJs, and musicians in the area, 
but anything you want to send would be great.

I tried this before, but only 2 people replied... and having a links page 
with just two links would look pathetic.  :)

i am VERY optimistic about what's been happening in columbus over the 
last couple months.  the scene has broken itself down, and built itself 
back up.  not without a lot of sweat and headaches, but i really thing 
people are starting to get a sense about what is possible in our little 
subculture.

i mean, to most people a party is still just a party and that "vibe" is 
still not carried out too well into the daytime world, but to feel the 
TREMENDOUS energy i felt at the two parties we threw this weekend, i am 
very optimistic that that energy can be channeled towards something 
absolutely amazing.

i'll just have to leave it at that for now...but does anyone else have any 
thoughts about their scenes?  what are we becoming and how do we get to 
the next phase if we indeed feel we must go higher?

as for us, some of you know what the answer is...more free or cheap 
events, performances, music you've never heard, visuals you've never 
seen before, and so on...

the liberation of sound continues...

Yes, they are out!  I got in a batch of 492 tickets at the end of last
week.  I have been trying to hold off on announcing so that I can get the
local distribution network set up to make purchases easier on everyone. 
But, I will just follow that up in a few days once it is all set and
settled.  For right now the tickets are available only through me via mail
order but will be available later through your friendly local netters. 

Ticket cost is $8, please send a check or money order payable to Daniel 
Philpott to:

Dan Philpott
8015 Mandan Rd. #102
Greenbelt, MD  20770

Tickets will be sent out in a batch at each weeks end via regular post.  
One week prior to the party I will suspend mail order purchases and 
tickets will be available either through local netters or at the door.

It is not required that you send postage for your tickets, but I can
process the tickets faster if you send a Self Addressed Stamped Envelope. 

BTW, HUMUNGOUS props to Derrick Miller for these fantastic tickets.  I
really like how they turned out. 

Dan

Ps. Due to illness and snow storms the flyers are delayed until the end 
of this week.  As soon as they hit my hands they will be repackaged and 
sent out to those who requested them.  Hope you are feeling better, Jason.

Subject: columbus party on 1-14
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I saw ed's post that mentioned the two free parties in columbus last weekend
and i just wanted to add my own mini review of the second party of the set.

I had no intention of going to either of these parties, actually i had
planned on going to chicago on sunday, but at about 11pm me and a bunch of
other cleveland kids jumped in my car and turned on the radar detector.  A
few hours later i woke up from a nice nap to find us in columbus.  The party
was in the basement of an apartment building(or at least that what i think it
was :) )  After making my way through crowds and dark hallways i entered the
main room to solid people.  There were so many people there that it was
nearly impossible to enter the main room, and the party was so good that no
one wanted to leave that room. 

The music was great.  Unfortunately i can not recite the specifics of how
each dj blew me away because i really just didn't know who was spinning when,
and everyone i asked knew as little as myself.  Some highlights for me were:
one dj threw "prepare to flash" into his set around 4am and got the whole
place pulsing with a huge phat base, not a soul sat that one out.  Hum, its
been a couple days since the party, and i am suffering from severe sleep
deprivation... so i just can't seem to think of what i can say without
knowing who each dj was.  Every set was huge.  

I will humbly admit that i am one of those people that just doesn't find
herself dancing to jungle, but a couple of guys got up that night and spun
jungle in their sets that even i couldn't hold back from.  I had thought the
party was going to be strictly jungle, but to my surprise and delight there
was an examplory combination of all different types of dance music.  

Everyone there was lost in this wild vibe.  If anything, the one thing that i
felt was in the least unappealing to me personally about the party was the
feeling that the people there all knew each other very well and at first a
lot of people were merely standing around talking only to their friends.  But
once the vibe had taken everyone into the music, everyone was smiling at
everyone else, talking to perfect stangers, fun stuff like that.  So, really
i can't complain at all, the party was great!  It was unfortunate however
that people kept tripping over the cords and turning off the system, each
time that happened it was disappointing - but it was also gave people a
chance to stop dancing and look around and experience the vibe that had been
created in that small basement room that was literally dripping from all the
ice and snow melting outside.  

I used to go to parties and lose control of my body for hours, i would dance
from the moment i got there till i colapsed about 7 hours later and went
home.  I haven't done that in a while, (mostly due to my crappy physical
shape) but last sunday i just couldn't hold back.  I danced and i danced,
then i found some water and danced some more.  It was a great party.  Its
nice to see a party that was not some huge financial investment decorated
with extravagent light shows and expensive locations, turn out just as phat.

so my point is - i am glad i ended up in columbus on sunday night, it was
most definitely worth the drive!  Ill be watching for any upcoming columbus
events!

lots of luv
leah

Some more information on the tickets.  First, tickets will be available at
the door.  I know alot of people are travelling for this and I don't want
to have people show up and not be able to get in.  I prefer that people
get tickets before hand as it means we can get more done before the party
(travel expenses, party necessities, more stuff at the gathering). 
Second, tickets and flyers will be sent out to the local sellersin the
middle of next week.  Jason/Method1 is handling the mailing.  Here is a
short and incomplete list of who is handling tickets in various areas: 

Boston:			Neith
Upstate NY:		Phat-O
Upstate NY/Roving:	SarahS
New York City:		John Speakman
Philadelphia:		Nigel Richards/611 Records
Baltimore/Roving:	Spike
DC/Baltimore/Via Mail:	danFREELove
Richmond:		Jason/Method1
North Carolina:		Rob Rarousse
Atlanta:		Mike Polmah

I will post a complete list (with contact info) as soon as I am done
contacting and arranging things.  This is a preliminary list, I have about
3 other people I waiting on.  Also, van trip organizers will have tickets
available. 

I am also looking for someone who can do a tea/water/smart drink/soda 
bar at reasonable prices.  Water is available in the bathrooms, but I 
cant really afford to prepurchase all the supplies necessary.

Dan

well, here's another R0M for your viewing pleasure.... Thanks to 
Shoryuken!, ed luna, Count Zero, and Farmer Tea for giving info for the 
calendar.  ummm, where's cleveland at?  should we change this to the 
pitt-columbus R0M?  anyhow, if you know of an event, radio show, or 
weekly event (ed, does mekka still have a weekly thing?) let me know 
(especially you cleveland folks!)  anyhow, without further adieu....

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I

*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can

ack, just when i wanted to retire...

ok, welp since i wuz s'posed to do the bus trip from 
cleveland for CYBERTRIBE & that never happened & since i've
done a few rental van trips from cleveland to just about 
every other city that had a decent party & since i'm
such a big net raver & since a few pb-cle & mw net ravers
have been buggin me about it, i'm thinking about organizing
a caravan/bus/van trip to MOSAIC.

hey star (my beloved chicago distributor), do u & kate
(my right hand girl) & lucy wanna gather up the chicago
vrave posse. make a trek out to cleveland, where me &
the rest of the cleveland crew (most probably jeff/stuff,
& greta/sugarbear since they were the ones who were askin
me about it, maybe eric from oberlin, troutsoup from
youngstown & a few of my ravah buds from the 216). will team
up w/ u guys. we'll all jump into a rental van or caravan
down to columbus to pick up a few net ravahs down there
(most definitely allroy cuz he's such a bork & the vrave
king, liz, & my girly girl leidra - ohio dancer represent 
maybe jenny & whoever else wants to represent from the
614). and from there it's baltimore or bust.

oh btw it's in lonnie's warehouse. so if u went to VIBRATION,
u know where it's at. i'm all too familiar with it especially
being stuck in it w/ my last trek there, right allroy? 

e-me if yur interested, so we can do this thing...

Hey pb-cle-raves:
Since I'm on co-op this semester, there was no way I could continue my
Friday afternoon show. However, my show has moved to Sunday night 
(what some would call Monday morning) from midnight 'til two a.m.  Also, my
preferred e-mail address has changed.  You can reach me at sdh7@wired.jolt.com.

is there anyone on this list that likes happy hardcore?
is there anyone on this list who wishes it was played more?
is there any dj's on this list who would consider playing a 
                happy hardcore set instead of the usual?

the lack of happy hardcore around here reall saddens me!
i need my happy hardcore, and is phoenix the only one capable
of providing it?  
i think not...

feedback.

love,
ryu

did i hear someone say hardcore!!!

i LUV hardcore!  no offense to all the jungle fans out there but this little
dancer luvs to hear hardcore at parties.  I mean, over time i have learned to
dance to jungle, and i have always appreciated listening to jungle, but its
not the same.  

If people want to play more hardcore at parties they would hear nothing but
support from me!

luv

No, Pebbles the type of hardcore that Ryu was talking was "Happy 
Hardcore", which is not "hardcore" techno, rather is it more piano-driven 
and house/jazz driven breakbeats.   

I think the hardcore you are thinking of is hardcore *techno* or 
hardtrance... (which is what I dig also...)

And as far as happy hardcore djs on the net go, DJ Casper from Boston can 
be located at jcarow@mit.edu (his name is julian) and will more then 
likely be able to fix you up with a tape...

By happy hardcore, do you mean oldschool type breakbeat stuff?  I'd love 
to play a set of that sometime.  I think I'd rather make it a surprise 
though so it catches people off-guard.  :)

	I think Kevy-Kev is about the best breakbeat dj I know...and I 
can't stand the stuff!

     happy hardcore is kinda old schoolish, but rather new.
for anyone who is curious, hh is sort of a cross between jungle
and gabber.  don't let the "g" word scare you off though.
it's not simple-minded 4x4.  happy hardcore combines 170bpm+
breakbeats (all chopped up), sub bass, gorgeous piano riffs, 
lush strings, and chirpie vocals (usually female), all driven by
a 4/4 kick drum.  pure energy!  
     it is remenisent of old school because it uses some similar synth
sounds and it is packed with the original feeling of ecstacy.
this is a sound that is not worried about impressing competition,
just having fun and uplifting your spirit.
     unfortunately it isn't very popular here (or anywhere in the U.S.)
because people take a negative attitude towards it before they ever 
give it a chance.  
     oh, one more thing...it's cheesey as all hell!!!!!!!!!

if anyone is curious, i'd be more than happy to supply you a tape.
thanx for reading...

love,
ryu

always puts me in some sort of trance and i always find it hard to get up and
dance to it, but when i do - i have so much fun! so...

here we go!  thanks out to stevie t for the cleveland info!
totally not related to this (well actually it is): does anyone have a 
15-17" flatscreen, multisync'ing monitor for sale as this one here is 
dying a slow and painful (to look at) death??  

someone mentioned a .net.meet at jungle warfare?  look for me with my 
mw-raves tag on....  trouty....

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  i just did a quickie there for now, coz i'm lazy.  there is also 
   a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if you have an 
   info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

there's a thread on midwest `bout why people got into "raving," here's my 
response.  it's super-long but i thought some of you might get a chuckle 
out of a couple old cleveland parties i mention ;)

To: mwraves <mw-raves@taz.hyperreal.com>
Subject: a history of sorts...

(subtitled: WHY I RAVE *snicker*)

well like a lot of people my age (mid-20s) i got into techno via the 
industrial route.  MEAT BEAT and 808 did it for me, as well as the more 
ambient stuff of SWANS, THE CRANES, COCTEAU TWINS, etc all that 
lush-sounding 4A.D. stuff...

now at that time, anywhere from 1989-1992, techno was not really split 
into too many categories...MEAT BEAT, YOUNG GODS, LFO, and ERASURE could 
often be found in the same section at the record store, for example...
"techno" covered a lot of ground, from industrial to house to ambient.
but the differentiation which has taken place since (jungle/hardcore/
acid/trax/trip-hop etc) is misleading, because even then, most of today's 
categories did exist (if unnamed and undeveloped).  acid jazz/trip hop 
originally existed in the `70s, played on real instruments...of course 
then it was called "soul" or "free jazz" or "instrumental funk."
electro, or "breakdance music" was often called "techno" and just as 
often not even differentiated from hip hop.  acid and acid house existed 
as early as 1986 (probably earlier, going back to disco!), but it was 
slower, and only a few people in chicago and other big city-clubs even knew 
about it.  jungle existed, but it was a lot poppier and was called "break 
beat" or "hip house" (and it was often slow enough to even be mixed with 
house!).   really hard industrial dance stuff existed, verging on 
gabber.  etc. 

(ok, enough of that shit)

i appreciated the more electronic side of things, and saw the difference 
between what was the house-culture influence of bands like DEE-LITE, as 
opposed to the teutonic-influenced NITZER EBB, for example, but i liked 
it all, even though my real exposure to the origins of those musics (on 
the one hand, club culture, and on the other, punk/industrial culture) was 
limited by where i am...columbus ohio.  not too clubby or punky here :)

in late 1991 i met titonton duvante, who was doing music with a band 
called BODY RELEASE.  later i found out that an old industrial mate named 
charles noel was also with the band (todd sines and mike szebczek were 
the other two band members).  BODY RELEASE sounded like a crossbreeding 
of LFO, old-skool breakbeat (esp REINFORCED), and house.  i saw them play 
a couple times, liked them somewhat, but then i realized electronic 
music, and especially techno,  was getting too "busy" for my taste.
  
my turnoff point:  in summer of 1992, i heard a song called "there is no 
law" and i just couldn't handle it.  it was too fast, crazy, changed too 
much, and i knew i just wasn't ready for it.  so i thought i was "over" 
techno and basically pulled out of what little scene there was for that 
kind of music, and went back to rock 'n' roll.  (ok, ok, so sue me)

at the same time, however, i worked with titonton on some new-agey 
type of music, playfully called DISCO BREAD, with me on guitar and him on 
keyboard, which we didnt take very seriously (especially with a name like 
THAT! :).  

but just from being over at that house (where the whole B/RE cru lived), i 
soaked up a lot of information which i had never really put together 
before.  i saw the lineages through which techno could be traced:

titonton was into early breaks and especially new classical stuff like 
MEREDITH MONK, PHILIP GLASS, and TERRY RILEY.  charles came into techno 
through hip hop and house...and he never understood that what was so 
obvious to him (that house was a "black" thing to a great degree) was 
totally misunderstood by his own black culture (now, it's the opposite...
the white kids don't realize how black techno is ;).  todd was the one i 
most related to musically; he listened to a lot of "intelligent" 
industrial such as early P.I.L., COIL, etc...

it made just as much sense to approach techno from titonton's minimal 
classical stuff as it did through hip hop as it did through industrial 
(of course i only really realized all of this JUST NOW AS I'M WRITING IT ;).

and they were _always_ playing breakbeat!  especially off the REINFORCED 
label, and little by little i realized that that stuff had some of the 
same avant-garde flavor that i so admired in the dark music of the 
SWANS, THIS MORTAL COIL, etc...which i had been really into.  the 
beat-cutting really woke me up because here was a music that was really 
taking sampling into new realms, like no other music (STILL) has really 
done.  also, APHEX TWIN and SOURCE, which todd was playing a lot, 
led me to a deeper understanding of the lushness and beauty which techno 
could be capable of...

now, as far as "raves" go i really didnt understand what the big deal 
was.  it just seemed like another name for an afterhours.  so when todd 
handed me a flyer for RAVIN BRAN in november 1992, in cleveland (where BODY 
RELEASE was playing), i just laughed and said "it's not worth driving up to 
cleveland for _that_."

in early 1993 the B/RE cru threw a house party and i showed some nasty old
stag films on the ceiling.  the djs sucked but the party was still great
because no real dj culture had really developed in columbus, outside of 
the clubs.  so to hear everyone just faking it was a real great time (all  
except charles, who had been spinning hip hop since he was like 13).  i 
still didn't feel like i could "stoop" to the level of techno again, 
"it's a fad," i thought.  but then i heard 2 songs that really changed my 
perspective: "zig zag" and "percolator."  dude, this was _music_.  these 
were minimal little dittys with jazz clips and truly innovative sounds...
and man, i was hooked.  little by little i started "getting" it, i kept 
finding more and more songs that i "understood."  then i understood that 
the point of some techno IS to be totally obtuse and relentlessly 
repetitve; in fact the whole traxx/trance thing really started getting 
to me.  and then all that "busy" stuff, embodied by the new spirit of 
breakbeat, which at first had almost literally scared me away from 
techno (!), also made sense.  i loved it!

but my first "real" rave wasn't until march of 1993, called FELICITY'S 
BLISS in cleveland.  the only reason i went was because i was starting to do 
visuals for BODY RELEASE, showing silly films and such.  it was a 
terrible party but interestingly, a band called BIG ENGINE played (2 
members of which are now in the ele mental posse: stephen/kingSize and 
rich/ihannoa).  if i recall correctly, i really didn't get much into 
raving at all, except as the visual guy.  the first party i think i went 
to just for the fun of it was CRYSTAL'S BIRTHDAY in dayton (gee, anyone 
remember THAT chestnut?).  (on second thought i think i did some visuals 
for that party, but oh who cares)

anyway, to move along here, i got into event-throwing soon after.  basically
this sculptor dude wanted us to use his space for a party and of course i 
saw it as a cool opportunity to make it a lot more artsy-fartsy than the 
silly parties i had already been to, but the sculptor dude went to a 
cheesy rave in town and said "uh, never mind."  we said, "fuck it" and so 
todd found a parking garage and we threw our first party (where we got 
our name): ELE MENTAL, in may of 1993.  dieselboy and a couple club djs 
spun, as well as titonton (who still didnt know how to spin) and charles...
it was a great time.  then we did a little bigger one called COMFORT in 
the summer of 1993, which turned out pretty nice (over 500 ppl came!), 
but then shortly thereafter, something happened.

the scene died.  

for months, it seemed that parties were barely happening.  was the "fad" 
over? (well of course you know the answer)

then BODY RELEASE broke up...everyone was doing their own thing and it was 
just no use trying to squeeze it all into one band.  and altho the 
breakup was a positive one with lots of promise, the state of the scene 
raised serious questions about what might happen to techno...in other 
words, was it worth it?

then THE VIBE IS ON happened in dayton in september of 1993, and it seemed 
like a culmination of sorts...an amazing party to end an era. 

i often reflect on the significance of that moment where we all 
thought, here in columbus at least, that the scene was dead.  what were 
we to do?  titonton and i, at least, used to have conversations like 
"what will breaks sound like in 10 years?"  the answer was unspeakable; 
we just _couldn't_ imagine it (the last 3 years have certainly born 
_that_ out, as jungle has gotten more and more out there...).  but it was 
our own curiosity, our own need to find out what would happen, that 
forced us to keep hope.

in december 1993, i spearheaded an event (for the first time), called 
SNOW*BALL (named by titonton).  it was my own attempt to get ele mental 
back involved in the process...our statement to the world that we were 
here to STAY, at least long enough to find out where music was going to 
go, and with or without a "scene."  the scene picked up bigtime soon 
after SNOW*BALL, and hasn't stopped since...in fact it's gotten bigger, 
more diverse, and more uncontrollable.  ravers, more than ever, do NOT 
share a common experience, as there are too many parties in too many 
places on the same night.

partially because of this, ele mental did not do a big event in 1994 at all.
we did house parties and helped jj in kentucky a couple times, etc...but 
it just seemed like doing a party wasn't the same with so much going on.
we also thought that with such a glut of events, and such an influx of the 
drug culture, that very few of these "ravers" could ever care about the 
things we cared (care) about.

but we kept our faith, ultimately, through the smaller stuff, and because 
we saw what was going on in other cities.  detroit was instrumental in 
this...especially dat and his POORBOY parties...i mean, if people in such a 
FUCKED UP CITY could do it, then why not us?  the ILLUMINATORS also 
opened the doors for us, letting us spin and involving us in the 
process...coz they understood what was up, too (even tho they have yet to 
do a "weird" event ;).  charles put out a couple tape compilations of 
columbus music called FUSION, which was yet another important statement: 
that columbus has MUSIC GOING ON and that you got to reco'nize, foo'...

by luck of circumstance and finding a couple usable spaces, ele mental 
hit the big time in 1995 with kevin/placebo's MINIMAL STATE, me and aum with 
MANTRA, and doughboy's RED TEMPEST.  charles released his own slab o 
vinyl.  todd had something released on peace frog.  more FUSION comps. 
so shit was starting to happen!

but as far as the events go, again, they were ultimately unsatisfying...
and _incredibly_ stressful.  i tried to dig deeper at an untitled event 
on jun 30 but was hit so hard that i, for one, felt that the scene could 
not support the deeper kind of event i had in mind.

now, the last 6 months have been the best we've had.  why?  we went 
smaller.  we dug deeper.  from august until last week, we've done almost 
_10_ free house parties, concerts, or small events.  and we've all 
had a hell of a lot more fun doing them and being involved in them.
less stress, less expectation, and also...more people have been getting 
the message and thanking us for it.  also, more music has come out:  2 
more by todd, one more by charles (self-released), and one by titonton 
(which people seem to especially like)...and an ambient tape compilation 
called TEXT 1 which i compiled...

so what's the point of all of this?  well, right now the scene (or the more 
appropriate phrase, "scene_S_") is at an all-time peak.  you have all kinds 
of parties: house parties, small parties, big raves, and mega-corporate 
raves.  we have a situation where the "consumers" outnumber the 
"appreciators."  in other words more people are going to parties for 
reasons related to consumption: drugs, alcohol (in some cities), 
"prestige," to "fit in," or by pure accident.  

now i'm not saying this is exclusively bad, but it is harder for people 
in today's scene to really appreciate the true nature of the scene, or 
rather the deeper shit which i would say has to do with the music, djs, 
ppl that make the music, technology, visuals, the tribal gathering 
thing, self-discovery THRU drugs, and most especially: the grass-roots 
nature of the whole process.  it is hard for "consumers" to appreciate 
these things when it is so easy for them to take the scene for granted.  

"there's always another party" is a typical attitude.  well in mid-1993, 
the scene almost did die, let me tell you.  (and in some ways it is 
always in danger of dying...)

very few of the "consumers" are asking themselves just those questions 
that may lead them towards this deeper understanding, such as: "why am i a 
`raver'?" "who am i?" "what is _really_ going on here?"  and VERY FEW 
promoters are making that extra effort towards providing an environment 
where this kind of dialogue and self-reflection can take place.

my involvement in ele mental--as the loudest voice on the net and 
sometimes otherwise, as an event-thrower/designer, as a webpage designer, 
as a "raver" just out to have a great time--has been a slow but steady 
process of coming closer and closer to that understanding: the 
understanding of my (admittedly self-appointed) responsibility to try new 
ways of making this environment of self-discovery possible.  

THAT's what the events that i have spearheaded are all about.  i'd say 
even the ones that weren't/aren't by me (such as MINIMAL STATE and RED 
TEMPEST, and GENERATOR coming up this april) have had/will have some of this 
aesthetic in mind.

THAT's why i rave.  THAT's why i throw events.  THAT's why i post.  
THAT's why i did the webpages, for ele mental as well as mw-raves.
to be an example of someone who loves the music and the scene so much
that i'm willing to put my money and time where my mouth is.  to do what 
i can to encourage that self-reflection, and not all the shadiness, 
frivolity, and excess of many other events/crus.  and to give props where 
props are due...to the promoters, musicians, djs, and the people and history 
that has gotten us here...

do i expect a big smooch?  hell no...all i really want is for you, yes i 
mean YOU reading this right now, to ask yourself those deeper questions...
and find your own answers.  ele mental is not about preaching, it's 
about living by example.  sometimes i do feel i have to preach and bitch 
and moan just to be heard, but so be it (maybe that's wrong, but 
sometimes i think it is necessary).

so there you have it.

and that, my net homeys, is what SNOW*FALL is all about.  it's part 2 of 
SNOW*BALL, our appropriately-named party at the true beginning of our 
long road towards...ourselves.

one more thing:  i hate to turn this into a whole promo for the event, 
but SNOW*FALL is truly a collaboration between us all.  several of us are 
putting up the necessary funds to get this all together, and almost all 
the people you see on the flyer or on the net post are PLAYING FOR FREE.
that's right.  todd sines and stephen/kingSize are playing for NOTHING, 
titonton, charles/monochrome, chris, placebo, doughboy, etc etc etc.
and even the detroit cru which are our guests (shake, paris, billeebob, 
brian gillespie) are doing it for next-to-nothing because THEY 
understand, and in fact it was them who helped US through the downtime.  
we both owe each other a lot.  and obviously this means that the people 
throwing it aren't making a dime...and if we do (an unlikely scenario), 
well, it's "payment" for doing all of this for free.
 
so there.  that's what my "rave" experience has been all about.

i hope to see you here on fri, feb 2.  :P

and thanks if you read this far, yer a real trooper if ya did ;) 

(more later)

so did u stop liking techno just because of ONE SONG? no offence, but
that sounds kind of weird 2 me. like 1 techno song isn't
representational of all the others is it? by the way, all that history

---------------------- Directions to Jungle Warfare!!!! -----------------

>From Erie, Upstate New York and All Points NORTH.

Take I-79 South to I-279 South. Take 279 South to Pittsburgh and continue 
till you see the Oakland/Monroeville 376 Exit.
Take 376 East past the Squirell Hill exit to the VERY NEXT EXIT. Get off 
at the Monroeville exit and follow the "You're Getting Damn Close" 
directions below.

>From West Virginia and All Points Due SOUTH.

Take I-79 North to 376 East. Take 376 East past the Squirell Hill Exit to 
the VERY NEXT EXIT. Get off at the Monroeville exit and follow the 
"You're Getting Damn Close" directions below.

>From DC, Baltimore, Virgina and All points SOUTH-EAST.

>From Baltimore -

Take I-70 to Breezwood. Take I-76 West to 376 West. Get Off at the 
Monroeville exit and follow the "You're Getting Damn Close" directions below.

>From DC - Take 270 to I-70 East and then Follow Baltimore Directions


>From New York, Allentown, Harrisburg and Due EAST.

Take I-78 West to I-81 and then Take I-76 West to 376 West. Take 376 West 
to the Monroeville exit. Follow the "You're Getting Damn Close" directions.


>From Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown and all points WEST.

Take the Ohio Turnpike to I-76 East to 376 East. Take 376 East past the 
Squirell Hill exit and get off at the VERY NEXT EXIT. After you have 
taken the Monroeville exit I command you to follow the "You're Getting 
Damn Close" directions below.


	      	    You're Getting Really Damn Close

	Now that you have exited 376 you should be on Rt 22 going towards
Monroeville. Look for a strip mall with a place called Kongs in it. Which
side its on depends on where you got off 376 and what direction you were
comming from. If you were comming from the west then it will be on your
LEFT. If you were comming from the East then it should be on your RIGHT. 
If you are unsure which direction you came from check both sides but if
you are driving keep your eyes on the road. The venue is a place called
Kongs if you haven't guessed it by now. If you get lost (YOU SHOULDN'T)
call the UDG infoline @ 412.734.1467 the directions will be on there as
well. 

Thats about it. 

Some notes: I-76 is also called the Pennsylvania Turnpike
	    The speed limit on it is 65 MPH
	    If you like to speed then watch out for the smokeys especially 
	    around Breezewood and Somerset. 
	    If you get lost near the site ask the someone where Kongs is. 
 	    If they're a local they'll know.
	    Frank Glazer (Count Zero) is organizing a net meet.
See you there!

to anyone who wants a few flyers for SNOW*FALL, ele mental's next little 
event on fri 2 feb 96 in columbus ohio.

i promise they look cool, they are small and politically correct, and 
have a great design sense (by resident graphic designer mcjones).  i mean 
that.

even if you don't plan on coming, i am willing to send you a couple!
just send me your snail-mail address and you should get em within the week.

why am i doing this?  well, partially i don't want anyone to have an 
excuse to say "i didnt know about it."  but mostly, i am trying to prove 
that we're trying to do something DIFFERENT with our events.  so if you're 
with us, then i'm willing to front the postage.  this goes hand in hand 
with my personal history post...if you read that then you shouldn't be 
surprised by this...

(that's it...no preaching, whining, or "defending" the columbus scene! 
woo woo! ;)

Hey all you hip netters out there.  I'm just posting to say that there
will be a NET MEET at Jungle Warfare.  1:30 AM at the water station.
Considering this event is being held in a club, this will probably be
a bar type setup.  SO, I can't wait to see all you net folk on Sunday
morning! :) Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect, Count Zer0

With much saddness, one North-Side/Schenley High Posse was unable to 
attend Jungle Warfare because of the treacherous icy conditions. :( That 
and the fact that it's a parental's car.  I mean - why did it have to be 
like this, is mother nature against us?  Did the party go off as 
planned?  If you went how was it?  This was one event I was really 
looking forward too.  Somehow I've missed deseilboy's sets for a  about 3 
consecutive partys, and pretty much our whole posse was wanting to hear 
187's set...well, if anyone can give me a low-down on the hoe-down, I'd 
be much appriciative ;)...

i like chicago, its a nice place and its not too long of a drive from cle
(well, its long, but its not incredible)

HOME was great - all the music i heard was good, unfortunately i never saw a
flier or a lineup, so im ashamed to say i can't really relay any specific
reviews of djs.  There were two rooms going and i only looked in one briefly,
i spent most of my time in the other room, the main room.  All of the music
had that nice phat bass, lots of people were dancing, i even heard a few
whistles... there were a lot of people there!  Unfortunately i didn't really
meet any chicago ravers, but i ran into a bunch of old random faces.  

i should say more - it really was a great party and this review doesn't
really say much, but im tired so... :) 

Yesturday was just one of those freak days for me.  First, leaving cleveland
proved to be very difficult, we had planned on leaving around 4pm and meeting
up with some friends in chicago - but we didn't leave till 7pm and everything
was just unplanned and up in the air.  On the highway on the way there the
little side headlight on the left hand side of my car spontaneously propelled
itself out of its socket.  I couldn't figure out what had happened, i didnt
hit anything or do anything, the light just popped right out and simply
disconnected from my car.  Now i have a hole where it should be.  That really
freaked me out... but anyway. Once we got to chicago we still didn't have
directions, so we just got off at an exit, turns out it was exactly the right
one.  We had messed up our communications with our friends in chicago, so we
weren't really sure about how we were going to meet them or if they were even
going ... but as we were walking accross the street from the parking lot to
the party, so were they! Then due to some personal commitments i had to leave
sorta early (around 5am) so i left the party to walk outside to my car which
i discovered to be completely surrounded in other cars.  Needless to say i
had to wait around for about 2 hours to get my car out of the lot.  I must
say, if there was anything to complain about HOME, it was that i paid $$ to
park, and then the people in charge of parking did such a crap job that 3/4
of the people at the party were blocked into one lot or another.  That was a
pain. Im sorta upset that thats how i had to end that party, b/c even though
i got to stay a few hours longer than i had planned, i didn't even enjoy
myself for those two hours, all i did was run around trying to figure out how
to get my car out of that lot.  Oh well.  It was a really good party, ill
have to start going to chicago parties more often!  10 hours driving is a lot
though, really it was more than that too.  And now my car has a hole in it.
 It looks sorta funny, like something out of starwars: you know the way it
would look if C3P0 got his arm ripped off, a hole with little wires and stuff
hanging out, thats what my is like. (sorta) :)

how was jungle warfare? and how was Extreme? 

luv
leah

Tickets are available in three ways:  from local netters, via mail (that's

well, I just woke up from a long weekend travelling throughout western
Penn to get to Jungle Warfare and despite a few shortcomings I thought it
was worth it. I drove down with Kittyn to the club in Monroeville late
Saturday night and the roads were SOLID ICE. Once we even ran straight
into the median. Once we got to the club, which was called Kong's and
decorated with vines, flourescent birds and other jungle stuff, I found
sarahs and crisbee and went out on the dance floor...
As far as the music goes, I didn't hear Starchild or most of Sine but what
I heard of sine was good stuff ( albeit predetermined I think ). After
Sine was Ruffian who spun some pretty good hardstep building up to dieselboy.
Despite a bad mic for dub and so-so sound all around ( no sub-woofers at
all), damians set took the house down.. He played several songs which
absolutely blew my mind. He chose most of his stuff based on the energy of
the packed house and had to play 3 reeeewiiiinds during the course of his
set...big ups to all the djs for a phat party.
As far as I know this was the largest all-jungle party this side of the
atlantic ( including Chi-town ). So Underground Inc has something to brag
about.. But I sensed that jungle is starting to be accepted all around
much more and as a dedicated junglist that makes me all oogly inside...
]I'm already psyched for the plethora ( SAT word ) of jungle parties and
jungle lineups ( including the almighty grooverider ) coming up this
spring.. 
Also, special thanx to Crisbee and Adrienne for crash space and overall
hospitality..thanx to countzero for helping me find someplace to hang out
Friday in State College.. thanx to Joe LeSesne(1.8.7 )for a phat live set
and letting me play on his ASR-10 ( I WANT one )...and thankx to the Pitt
jungle massive for a phat party ( next time stay out for a little while
AFTER dieselboys set :p ).. thankx all around..
Love and Hugz...
Lil' J/Pooky

hmm, where to begin?  firstoff, joe's and the info lines directions were 
vague if not wrong.  everyone i talked to agreed (sorry guys)  ...  i 
managed to find it coz i had a hunch it was near the monroeville mall, 
sho'nuff it was!  first i went in and found noah in his big blue 
cat-in-the-hat hat and we went to the water-bar for the 1:30 net meet and 
found noone :(  anyhow, went around looking at the jungle decorations in 
the bar and was amused by the paintings of all the lions and stuff 
around.  most appropriate!  i listened to dieselboys set and thought it 
was pretty cool, but i didn't dance, coz well i dont dance.  i missed 
karl k's set coz i was bs'ing with a few net.ravers (frank, noah, kevin, 
and that girl from ne-raves that i forgot her name, sarahs)  i bought a few 
rekkids and went out into the much cold air to stick them into my car.  
*brrrr*  1.8.7 did a nice smoov set, and my friends from youngstown kept 
asking how one guy does all that!  yeah, i was suprised that ~ 7 ppl came 
down from youngstown that i didn't know were coming.  i'm sad because i 
drove down by myself coz andy and darrik backed out.  and the worst is 
they're my neighbors!  talk about your lack of communication!  after 
1.8.7 i hadda leave as i had to work in the morning :(  ....   i had no

ok the "What is a rave" archive is coming along at a slow but steady pace...
:)...but now I do have a little more idea of where I want to go with it and
was hoping some of you out in "net raver"land could help out a little bit
:). ok really quick I'm just gonna post 4 questions that I would like to
answer on the archive and would like your answers to any/all of them :)..as
before it cna be one sentence or 5 pages....anything would be great :)...so
anyway here's the questions:

1.    What is a rave? 
2.    Where/How did "raving" start? 
3.    What's so great about raving? 
4.    Why all the bad press? 

and as always please reply in private e-mail....thank you :)

Smile

  SKYLAB2000 PRESS RELEASE FOR JANUARY 1996

  First, massive thanks to URB magazine for all the attention they've given us
  lately. This month we are in publisher/DJ Raymond Roker's top ten charts, 
  there's plenty of random chit-chat about our recent live performances, and 
  even a glowing review of the new Skylab2000 single. Much thanks!

  We are also happy to announce our new web site at
  http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/brainforest

  For those of you who are unfamiliar with us:
  
  Skylab2000 is a trance/acid band based in Los Angeles, CA. In the last few
  years we have performed everywhere from small underground parties to huge
  rave events. A series of live performances, such as the "One Roof" party
  with Frankie Bones, helped Skylab2000 earn great respect in the west coast
  underground. A chain of massive shows - "Circa '94", at the Shrine
  Auditorium in Los Angeles and two years of "Playscool" at the San Diego
  Sports Arena - have introduced many thousands of people to the sound of
  Skylab2000.

  Skylab2000's newest single, "Auburn" includes remixes by LA's Gearwhore and
  superstar DJ Taylor. This has just been released on Fatal Data Records in
  the US, with a UK release on Music Unites/Brianiak to follow shortly.
  Recently the band has been in the studio producing and recording new
  material, and preparing for a European tour starting in April.

  For info, reviews and press clippings on our dance, techno, ambient and 
  acid projects, set your browser to the heart of our little universe -

Hi Cybertribe -

Just a reminder that tomorrow, January 31, is the last day to send me

So Jeremy's would read (you saw mine last time) -

Any questions, email me - and again, we WILL have those "hello my name

the door as well.

Okay, right now I am going nuts.  Tomorrow I lobby God to see if I can get
a 28 hour day.  ;) I am driving around all over the place and listening to
the tapes that have been submitted and basically going nuts wanting to
hear these people spin.  I wish I could single out one or two particularly
good tapes, but they are all so tasty!  Heh, I just hope I can get some
dancing in. 

I have been talking with Stevie T (syt@po.cwru.edu) of PLRM and it sounds
like he may be doing a van trip out of Ohio (Cleveland/Columbus) so people
may want to contact him about a ride if you are travelling from out that
way.  Remember, the Van Rental FAQ is still available (and there is still
time to put together an inexpensive trip).  Just send me an email and I
will bounce that out to you.  The Atlanta (jedi@crl.com) and North
Carolina (rarousse@eos.ncsu.edu) trips are on. 

I will be posting the tickets flyer again in a little bit as the 
information has been updated with better contact info.  I culled all the 
responses that I have gotten from people requesting flyers and bought a 
bunch of envelopes.  Expect those in the mail very quickly.

Now I have a favor to ask of you.  Now, the party itself is solid.  Got a
full compliment of amazing DJs, the sound systems are set, the site is
solid, I am no longer worrying about the weather (any party that Lonnie is
involved with is immune from bad weather).  Right now we are concentrating
on making the gathering as powerful and pleasant as possible.  Okay, so
this is where the favor comes in.  I want you to think about what both you
and we could do to make the party better and then tell us.  If you could
bring some cake and fruit, some information and good friends, the solution
to crime and poverty, a smile and a hug, things that you or we could share
with someone else to make the party more enjoyable for all.  Just let us
know.. 

We may be setting up a table for selling stuff that people are bringing. 
A few DJs are bringing copies of there tapes (alot of people have been
interested) and want a central location.  If people are interested in
other things, maybe we can run with it. 

Everything is coming together quite nicely.  In the next week I want to
post a preliminary budget of what all the costs are and what is being
spent.  Then I want to put together a list of everyone who has contributed
time and effort to this party, there are 6 (Derrick, Jason, Lonnie, Karin,
Jer and Allison) people out there without whom this party would never have
progressed this far.  Anyhow, I have alot of stuff I want to bring folks 
up to speed on between now and the blessed event.  :)

If it seems like I am a little hard to get in touch with, it's because I
am spending alot of time offline trying to get all this in order in the
less than two weeks we have left.  (LESS THAN TWO WEEKS!  I AM SO HYPED!)
Anyhow, I may be slow with my email responses, but you can always get in
touch with me at 301-441-9328 (always leave a message) or at any parties I
am at. 

Dan

    blender,
    
    i'm sure you've gotten a ton of responses to your post already....
    but i would like to offer the total support of PLRM as kate, stevie 
    t, and myself.  perhaps this kind of information, when assembled, can 
    be included in an upcoming issue.  also, you've got our support in 
    time and communications to distribute these flyers through our 
    distribution network.
    
    please keep me (us) updated on how this project comes along.
    
    RLPU,
    --star* 
    ====================================================================
    
    actually there was a very informative article written by ecto of
    ectographics of montreal entitled 'what you should know about 
    ecstacy' that appeared in the july '95 issue of PLRM. i've been
    thinking about doing an info article about meth, but held back
    because i thought it might end up promoting the drug, which is
    the last thing i wanted.  
    
    actually the total support of PLRM as myself, star, kate, & the
    84 other contributors & distributors of PLRM:

-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  i just did a quickie there for now, coz i'm lazy.  there is also 
   a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if you have an 
   info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Submissions to: s0176326@cc.ysu.edu (preferred) or

cybertribe-

I'm sure you've all been thinking to yourselves...hmm what should I do 
after Mosaic?   Well, there's an easy answer for this.

Come to the  Mosaic   A F T E R P A R T Y   !!!!!!

Hosted by me- Gil, Jill and DaveG  at the famous Squash Court 
space in Baltimore. it will begin as Mosaic ends.

But this won't be like any other afterparty. As soon as you arive at the
space, you will be expected to break out your own sleeping bag or cot (we
have a few sofas, but you really need to bring your own place to be comfy)
and simply go to sleep.  We will have ambient music playing for the first
few hours.  Later in the day after we manage to get a few hours of sleep,
the music will be turned up a notch to maybe some chill dub and house
music.  As evening approaches the music will be brought back up to a
dancable tempo. The idea is to have a great place to recover and still
hang out with friends. 

We are also asking for $2 from all that attend so we can get brunchish
food (bagels, juice, donuts, etc) for everyone in their time of need :)
--

**new & important**

we have only heard from a few people who are interested in this
afterparty.  We really need to guage how many people are coming because
space is limited.  Again, we're offering this for people to crash who need
it.  In the afternoon it would be cool if some of the locals come back -
rested- to hang out for a few more hours. 

So please, if you're planning to come drop us some e-mail. :)

Any questions?  mail me or Jill  :)

jill            &        gil

Okay, two quick notes before I send out the updated tickets and flyers
sheet.  First, I hereby promise myself to quit smoking two days after
Mosaic.  I want to quit now, but the stress is killer and I don't want to
get on that negative withdrawl tip.  Second, it sounds like a good number
of people are coming bearing free tapes.  :) Now that's cool.  There are
so many people doing so many things that it is hard to keep track of (free
tapes, valentine cards, glow in the dark playdoh, etc.).  Anyhow, here's 
the info:

Okay, the tickets and flyers are now available from happy smiling faces 
all over the place.

Tickets are available in three ways:  from local netters, via mail (that's
me) or at the door.  Ticket price is $8 through all outlets.  If you can
prepurchase your tickets please do, it helps to keep the overall stress
levels down and make sure that everything we need for the party is made
available.
