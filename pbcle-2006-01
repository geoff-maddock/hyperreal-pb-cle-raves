Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} The DnB Liberation Front Tour/1.13.06/Cleveland!!!!

Friday, January 13th 2006

In cooperation with Acid Flyers, Parcel Mgmt, and
Zeropoint Recordings...

Bassline Magazine, Street-Kings, & The View present to
you...

The DnB Liberation Front Tour!!!!

The DnB Liberation Front hits the road for a bus tour
beginning January 6th 2006, with the three week
January leg covering the Eastern United States.
Intended to showcase and unite the ever growing North
American drum and bass talent pool, the DnB Liberation
Front aims to embrace the grass roots mentality of the
touring band, by providing audiences with an actual
bus tour, something not typically done in electronic
music. 

The Liberation Front lineup features American
heavyweights Dstar, Mason, Basic Operations, Vector
Burn, Beet & Bad Lieutenant (live), with MC’s
Sharpness and Armanni Reign. All of which, represent
some of the biggest labels in drum and
bass(Metalheadz, C.I.A.,Freak Recordings, Renegade,
Hardware, Human, Habit, Gasm, OG,Zeropoint, and
Obscene to name a few), proving to be a tour de force
of the international scene. The tour, a first of this
kind for the drum and bass industry in America, does
away with the traditional time slotted, dj dominated
events, by providing audiences with an actual
performance based show. Mixing live instrumentation,
dj’ing, and Mc’ing into a mish mash styled event. “We
really wanted to prove to the American drum and bass
scene that this music belongs on the big stages, that
people really want to see and hear this style of
music.” says Mason. Tour Director Douglas McClintock
states, “There’s a huge focus on
the European talent getting all the good gigs, we just
figured there was power in numbers,
and it’s time for audiences to see the big names our
own continent has.”

With dates spanning cities such as Philadelphia,
Cleveland, Chicago, New Orleans, Saint
Louis, Lexington, Greensboro, New York City, Toronto,
and Washington DC, America
seems ready to embrace electronically based music such
as drum and bass. MC
Sharpness sums up the DnBLF’s purpose. “The new
frontier of music entertainment is
upon us, and The DnB Liberation Front is set to
deliver the propaganda of a new era.
For more information on this tour and its dates check
out www.dnbliberation.com


The DnB Liberation Front is on the march! This is a
call to arms. A new dawn is upon us. Four hours of
preaching from America’s new blood. The first tour of
it’s kind in American Drum and Bass. No time-slots, no
rules. THIS IS A LIVE SHOW. Be prepared for anything.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

SUPERSTAR DJ KEOKI (yawn)
*OFFICAL NYC PARTY MONSTER TOUR STOP*
*CD RELEASE for KILL THE DJ*
(Nocturnal DJs, www.djkeoki.com - Los Angeles/NYC)
Tonight we bring you something for friday the 13th that is truely 
hardcore in the underground movement.DJ KEOKI. Either loved or hated, 
Keoki is never ignored . . . Keoki is America's own superstar DJ. 
Alongside the stalwarts from across the sea, Keoki stands tall: A 
million records sold. Magazine cover boy. Billboard Dance Chart 
dominator. Cross-country jetsetter. A major musical contributor to a 
cultural phenomenon. A pioneer for dance music in the USA. Keoki is all 
of these things and more. Immersing himself in the growing dance music 
culture inNYC IN 1985, Keoki made a huge impact on dance culture in the 
USA. What Keoki possessed that othersof his era lacked was the 
anarchistic flamboyance and showmanship that accompanied his sublime 
musical creativity. Whereas many DJs could put together solid, 
floor-shaking mixes, Keoki added so much more, and his personal style, 
both in terms of fashion,lifestyle, and music,landed him right in the 
iconic center of the Club Kid movement in the early '90s when Keoki 
maintained a legendary residency at the Disco 2000 night at NYC's 
Limelight.Now touring on the Party Monster tour, supporting the now cult 
classic movie portraying the scandelous occurances at the Limelight and 
touring in support of his new mix CD "KILL THE DJ" get ready to 
experience it all again..
MONEY.SUCCESS.FAME.GLAMOR.


ROB GEE
(Adam Worldwide, AMPT, La Corstra Nostra -NJ)
What Hardcore event would be complete without MR Gee?? Rob's dynamic 
stage presence and floor rocking anthem's have become a staple through 
out the scene. From coast to coast, Europe and back again. Rob Gee
is at the forfront on the Hardcore Gabber movement. Branching out into 
outher areas with his band AMPT featuring members of slipknot & 
Biohazard, there is no turning back now. Rob's also become one of the
big players in the event cordination scene now, making larger massives 
in the northeast take place with a lil' touch O GEE.. to kick it up a 
notch, such as WHISTLE, BANG etc.. See you motherfuckers in the pit.


ADAM X
*Industrial techno Fetish set*
(Sonic Groove - NYC)
LEGEND. No if, and's or but's about it. Adam's flawless mixing, and 
taste in techno has left him a permenant leader in the electronic 
community. Along side his brother, Frankie Bones, and Heather Heart this 
techno treo helped form the scene in which we know today, and schooling 
us all to what it truely means to be underground. We are thrilled to 
have Adam at this event, get ready for the unexpected.


ATOMIC BABIES *LIVE PA*
(Adrenaline AM, Hidden Dimension - Brooklyn NY)
One of our close personal friends, Joey Jupiter aka the Atomic Babies 
relentless techno Live PA's have rocked countless dancefloors over the 
years. Playing at raves & massives far and wide. After an absolutely
amazing performance @ Lost In Space, and at the WHISTLE afterparty, we 
had to have him back. Live and direct.. act like you know.

Saturday - 01.21.06 - Pittsburgh, PA

DJ ICEY - Zone Records/Essential Mix/FFRR Recordings - Orlando
djicey.com

Born and raised in Florida, DJ Icey has been mesmerized by electronic
music ever since hearing the synthesizer breakdown on The Edgar Winter
Group's .Frankenstein". Rising to worldwide prominence out of the
fertile Orlando Florida electronic music scene, Icey cut his teeth at
the legendary EDGE nightclub in the mid-90s. With over 200 12. singles
under his production belt, and playing 100+ gigs per year, Icey is a
touring maniac. But that doesn't keep him out of the studio during the
week working on new tracks for his Labels Zone and Tree records,
constantly trying to push the envelope to make his fans sweat on the
dancefloor.


w/special guests:
DJ KARES - digitalgoodtime.com - Boston

Rapidly becoming a recognizable face in the dance scene, Kares has been
enamoring partygoers across the United States as her infectious positive
attitude envelops dancefloors both big and small when she drops her
signature funky, progressive sound.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Pics from NYE in Toronto at time 2 move

my pictures - http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/2005-12-31-time2move 
(stopped taking em sometime thru the night because i was sooooper 
preoccupied :)
bills - http://www.ravefuel.com/gallery/time2move

my sorta review - cut-n-pasted from 
http://www.troutsoup.com/archives/002078.php

saturday morning 8am alarm, yucko. still got up with plenty of time, i 
was still fidgety right off because i just wanted to get the fuck out of 
ohio. bill grabbed me, then off to pick up jessica and after some minor 
detours and delays we got to todds and on the road for canada. crammed 
in the back of todds car isn't much fun, but we made due. starting some 
minor partying in the car to help pass the time, crossing the canadian 
border was about as painless as it gets. it also started snowing about 
that time. ick. thats the one bad thing about canada. ohio winters suck 
but canadas are worse.

texted everyone i could think of before crossing to see who all was en 
route already. some were at the hotel already from the night before, but 
everyone was on their way. a few miles into canada my cell went DOA. no 
service for me up there. blah.

we stop at elijahs house to chat a bit and pick some stuff up. we watch 
his dog hump someones leg wayyyyyyy too much. weird dog.......

we hear they have some wristband thing going on and aren't letting 
people into the hotel without them. wtf? well they weren't doing it when 
we got there so lucky us because we weren't checking in till the next 
day. we chill in dans room for a bit beforehand, meet some new kids and 
work our way over to the venue. i was under the impression it was the 
upstairs part of the big bop, but it was the same room as last new years 
eve. party there. entry was fast, good thing, it was hella cold, my nose 
froze up inside. ick.

things started off slow, the euro-set wasn't that interesting, even 
though i like the stuff. no left turn needs to get new euro records or 
stop doing it, i used to think it was funny, but those same songs over 
and over has gotten old.

frolic went on and played a dull set, honestly i dont get why people are 
so into him. anyhow the hulla (wannabe) ravers left as soon as he was 
done, it was really obvious they were only there to see him spin and 
little else.

the nice guys, while having sweet masked wrestler outfits, didn't 
interest me a whole lot. dunno.

anyhow, things really took off after knifehandchop went on, that guy is 
amazingly sick. and about that time me and jess got stuck to this sooper 
comfy chair next to a speaker stack and pretty much stayed there until 
they kicked us out at the end of the party.

lady bass and opel destroyed it. why do i have to go to canada to hear 
good uk hardhouse/nrg? well there is mot locally that has some good uk 
hardhouse stuff, but until about a month ago i never heard of the guy. 
maybe he'll end up playing out more in crakron?

jess's ex ended up at the party, kind of a downer. caused all sorts of 
mild drama and aggravation, i dont know why she puts up with it really.

hopped around between hotel rooms all new years day, noone knew of 
anything going on worthwhile that night, so we just partied like 
rockstars. okay really dull boring rockstars but still.....

jess slept through the alarm for like 3 hours, i thought i was bad at 
times. yeeessshhhhh.... she ended up leaving with matt and mike since 
they were leaving earlier and she needed to get to work.

the drive home pretty much sucked until we hit the US and my cellie 
worked again and i could text people again, kept myself busy most of the 
drive home with that.

after getting back into crapland, err ohio, we hit up the firehouse for 
their 4$ steaks to find out they're now 5$ steaks, meh. still a cheap 
price. ended up home and saw my laptop parts were there already. sweet, 
i have a working laptop again. yey!

thanks to dan and adrienne for their hospitality and good seeing 
everyone. so whens the next one

geezus, those fuckers weren't pulling any punches. i got there before 11 
and it was ripping 150bpm ish already and just went up from there. 

definately more people there than i expected.  most seemed shellshocked 
about the whole thing, some got up and danced a bit probably after being 
loosened up by the pbr  :)

sucks i had to work early so couldn't stick around.

It's too pizazzy for me, but tastes okay otherwise... Drinking a 6pack
of it seems impossible for me I just get too bloated from the fizz.

Maybe the guy that gave it the blue ribbon was just broke and was so
glad there was a beer he could afford?

I dunno... why don't they ever have beers with American sounding
names? Like say "John smith" beer or somehting.

pabst.com says:
PBR is not just any beer- so you would expect the history to be a bit 
unusual, and it is. Pabst was originally called "Select," but people 
started asking for that "Blue Ribbon" beer in 1882 when we started tying 
silk ribbons to the bottles. We officially added the words "Blue Ribbon" 
to the bottle in 1895.

the blue ribbon obviously doesn't mean anything. other than marketting 
nonsense.

well the hipsters picked up on it a few years back. part of that whole 
"ironic" thing.  drink the cheapest, most non-trendy beer en masse, thus 
making it trendy.

i got my love of pbr at the penguin pub.  2.50 happy hour pitchers.  
gotta love it.  "PBR ME ASAP"......

There must be some secret to drinking PBR... Drinking a 6 pack of them

It's too pizazzy for me, but tastes okay otherwise... Drinking a 6pack
of it seems impossible for me I just get too bloated from the fizz.

Maybe the guy that gave it the blue ribbon was just broke and was so
glad there was a beer he could afford?

I dunno... why don't they ever have beers with American sounding
names? Like say "John smith" beer or somehting.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} goahead crew at ECC last night

i stand corrected, from http://www.americanbreweriana.org/history/pabst.htm

The famous "Blue Ribbon" label did not get started until 1882. Prior to 
1882, Phillip Best Brewing Company had received awards for their beer. 
In 1876, Pabst won both the highest awards for bottled beer and a gold 
medal. In 1878 at a Paris World’s Fair, Pabst again won more medals.

In 1882, bottling became significantly important to the brewing 
business. When bottles were first used, these were generally plain and 
were not appealing to the public. Pabst decided to add pieces of blue 
ribbons tied around the necks of Best "Select" beer bottles. It didn’t 
take long before the public continued to ask for "The beer with the blue 
ribbon." By 1892, this special packaging idea became so popular that the 
company was purchasing 300,000 yards of silk ribbons, which workers tied 
by hand around each bottle. In 1895, words "Blue Ribbon" were eventually 
added to the label of Select Beer, and in January 1898, the Blue Ribbon 
label was first used.

In 1893, at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Pabst won five medals 
and an honorable mention. When a jury was then established to present 
the highest award for beer, an argument was developed by all the 
breweries who entered in the contest. The eastern breweries complained 
they were not represented correctly and the western brewers complained

<dd>The famous &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; label did not get started until
1882. Prior to<br>

<dd>1882, Phillip Best Brewing Company had received awards for their
beer.<br>

<dd>In 1876, Pabst won both the highest awards for bottled beer and a
gold <br>

<dd>medal. In 1878 at a Paris World's Fair, Pabst again won more
medals.<br><br>

<dd>In 1882, bottling became significantly important to the brewing<br>

<dd>business. When bottles were first used, these were generally plain
and<br>

<dd>were not appealing to the public. Pabst decided to add pieces of
blue<br>

<dd>ribbons tied around the necks of Best &quot;Select&quot; beer
bottles. It didn't<br>

<dd>take long before the public continued to ask for &quot;The beer with
the blue <br>

<dd>ribbon.&quot; By 1892, this special packaging idea became so popular
that the<br>

<dd>company was purchasing 300,000 yards of silk ribbons, which workers
tied<br>

<dd>by hand around each bottle. In 1895, words &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot;
were eventually <br>

<dd>added to the label of Select Beer, and in January 1898, the Blue
Ribbon<br>

<dd>label was first used.<br><br>

<dd>In 1893, at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Pabst won five
medals<br>

<dd>and an honorable mention. When a jury was then established to present
<br>

<dd>the highest award for beer, an argument was developed by all the<br>

<dd>breweries who entered in the contest. The eastern breweries
complained<br>

<dd>they were not represented correctly and the western brewers
complained<br>

<dd>that the jury members were not beer experts. The judges confused
things <br>

<dd>more by making a preliminary finding in favor of Anheuser-Busch as
the<br>

<dd>winner. After a review of the chemical analysis, the judges then
gave<br>

<dd>the top award to Pabst. Even a legal action threat from
Anheuser-Busch <br>

<dd>didn't change the judge's minds.<br><br>

ECC has never tried charging me a cover?  least on the mental floss 
nights.  i've been there for other random stuff in the past and it was 
free too?  straubs on tap is my ace.....  tho i think i mentioned that 
the other day

Sorry for the spam, but since this a pretty good deal I'm sure some of =
you won't mind.

I'm looking to re-arrange some stuff this year at the store and since we =
are still in the end of the year/beginning of the year slump and I think =
this is a great time for a sale since everything will be back to normal =
(for January) in another week.  This is a great time to build your =
collection up and find those tracks that no one else will be able to get =
their hands on ;)

For members of our mailing list... tomorrow there will be a small list =
of new 2006 releases and restocks and more to come on Friday.  So in the =
meantime while the UK suppliers and US distributers get themselves back =
to gether here are the details of the sale...


50% OFF EVERYTHING received into inventory BEFORE OCTOBER 1, 2005
ALL THIS WEEK -  SATURDAY JANUARY 14 is the LAST DAY.

NEW STUFF is NOT ON SALE.=20
**New stuff means anything received in OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER, and =
JANUARY.  We carry represses of older titles, these are not included in =
the sale.  All of our $3.99 and $7.99 markdowns are included, so you can =
end up with $2 domestics and $4 imports.  You can't beat that with a =
stick! =20

YOU MUST SPEND at least $50 - that's the catch.
** This means your total before discount must be over $100. If you can't =
meet the minimum, it's still cool because I'll give ya %35 off sale =
items anyways.  If you are buying markdowns, the reduced price is what =
counts towards the minimum if you want them for $2.  =20

Here is the list
http://www.poo-bas.com/releases/stock.htm is a list of titles that are =
on sale.  Our inventory isn't always accurate, but we do our best.  This =
a different list from last week and a little more accurate. =20

THERE ARE SOME KILLER HARD TO FIND AND OUT OF PRINT RECORDS in those =
stacks, but there is a lot to go through.
If you pull a stack of stuff, I'll gladly help you weed it out and say =
"don't listen to that" if I know it is not what you are looking for.=20

There are some records, mostly from the 90's, that aren't on the =
inventory list which I will include for $2 a piece in this sale.\
Those are the ones below the "boat".=20


=20
PIONEER SALE
If you are into PIONEER brand DJ products... there is a sale going on =
right now where I can get you the lowest prices ANYWHERE on the =
following items: =20

Pioneer CMX-3000 CD Player Pioneer Dual Rackmount CD Player=20
Pioneer Pro DVD Turntable Pioneer DVJ-X1 DVD Turntable=20
Pioneer CDJ-200 Pro CD/MP3 Player Pioneer CDJ-200 Pro CD/MP3 Player=20
Pioneer Pro DJ Mixer Pioneer DJM-300 DJ Mixer - Silver=20
Pioneer Pro DJ Effector Pioneer EFX-500 DJ Effector=20
Pioneer Pro DJ Effector Pioneer EFX-500 DJ Effector - Red=20

CALL FOR PRICES.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  MANY ITEMS ARE 3 DAY =
DELIVERY, SOME MAY TAKE 2 WEEKS.

 Marc Emery: My message to you   
   by Marc Emery (17 Aug, 2005)        Marc writes about the extradition case, and reflects on his activist career. 
  I had that ‘life flashing before me’ moment. The frozen second in time when everything was sharp, clear, and signalled a great convergence of all my effort into this precise moment. 

“Marc Emery, you are under arrest for Extradition to The United States of America.”

All my seeds sold, all the millions of dollars I had given to the cause, every speech to free our people, every arrest, jailing and raid I had endured: it was all for this moment in time. “For trafficking in marijuana seeds, for the production of marijuana, and for money laundering”

In 1990, when I became a cannabis activist, all books, magazines, videos, pipes, bongs, everything about even saying the word marijuana was illegal in Canada. 

As a bookseller at the City Lights Bookshop in London, Ontario, I was surprised and shocked to learn that the Canadian government had banned High Times Magazine, had police seize all copies of marijuana growing books (including the Canadian classic Grow Yer Own Stone), and had pushed over 500 ‘head’ shops across Canada into shutting down.

There was no cannabis activist movement left. No books, no magazines, no activists, no hemp stores. Nothing.

Into this strange wilderness, I decided that as a bookseller, I had to defy this peculiar law that passed almost unanimously in the Canadian Parliament, with only one lone opponent, NDP Member of Parliament Svend Robinson, in 1987.

In the fall of 1990, I ordered through the mail a few copies of the Emperor Wears No Clothes, the classic book on the suppression of hemp by Jack Herer. Not available in Canada because of the ban (section 462.2 of the Criminal Code provided up to 6 months in jail, and/or up to a $100,000 fine for distributing books and any printed matter about marijuana or any ‘illicit’ drug), I imported copies (illegally) and bought newspaper ads in the London Free Press, my hometown daily, to announce that I was breaking the literature ban on marijuana and welcomed the local police to arrest me.

This approach had always worked well for me in the ten years leading up to this time, as I went to court and jail after deliberately breaking the laws on Sunday shopping, the obscenity laws, and other Canadian social control laws that I personally helped change.

Protesting began immediatelyWhile I was handcuffed and being delivered to the dank cells of the Halifax lock-up, raids by Vancouver police were underway in my home, my offices, and the BCMP Bookstore in Vancouver. No real quantities of drugs or marijuana were found, and in fact really only 5,000 seeds at the most were available to be taken. Up to 50 police officers were used to comb the premises of all the locations. A battering ram was used to force the door at 22 East Cordova Street. Various computers were taken but little else was of interest to police. Warrants specified that any records relating to the seed business were to be seized. Presumably, police have access to phone records to calls made to Marc Emery Seeds. Otherwise, it wasn’t a business where we kept records. We destroyed all information after sending out orders.

In my cell in the Halifax lock-up, I knew that my life had entered a critical and inevitable phase. I have always been very, very transparent in the way I have conducted a career I have often described as ‘revolutionary retail’ or ‘capitalist activism’. From the day I arrived in Vancouver on March 1st 1994, I was going to change the way marijuana activism existed. Even by 1994, everything about cannabis and used to enjoy cannabis was still illegal in Canada, and I was determined to make an aggressive change in this landscape.

Penniless after losing all my money on an ill-advised house building project in Indonesia, I arrived for the first time in my life in Vancouver, British Columbia, determined to build a movement that used a retail model to generate money that would feed a vast network of activism. Within days of getting off the plane, I was selling High Times Magazine and a variety of banned marijuana grow books that had been fronted to me by a distributor. I sold door-to-door, to strangers on the street, to magazine stores, to book stores, to students. I would make on average $1 profit per item, and fortunately, after 6 years of non-availability, there was a pent-up demand in this new place. 

My children, spouse and I lived on $20 a day for food, and all other money was put back into these books and magazines. Within one year, I was distributing 2,000 copies a month of High Times magazine and was wholesaling and mail order retailing over 40 books about marijuana and other ‘illicit’ entheogens. After selling these products on the street for 3 months, a former Communist book shop that had been subject of a firebombing was available to me for $500 first month’s rent, and as long as I cleaned the heavily damaged building up, the landlord said my ‘Hemp revolution business’, as I explained it to him, was fine. 

On July 7, 1994, I opened the HEMP BC retail store and began a decade of principled, purposeful lawbreaking, every action aimed at ending the marijuana prohibition by any peaceful means possible.

While the police were raiding the various places they believed seeds and records were stored, activists like David Malmo-Levine and brave others protested the attack with street protests. The media, who were informed immediately by Chris Bennett and the Cannabis Culture magazine team, descended on the scene at BCMP Headquarters. Within hours everyone in British Columbia was bombarded in the media with the news that the US government was seeking to extradite myself and two friends back to the USA for my seed selling ways. It was clear the potential penalties were severe if I were to be extradited and prosecuted in the US, probably a life imprisonment. Under Drug Kingpin legislation, selling over 60,000 seeds qualifies for the death penalty in the United States. The manufacture or distribution of 60,000 kilograms of marijuana, 60,000 plants or 60,000 seeds all are included in death penalty provisions of the medieval law passed by a Newt Gingrich congress. I would be the first person
 under this recent law who could qualify to be executed for the activity I have clearly done with the tacit approval of everyone in Canada.

Revenue Canada received $578,000 in personal income taxes (1999 to 2005) on income that was explicitly from the sale of marijuana seeds, and they ALWAYS were aware of it. It said “Marijuana Seed Vendor” on my tax returns. I explained my entire banking and money systems and always gave income tax all access to my accounts so they could verify everything I said was true. I told them the Money Mart location where I cashed money orders; my bank accounts were explained so they could track the flow of money. I explained how expenses and disbursements worked in the incriminating world of seeds. They knew how it all worked because I had nothing to hide. The government of Canada received about $378,000 of this money; the provincial government of British Columbia received about $200,000.

As to politicians, every Member of Parliament in Canada, all 305, had a free subscription to our magazine, which often their assistants read and perused if not the Member themselves, for eight years. My seed catalogue was in every issue. They knew it was there. None ever complained to me or the police about it. Former MP Svend Robinson has said that when he was NDP Health Critic and he asked Health Canada where medical cannabis people were supposed to obtain seeds, “Health Canada said to go to the internet and buy seeds there.” And that’s what he told them to do: buy seeds on the internet. In fact, that’s what Health Canada told others also in letters that we have from Health Canada in 2003.

NDP leader Jack Layton came to my home 18 months ago and did a beautiful interview on POT-TV. I think Jack Layton is a wonderful guy. I think NDP Justice Critic Libby Davies has done a sterling job. If I had any kind of reputation as a ‘drug dealer’, do you think a man who is a serious contender for Prime Minister (as Jack Layton now exceeds Paul Martin or Stephen Harper in polls measuring trustworthiness and competence) is going to some drug dealer’s house to publicly ask for support? 

The BCMP search warrantI was asked to testify before the Senate Subcommittee in both 1996 and 2002 as to my views on legalizing marijuana. Do you think they would ask any known drug dealer to attend? 

When the Wall Street Journal put me on the front page of its massively influential newspaper in a very favourable article ten years ago on Dec. 10, 1995, Quentin Hardy, the journalist who wrote it, told me six editors were assigned to check out my background. “They talked to your teachers, your neighbours, business associates, your parents. They are NOT going to let anyone with even a whiff of ‘drug dealer’ appear on that front page.” Nine years later, Mr. Hardy came to British Columbia and wrote the definitive piece on the British Columbia marijuana industry for Forbes Magazine, and I personally introduced him to many in the industry while he did that piece.

I spoke at IDEA CITY in 2001 and 2003. I spoke on the same stage at former Prime Ministers John Turner and Kim Campbell, and I was the marijuana provider to many famous Canadians at the Friday Night IDEA CITY Party at MUCH MUSIC/CHUM TV. In my speeches I talked about the incredible work in helping 18 year old Webster Alexander in Alabama, having his sentence for selling two ounces of pot reduced from an unbelievable 36 years to one year served on weekends. I talked about the amazing work at my Iboga Therapy House, with heavily drug addicted persons and the amazing results we had. I talked about my mission in life and how I had developed this ‘seed thing’ that paid for immense amounts of activism. 

My very transparent manifesto, “How to Overgrow the Government through revolutionary retail” was known to every journalist in Canada. I was written up and covered in TIME Magazine (Canada, USA, worldwide), MacLean’s Magazine (Canada), The Economist (Worldwide), CNN, Mexico’s La Reforma, The Times of India, and hundreds of other publications world-wide. I never received one letter from ANYONE in 10 years asking me to stop selling seeds. No one on the streets of Vancouver or anywhere in Canada where I have spoken extensively (22 cities in 2003, 19 cities in 2004) has ever approached me and said “I don’t like what you are doing by selling seeds”. I have never received, as far as I can recall, a letter or a phone call or correspondence of any kind from anyone in Canada asking or demanding that I stop the sale and distribution of seeds.

In my time in British Columbia (over 11 years now), I never owned a car, any property, bonds, investments, assets, offshore accounts. Nothing but the things necessary to produce information or revenue for our beloved cause. I leased everything on a month-by-month basis. If I had money stashed, the police or Income Tax people would have found it. I was watched extensively. I presumed my cell phone was always monitored. When the DEA undercover agent tried to get me to sell her ten pounds of pot over the phone, I refused and told her that I always assumed my cell phone was monitored, so how could she be so foolish and naïve. When she asked again at a later time, I lectured her at length. Not only did I not sell pot, but she was very foolish to even think about importing pot to the USA. 

Marc during the May 2005 electionThe DEA even has a subscription to Cannabis Culture, with their money orders on US Department of Justice stationery. I figured if the US government was that pissed off, they’d just ask the Vancouver Police to raid me like in the 1996 to 1998 period. I was always raided after appearing in A-list US media. A month after the Wall Street Journal: raided. A month after Rolling Stone: raided. Two months after the CNN special (CNN Visits Canada’s Prince of Pot): raided. The police took a million dollars in store and business assets in total, but I was not even charged on two occasions, and received small fines from the courts when I was charged on two others. The last fine I got for selling seeds in 1998 was $2,000. From $2,000 in 1998, to life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty in 2005... that’s a fantastic contrast.

A lot of good was accomplished through all of that struggle, trial and tribulation. In 1994, there were no hemp stores, no activist activity, no medical marijuana program, no pot retail industry, not even legally obtained books and magazines about marijuana in Canada. Now, eleven years later there are over 75 hemp activist stores, literature and magazines were made legal, medical marijuana is legal, the hemp industry is in a revival. Marijuana legalization and the drug war have been discussed in the Canadian media every day for the past ten years. Regulations continue to improve for Canada’s medical cannabis program. 

Phillip Owen, a former Mayor of Vancouver (1993 to 2001) was at one time in office a very vocal prohibitionist. He denounced me in the New York Times. But by the end of his third term, he became a brilliant and articulate anti-prohibitionist. He met with the US Drug Czar John Walters and said “It was the most intense meeting of my life. There is no one more uninformed about drugs than a drug Czar.” 

Current Mayor, and newly appointed Senator, Larry Campbell was my rival for Mayor in the Vancouver 2002 election. I got to speak about legalization on over 15 occasions in his presence. He was elected. He spoke at the Beyond Prohibition 2004 Conference in which a grant from Marc Emery Direct Seed proceeds went to the BC Civil Liberties Association ($18,000) to produce the conference where Mr. Campbell famously and momentously announced that marijuana should legalized, taxed and regulated, and that prohibition should end.

I participated in elections in 1996 (Mayor of Vancouver); 2000 (Canadian Marijuana Party, federal election); 2001 (BC Marijuana Party, provincial election); 2002 (Mayor of Vancouver); 2005 (BC Marijuana Party, provincial election). Only a few months ago, I was invited to a fundraiser by Tim Stevenson, who is on Vancouver City Council. During the recent 2005 provincial election he unfortunately lost his bid for MLA by 11 votes. But he had introduced me proudly to his supporters and said “Marc is here to lend his support because he knows I believe in legalization.” And I did not run against him in that riding because Tim is a good man; but again, do you think if there was any taint anywhere in my life that these people would introduce me to crowds of key supporters?

Marc doing what he does bestAdriane Carr is leader of the BC Green Party. In 2002, the BC Greens launched a petition drive to get proportional representation on the ballot as a people’s initiative. The BC Greens didn’t have the money, I believed in the cause, so I gave Adrianne Carr $8,000 personally to finance the petition drive. That was seed money. I’ve never had any other source of income.

I never met a person, government, government agency, politician, tax department, or any charitable or non-governmental agency who ever refused any money from me, even though I was world famous as a marijuana seed seller. Banks opened accounts and issued credit cards, and I was honest and candid with every last one of them.

Over 10 years, I gave $4,000,000 Canadian to activist organizations, activist politicians, ballot initiatives throughout the United States, referendums, court challenges, Supreme Court of Canada challenges, refugees, bail costs, legal defence funds, political parties, individuals, drug addiction clinics, media, medical bills for activists (Terence McKenna, Jack Herer), Compassion Clubs (legal bills and start-up money), Hemp fests, conferences, Global Marijuana Marches (2000 to 2005), full page ads in Canadian newspapers, HEMP BC Legal Assistance Centre... and the list goes on. It’s an extraordinary record of unparalleled distribution of the proceeds from our beloved plant. 

And I never met anyone who complained. Even that last judge who fined me in 1999 for that 1998 seed charge gave a nice speech on my behalf, decrying the drug war.

Overgrow the Government. Absolutely right. Inherent in that beautiful phrase are so many ideals and glories of a co-operative, peaceful society. Plant the seeds of freedom. Not overthrow, which speaks of violent conflict. But overgrow, using God’s greatest plant, and the enlightenment that comes from ingesting marijuana, to further a peaceful, democratic, revolution based on tolerance and peace and unity of all peoples. Plants, not violence. Reason, not murderous incarceration. Personal freedom, not the Nazified paramilitary violence of the DEA.

I am being punished for my success. I have achieved much in my eleven years, but clearly now, the enemy, the very dark and powerful forces emanating from the White House believe they have the upper hand. That they have stopped our revolution. That this is the time when the Bush-Walters White House is making the most aggressive attack on our culture ever, and I don’t mean just on me. The current Rolling Stone talks of the Bush White House and the DEA arresting more Americans than ever before for marijuana, and pursuing us with a frenzy not yet seen in history.

My wonderful friend Mike Smith last March 2004 received a 30 year sentence in an Oklahoma federal prison for growing 200 plants. He had already spent six years on a previous cultivation offence. His wife, Yvonne Toy, received a 15 year sentence, her first offence ever, for those same 200 plants.

Not comprehensible to the sensitive, rational mind. Why would beautiful people like Yvonne and Mike be given medieval torture like that over marijuana? Why would the taxpayers of America spend a million dollars to make them miserable in a cold unloving and dangerous federal prison? This is madness.

And so this is my request, this is a challenge. Help me cope through this very difficult period ahead. You know I will try to speak on behalf of our culture with passion, reason and good values. In the months ahead, I will be interviewed extensively, and I hope I am a spokesman and activist and leader you can be proud of.

Now I live at your pleasure. Any money I use to live on will be charitable donations from people like you. Pot-TV, CC Magazine, the BCMP: they cannot be giving me money. I returned my rented car, moved into a small affordable apartment, and am selling my furnishings. I work every day and have no leisure time. 

If you believe that this record of service to our culture merits your support, then I will tell you that we can use your support.

Marc and Michelle at Toke The VoteAs you know, I am not afraid of jail, I am not afraid to die. But I do not want to see Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams get extradited. Michelle Rainey is the most selfless activist I have ever known. A fantastic woman who daily suffers with Crohns Disease, needs marijuana to control her very damaged and disabled organs, yet has helped hundreds, if not thousands of people with her unrelenting effort to make marijuana legal. Michelle has been my greatest ally in this struggle, and she surely should be nominated for Sainthood. She is so worthy of your support. She MUST NOT be extradited to a US jail. She will die in horrible pain there. My American friends, and my Canadian friends, this cannot be permitted to happen. A terrible injustice will have occurred if Michelle Rainey exists in pain and torture in an American jail. There will terrible karma in the world if one of God’s most beautiful souls is allowed to be destroyed by apathy and cowardice in
 this, her most critical time of need. The people can save her from extradition, if they speak out to the Canadian Minister of Justice. Speak to power, my friends, her life depends on it.

Greg Williams, aka Marijuana Man, is a fine and wonderful man who brought knowledge, joy and good feelings to everyone he met. He is being punished for being a good friend to me and the movement; he did what hundreds of us do every day in Canada, which is to help people find the cannabis products they are looking for. 

Marijuana is a 7 to 15 billion dollar industry in Canada, where hundreds of thousands of us, perhaps half a million people, are growing marijuana, and selling marijuana. Millions and millions of Canadians and Americans consume this marijuana. Canadian growers, dealers, and seed sellers deal with Americans every day. Now we could all be extradited, because if you have any minor connection to any marijuana transaction that leads to the USA, you are liable to be considered party to a conspiracy to import marijuana into the United States. That’s certainly bringing the US drug war into Canada in an incredible and dangerous way. Everyone in the cannabis culture in Canada is now at much greater risk by this precedent set.

Yet Canadians don’t want this barbaric drug war. In the 10 years of our activism, Canadians now overwhelmingly reject fines, jail time or any sanction as an option for marijuana possession, according to a Nov. 2004 Nation-wide SES poll (which our seed money paid for). A majority of Canadians favour a tax and regulated way of distributing marijuana.

While Canada pursues an independent approach to cannabis laws and prohibition, away from the US drug war model, there is hope for both Canadians and Americans of the cannabis culture. If Canada becomes prohibition free, then American prohibition will fall. But if the United States government is allowed to triumph with intimidation, blackmail, and increased arrests in Canada, stifling our progress, sending Canada backwards, then liberation for all North America is that much more elusive.

The frozen second in time when everything was sharp, clear, and signalled a great convergence of all my effort into this precise moment. <br><br>“Marc Emery, you are under arrest for Extradition to The United States of America.”<br><br>All my seeds sold, all the millions of dollars I had given to the cause, every speech to free our people, every arrest, jailing and raid I had endured: it was all for this
 moment in time. “For trafficking in marijuana seeds, for the production of marijuana, and for money laundering”<br><br>In 1990, when I became a cannabis activist, all books, magazines, videos, pipes, bongs, everything about even saying the word marijuana was illegal in Canada. <br><br>As a bookseller at the City Lights Bookshop in London, Ontario, I was surprised and shocked to learn that the Canadian government had banned <i>High Times Magazine</i>, had police seize all copies of marijuana growing books (including the Canadian classic <i>Grow Yer Own Stone</i>), and had pushed over 500 ‘head’ shops across Canada into shutting down.<br><br>There was no cannabis activist movement left. No books, no magazines, no activists, no hemp stores. Nothing.<br><br>Into this strange wilderness, I decided that as a bookseller, I had to defy this peculiar law that passed almost unanimously in the Canadian Parliament, with only one lone opponent, NDP Member of Parliament Svend Robinson, in
 1987.<br><br>In the fall of 1990, I ordered through the mail a few copies of the <i>Emperor Wears No Clothes</i>, the classic book on the suppression of hemp by Jack Herer. Not available in Canada because of the ban (section 462.2 of the Criminal Code provided up to 6 months in jail, and/or up to a $100,000 fine for distributing books and any printed matter about marijuana or any ‘illicit’ drug), I imported copies (illegally) and bought newspaper ads in the London Free Press, my hometown daily, to announce that I was breaking the literature ban on marijuana and welcomed the local police to arrest me.<br><br>This approach had always worked well for me in the ten years leading up to this time, as I went to court and jail after deliberately breaking the laws on Sunday shopping, the obscenity laws, and other Canadian social control laws that I personally helped change.<br><br><table align="left"><tbody><tr><td><img vsapce="5" alt="Protesting began immediately"
 src="http://www.cannabisculture.com/library/images/uploads/4482-Protest.jpg" align="right" hspace="5"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="-2"><i>Protesting began immediately</i></font></td></tr></tbody></table>While I was handcuffed and being delivered to the dank cells of the Halifax lock-up, raids by Vancouver police were underway in my home, my offices, and the BCMP Bookstore in Vancouver. No real quantities of drugs or marijuana were found, and in fact really only 5,000 seeds at the most were available to be taken. Up to 50 police officers were used to comb the premises of all the locations. A battering ram was used to force the door at 22 East Cordova Street. Various computers were taken but little else was of interest to police. Warrants specified that any records relating to the seed business were to be seized. Presumably, police have access to phone records to calls made to Marc Emery Seeds. Otherwise, it wasn’t a business where we kept records. We
 destroyed all information after sending out orders.<br><br>In my cell in the Halifax lock-up, I knew that my life had entered a critical and inevitable phase. I have always been very, very transparent in the way I have conducted a career I have often described as ‘revolutionary retail’ or ‘capitalist activism’. From the day I arrived in Vancouver on March 1st 1994, I was going to change the way marijuana activism existed. Even by 1994, everything about cannabis and used to enjoy cannabis was still illegal in Canada, and I was determined to make an aggressive change in this landscape.<br><br>Penniless after losing all my money on an ill-advised house building project in Indonesia, I arrived for the first time in my life in Vancouver, British Columbia, determined to build a movement that used a retail model to generate money that would feed a vast network of activism. Within days of getting off the plane, I was selling <i>High Times Magazine</i> and a variety of banned marijuana grow
 books that had been fronted to me by a distributor. I sold door-to-door, to strangers on the street, to magazine stores, to book stores, to students. I would make on average $1 profit per item, and fortunately, after 6 years of non-availability, there was a pent-up demand in this new place. <br><br>My children, spouse and I lived on $20 a day for food, and all other money was put back into these books and magazines. Within one year, I was distributing 2,000 copies a month of <i>High Times</i> magazine and was wholesaling and mail order retailing over 40 books about marijuana and other ‘illicit’ entheogens. After selling these products on the street for 3 months, a former Communist book shop that had been subject of a firebombing was available to me for $500 first month’s rent, and as long as I cleaned the heavily damaged building up, the landlord said my ‘Hemp revolution business’, as I explained it to him, was fine. <br><br>On July 7, 1994, I opened the HEMP BC retail store and
 began a decade of principled, purposeful lawbreaking, every action aimed at ending the marijuana prohibition by any peaceful means possible.<br><br><img vsapce="5" alt="" src="http://www.cannabisculture.com/library/images/uploads/4482-DEARaid.jpg" align="right" hspace="5">While the police were raiding the various places they believed seeds and records were stored, activists like David Malmo-Levine and brave others protested the attack with street protests. The media, who were informed immediately by Chris Bennett and the <i>Cannabis Culture</i> magazine team, descended on the scene at BCMP Headquarters. Within hours everyone in British Columbia was bombarded in the media with the news that the US government was seeking to extradite myself and two friends back to the USA for my seed selling ways. It was clear the potential penalties were severe if I were to be extradited and prosecuted in the US, probably a life imprisonment. Under Drug Kingpin legislation, selling over 60,000 seeds
 qualifies for the death penalty in the United States. The manufacture or distribution of 60,000 kilograms of marijuana, 60,000 plants or 60,000 seeds all are included in death penalty provisions of the medieval law passed by a Newt Gingrich congress. I would be the first person under this recent law who could qualify to be executed for the activity I have clearly done with the tacit approval of everyone in Canada.<br><br>Revenue Canada received $578,000 in personal income taxes (1999 to 2005) on income that was explicitly from the sale of marijuana seeds, and they ALWAYS were aware of it. It said “Marijuana Seed Vendor” on my tax returns. I explained my entire banking and money systems and always gave income tax all access to my accounts so they could verify everything I said was true. I told them the Money Mart location where I cashed money orders; my bank accounts were explained so they could track the flow of money. I explained how expenses and disbursements worked in the
 incriminating world of seeds. They knew how it all worked because I had nothing to hide. The government of Canada received about $378,000 of this money; the provincial government of British Columbia received about $200,000.<br><br>As to politicians, every Member of Parliament in Canada, all 305, had a free subscription to our magazine, which often their assistants read and perused if not the Member themselves, for eight years. My seed catalogue was in every issue. They knew it was there. None ever complained to me or the police about it. Former MP Svend Robinson has said that when he was NDP Health Critic and he asked Health Canada where medical cannabis people were supposed to obtain seeds, “Health Canada said to go to the internet and buy seeds there.” And that’s what he told them to do: buy seeds on the internet. In fact, that’s what Health Canada told others also in letters that we have from Health Canada in 2003.<br><br>NDP leader Jack Layton came to my home 18 months ago and
 did a beautiful interview on POT-TV. I think Jack Layton is a wonderful guy. I think NDP Justice Critic Libby Davies has done a sterling job. If I had any kind of reputation as a ‘drug dealer’, do you think a man who is a serious contender for Prime Minister (as Jack Layton now exceeds Paul Martin or Stephen Harper in polls measuring trustworthiness and competence) is going to some drug dealer’s house to publicly ask for support? <br><br><table align="left"><tbody><tr><td><img vsapce="5" alt="The BCMP search warrant" src="http://www.cannabisculture.com/library/images/uploads/4482-SearchWarrant.jpg" align="right" hspace="5"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="-2"><i>The BCMP search warrant</i></font></td></tr></tbody></table>I was asked to testify before the Senate Subcommittee in both 1996 and 2002 as to my views on legalizing marijuana. Do you think they would ask any known drug dealer to attend? <br><br>When the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> put me on the front
 page of its massively influential newspaper in a very favourable article ten years ago on Dec. 10, 1995, Quentin Hardy, the journalist who wrote it, told me six editors were assigned to check out my background. “They talked to your teachers, your neighbours, business associates, your parents. They are NOT going to let anyone with even a whiff of ‘drug dealer’ appear on that front page.” Nine years later, Mr. Hardy came to British Columbia and wrote the definitive piece on the British Columbia marijuana industry for <i>Forbes Magazine</i>, and I personally introduced him to many in the industry while he did that piece.<br><br>I spoke at IDEA CITY in 2001 and 2003. I spoke on the same stage at former Prime Ministers John Turner and Kim Campbell, and I was the marijuana provider to many famous Canadians at the Friday Night IDEA CITY Party at MUCH MUSIC/CHUM TV. In my speeches I talked about the incredible work in helping 18 year old Webster Alexander in Alabama, having his sentence for
 selling two ounces of pot reduced from an unbelievable 36 years to one year served on weekends. I talked about the amazing work at my Iboga Therapy House, with heavily drug addicted persons and the amazing results we had. I talked about my mission in life and how I had developed this ‘seed thing’ that paid for immense amounts of activism. <br><br><image9>My very transparent manifesto, “How to Overgrow the Government through revolutionary retail” was known to every journalist in Canada. I was written up and covered in <i>TIME Magazine</i> (Canada, USA, worldwide), <i>MacLean’s Magazine</i> (Canada), <i>The Economist</i> (Worldwide), CNN, Mexico’s <i>La Reforma</i>, <i>The Times of India</i>, and hundreds of other publications world-wide. I never received one letter from ANYONE in 10 years asking me to stop selling seeds. No one on the streets of Vancouver or anywhere in Canada where I have spoken extensively (22 cities in 2003, 19 cities in 2004) has ever approached me and said “I
 don’t like what you are doing by selling seeds”. I have never received, as far as I can recall, a letter or a phone call or correspondence of any kind from anyone in Canada asking or demanding that I stop the sale and distribution of seeds.<br><br>In my time in British Columbia (over 11 years now), I never owned a car, any property, bonds, investments, assets, offshore accounts. Nothing but the things necessary to produce information or revenue for our beloved cause. I leased everything on a month-by-month basis. If I had money stashed, the police or Income Tax people would have found it. I was watched extensively. I presumed my cell phone was always monitored. When the DEA undercover agent tried to get me to sell her ten pounds of pot over the phone, I refused and told her that I always assumed my cell phone was monitored, so how could she be so foolish and naïve. When she asked again at a later time, I lectured her at length. Not only did I not sell pot, but she was very foolish
 to even think about importing pot to the USA. <br><br></image9><table align="right"><tbody><tr><td><img vsapce="5" alt="Marc during the May 2005 election" src="http://www.cannabisculture.com/library/images/uploads/4482-MarcEmery2.jpg" align="right" hspace="5"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="-2"><i>Marc during the May 2005 election</i></font></td></tr></tbody></table>The DEA even has a subscription to <i>Cannabis Culture</i>, with their money orders on US Department of Justice stationery. I figured if the US government was that pissed off, they’d just ask the Vancouver Police to raid me like in the 1996 to 1998 period. I was always raided after appearing in A-list US media. A month after the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>: raided. A month after <i>Rolling Stone</i>: raided. Two months after the CNN special (<i>CNN Visits Canada’s Prince of Pot</i>): raided. The police took a million dollars in store and business assets in total, but I was not even charged on two
 occasions, and received small fines from the courts when I was charged on two others. The last fine I got for selling seeds in 1998 was $2,000. From $2,000 in 1998, to life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty in 2005... that’s a fantastic contrast.<br><br>A lot of good was accomplished through all of that struggle, trial and tribulation. In 1994, there were no hemp stores, no activist activity, no medical marijuana program, no pot retail industry, not even legally obtained books and magazines about marijuana in Canada. Now, eleven years later there are over 75 hemp activist stores, literature and magazines were made legal, medical marijuana is legal, the hemp industry is in a revival. Marijuana legalization and the drug war have been discussed in the Canadian media every day for the past ten years. Regulations continue to improve for Canada’s medical cannabis program. <br><br>Phillip Owen, a former Mayor of Vancouver (1993 to 2001) was at one time in office a very vocal
 prohibitionist. He denounced me in the <i>New York Times</i>. But by the end of his third term, he became a brilliant and articulate anti-prohibitionist. He met with the US Drug Czar John Walters and said “It was the most intense meeting of my life. There is no one more uninformed about drugs than a drug Czar.” <br><br>Current Mayor, and newly appointed Senator, Larry Campbell was my rival for Mayor in the Vancouver 2002 election. I got to speak about legalization on over 15 occasions in his presence. He was elected. He spoke at the Beyond Prohibition 2004 Conference in which a grant from Marc Emery Direct Seed proceeds went to the BC Civil Liberties Association ($18,000) to produce the conference where Mr. Campbell famously and momentously announced that marijuana should legalized, taxed and regulated, and that prohibition should end.<br><br>I participated in elections in 1996 (Mayor of Vancouver); 2000 (Canadian Marijuana Party, federal election); 2001 (BC Marijuana Party,
 provincial election); 2002 (Mayor of Vancouver); 2005 (BC Marijuana Party, provincial election). Only a few months ago, I was invited to a fundraiser by Tim Stevenson, who is on Vancouver City Council. During the recent 2005 provincial election he unfortunately lost his bid for MLA by 11 votes. But he had introduced me proudly to his supporters and said “Marc is here to lend his support because he knows I believe in legalization.” And I did not run against him in that riding because Tim is a good man; but again, do you think if there was any taint anywhere in my life that these people would introduce me to crowds of key supporters?<br><br><table align="left"><tbody><tr><td><img vsapce="5" alt="Marc doing what he does best" src="http://www.cannabisculture.com/library/images/uploads/4482-MarcSpeech.jpg" align="right" hspace="5"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="-2"><i>Marc doing what he does best</i></font></td></tr></tbody></table>Adriane Carr is leader of the
 BC Green Party. In 2002, the BC Greens launched a petition drive to get proportional representation on the ballot as a people’s initiative. The BC Greens didn’t have the money, I believed in the cause, so I gave Adrianne Carr $8,000 personally to finance the petition drive. That was seed money. I’ve never had any other source of income.<br><br>I never met a person, government, government agency, politician, tax department, or any charitable or non-governmental agency who ever refused any money from me, even though I was world famous as a marijuana seed seller. Banks opened accounts and issued credit cards, and I was honest and candid with every last one of them.<br><br>Over 10 years, I gave $4,000,000 Canadian to activist organizations, activist politicians, ballot initiatives throughout the United States, referendums, court challenges, Supreme Court of Canada challenges, refugees, bail costs, legal defence funds, political parties, individuals, drug addiction clinics, media,
 medical bills for activists (Terence McKenna, Jack Herer), Compassion Clubs (legal bills and start-up money), Hemp fests, conferences, Global Marijuana Marches (2000 to 2005), full page ads in Canadian newspapers, HEMP BC Legal Assistance Centre... and the list goes on. It’s an extraordinary record of unparalleled distribution of the proceeds from our beloved plant. <br><br>And I never met anyone who complained. Even that last judge who fined me in 1999 for that 1998 seed charge gave a nice speech on my behalf, decrying the drug war.<br><br>Overgrow the Government. Absolutely right. Inherent in that beautiful phrase are so many ideals and glories of a co-operative, peaceful society. Plant the seeds of freedom. Not overthrow, which speaks of violent conflict. But overgrow, using God’s greatest plant, and the enlightenment that comes from ingesting marijuana, to further a peaceful, democratic, revolution based on tolerance and peace and unity of all peoples. Plants, not violence.
 Reason, not murderous incarceration. Personal freedom, not the Nazified paramilitary violence of the DEA.<br><br><img vsapce="5" alt="" src="http://www.cannabisculture.com/library/images/uploads/4482-DEAFlag.jpg" align="right" hspace="5">I am being punished for my success. I have achieved much in my eleven years, but clearly now, the enemy, the very dark and powerful forces emanating from the White House believe they have the upper hand. That they have stopped our revolution. That this is the time when the Bush-Walters White House is making the most aggressive attack on our culture ever, and I don’t mean just on me. The current <i>Rolling Stone</i> talks of the Bush White House and the DEA arresting more Americans than ever before for marijuana, and pursuing us with a frenzy not yet seen in history.<br><br>My wonderful friend Mike Smith last March 2004 received a 30 year sentence in an Oklahoma federal prison for growing 200 plants. He had already spent six years on a previous
 cultivation offence. His wife, Yvonne Toy, received a 15 year sentence, her first offence ever, for those same 200 plants.<br><br>Not comprehensible to the sensitive, rational mind. Why would beautiful people like Yvonne and Mike be given medieval torture like that over marijuana? Why would the taxpayers of America spend a million dollars to make them miserable in a cold unloving and dangerous federal prison? This is madness.<br><br>And so this is my request, this is a challenge. Help me cope through this very difficult period ahead. You know I will try to speak on behalf of our culture with passion, reason and good values. In the months ahead, I will be interviewed extensively, and I hope I am a spokesman and activist and leader you can be proud of.<br><br>Now I live at your pleasure. Any money I use to live on will be charitable donations from people like you. Pot-TV, <i>CC</i> Magazine, the BCMP: they cannot be giving me money. I returned my rented car, moved into a small
 affordable apartment, and am selling my furnishings. I work every day and have no leisure time. <br><br>If you believe that this record of service to our culture merits your support, then I will tell you that we can use your support.<br><br><table align="left"><tbody><tr><td><img vsapce="5" alt="Marc and Michelle at Toke The Vote" src="http://www.cannabisculture.com/library/images/uploads/4482-MarcMichelle.jpg" align="right" hspace="5"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="-2"><i>Marc and Michelle at Toke The Vote</i></font></td></tr></tbody></table>As you know, I am not afraid of jail, I am not afraid to die. But I do not want to see Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams get extradited. Michelle Rainey is the most selfless activist I have ever known. A fantastic woman who daily suffers with Crohns Disease, needs marijuana to control her very damaged and disabled organs, yet has helped hundreds, if not thousands of people with her unrelenting effort to make marijuana
 legal. Michelle has been my greatest ally in this struggle, and she surely should be nominated for Sainthood. She is so worthy of your support. She MUST NOT be extradited to a US jail. She will die in horrible pain there. My American friends, and my Canadian friends, this cannot be permitted to happen. A terrible injustice will have occurred if Michelle Rainey exists in pain and torture in an American jail. There will terrible karma in the world if one of God’s most beautiful souls is allowed to be destroyed by apathy and cowardice in this, her most critical time of need.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

SUPERSTAR DJ KEOKI (yawn)
*OFFICAL NYC PARTY MONSTER TOUR STOP*
*CD RELEASE for KILL THE DJ*
(Nocturnal DJs, www.djkeoki.com - Los Angeles/NYC)
Tonight we bring you something for friday the 13th that is truely 
hardcore in the underground movement.DJ KEOKI. Either loved or hated, 
Keoki is never ignored . . . Keoki is America's own superstar DJ. 
Alongside the stalwarts from across the sea, Keoki stands tall: A 
million records sold. Magazine cover boy. Billboard Dance Chart 
dominator. Cross-country jetsetter. A major musical contributor to a 
cultural phenomenon. A pioneer for dance music in the USA. Keoki is all 
of these things and more. Immersing himself in the growing dance music 
culture inNYC IN 1985, Keoki made a huge impact on dance culture in the 
USA. What Keoki possessed that othersof his era lacked was the 
anarchistic flamboyance and showmanship that accompanied his sublime 
musical creativity. Whereas many DJs could put together solid, 
floor-shaking mixes, Keoki added so much more, and his personal style, 
both in terms of fashion,lifestyle, and music,landed him right in the 
iconic center of the Club Kid movement in the early '90s when Keoki 
maintained a legendary residency at the Disco 2000 night at NYC's 
Limelight.Now touring on the Party Monster tour, supporting the now cult 
classic movie portraying the scandelous occurances at the Limelight and 
touring in support of his new mix CD "KILL THE DJ" get ready to 
experience it all again..
MONEY.SUCCESS.FAME.GLAMOR.


ROB GEE
(Adam Worldwide, AMPT, La Corstra Nostra -NJ)
What Hardcore event would be complete without MR Gee?? Rob's dynamic 
stage presence and floor rocking anthem's have become a staple through 
out the scene. From coast to coast, Europe and back again. Rob Gee
is at the forfront on the Hardcore Gabber movement. Branching out into 
outher areas with his band AMPT featuring members of slipknot & 
Biohazard, there is no turning back now. Rob's also become one of the
big players in the event cordination scene now, making larger massives 
in the northeast take place with a lil' touch O GEE.. to kick it up a 
notch, such as WHISTLE, BANG etc.. See you motherfuckers in the pit.


ADAM X
*Industrial techno Fetish set*
(Sonic Groove - NYC)
LEGEND. No if, and's or but's about it. Adam's flawless mixing, and 
taste in techno has left him a permenant leader in the electronic

techno treo helped form the scene in which we know today, and schooling 
us all to what it truely means to be underground. We are thrilled to 
have Adam at this event, get ready for the unexpected.

(Adrenaline AM, Hidden Dimension - Brooklyn NY)

DJ ICEY - Zone Records/Essential Mix/FFRR Recordings - Orlando
djicey.com

Born and raised in Florida, DJ Icey has been mesmerized by electronic
music ever since hearing the synthesizer breakdown on The Edgar Winter
Group's .Frankenstein". Rising to worldwide prominence out of the
fertile Orlando Florida electronic music scene, Icey cut his teeth at
the legendary EDGE nightclub in the mid-90s. With over 200 12. singles
under his production belt, and playing 100+ gigs per year, Icey is a
touring maniac. But that doesn't keep him out of the studio during the
week working on new tracks for his Labels Zone and Tree records,
constantly trying to push the envelope to make his fans sweat on the
dancefloor.


w/special guests:
DJ KARES - digitalgoodtime.com - Boston

Rapidly becoming a recognizable face in the dance scene, Kares has  been
enamoring partygoers across the United States as her infectious  
positive
attitude envelops dancefloors both big and small when she drops her
signature funky, progressive sound.

Oh my, what a fun time.  The soundsystem at View got a nice workout. You 
shoulda seen the expression on the bar manager's face as the guys were 
doing the soundcheck,  i'm surprised nothing got blown out.

Much drinking of the vodka, much waving of the hands in the air, and 
much of the Akron kids showing up.

see you all next time

Subject: {pb-cle} GODSPIN POSTPONED... :*-(

GODSPIN has been POSTPONED!
OK, the Coach got a phone call yesterday, and I had to take a trip to
Huntington, WV to find out what the Hell's going on. I learned that things have
gone really bad and that I must postpone GODSPIN... I think it's messed up that
it seems I'm the last person to learn what's going on...

In short, when the resident DJ (at the time), the club manager and I made
arrangements to throw our theme party GODSPIN, it was a handshake agreement
(because of a struggling dance scene at the time... we just wanted to get
something going) that was supposed to have been the simpliest party that we've
ever thrown--a small venue, cheap flyers & advertisement, a theme party, and
tons of fun!  Well, within the last few weeks, the resident DJ relocated, and
management/ownership completely changed, leaving me to look like Colin Powell. 
No one's to blame, except the Coach.  Unexpected events occurred that never
crossed my mind and no one properly prepared a counterplan in case something
like this was to happen.  I have been forced to postpone next week's party.

The real owners didn't hang me to dry, though.  They suggested moving the party
about a half mile over, to a location on the Ohio River.  I've been
there--where the party got changed at the last minute and people end up driving
4+ hours to parties to learn that it had been either moved or cancelled.  I'm
not going there because that only makes me look really bad.  So I'm postponing
the party as a result.

I may or may not decide to try to reschedule this event, right now, possibly
April. It all depends on how many lawyers I want to hire, how many contracts
I'm willing to force people to sign & how big of a headache I'm willing to
take...  As for my B-Day party, I think I'm gonna just focus on grad school. I
will throw ONE MORE local party... and just ONE MORE!  I'm starting to get
older...

This that explains why we need contracts, lawyers, and all the unfortunate legal
BS so that these things can be prevented.  It's totally a shame that the Coach
must get legal, political, and anal, but that's life.  House parties are cool,
but the last time I threw one of those, I lost my ass over it because the party
seriously got out of control.  It's also why I don't throw too many parties,
because each party I throw become a headache and I end up having to nearly
strangle someone, no matter how well planned parties tend to be (well-planned
but poorly executed.)

Anyway, enough ranting and raving.  I'm so sorry about this guys.  When I throw
parties, everything's usually legit--nothing shady ever.  I think you guys
acknowledge that by now.  This is the first time that I've actually had to
cancel a party.  It's not cool at all.  Keep in touch & keep it real.  Peace
out.

Sorry about the spam.


Looking for something to do tonight? Check out Chilled Rhythms at Twist,
part of the weekly Snap Back Sundays starting at 4:30 pm. There is a =
make
your own bloody mary bar going on at 1pm and happy hour prices until =
8pm.
Today's party, called Chilled Rhythms features 5 djs each playing 2 hour
sets.=20

NOEL kicks it off at 4:30 with her signature oldschool funk and soul =
sound.
You might know her from WAR or LAVA LOUNGE.

JOSEPH is next on the decks. He was a sunday night resident at =
Metropolis2
during the Tigger era. He also is on Ian Mariano's nspace record label.
Joseph is moving out of Cleveland so this will be his last appearance. =
His
sounds range from dub to drum and bass to trance and house. One of the =
most
dynamic dj's I know!

JAMIE TYLER brings his minimal techno and dare I say micro house sounds =
to
the plate. JAMIE is part of the local production company PLATE TECTONICS =
who
has done events at Abbasso and Touch. His latest mix cd is one of my
favorites in the last couple of months.

NOX is a name that all the ravers should be familiar with and who has
transferred into clubland rather nicely. NOX is known for his disco =
house
sound, but now is known for playing more contemporary house sounds that =
get
a room moving. NOX has been a resident at WISH and STEREO at Metropolis =
and
RITUAL at Moda as well as rocked more parties than I can count!

REESE brings the night to a close. Reese is the Wednesday resident at =
TWIST
and plays mostly an 80's retro sound on Wednesdays. Reese was also a
resident at O2 for a year or so. I'm really not sure what he has in =
store
for us tonight, as he is also versatile and talented dj and is known for
house, psy-trance, and electro/80's stuff. Should be a good close to a =
fun
night!

I also need to mention that Dwreck has put together a fine fine =
WALLPAPER
VISUALS display for us showcasing events all over town during the last =
year
as well as footage from the 10-10 project. If you have been out =
recently,
you have seen WALLPAPER VISUALS doing some truly unique and artistic =
stuff.

Finally, as if that wasn't enough, CMHA is hosting a special private =
party
in the secret basement room inside TWIST from 4pm until 10pm. Special =
guest
dj INBUM CHO from CHICAGO, who rocked Nitty Gritty last night and got
everyone's cellphones blowing up about how they were missing a sick =
show,
will be headlining along with DARREL SOUND, CARA, and MARK STRAUSS. =
KOALA
TEA's ALEX FORTE is providing sound and I'm sure WALLPAPER has some cool
visuals in store using his unique brand of video and FILMS. This is a =
"no
room for squares" party as the room only holds about 50 people so you =
best
be prepared to dance or get pushed out ;) This is word of mouth and =
internet
promotion only, so if you can't find the entrance and want to check it
out... ask someone who looks like they would know!

Diversity is a great teacher, and there is no better university than =
TWIST
which is known for opening its doors to EVERYONE. If it's not your =
thing,
please don't come. Otherwise all are welcome! Twist is on the corner of
117th and Clifton on the Lakewood/Cleveland border.   This is 21+ but =
they
usually only ID at the bar.

Plus... this is 100% FREE!=20

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DNB Liberation 

Well Friday night was a success! Thanks so much to
everyone who came out to support! Thanks to Derek for
the awesome visuals,Tim for taking hot pics for the
mag, and Justin and Paul for coming out before the
show to lend a hand. Also, much thanks to Jess G
,Trevor, George, and all the people who helped me
promote this, I couldn't of pulled it together in two
weeks with out you guys. 

All the acts were insane, the boys had the crowd going
strong until the the lights unfortunately had to come
on at 2:30. The sound was amazing, this show
definitely broke the system in, a perfect spot for dnb
I have to say. The best part about the night is
knowing how much Cleveland appreciated the tour and
how much of a good time everyone had at the show..I do
aploigize for the high drink prices, don't think those
prices will stay that high for long. Again, thanks to
everyone who came out, and of course thanks to the DnB
Liberation Front for giving Cleveland a rocken show! 

Check out these pics from the show, thanks to Trout
and Karli. I will have a complete gallery of the shots
from the show online in about a week at
www.basslinemagazine.com, I will keep everyone posted.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Saturday - 01.21.06 - Pittsburgh, PA

DJ ICEY - Zone Records/Essential Mix/FFRR Recordings - Orlando
djicey.com

Born and raised in Florida, DJ Icey has been mesmerized by electronic
music ever since hearing the synthesizer breakdown on The Edgar Winter
Group's .Frankenstein". Rising to worldwide prominence out of the
fertile Orlando Florida electronic music scene, Icey cut his teeth at
the legendary EDGE nightclub in the mid-90s. With over 200 12. singles
under his production belt, and playing 100+ gigs per year, Icey is a
touring maniac. But that doesn't keep him out of the studio during the
week working on new tracks for his Labels Zone and Tree records,
constantly trying to push the envelope to make his fans sweat on the
dancefloor.


w/special guests:
DJ KARES - digitalgoodtime.com - Boston

Rapidly becoming a recognizable face in the dance scene, Kares has  been
enamoring partygoers across the United States as her infectious  
positive
attitude envelops dancefloors both big and small when she drops her
signature funky, progressive sound.

Wednesday 1/4, through jan:
Every wednesday in January is blue collar worker night! We are featuring 
an extremely laid back atmosphere with none other than draft PBR on 
special! It's only $2.00 for a PBR draft and here is the cool thing, you 
get to keep the PBR pint glass that it comes in and refills are only 
$1.50. Need I say more, no, but I will...we will also have our famous 
grilled cheese on special for $1.50 and our great collection of board 
games at you disposal for your entertainment. What a night! Oh, and only 
$6 dollar draft pitchers of PBR so bring your friends.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings sci-fi fans!

For about $25, you too can join in the geek-fest that is the Case 
Western Reserve University Sci-Fi Movie Marathon. It's held in the 
Strosacker Audiotium on the south end of campus, just a stone's throw 
from the always-under-construction Adelbert Bridge. Here's the info per 
Brooke, one of the Film Society co-directors:

Friday January 20th
8:00pm The Island (2005)
10:30pm The Tingler (1959)

Saturday January 21st
12:15am Surprise I
3:15am Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959)
6:00am The Brother from Another Planet (1984)
8:00am War Games (1983)
10:00am Surprise II
12:15pm Mystery Science Theater: 3000 The Movie (1996)
1:45pm THX 1138 (1971)
3:15pm Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)
5:15pm Surprise III
8:15pm King Kong (1933)
10:15pm Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)


Sunday January 22nd
12:15am The Dark Crystal (1982)
2:00am The Incredibles (2004)


everyone should bring their sleeping bags and show up! its exciting!
for those of you who are freshman or have never been, you pay $25 (the 
cost decreases as the night progresses, so the last movie is $3) at the 
begining and you get a wrist band. you can either stay in strosacker for 
the entire weekend or you can go back to your dorm and sleep and do 
hygeine things and then come back. We are the oldest science fiction 
marathon in the nation and people come from all over the country- its a 
HUGE event. we have food delivered every four hours- so just be sure to 
bring a comfy sweatshirt, your laptop, magic cards, and monster manuals, 
and get ready for a weekend of sci-fi, fantasy, and general geeking out!

Didn't take that many since I forgot to charge my batteries.  Aside from
the lack of heat and abundance of house towards the beginning, was a
good night.  Saw cops around all night but didn't break it up or anything.

Funny, I heard like two tracks all night that I would call house by today's

Yeah, and I know a lot of people that are like that because of all  
the crappy "house" that gets played around akron nowadays.  Although  
since there's been that dj battle at annabell's all these other  
people are coming out of the woodwork.

House has become one of these all encompassing genres, like how  
everything is techno until you break it up into house, trance, jungle/ 
dnb, hardcore, etc.  Generally I don't care for much in the house  
"branch" of music, and even though you were probably that there were  
only a few plain ol' vanilla house tracks played, but there was still  
a lot of stuff played that would still be placed under house more  
than any of the other big genres out there (I'm thinking House,  
Trance, Techno, Hardcore or Jungle/DnB)  But like shag-e's set was  
breaks, which I guess falls into the House genre, and that set was  
ok, and then andy james and trout afterwards was what finally got me  
moving... aside from just trying to stay warm :)

Hope that all doesn't come out as being too negative, I still had a  
good time there and I think it would have been nice if they had more  
parties there, like when it gets warmer out.  It's nice to go to new  
places aside from the same two or three bars or just hanging out at  
someone's house. but I guess they're going to demolish that place  
sometime soon.

breaks is not house. expect a spanish inquisition from the breakbeat nazi.

only house i really heard was booty house, which i kinda lump under 
techno (file under funny, yet bad).  well then danny after me with the 
garriage which i guess falls under the house umbrella sorta but not really.

i wish you could break it down to:
1. good shit
2. shit

but that gets pretty subjective, but thats kinda what i do in my head.

> and then andy james and trout afterwards was what finally got me

yes, i do rock.  some dumb fuck did ask me to spin breaks, but i guess 
if its all house?

> aside from just trying to stay warm :)

i managed to stay warm  :)

Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as

  Sorry, let me clarify more.  Here's what Wikipedia has to say...
   
  Breakbeat (sometimes breakbeats or breaks) is a term used to describe a collection of sub-genres of electronic music, usually characterized by the use of a non-straighted 4/4 drum pattern (as opposed to the steady beat of house or trance). These rhythms may be characterised by their use of syncopation and polyrhythms, which are prominent in all music of African origin, including much Afro-American music.
   
  So what's the difference then?  The samples used in breaks?  So you're saying Aux 88 doesn't produce breaks music, just breakbeat music?

wikipedia =/= not reliable source

Especially in this case, where it's dead wrong.


Again, I reiterate:

http://www.djentropy.com/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&artid=21


Breaks and Breakbeat are two seperate things actually. Breaks, in  
electronic music terms, isn't a form of Breakbeat. Breakbeat can use  
Breaks (which may be beats), but it gets it's name from something  
different. There is a lot of crossover though [by DJs though].

Breaks got it's name from BREAKDOWNS of other tunes, namely house and  
hip-hop. In the early 80's, DJ's would spin and juggle just the BREAKDOWN  
of the song where it was JUST the beat, or just the beat and one sound, or  
just the beat and the bass, and breakdancers would dance to that.  
Breakdancing doesn't refer to "Dancing to the Breakbeat", it means:  
"Dancing to the breakDOWN"...

So then what is Breakbeat? Breakbeat refers to a *broken beat* used in a  
way to make a new rhythm. For example: Jungle/DNB is a form of Breakbeat,  
as is old skool Hardcore, some new skool UK Hardcore, some Nu Skool  
Breaks, some 2-step Garage, etc...

The big difference these days lies in production techniques, and where the  
music is rooted. For example, Funky Breaks are BREAKS, but they are not  
Breakbeat. Why? Because they are programmed beats, made on a drum machine,  
and are rooted in BREAKDOWNS of tunes, not in the actual beats. Go listen  
to Curtis Blow's song from the early 80's: "These Are The Breaks!', which  
refers to extending the breakdown of the song in order to dance to. (The  
song is 4/4) Funky Breaks derive from BREAKDOWNS of House tunes, and share  
some things with hip-hop, but have originally have more to do with House.  
House used to (and still does, occassionally) have BREAKDOWNS that would  
go into a non-4/4 beat, and Funky Breaks were derived mostly from that.

Breakbeat is formed by taking beats that are broken (and 99% of the time  
played by human drummers), and looping them, and/or cutting them up,  
and/or using the groove that the human played to make a drum track or a  
new beat. (production stuff, ie: ReCycle! or WaveSurgeon) For example,  
taking the Amen beat, and looping it, is Breakbeat, but programming a  
similiar beat on a 909 is Breaks.

There is a lot of crossover still, with music like Nu Skool Breaks  
incorporating both Breaks and Breakbeat, and 97-99 style two-step (not  
2-step) jungle/DNB, which strayed far away from it's Breakbeat roots, and  
began to use non-human played beats that were programmed on a drum machine  
or sequencer.

But there is a difference, and the words aren't exchangable, but the  
difference is easy to remember:

909, 808, 606, drum machine = BREAKS (Funky Breaks, Trance Breaks, 80's  
Freestyle, Electro, Acid Breaks, etc)

Sampled (99% of the time human-played) beats, or beats made with human  
played grooves = BREAKBEAT (Jungle/DNB, old skool UK Hardcore, new skool  
UK "happy" Hardcore (which almost ALWAYS has breakbeat underlying the  
kick, if there is one, as it derives from old skool Hardcore along with  
Jungle/DNB), some 2-step Garage, some Nu Skool Breaks, Trip Hop, etc)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} House

Wikipedia also has a more accurate definition of breakdancing.

Wikipedia is indeed not always correct, but it does represent an
amalgamation of the currently accepted / debated views on subjects.
The more popular the subject the more views come in to play, and the
more accurate / complete the wikipedia entry becomes. Being an
amalgamation of views, it's inherantly more likely to be correct than
the view of 1 individual. When that 1 individual is known to
self-profess absolute superiority with far fetched claims of being the
#1 DJ and / or #1 Producer, their credibility is even further eroded.

You're saying that the only difference between the two is in what instrument is used to create them?

So two loops that are the same rhythmically fall into different genres simply because one is produced by a precise live drummer and the other is produced by a quantized drum machine?

wikipedia =/= not reliable source

Especially in this case, where it's dead wrong.


Again, I reiterate:

http://www.djentropy.com/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&artid=21


Breaks and Breakbeat are two seperate things actually. Breaks, in  
electronic music terms, isn't a form of Breakbeat. Breakbeat can use  
Breaks (which may be beats), but it gets it's name from something  
different. There is a lot of crossover though [by DJs though].

Breaks got it's name from BREAKDOWNS of other tunes, namely house and  
hip-hop. In the early 80's, DJ's would spin and juggle just the BREAKDOWN  
of the song where it was JUST the beat, or just the beat and one sound, or  
just the beat and the bass, and breakdancers would dance to that.  
Breakdancing doesn't refer to "Dancing to the Breakbeat", it means:  
"Dancing to the breakDOWN"...

So then what is Breakbeat? Breakbeat refers to a *broken beat* used in a  
way to make a new rhythm. For example: Jungle/DNB is a form of Breakbeat,  
as is old skool Hardcore, some new skool UK Hardcore, some Nu Skool  
Breaks, some 2-step Garage, etc...

The big difference these days lies in production techniques, and where the  
music is rooted. For example, Funky Breaks are BREAKS, but they are not  
Breakbeat. Why? Because they are programmed beats, made on a drum machine,  
and are rooted in BREAKDOWNS of tunes, not in the actual beats. Go listen  
to Curtis Blow's song from the early 80's: "These Are The Breaks!', which  
refers to extending the breakdown of the song in order to dance to. (The  
song is 4/4) Funky Breaks derive from BREAKDOWNS of House tunes, and share  
some things with hip-hop, but have originally have more to do with House.  
House used to (and still does, occassionally) have BREAKDOWNS that would  
go into a non-4/4 beat, and Funky Breaks were derived mostly from that.

Breakbeat is formed by taking beats that are broken (and 99% of the time  
played by human drummers), and looping them, and/or cutting them up,  
and/or using the groove that the human played to make a drum track or a  
new beat. (production stuff, ie: ReCycle! or WaveSurgeon) For example,  
taking the Amen beat, and looping it, is Breakbeat, but programming a  
similiar beat on a 909 is Breaks.

There is a lot of crossover still, with music like Nu Skool Breaks  
incorporating both Breaks and Breakbeat, and 97-99 style two-step (not  
2-step) jungle/DNB, which strayed far away from it's Breakbeat roots, and  
began to use non-human played beats that were programmed on a drum machine  
or sequencer.

But there is a difference, and the words aren't exchangable, but the  
difference is easy to remember:

909, 808, 606, drum machine = BREAKS (Funky Breaks, Trance Breaks, 80's  
Freestyle, Electro, Acid Breaks, etc)

Sampled (99% of the time human-played) beats, or beats made with human  
played grooves = BREAKBEAT (Jungle/DNB, old skool UK Hardcore, new skool  
UK "happy" Hardcore (which almost ALWAYS has breakbeat underlying the  
kick, if there is one, as it derives from old skool Hardcore along with  
Jungle/DNB), some 2-step Garage, some Nu Skool Breaks, Trip Hop, etc)

i agree with a lot entropy said but i think its a bit
too technical... breaks came from break downs. drum
sets or a drum machine can replicate break downs and
still be considered breaks because each tool is being
manipulated by a human. breaks and breakbeat are the
same. ones a slang way of saying it. broken beats are
different all together.

well now we're comparing wedding djs vs rave djs.  that's a whole  
other argument right there.

...let's see how many different arguments we can get going... in the  
same thread... without changing the subject.  So far we're at breaks  
vs breakbeat, vinyl vs cd, and wedding djs vs rave djs

I think some of the purists are going to be disappointed to know, that  
plenty of "real" djs play weddings too, since there's good money in it.   So I for

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} House

I'm starting a new night here in Pgh and I am only going to be booking DJs 
that can play on both Vinyl and CDs, DJ's who play like 'wedding DJs'... a 
total mashup night with Classic Rock, Indie Rock, 80's Metal and Hip hop and 
some funk, soul, and house.  After every three songs you better change 
genres or I'm kicking you out ...

let's argue about that.

on side note:  Thursdays @ Havana is now going to be called 'Blood on the 
Dancefloor' with Kelly Carter kicking off the first night next week.  Curt 
Jackson and Ashwin Tumne will be our new bouncers.  Jwan is not allowed to 
spin any more Green Velvet or Bjork.  Ask them for the details.

:P

Subject: {pb-cle} 3 NEW RELEASES FROM EXPERIMEDIA

3 NEW RELEASES FROM EXPERIMEDIA
www.experimedia.net
Catalog : http://experimedia.net/catalog


EXP033 - BELL LABS - PROGRESSIVE INNOVATIONS EP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D110

Tibbar says - The Progressive Innovations EP by Bell Labs is without a
doubt some of the most sparse, spooky sounding electro this particular
writer has ever heard. I found myself very uncomfortable listening to
this which, in this instance, is a pretty good thing. Very simplistic
at points, reminding one of some of Mouse On Mars or Matmos' earlier
works, this little EP is chock full of some slowly mutating, dancey
goodness. You will find that you never know quite what to think or
expect with this recording. That is really its most outstanding
quality, its inability to be nailed down or figured out. When you DO
hear things that resemble sounds from the outside world, it's like a
welcome guest come for tea. All in all, a very curious & interesting
debut that leaves one curious about a sophomore release.

jbible says - Its Wednesday evening and you are hanging out at the
local mall arcade that your friend works at while tripping on LSD. You
are losing track of what you were doing while playing your unlimited
free games and selling acid out of the back room. Shivers down your
spine, moving lights and colors all around, and a nervous paranoid
twitch. The obnoxious elitist video game geek with the gimp hand that
never leaves is banging away on the Tekken console eating up little
kids quarters. You just woke up at 5pm and are trying to kill time
until the weekend arrives when its time to hit the road headed to the
next big rave with your caravan of shady buddies looking to score, get
high, dance, and hustle.

EXP032 - FIELDTRIQP - FADED EP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D109

Fieldtriqp returns to Experimedia with a complete 180 from his
previous EP 'People Damage' (Retropublik). Instead of more aggressive
rythms and faster paced songs, this EP boasts the kind of subtlety and
nuance that long-term Fieldtriqp fans are sure to welcome. Opening
with the epic 9 minute track "Faded With The Sun" (the EP's namesake),
these 6 tracks usher in the most beautiful melodies this artist has
ever graced us with. What is presented during the course of these 30
minutes is (and this statement is not taken lightly, mind you) on par
with SAW 2 in terms of beauty, quality, inspiration, and
accomplishment. Mostly percussion-less, mostly slow-going, this EP
will put you in a Nyquil coma. Fieldtriqp has reached a new plateau of
sonic mastery with this release.

EXP031 - THE JACK BOHLEN BOOK CLUB - 1979 LP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D108

A dense ultra-minimalist approach to ambience perfectly blending
meticulous sound design and field recording. Distant voices and faint
commotion emerge softly from gentle static and tones. Touches of
slowly morphing melodies get sprinkled in along the way originating
from various organic and synthetic sources. The album in its whole
creates a truly unique melancholic experience perfect for those rainy
Sunday afternoons and late nights. Falling asleep during a late night
marathon of The Twilight Zone. Three in the morning at the abandoned
warehouse. Two way radio interference delivering snippets of
indecipherable conversation. The midnight hum from a nearby airport. A
truly beautiful album intended not only for the sole purpose of
listening...but of experiencing. Preferably in complete darkness and
isolation where this album is sure to have its most profound effect.

Heh, both post at around the same time, but meghan's one still

gt; Especially in this case, where it's dead wrong.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;=
 Again, I reiterate:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; <a href=3D"http://www.djentropy.com/mo=
dules/sections/index.php?op=3Dviewarticle&amp;artid=3D21">
http://www.djentropy.com/modules/sections/index.php?op=3Dviewarticle&amp;ar=
tid=3D21</a><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Breaks and Breakbeat are two seperate =
things actually. Breaks, in<br>&gt; electronic music terms, isn't a form of=
 Breakbeat. Breakbeat can use
<br>&gt; Breaks (which may be beats), but it gets it's name from something<=
br>&gt; different. There is a lot of crossover though [by DJs though].<br>&=
gt;<br>&gt; Breaks got it's name from BREAKDOWNS of other tunes, namely hou=
se and
<br>&gt; hip-hop. In the early 80's, DJ's would spin and juggle just the BR=
EAKDOWN<br>&gt; of the song where it was JUST the beat, or just the beat an=
d one sound,<br>&gt; or<br>&gt; just the beat and the bass, and breakdancer=
s would dance to that.
<br>&gt; Breakdancing doesn't refer to &quot;Dancing to the Breakbeat&quot;=
, it means:<br>&gt; &quot;Dancing to the breakDOWN&quot;...<br>&gt;<br>&gt;=
 So then what is Breakbeat? Breakbeat refers to a *broken beat* used in a
<br>&gt; way to make a new rhythm. For example: Jungle/DNB is a form of Bre=
akbeat,<br>&gt; as is old skool Hardcore, some new skool UK Hardcore, some =
Nu Skool<br>&gt; Breaks, some 2-step Garage, etc...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The big=
 difference these days lies in production techniques, and where
<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; music is rooted. For example, Funky Breaks are BREAKS,=
 but they are not<br>&gt; Breakbeat. Why? Because they are programmed beats=
, made on a drum<br>&gt; machine,<br>&gt; and are rooted in BREAKDOWNS of t=
unes, not in the actual beats. Go listen
<br>&gt; to Curtis Blow's song from the early 80's: &quot;These Are The Bre=
aks!', which<br>&gt; refers to extending the breakdown of the song in order=
 to dance to. (The<br>&gt; song is 4/4) Funky Breaks derive from BREAKDOWNS=
 of House tunes, and
<br>&gt; share<br>&gt; some things with hip-hop, but have originally have m=
ore to do with House.<br>&gt; House used to (and still does, occassionally)=
 have BREAKDOWNS that would<br>&gt; go into a non-4/4 beat, and Funky Break=
s were derived mostly from that.
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Breakbeat is formed by taking beats that are broken (and 9=
9% of the time<br>&gt; played by human drummers), and looping them, and/or =
cutting them up,<br>&gt; and/or using the groove that the human played to m=
ake a drum track or a
<br>&gt; new beat. (production stuff, ie: ReCycle! or WaveSurgeon) For exam=
ple,<br>&gt; taking the Amen beat, and looping it, is Breakbeat, but progra=
mming a<br>&gt; similiar beat on a 909 is Breaks.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There is =
a lot of crossover still, with music like Nu Skool Breaks
<br>&gt; incorporating both Breaks and Breakbeat, and 97-99 style two-step =
(not<br>&gt; 2-step) jungle/DNB, which strayed far away from it's Breakbeat=
 roots, and<br>&gt; began to use non-human played beats that were programme=
d on a drum
<br>&gt; machine<br>&gt; or sequencer.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But there is a diffe=
rence, and the words aren't exchangable, but the<br>&gt; difference is easy=

My PC running FL Studio is way better than your mac running Reason...

And they're BOTH better than spending all that money on actual hardware synths..

But ALL THREE are better than learning to play a guitar or a violin or something like that.  Non-electronic instruments are so last millenium.

Subject: {pb-cle} cd burning opinions...

hey peeps long time no talk... greetings from the
Caribbean.

I have a slew of audio CD's to burn... it's the
classic question... does burn speed really effect
sound quality and to what degree. I'm sure we talked
about this back in the day but I could use some
opinions. Is it really worth making the job that much
more difficult to burn at 4X??? 

~AA~ "I'm on island time!!!"

i've always found it's the quality of the cdr that affects the cd.  i dont
know whether it actually affects the sound quality, but some of the cheap
cheap cd's often have problems playing in some players, and even in players
that they will play, sometimes you get seek problems, recuing problems if
you're using them on a dj cd-deck (they will just sometimes hang while
trying to seek to a position), so i typically stick with Sony cdr's because
i have yet to have playback problems with them.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} cd burning opinions...

The only way it can sound anything other than perfect is if you're
getting bit errors.

Are you getting bit errors? There are 4 factors really.

1 Quality of the disk you're using - how fast can it change phase (be recor=
ded).
2 Quality of the recorder you're using - how fast can it force a
particular disk to change phase.
3 Compatibility between the lasers in your drive and the disk type /
color you're using.
4 Ability to deliver data to your drive fast enough.

If this is a PC based setup, it's easy to test if you'll have bit
errors on audio, just burn a data CD using the same media and drive
and use the verify option.

Even with a few bit errors over the disk, it'd be impossible to hear
at 44 thousand samples (x 16 bits x 2 channels) per second.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} cd burning opinions...

Spin speed shouldn't be that big a deal, but if you are worried about any inaccuracies your burner may have, I'd chuck it and get a high end plextor. They write to the cd from multiple heads fixing any drift the head may have going from the inside to the outside of the CD. 

Ed's got it right too, the media is more than likely the biggest factor in burning. If you do your research, you'll find that there are a half dozen types of chemicals they use for the disc surface (which is actually the top), some are better suited for different things, like archiving.

The dilly with the Sony CD's is that there is a protective coating on the label side of the disc. Cheaper discs have the substrate applied directly to label side of the disc, leaving the label side exposed to all sorts of damage. If said chemicals flake off, no Dr. Scratchfix or wtfever its called will fix it.

Wee!

hey peeps long time no talk... greetings from the
Caribbean.

I have a slew of audio CD's to burn... it's the
classic question... does burn speed really effect
sound quality and to what degree. I'm sure we talked
about this back in the day but I could use some
opinions. Is it really worth making the job that much
more difficult to burn at 4X???

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} cd burning opinions...

I usually just get whatever media is on sale/free.  I probably have a
few hundred blank cd-rs laying around.  But yeah, the speed you burn it
at has little to do with the speed you can play it at.  You can burn a
cd at 4x and throw it in a 48x reader and it will be fine.  Although
also the drives slow down the rotation speed if the disc is off balance
or something when reading them.  The chemicals from the limited research
I've done shows that, for the most part, they are all pretty much the
same with very minor differences.  Like once chemical makeup was
designed to be more compatible with older readers, another one is
supposed to support burning at faster speeds, others are supposed to
last longer, etc.  The big thing to do is to not label them directly on
the disc but on a label, even if it's just a blank white label.  That
label side is where all the data is stored, so protecting that side is
important.  That's why if we ever burn something temporarily to a disc
at work, after we're done I'll scratch at the label with a pair or
scissors or something so it can't be read.  Could also just throw it one
of those industrial grade shredders, just wear eye protection or don't
stand directly in front of it :)

Cheaper discs have the substrate applied directly to label side of the disc, leaving the label side exposed to all sorts of damage. If said chemicals flake off, no Dr. Scratchfix or wtfever its called will fix it.

That's cause there's no raves to talk about anymore, at least in the
pb-cle area.  Unless you extend that towards the outskirts of the area

Subject: {pb-cle} Psy-Tektonics

My apologies for anyone who tried to come out to
Psy-tektonics Saturday. The venue owner did not inform
us that he was canceling our night until we
got there to set up. I guess they are closing the
place and he booked a private party to make
some last minute cash.

It was fun while it lasted.


We are looking for another venue to possibly continue
in the future.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} aquasky mini-mix, 153 tunes in 5 minutes!

I think I've decided that I really don't like the new-school
HHC...(cheesecore?)  theres no real beat! It seems like people dont
really dance to it but more just jump around. I only marginally liked
the oldschool stuff with the fast hard beat. I think I'm a candy kid
at heart that likes Jungle/Gabber/Oldschool and minimalist techno. I
just go to the HHC events for the vibe. I'm pretty psyched about
TogetherAsOne on the 11th cause it'll have 5 rooms and I can play out
all of my techno-multiple-personalities. I'm bummed that DJ Hype is
going to be in toronto on the 18th though because he's my hero and I
dont think I'll be able to handle back to back toronto weekends. It's
also the suck that that gabber event is on the 11th. Too many parties
not enough time... Who says no one raves in PBCLE?
