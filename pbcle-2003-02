Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tonight at havana

all i have to say on this is is that i have been
spinning at/going to havana regularly for about 2.5
years and i have never had a problem, and i know that
recently especially i look like some dirty punk-rocker
or something, and that has never been an issue. also i
work in another local bar with what some would call
expensive drinks and i know when getting a more
expensive liquer added you pay the "shot" price, added
to the well price. havana is definitely one of my
favorite places to spin or just to chill and drink. my
only gripe is that they don't have enough beers, but
since they got sierra i'm happy.
jus my opinion.

Ill take a Tom Cox mix set over pretty much any typical dj set.  At least I know there will be surprises.  Something that will make me stop the hypnotic knod trap, pick up my head, and actually notice there is a DJ mixing.  You think anyone notices you when it sounds almost exactly the same for an hour.  NO!  We dont notice you and we dont care!  Surprise me!  If you dont then your just boring and typical and I dont care how well you beat match.  Its not that hard to beat match when the songs were produced specifically for a DJ to mix with another track.  Take your DJ friendly music and shove it!

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

First off, if you live anywhere near Cleveland and you're not sure what =
you're doing tonight, you now dont have to worry about it because =
absolutely nothing up there tonight could rival what you would see at =
Seiji's Touch appearance.

Last night:  Tom and Jwan show up ~9:45. Bullshit/drink till we Head to =
club ~10:40.  TJ is spinning with Don Carlos giving a little assistance. =
 Great tracks being laid down.  Titonton spins his part, great breakbeat =
goodness, absolutely no complaints on either guy's track selection, they =
definately set a great vibe mood for the evening.

Seiji is, well... how should i put this?...very in touch with his crowd, =
very in touch with his music, and definately very in touch with his =
mixing.  He laid down the hot shit for about 2 hours straight.  Towards =
the end of his set he dropped this wicked ass minimal hip hop that =
sounded better than any Neptunes beat I've ever heard.  I cant say =
enough about how much this definately was in my top 3 all time =
performances I've seen, if not even the best.  If you want to see =
something you definately wont get much of in this area, go to see Seiji =
tonight at Touch, you will not be dissapointed, it is the furthest from =
boring mixing that you will come across. =20

Crowd comments:  It was good to see a very strong showing there, i cant =
even estimate the number of heads that were there.  It was also good =
seeing all the old school heads i hadnt seen in 2-3 years.  Good music =
has a way to bring people out of the woodwork. =20

nah don't do that, what you have to do is make a file with a .m3u
extension (like playlist.m3u).  then put the http url of the actual mp3
file in there.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Review: Cols, Seiji

seiji and titonton were off the hook. they were just playing silly
shit off the CDRs, tracks that sound like they came from fucking
jupiter or some shit. seiji is a fucking ill deejay for sure, he
played all kinds of shit from some detroit broken techno to some
house to some fucking retarded broken beat shit that was just
insane. i liked what they did to that little part of the former
red zone. i wish the dance floor could have been bigger though, as
it was it was only a skinny longish area too close to the bar so
that mad people were walking through it the whole time. and the
goose was an excellent host, even hooking up the grey goose and
that lime shit before we headed out to the club. big ups mike
salamon and all the columbus techno crew, titonton ed luna, etc.

Subject: {pb-cle} vestax mixer repairs

is there a place in the pb-cle that does mixer repairs? I bought a 
pmc-17a and it's in shitty shape, but since I really like it I'd like to 
get it fixed up.

or maybe someone has some vestax parts they'd wanna get rid of, I need 
some 60mm faders and a crossfader.

--------
Maybe people have more important things to worry about now rather than
supporting the rave scene. People are growing up, getting educated and 
looking to find a good job. Its not the 90's anymore man.

i dont remember ratana trainwrecking anything, if he did, i wouldnt have a
point.  i have seen him wreck but not that night.  and who doesnt know the
tracks you played that night?  you both were walking around saying, they
just dont know.  they do know, walkingstick plays the same tracks every
week in pittsburgh not to mention all the old school dnb mix cdz everyone
has. i dont think there is much i could say that would work myself out the
revolving door, im one of the few in town that is contributing original
music to the scene and i can think of ten djs off the top of my head that
have dropped my tunes.  id say im pretty secure here in the 412, no need
to brown nose.

hey if you say so, considering the fact that people trainspotted 
tunes that were way too obvious. anyway, the point of playing old 
school tracks is to trot out the shit people should like. i have 
plenty of non-anthem old school shit, but whats the point? we 
hammered anthem after anthem for a reason. to prove that old music 
doesnt get bad if its great music in the first place.

you cant prove it by me. anyway, i dont really know if someone 
playing your jungle tunes is something to be proud of or not, 
considering the musical taste of nearly every jungle deejay.

flattering to hear them drop my bits.  its seems to me that you dont even
respect your own taste, or were you just brown nosing.  i dont know im
confused. ill catch up with you lata tom, ill be away from my comp for a
bit.

shitbrick, you forgot to mention the Gumby's pizza i ordered when we were
tired and ready to grub when we got back, the porn you tuned in on the big
screen, and the iced tea that gave you some caffeine help this morning.

-Goose

PS the preemptive retort to those who say it's 'shitbreak' from american
pie, not shitbrick:  shitbrick means a brick of shit, like a cute pet name
for someone who think's they're the shit all the time.  shitbreak as a pet
name means you gotta stop what you are doing and take a shitbreak all the
time.  union workers are usually both.

First off, if you live anywhere near Cleveland and you're not sure what
you're doing tonight, you now dont have to worry about it because absolutely
nothing up there tonight could rival what you would see at Seiji's Touch
appearance.

Last night:  Tom and Jwan show up ~9:45. Bullshit/drink till we Head to club
~10:40.  TJ is spinning with Don Carlos giving a little assistance.  Great
tracks being laid down.  Titonton spins his part, great breakbeat goodness,
absolutely no complaints on either guy's track selection, they definately
set a great vibe mood for the evening.

Seiji is, well... how should i put this?...very in touch with his crowd,
very in touch with his music, and definately very in touch with his mixing.
He laid down the hot shit for about 2 hours straight.  Towards the end of
his set he dropped this wicked ass minimal hip hop that sounded better than
any Neptunes beat I've ever heard.  I cant say enough about how much this
definately was in my top 3 all time performances I've seen, if not even the
best.  If you want to see something you definately wont get much of in this
area, go to see Seiji tonight at Touch, you will not be dissapointed, it is
the furthest from boring mixing that you will come across.

Crowd comments:  It was good to see a very strong showing there, i cant even
estimate the number of heads that were there.  It was also good seeing all
the old school heads i hadnt seen in 2-3 years.  Good music has a way to
bring people out of the woodwork.

Something I came across today that I have a feeling quite a few of you =
would be interested in listening to.

Evanescence =3D Tori Amos meets Linkin Park meets Massive Attack.

That's about the best way I can explain it.  It's kinda all over the =
place with going from rocking out to being completely pussied out.  If =
you're into lots of Tori Amos-esque vocals, then you'd probably like =
this album.  In addition to the Origin LP, a single "Bring me to Life" =
is on the Daredevil soundtrack.  My favorite tracks off the album are =
"Whisper" and "Away from Me"

I'm a retard and let my domain registration run out on =
dredwinrodgers.com and am too lazy to renew it tonight, but you can grab =
the full album off my website... or for those of you on my slsk, and =
like looking at my completely unorganized file library, it's on there =
too.  Email me if you want the link.

yes they have raped people for long enough, and when it is coming back to =

it is extremely messed up that they are seriously abusing the use of =

i mean are you telling me that someone can copyright something and have =

that is ridiculous, and insane..

i value artists determination these dayz to make something creative, (even =

the value of that product is up to the individual, and if people willfully =

but me, i stick to my independent producer colleagues most of all, bc they =
produce the best music, the best selection, the best open design of tracks =
and sell them cheaper than the industry.

oh, the joy of computers, and if they come out full force with palladium =

Subject: {pb-cle} making everyone happy was: tonight at havana

Sorry for not repsonding right away - no e-mail on the weekends.

Anyway - to the people who were offended on Thursday Night - next time you 
are in - find me (ask any bartender who I am) - introduce yourself to me and 
I'll buy you a drink.  That goes for anyone else on this list that I don't 
know - come in - meet me and have a drink on me.

We try to make Thursday Nights @ Havana one of the best nights in Pittsburgh 
for good music, good people and _especially_ good vibes.

I'm not saying we were right and you were wrong (I didn't know about this 
situation until today) but I'm sure the guy in question was the barback and 
probably did make the mistake.  I will say this though - no one behind the 
bar at Havana really judges anybody.  Our bartenders do have alot of 
attitude though and can be a bit rough sometimes (the bar is small and it 
gets three deep with people screaming orders sometimes)

Anyway - it is the people that have made Thursdays@Havana last as long as it 
has.

It's your decision - if you feel too offended to come back then I apologize 
... if not - I expect you to introduce yourself to me next time (I'm usually 
standing be the door greeting people as they walk in) and we'll have a drink 
together.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: making everyone happy was: tonight at havana

Thanks Jason, that is a very kind gesture.

If you've read the followups you'll see that I realized I might have 
overreacted some.

I hope to meet you soon.

Keep up the good work.

Sorry for not repsonding right away - no e-mail on the weekends.

Anyway - to the people who were offended on Thursday Night - next time you 
are in - find me (ask any bartender who I am) - introduce yourself to me and 
I'll buy you a drink.  That goes for anyone else on this list that I don't 
know - come in - meet me and have a drink on me.

We try to make Thursday Nights @ Havana one of the best nights in Pittsburgh 
for good music, good people and _especially_ good vibes.

I'm not saying we were right and you were wrong (I didn't know about this 
situation until today) but I'm sure the guy in question was the barback and 
probably did make the mistake.  I will say this though - no one behind the 
bar at Havana really judges anybody.  Our bartenders do have alot of 
attitude though and can be a bit rough sometimes (the bar is small and it 
gets three deep with people screaming orders sometimes)

Anyway - it is the people that have made Thursdays@Havana last as long as it 
has.

It's your decision - if you feel too offended to come back then I apologize 
... if not - I expect you to introduce yourself to me next time (I'm usually 
standing be the door greeting people as they walk in) and we'll have a drink 
together.

Jason C.
Havana

Yeah dude,

Last time I was there I walked in and he immediately got me a beer.

It was one of the coolest things that has ever happened to me.

My life just gets better every week.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} Seiji's performance @ Nitty Gritty

Hey crew...

I wanted to say thanks to all the heads that showed up for Nitty Gritty last Saturday at Touch in Cleveland. The party was definitely bumpin till almost 3AM. Seiji dropped some crazy beats for almost 2 hours and 40 minutes! I had the pleasure of catching him in Columbus before I brought him up for last Saturday's Nitty Gritty gig. He brought the funk both times. I also wanted to say how much I appreciate everyone supporting the quality shows in Columbus and Cleveland. You all have helped make Nitty Gritty a success. We're coming up on our year anniversary in April and we can't tell you how much we look forward to the party each month. 

Hope to see you all at Nitty Gritty Sat March 1st for Romanowski (Future Primitive Sound, San Francisco)!

Time to do some domain registering, I'll sell it back to you for $500 :) 
Or maybe I'll point it to some porno site, or a site with 50 popup windows

Subject: {pb-cle} Hey PB-Clevelanders...

Hey everyone I was thinking of throwing a party for us in April.  In the 
tradition of what I usually do I wanna keep it cheap as possible for 
everyone. Unless I can find a headliner and keep admission between 5-10 bux 
it will all be local and regional acts. I'm looking at a three room venue so 
I want your input on who you wanna see or any ideas you have that will make 
it special.

I'd like to see BigLeagueChew from Toronto, but I haven't heard much
about him lately. He wouldn't be THAT much.
 
I'd also like to see Kevin from Downlow spin another Hip-Hop set like he
did at Luke's party in the Cell. Fucking DOPE.
 
I'd like to see Adam Bomb on a big system.
 
How about going back in time and maybe bribing Frank CountZero to do a
psytrance set?
 
Dan Curtain would be nice and probably not too expensive.(lives in Cle)
 
Dr. Cutups.when was the last time he was in/around Cle/Ak?
 
Just my 2 cents.

Subject: {pb-cle} Soulseek...

I am hearing Soulseek got shut down.

Though this is all second hand... but from people who normally don't joke 
around...

If this is true, we may have a national crisis on our hands.

Has anybody heard anything?

What a horrible night to have a curse.
               - Simon Belmont

d'oh, I actually delayed my drive home so that I could at least hear 
the first part of this and he didn't come on until 11:00, by then I 
was home with some other station playing.  That's what sucks, i can't 
get a signal amplifier, because it will be amplifying the other 91.1 
(whatever it is)  watch its some renegade one around here.  Ohh well, 
i guess I'll just have to download the archive, although it's only 
56k bitrate, blah :-/

NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

been trying to get this one song for the past 3 days and I keep 
getting bumped down in the queue.  Now I'm not connected and can't 
connect to it.  Damn, I thought soulseek was 'underground' enough, 
ohh well.  They should have let people run their own servers instead 
of the one central location *sigh*

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Soulseek...

It might be stupid of me to mention an alternative to soulseek in this 
public forum, but hotline is a truly distributed sharing tool. There is no 
central server for it.

Servers communicate with a headend utility that can be searched at 
http://www.tracker-tracker.com/

There are just toooo many groups over a distributed network for this to get 
shut down. Even if the search tool gets shut down, all that's necessary for 
another server is desire and a unique ip address.

There are a lot of bullshit dickheads trying to make a buck and not adhering 
to the mindset of the tool as designed, but once you find a good resource 
you'll be happy. I find a lot of people setting up shop at universities and 
can get a consistant 800k/s or better.

The above url will give you access to the server software and the client if 
you're on a mac. Win client is supposed to be at http://www.bigredh.com but 
I remember some rumors they were getting shut down. You can find the 
"hotline client" on the net though. If you can't, pretend you never read 
about this because you're too stupid.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Soulseek...

just a heads up.  our admin got a nice police cease and desist letter 
for a specific incident.

it was from http://www.mediaforce.com/ and was fairly detailed.  a 
specific file, IP, username and sharing system was listed.

look into peer guardian located at amanda's website:   
http://methlabs.org/    =)
i'm not sure how effective it is, but its something.  it blocks the IP 
addresses of known companies like mediaforce, riaa, mpaa and whatnot 
from even having an IP connection to your machine.

nice find..
also WinMX by itself isn't all that helpful but paired with NapMX (populates
opennap server list in WinMX) could be a usefull tool. Has helped me alot in
cases where I was unable to find a track anywhere else... but not all that
reliable.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: [nyc-raves] cd settlement.....

I think there are certain cases where the extension of copyright is a legitimate necessity.

For this case, Disney continues to market new products (movies, music, clothing, toys) using the
character Mickey Mouse. There is no conceivable way you can convince me that this copyright should
be forcibly entered into the public domain. The losses would be catastrophic for a company like
Disney, who is still actively in business in the entertainment industry and is still actively using
the image of Mickey Mouse as a part of that business, and continues to develop new products
incorpoating that entity.

However, in the case of an unused copyright, i.e. one in which no new product or development has
occurred in a reasonable period (let's say 10 years), then yes, that copyright should legitimately
expire and the copyright should be migrated into the public domain.

For instance, if a piece of music written by Miles Davis remains out of print for 10 years up to the
expiration of the copyright, then it should become public domain once the copyright expires.

Or, an even better example (in light of the Disney example)...if Energizer doesn't actively use or
market the "Energizer Bunny"...if they've effectively given up on that creation, for a period of 10
years prior to the expiration of the copyright, then it becomes public domain.

Indiscrimanently extenting the copyright across all media is NOT an acceptable answer, but neither
is forcing companies who continue to use entities created under the copyright protection to give up
those rights.

If we can make a determination in the different levels of murder in this country, then we CERTAINLY
can recognize the different levels in retention of copyrights...

What it boils down to is that there should be some sort of statute of limitations on the release of
new product in regards to the renewal of copyright. That seems to be the only reasonable solution.

yes they have raped people for long enough, and when it is coming back to them they are upset???

it is extremely messed up that they are seriously abusing the use of copyrights (ie, disney/mickey
mouse, etc etc) and the law so that they can rape us some more....

i mean are you telling me that someone can copyright something and have their family do the same
thing for the next 500 years?
that is ridiculous, and insane..

i value artists determination these dayz to make something creative, (even if the works are not so
good, like we see more of now...), bc we as a species are creative in nature and it is what makes us
happy....
the value of that product is up to the individual, and if people willfully pay it, then so be it.

but me, i stick to my independent producer colleagues most of all, bc they produce the best music,
the best selection, the best open design of tracks and sell them cheaper than the industry.

oh, the joy of computers, and if they come out full force with palladium and comp architecture that
limits what we can do with our electronic devices anymore than they already have, then you can kiss
my upgrades goodbye...lol

I personally think that a person should be paid what they are worth.  I
put a high value on a persons work and the job that they do.  I don't
care if they pick up garbage, I still value that persons work.

The problem that I have with the Record industry is that they are raping
the general public.  On top of that they have manipulated the law so
that there "Product's" copyright will basically last forever.  This is
wrong.  It should become public domain after 10-years. PHUCK the RIAA!!!

Revenge can be sweet sometimes.  Case in point, the internet and it's
inpact on the CrackHead executives of the record industry.  Napster,
Limewire, Macabe, etc....has given the ability to rip songz of CD's and
then distribute the contents to anywhere in the world, record sales have
fallen.  This has gotten the attention of the crackheads.  Try as they
may, the will never ever be able to get the cat back into the bag.

Thatz my story and I'm stick'n to it.

OUT!

Stop Palladium and TCPA Now!


Okay, you folks understand this issue -- AMI and Transmeta
recently announced their intention to build TCPA technology
into their chips.  It's time to tell them that building
chips that let others control your computer, is
unacceptable.


1) Please send your comments using the form provided below.=20
Tell them not to produce their AMIBIOS8 and TM5800 chips,
and that you will boycott any technology that enables TCPA
and Palladium technology on your computer.  Read the alert
below for details.

3) Take up a role helping with this and other efforts
related to information freedom in the future.  Two roles you
can take up are to become a Press Outreach Campaigner or a
Commentator.  Simply reply to this email to show your
interest.

2) Please forward this alert to any other interested parties
that you know of, who would understand and see the
importance of this issue.


New Yorkers for Fair Use Action Alert:
--------------------------------------
Stop Palladium and TCPA now!=20

Tell American Megatrends and Transmeta not to make chips
that let others control your computer!=20

Please use the following form to tell American Megatrends
and Transmeta not to produce their AMIBIOS8 and TM5800
chips, and that you will boycott any technology that enables
TCPA and Palladium technology on your computer:=20

http://www.nyfairuse.org/cgi-bin/nyfu/palladium=20

What's Going On:=20

Last week, Intel, Microsoft, the RIAA and the MPAA announced
their intention to force Palladium and TCPA into every
personal computer on the planet. Palladium and TCPA are a
different kind of DRM, worse than even the most invasive of
previously proposed "content control" systems.=20

Palladium and TCPA would hardwire your home computer so that
these four entities and their partners would be able to run
processes on your computer, entirely outside your control,
indeed, without your knowledge.=20

Below we answer some questions about DRM, Palladium, TCPA,
and the boycott.=20

New Yorkers for Fair Use=20

What is DRM?=20

DRM is the political, legal, contractual, economic,
hardware, and software infrastructure designed and intended
by a loose alliance of cartels and monopolies to take away
your right to own and privately use a computer. No full DRM
exists in the world today, though pieces of DRM have been
successfully enacted into law and tiny bits of DRM hardware
and software have been placed in some home movie playing and
recording devices. Every single piece of DRM is meant to
help attain the objective of the anti-ownership alliance: to
get control of every personal computer in the world.=20

Intel and Microsoft and RIAA and MPAA, by their own
admission, have, to date, spent billions of dollars to force
universal DRM on the entire world. Last week these four
reiterated their intention to force DRM into every personal
computer on the planet:=20

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/15/business/15PIRA.html=20
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-980671.html=20

For more on DRM see:=20

http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/10/21/1449250.shtml?tid=3D19=20
http://www.panix.com/~jays/what.is.drm.3=20

What is Palladium?=20

"Palladium" is Microsoft's name for its proposed DRM system.
No implementation of Palladium exists today, indeed no
complete specification of Palladium exists today, but
certain hardware which a Palladiated operating system
requires is about to be placed in all personal computers,
unless we stop Microsoft and its hardware and vendor
partners, such as Intel, American Megatrends, Transmeta,
Dell, and CompUSA.=20

What will Palladium do?=20

Palladium will enable a few large corporations and
governments to run source secret, indeed, well-encrypted,
code on home users' machines in such a way that the home
user cannot see, modify, or control the running code. A
Palladiated system is under the complete control of
Microsoft at all times. Microsoft might allow some of its
partners to run code on your machine, but no code will run
on a Palladiated system without Microsoft's consent. The
mechanics are as follows: only code that has been signed
with a special Microsoft provided key will run. Microsoft
will retain at all times the power to revoke any other
entity's keys. In particular, no operating system will be
able to boot without a key from Microsoft. So if Palladium
is forced into every home computer, there will be no more
free software.=20

Microsoft will be able to spy on each and every keystroke,
and mouse movement, and send encrypted messages from your
machine to Microsoft headquarters. Microsoft will also be
able to examine every file on your system. Your encryption
programs will not work against Microsoft, or any other
entities which have full power keys from Microsoft.=20

But surely wily crackers and freedom-loving hackers around
the world will be able to defeat Palladium by breaking it?=20

No. Whether or not a few hackers are able to get around some
versions of Palladium, most people will not be able to.
There are two reasons most people will not be able to escape
the All Seeing Eye and Invisible Hand of Palladium. First,
Palladium is not like the absurdly weak systems called "DRM"
today. Palladium is both hardware and software, and the
software is locked to the hardware in a manner completely
different from today's weak DRM systems. The design of
Palladium allows for defense in depthopartners would be able to run, and =
even one layer of
Palladium is harder to crack than any DRM ever seen before.
Second, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the
United States of America, it is illegal to try to see what
Palladium is doing. It is also illegal to modify the
hardware of a Palladiated system. And it is a felony to sell
advice on how to disable Palladium or its supporting
hardware. It is hard enough today to get vendors to sell
computers with a free operating system already installed.
Once Microsoft and Intel have forced Palladiated hardware
into every personal computer, it will be impossible to run a
free OS. The very act of booting a free OS will be outlawed
by application of the DMCA to a Palladiated computer.=20

But there are no Palladium systems available today. So how
can you boycott Palladium?=20

We are boycotting the hardware that Palladium needs. Before
Palladium is rolled out, Palladium-enabling hardware must be
placed in most of the world's personal computers. Right now
such hardware is being placed in computers meant for home
and business use without the buyer being told. Our boycott
is aimed at stopping Palladium-enabling hardware from being
secretly forced into every personal computer in world. We
intend to stop Palladium before we cease to own the
computers in our own houses and offices.=20

The main Palladium-enabling hardware is called a "TPM" for
Trusted Platform Module. The TPM hardware will support, in
addition to Palladium, many different systems which take
control of the computer away from the user and give control
to large corporations and government entities. The TCPA, the
Trusted Computing Platform Alliance, is the standards
organization for the TPM. The founding Alliance members are
Compaq, HP, IBM, Intel and Microsoft. Since 1999, the year
TCPA was founded, about one hundred more companies have
joined the TCPA. The Alliance has published a formal
specification of the TPM. The TCPA's FAQ=20

http://www.trustedcomputing.org/docs/Website_TCPA%20FAQ_0703021.pdf=20

seeks to allay the natural suspicions of computer buyers
about what the TPM does. Unfortunately the FAQ is inaccurate
on the most important issues. For example, the claim is made
that a computer with a working TPM will remain under the
final, ultimate, and complete control of the user. But, as
explained above, this is simply untrue.=20

So what exactly are you doing?=20

We refuse to buy any computer with a TPM inside and we ask
you to refuse to buy any computer with a TPM inside. We use
the term "TPM" to include TPM-like devices, whether in a
separate chip, in the BIOS chip, or even in the cpu. This
means that we ask buyers of personal computers to find out
whether the computer has a TPM or a TPM-like device inside.
We will shortly provide buyers of home computers with
methods for telling whether or not a computer has a TPM
inside.=20

Is it possible to be more specific today?=20

Yes. We call for a boycott of the just announced American
Megatrends AMIBIOS8:=20

The better the sound quality gets on transferable music (several generation=

   I can't complain.  Artists get shafted on money by the music companies =
anyway, so why not, as an artist, just record the music yourselves and pay =
someone else to distribute/promote it?  That way a CD can cost what it =
should..  $5-8. =20
   I was talking to someone that's a Senior VicePresident at said Music =
company and the concept of electronic dance music came up and why it was =
so difficult to sell (also why it can't be sold out, no matter how hard =

quickly that the only place to hear the freshest, newest beats is in the =
club or at a party.  We rely on DJ's to bring us a blend of amazing new =
beats we've never heard, blended with timeless classics.  But record =
labels could never possibly keep up because after all the legal haggling, =
money allocation and production time it takes to put out a CD, the songs =
on the disc would be played out.
  The question put to me was:  If a music company could put together a =
program of the newest electronic dance music (by genre) and have it mixed =
by a known DJ, would people subscribe to it?  The format would be internet =
based.. like you pay some amount of cash and every week you get a new mix =
by a new dj you'd recognize. =20
   I thought it was a good idea, as far as popular attention trying to =

I think there are certain cases where the extension of copyright is a =
legitimate necessity.

For this case, Disney continues to market new products (movies, music, =
clothing, toys) using the
character Mickey Mouse. There is no conceivable way you can convince me =
that this copyright should
be forcibly entered into the public domain. The losses would be catastrophi=
c for a company like
Disney, who is still actively in business in the entertainment industry =
and is still actively using
the image of Mickey Mouse as a part of that business, and continues to =
develop new products
incorpoating that entity.

However, in the case of an unused copyright, i.e. one in which no new =
product or development has
occurred in a reasonable period (let's say 10 years), then yes, that =
copyright should legitimately
expire and the copyright should be migrated into the public domain.

For instance, if a piece of music written by Miles Davis remains out of =
print for 10 years up to the
expiration of the copyright, then it should become public domain once the =
copyright expires.

Or, an even better example (in light of the Disney example)...if Energizer =
doesn't actively use or
market the "Energizer Bunny"...if they've effectively given up on that =
creation, for a period of 10
years prior to the expiration of the copyright, then it becomes public =
domain.

Indiscrimanently extenting the copyright across all media is NOT an =
acceptable answer, but neither
is forcing companies who continue to use entities created under the =
copyright protection to give up
those rights.

If we can make a determination in the different levels of murder in this =
country, then we CERTAINLY
can recognize the different levels in retention of copyrights...

What it boils down to is that there should be some sort of statute of =
limitations on the release of
new product in regards to the renewal of copyright. That seems to be the =
only reasonable solution.

I personally think that a person should be paid what they are worth.  I
put a high value on a persons work and the job that they do.  I don't
care if they pick up garbage, I still value that persons work.

The problem that I have with the Record industry is that they are raping
the general public.  On top of that they have manipulated the law so
that there "Product's" copyright will basically last forever.  This is
wrong.  It should become public domain after 10-years. PHUCK the RIAA!!!

Revenge can be sweet sometimes.  Case in point, the internet and it's
inpact on the CrackHead executives of the record industry.  Napster,
Limewire, Macabe, etc....has given the ability to rip songz of CD's and
then distribute the contents to anywhere in the world, record sales have
fallen.  This has gotten the attention of the crackheads.  Try as they
may, the will never ever be able to get the cat back into the bag.

Thatz my story and I'm stick'n to it.

youre so wrong right here. in saying this, youre giving any
corporation rights to keep making money of its creation longer
than any idividual can possibly do it due to the fact that human
life is only so long. disney has marketed mickey mouse as an
american icon. yet you cant use his face without paying money to
disney? that actually does seem to do a pretty good job of
describing alot about america, but in a bad way.

fuck disney's losses. theyre a bunch of shitheads. they use slave
labour in many countries to produce their beloved mickey mouse.

so youll take from the black guy and give to the white
corporation? argh. mark, youre killing my cajones. you dont think
that miles' family could continue to make money from that
copyright down the line? must EVERYONE be a constantly money
grubbing whore to keep a copyright?

i was pretty pissed....i accused them of privacy violations.
i guess someone found that i was sharing it on kazaa and ratted on me by
using my IP. they were part of fasttrack or something.  i'm still using
it.... i just dont share anything.
downloading music for personal use is like taping music off of the radio and
listening to it in the car...like taping a movie on tv and watching it...
like using a friends old text book from school, and even using the software
they no longer need.  i dont understand this bullshit.  why make DVD-R's and

this world will never make sence to me.  i really liked soul seek too...

p2p will never die.
i got called from my isp this weekend threatining to dissconnect my service
if i dont get rid of kazaa & a tony hawk 3 ROM (where i even have the real
game IRL).
i was pretty pissed....i accused them of privacy violations.
i guess someone found that i was sharing it on kazaa and ratted on me by
using my IP. they were part of fasttrack or something.  i'm still using
it.... i just dont share anything.
downloading music for personal use is like taping music off of the radio and
listening to it in the car...like taping a movie on tv and watching it...
like using a friends old text book from school, and even using the software
they no longer need.  i dont understand this bullshit.  why make DVD-R's and
CD-R's?? why give us MP3 players?
this world will never make sence to me.  i really liked soul seek too...
fuck.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: [nyc-raves] cd settlement.....

I feel like I should begin this email with "Jane, you ignorant slut...." like the old
Point/Counterpoint skit on SNL....

Tom, you ignorant slut...

<<youre so wrong right here. in saying this, youre giving any corporation rights to keep making
money of its creation longer than any idividual can possibly do it due to the fact that human life
is only so long.>>

It's got nothing to do with the longevity of a human life.

A picture, an image, a drawing, a digital recording...the longevity of existence of these things are
not affected in any way by HUMAN LIFE.

What I'm saying is:

If a company (like Disney) continues to viably use the copyrighted image (like Mickey Mouse) to
generate NEW products, then why should they be forced to relinquish intellectual property rights on
that entity??

<<disney has marketed mickey mouse as an american icon. yet you cant use his face without paying
money to disney? that actually does seem to do a pretty good job of describing alot about america,
but in a bad way. >>

OK, Tom, let's do a little role playing here....

Your great-grandfather  invented a "widget".
His company becomes a wildly successful, international corporation through marketing and selling the
"widget" creation.

He dies.

75 years later, you're the CEO of Cox's Widget's Inc., which owns and sells:
11 Widgets-theme parks, Widget movies, Widget stores, Widget T-shirts, hats, pants, and anything you
can put on your body, on your computer, in your kitchen cupboard, on your car...pretty much anything
you can dream of to sell, you can put the Widget on it.

And you're faced with being told that your great-grandfather's copyright on Widgets is going to
expire, and ANYONE ANYWHERE can use the Widget without paying you a red cent.

You face catastrophic losses on the investments your company has made, you'll and the THOUSANDS you
employ could be out of business.

All over a piece of paper saying you own the Widget.

What happens then, Tom?


<<fuck disney's losses. theyre a bunch of shitheads.>>

My wife works for Disney, dickhead. They go out of business, I'm HOMELESS. Thanks for asking.

You're not thinking about the thousands of people whose lives depend on employment.


<<So youll take from the black guy and give to the white corporation?>>

Tom, please....

After over a year of defending your argument about black music, you're going to pull this shit on me
now???

This has less to do with Miles' estate as it has to do with SONY, who, in case you haven't noticed,
owns a great deal of his back catalogue....SONY chooses whether to release a recording or not. If
they don't think it will sell, they won't release it.

I was merely using him as an example. If you'd prefer, change his name to BING FUCKING CROSBY, the
point's the same.

<<you dont think that miles' family could continue to make money from that copyright down the line?
must EVERYONE be a constantly money grubbing whore to keep a copyright? >>

You contradicted yourself there.

It's ok for Miles (READ: SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT) to keep the copyright on his album that hasn't
been released on record, tape, or cd for over 10 years, but it's not OK for Disney to keep a
copyright on a character that they CONTINUALLY release NEW products based on?

What kind of fucked up logic is that??

Subject: {pb-cle} hotline, was: Re: {pb-cle} Soulseek...

There are a lot of jerks involved with hotline. As you use the app you start 
to get better at instinctively knowing whats crap. Mainly because the turds 
use almost the same language on hundreds of servers in the tracker. You also 
get some pay to play sites. Which I am against, but usually offers a 
conscientious admin to help keep transfer high and files good.

Mac servers and music servers are usually higher caliber. I think its cause 
the mac community is usually a little more into the art aspect rather than 
the business side. Plus every dingleberry in the world can figure out a PC.

:i: use a pc
:i: am a dingleberry

I've tried hotline a while ago.  The problem I was having is all the
people trying to make money by forcing you to go to their page and
click on banners and stuff.  I usually just figure out who the
banners are from and I report them :)  but it got so annoying I just
gave up on it.  Maybe I'll try again sometime...

but what youre implying is that its alright to allow music into
the public domain after the artist dies if there's not a
corporation continuing to market that product after the individual
dies. if you didnt know, walt disney is dead. but his company gets
to keep his idea private while a musician who most likely doesnt
have a corporation set up after he/she dies (some do, but very
few) doesnt? thats a shitty double standard. i would never give a
corporation more rights to an idea than an idividual.

too fucking bad for you. i wouldnt ever work for those

of living.

no, i was pointing out your contradiction in allowing corporations
to do one thing, while limiting an individual's family at the same
time. 

also, in case you never noticed, check out how many Disney movies
are made based on stories that are public domain. AND THOSE
CAPITALIST FUCKHEADS DIDNT PAY A PENNY TO THE BROTHERS GRIMM OR
ANY OTHER PERSON THAT THEYVE RIPPED OFF TO MAKE BILLIONS UPON
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHILE EXPLOITING THE POOR OF OTHER COUNTRIES.
fuck disney.

i'm sure that's what the marketing guys at memorex are saying.

"now dont buy these if you're gonna use em for pirated music."

it's kinda like the guys that sell ez-whips at stores, yeah, you really
think that many kids on a college campus bake cakes that need ez-whips?
fuck no, but they're selling a product that there is demand for.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Underworld event in Miami March 22...

This is the last day of the Winter Music conference.  I went last year, and
already have tickets this year for this event.  This was a really well-run
event.  8 stages at least running all day long.  Anything you wanted to hear
was there.  I'll never forget the amazing sound coming from the SPACE stage,
completely outdoors, yet I felt the base thru my entire body as I walked in,
yet the sound did not bleed from stage to stage.  The main stage is actually
an outdoor amphitheatre (Like Blossom).  Right on the bay where the cruise
ships come and go all day, Ocean right there.  check out www.coolworld.com
for the rest of the details.  They also do a nice job of showcasing the
local Miami and Florida talent.

The week of WMC is a great week for vacation (spring break at the beach as
well....).

Lucky for me, I was able to book flights and hotels the same day the WMC
dates were announced, so I got decent prices before the hotels and airlines
jacked their rates.

If anyone's going, hit me back...

Underworld leads a star-studded lineup for the fifth annual Ultra Music

also sport performances from some of the biggest names in electronic
music, including Paul Oakenfold, Sasha, John Digweed, DJ Tiesto, and
Paul Van Dyk. Other acts on the bill include Junkie XL, Goldie, Seb
Fontaine, Bad Boy Bill, and Sandra Collins. A number of this year's
performers are returning from the 2002 event, including Oakenfold, Roni
Size, Timo Maas, and Josh Wink.

Subject: {pb-cle} RIAA, ISP's, Privacy, etc

ok...now im not really certain on all of this...but imma throw these ideas 
out to you guys anyways...with the passage of the USA Patriot Act and the 
Homeland Security Bill...there are like 100s of new laws pertaining to 
"cyber" terrorism...now if RIAA is actively trying to block users from using 
p2p services and trying to clear "priated" material from users hard drives 
arent they committing acts of cyber terrorism?  why hasnt anyone even said 
anything about this yet...if you are being "hacked"(i uses this in the 
loosest sense of the term)by RIAA's IT dept arent you being terrorized? so 
if this shit goes on someone should start a campaign for RIAA to end cyber 
terrorism...if i had the money and a clean record id stick my neck 
out...ISP's are basically doing the same thing...they are 
accomplices...everyone at RIAA and anyone from ISP's involved in this shit 
should be put in a dog kennel at guantanimo bay and held without access to a 
lawyer...they are the real terrorists

IF YOU DONT USE P2P THE TERRORISTS WIN

i agree: FUCK DISNEY.
(and every other overweight corporation)

also: "property," that is physical or intellectual,
only exists in as much as some power (say government)
has the ability and motivation to guarantee and
protect it. it is an intellectual construct, an idea,
and evaporates when not upheld by said power. besides,
like i said before, anything you "create" comes from
what you saw/heard/felt/tasted/smelled before from
someone else, it doesn't come from you. everything is
already pirated. people need to recognize.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RIAA, ISP's, Privacy, etc

the solution is going back to the constitution for rule of law...but the 
constitution has been continuously usurped to benifit big business...i said 
earlier it started at the turn of the 20th century...i was wrong it really 
started with the civil war...contrary to what the sanitized history of 
america they teach in school tells you...the civil war was NOT about 
slavery...it was about the states rights vs the rights of the federal 
goverment...only lincolns spin-miesters figured that slavery would be a more 
popular cause for war than taking away the rights of states...the civil war 
benifited big buisness in a huge way...the souths economy was 
destroyed...family plantations were bought out by the textile mills up north 
or just taken as spoils by crooked generals so they could sell them...they 
re-enslaved the south...and this time not just blacks...there were just as 
many white share-croppers too...if you go anywhere in rual america...a true 
family farm is about impossible to find...most are part of huge ag-co-ops

our system of goverment isnt flawed...our elected officials are the ones 
that fuck everything up

his laminate, told the rent-a-cop it was on his record bag(which I'm 
assuming was backstage) and then proceeded backstage and the guy apparently 
saw him as a threat and sprayed him...

the puke everywhere
--caused by the pepper spray, people got sick, ya just don't spray pepper 
spray in a crowd like that.

the dude going to the hospital
--a kid Overdosed at the party.  There are a couple of different stories, 
but basically, he bought some drugs which he thought was either k or molly 
and it turned out to be AMT.  He apparently snorted the whole bag of this 
and went into convulsions, there was blood coming out of his mouth, 
dancesafe took care of him until the ambulance arrived, he was lucky to 
live and from what I was told was on life support as of Sunday morning.

the guy getting beat up
--the kid who sold the AMT...he had apparently pulled some shit last 
weekend as well, where 5 kids went into seizures(although none were 
hospitalized that I am aware of) at another event.  The guy was even warned 
and spoken to about last weeks events, but still proceeded to sell kids a 
different substance than they thought they were buying.  Basically, the 
promoter hit him and he also suffered some injuries while resisting arrest.

Ok, so there's the long story of it all....

Subject: {pb-cle}  Therapy- 2/7/03 Columbus, OH- Guest List Action

Hey listers...
Just wanted to send another reminder to you all about the new event we're
doing here in Columbus.  Those of you who made it out to Penetrate last

different(and I do mean slightly... some of the tracks Seije played were
brilliant. A lot of that stuff sounds similar to what we are playing right
now.  It's ALL house in my opinion), but the community feeling will be the
same.  I wanted to offer up 5 guest list spots to those of you interested in
checking it out.  SOOOO...

If there were more cover photos like that I would watch more movies.

Maybe I should get my eyebrow pierced again. Looks like it'll get me a

I thought it was very clever the way he put the K backwards in Park. Larry 
Clark has amazing intuition.

Did you know that Ken Park spelled backwards is actually Krap Nek?



That doesn't really mean anything.

Subject: {pb-cle} rude staff at havana

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


i glossed over something about rude staff at havana. i get the pb-cle-journal. i totally hate that place because the staff are all bitches. i really got in a serious argument there with a bartender there cause she felt undertipped. they're all the unabashedly superficial people who take clubbing and fashion and blingbling way too seriously. the music on thursdays is their only saving grace.

eventually i started seeing that whole scene as a total joke. i'll eventually go out again to dance and drink but not to talk to anyone with a fake tan. there are better ways to have fun than to sit in stinky loud bars with bad sound systems. (usually.)

i saw him in 97 or 98 at that house of styles party. or was it phryl?

anyhow, it was at the irish center and he performed with what appeared 
to be a hard disk recorder on play.

and sang into his headphones in a mic jack.

might as well have been a dat i guess.

i have a picture of victor the crazy russian humping cajmere in 
indianapolis at "insane clown midget".  fuck.  what a crazy night.

I am glad they beat that kids ass. Especially after he has sold harmful 
substances before. I hope some lurker happens to be in the right place at 
the right time and puts a bat upside his skull.

Or gives him the broken plunger treatment like those New York cops did.

Shady fucks.

Ok, the stories to go along with those...
the pepper spray
--Basically one of the rent-a-cops sprayed pepper spray on one of the 
DJs(Nautigroove) when Nautigroove tried to go backstage.  He didn't have his 
laminate, told the rent-a-cop it was on his record bag(which I'm assuming 
was backstage) and then proceeded backstage and the guy apparently saw him 
as a threat and sprayed him...

the puke everywhere
--caused by the pepper spray, people got sick, ya just don't spray pepper 
spray in a crowd like that.

the dude going to the hospital
--a kid Overdosed at the party.  There are a couple of different stories, 
but basically, he bought some drugs which he thought was either k or molly 
and it turned out to be AMT.  He apparently snorted the whole bag of this 
and went into convulsions, there was blood coming out of his mouth, 
dancesafe took care of him until the ambulance arrived, he was lucky to live 
and from what I was told was on life support as of Sunday morning.

the guy getting beat up
--the kid who sold the AMT...he had apparently pulled some shit last weekend 
as well, where 5 kids went into seizures(although none were hospitalized 
that I am aware of) at another event.  The guy was even warned and spoken to 
about last weeks events, but still proceeded to sell kids a different 
substance than they thought they were buying.  Basically, the promoter hit 
him and he also suffered some injuries while resisting arrest.

Ok, so there's the long story of it all....

and they give you a bucket of original KFC.

The Sharp VZ-2000 boom box had not only a cassette deck, but also a side 
loading turntable. Casio had a boombox with a portable synthesizer built 
into it. Thats so cool to me. If this interests you, follow the link.

Subject: {pb-cle} Review: Cols, Seiji


First off, if you live anywhere near Cleveland and you're not sure what
you're doing tonight, you now dont have to worry about it because absolutely
nothing up there tonight could rival what you would see at Seiji's Touch
appearance.

Last night:  Tom and Jwan show up ~9:45. Bullshit/drink till we Head to club
~10:40.  TJ is spinning with Don Carlos giving a little assistance.  Great
tracks being laid down.  Titonton spins his part, great breakbeat goodness,
absolutely no complaints on either guy's track selection, they definately
set a great vibe mood for the evening.

Seiji is, well... how should i put this?...very in touch with his crowd,
very in touch with his music, and definately very in touch with his mixing.
He laid down the hot shit for about 2 hours straight.  Towards the end of
his set he dropped this wicked ass minimal hip hop that sounded better than
any Neptunes beat I've ever heard.  I cant say enough about how much this
definately was in my top 3 all time performances I've seen, if not even the
best.  If you want to see something you definately wont get much of in this
area, go to see Seiji tonight at Touch, you will not be dissapointed, it is
the furthest from boring mixing that you will come across.

Crowd comments:  It was good to see a very strong showing there, i cant even
estimate the number of heads that were there.  It was also good seeing all
the old school heads i hadnt seen in 2-3 years.  Good music has a way to
bring people out of the woodwork.

Aw come on, you've seen a Keytar.  It's what would happen if a 
keyboard and a guitar had a kid.  A keyboard that has a neck like 
a guitar and a strap to wear it around your neck.  Very popular in 
the 80's.
Keytar.  
Classic!

Maybe people have more important things to worry about now rather than
supporting the rave scene. People are growing up, getting educated and 
looking to find a good job. Its not the 90's anymore man.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RIAA, ISP's, Privacy, etc

<<why hasnt anyone even said anything about this yet...>>

Um...good point, but I'm guessing because the RIAA is lobbying congress, so if they kind of suggest
that congress "looks the other way" on that issue, they'll get the RIAA's backing...

Plus, if no lobbyist group calls attention to it in a formal, organized effort (such as the RIAA is
a formal and organized entity), then it makes it that much easier for law enforcement to not enforce
that particular nuance of the law.

<<IF YOU DONT USE P2P THE TERRORISTS WIN>>

Thanks, Nick. You just wrote my new sig line!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: [nyc-raves] cd settlement.....

while i couldn't disagree more on your sentiments about disney, i will admit that i have my own
personal reasons for feeling that way...not the least of which are financial concerns. so, that's
cool. you and tom have your opinions, i have mine.

BUT...I do agree to an extent with your point about "property" being somewhat a creation of
authority, and the idea that "intellectual property" is somwwhat more of a myth than reality

However, keep in mind that one of the main ideas behind a capitalist society is that he who sells,
wins....if you come up with the idea, in the USA, you have the right to cash in on that idea and
live comfortably. I still don't see that as a bad thing.

While capitalism may be flawed, it's still the least flawed of the societal constructs, and history
proves that point.

m
--------------------------------

also: "property," that is physical or intellectual, only exists in as much as some power (say
government) has the ability and motivation to guarantee and protect it. it is an intellectual
construct, an idea, and evaporates when not upheld by said power. besides, like i said before,
anything you "create" comes from what you saw/heard/felt/tasted/smelled before from someone else, it
doesn't come from you. everything is already pirated. people need to recognize.

<<our system of goverment isnt flawed...our elected officials are the ones that fuck everything up>>

The problem there is, it's been going on for so long and the process is so inbred, that ONLY
MEGALOMANIACAL ASSHOLES RUN FOR OFFICE.

Think about how much balls it takes to say, boldface to the world,
"I know what's right for 20 million people in this country, and it's my job to help them achieve it,
even though 80% of them don't know what's best for themselves."

No way? I've owned keytars.

I've never heard them being called keystars before though.

You know... Donatello played the Keytar.

He is one hero-in-a-half-shell that knows his keytar shit.

Her name is Kristen... she will be contributing her vocal abilities during DJ Simba's set; she's quite good, I've work with her in the studio environment and am confident that she will make a very good impression in the live setting. Make it a point to check her out!

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Phunckateck - Sound Sphere Recirdings - Just Two Mgmt --- www.JustTwo.com

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran 
of the Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical
journey in the late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and 
jazz/fusion bands which helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. 
After a short stint in the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to 
the electronic dance scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. 
"Once I started getting into producing dance music, 
I finally felt I was on the right track to where I wanted to be musically. 
My reputation as a cutting edge producer, and later as a DJ, steadily 
grew,
and so did the work.

Labeled "The Godfather of Chicago Drum and Bass", 3D is the pioneer of 
American Jungle Producers. The first to ever have his dub-plates
rewound in a UK DJ's set and has out sold any other DJ or Producer in the 
USA.
A total of over 80 SELF PRODUCED tracks and remixes on countless labels 
has gained him world-wide recognition. 3D also holds a stateside record 
with 
13 rewinds in a 45 minute set! It's common knowledge that he'll cause 
major
damage on the dance-floor when given the opportunity!

The closest Paul has come to Ohio has been Chicago. It speaks volumes for 
our scene that he would come to play. If you look at his past gigs you 
will see that Columbus is by far the smallest city in North America that 
Paul has ever played. Thank you for helping me make this possible.

Now with that being said. This event is being promoted throughout the 
entire midwest. Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania & Ohio. I higly 
recommend getting your presale tickets NOW because there is the strong 
possibility of this event selling out. We are talking with both

GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well present
One Love
Northeast, OH - February 22, 2003

The production tandem of GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well trek north with 
some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, New York, Florida, California and many other states 
representing. This is an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio 
and see how much of a great scene we are and what we can produce if we 
cooperate. We have selected many dj's and have gotten full support from 
surrounding crews to bring you the following crowd rockers:

_Dj Rap_(Proper Talent)_L.A.
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live 
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londons Charissa Saverio, aka DJ 
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes 
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female, 
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of 
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent, 
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via 
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of 
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the 
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and 
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)_L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back 
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and 
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC 
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As 
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the 
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene." To this day, Feelgood remains 
one of the most beloved DJs in the country. From Coast to Coast and from 
week to week he can be seen spinning at landmark clubs such as Twilo, 
Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild popularity overseas. With 
Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak hour house sets only one 
question remains - Can You Feel It?

20KFreaks and GrooveFuel AM present
_the CUT N DROP tour
20KFreaks.com_20K_006 /_FACTORe /_jackal & hyde_remix

Set to release March 2003, CUT N DROP is sure to be the next dance floor 
smash. A-side, the original mix by FACTORe, the staple of the 20KFreaks

shelves and be the first to get your breakbeat happy hands on the highly 
anticipated 20KFreaks release of CUT N DROP and join us February 22 and

FIRST NORTHERN OHIO APPEARANCE!
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_( Hallucination Recordings / GrooveFuel AM )_Miami, 
FL

Icey and Baby Anne have brought his tracks to Ohio countless times but, 
the hour is finally near for Ohio to welcome the true prognosticator of 
Florida breakbeat and mayhem, Jackal. Best known for his involvement in 
the electro-core tandem of Jackal & Hyde, producer/performer Scott Weiser 
is nothing short of a living legend in electronic music. His most recent 
contribution to breakbeat and house heads across the world: Jackal 
Digital Mix Set - an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the 
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids because Jackal is coming to town.

Scott Weiser (Jackal) needs no introduction, both of his groups Jackal & 
Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables 
from Los Angeles to Berlin. -URB MAGAZINE

_FACTORe_( 20KFreaks / GrooveFuel AM )_Birmingham, AL

The staple of the 20kFreaks label, FACTORe is one of the most talented and 
respected breatbeat DJs and producers in the industry. Behind the decks 
since the early 80s, he's been ripping it since most of you were in 
diapers. When FACTORe throws down his pounding breakbeat, there won't be 
an ass that isn't shakin'. Come experience the past, present, and future 
of breakbeat as FACTORe brings his signature style and class on the CUT N 
DROP Tour. The tour was first named the "All The Tracks We Produced That 
You Thought Were Icey's" Tour, but, turned out that CUT N DROP was a lot 
shorter and fit on the record.

March 1st, 2003

secured an intimate 1 room venue, an awesome sound system, a killer lineup

another laser to blow you away.

Subject: {pb-cle} virus warning

Hey guys...
If any of you have received mail from my address recently with an attachment, don't open it.

Someone I emailed at some point was recently infected with Klez.
I'm receiving a ton of "undeliverable" bounceback messages infected with Klez that were originally
addressed to people I don't even know.

So, make sure your virus scans are up to date, and if you get a personal message from me w/ an
attachment, open at your own risk.

right on.

i'm not especially keen on Ikari...the night he, jwan and shawn did a triple live pa on Karem's Dub
Mission, his was the weakest of the three performances...but the other guys...

straight. rock. shit.

i'm not dissing Ikari, just not into his stuff as much as the other guys.

plus, i've never been to the rex, and i live right close, so it should be nice and easy to get to
it.

does anyone know if they have a liquor license??

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} i'm having trouble with this one

It has been this way for years and years. The stamps have been necessary and 
available for a long, long time; and not just in Kansas. No one seems to 
know about it because of a very significant loophole. You have to have the 
drugs first in order to get the tax stamp. You have to present the drugs for 
weighing and inspection to determine how much you will be charged. Once you 
have them without the stamp, you are in violation of the law and will be 
subject to fines, imprisonment and confiscation of your drugs. This was 
implemented in order to outlaw drugs, especially marijuana, even though 
those pesky Americans couldn't be convinced that it was harmful. You can 
find those stamps on every pack of smokes and bottle of liquor. I'll be 
damned if I ever have seen a marijuana tax stamp however.

Our government knows better than you.

Sieg Heil!

Subject: {pb-cle} List question

I am going to ask this to the list, just in case.

Recently my ISP modified their mail server to offer spam protection.  Some
of my listmail comes through with "Possible Spam" in the subject line.

The other thing that started happening at the same time is that email
headers are getting modified.

EX:  The recent email from Nick S with the subject line  "{pb-cle} HELP!!!!"
shows a return address of
pb-cle-raves-return-65396-doug=visn.net@hyperreal.org instead of Nick's
address.

My question is if anyone else is having similar problems, and to verify that
it is not a list problem that coincidently happend the same time my isp made
changes.  My ISP is having a difficult time tracking down the problem.

Thanks,

doug burkhart

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} List question

the header:

Return-Path: <pb-cle-raves-return-65376-trout=chemlab.org@hyperreal.org>

is put in there by the ezmlm mailer in use at hyperreal.

why?

bounce detection.  if someones mail is bouncing, ezmlm can tell what user, what list, and what message.
it can then keep track of recent bounces and if it gets a few then it sends a "probe" message (alien probe! like south park).  probe bounces, you get unsubbed.  saves me some serious grief that i had to deal with under the old majordomo system of 2000+ bounce messages if i didn't read my email ALL the time.
anyhow is that the header you were talking about?  it shouldn't change the From: or Reply-to: headers.....

exactly. the entire idea of art is based on people being
influenced by others. i guess this is spoiled by people who try to
make art by just ripping someone else off, as opposed to being
influenced by it. either way, there are almost no entirely
original thoughts that arent heavily influenced by things that
have already been thought before. im on an email list about free
use of sound/video/media in general, and they have some pretty
interesting thoughts on all of this. i generally tend to agree
with them almost all the time, that everything should be free to
all in the name of increasing art.

yeah, well you have to separate the reality of the corporation
from your own reality. my mother has worked for years for AT&T,
and she hears it from me about that pretty much all the time. just
because i wouldnt have had shit my entire life without her job
doesnt mean that i still dont say "fuck AT&T", because they
fucking deserve it. if you had any idea what theyve done in their
existance to beat up any "competition", youd laugh. without some
sort of government regulation, there wouldnt be ANY competition.
however, since there must  be, AT&T is forced to sell bandwidth of
the long distance lines that they own (which is almost all of them
in the country) to their "competitors". how is that competition?
fuck corporations. 

>BUT...I do agree to an extent with your point about "property"
being somewhat a creation of

that was actually colin's point, though i do agree with it entirely.

nor do it. however, even in your system, having something
copyrighted like that makes no sense. the most conservative
business people are all about keeping all government activity out
of business. copyright is a governmental idea. basically, if
anyone could use mickey mouse, it would force disney to really
have to work to keep their vision of mickey as the main one. if
bill gates could go and open up disneyworld seattle, they would
have to really compete like motherfuckers to not lose people to
his superior facilities. however, letting them continue to dictate
the copyrighted use of mickey allows them to do so while providing
only the least benefits to the consumers, who are the people that
would actually benefit from the competition of disney worlds, by
getting bigger and better parks for less and less money.

i dont know man. does it? i wouldnt say that at all.

I had no idea who John was until I caught him twice at Revolve/Velvet @ Zythos.

Both time, he was absolutely 100% fantastic. Didn't play even an average track either night.

This guy's got the goods.

i *think* they do..im not really up on that, as i dont
ever drink really..but i have seen them serve beer in
the past..so i guess that means yes? 

but i really dont know.
its a really nice sized venue though, aside from it
being a "theatre" so the seats get in the way..but you
can always dance in the aisle!


ive always liked the sets of ikari that ihave
heard..im all about the italodisco/electro fun.

yadda yadda

I just got done visiting with Professor John and Brother Mike.  Their geared 
up and ready to go for tonight.  John's gonna go take in a yoga session now

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} throb

When I was last at the Rex they didn't have a true liquor license. I'll bet 
money they're hard to come by in Southside too. There are just too many 
places looking to get one.

They did have a spot sectioned off by the bathrooms where you could drink, 
and you could drink upstairs in the balcony area. They had some baseline 
brew in a keg- probably Yuengling, and a couple bottles of well liquor. 
Whiskey, vodka, and maybe gin. Due to the licensing they couldn't charge for 
the alchohol, but you were strongly encouraged to tip. The Rex is a cool 
place. They've got Gone Fishin' pinball too. Thats the hot shit.

i *think* they do..im not really up on that, as i dont
ever drink really..but i have seen them serve beer in
the past..so i guess that means yes?

but i really dont know.
its a really nice sized venue though, aside from it
being a "theatre" so the seats get in the way..but you
can always dance in the aisle!


ive always liked the sets of ikari that ihave
heard..im all about the italodisco/electro fun.

Yes, the bar is still positioned by the bathrooms but you can take your 
drink anywhere with you around the venue, including the main dance 
floor/seating area where THROB is held. The venue itself is very nice... 
probably one of the cleanest, freshest venues I have been too in a while. 
The sound system is banging too. I will be spinning there on March 26. For 
those who are into the hard stuff, my set should cream your twinkie.

i agree with this totally. this is how the government
inhibits and erodes a fundamental aspect of the system
it claims to uphold by impeding competition, and
allowing businesses to unfairly subvert competition.
that's just stupid.

How about the fact that that's half of the deal? The government grants
you the right to have an exclusive ability to distribute copies of a
work with the expectation that that work will become public domain in a
few years. Why should only one side get the benefits?

Disney has already abused the whole concept of copyright to the point
that it no longer serves it's primary purpose: "To promote the progress
of science and useful arts". Not to enrich the creator.

How many of Disney's movies were completely original works? 101
Dalmations maybe? Every other movie was based on some work that was
available in the public domain. They have taken liberally from it, yet
returned nothing. Frozen dead Walt doesn't benefit at all from Mickey
anymore.

Copyright should be returned to its original term, 18 years. If you
can't make your money in that amount of time, too bad.

Why is it not an acceptable answer? Times up - lose your copyright.
Everyone benefits.

Hate to do it, but to quote Thomas Jefferson:

"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of
exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an
idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it
to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of
it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less,
because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea
from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who
lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That
ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the
moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition,
seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when
she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening
their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move,
and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive
appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of
property."

penalty

Texas Snubs World Court on Execution Stays
Thu Feb 6, 7:28 PM ETAdd Top Stories - Reuters to My Yahoo!

The International Court of Justice at The Hague (news - web sites) on
Wednesday ordered the U.S. to stay the executions of three Mexicans and
reserved the right to intervene in dozens of other cases.
Mexico brought the World Court case last month, arguing that 54 of its
citizens on death row should get retrials. It accused U.S. police of
violating an international treaty by failing to tell the men of their right
to consular assistance after being arrested.
The World Court said it acted in three cases where the men were at risk of
execution before the lengthy case is finished.
Two of those affected -- Cesar Robert Fierro Reyna and Roberto Moreno
Ramos -- are in Texas and the third, Osvaldo Torres Aguilera, is in
Oklahoma. None of the three has an execution date yet.
The State Department is reviewing the order and has not said whether
Washington will order Texas and Oklahoma to stay the executions. The U.S.
argued the order would interfere with its sovereign right to administer its
criminal justice system.
"According to our reading of the law and the treaty, there is no authority
for the federal government or this World Court to prohibit Texas from
exercising the laws passed by our legislature," said Gene Acuna, a spokesman
for Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The state is by far the nation's death penalty
leader.
ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS
Perry believes that state and federal courts provide adequate safeguards and
are the appropriate forums in which to hear "issues such as consular
notification on a case-by-case basis," Acuna said. Orders from those courts
are the only ones Texas will follow, he said.
Jennifer Miller, the chief of criminal appeals for the Oklahoma Attorney
General's Office, said the state was reviewing the World Court order.
Torres has several avenues of appeal open to him, including the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals (news - web sites) and the U.S. Supreme Court
(news - web sites), she said.
"He is not in the process at this time where we will be seeking an execution
date," Miller said. "He still has the opportunity to ask for a rehearing in
that case."
Texas will wait until all of the appeals in the Fierro and Ramos cases are
complete. But an inmate is often given a date and is even brought into the
death house while last-minute appeals work their way through the courts.
A U.S. refusal to heed the World Court could worsen already-tense relations
with Mexico on the issue.
Mexican President Vicente Fox (news - web sites) angrily canceled a planned
meeting with President Bush (news - web sites) in Texas last year after the
state ignored Mexican pleas for clemency for Javier Medina.
Texas, the only U.S. state to have once been an independent country, has
long resisted external interference in its affairs and has a history of
ignoring pleas for clemency.
On Tuesday, Texas executed John "Jackie" Elliott, a dual British-American
citizen whose cause was taken up by British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw,
members of parliament and high-ranking British clerics.
He was the 296th inmate executed in Texas since 1982, four years after
national death penalty ban was lifted by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The United States is the only Western democracy to carry out the death
penalty. (Additional reporting by Ben Fenwick in Oklahoma City)

im not saying that even allowing competition is the best, it is
just better than the loose monopolies that exist now. im still a
socialist, and i still think that the government should run all
these utilities not for profit.......

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} this really is a country of sheep

it's obvious that what we think really doesn't matter
anymore because the politicians feel that our opinions
don't matter, ala "they don't understand so we have to
ignore them and act autonomously according to our own
wisdom." or something to this effect. just think about
it... "career" politicians, i.e. someone who makes a
living ($$) off of politics, a person who supports
their own wallet rather than his/her constituency. ah
capitalism, yeah, money doesn't create any problems at
all does it??

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Cool Site

That's some real oldschool stuff.  I think I saw both of these boxes when I
was on vacation.  It was in Abe's of Maine, back when Abe's really was in
Old Orchard Beach, Maine.

The keyboard boombox was such a great idea I'm surprised it didn't catch on.

Subject: {pb-cle} Abbasso This Saturday (sort of BSP)

This Saturday at Abbasso from 9pm until ~5am:

Jayme O'Brian
Jason Sodditch
Jamie Tyler

Sat should be an interesting mix of house music (Jason
plays SanFran, Jayme plays deep house and I play prog
and tech), so stop by if you're in the mood to hear an
eclectic mix of house music.  As always Abbasso is
exemplefied by forward-thinking music, and a relaxed,
friendly vibe.  Hope to see any and all Sat. night as
well as ::True:: this evening.

-Jamie

Kevin gave me a burn of these cds sometime ago. and they're hot!
Strawberry has been the soundtrack for quite a few intimate 
encounters w/ my girlfriend.  
so these cds have jwan allen seal of approval, if that means 
anything to you;)

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Soulseek...

I have been working on something similar to this
Called sharewall it should be available for beta testing in about 1
week, and it will have net updates on ip bans and on the website people
can contribute to the list of bad ip address, not to mention you can use
it as a regular firewall. But the ease of blocking bad ip address so you
can easily share your music is all there.

http://www.iwantcode.com keep checking for release update.

just a heads up.  our admin got a nice police cease and desist letter 
for a specific incident.

it was from http://www.mediaforce.com/ and was fairly detailed.  a 
specific file, IP, username and sharing system was listed.

look into peer guardian located at amanda's website:   
http://methlabs.org/    =)
i'm not sure how effective it is, but its something.  it blocks the IP 
addresses of known companies like mediaforce, riaa, mpaa and whatnot 
from even having an IP connection to your machine.

you know what, i do not take part in the political
process because i don't even feel that i am a part of
this society. i am not a part of any society, i am an
individual. when i do try to voice an opinion to a
senator or a local rep and they tell me that the
nation will move ahead with this war even though the
support is lacking, it reveals the true state of the
american""democracy." democracy is a political ideal,
not a reality. if you still believe in this system
then keep voting etc, but i feel i have seen through
the veil. i have my own ideas and the ideas of this
government are nothing more than those iodeas which
justify their own self-perpetuating ends. politicians
serve themselves, i serve myself. i will swear
allegiance to noone, ever. 
i'm glad you voiced your opinion though, it's good
that there are intelligent people on here who have
opinions and don't hesitate to voice them. a good
debate can occasionally be fruitful.

Jason=B9s              interest in electronic music started very early in his
life, and culminated              in his entrance into the Pittsburgh
electronic music scene in the              middle of 1998. He quickly rose
to the top of the local scene, and              currently maintains a
residency at Pittsburgh=B9s top club night,              Groove
(www.412groove.com), which brings in major national and international
artists every week. Jason also operates MANGO @ the dejAVu lounge
and is a resident at this night. In addition to Groove, Jason is also

Your event can also benefit from having DJ Osmotic in the lineup.

A true              music lover, David Purcell began his DJing career
dreaming of making              people dance. It was in January of 1998 tha=
t
he first started spinning,              and his natural talent brought him
to play out for the first time              only three months later at the
private club night =B3Roman Around.=B2

Promoting              under the association of =B3Artificial Intelligence,=B2
he              and partner Smartie promoted =B3Fly Trap=B2 / =B3Mixlab=B2
at Rosebud every Friday night for two years. Throughout this time,
the night won awards for =B3Best Club Night=B2 and =B3Best              Club DJ=B2
from the InPgh magazine for both partners. Dave moved              on to a
new, more underground club night called =B3UNION=B2              and
resided/promoted this club night for a year and a few months.
Dave just recently started back at Rosebud in the strip district once
again. This time the night is called =B3Adrenaline=B2 and              it was a=
n
instant success. Mr. Purcell is working on Adrenaline alone.
Clevr also works with the Breakbeat Militia and says that some of
his most memorable experiences have been their =B3take-overs.=B2              H=
e
has played all over the region, winning over the crowds who have
heard him. One of his favorite experiences was at an event called
=B3Unity=B2 watching the sun set as the people gathered around              the
stage. Clevr states, =B3When the sun was down the light show
began behind me. I get chills thinking about it.=B2

Clevr=B9s style can be described as =B3funky, nu-skool, progressive,
trancey, and hard=B2 and is very versatile, ranging from breaks
to house. He spins because, =B3it gives [him] satisfaction when
[he] sees a floor bounce.=B2 When asked what being a DJ means              to
him, Clevr has said: =B3[it] is a prelude to creating music,
which is the pinacle of DJing, i.e., to spin my own music is what
will give me the most satisfaction, self-worth.=B2

You can catch a sampling of his selection on his self-titled CD, as
well as on his very talked about mixtape, Fracture, and also his latest
release, Sensation by Vibration. His passion for music is unmatched
by most. In the future, Clevr would like to produce, own his own label,
and maybe open a club. He hopes that others =B3enjoy the music
for what it does to your soul... Listen. Dance. Go home happy because
of a dope set you heard and come back to do it all over again.=B2

CJ              began his DJ career in 1998 at only 14 years old, after
going to a              rave and observing how music in that environment
could heavily shape              ones emotions. He spins mainly funky house
but dabbles in tech step              jungle for his own enjoyment. After
doing raves and other events,              CJ landed himself a residency at
the largest club night in Pittsburgh,              Groove. There he has had
the opportunity to play to hundreds of people              and with some of
the biggest headliners ever. Some of CJ's favorite              labels
include Defected, Subliminal, Naked, and Classic. His favorite
Producers/DJs include Derrick Carter, David Alvarado, Danny Tenaglia,
Dimitri From Paris, and Terry Mullan. CJ hopes that in the future
he can grow as a DJ and maybe even a producer. He also hopes to share
his love of music with as many people as possible. CJ is also a member
of the Twin Productions roster.

Affiliations: Inner              Child and Underground Vinyl

Scot              discovered a love for electronic music about five years
ago when he              started attending parties in Columbus and
Pittsburgh on a weekly basis.              Through the "scene" at the time,
he learned about the culture              of underground music and stuck
close to all who were as interested              as he was. Through the
years he learned different styles of music              and became
interested in mainly Jungle and pretty much anything else              with
a phat bassline. After learning to spin with his friends=B9
records, mainly Jungle & D'n'B at first and some Progressive House
when accessible, he tried his best to keep practicing, knowing that
he has found his calling, and what he truly loves.

After              several years, Scot became infatuated with Speed Garage
and started              collecting many records that are truly hard to fin=
d
from this scarce              style of UK House music. From this style he
found the hardest analog              basslines and sweetest vocals; the
kind of tracks that give you goosebumps              and make your hair
stand on end when you hear them played. He has              been preaching
and practicing this style for many years now and has              just begu=
n
to open your mind, are you prepared?

Scot has truly devoted his life to music. He enjoys finding rare records
for other people and operates an online record sale business. He hopes
to have his own record store one day to carry his enterprise to another
level. To this day, he is an avid collector and is on the brink of
possessing a prize collection of the phattest beats from the underground
era. Nowadays, he dabbles with many Nu-Skool styles such as 2-Step,
Breaks, Breakstep and some Progressive Breaks. He is emphatically
devoted to Speed Garage, and aside from spinning, he also experiments
with producing a Nu-Skool Speed Garage style. Bottom line, this guy
is addicted to BASS!

1) To              grow together; fuse.
2) To come together so as to form one whole; unite.
Anthony has been fusing together house beats for three years now.
He knows how to develop different moods by using a wide variety of
sounds in his music. Intrstrumental samples and deep bass are common
elements in Anthony=B9s style. A few producers who find the most
playing time on his tables would be: Inland Knights, A.D.N.Y, Kaskade,
and Hakan Lidbo. Certainly, he is a performer who can
separate himself from others. He views his music as an art form. Anthony
will never be satisfied with what he has done and will always be looking
to improve on this art form.

Lounge=20

DJ Centauri,              aka Tom Donatelli, began his career DJing a radio
mix show on WGTB              92.3 FM in Washington, DC in the fall of 1996=
.
He maintained a Wednesday              night timeslot for several years and
developed a loyal following.              The popularity of the show
parleyed into appearances at DC clubs such              as Pearl and Andalu=
.
By 1998, he was asked to headline a weekly event              at the Velvet
Lounge entitled, =B3Metrostyle,=B2 a position              he maintained until
he left the district in the spring of 2000.

Due to his eclectic tastes ranging from jazzy, sun-kissed house to
rich and sultry downtempo, Tom was asked to fulfill some interesting
bookings beyond the nightclub arena. These included boat parties on
Potomac, a cocktail party at the New Zealand Embassy, and opening
up for live acts such as: A Tribe Called Quest, Run DMC, G Love and
the Special Sauce, and 3 Generations Walking.

Tom moved back to his hometown of Pittsburgh in the summer of 2000
and continued his tradition of Djing at interesting events. Since
then, he has played at every noteworthy club venue in Pittsburgh,
including Metropol, Rosebud, DejaVu, Havanna, Zythos, Lava Lounge,
1814, Shadow Lounge, and Kaya. He currently holds residencies at 1814
and Pub IG. He has performed at the Andy Warhol museum and numerous
art openings and multimedia events, as well as a national fashion
show for American Eagle and several in-store fashion shows for the
Pittsburgh location of Liz Claiborne. In October of this year, Tom
finished work on a groovy deep-tech house track with VA based production
partner Chris Garvey, entitled, "Penalties and Interest."              They
are currently working on remixes of the track as well as additional
production. Tom was featured on the LA-based, =B3Interfearance=B2
mix show, and recently has joined the Inner Child House Collective,
a Pittsburgh based all house music roster.

I started appreciating electronic dance music in 1990,
listening to sounds coming out of the UK and Chicago. I see electronic
music as a logical progression in musical form, combining technological
advancements with advancements in human imagination. I began mixing
records in 1997 after several years of enjoying the scene from the
dance floor. Every moment behind the decks since I=B9ve spent
refining my technical skills and developing a keen knowledge of the
music. Although my interests continually change, I always keep a
progressive,              quality-oriented attitude toward each style I
choose to play.=20
I believe in the power of beauty, truth, and love and I believe that
music is the greatest way to express those ideals. At the very least
it gets people up on their feet to shake their collective fucking
ass off.=20

Tim has              played in Philadelphia, Erie, Cleveland, Colorado, and
North Carolina.              He has has a radio show fo more than two years
called, "Advance"              on WFSE 88.9 FM in Edinboro, PA. He is also =

February 28, 2003 :: Scarlet and Grey Cafe :: Columbus
Cooked Goose Productions presents:

Inclination Part Deux

Back in September we started a Friday night to celebrate the broken =
beat.  This Edition of Inclination is featuring the finer sides of House =
and Techno.

Jason "Lemon" Lyman-(Godown, Brique Rouge Traxx, PCP)
10 years of experience under his belt and a wicked selection of House =
music destined to make you dance.  Jason is returning for his second =
Inclination appearance

Mike Salamon - (DMBL) Columbus=20
Fresh back from a fall trip to Europe, Mike filled up his record bag =
with some great techno that you just don't find here in the states all =
that often.  He'll definately be dropping a pleasurable flavor of =
intelligent music stylings.

Goose - (Cooked Goose, DMBL) Columbus
I whore myself out to diversity, but I always carry really cheesy music =
in my bag if I'm feeling playful.  It's pretty much up in the air what =
style I'll choose to drop to open the night up, but it will probably be =
either breakbeat or house based stylings, but I've had an itch to drop a =
downtempo hip hop set of old school... who knows?

Scarlet and Grey Cafe
2203 N High Street (corner of Norwich and High)
$3 for 21+, $5 for 18-20 (bar adds 2 dollars for each underage head)

-Goose

** This is the same night that Titonton's crew throws their monthly =
breakbeat night at Standard Lounge.  I encourage you if you do not want =
to attend my event to please support his event, it is the hot stuff in =
columbus and well worth the drive from whereever you are.  I would not =
have thrown this event had it not been the only date available to me at =
the venue.  I would also like to suggest a compromise.  Titonton's event =
starts at 10/10:30, mine starts at 9.  If you come early to catch my =
set, and let me know that you are headed out to titonton's event, I'll =
buy your first drink (so in essence you came out for free) **

Subject: {pb-cle} ROMANOWSKI (Future Primitive, SF) @ NITTY GRITTY

OnPoint Entertainment & Headroom Digital Present:

NITTY GRITTY
the first Saturday of every month, it's all about the party!

www.nittygrittycleveland.com


SATURDAY MARCH 1st, 2003:

ROMANOWSKI
(Future Primitive Sound, The Curators, San Francisco)

www.futureprimitivesound.com
www.thecurators.com
www.romanowski45.com

Dj Romanowski is a riddle wrapped inside an enigma, dressed up in thrift-shop finery. While many DJ's play vintage music, Romanowski's whole life is an expression of vintage values. Though born in Switzerland, Roman's world springs from the Haight & Ashbury district of San Francisco. His image is very much a man living in the present, he just seems to have saved the best he could find from the past. You can hear it in the music he produces for Future Primitive Sound. It sounds like it's made of old samples but the way the brakes are organized, the incredible scratching, and the off wall composition is cutting edge. His music is designed for the funk and hip-hop fan, or better yet, for the person who digs dance music but may not like the fact that much of it sounds like shit. 


9PM to 2:30AM

well you could look at it like the sheep and farmer
aspect.  look at the political process like this we
are the sheep and the government is the southern
farmer that feeds us.  well the farmer feeds us what
they feel we need to grow then when the misses isn't
looking the farmer likes to stick it to us.  bahhhhhhhhhhhh

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is some seriously messed up shit!

OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT - Re: Soulseek Status 

This is to provide the official status of the Soulseek network as Friday, February 7th and onward. I have spoken to Nir and Rosalind Arbel on the matter over the course of this week and prior to this event taking place, and this notice is being offered on their behalf. 

The artist calling herself Sapphirecut previously made a complaint towards Soulseek regarding the sharing of her material on the network. When she had contacted Soulseek regarding the matter, she failed to state which material was in question. There was no information provided, aside from her being "Sapphirecut". Therefore, acting on such, a global message was made to users not to share the artist's material, and a notice was made upon entering chat rooms of the same. 

Unfortunately, this was not satisfactory, and the artist went on to file a complaint against Verio - Soulseek's server host, stating DMCA Copywrite Infringement. Verio, in return did not conduct a formal inquiry into the situation. Rather, they acted rather quickly, requiring the server, and site to be pulled. Thus, there was no warning that such was going to take place. This not only applied to the users of Soulseek, but to Nir himself. On sudden notice, he was required to seek out a new host for the server. 

To calm the air of panic, this does NOT mean that Soulseek is down forever. The RIAA did NOT have an injunction against Nir, as rumours have stated. Soulseek WILL be returning shortly, and this unfortunate delay was not expected. A new potential host has been found, however they are working through the paperwork for such, and have not completed such as quickly as we would have expected. At this level, it is out of Nir's hands as they have to simply go through the process of completing it. That said, we apologize again for the delay and hope that it does not last a great deal longer. 

It is important to note that Soulseek can not and will not condone any actions towards the artist that may cause her or her affiliated label's harm. Such actions would include defaming emails, defacing, or otherwise damaging her website or the site of her affiliates, and other further actions which may be damaging. Such actions will simply result in further problems for the network, as the artist will direct complaints towards Soulseek itself. Those wishing to show their support for Soulseek will best do so by simply NOT sharing any files by this artist. The files in question include: 

1.Free Your Mind, Megans epic mix. 

2.Free Your Mind, Sapphirecut's Original mix 

3.Action-Reaction by Sapphirecut (in any form) 

4.Any music that has Sapphirecut on it except the Illustrious track Id Say Yes, which is a remix. 

We thank you for your patience and support through this situation, and we look forward to seeing all users back on Soulseek shortly. Users who wish further information regarding the DMCA are directed to browse to http://www.chillingeffects.org. All information needed regarding the act can be read or studied there. Cheers. 

On behalf of Nir and Rosalind Arbel, 
Sean Nelson / Proteus93 
Soulseek Administration

Subject: {pb-cle} Unsubstantiated Van Dyk rumor...

I heard a nasty little rumor last night that the Van
Dyk show has been postponed until Feb. 18th?  The
rumor didn't come from what I'd consider to be a
reputable source, so I wouldn't attach too much weight
to it.  Anyone have any more detailed (or
substantiated) info?  

BTW, thanks to all who came out to Abbasso this
weekend...Nino Brown was great on Fri, and Sat. was a
blast...new faces, good dancing, and a great vibe. 
Hope to see you all again soon.  

Now it's back to the couch: 3.5 hours behind decks +
many beers + 3 hours dancing ass off = 1 beat-up club
kid.

-Jamie

Subject: {pb-cle} Substantiated Van Dyk Rumor

One of Paul Van Dyk's family members died yesterday, and due to this
he's pushed back a lot of his North American dates, I would assume in
order to fly to Germany and spend time with his family.  Due to this the
show that was schedule for the 16th has been pushed back to the 18th.

New flyers will be out on Tuesday, and ideally both the Music Factory
site and Paul Van Dyk's will be changed to reflect this in short order.

I'm trying to move over to Columbus, but I need to
find a place until I can get on my feet over there.
Any of you looking for a roommate or know someone
who's looking?  If so, get back with me.  Thanks!

Cool!  At least that excited someone.  Its pretty good too.  Hasnt completely sunk in yet to form a fully educated opinion but it is a nice mix of aspects the classic Autechre Hip-Hop beat dark melody era sound and the glitch madness like on their more recent releases.  The album will be out sometime in April on Warp of course.  The show will start right around 9 give or take so dont get discouraged if you cant get it in right away.  Save yourself some time though and go to www.Live365.com and register so you dont have to go through it all last minute.
Thanks and enjoy,
Jeremy

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} detroit

One of the promoters (Jabour - Off the Wall and Paul - Ill Productions) was 
supposed to get in contact with me on Friday to give me directions to the 
venue, but no one ever called.  I even kept trying to call the info line 
until 8:00pm on Saturday, and there wasn't any directions on there either.  
I tried calling Jabour's cell phone, but it got disconnected.

Subject: {pb-cle} toledo

there was an event in toledo this sat.
they shuttled people in a mini-van to some house
from a record store downtown.
cool event, odi spun a great set
but since the sound system was a little too loud
the cops showed up at 4AM.
I don't know what happened after, cause
I caught the first shuttle back to the
record store, but I don't think anyone
got arrested.
toledo seems to have a cool scene, with lots
of people from the surrounding area coming down
there is a party with dara headlining coming up

Maybe people have more important things to worry about now rather than
supporting the rave scene. People are growing up, getting educated and 
looking to find a good job. Its not the 90's anymore man.

that night was just strange.  I've lived here a while and expected some kind 
of dodgy set up due to the mums the word policy regarding the venue, but 
never did I expect to be driven to a house party in a mini van by a 
questionably sober youth *shrugs*  Still a good time tho, Odi ripped it.

Subject: {pb-cle} The more mixes the better

I am, unfortunately, doing my work within a cubical farm. Even though its 
high-end, its a cubical nevertheless.

My neighbor has a very bad stuttering problem that seems to get worse as he 
makes attempts to curtail it. Sometime he stammers over a sentence for 20-30 
seconds.

When he is called out on a misstatement, he acts as if the correct version 
is "what [he] meant to say" regardless of how far off the point he was.

He uses the same joke 5+ times a day and then laughs like its the funniest 
fucking thing ever uttered. He says "You're not doing too bad for your first 
day. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" no matter who he is talking to.

I am clarifying that because I want you all to know how much I truly 
appreciate it when you submit links to music. They are like "aural calgon" 
easing away my tension.

Ratana's Convex mix is currently helping to keep me from springing over the 
wall at this guy. Check it out if you haven't yet: http://ratana.chemlab.org

Trout,

Paul Van Dyk had to move the date from Sunday, 2/16 to Tuesday 2/18 
because of personal problems.

1.) can you update the post??
2.) What else can you do to help me get the word out, I would hate to 
have people drive all the way in to be dissapointed.

Let me know asap.

Maybe people have more important things to worry about now rather than
supporting the rave scene. People are growing up, getting educated and 
looking to find a good job. Its not the 90's anymore man.

To anyone that came out this Sunday, we're extremely sorry for the =
mishap of the night. We had to cancel the night due to the club owner =
making plans for an after-hours event for The Roots concert. The =
decision was basically made after we came to the conclusion that we =
didn't want to charge the regular coming people 15 dollars a head when =
they weren't aware of the situation going on. The owner himself wants to =
take on Sundays at his own expense, and has given us the opportunity to =
recontinue Pressure on Mondays nights.

In addition to getting Monday nights rolling, the cover charge for the =
night will be at no cost! Also we'll be running food and drink specials =
for you to enjoy. Dollar drafts, $2 dollar Long Islands, .20 cent wings, =
and also $1 pizza slices (drinks of course with a valid ID) ..... The =
night it's self will get interesting as the weeks progress, and we hope =
to see you there!!...

Sorry for any misunderstanding that took place... :)

Drug Tax Stamp
The fact that dealing marijuana and controlled substances is illegal does 
not exempt it from taxation. Therefore drug dealers are required by law to 
purchase drug tax stamps.

The drug tax is due as soon as the dealer takes possession of the marijuana 
or controlled substance. Payment of the drug tax will purchase the drug tax 
stamps. Attach the stamp to the marijuana and/or controlled substance 
immediately after receiving the substance. The stamps are valid for 3 
months. Drugs seized without stamps or having expired stamps may result in 
criminal or civil penalties which may include fines, seizure of property or 
liens against real estate.

A dealer is not required to give his/her name or address when purchasing 
stamps and the Department is prohibited from sharing any information 
relating to the purchase of drug tax stamps with law enforcement or anyone 
else.

Purchasing drug tax stamps does not make possession of drugs legal.

http://www.ksrevenue.org/perstaxtypesdrug.htm

Drug Tax Stamp
The fact that dealing marijuana and controlled substances is illegal
does 
not exempt it from taxation. Therefore drug dealers are required by law
to 
purchase drug tax stamps.

The drug tax is due as soon as the dealer takes possession of the
marijuana 
or controlled substance. Payment of the drug tax will purchase the drug
tax 
stamps. Attach the stamp to the marijuana and/or controlled substance 
immediately after receiving the substance. The stamps are valid for 3 
months. Drugs seized without stamps or having expired stamps may result
in 
criminal or civil penalties which may include fines, seizure of property
or 
liens against real estate.

A dealer is not required to give his/her name or address when purchasing

stamps and the Department is prohibited from sharing any information 
relating to the purchase of drug tax stamps with law enforcement or
anyone 
else.

Purchasing drug tax stamps does not make possession of drugs legal.

all this is an excuse to get people on tax charges as well as criminal

Wow, look at these rates!  The tax on ecstasy would be $40 per pill!

Drug Tax Stamp
The fact that dealing marijuana and controlled substances is illegal
does
not exempt it from taxation. Therefore drug dealers are required by law
to
purchase drug tax stamps.

The drug tax is due as soon as the dealer takes possession of the
marijuana
or controlled substance. Payment of the drug tax will purchase the drug
tax
stamps. Attach the stamp to the marijuana and/or controlled substance
immediately after receiving the substance. The stamps are valid for 3
months. Drugs seized without stamps or having expired stamps may result
in
criminal or civil penalties which may include fines, seizure of property
or
liens against real estate.

A dealer is not required to give his/her name or address when purchasing

stamps and the Department is prohibited from sharing any information
relating to the purchase of drug tax stamps with law enforcement or
anyone
else.

Purchasing drug tax stamps does not make possession of drugs legal.

I think that someone should go to kansas and buy these drug stamps... i bet
you could sell them shits on ebay for novelty value in the rest of the
country.

Ben, i realize it's older news, but it hit mainstream this week on a couple
'site of the day' sites... so you gotta cut em some slack.  if they start to
post links from yahoo news from 2 weeks ago, then we bust out the troy
mcclure wannabe.

I was just busting your stones cause we were talking about it right here on 
the PB-Cle last week. Thats why I thought the link was fitting.

I am all about decriminalization. Then you have tax dollars to pay for 
education and for rehab. You eliminate half the inmates in federal prisons, 
and you put a huge dent in things like violence and organized crime.

Ok, lets see. That takes money from law enforcement, penal system, la casa 
nostra, etc. Not gonna happen I guess.

was a great music, probobly the best house set I've heard in the last 
several months, right up there with mr scruff's set when he was at touch.

unfortunately I had to miss paul johnson because of the best catfight 
I've seen in the last couple of months, oh well

Maybe people have more important things to worry about now rather than
supporting the rave scene. People are growing up, getting educated and 
looking to find a good job. Its not the 90's anymore man.

CHARLES FEELGOOD BIO (from buzzlife) 
Charles Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. 
It was from his exposure with Fever that Feelgood's popularity quickly rose, as his weekly club was packed with up to 2,500 fans every Thursday for over six years. Feelgood's ability to drop kick-ass House music conveniently allows him to crossover between raves and clubs with ease and it is this talent that has enabled him to consistently rake in the praise and admiration from fans and fellow DJs alike. 
In addition to his busy touring schedule, Feelgood has expanded into production and remixing including six new tracks for his own label, Charm City Records. Another one of his singles, "I Want You To Fly", was recently released through F-111. His first release on Moonshine, "Can You Feel It?" showcases his unique style of blending funky, bumpin', party-time House that aptly resembles one of his famous club sets. 
Feelgood is now on board as the latest Moonshine artist to lend their impressive talents to the djmixed.com series. djmixed.com, the relatively new collaborative series by Moonshine Music and the website of the same name, has seen both Keoki and Micro provide their mixes to this burgeoning brand name. This time around, Feelgood will get his chance to bring the House down! 
To this day, Feelgood remains one of the most beloved DJs in the country. From Coast to Coast and from week to week he can be seen spinning at landmark clubs such as Twilo, Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild popularity overseas. With Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak hour House sets, one can't help but be a fan.

just wanted to let everyone know that mr. c (formerly

pittsburgh next wednesday the 19th for only $8!!!!!

ElectraSoul takes place every wednesday night @
memphis lounge above zythos, 2108 e. carson street,
south side of pittsburgh, and is brought to you by
house of styles. (zythos: 412.481.2234) 

this week mr. c will be joined by ted zelch and bill
powers of twin productions, with live visuals by
type-zero. sorry to the young'ins but this is a 21 +
event, so bring i.d. and get there early cuz it is a
small venue and it WILL be packed. 

to those who don't know mr. c is known to spin a wide
range of styles ranging from house to techno and
anything in between, plus plenty of unexpected twists!
i've seen him before, and he rocked (and i'm pretty
damn hard to please) so don't miss this golden
opportunity to see him up close and personal!!

thanks
cp/house of styles

Our trip was different. It was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character; a gross, physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country. But only for those with true grit...
and we are chock full of that, man!

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR:  What a day...

OK, I'll just warn you right now that if you don't really know me or 
anything, this message will more then likely sound really stupid, 
lame, whatever...

At the internship site today I was just mainly reinstalling a 
computer, but something just got me so drained and I was so tired.  
Well school (Bryant and Stratton, Parma) pretty much sucked as well.  
I am trying to figure out stuff and I just couldn't.  Then in my 
final class of the night, my database administration one, I got this 
one problem done and I was so excited.  I don't know if it was the 
combination of mini-thin and Mt. Dew or if I was just genuinly happy. 
 Anywho, I then helped this other chick figure it out, for like a 
half hour.  We had a bake sale today, well she was so happy she went 
and got me this candy rose that has two hershy kisses in it as the 
rose.  I was so touched I almost cried.  Usually I just do the 
sarchastic, fake "it's so beutiful" *sniff, sniff* but this time I 
did that to cover up the fact that I really almost did cry from it.  
It was just one of those days and that just made me feel so much 
better.  I think it was .35 or something, but it's the gesture that 
made me so happy.  Plus she commented that I smelled nice :D  And 
before you start thinking it, she's engaged.  She also goes to raves 
around here.  She mentioned that she was on this list at one point, 
but not anymore (this was a few months ago), but if she is on here, 
thank you.  I would mention her name, but she's a really shy person, 
she'll know that I'm talking about her (don't know of anyone on the 
list that goes to BS :)  or even anyone else at BS that likes raves 
and stuff)

And if you think a grown man saying he was on the verge of tears on a 
list of 500+ people (or whatever it is) to be someone that's a baby, 
then F@$# off ;)

:i:'m still tired though...

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

E-Sassin Los Angeles,CA
Phunckateck - Sound Sphere Recirdings - Just Two Mgmt --- www.JustTwo.com

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran 
of the Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical
journey in the late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and 
jazz/fusion bands which helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. 
After a short stint in the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to 
the electronic dance scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. 
"Once I started getting into producing dance music, 
I finally felt I was on the right track to where I wanted to be musically. 
My reputation as a cutting edge producer, and later as a DJ, steadily 
grew,
and so did the work.

DJ 3D Chicago,IL
UPTempo Dance Music - N20 - Just Two Mgmt ---- www.DJ3D.net

Labeled "The Godfather of Chicago Drum and Bass", 3D is the pioneer of 
American Jungle Producers. The first to ever have his dub-plates
rewound in a UK DJ's set and has out sold any other DJ or Producer in the 
USA.
A total of over 80 SELF PRODUCED tracks and remixes on countless labels 
has gained him world-wide recognition. 3D also holds a stateside record 
with 
13 rewinds in a 45 minute set! It's common knowledge that he'll cause 
major
damage on the dance-floor when given the opportunity!

The closest Paul has come to Ohio has been Chicago. It speaks volumes for 
our scene that he would come to play. If you look at his past gigs you 
will see that Columbus is by far the smallest city in North America that 
Paul has ever played. Thank you for helping me make this possible.

Now with that being said. This event is being promoted throughout the 
entire midwest. Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania & Ohio. I higly 
recommend getting your presale tickets NOW because there is the strong 
possibility of this event selling out. We are talking with both 
Ticketmaster and ticketweb and we will have them online with one of the 
services by the end of this week.
Presales start at only $25.

sound. As well as regularly appearing on London Acid Techno labels Stay Up
Forever, Cluster, and Smitten, his releases can also be found gracing a
greater variety of labels such as Molecular, Techno Slut, Eukatech, 12"
Monkeys and his own label Hydraulix. There have been many solo projects,
and many collaborations with long-term partners that include Chris
Liberator, Lawrie Immersion, Geezer, and Kris Needs.

GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well present
One Love
Northeast, OH - February 22, 2003

The production tandem of GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well trek north with 
some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, New York, Florida, California and many other states 
representing. This is an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio 
and see how much of a great scene we are and what we can produce if we 
cooperate. We have selected many dj's and have gotten full support from 
surrounding crews to bring you the following crowd rockers:

_Dj Rap_(Proper Talent)_L.A.
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live 
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londons Charissa Saverio, aka DJ 
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes 
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female, 
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of 
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent, 
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via 
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of 
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the 
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and 
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)_L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back 
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and 
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC 
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As 
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the 
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene." To this day, Feelgood remains 
one of the most beloved DJs in the country. From Coast to Coast and from 
week to week he can be seen spinning at landmark clubs such as Twilo, 
Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild popularity overseas. With 
Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak hour house sets only one 
question remains - Can You Feel It?

FIRST NORTHERN OHIO APPEARANCE!
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_( Hallucination Recordings / GrooveFuel AM )_Miami,

the hour is finally near for Ohio to welcome the true prognosticator of 
Florida breakbeat and mayhem, Jackal. Best known for his involvement in 
the electro-core tandem of Jackal & Hyde, producer/performer Scott Weiser 
is nothing short of a living legend in electronic music. His most recent 
contribution to breakbeat and house heads across the world: Jackal 
Digital Mix Set - an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the 
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids because Jackal is coming to town.

Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables 
from Los Angeles to Berlin. -URB MAGAZINE

diapers. When FACTORe throws down his pounding breakbeat, there won't be 
an ass that isn't shakin'. Come experience the past, present, and future 
of breakbeat as FACTORe brings his signature style and class on the CUT N 
DROP Tour. The tour was first named the "All The Tracks We Produced That 
You Thought Were Icey's" Tour, but, turned out that CUT N DROP was a lot 
shorter and fit on the record.

Fri Feb 28                  INCLINATION PART DEUX                  Columbus

February 28, 2003 :: Scarlet and Grey Cafe :: Columbus
Cooked Goose Productions presents:

Inclination Part Deux

Back in September we started a Friday night to celebrate the broken beat.  
This Edition of Inclination is featuring the finer sides of House and 
Techno.

Jason "Lemon" Lyman-(Godown, Brique Rouge Traxx, PCP)
10 years of experience under his belt and a wicked selection of House 
music destined to make you dance.  Jason is returning for his second 
Inclination appearance

Mike Salamon - (DMBL) Columbus 
Fresh back from a fall trip to Europe, Mike filled up his record bag with 
some great techno that you just don't find here in the states all that 
often.  He'll definately be dropping a pleasurable flavor of intelligent 
music stylings.

Goose - (Cooked Goose, DMBL) Columbus
I whore myself out to diversity, but I always carry really cheesy music in 
my bag if I'm feeling playful.  It's pretty much up in the air what style 
I'll choose to drop to open the night up, but it will probably be either 
breakbeat or house based stylings, but I've had an itch to drop a 
downtempo hip hop set of old school... who knows?

Scarlet and Grey Cafe
2203 N High Street (corner of Norwich and High)
$3 for 21+, $5 for 18-20 (bar adds 2 dollars for each underage head)

Groove Reactor Records and Buckwyld Entertainment Presents:

BACK TO THE BASICS 3
March 1st, 2003
Southwest, Ohio

It's been over 4.5 years now, and we're still going strong. We've thrown 
massives, club events, intimate events, and we keep coming back for more! 
On this night, we will revive the series that started it all - BACK TO THE 
BASICS! This event is exactly that - a return to the old school. We've 
secured an intimate 1 room venue, an awesome sound system, a killer lineup 
and the kind of old school atmosphere and decorations that got a lot of us 
into the scene long ago. We will be giving away hundreds of copies of 
D8A's newest CD, and we will be powering our evening's visuals with 
another laser to blow you away.

LINEUP:

pleasure to bring him to Southwest, Ohio. Check out some of his live sets

progressive blend of Breaks, House, 2Step and Trance. She is known for 
both her energetic and sassy presence behind the decks and her ability to 
throw down and almost any style of music flawlessly. There is never a dull 
moment when she performs and she likes to keep the crowd on their toes by 
layering different musical genres. This flexibility is also shown through 
her mixed CDs where she has released 2 House/2Step and 2 Trance 
compilations, her latest being Hearthouse II.

D8A: SPECIAL OLD SCHOOL ACID HOUSE SET - www.groovereactor.com, Buckwyld - 
Dayton, OH - Over time, D8A has developed a unique style that always 
pleases. Ranging from the hardest hitting house and on into harder German 
techno/ trance, you can always expect to see the crowd dancing during his 
sets. Tonight though, D8A is preparing a special treat NOT TO BE MISSED. 
He will be dropping an ultra-rare acid house set with some of those 
long-ago heard gems and recent underground acid tracks that will truly 
take you BACK TO THE BASICS. If you were around in the glory days of acid 
house and like the older styles of DJ Pierre or Terry Mullan, this will be 
the set you've been wanting to hear!

house sounds will surely keep everyone begging for more.

Columbus & Springfield, OH - There is no question that when these two take 
the stage the sparks will fly. Expect to be entertained with audio and

everything in between. Plenty of people have asked for another tag team 
between these two see get here early to hear them duke it out!

OOMPA LOOMPA: Trance - Cincinnati, OH - Oompa has made quite a name for 
himself this past year and the demand to see him spin increases every

SATURDAY MARCH 1st, 2003:

ROMANOWSKI
(Future Primitive Sound, The Curators, San Francisco)

www.futureprimitivesound.com
www.thecurators.com
www.romanowski45.com

Dj Romanowski is a riddle wrapped inside an enigma, dressed up in 
thrift-shop finery. While many DJ's play vintage music, Romanowski's whole 
life is an expression of vintage values. Though born in Switzerland, 
Roman's world springs from the Haight & Ashbury district of San Francisco. 
His image is very much a man living in the present, he just seems to have 
saved the best he could find from the past. You can hear it in the music 
he produces for Future Primitive Sound. It sounds like it's made of old 
samples but the way the brakes are organized, the incredible scratching, 
and the off wall composition is cutting edge. His music is designed for 
the funk and hip-hop fan, or better yet, for the person who digs dance 
music but may not like the fact that much of it sounds like shit.

Sat Mar 29                ANALOGUE HEAVEN MIDWEST V              NE Indiana

[not music, but gear related]

Analogue Heaven MidWest 2003

"The Voyager Home"
Official Information

The FIFTH annual AHMW get-together will be Saturday, March 29th at the 
PHHS Auditorium. I'll be there by 9:00 am. Who knows what time (or day) it 
will be when we're done :) All synthgeekgearheads are encouraged to join 
us and spend some time with awesome gear and great people.

AHMW 2003 is held in NE Indiana, midway between three empires of synth 
music: Detroit, Chicago, and... uh... Dayton!

MAP #1 shows the location relative to Interstate 69 and the Indiana Toll 
Road.
MAP #2 shows the close-up view of where to park for easy gear unloading.

Please bring a $5 - $10 "Free will" donation to help pay for auditorium 
rental

The exact address is 245 S 1150 E, Lagrange, IN 46795
If you need help getting here, just email me.
drew@ph.k12.in.us

What to bring:
* Your cool synths
* Long extension cords and power strips
* Audio cables, small mixer and headphones
* Camera!

With so many synths begging to be played, headphones are ideal for 
exploring all the different instruments people bring.
I have a PA for the performances. Anyone wishing to bring additional PA 
equipment will be welcomed to do so :)

Performances:
Live performances of all kinds are encouraged. There are plans underway to 
record them and burn AHMW2003 CD's.
We should probably try to sync up a jam session as well :)

Food:
We will collect orders and $ for lunch and dinner. Lunch will be 
sandwiches from the Lagrange Subway, and dinner will be Papa John's pizza. 
Feel free to bring your own if you wish. There are a couple nearby 
restaurants and gas stations, but not much. Angola and Lagrange have 
McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. PHHS is a rural school.

Also, since this is a school building, consumption of alcohol on the 
grounds is illegal, and smoking is not permitted inside.


A few of the local motels would be:

Ramada Inn (R on map #1) North of Angola at I69 exit 154
$89 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9471
has restaurant, bar, indoor pool and sauna

Best Western (W on map #1) At Highway 20 and I69 exit 148
$65 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9165

Super 8 (S on map #1) At Indiana Toll Road, Howe exit
$60 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-562-2828

Holiday Inn (H on map #1) At Indiana Toll Road, Howe exit
$79 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-562-3660

I can't tell you much about these, having never stayed at any of them. 
Several people stayed at the Best Western last year...

Subject: {pb-cle} Abbasso Afterhours Sat. 15 Feb - Deep/Prog House

this saturday at abbasso from ~2am until ~5am:

Adam Menses (mercury/abbasso, deep house),
Jamie Tyler (abbasso, prog. and tech house)

there's a private party until about 2am, but I hope to
see all of the late night crew out and about for
afterhours. Last weekend's was solid, and I'm looking
forward building on it, so come out and dance off all
the drinks , etc. that you took in everywhere else.
Adam and I haven't had the chance to spin together in
months, and we're looking forward to it...look for
some unexpected track selections and combinations of
our respective styles...not to mention I have some
bangin' tribal/prog records coming in tomorrow...I'm
stoked!

you know the deal...relaxed vibe, great people, great
music...so just show up!

Be forwarned:  If you show up before 2am I take no
responsibility for the music or the crowd!  There's a
private party, they're bringing their own DJ's, and I
have a feeling it may be heavily cheese-laden...show
up around 2 or 2:30 and all should be good, however.

21+
no dress code...come dressed to dance

Subject: {pb-cle} Singles' Awareness Day was Re: {pb-cle} happy lovers day

It's a holiday to veg out and watch TV, alone, with popcorn.

It's not so much for people who are in relationships as much as it reminds
people how single they are.  :o)

Fuck-a-hallmark-holiday-WHAT!

Top Ten Rejected Valentines Day Cards

10. I admire your strength, I admire your spunk But the thing I like best, 
is getting you drunk.

9. Our love will never become cold and hollow Unless, one day, you refuse to 
swallow.

8. I bought this Valentine's card at the store In hopes that, later, you'd 
be my whore.

7. This feels so good, it feels so right I just wish it wasn't $250 a night.

6. You're a woman of style, you're a woman of class Especially when I'm 
spanking, your big-round-fat ass.

5. Before I met you, my heart was so famished But now I'm fulfilled. . . SO 
MAKE ME A SAMICH!!!

4. Through all the things that came to pass Our love has grown. . . but so's 
your ass.

3. You're a honey. . . and you're a cutie I just wished you had J-Lo's 
"booty".

2. I don't wanna be sappy or silly or corny So, right to the point, let's do 
it, I'm horny!

1. If you think that hickey looks like a blister You should check out the 
one that I gave to your sister!

It's a holiday to veg out and watch TV, alone, with popcorn.

It's not so much for people who are in relationships as much as it reminds
people how single they are.  :o)

this saturday at abbasso from ~2am until ~5am:

Adam Menses (mercury/abbasso, deep house),
Jamie Tyler (abbasso, prog. and tech house)

there's a private party until about 2am, but I hope to
see all of the late night crew out and about for
afterhours. Last weekend's was solid, and I'm looking
forward building on it, so come out and dance off all
the drinks , etc. that you took in everywhere else.
Adam and I haven't had the chance to spin together in
months, and we're looking forward to it...look for
some unexpected track selections and combinations of
our respective styles...not to mention I have some
bangin' tribal/prog records coming in tomorrow...I'm
stoked!

you know the deal...relaxed vibe, great people, great
music...so just show up!

Be forwarned:  If you show up before 2am I take no
responsibility for the music or the crowd!  There's a
private party, they're bringing their own DJ's, and I
have a feeling it may be heavily cheese-laden...show
up around 2 or 2:30 and all should be good, however.

Thanks for the plug Brian...hopefully I'll see you
this evening if I get finished running errands early
enough...

a little more info on 'Local' - Abbasso's weekly open
table forum:  for those of you that spin in the
Cleveland area we welcome any genres of electronic
music as long as they're accompanied by a good
attitude - sign up for half-hour slots beginning at
9pm (get  there early - there are 11 slots each
thursday evening and they tend to fill up quickly).

-Jamie

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} check dis

well executed from about halfway in through the end.
but...the first two minutes are kinda cheesy. and maybe it's my headphones, but where the hell's the
bass?? amens aren't nearly as exciting without the sub-bass just shaking heads.

i applaud the effort...i'm not saying that i could've done much better, but this shit would
absolutely destroy some people in the hands of a professional.

the next one on the list gets it closer to right on. the vocals are pure smooth, and i hear some
virus action on that bassline, but it needs to be double tracked an octave lower to really just
rattle shit.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: war rumours

I was at work tonight and my manager told me that he just got off the phone with someone who said Bush made an announcement that we should stock up on food and water for 3 days .. true or false?

I can't find anything on the net about it.

Thanks!

There is a general alert to be prepared for a terrorist attack - the 
level is "HIGH" - 3 days food and water, duct tape for the windows, 
etc.

Or you could be like up single Pittsburgh people...we're dressing all in

is anytime someone says "Happy Valentine's Day" we're doing a shot.  Mmmm,

I should be staying in bed considering my Bronchitis and all, but all I

Subject: {pb-cle} Happy V-Day

Be :TRUE: on Valentine's Day



Tonight, Darbe returns after a week off -- and there's nothing more
dangerous than a well rested Darbe. Adam Oliveri makes his debut at ::TRUE::
after wowing us with some killer prog-house demos. Deviant bats cleanup with
a bit of the dark stuff with a pat of tranciness. Prepare ye for a journey
on some wild waves of wicked sound.

And let's not forget to welcome our visual artist, JDAT, who hails from
France. He's going to wow you with the visuals at Van Dyk at Columbus, too.
But this vibe is much more intimate.

Don't care to dance? Get comfy in one of the dozens of armchairs perched
over the dance floor and get lost in the sound. Love to dance? You'll
appreciate the wide, open hardwood floor. Don't forget about the back room!
Chill!

no way, fox news is where its at.  i love it because i know what joe 
millionaire is doing and they dig up dirt on him and the girls.  and 
i'll bet the butler is next!  
joe should pick the butler anyhow.

and they highlight such excellently newsworthy items as the lastest fox 
movies and actors.  ahhh, see what happens when congress and the FCC let 
companies own multiple media venues.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Bad Human Tour in Pitts

fresh is bc - he's responsilbe for 90% of the ouput, that's why he's billed as bc. people are more familiar with the bc name & symbol. same reason as kemal & rob data still being called konflict even they haven't put out anything under that name since messiah.  fresh is actually moving away from the bc moniker and moving more towards following his own musical amibtions these days.  hence the forthcoming ram and breakbeat punk releases as fresh. keep an ear out for temple of doom, the daleks & sausage dog - some off fresh's newer solo work, shit is off the hook.

nexrt, fierce isn't part of bc so why would he show up on this night? he's collaborated with them before but bc is made up of fresh, vegas, maldini, and d-dridge. fresh's djing has improved somewhat lately, still no andy c, but much better than a lot of so-called good dj's.

finally digital nation was put on the back burner for a while, they couldn't get the logistics of everything put together, and getting all the memebers on the same page was too dificult as well. it would be way to expensive for most promoters to have to fly in all six of them plus equipment and such for a tour.  i'm just praying an ep shows up with ailse 13 & submarines shows up, but it doesn't look to likely.  a liitle extra info - start the show (formerly a d.n. tune was reworked into start the fire (bc mix) & blind was originaly a d.n. tune aswell, but released under the bc moniker.)

easy

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} check dis

cream rmx - intro is way to long and leds no-where, amens sound way to cliche if your going to use amens now-a-days you need to make them sound unique(ex. huggybear)and not just rehash them. doesn;t matter how much you cut them up they still sound blah. the tune doesn't seemed to flow very well, the structure isn't fluid, no smooth transitions or changes, just repetive sounds. the atmospherics don't fit well with the samples, sounds like it might even be out of key, and were is anykind of melody or midrange sounds? everysample sounds like it was run through the same "wet" filter, and made evrything kind of muddy.

same with the other ones. #2 just sounds like an accapella layered over a bad aphrodite bassline. no cohesiveness, the vocals needs to be put inside the track not just layered. same wet filters over everything.

i gave up after 1 min into #3 - theese tunes bore the piss outta me.

hahahaha!!! :-)

sorry, guess i got carried away, sometimes my high standards get me a little carried away. ;-) but i would rather give an honest opinion rather than just tell someone there songs were good to feed their ego. if that were the case, nobody would ever find new areas to improve.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} downloading spree

If you're into a little rock, i'd strongly recommend Doves' 'the last broadcast'.
This has been on constant rotation for the last month for me. Excellent, and somewhat
electronic-related, since they used to be Sub-Sub. I swore I'd plug them any chance I got.

And these guys are worth supporting so if you like it, go buy it...I did.

As for hip hop, look for
Mr. Scruff
Dynamo Productions
Portishead's Essential Mix from 1995 (i got it from someone on this list...excellent stuff)

Maybe people have more important things to worry about now rather than
supporting the rave scene. People are growing up, getting educated and 
looking to find a good job. Its not the 90's anymore man.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} downloading spree

I've been into Flaming Lips quite a bit recently. I already liked the Robots 
album, but thought it was really cool when I found out that the songs were 
written for, and about, a Japanese "Band-Aid's" (read: not humpin' the guys) 
ongoing battle with Cancer.

That's a cool gesture for a fan. I wonder if there is any intention to use 
revenue from the album to help her battle. I'd like to hope so, but if not I 
definitely take back the cool gesture comment.

Subject: {pb-cle} About yoshimi....

>From allmusic.com

<<Paradoxically, the Lips use simpler arrangements to create more diverse sounds on Yoshimi,
spanning the lush, psychedelic reveries of "It's Summertime"; the instrumental "Approaching Pavonis
Mons by Balloon"; the dubby "Are You a Hypnotist?"; and the barely organized chaos of "Yoshimi
Battles the Pink Robots, Pt. 2," which defeats the evil metal ones with ferocious drums, buzzing
synths, and the razor sharp howl of the Boredoms' Yoshimi.>>

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} downloading spree

I am regurgitating something that I was told. I believe its true, especially 
when listening to the lyrics. There is a possibility that they didn't want 
to use the girl's name though.

youth and eye yamatsuka "covering" hardcore tracks by the old DC
band reagan youth at some live show. its basically just noise with
eye yamatsuka going buckwild. i love it.

on top of that i have a white label with a tune called more fire...different 
all together...

http://tarzan.spoox.org/display.php?type=release&id=13208

the bc mixes should be dropping real soon...they were supposed to drop this 
weekend, but fresh pushed it back to coincide with the video dropping 
supposedly...i think they just wanna hold it down a few more weeks and rinse 
the fuck out of it...marketing strategy and all of that

Subject: {pb-cle} Living Legends Tour // Columbus // 02.27.03

this is an all hip-hop event we're doing in a few weeks.  i know it's not
rave related, but there's not a whole lot going on in c-bus anyway.



Roots Records and On The Floor Productions Present...The Creative
Differences Tour



Living Legends Crew - LLC - Bay Area, CA - www.llcrew.com

(featuring 3 Melancholy Gypsies, G&E Music, Mystik Journeymen, and
individual performances by The Grouch, Eligh, Murs, Sunspot Jonz,
Luckyiam.PSC, Bicasso, Scarub, and Asop)



One of the Bay Area's most celebrated independent hip-hop collectives, LLC
has been blessing audiences through its many incarnations since the mid-90's
when the already notorious Mystik Journeymen teamed up with Log Cabin to
promote the love.  It worked.  With family members extending from Belgium to
Japan and back to The Bay, the Legends have earned a worldwide reputation
for their unmistakable sound while still keeping their underground roots
firmly planted.  Having toured the world and then some, the Living Legends
have gained a loyal cult following of backpackers, b-boys, and headnodders
alike.  Come share in the love as LLC proves that their props are well
deserved.



Eyedea & Abilities - Rhymesayers Entertainment - Minneapolis, MN -
www.rhymesayer.com



Having teamed up with Atmosphere to for m Rhymesayers Entertainment, Eyedea
& Abilities continue to represent the Twin Cities with Eyedea's intelligent
lyricism and precise word play, ably backed by the on-point turntablism by
partner-in-crime Abilities.  Relentless touring and a pure love of hip-hop
have spread the gospel, and tonight they intend to claim a venue of new
disciples.



OMD (2Mex and Xololanxinxo) - Visionairies - Los Angeles, CA



2Mex delivers a style of hip-hop best described as "consistently complex,
thought provoking, and political."  Combine his militant lyricism and the
intricate patterns of spoken word with Xinxo's no holds barred freestlye
onslaught and you have Of Mexican Decent.



Busdriver - Project Blowed - Los Angeles, CA



Busdriver's uncompromising blend of styles reflects the confidence he
maintains.  Straight off of the success of 2002's Temporary Forever
full-length backed by D-Styles of Invisibl Skratch Piklz fame, Busdriver is
ready to take crowds for a ride.



Bombay - Hip-Hop Turntablist - Scratchmatic - Columbus, OH



Derek Johnson - Trip-Hop & Hip-Hop - on the floor productions - Columbus, OH

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: bush....

my thoughts:

if something happens on our home turf, it happens.  I'm not gonna take any
precautions or get myself into a tizzy.  If it's bad enough to affect me,
then any precautions I could take pretty much become moot points as the
situation will have escalated to an uncontollable state.  I plan to live my
day to day life the same that I do every other day.

What isnt scary to me is the possibilty of them attacking our nation in
whatever form, what scares me is retaliatory actions 2,3,4,5, 10 years down
the road that will have been well thought out, precision terrorism attacks
such as what was performed on a small scale 9/11/01.  I have to believe that
something much larger could be orchestrated, just not at the present time,
because it would be too rushed and miscommunicated, thus giving us the
ability to thwart the effort.

amazing how the american massive had been so easily decieved
by the greatest deciever since hitler...let's see: we accuse
iraq of weapons of mass destruction and chemical and biological
weapons...UN inspectors have found none, yet everyone in america
knows there's tons of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons
here!...how hypocritical, accuse others of your own sins as an
excuse for war for an oil monopoly!...same as it ever was, 
blood for oil!

and who else was made to pay for the sins of these false accusors?!
...you were!...10 million lay off since 9/11...countless major
bankupcies...countless hate and racism crimes...entire races
intentionally oppressed and hated upon for no good reason aside
from the hate propaganda that had been spread by the media!...all
for what?!

well let's see...every business here and abroad has lost tremendously
...more abroad than here...with even the UK and Germany having even
worse numbers...but who has gained from all of this?!...bin laden?
...no, obviously not he has had his entire nation completely 
reshaped, thousands of afghans killed...who has gained?!...
apparently only the US war profiteers: the intelligence agencys
have had their budgets nearly doubled...and military funding 
has also increased...you would think with the recession, money
would be allocated toward the victims: the 10 million families who 
have lost their jobs, but instead bush cut taxes for the rich, of
which the poor recieved nearly no benefit for...all big business
across the board have lost ass...they had even spent more
funding biased hollywood propaganda style movies than to compensate 
all the victims!

and with the cuts in city and education, the local communities
will also suffer...and this generation, which has had some of 
the highest drop out rates ever (a bad trend toward disfunctionality)
has been so brainwashed into war and violence there had been
further outburts of terrorism like the baltimore sniper and the
OSU riots that turn out to be just a bunch of crazy americans!

if america doesn't stop bullshitting itself so that these evil
bastards can profit from war while everybody else loses ass
this nation truly will go to hell!

Terror Alert Partly Based on Fabricated Information 

By Brian Ross, Len Tepper and Jill Rackmill, ABC News.Com

National Guardsmen and police gather at Grand Central Station in New York
early today. (REUTERS/Peter Morgan) 

A key piece of the information leading to recent terror alerts was fabricated,
according to two senior law enforcement officials in Washington and New York.


The officials said that a claim made by a captured al Qaeda member that Washington,
New York or Florida would be hit by a "dirty bomb" sometime this week had
proven to be a product of his imagination. 

The informant described a detailed plan that an al Qaeda cell operating in
either Virginia or Detroit had developed a way to slip past airport scanners
with dirty bombs encased in shoes, suitcases, or laptops, sources told ABCNEWS.
The informant reportedly cited specific targets of government buildings and
Christian or clerical centers. 

"This piece of that puzzle turns out to be fabricated and therefore the reason
for a lot of the alarm, particularly in Washington this week, has been dissipated
after they found out that this information was not true," said Vince Cannistraro,
former CIA counter-terrorism chief and ABCNEWS consultant. 

It was only after the threat level was elevated to orange  meaning high
 last week, that the informant was subjected to a polygraph test by the
FBI, officials told ABCNEWS. 

"This person did not pass," said Cannistraro. 

According to officials, the FBI and the CIA are pointing fingers at each
other. An FBI spokesperson told ABCNEWS today he was "not familiar with the
scenario," but did not think it was accurate. 

Despite the fabricated report, there are no plans to change the threat level.
Officials said other intelligence has been validated and that the high level
of precautions is fully warranted. 

New Yorkers Taking Police Presence in Stride 

In New York, police are out in force in the subways, at train stations and
airports and at the bridge and tunnel crossings into the city with radiation
detectors and gas masks. In a press conference this afternoon, Mayor Michael
Bloomberg said 16,000 law enforcement officials trained to combat terrorism
were deployed in the city. Air patrols have also returned to New York. 

"We are constantly changing what we're doing so no one can predict what instruments
we'll be using and where we'll be going," Bloomberg said. The mayor stressed
that while people should be vigilant, they should also be aware that New
York City has been on code level orange for 17 months  since the Sept. 11,
2001 attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center. 

New Yorkers, and people around the country, should not be frozen by fear
and must carry on with their daily lives, the mayor said. New York Gov. George
Pataki said it is important for people to be alert to anything suspicious
around them, but that they should not spread rumors that could create panic.


Threat Is Still There 

"By no means do people believe the threat has evaporated," said Cannistraro.
"The threat is still there, the question really is the timing and when this
is going to happen." 

It's not the first time a captured al Qaeda operative has made up a huge
story and scared a lot of people. 

The FBI concluded the information that led to a nationwide hunt for five
men suspected of infiltrating the United States on Christmas Eve was fabricated
by an informant, and the agency called off the alert sparked by the information.


Officials said this one got so far because it coincided with other intelligence,
that officials still believe points to a coming attack, timed to hostilities
with Iraq.

Marines: Two accused of bomb plot were AWOL
Marine's mother: Daughter invented accusation
Tuesday, February 11, 2003 Posted: 1:08 AM EST (0608 GMT)

CAMP LEJEUNE, North Carolina (CNN) -- Two U.S. Marines arrested last weekend
on charges of plotting an explosion at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, had
been absent without leave for two weeks when police picked them up, a base
spokeswoman said Monday. 

Lance Cpls. Richard Morrison, 21, and Richard Thomas Medders, 22, were arrested
Saturday in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, along with Morrison's girlfriend,
Janna Rebecca Lynn Smith, 27. They were charged with criminal conspiracy
to cause or risk a catastrophe, and making terroristic threats and bomb threats,
Pennsylvania State Police said. 

Police said the three had downloaded information from the Internet on making
explosive devices and said they were going to use them at Camp Lejeune, where
the men were based. 

"They were both in the 'U.A.' status since January 24 of this year," said
Gunnery Sgt. Michelle Smith, a Camp Lejeune spokeswoman. "It means that they
were 'unexcused absents.' They were not supposed to be gone." 

Morrison and Medders served in the 2nd Force Service Support Group, which
provides combat support, said Staff Sgt. Jay Connolly, a Camp Lejeune spokesman.


Morrison's mother, Audrey Lincoln, said her son and his friend were on leave
and were due back at the base Wednesday. 

In an interview with CNN affiliate WBRE-TV, Lincoln blamed the arrests on
her daughter, Morrison's sister. She said the daughter was angry with the
family and had invented the accusations. 

"She called the cops ... and said that they were here making bombs, that
they were going to blow up the base," Lincoln said. "My daughter's nothing
but a liar." 

Police confiscated the hard drive of Lincoln's computer, she said, which
Morrison and Medders had been using. Lincoln said there is "nothing on it,"
but District Attorney George Skumanick said otherwise. 

"You have another witness that overheard these things also independent of
[the daughter], plus you have the items that were downloaded from the Internet."


Skumanick told CNN that no bombs or weapons have been found. 

The three arrested remain in the Wyoming County Correctional Facility in
northern Pennsylvania. Tunkhannock, the county seat, is about 25 miles northwest
of Scranton.

Subject: {pb-cle} what has happened...

concerned friends:

this is what has happened since i moved down to
columbus...i am an asian american that was born in 
ohio...i am a third generation american...my mother 
is related to one of the earliest emperors of china
...they currently live in california...my grand-
parents live in san francisco.

keep in mind originally asians crossed the land 
bridge to become eskimos and then migrated south to 
be native american indians...ironically it was the 
chinese who introduced fireworks to whites who 
turned it into gunpowder for mass murder and turning 
non-whites into their slaves.

since history is written by the victors, much of
US history make it sound as if the indians and
the other non-whites were evil when in reality
most of them were just defending their land and
fighting for their very lives

the only difference is nowadays the white
horse of conquering has also monopolized the 
information sources that often report biased
news making non-whites sound evil...however,
the hypocritical part is they often accuse
others of their sins: accussing iraq of chemical
and biological weapons when the UN have found
none and there are twenty times more here and
accusing korea of nukes for restarting their
nuclear enegy program after the US cut them off

anyone familiar with history knows that the
CIA trained Mao Tse Dong to overthrow the
chinese royal family to start up Communism
in China, basically to convert that nation
as a source of cheap labor for America, which
is why you see so many items including
designer lables and US military fatigue
with 'made in china' tags.

my grandparents on my mother side (the side
that is related to the first emperor of 
China) fled China into Taiwan at the time
of the overthrow...and my grandparents on
my father's side traveled abroad to San
Francisco.

my father was a prodigy, graduating early
from med school...at the time there was a
need for doctors in the Ohio area, so
my father like many other chinese doctors
that were imported, moved here with my 
mother around 1969...a year later i was 
born in Youngstown.

since english was not my first language they
were uncertain if i was intelligent enough
to start grade school...so i was given an
intelligence test, even at a young age it
was apparent i, like my father was of above
average intelligence, completing the test
with 3D drawings at the age of 5...and by
middle school i was getting straight A's...
i was accepted to Western Reserve Academy,
but only attended that school for 2 years
before i decided it was not for me...after
graduating from Rootstown High School, i
decided to attend Case Western Reserve 
University, which is like the ivy league
university for Ohio...Case was a difficult
school, but i managed my school activities 
as well as participating in varsity track,
being a brother of zeta beta tau fraternity,
a programmer on WRUW college radio, founder
and president of the CWRU Billiard Club, and
part time employee of MBNA America Bank 
before graduating in the Summer of '97 with 
a double degree of Pre-Architecture and Art
History...ironically, i was the black sheep
of all my asian peers: Ki graduated 
valedictorian from Kent Roosevelt and went
to Stanford for med school, Wan also valedic
from Kent and went to Brown, James valedic
from Kent went to Brown, Mitchel valedic
Kent Roosevelt to Harvard, Eric saledic
to Cornell, Dave to Cornell, and Chris to
Michigan...my little sister graduated from
CWRU and ended up working at Microsoft, she
is currently married with two children in 
Seattle, Washington...i have one more younger
sister working as a tech recruiter in Texas.

during college i was in a serious 
relationship with a girl for two years who
attended Ohio State University...since i
graduated from CWRU before she did, i 
decided to move down to Columbus to be closer
with her and change of scenery...i went
through a few temp jobs before i ended up
working at Noritech, who was involved in
making sure the computers were Y2K compliant
for the city of Columbus...in fact, i was
the one who gave the Oracle papers to mayor
Lashutka to inform him of the pre-Y2K
compliancy project...this was also when i
noticed the discrepency within the 
intelligence community on the leaking of
information...later on i learned that the 
US government had planned to keep Y2K 
compliancy a secret as long as possible to 
gain an edge on its foreign competition...
i think this was when they first mistook me
as a spy...this along with when the US spy plane 
was caught spying over China along with the Wen 
Ho Lee incident brought suspicion to many 
intelligent asian americans...the only flaw in 
logic is that i have never been to China, i have 
had no military training, and i studied art and
architecture in college - not rocket science
or poli-sci.

one more incident made things worse: i made the 
mistake of letting a drug dealer live with me 
briefly...except at the time i had no idea he 
was that involved in drug trafficking...things 
got worse when he got paranoid and thought i was 
going to rat him out...i never did, but after that 
he stopped paying rent...and when i finally got 
him out he has already made several false
accusations against me to cover up his sins.

as a result, i lost my job, and was put under
surveillance...the greatest irony is while i had 
been intentionally oppressed i posted over 70
world solutions on the internet, including 
several proposals for alternative energy and 
proposals for restructuring of the infrastructure 
to assess the neediest first as oppossed to
superfolous spending for weapons of mass
destruction and training people to kill.

unfortunately, since the current individuals
in power are pro-war and are bent on ousting
saddam, my solutions were viewed as 
un-patriotic, when in reality i had 
statistically proven that war is a tremendous
waste of money and has proven highly 
destructive for american business and even
global economy.

the intentional oppression has continued and
the situation was recently intensified when
they tried framing me as an opium dealer by 
spreading inane rumors about me...the greatest 
flaw in logic with this is if one had taken 
history, one would remember the whole reason
behind the opium war (when china lost hong 
kong and a few other major cities to the 
brits) was when the chinese emperor became 
infuriated with the opium dens after one of 
his sons overdosed at one of them and 
started hacking heads to get the brits to 
stop importing it into china!...the other 
flaw in logic is that i don't even smoke 
cigarettes and have had a great disdain for 
drugs ever since my ordeal with having to 
live with a dealer.

i am still being psychologically tortured
here by other false witnesses that spread 
extremely immature propaganda about me
because of the war on terrorism and automatically 
branding non-whites as possible terrorists or
a threat to white power.

it is such a pity considering just over a
year ago, all the races got along fine and
economically this nation was at an all time
high...but ever since Bush has been in the 
white house, everything has gone to hell:
9/11 happened, war broke out, racial
animosity, 10 million people laid off, 
major corporations going bankrupt, etc...
something is seriously wrong...and i am one
of those that have seen the worst of it.

most sincerely,
steve t

Subject: {pb-cle} the jezebel spirit, one of the final deicievers...

Chapter 7
Jezebel Would Stop What God Distributes 
Jezebel CONTROLLED her husband. She "usurped the authority" of her husband. It is that Jezebel spirit that has caused man to deny 1_Corinthians 11:3,7, and specifically 11:8,9. Jezebel has caused man to deny 1_Timothy 2:9-15 and specifically 2:12. That Jezebel spirit has caused man to refuse to acknowledge and accept 1_Corinthians 14:34-35 which is immediately followed by a statement that should cause ALL CHRISTIANS to fear the Lord if they DO deny it: "What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? If any MAN think himself to be a prophet, OR SPIRITUAL, let him acknowledge that the things which I write unto you are the COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD. But if any MAN be ignorant, let HIM be ignorant." (1_Corinthians 14:36-38.) Because Jezebel has so affected MEN, they do not know how to love their wives as profoundly "as Christ also loved the church". (Ephesians 5:25.) And because MEN are NOT so profoundly loving their wives, women do not submit unto their OWN husbands after the model of the church unto Christ. No, the church is not "equal" in authority with Christ. "Christ is the head of the church", and after that specific model, Paul repeatedly instructed, "the husband is the head of the wife". (Ephesians 5:22-23). To love wives as profoundly as "Christ loves the church" is the clear and repeated exhortation. 

But the Jezebel spirit has been allowed to cause man to forget that principle. As such, woman has taken control (even though the church certainly has no authority to take control of Christ). How has the devil, through the Jezebel spirit, caused that? It was by creating a doctrine that would accuse Jesus of sin (for even "thinking" about it, because of Matthew 5:28) when He spoke of, not one, but FIVE VIRGINS marrying Him in Matthew 25:1-13.) Hence, by the change of the doctrine of Adultery by the ((great apostate)) "church" in about A.D. 400 ((and all should know which "church" I mean)), woman was "empowered" to sexually control man. By the new ((great apostate "church's")) doctrine of "adultery" and "monogamy", man was forced to obey his one woman by her sexual blackmails. When such blackmails and control became unacceptable to some men, they would turn to other women. Because the new ((great apostate "church's)) doctrine forbid such men from marrying those other women, such "affairs" were nothing less than fornication. (That new ((great apostate church's)) doctrine had fulfilled, and again will it be fulfilled, what "the Spirit" prophesied in 1_Timothy 4:1-3a.) 

Indeed, MAN has allowed ("sufferest") "that woman Jezebel... to seduce ((God's)) servants to commit fornication". (Revelation 2:20.) And God's word is clear, "they which do such things ((as fornication)) shall not inherit the kingdom of God." (Galatians 5:21.) 

Likewise, this is not saying that men should go out searching for a number of wives. No indeed. If a man is not capable of loving one woman as Christ loved the church, he absolutely will not be capable of the exponentially-increased levels of love that would be required with more than one. Indeed, it is only a matter of profound levels of loving, because such would never work if it were only a matter of the flesh! Basically, when God raises up men as profoundly holy as Moses and David, if God calls such men to love, bless, and edify more than one wife (as Moses and David did), Christians need to know that they must not reject or persecute such men. But those who God would not so call need not to fear. It's only as God would call. And as Paul wrote in 1_Corinthians 7:17: "But as God hath distributed to every man, AS THE LORD HATH CALLED every one, SO LET HIM WALK. And so ordain I in all churches." 

from http://www.worldoutreachcenter.com/elijah_or_jezebel_.html...
 
Pastor Frankie Powell

I am writing this word as a parable to this great apostolic reformation. I know there will be scholars who disagree and others who even take offense, but let him that hath an ear hear what the Spirit is saying to the Church.

In Revelation 2:18-29, Jesus is addressing one of the seven churches.  While these may be ages of the church, many agree all seven are alive today as part of the Last Days church.  We all know they also were seven actual churches in the early period of Christianity.

Jezebel, while being two actual women in the church of the Old and New Testaments, is also a type of a spirit.  This spirit works through an authority structure to seduce Gods servants and also attack Gods true authority.

Satan himself rebelled against God. The serpent seduced Eve to rebel and bring division between Adam and his Father God.

In Old Testament days, Jezebel seduced Ahab the King to fight and take by force Naboth's vineyard. When Elijah, Gods prophet, began to speak, this spirit arose to intimidate Gods prophet.  Elijah became a father to Elisha, and in Malachi 4:6 we see the spirit of Elijah does just this. . . turn the hearts of fathers to children and children to fathers. 

In New Testament days, John the Baptist came in the spirit of Elijah! Again, Herodias working through seduction of the authority structure of Herod had John beheaded.  Herod listened to John, but this spirit hated John.  Jezebel means without cohabitation; not; what; how; wither; nothing; not exist; dwelling; false, God moves to restore fathers to sons and sons to fathers. 

God sent Jesus to do this in the earth, but the organized church of His day fought Him and falsely accused Him.  They were jealous of Him.  Read Matthew 21:33-41.  Israel knew Jesus was Gods son.  Also read John 11:45-53. This spirit hates Gods authority and refuses to surrender control.

To seduce in Revelation 2:20 means impostor or to mislead. What is this spirit doing in the Last Days Church? Notice verse 19. I know thy service.  This word is used of apostles, prophets and deacons as well as other gifts of the Spirit.

You see God has sent the spirit of Elijah the prophet to release fathers.   Was it not the prophets and the teachers who separated apostles in Antioch?  What did these apostles do but raise up sons.

Joel said in the Last Days God would pour out His Spirit on sons and daughters and would bring together the old and young men.

God is restoring true authority back to the church--His authority. But the spirit of Jezebel hates Gods authority. It is seducing Gods servants and misleading many. Where? In the Church.  It is happening in the man made authority structures.  You see kings were not Gods original plan, but the peoples plan.  They wanted a king. 

Today is no different. People want their way instead of Gods way.

But listen to the words of Jesus.  I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH.  WARNING! To all organizations, networks, denominations and churches, beware of Jezebel in the House of God.  She is an impostor, seducer and she is out to destroy Gods servants. God gives a space to repent. Run to the mercy seat. Cast out Jezebel who wants to control and dominate because she cannot cohabitate with Gods authority. 

She has been cast into a bed of sickness. . .probably an open flow venereal disease like the woman with the issue of blood.  This sickness stops conception, stops fruitfulness and brings death to the Church. Without apostles and prophets the church is sick, dying in stale doctrine.  There are no miracles.  There are no sons and daughters. Most organized structures of authority have built great institutions with many instructors.  But where are the fathers? Sons are crying out. God will hear their cry. Many will leave these structures that have Jezebel. And they will run to the river where John the Baptist is waiting with the spirit of Elijah. 

Which spirit will you come under?  Which spirit will teach you? He that hath an ear must hear and respond. May God grant you much more from this morsel of truth. Until next time, go with God and youll never go wrong.

Not to be rude or anything... but tell me you didn't type all four of

Not to be rude or discount your life experiences, but it's my humble

The link below is to a pics site that's hosting a number of panoramic views 
of Burning Man 2002.

The last shot, at night, is amazing. Look at 'em for a while, there's a lot 
in there (like a "Where's Waldo"!). Make sure you view 'em large. If you 
aren't scrolling Left/Right, you're looking at a small version.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: bush....

I think the U.S. is behaving exactly like the people the United Nations was 
designed to curtail. We are nullifying the validity of a world-wide peace 
keeping organization. Agreed, something should be done about the rising 
tension in the Middle East, but diplomacy is likely to work better than 
agression. This is not the fucking sandbox.

I think the U.S. may really be the Great Satan that we have been labeled. 
We've had our dirty, stinking fingers in everybody's pies since WWII. It 
truly is becoming the U.S. against the world, and the fight won't be pretty. 
We are dealing with groups of people who are truly ready to perish for their 
beliefs, and they aren't going to attack us straight on. Guerilla warfare is 
not only frightening, its also effective.

This impending war is not about the way the Saddam is violating the human 
rights of some of his people. Its not about the possibility of him building 
weapons of mass destruction. Its about "oil-pipeline-istan" The rhetoric we 
are hearing is chock full of red herrings and straw men. Anything and 
everything is being shoved down our throats in an attempt to distract us.

North Korea allegedly has two functioning nukes, and enough spent rods to 
produce an estimated five additional nukes. There are ICBMs in that neck of 
the woods too, even if they aren't possessed by North Korea. That is far, 
far scarier than some biological weapons that can possibly infect a city at 
a time.

Our freedoms are rapidly being erroded and we're being force fed pablum by 
the media in this country. The news services aren't stupid, they're just in 
the pocket of big business. Its lucrative for them and they know who keeps 
the lights on. Its not the people watching the news, its the people 
disseminating it.

George Dubya has managed to narrow the separation of church and state to a 
margin thinner than any president before him. He references the Lord 
Almighty almost every time he speaks about this "War on Terror" I am 
convinced that he honestly belives he is pursuing a manifest destiny 
bestowed on him by God himself.

Whether this immediately impending war with Iraq can be avoided or not, 
something that I highly doubt, we're still in trouble. The entire nature of 
"War on Terror" is worded so that there is never a foreseeable end possible. 
We as a people have given away rights and freedoms "in time of war" because 
we're willing to make major sacrifices during a time of crisis. Not only is 
Benjamin Franklin spinning in his grave so fast that they could run an 
electric generator off of him, this time of war can't end. There will always 
be terror in the world, and goddamn it, the United Fucking States is one of 
the biggest reasons that its the case. We are acting with complete autonomy 
as a nation, exerting our sovereignty over that of all others.

If there really are sleeper cells all over, in possession of serious 
biological weapons, I am afraid that a little duct tape and some plastic 
sheeting is not going to save us. The proverbial shit will already have hit 
the proverbial fan. Rioting will start in cities that haven't even been 
attacked yet. Martial law will have to be enacted, and if an invisible agent 
is killing people, anarchy will ensue.

Religion used to be the opiate of the masses, and because of that, it was a 
safe bet that people would behave and say their prayers when something scary 
like that happened. I believe that sports are now the opiate of the masses. 
Competitive, and often violent, sports are helping to form the mores of this 
country. Sports enthusiasts are not going to be quiet and say their prayers 
when everything is in shambles. The true nature of their character is going 
to come out.

We are a nation in decline. No other vast empire has lasted forever. What 
the hell makes anyone think this one can?

So no, I am not going to buy any plastic sheeting. And if they evacuate my 
building because of an anthrax scare, I'll be breathing deeply on my way 
home.

*calms down*

Heh. Please forgive me for the rant. Once I got started I just couldn't 
stop.

So ive actually spent sometime now watching television to see what kind of 
acts Bush is trying to push on the whole war against terrisom thing. I 
really cant decide if what he's doing is right or wrong at the moment.. and 
its getting to be kinda scary to me.. I know the media can hype up the 
"scare" a little because they're mostly idiots.

I'm honestly curious to hear what some of you guys are thinking about this 
whole controversy, and are you really making plans to stock up on goods 
(foods..etc)..

Subject: {pb-cle} quick note of thanks...

to any and all who showed up to Abbasso for
afterhours, thanks - I had a great night both behind
the decks and on the floor.  I got to pound dark nasty
tech house for nearly two hours and then had the
pleasure of listening to Adam toss down some killer
electro breaks for the remainder of the
evening...that, along with a reasonably good crowd
that stayed until almost 5am made my night.  can't
wait to do it again sometime in the not-too-distant
future.

I know this is on yahoo, but nobody noted it here yet
and it really pisses me off.  The asshole cops
responsible for this should be charged with
involuntary manslaughter, but the club will probably
take the blame for as many fire code violations as can
be generated.

--0-1900450293-1045503864=:11425
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


I've posted this on the Cleveland's nitty gritty site, but feel Jamie really deserves this...
I really have to give Jamie major props for Saturday's afterhours...and though I know Jamie, I honestly say this without any bias...he played one of the best sets I think I've ever heard from him. He opened his set (following a DJ with a VERY different style I might add) dropping cowgirl, and just set the mood for the rest of the evening. His track selections were absolutely awesome, and made for an energetic night. For those of you that have heard his prog. sets...this was definitely a harder, techy, edgier Jamie, and he pulled it off well. (and if you took a peek in the booth, the buttons/levels were flying) There was an awesome crowd that came down and STAYED for afterhours, and from the number of people enthusiastically dancing, or unable to sit still, appreciated his mixes. 


It was so great to see the place busy, and jumping... for me, truly a great night. If any of you reading this came down...Thank you. 'twas a blast. Honestly, a truly cool crowd of people came down...lots of true heads, and people with a great vibe.  

Also kudos to Adam Menzes, who it was so fun to see switch from the house at a private party at Mercury earlier in the night, to some crazy funky electro breaks later in the night.  Loved hearing Adam drop some different selections, and the rest of  crew did too.  Adam's got such an awesome personality, and it totally comes out when he plays.  Again, well appreciated by the crowd. 

all in all..awesome...awesome evening.

afterhours, thanks - I had a great night both behind
the decks and on the floor. I got to pound dark nasty
tech house for nearly two hours and then had the
pleasure of listening to Adam toss down some killer
electro breaks for the remainder of the
evening...that, along with a reasonably good crowd
that stayed until almost 5am made my night. can't
wait to do it again sometime in the not-too-distant
future.

Fuck.

Okay, if any of you are my friends and we happen to end up at either
of these places, no matter HOW DRUNK I get, please do *NOT LET ME*
show my boobs to the Girls Gone Wild crew! Ugh.

Perfect strangers buying my drinks is one thing, but I refuse to end
up on some lame jerk-off video.

Amanda

on the dnb list i said "it's happening no matter what" but my friends that

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Cleveland Music Festival

Cleveland Music Festivel is the reincarnation of some other event that took
place here for several years.  Basically, it is way for locla bands to get
exposure.  Electronic music just got added as an additional attraction.

Basically, a dj pays the festival a fee ($20?) so they get a chance to play
and get "discovered"

Peabody's paid the fee for many if not most of the dj's participating.

They promise that Steve Levy from Moonshine will be on hand, and possibly a
representative from AM_Only.

That's what I know.

The fee is actually $30, and then you're supposed to
pimp tickets (presumably to your friends) at $10
apiece...I suppose it's cool if you never get the
oppurtunity to play out.

=A0
At least 21 people have been killed and many others injured in a =20
stampede at a Chicago nightclub, police say.

Panic broke out when Mace or pepper spray was released into the air on =20=

the upper floor of the two-storey Epitome club on the city's South Side.



The dead are believed to have been trampled or crushed as people rushed =20=

for the exits, according to emergency workers.

Dozens of other people were injured - some critically - in the stampede =20=

at about 0200 local time (0800 GMT).

Fire Commander Will Knight said the total number of casualties was =20
unclear because many people with lesser injuries had been taken to =20
hospitals by family or friends.

One witness, Cory Thomas, was outside the Epitome club waiting to pick =20=

up two friends when he saw people inside the club being pushed up =20
against the glass front door.



"You could see a mound of people. People were stacking on top of each =20=

other, screaming and gagging, I guess from the pepper spray," he said.

"The door got blocked because there were too many people stacked up =20
against it," Mr Thomas added, quoted by Associated Press news agency.

Attack fears

Commander Knight, said the panic appears to have started when someone =20=

released pepper spray or Mace into the air in the early hours of Monday.

The club had been packed ahead of the Presidents' Day public holiday on =20=

Monday.



One report said the spray had been used by club security officers to =20
break up a fight among a group of young women.



A BBC correspondent in Washington says the high level of concern of a =20=

terrorist attack in the US - possibly using biological or chemical =20
weapons - may have added to the panic when the substance was sprayed.

Clubbers rushed down a staircase to try to get out. When some fell, the =20=

crowd simply poured on top of them, witnesses said.

Some reports said the crush may have been exacerbated because only one =20=

staircase was used and an exit door was blocked.

There had been more than 1,500 people in the Epitome Night Club at the =20=

time of the disaster, officials said.

Medical teams from local hospitals were sent to the club with =20
ambulances and paramedics to treat the casualties.

The incident is one of the deadliest of its kind in the United States.

In December 1979, 11 people were killed in Cincinnati in a crush to get =20=

into a concert by British rock group The Who.

In December 1991, nine people were crushed to death in a gymnasium =20
stairwell while awaiting a celebrity basketball game at New York's City =20=

College.

Maybe people have more important things to worry about now rather than
supporting the rave scene. People are growing up, getting educated and 
looking to find a good job. Its not the 90's anymore man.

Well, I'm not exactly sure what happened, but...

If there WERE a biological weapons attack, why would one, or a crowd of people, run OUTSIDE???

It's highly doubtful that Saadaam would start by targeting black-oriented nightclubs in Chi-town as
points of attack. Shit, Strom Thurmond and Trent Lott would go to Bagdhad and start handing out
hummers if Sadaam started picking off African-American hotspots.

>From http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2771641.stm:

At least 21 people have been killed and many others injured in a
stampede at a Chicago nightclub, police say.

Panic broke out when Mace or pepper spray was released into the air on
the upper floor of the two-storey Epitome club on the city's South Side.



The dead are believed to have been trampled or crushed as people rushed
for the exits, according to emergency workers.

Dozens of other people were injured - some critically - in the stampede
at about 0200 local time (0800 GMT).

Fire Commander Will Knight said the total number of casualties was
unclear because many people with lesser injuries had been taken to
hospitals by family or friends.

One witness, Cory Thomas, was outside the Epitome club waiting to pick
up two friends when he saw people inside the club being pushed up
against the glass front door.



"You could see a mound of people. People were stacking on top of each
other, screaming and gagging, I guess from the pepper spray," he said.

"The door got blocked because there were too many people stacked up
against it," Mr Thomas added, quoted by Associated Press news agency.

Attack fears

Commander Knight, said the panic appears to have started when someone
released pepper spray or Mace into the air in the early hours of Monday.

The club had been packed ahead of the Presidents' Day public holiday on
Monday.



One report said the spray had been used by club security officers to
break up a fight among a group of young women.



A BBC correspondent in Washington says the high level of concern of a
terrorist attack in the US - possibly using biological or chemical
weapons - may have added to the panic when the substance was sprayed.

Clubbers rushed down a staircase to try to get out. When some fell, the
crowd simply poured on top of them, witnesses said.

Some reports said the crush may have been exacerbated because only one
staircase was used and an exit door was blocked.

There had been more than 1,500 people in the Epitome Night Club at the
time of the disaster, officials said.

Medical teams from local hospitals were sent to the club with
ambulances and paramedics to treat the casualties.

The incident is one of the deadliest of its kind in the United States.

In December 1979, 11 people were killed in Cincinnati in a crush to get
into a concert by British rock group The Who.

In December 1991, nine people were crushed to death in a gymnasium
stairwell while awaiting a celebrity basketball game at New York's City
College.

record companies still sign djz???  and moonshine iz going to sign some
bedroom dj from cleveland??? sounds like a scam to me.

mean deiselboy iz going to be spinning on some half hour show during
spring break with those tittie chicks dancing around?  that would be
kewl... hahaha

February 28, 2003 :: Scarlet and Grey Cafe :: Columbus
Cooked Goose Productions presents:

Inclination Part Deux

Back in September we started a Friday night to celebrate the broken =
beat.  This Edition of Inclination is featuring the finer sides of House =
and Techno.

Jason "Lemon" Lyman-(Godown, Brique Rouge Traxx, PCP)
10 years of experience under his belt and a wicked selection of House =
music destined to make you dance.  Jason is returning for his second =
Inclination appearance

Mike Salamon - (On the Floor, Polyphonic, DMBL) Columbus=20
Fresh back from a fall trip to Europe, Mike filled up his record bag =
with some great techno that you just don't find here in the states all =
that often.  He'll definately be dropping a pleasurable flavor of =
intelligent music stylings.

Goose - (Cooked Goose, DMBL) Columbus
I whore myself out to diversity, but I always carry really cheesy music =
in my bag if I'm feeling playful.  It's pretty much up in the air what =
style I'll choose to drop to open the night up, but it will probably be =
either breakbeat or house based stylings, but I've had an itch to drop a =
downtempo hip hop set of old school... who knows?

Scarlet and Grey Cafe
2203 N High Street (corner of Norwich and High)
$3 for 21+, $5 for 18-20 (bar adds 2 dollars for each underage head)

-Goose

** This is the same night that Titonton's crew throws their monthly =
breakbeat night at Standard Lounge.  I encourage you if you do not want =
to attend my event to please support his event, it is the hot stuff in =
columbus and well worth the drive from whereever you are.  I would not =
have thrown this event had it not been the only date available to me at =
the venue.  I would also like to suggest a compromise.  Titonton's event =
starts at 10/10:30, mine starts at 9/9:30.  If you come early to catch =
my set, and let me know that you are headed out to titonton's event, =
I'll buy your first drink (so in essence you came out for free) **

that cyantific tune is definately one of my top tunes at the mo. not feelin' the zed bias bit as much, production quality isn't as tight, as least by my taste.

if you like this check out "keep it coming" by the cookie monsters on the new generation vol.1 ep on infrared recordings. somewhat similar style. a little bit more of a rolling vibe, with some wicked vocal bits. cookie monsters is rumoured to be ed rush & optical's secret new guise. quite a different sound for them, but very refreshing!

  With a knack for merging many influences from Electro, Classic Italo-Disco, and 70's/80's film scores (John Carpenter Dario Argento films for example), Blanco has been producing and releasing top notch tracks at every turn since 1998, while crafting his own original blend of dark & dirty electro disco funk.  

 

  In the past two years Blanco has kicked his production output into high gear contributing to somewhere around 90 tracks.  The past two years have also been a busy year for Legowelt performances, having performed a countless number of events all over the world armed to the teeth with a large arsenal of new and vintage gear. 

 

From Milan To The Hague as sung on his hot hot hit Disco Rout, originally released on Detroit based Ghostly Internationals compilation, Tangent 2002 : Disco Nouveau.  Since its release Disco Rout has caught the attention of many people within the electronic dance music community including Richie Hawtin and Sven Vath who opted to license the track for releases on Vaths Cocoon Records.  One being Richie Hawtin & Sven Vaths recent mix CD, The Sound Of The Third Season and the other a Disco Rout 12 featuring the original track and a remix by Johannes Heil.  Legowelt has also contributed to the Cocoon label with a remix of Sven Vaths track Designer Music.

 

The song Disco Rout also caught the attention of the Lobo design group who put together a very stylish video to go along with the track.

Aside from his solo projects Blanco has also been blessed with a very supportive and talented group of friends and label mates who by working together bring new and amazing projects to the table on a regular basis.  These projects include and feature:

         Legowelt & Orgue Electronique w/ Orgue Electronique

         Macho Cat Garage w/ Orgue Electronique

         Catnip w/ Stilleben Records Luke Eargoggle

         Mr. Clavio w/ Crmes TLR

         Atari Mega ST1 running Cubase

 

It is quite amazing to see all that Mr.Blanco has accomplished while keeping his integrity intact, staying true to his underground and independent roots by keeping the majority of his output exclusive to independent labels such as Bunker, Crme Organization, Clone, Stilleben, Viewlexx, and Downlow, labels which refuse to exploit music for their personal gain by using trendy media terms.  This is why Experimedia Communications has chosen to dub Legowelt aka: Danny Blanco with its first ever award: Electronic Musics Hardest Working Producer of 2002. Expect to see nothing but hard work and continuous quality releases from this talented individual far into the future.

 

For those of you living in the United States like myself you will have the opportunity to catch Mr.Blanco in action along with his equally talented Crme Organization & Bunker Records label mates Orgue Electronique, Bangkok Impact, Kasson, and DJ TLR.  The Crme Organization 2003 US will take place during late April / early May and will stop in major cities from the East to West coast.

I'll be there for sure and bringing 2 or 3 friends whose party it will 
be there first, or first REAL party that hopefully wont be shiest ( I 
hope i dont have to fucking babysit). But yes indeed, dj Rap being 
molested by flying chocolate bars is gonna be the highlight of my 
evening....ooo how I wish I was a Twix candy. This will also be MY 
first time seeing Charles Feelgood live, so it just might be a twin 
packed treat ;- )

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr:  soundcard trouble

if your computer doesn't turn on at all then you have a bad soundcard
if you remove your soundcard and your computer still doesn't turn on 
then your fried your motherboard while putting it in
if windows refuses to boot then you probobly have bad drivers, look for 
updated ones online

Thanks to everyone who came out last night to see AK1200 in Kent. It was a 
great time and even AK said it was one of the best vibes hes felt from a 
crowd in awhile.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Ak1200 Thanks!

I enjoyed myself out last night!   It has been awhile since I have had
some time to get out.  I even brought a friend out just after he got in
from Newport Beach California...  he quickly found out Versace clothing
isn't as popular here in the clubs here as in LA!

Good seeing everyone last night... hopefully I can make it out more as
school and work permits.

Thanks Matt and the rest of the Control The Night gang for putting
together great events!

Risin' up, back on the street
Took my time, took my chances
Went the distance
Now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times, it happened too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge
Of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And his fortune must always be
Eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds
Still we take to the street
Fot the kill with the skill to survive

Risin' up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance
Now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

The bad news on this is that Kent State, in their infinite wisdom, has
decided to close that lot at night. If worst comes to worst you can
always park behind Huntington on the other side of the hill.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Parking at Rebirth

i've always been told by the robin hood staff to poark in the mexican
resturant's parking lot... i believe the place is called Chipoltipe... er...
Chupacabra? haha.

I saw a thing on the news today about KSU toughening up on parking in their
lots for parties so i wouldn't advise parking on school property.


Chipoltipe is on the other side of Papa Johns.

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran 
of the Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical
journey in the late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and 
jazz/fusion bands which helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. 
After a short stint in the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to 
the electronic dance scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. 
"Once I started getting into producing dance music, 
I finally felt I was on the right track to where I wanted to be musically. 
My reputation as a cutting edge producer, and later as a DJ, steadily 
grew,
and so did the work.

Labeled "The Godfather of Chicago Drum and Bass", 3D is the pioneer of 
American Jungle Producers. The first to ever have his dub-plates
rewound in a UK DJ's set and has out sold any other DJ or Producer in the 
USA.
A total of over 80 SELF PRODUCED tracks and remixes on countless labels

The closest Paul has come to Ohio has been Chicago. It speaks volumes for 
our scene that he would come to play. If you look at his past gigs you 
will see that Columbus is by far the smallest city in North America that 
Paul has ever played. Thank you for helping me make this possible.

Now with that being said. This event is being promoted throughout the 
entire midwest. Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania & Ohio. I higly 
recommend getting your presale tickets NOW because there is the strong 
possibility of this event selling out. We are talking with both 
Ticketmaster and ticketweb and we will have them online with one of the 
services by the end of this week.
Presales start at only $25.

Forever, Cluster, and Smitten, his releases can also be found gracing a
greater variety of labels such as Molecular, Techno Slut, Eukatech, 12"

and many collaborations with long-term partners that include Chris
Liberator, Lawrie Immersion, Geezer, and Kris Needs.

GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well present
One Love
Northeast, OH - February 22, 2003

The production tandem of GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well trek north with 
some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, New York, Florida, California and many other states 
representing. This is an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio 
and see how much of a great scene we are and what we can produce if we 
cooperate. We have selected many dj's and have gotten full support from 
surrounding crews to bring you the following crowd rockers:

_Dj Rap_(Proper Talent)_L.A.
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live 
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londons Charissa Saverio, aka DJ 
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes 
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female, 
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of 
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent, 
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via 
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of 
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the 
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and 
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)_L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back 
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and 
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC 
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As 
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the 
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene." To this day, Feelgood remains 
one of the most beloved DJs in the country. From Coast to Coast and from 
week to week he can be seen spinning at landmark clubs such as Twilo, 
Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild popularity overseas. With 
Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak hour house sets only one 
question remains - Can You Feel It?

FIRST NORTHERN OHIO APPEARANCE!
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_( Hallucination Recordings / GrooveFuel AM )_Miami, 
FL

Icey and Baby Anne have brought his tracks to Ohio countless times but, 
the hour is finally near for Ohio to welcome the true prognosticator of 
Florida breakbeat and mayhem, Jackal. Best known for his involvement in 
the electro-core tandem of Jackal & Hyde, producer/performer Scott Weiser 
is nothing short of a living legend in electronic music. His most recent 
contribution to breakbeat and house heads across the world: Jackal 
Digital Mix Set - an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the 
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids because Jackal is coming to town.

Scott Weiser (Jackal) needs no introduction, both of his groups Jackal & 
Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables 
from Los Angeles to Berlin. -URB MAGAZINE

_FACTORe_( 20KFreaks / GrooveFuel AM )_Birmingham, AL

The staple of the 20kFreaks label, FACTORe is one of the most talented and 
respected breatbeat DJs and producers in the industry. Behind the decks 
since the early 80s, he's been ripping it since most of you were in 
diapers. When FACTORe throws down his pounding breakbeat, there won't be 
an ass that isn't shakin'. Come experience the past, present, and future 
of breakbeat as FACTORe brings his signature style and class on the CUT N 
DROP Tour. The tour was first named the "All The Tracks We Produced That

sat. Feb. 22
shift

jeff samuel  seattle
Lo-Fi Stereo, 7th City, Tektite

Jeff Samuel has been a DJ for 7 years and is known across the midwestern 
United States for his unique style of mixing. His music choices range from 
the funky quirk! s he is known for in his productions to deeper tech-house 
and more intense techno stylings. Jeff changes his style of mixing to fit 
the mood of the music and the atmosphere. Whether it is smooth long mixes 
or quick cuts and fader tricks, Jeff Samuel is the DJ that always delivers 
the funk proper!
Growing up in Cleveland, Jeff Samuel did not listen to Tangerine Dream or 
Skinny Puppy. After his aunt spotted him singing a KISS song before he 
could speak, his family decided that he was musically inclined. Quickly 
after completing his first demo he was signed to Frankfurt's Lo-Fi Stereo 
Recordings in 1999. His eccentric, funky and blipped out style soon caught 
the attention of Daniel Bell, who signed him to 7th City.
The German mag de:bug called Jeff Samuel "...an American counterpart to 
Dr. Rockit" and his records consistently receive high marks among 
magazines such as Groove. Though despite his German accolades, he swears 
to have "...very little to do with David Hasselhoff".

February 28, 2003 :: Scarlet and Grey Cafe :: Columbus
Cooked Goose Productions presents:

Inclination Part Deux

Back in September we started a Friday night to celebrate the broken beat.  
This Edition of Inclination is featuring the finer sides of House and 
Techno.

Jason "Lemon" Lyman-(Godown, Brique Rouge Traxx, PCP)
10 years of experience under his belt and a wicked selection of House 
music destined to make you dance.  Jason is returning for his second 
Inclination appearance

Mike Salamon - (DMBL) Columbus 
Fresh back from a fall trip to Europe, Mike filled up his record bag with 
some great techno that you just don't find here in the states all that 
often.  He'll definately be dropping a pleasurable flavor of intelligent 
music stylings.

Goose - (Cooked Goose, DMBL) Columbus
I whore myself out to diversity, but I always carry really cheesy music in 
my bag if I'm feeling playful.  It's pretty much up in the air what style 
I'll choose to drop to open the night up, but it will probably be either 
breakbeat or house based stylings, but I've had an itch to drop a 
downtempo hip hop set of old school... who knows?

Scarlet and Grey Cafe
2203 N High Street (corner of Norwich and High)
$3 for 21+, $5 for 18-20 (bar adds 2 dollars for each underage head)

D8A: SPECIAL OLD SCHOOL ACID HOUSE SET - www.groovereactor.com, Buckwyld - 
Dayton, OH - Over time, D8A has developed a unique style that always 
pleases. Ranging from the hardest hitting house and on into harder German 
techno/ trance, you can always expect to see the crowd dancing during his 
sets. Tonight though, D8A is preparing a special treat NOT TO BE MISSED. 
He will be dropping an ultra-rare acid house set with some of those 
long-ago heard gems and recent underground acid tracks that will truly 
take you BACK TO THE BASICS. If you were around in the glory days of acid 
house and like the older styles of DJ Pierre or Terry Mullan, this will be 
the set you've been wanting to hear!

NELSON: www.glasscityrecords.com / Black Sun Entertainment - Funky Disco 
House, Toledo, OH - Nelson is one of the biggest supporters and proponents 
of the NW, Ohio scene and he's developed the scene into something special. 
Including the launch of his own Glass City Records, his NW, Ohio message 
board www.glasscityrecords.com and his successful run of club and one-off 
events, it's no wonder the word is quickly spreading. His funky-filtered 
house sounds will surely keep everyone begging for more.

MATT ROBERTS: Unpredictable Entertainment / Glass City Records - Techno - 
Toledo, OH - Matt will be bringing some down the hard techno sounds from 
Toledo and will be drawing on the Detroit influences who have made the 
sound what it is today. Plenty of wicked drum codes and percussion, 
combined with his flawless mixing will surely help to set the tone of the 
party.

CATNAP vs. DEF LEPER: Mecha Studios - Hardcore, Gabber, Who Knows - 
Columbus & Springfield, OH - There is no question that when these two take 
the stage the sparks will fly. Expect to be entertained with audio and 
visual sensations of hardcore, gabber, and noisecore and a little bit of 
everything in between. Plenty of people have asked for another tag team 
between these two see get here early to hear them duke it out!

OOMPA LOOMPA: Trance - Cincinnati, OH - Oompa has made quite a name for 
himself this past year and the demand to see him spin increases every 
weekend. He brought some major bombs down at Bumpin and Jumpin 2 and it's 
our pleasure to bring him in again for some more mayhem!

SATURDAY MARCH 1st, 2003:

ROMANOWSKI
(Future Primitive Sound, The Curators, San Francisco)

www.futureprimitivesound.com
www.thecurators.com
www.romanowski45.com

Dj Romanowski is a riddle wrapped inside an enigma, dressed up in 
thrift-shop finery. While many DJ's play vintage music, Romanowski's whole 
life is an expression of vintage values. Though born in Switzerland, 
Roman's world springs from the Haight & Ashbury district of San Francisco. 
His image is very much a man living in the present, he just seems to have 
saved the best he could find from the past. You can hear it in the music 
he produces for Future Primitive Sound. It sounds like it's made of old 
samples but the way the brakes are organized, the incredible scratching, 
and the off wall composition is cutting edge. His music is designed for 
the funk and hip-hop fan, or better yet, for the person who digs dance 
music but may not like the fact that much of it sounds like shit.

Sat Mar 29                ANALOGUE HEAVEN MIDWEST V              NE Indiana

[not music, but gear related]

Analogue Heaven MidWest 2003

"The Voyager Home"
Official Information

The FIFTH annual AHMW get-together will be Saturday, March 29th at the 
PHHS Auditorium. I'll be there by 9:00 am. Who knows what time (or day) it 
will be when we're done :) All synthgeekgearheads are encouraged to join 
us and spend some time with awesome gear and great people.

AHMW 2003 is held in NE Indiana, midway between three empires of synth 
music: Detroit, Chicago, and... uh... Dayton!

MAP #1 shows the location relative to Interstate 69 and the Indiana Toll 
Road.
MAP #2 shows the close-up view of where to park for easy gear unloading.

Please bring a $5 - $10 "Free will" donation to help pay for auditorium 
rental

The exact address is 245 S 1150 E, Lagrange, IN 46795
If you need help getting here, just email me.
drew@ph.k12.in.us

What to bring:
* Your cool synths
* Long extension cords and power strips
* Audio cables, small mixer and headphones
* Camera!

With so many synths begging to be played, headphones are ideal for 
exploring all the different instruments people bring.
I have a PA for the performances. Anyone wishing to bring additional PA 
equipment will be welcomed to do so :)

Performances:
Live performances of all kinds are encouraged. There are plans underway to 
record them and burn AHMW2003 CD's.
We should probably try to sync up a jam session as well :)

Food:
We will collect orders and $ for lunch and dinner. Lunch will be 
sandwiches from the Lagrange Subway, and dinner will be Papa John's pizza. 
Feel free to bring your own if you wish. There are a couple nearby 
restaurants and gas stations, but not much. Angola and Lagrange have 
McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. PHHS is a rural school.

Also, since this is a school building, consumption of alcohol on the 
grounds is illegal, and smoking is not permitted inside.


A few of the local motels would be:

Ramada Inn (R on map #1) North of Angola at I69 exit 154
$89 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9471
has restaurant, bar, indoor pool and sauna

Best Western (W on map #1) At Highway 20 and I69 exit 148
$65 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9165

Super 8 (S on map #1) At Indiana Toll Road, Howe exit
$60 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-562-2828

Holiday Inn (H on map #1) At Indiana Toll Road, Howe exit
$79 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-562-3660

I can't tell you much about these, having never stayed at any of them. 
Several people stayed at the Best Western last year...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} One Love

I got the faxed memo about the cover sheets for the TPS reports, but I don't 
think I received the Twix memo. Anyone care to clue me in? Someone also 
jokingly mentioned getting "half and half" from DJ Rap about a year or so 
ago. I don't get that one either.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Liberator, Lawrie Immersion, Geezer, and Kris Needs.

GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well present
One Love
Northeast, OH - February 22, 2003

The production tandem of GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well trek north with 
some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, New York, Florida, California and many other states 
representing. This is an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio 
and see how much of a great scene we are and what we can produce if we 
cooperate. We have selected many dj's and have gotten full support from 
surrounding crews to bring you the following crowd rockers:

_Dj Rap_(Proper Talent)_L.A.
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live 
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londons Charissa Saverio, aka DJ 
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes 
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female, 
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of 
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent, 
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via 
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of 
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the 
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and 
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)_L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back 
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and 
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC 
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As 
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the 
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene." To this day, Feelgood remains 
one of the most beloved DJs in the country. From Coast to Coast and from 
week to week he can be seen spinning at landmark clubs such as Twilo, 
Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild popularity overseas. With 
Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak hour house sets only one 
question remains - Can You Feel It?

Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables

an ass that isn't shakin'. Come experience the past, present, and future 
of breakbeat as FACTORe brings his signature style and class on the CUT N 
DROP Tour. The tour was first named the "All The Tracks We Produced That 
You Thought Were Icey's" Tour, but, turned out that CUT N DROP was a lot 
shorter and fit on the record.

jeff samuel  seattle
Lo-Fi Stereo, 7th City, Tektite

Jeff Samuel has been a DJ for 7 years and is known across the midwestern 
United States for his unique style of mixing. His music choices range from 
the funky quirk! s he is known for in his productions to deeper tech-house 
and more intense techno stylings. Jeff changes his style of mixing to fit 
the mood of the music and the atmosphere. Whether it is smooth long mixes 
or quick cuts and fader tricks, Jeff Samuel is the DJ that always delivers 
the funk proper!
Growing up in Cleveland, Jeff Samuel did not listen to Tangerine Dream or 
Skinny Puppy. After his aunt spotted him singing a KISS song before he 
could speak, his family decided that he was musically inclined. Quickly 
after completing his first demo he was signed to Frankfurt's Lo-Fi Stereo 
Recordings in 1999. His eccentric, funky and blipped out style soon caught 
the attention of Daniel Bell, who signed him to 7th City.
The German mag de:bug called Jeff Samuel "...an American counterpart to 
Dr. Rockit" and his records consistently receive high marks among 
magazines such as Groove. Though despite his German accolades, he swears 
to have "...very little to do with David Hasselhoff".

reputation for their unmistakable sound while still keeping their

February 28, 2003 :: Scarlet and Grey Cafe :: Columbus
Cooked Goose Productions presents:

Inclination Part Deux

Back in September we started a Friday night to celebrate the broken beat.  
This Edition of Inclination is featuring the finer sides of House and 
Techno.

Jason "Lemon" Lyman-(Godown, Brique Rouge Traxx, PCP)
10 years of experience under his belt and a wicked selection of House 
music destined to make you dance.  Jason is returning for his second 
Inclination appearance

Mike Salamon - (DMBL) Columbus 
Fresh back from a fall trip to Europe, Mike filled up his record bag with 
some great techno that you just don't find here in the states all that 
often.  He'll definately be dropping a pleasurable flavor of intelligent 
music stylings.

Goose - (Cooked Goose, DMBL) Columbus
I whore myself out to diversity, but I always carry really cheesy music in 
my bag if I'm feeling playful.  It's pretty much up in the air what style 
I'll choose to drop to open the night up, but it will probably be either 
breakbeat or house based stylings, but I've had an itch to drop a 
downtempo hip hop set of old school... who knows?

Scarlet and Grey Cafe
2203 N High Street (corner of Norwich and High)
$3 for 21+, $5 for 18-20 (bar adds 2 dollars for each underage head)

On this night, we will revive the series that started it all - BACK TO THE 
BASICS! This event is exactly that - a return to the old school. We've 
secured an intimate 1 room venue, an awesome sound system, a killer lineup 
and the kind of old school atmosphere and decorations that got a lot of us 
into the scene long ago. We will be giving away hundreds of copies of 
D8A's newest CD, and we will be powering our evening's visuals with 
another laser to blow you away.

SATURDAY MARCH 1st, 2003:

ROMANOWSKI
(Future Primitive Sound, The Curators, San Francisco)

www.futureprimitivesound.com
www.thecurators.com
www.romanowski45.com

Dj Romanowski is a riddle wrapped inside an enigma, dressed up in 
thrift-shop finery. While many DJ's play vintage music, Romanowski's whole 
life is an expression of vintage values. Though born in Switzerland, 
Roman's world springs from the Haight & Ashbury district of San Francisco. 
His image is very much a man living in the present, he just seems to have 
saved the best he could find from the past. You can hear it in the music 
he produces for Future Primitive Sound. It sounds like it's made of old 
samples but the way the brakes are organized, the incredible scratching, 
and the off wall composition is cutting edge. His music is designed for 
the funk and hip-hop fan, or better yet, for the person who digs dance 
music but may not like the fact that much of it sounds like shit.

Sat Mar 29                ANALOGUE HEAVEN MIDWEST V              NE Indiana

[not music, but gear related]

Analogue Heaven MidWest 2003

"The Voyager Home"
Official Information

The FIFTH annual AHMW get-together will be Saturday, March 29th at the 
PHHS Auditorium. I'll be there by 9:00 am. Who knows what time (or day) it 
will be when we're done :) All synthgeekgearheads are encouraged to join 
us and spend some time with awesome gear and great people.

AHMW 2003 is held in NE Indiana, midway between three empires of synth 
music: Detroit, Chicago, and... uh... Dayton!

MAP #1 shows the location relative to Interstate 69 and the Indiana Toll 
Road.
MAP #2 shows the close-up view of where to park for easy gear unloading.

Please bring a $5 - $10 "Free will" donation to help pay for auditorium 
rental

The exact address is 245 S 1150 E, Lagrange, IN 46795
If you need help getting here, just email me.
drew@ph.k12.in.us

What to bring:
* Your cool synths
* Long extension cords and power strips
* Audio cables, small mixer and headphones
* Camera!

With so many synths begging to be played, headphones are ideal for 
exploring all the different instruments people bring.
I have a PA for the performances. Anyone wishing to bring additional PA 
equipment will be welcomed to do so :)

Performances:
Live performances of all kinds are encouraged. There are plans underway to 
record them and burn AHMW2003 CD's.
We should probably try to sync up a jam session as well :)

Food:
We will collect orders and $ for lunch and dinner. Lunch will be 
sandwiches from the Lagrange Subway, and dinner will be Papa John's pizza. 
Feel free to bring your own if you wish. There are a couple nearby 
restaurants and gas stations, but not much. Angola and Lagrange have 
McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. PHHS is a rural school.

Also, since this is a school building, consumption of alcohol on the 
grounds is illegal, and smoking is not permitted inside.


A few of the local motels would be:

Ramada Inn (R on map #1) North of Angola at I69 exit 154
$89 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9471
has restaurant, bar, indoor pool and sauna

Best Western (W on map #1) At Highway 20 and I69 exit 148
$65 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9165

I can't tell you much about these, having never stayed at any of them. 
Several people stayed at the Best Western last year...

Kinky!

Haha, my one roomate in college first told us she was a virgin, then
later decanted. When pressed to elaborate, she explained that she

Subject: {pb-cle} projekthaus

Do you remember the projekthaus parties of 1996 and 1997?
If you remember the parties and you remember the directions, you are
invited to The Eides of March.

It will take place at the projekthaus on March 15th from 8pm til 2am.

The DJs will be:
mskw1
Dan Strange
Count Zero
Ryan Walsh

Because quite a few projects have taken place at the projekthaus, please
don't expect the ghetto environs of old.  Act accordingly.  We've worked
hard on this place and the carelessness and disrespect of (some) past
guests will not be tolerated.  This party is BYOB but we will expect our
guests to act responsibility.  (We do NOT want to hose off the porch after
this one!) 

Jenifer Foulmood
mskw1
                    Work like you don't need the money.
                     Love like you've never been hurt.
                       Dance like nobody's watching.
		        Sing like you want to live.

INDEC?SIVE has brought together two very great genre's of jungle, ragga and 
jump up, which are not heard out often. She has a need to stand out a bit 
and not follow the crowd. She believes that every great DJ should play what 
makes them happy and uplifts you, and not worry what the rest of the crowd 
thinks. Even though she has only been spinning for a short while, she has 
definitely got the skill and style to make the crowd go wild. She currently 
has a weekly
show on www.jungletrain.net, Back 2 Classicz, on Wednesday nights from 8pm 
to 11pm EST.

Tune in every week to hear underground music being mixed live

I think that decriminalization is a good thing, as I have mentioned before. 
The thing that gets me though, is the fact that this (and other policies 
like it) is legislation at a state level. Meanwhile, the draconian drug laws 
are at the federal level. Is there any impact of a state law in that case, 
or only when it is challenged? Is it more of a temperature gauge rather than 
an actual step forward?

If you go to drugpolicy.org, it explains everything in more detail.  It also
has the new rave act and how you can fax your senator to let him know that
you maybe against it.

I hope the this will be clarified when the Supreme Court gets its
hands on the recent California case where state-sponsered medical
marajuana grower Ed Rosenthal was convicted of dealing enormous
quatities of drugs (even though they were drugs for dying cancer
patients and the mayor of of San Fransisco was 100% behind him).

Many of the jurors have come forward to say they deeply regret
convicting him, saying they were intetionally misled into believe
Rosenthal was some kind of drug lord rather than a supplier of
*medical* pot.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} New Mexico

there are two considerations here.  first, under the u.s. constitution, 
all powers are reserved to the states except those specifically assumed 
by the federal government.  the ideal under the constitution is that 
the states retain the lion's share of power.  obviously, that has been 
continually eroded in one way or another.  the most common method the 
feds use in the constitution is the commerce clause (which essentially 
says that matters involving, or which could in some way involve, 
commerce (another broad term) between two or more states, falls under 
the feds).

most commonly, the feds assume control over state issues by predicating 
federal funding for various programs on the state's willingness to 
conform it's laws to what the feds want.  for instance, all states now 
have a drinking age of 21 so they don't lose federal highway funding.

since the feds are so involved in medicare/medicade funding, they have 
control over state pocketbooks... states and hospitals get LOTS of 
funding from those federal programs.  feds also control drug licensing 
(FDA) and prescription drugs.  for a state not to 'give in' to the feds 
would be difficult, if not impossible.

secondly, there is separate federal law on drugs wholly distinct from 
state drug laws.  generally, the feds don't worry about the little 
street dealers but go after the big guys.  however, for the same drug 
sale, for instance, you can be prosecuted criminally and receive 2 
separate sentences, in both state and federal court... double jeopardy 
only attaches for multiple trials in the same court and state and 
federal court are different.

there are lots of ways that the feds are going to weasel their way into 
this issue.  however, since both state and federal governments no 
longer seem to legislate the wishes of the constituents which they 
serve, but rather legislate morality or common sense, where this all 
will go is up in the air.  of course, bush's picks to fill the many 
vacancies on ALL federal courts are incredibly conservative.  since a 
federal judge has lifetime tenure, his legacy will likely continue for 
a very, very long time.

in this case, even if a state would legalise any drug, the federal 
criminal laws will still stand.

Subject: {pb-cle} Another deadly club event

A tragic record stood for less than a week. Only 4 days after 21 people were 
killed in a club stampede, it happened again. This time 65 people were 
trambled, suffocated, and/or burned to death.

http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/02/21/deadly.nightclub.fire/index.html

Two things come to mind...

1) Fire marshalls really do have legitimate reasons when they seem to hassle 
our parties.

2) People are still willing to pay money to see Great Fucking White?


Not only did these people pay to see a cock rock band, they were burned 
alive. I am not positive which experience sucks more. (poor taste)

you know what, lighting pyrotechnics in a small club is not a bright idea.
i can't say i've ever been to a rave with pyrotechnics. 
house parties with fireworks outside, yes.  raves, no.

its funny that some of these bands are still touring.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Another deadly club event

*** As much as I know it's in poor taste to post this, I feel it is
my duty to do so anyway:


NEW YORK -- Tragedy struck at a popular Manhattan nightclub Saturday,

when the roof, the roof, the roof of The Tunnel caught fire,
collapsing and killing 43 party people. 

According to fire-department officials, the death toll was
exacerbated by the clubgoers' unwillingness to evacuate the burning
building.

"I tried shouting to the people on the dance floor that the roof was
on fire and that they should exit the premises immediately, but they
seemed unfazed by the danger," firefighter Michael Pitti said. "I
just kept shouting, 'The roof! The roof! The roof is on fire!' and so
forth, but they just went right on dancing, insisting that they
didn't need any of our water and that we should let the motherfucker
burn." 

The party people's refusal to exit the flame-engulfed nightclub is 
widely believed to have been the result of DJ Phreek Malik's
unstoppable mix of the hottest house, funk, hip-hop, disco, jungle
and techno beats.

"DJ Phreek Malik was spinning in a manner so hot, these party people 
were willing to give up their lives for a few extra minutes on the
dance floor," New York City fire commissioner Thomas Von Essen said.
"Even as a 50-foot-high wall of flames surged toward them, they
continued to dance, throwing their hands in the air and waving them
as if they just didn't care." 

As flames continued to fill the nightclub, firefighters frantically 
urged the revelers to keep low to the ground to avoid smoke
inhalation, but the warnings were universally ignored. 

"I was screaming at the top of my lungs, 'Get down! Get down, party 
people!'" said Garry Hodges of Ladder Company 42, "but the more I
shouted out, the harder they danced." 

Though an FDNY investigation is still pending, the deadly blaze is 
believed to have begun at 11:40 p.m., when a roof-mounted ventilation
system short-circuited, igniting the motherfucker. The fire is New
York's deadliest since 1978, when 117 party people burned, baby,
burned to death in a South Bronx disco inferno.

Bad taste aside, that is friggin hilarious.

"...they just went right on dancing, insisting that they didn't need any of

"...they continued to dance, throwing their hands in the air and waving them

BUWAAHAAAHAAAHA!

Three comments on that, all in incredibly poor taste:

1.  Actually, i'd be willing to bet that it was
actually rather bright...so bright that it could
probably be seen for miles around.

2.  The club booked Great White.  I don't think I'd
expect its management to qualify as 'bright', at least
not in the context of mental capacity.

3.  Go figure this happened at a show that probably
could have boasted the greatest average per-cranium
volume of aqua-net in the new england states on that
particular evening.

Bitter, sarcastic, and stuck at work,

This is an incredible point you're making. There would be massive amounts of 
hair spray on the audience members, both men and women. It isn't likely to 
have acted as an accelerant to the point of burning down the building 
faster, but you know that shit isn't flame retardant. I wonder if a couple 
of casualties could have been eliminated if this were a leather bar with 
lots of bald, gay men.

There were some great pyrotechnics at Control 4 last year in Detroit. The place was pretty small and overcrowded which makes it no surprise that it was shut down around 4am.

Knowing some about pyrotechnics from being friends with a few diff pyro
people, it sounds on the offset like they were being really cheap.  Most
pyro uses what's called cold sparks to avoid just this sort of thing.

Subject: RE: Re: {pb-cle} Another deadly club event

that's what I was thinking.  They make indoor-safe pyros.  like all 
that stuff when you watch wrestling.  You can litterally run your 
hand through the sparks and not be bothered in the least bit (except 
maybe it being really bright).  I figured that a spark must have got 
on something combustible, not sure if even cold sparks can prevent 
that.

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Irene

I've been checking out some of her mixes recently and I'm really 
digging them.  It will literally start out with hardcore stuff, then 
go into hard house, then trance, then back to house, but it doesn't 
sound like a radio station.  Just *cough cough* 'obtained' 
Phonosynthesis via a 'laser beam' on a cd-r :D  Had to put it on cd 
because there are 29 tracks and even the gapless output plugins for 
winamp don't work 100% reliably.  It would be cool to see her 
somewhere, but she probably carries with her a hefty price tag... ohh 
well.  stuff I like so far (and shared on my slsk account):

Phonosynthesis
Audio Underground
Global House Diva 2 (live)

Global House Diva 1 (haven't listend to this one yet)

I just talked with DJ D8A about an hour and a half ago, and he said that 
Brandon (Wishing Well Prod.) hasn't gotten with him yet about what time he 
is supposed to be spinning.  He said that he is just going to show up around 
9:00 just to be on the safe side.

OK, I'm tired, so I'm making this short.  It rocked. voight compf 
(however you spell that) was the definate highlight of the nite.  
Although kinda disapointed that I saw all these people with promo 
cd's and I didn't get a single one :-/  ohh well.

Hopefully everyone got home ok, the roads SUCKED.  Not even the 
turnpike was all that good.  Was cool that everyone was helping each 
other, though.  Like while I was picking at the ice on my car, there 
were people pushing a car up this small hill.  Also let a group use 
my ice scrappers.

I think I took around 50 pics I'll get posted sometime.  Right now 
I'm going to bed :)

Very nice party, but I had some minor personal setbacks. Roads were 
indeed shitty, and I left around 4 AM, didnt even stick around but went 
outside to my car before Rap finished, even though she was play some 
pretty nice chunes. The guy before her was rockin too, and my o my, 
Voight Kampf or wutever was impressive once again. Very sweet! Where 
are they from again? I'm pretty damn sore and will maybe make a full

hey eberhart alien g ride here..... during this
promotional period from flyers being let out last
weekend up thru feb 28, $20 presale packages are
being sold via the website for admission to both
nights... during certain times of a business day,
our web maintenancing and order processing might
prevent entry to the website...or your computer
may be lacking a competent flash plugin.....
otherwise you may need to enter the site using
secure connection settings on the browser's
internet options with ssl & others ....hope these
thoughts give you a solution brother... the
events and forum links work if you are
specifically wondering why downloads gallery and
other site directions are not yet available......
peace 4 now gonzales from euphorix profunk :)

Do you remember the projekthaus parties of 1996 and 1997?
If you remember the parties and you remember the directions, you 
are
invited to The Eides of March.

It will take place at the projekthaus on March 15th from 8pm til 
2am.

The DJs will be:
mskw1
Dan Strange
Count Zero
Ryan Walsh

Because quite a few projects have taken place at the projekthaus, 
please
don't expect the ghetto environs of old.  Act accordingly.  We've 
worked
hard on this place and the carelessness and disrespect of (some) 
past
guests will not be tolerated.  This party is BYOB but we will 
expect our
guests to act responsibility.  (We do NOT want to hose off the 
porch after
this one!) 

Jenifer Foulmood
mskw1
                    Work like you don't need the money.
                     Love like you've never been hurt.
                       Dance like nobody's watching.
		        Sing like you want to live.

--0-1607740291-1046152942=:96510
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


10.  No hot chicks at parties to distract from the music

 9.  Hardman music does the sound so all you hear is the amp popping 
b/c it is struggling to push sound out of 25 speakers (notice the word 
amp as in singular)

 8.  Plenty of half-ass productions companies that claim that they are 
 going to revive the scene (let it be known that there are only 
a few good production companies in ohio now)

 7.  Gotta love all the shady people

 6.  Everyone and their mom plays hard house

 5.  Plenty of djs that have perfected the sacred and powerful 
trainwreck mixing style

 4.  All the tweakers that love happy hardcore

 3.  No one goes out to support the great local talent


 2.  Abundant parking b/c of #3

 1.  No other scene has great people like Mr. S. T.  and Tom Cox to make 
fun of.

ROFLMAO.

Except I would say one love threw part of that out the window this weekend.

I saw plenty of hot chicks.

8th day did sound in at least three rooms and it was top notch - i notice
there was shitty sound in the back room but i don't know where that came
from.

>  8.  Plenty of half-ass productions companies that claim that they are

I haven't seen much of that in the last year.


>  7.  Gotta love all the shady people

Most of the shady people didn't make it out to one love... I wonder where
they were?


>  6.  Everyone and their mom plays hard house

Only a handful anymore, they rest have either evolved into breaks, prog, or
techno or they use hard house to peak a set (as it was intended to do in the
first place).


>  4.  All the tweakers that love happy hardcore

Wrong, most of the tweakers here like hard house or broken muffler jungle.


>  3.  No one goes out to support the great local talent

indeed.

"People selling drug paraphernalia are in essence no different than drug
dealers," said John Brown, acting DEA chief. "They are as much a part of
drug trafficking as silencers are a part of criminal homicide."

Subject: {pb-cle} Saying hi to all of ya'll down here in kentuck-ee

Hey my name is steve wiggins and I just decided to join this mailing list.  
Just thought I would say hi and meet some new folks.  I live in lexington, 
kentucky.  Why join a board outside of your region there, mr. wiggins you 
ask?  Well, I know a few nice people in pittsburgh (shout out to trish! You 
my gurl! *flashes eash coast sign*)(shout out to maria b. what up?)  And was 
like hey, might as well join.  So yay!

I am trying desperately to go to the dieselboy/bad company show but I don't 
have a ride, because people in lexington are no fun.  A-sides is playing in 
cincy tonight for 2 bucks.  www.zeropointrecords.com check that out.

:-)

Steve

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 10 reasons why i love the pb-cle scene



Yeah it is kind of tough being at parties with so many attractive ladies.  
You tend to forget who is playing in what room and what music is and stuff.

*shoves up glasses*  *snorts*  Can I have your email address?

Not that i have asked for an email address from a female party-goer before, 
heavens no!

--0-1839361283-1046186342=:67481
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


With all of the wonderful people that I met on Saturday, I'm surprised that there haven't been more reviews..........................................................but here's mine.

      I was really pumped for One Love since it was at the Eagles Nest again and the last time I was there was a blast.  Yet, the night was not without its "bumps in the road".  Nic and I are on our way to the Eagle, and we are on the tnpke. when we start to realize that it seems to be taking a little bit longer than usual.  Finally we decide to pull off and ask a toll booth operator if we were going in the right direction.  We come to find out that 80 has changed all of its numbers on the exits.  So while we were looking for exit 8 we really should've been looking for exit 145 and they made an extra dollar off of us, "c'est la vie".  On the way back we saw all of these salt trucks where Nic stated, "they must know something that we don't."  Little did he know that, that was all too true.  

         Once we make it there the fun begins with the added bonus of the parking lot becoming an ice rink!  If it wasn't so cold I think I could've enjoyed falling on my ass a few more times.  The night started out a little slow, most people didn't make it there until after midnight.  The first set we heard was factor e (?) which was pretty good until this god-awful trainwreck, he didn't really recover after that.  Voight-kampff once again was a great addition to the night, but unfortuantly I lost track of time and missed a good portion of their set.  Odi was nice to see, and although he did have his trainwrecks towards the end he at least was poised enough to stop and try again.  I can respect that.  I think my favorite set of the night was Charles Feelgood, he had some really nice tracks.  I heard that he was upset that he didn't get to play in the main room, which I can understand, but I can't complain too much since I had lots of room to dance downstairs :o)  Also, an honorable mention of the night, Nautigroove, just because he is the first person I have ever heard to lay down Born Sippy at a party.  What a magical moment!

     The highlight of the night, which has been a pleasant surprise lately, was all of the great people I met.  The usuals (Trout, Tricia, and Todd.....hmmm.... triple t's), but also some new faces, Meghan, Luke, Ray G, and Brian (silverraver).  For the record, and I have already mentioned this to a few, it has been so refreshing to finally meet some people from the list and realize that (so far) you have been the nicest people I have ever met through the scene.  Most people on this list come off as complete ego-driven assholes, and it's good to know that for most of you it's just your alter ego :o)

     So after a wonderful evening/morning it's off into the tundra where we have heard throughout the night that all of the interstates are closed.  Who ever has pictures of the weather (Brian) should really post it just so everyone realizes that Hell really did freeze over during One Love.  Total props to the people throwing this event and the owners of the Eagles Nest for not kicking everyone to the curb, and if I'm not mistaken, letting the party go on a little longer in hopes that people could wait out the storm.  I hope that everyone got home ok with no complications.  The weather was by far the worst I have ever seen at an event, but I think most would be willing to brave it again for a party like this.  What a great night..

Marisa

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fwd: RG: FC: Feds raid drug paraphernalia sites, to be redirected
 to DEA.gov (fwd)

I've been to all kinds of sites from people sending me links, or me finding 
them various places. Plenty of times I don't even know where I am heading. 
Many times I have ended up getting redirected somewhere I didn't expect to 
be. I am sure my mom has clicked on some pigfucker link at some point 
because she isn't that savvy on the net. This is scary stuff.

I remember a comment that a friend made to me on September 11th. We were all 
sent home and were watching the news coverage. He pointed to the smoke 
rising from one of the towers and said: "That's our digital freedom going up 
in smoke right there." I didn't realize how true it was just then.

Next thing you know visitors to www.bonsaikitten.com will be under 
investigation.

With all of the wonderful people that I met on Saturday, I'm surprised that there haven't been more reviews..........................................................but here's mine.

I was really pumped for One Love since it was at the Eagles Nest again and the last time I was there was a blast. Yet, the night was not without its "bumps in the road". Nic and I are on our way to the Eagle, and we are on the tnpke. when we start to realize that it seems to be taking a little bit longer than usual. Finally we decide to pull off and ask a toll booth operator if we were going in the right direction. We come to find out that 80 has changed all of its numbers on the exits. So while we were looking for exit 8 we really should've been looking for exit 145 and they made an extra dollar off of us, "c'est la vie". On the way back we saw all of these salt trucks where Nic stated, "they must know something that we don't." Little did he know that, that was all too true. 

Once we make it there the fun begins with the added bonus of the parking lot becoming an ice rink! If it wasn't so cold I think I could've enjoyed falling on my ass a few more times. The night started out a little slow, most people didn't make it there until after midnight. The first set we heard was factor e (?) which was pretty good until this god-awful trainwreck, he didn't really recover after that. Voight-kampff once again was a great addition to the night, but unfortuantly I lost track of time and missed a good portion of their set. Odi was nice to see, and although he did have his trainwrecks towards the end he at least was poised enough to stop and try again. I can respect that. I think my favorite set of the night was Charles Feelgood, he had some really nice tracks. I heard that he was upset that he didn't get to play in the main room, which I can understand, but I can't complain too much since I had lots of room to dance downstairs :o) Also, an honorable mention of the night, Nautigroove, just because he is the first person I have ever heard to lay down Born Sippy at a party. What a magical moment!

The highlight of the night, which has been a pleasant surprise lately, was all of the great people I met. The usuals (Trout, Tricia, and Todd.....hmmm.... triple t's), but also some new faces, Meghan, Luke, Ray G, and Brian (silverraver). For the record, and I have already mentioned this to a few, it has been so refreshing to finally meet some people from the list and realize that (so far) you have been the nicest people I have ever met through the scene. Most people on this list come off as complete ego-driven assholes, and it's good to know that for most of you it's just your alter ego :o)

So after a wonderful evening/morning it's off into the tundra where we have heard throughout the night that all of the interstates are closed. Who ever has pictures of the weather (Brian) should really post it just so everyone realizes that Hell really did freeze over during One Love. Total props to the people throwing this event and the owners of the Eagles Nest for not kicking everyone to the curb, and if I'm not mistaken, letting the party go on a little longer in hopes that people could wait out the storm. I hope that everyone got home ok with no complications. The weather was by far the worst I have ever seen at an event, but I think most would be willing to brave it again for a party like this. What a great night..

Marisa

sounds like nautigroove just was the first person to have the balls to face
the haters when it comes to dropping born sLippy... I still want to drop

I've heard Born Slippy at several parties, although they were all in
the '97-'99 timeframe. It's a good track.

Doggone I wish I had gone.  But I was poor and didn't have any money at all. 
  Maybe I will make it out to an event but until I get some more money that

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 10 reasons why i love the pb-cle scene

I'll second that there were plentiful ammount of hotness at this one. 
 Except they freaking move too much.  As soon as I realize I should 
take a picture they walk away :-/  This one chick had really wild 
hair and when she was in the rooms with the blacklights, her hair 
glowed :)  everytime I tried to get a picture she would leave though 
:)

That girl's hair was a trip!  I couldn't decide if it was her real hair in dreads or if it was yarn.  Kind of moving towards the latter since I have never seen the color and texture in human hair before, but who knows.  It was a definite eye-catcher in that back room with the black lights.  Oh, and I can third the motion that there is some nice eye candy running around, but my god, they all look like they're 13!  Maybe I'm just getting old.....

I guess my other message didn't get through because of references to 
a certain person (damn you traaaat) :)

Anywho, submitted for your approval, top secret intelligence.  This 
was taken by placing a mini camera right on the badger (note the 
point of view).  I cannot vouch for the authenticity of this, just 
that it was obtained for certain sites which cannot be mention on a 
public forum.  unfortunately this doesn't show the actual milking 
process, but you can see the end product stored on the lower shelf.

unfortunately, we could not gain any intelligence on the actual 
process.  It doesn't appear to be next to a fridge, and it doesn't 
have a dozen badgers in there.  Our only guess is this is a secondary 
storage area and the actual process is conducted elsewhere.

btw, I second the "huh huh he huh huh you said teets" remark :)

FRIDAY 2/28/03 NIGEL RICHARDS-PHILADELPHIA
1120-Cincinnati presents:
NIGEL RICHARDS-PHILADELPHIA
live from the exquisite 1120-Cincinnati facility. This massive crowd pleaser never fails to deliver a proper blend of house, techno and breaks with his distinctive acidic flavor. Besides running things with his 611 Records store and label, he is an established producer with over 30 releases to his credit. Once again 1120 presents a prime opportunity to see premier league top shelf talent here in Cincinnati and we promise this kingpin of the US scene will get your booty rocking. (see his full bio @ the end of this post).

NIGEL RICHARDS BIO (from buzzlife)
Nigel Richards is one of the most prominent figures in dance music today. Globally recognized as a DJ, producer and entrepreneur behind the seminal Philadelphia based 611Records label and store, his influence can be felt long after the turntables stop spinning.
Touring 52 weeks a year for the past 14 years, Richards is considered to be one of the worlds most in-demand DJs. Club and partygoers throughout North America, and as far away as London, Scotland, Germany and Austria have enjoyed his unique style of party rocking. Highly respected in techno for his intensely textual style, Richards has received extensive critical acclaim. He has been named one of the most successful artists in the industry, and one of the hardest working.
Says DJ Dan in URB Magazines September 2000 issue: "He truly has a good time with what he does. He's a very successful entrepreneur: He has a clothing line, a record store, he's a DJ, he's a producer, and he does all of them very well. He does everything to the best of his ability, and that's very inspiring."

SATURDAY 3/8/03 SIMPLY JEFF-LOS ANGELES
1120-Cincinnati presents:
SIMPLY JEFF-LOS ANGELES (MOONSHINE MUSIC/PHONOMENTAL)

live and direct from 1120. If you are into the funky breakbeat sound this left-coast pioneer is NOT one to miss. This well-travelled veteran of the US rave and club scene has graduated to become one of the top draws in the country and has seen his latest mix cds released by heavyweight Moonshine Music. If you buy breaks tracks dont miss his new/recent label PHONOMENTAL which features Jeff and his like minded contemporaries banging the funk on wax. (see his full bio @ the end of this post).

SIMPLY JEFF BIO
Southern California's original breakbeat mogul, Simply Jeff, known globally as a DJ and producer who displays an eclectic blend of breaks which incorporate House, Techno, Trance and Drum n' Bass into a well rounded breakbeat sound. Recognized as a pioneer of the "Funky Breaks / West Coast Breakbeat House" sound in Simon Reynold's novel "Generation Ecstasy," as well as a resident Breakbeat writer for Los Angeles based BPM magazine, running his own Phonomental Music record label and performing in clubs to major events every weekend, Simply Jeff is no doubt become one of America's most beloved breakbeat heroes.
Simply Jeff will continue to push the sound he loves the most. While working and crossing the line with many different artist such as the godfather of Hip Hop Afrika Bambaataa, 80's pop star Stacy Q, Andrew Dice Clay to Snoop Doggy Dog, coupled with his developing side projects - Divine Frequency, S.J.P. and The Phonoheadz - Simply Jeff will constantly be challenging the limitless boundaries of electronic music.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} One Love Pictures

no pictures of me this time!..  yessssssssh


the event was ok i guess. I was really tired considering i spent my whole
entire weekend in pittsburgh and drove back in shitty weather and went
straight the the Nest to get rid of some flyers I had.

Raps set wasnt amazing at all. Not that i thought it was going to be, but I
have to say that Odi most definatly had the tunes that night. He played some
jams I never thought he would get down to...
As far as the live pa, those kids rock out every damn time...

I think most of the people running around were from the southern part of
Ohio. Basically I met more of them, than i did Cleveland at all. Thats kinda
odd. Didnt bother me tho, it was just something I noticed.

Trout seems to find it amazing that I wasnt drunk that night, but i drank
myself silly when i was in pittsburgh chillin with 412dnb..  those kids
drain me sometimes.. :P    I had to chill out.

the netmeet...  what happend? Trouty pointed me out to it, but i think i all
ready met most of the people that were there....  :)     even tho the
weather was maad crappy, i had fun for the time i was there...

Im sorry I missed your set Doug, I was so hella tired walking around there
that I left around 3am, or so. I could have swore you said you got an
earlier time slot..

muahz,
jes

beautiful displays.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


This is directed mostly towards people in or around the Stark County area but all are welcome.  Below is an email from the head of the Stark County Peace Coalition.  Thought I would help spread the word about the upcoming rallies and overall effort.
Hello everyone,   OK, so I promised you an update last night.  Things got busy, but here you go! 3 items of importance!!!!!! 1) Our next march is in 5 days!  We meet at the NORTH BRANCH of the Stark County District Library at 1 PM on Saturday (March 1st).  The North Branch is at 189 25th St NW, just off of Market Avenue.  There will be NO speeches this time, just a brief address, and a march.  BRING SIGNS!  We will march up 25th Street to Cleveland Avenue, and fan out along the 4 corners of 25th/Cleveland.  The march is only 7/10ths of a mile, and we will be happy to provide a ride back to the library if you should need it. We have secured a small parking lot very close to 25th/Cleveland (about 100 feet away).  I do not see any reason why we would need to rally in that lot, but it's there for us if necessary. 2) We have a webpage now!  http://www.starkcountypeacecoalition.org/ is the address.  It's just been created about 12 hours ago, and it will hold all the details of upcoming events.  There is a collection of pictures from last week's rally at www.radiofreecanton.net and hopefully those will get transferred over to our new home!  Thanks to Radio Free Canton 90.5 fm for the new web space! 3) I've created a new e-mail address specifically for our little gang.  Please note that I'm at StarkCountyPeace@neo.rr.com but you can still reach me easily at the old address.   OTHER ACTIVITIES!!!!!! - This Wednesday, there is a "virtual march" taking place.  MoveOn.org is attempting to rally supporters to call Congress.  Each congressperson, each Senator, and the White House will all receive a phone call AND a fax every minute to show them exactly how much we stand against the war in Iraq.  Information is at http://www.moveon.org/winwithoutwar/ so go check it out and sign up! - If this war does happen, on the day of the start of the war, we will meet at 9pm in the center of Canton (the place where we stopped mid-march last week).  Bring your signs and candles.  A candlelight vigil will be held, so we can show our opposition to the war and we can begin to mourn what will certainly be the deaths of innocent lives everywhere. Now, for the agenda of our meeting on Saturday. We decided to change our name.  Our membership exists outside of Canton, and we are currently basing our protests against the war in Iraq, and not necessarily all wars.  After a discussion, we decided that we shall now be known as the Stark County Peace Coalition. We agreed that we will hold demonstrations EVERY Saturday.  We'll let you know of the location as quickly as we can, but count on Saturday rallies to happen as long as we can maintain them.  The tone of our last rally took an anti-Republican turn when I grabbed the bullhorn.  I'll never apologize for my own personal politics, but I must apologize to the entire group for forcing my politics on all of you.  We all are in this to promote peace, and I will remember that next time.  Along those lines, we decided to make sure that everyone in the community knows that our doors are WIDE open to anybody and everybody who wants peace and are willing to stand up for it. At the Saturday meeting, we were represented by members of the Green, Democratic, Republican and Libertarian parties.  It is a rare opportunity when you can draw support from these ends of the spectrum, and we therefore MUST be inclusive to all persuasions.  As the founder of this group, it is my responsibility to lead the rallies in that direction, and I promise to you all that I will do so. We are in the process of creating a mission statement.  This will be the basis for our operation, and a handy tool to refer to when people want to know more about us.  We will reveal our mission statement soon (probably in the first e-mail after Saturday's rally).  In the meantime, if anybody has ANYTHING they'd like to add to our mission statement, please let us know now.  we'll discuss and debate all ideas that we see.  You are all a part of this process, so please let your voices be heard. This week, we are reaching out to other local peace groups.  Since we're new at this, we need the guidance and wisdom of experienced peace activists.  If you have any contacts with nearby groups, let us know! That pretty much sums up our meeting...after Saturday's march, we will hold another meeting.  You are invited to attend that meeting (basement of North Branch Library). All our meetings are open to the group, if space permits.  Peace and love to all of you tonight,Jeff Seemann

I dont remember how it went.Fuck! I do know someone played it at 
Electronic Sensation, maybe AK?, but not really being a junglist, i 
have no clue. Im sure its a really big tune and if anynoe thinks they

I heard alot of songs with words in it :)  And if I remember right, it's
the way was one of the last songs he played :)  There has to be some words
that you remembered.

eh... am I the only one that actually got this in their inbox? If there are as many ears virgin to such innovative sounds within the 'underground dance scene' as this lack of response indicates, then this show should provide to many the experience simular to walking into your first 'rave' and 'falling in love' with amazing music unlike anything you've heard, even from going to 'raves' for x amount of years... this is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to support Legowelt's last appearance in town; we're truly privileged to be offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties': they are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience (and hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of ya)!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Cleveland Electronic Music Festival?

no Doug is correct, there were close to 400 people... not at one given time,
as dj's came and left so did the people that came to support them. Our bars
reflected sales appropriate for a crowd of this size.
  As far as industry reps, your guess is as good as mine. Peabody's arranged
everything and basicly rented our facility and we had nothing to do with the
dj's nor the agents. Hopefully there was and took note of some of the better
DJ's that played! Cleveland has some good talent and some bad.I have started
an open table night in our second room on Sundays to help support the local
scene. We also rotate new faces onto the main stage all the time and by
playing in the back we will get a chance to select some of the hot new
talent as we see it.

Jim
Metropolis Nightclub

ps: comments are welcome and appreciated concerning my club.
  If you have not been to Metropolis in a while ,come check it out [it has
definately changed], you can go to our website and obtain a free admission
pass for normal events [sunday night] http://www.metropolis-cleveland.com .
I know that alot of you hate the place due to reasons in the past (mostly
those bald headed bouncers that went WAY overboard when we first took over).
They have been long time eliminated. The water in the bathroom works
now,unlike before. The roof does not leak. The place is clean, your feet
don't stick to the floor anymore. Admission prices have been deflated, Joe
the previous owner was running it into the ground and whoring all the money
that you all paid. We had alot of mountains to takle when we purchased the
club. For reasons I cannot mention [legal], certain staff members had to
stay for the times they did. Unfortionately some people lost the jobs they
held there by decisions made by these people who we were stuck with
including some of the bar tenders and dj's. This hurt our buisness but we
were stuck due to undisclosed information when we purchased the club. Thanks
for listening.

Chris you also need to realise that 300-400 people in our club looks empty
when you have the main,backstage, and vip open. We legally can hold 1500 and
have had well over 2000 back in the day and I think we even had 2300+ when
the singer "Blondie" performed there!

Man I wish I lived in a town that was hip to music like this.  I would give 
my first born child to see legowelt live.  Have fun and post an event review 
when you go to the show.

Um yeah that tune was on dub for a full year before it was released so I 
have heard it 127319832718 times.  I think odi played it last july after it 
was released.

Odi is a decent dj, wish he wouldn't play tunes that have been caned to 
death already.

At an event in lexington last year called century 3 he played john b's up 
all night and that tune was caned to death as well.

Yikes.

if drum and bass tunes were really all that good, they wouldnt get
"played out", they would become all time classic anthems like good
songs in other genres do.

DID SOMEONE SAY SUV?
Gawww.... I haven't been out to see quality talent in a minute.  Man it 
sucks living in lexington and not having a car to go see shows.
It also sucks living in lexington because we don't get any good music coming 
our way only once in a blue moon.

needs to move,

Yes you are correct my friend.  The reason tunes get played out is becuase 
in the d and b scene they get released on dubs AGES before they are ever 
supposed to be released just so djs who are producers can test them on the 
crowd they play for that night.  I dont' know if this is true for other 
genres but to me it seems that d and b djs play out a lot more often and 
people in the scene have a crack like addicition to new tunes hot off the 
press.  *raises hand*  I do too.  I guess that is why tunes get played out 
before they are released to the public.  That trend is slowly, slowly, dying 
tho and I have noticed that in the last couple of months more tunes are 
coming out that haven't been caned to death and are quality.  But I haven't 
been to a rave, or whatever you want to call it in a while, so I don't know 
what is hip in the scene anymore as far as dj tracklists are concerned.

in my head lexington is a land of soft hills and an abundence of horses all
saddled and ready to go for me to ride, like you are walking in the mall and
look, there's a horse, lets ride it!
and every nite there is a sonic terror event.
and marriott gives me fantastic benies and i live in a large southern
mansion :)

it better be all that and more = ]

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} One Love Pictures

it used to be that producers cut dubs to test out their mixdowns on club 
systems...but now the big boys are so advanced with their production skills 
and the big cutting houses in the uk just have have mastering down to a 
science...that they dont really need the dubs to test the final mixdown and 
mastering anymore...nowadays most dubplates are just status symbols...they 
prove you are down with certain crews...its like the bling bling of the dnb 
world...gold chain, nice sneakers, and a box of dubs...

Thanks for the extremely entusiastic words Anthony.  Good to see some people are as excited about this as we are.  And if thats not enough European electro for you....

Invading Cleveland : FRIDAY MARCH 28th 2003
http://www.experimedia.net/invasion/ClevelandInvasionFrontWeb.jpg 
Chances are they will be at Pats In The Flats but we are currently looking into some alternatives this week. 
:LIVE:
Le Syndicat Electronique
It & My Computer
Porn.Darsteller
Ottomas Adventure
Raison FUture
:DJ:
A// 
If anyone can help with a venue alternative that already has sound it it would be greatly appreciated.  Since I will be on the road with IP for the week and several of the Headroom members will be in Amsterdam performing at the Earrational Festival I am seeking a less complicated alternative.  I am shooting for somewhere like Symposium/Chamber/Phantasy.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: {pb-cle} one love pix

okay, so i've been a lazy drunken ass this week and didn't post the pix 
right off, but here they are

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/one_love

it really was a good party.  the weather totally sucked, but we got out 
before that.

some really good music and a good crowd.  lots of ppl out, and a few ppl 
i didn't expect to see!
maggie, havent seen her in forever and there she was!  craziness.

havent stuck it out to the end of a party in forever, and had a good 
time till the end.  we were all bullshitting about bullshit well after 
the party ended.  craziness.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Fri Feb 28                  INCLINATION PART DEUX                  Columbus

February 28, 2003 :: Scarlet and Grey Cafe :: Columbus
Cooked Goose Productions presents:

Inclination Part Deux

Back in September we started a Friday night to celebrate the broken beat.  
This Edition of Inclination is featuring the finer sides of House and 
Techno.

Jason "Lemon" Lyman-(Godown, Brique Rouge Traxx, PCP)
10 years of experience under his belt and a wicked selection of House 
music destined to make you dance.  Jason is returning for his second 
Inclination appearance

Mike Salamon - (DMBL) Columbus 
Fresh back from a fall trip to Europe, Mike filled up his record bag with 
some great techno that you just don't find here in the states all that 
often.  He'll definately be dropping a pleasurable flavor of intelligent 
music stylings.

Goose - (Cooked Goose, DMBL) Columbus
I whore myself out to diversity, but I always carry really cheesy music in 
my bag if I'm feeling playful.  It's pretty much up in the air what style 
I'll choose to drop to open the night up, but it will probably be either 
breakbeat or house based stylings, but I've had an itch to drop a 
downtempo hip hop set of old school... who knows?

Scarlet and Grey Cafe
2203 N High Street (corner of Norwich and High)
$3 for 21+, $5 for 18-20 (bar adds 2 dollars for each underage head)

Groove Reactor Records and Buckwyld Entertainment Presents:

BACK TO THE BASICS 3
March 1st, 2003
Southwest, Ohio

It's been over 4.5 years now, and we're still going strong. We've thrown 
massives, club events, intimate events, and we keep coming back for more! 
On this night, we will revive the series that started it all - BACK TO THE 
BASICS! This event is exactly that - a return to the old school. We've 
secured an intimate 1 room venue, an awesome sound system, a killer lineup 
and the kind of old school atmosphere and decorations that got a lot of us 
into the scene long ago. We will be giving away hundreds of copies of 
D8A's newest CD, and we will be powering our evening's visuals with 
another laser to blow you away.

SATURDAY MARCH 1st, 2003:

ROMANOWSKI
(Future Primitive Sound, The Curators, San Francisco)

www.futureprimitivesound.com
www.thecurators.com
www.romanowski45.com

Dj Romanowski is a riddle wrapped inside an enigma, dressed up in 
thrift-shop finery. While many DJ's play vintage music, Romanowski's whole 
life is an expression of vintage values. Though born in Switzerland, 
Roman's world springs from the Haight & Ashbury district of San Francisco. 
His image is very much a man living in the present, he just seems to have 
saved the best he could find from the past. You can hear it in the music 
he produces for Future Primitive Sound. It sounds like it's made of old 
samples but the way the brakes are organized, the incredible scratching, 
and the off wall composition is cutting edge. His music is designed for 
the funk and hip-hop fan, or better yet, for the person who digs dance 
music but may not like the fact that much of it sounds like shit.

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Carpe Noctem - Seize the Night
March 8th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring

Dj Dara - NYC, NY - DnB - BreakBeatScience, PlanetOfTheDrums, Am Only

As a result from both his successful DJing and recording endeavors, Dara 
has become one of the most recognizable faces on the US drum 'n' bass 
scene. He has been featured in countless magazine appearances and 
interviews both in the US and worldwide. He can be found making his annual 
appearance at the legendary Notting Hill Carnival along with raves and 
clubs all across the US. For some time Dara was also the host of a weekly 
web-TV show Velocity on which he has interviewed some of the leading names 
in drum 'n' bass, including Jonny L, Kemistry and Storm, Trace, Ed Rush 
and Optical, Hype, Andy C, Zinc, SS and many others.

Dara is currently working on single releases for his own imprint, 
Breakbeat Science Recordings, including the upcoming BBSCI003 release 
"Possession / Duplicity (Klute Rmx)" which is being caned on plate at the 
moment. In 2000, Dara completed "From Here To There", a new mixed CD on 
Moonshine that features some amazing tracks. These include Dara's own 
"Duplicity" (Klute Remix), as well as set opener "Crazy" by L Double & 
Serena, DJ Hype's "The Big 3-Oh," two tracks from John B ("Prowler" and 
"Progress"), Kenny Ken's "Project One" and numerous other top tracks.

Along with touring nation wide, Dara has been recording some original 
tracks and putting them out on his Breakbeat Science and Orgone Recordings 
imprints. Breakbeat Science is not only his label, but it is also the 
first and biggest drum 'n' bass store, co-founded by Dara. Dara has done 
an array of remixes including on singles from DJ's such as Keoki, 
Pizzicato Five, Dog Eat Dog, Black Nostaljack and Afrika Bambaata.

With the recent eruption of Drum and Bass in the U.S., DJ Dara isn't going 
anywhere. There is no telling what kind of damage his next endeavors might 
do.


Dj Abstract - San Francisco, CA - DnB - Phunckateck Communications, Pneuma 
Recordings, Just 2 Management, www.justtwo.com, www.djabstract.com

Abstract is widely considered to be one of the most influential players in 
the United States drum and bass scene - from throwing the seminal Bay Area 
weekly "Energi" to Djing with Phunckateck Communications to starting his 
label Pneuma Recordings, Alex has dedicated all his spare energy and time 
into helping to forge what is now one of the nation's strongest scenes in 
San Francisco. Over the eight years that he's been djing, Alex has become 
famous for his seamless mixing, impeccable track selection, and his 
ability to move any crowd (an ability that has brought him requests from 
all over the United States and as far away as Ireland, Denmark, Costa 
Rica, Puerto Rico, and Russia), but these days he's also known as one of 
the US's most well-respected producers. He has an impressive discography 
including releases on Rawkus, Moonshine, Sunburn, Green, F-111, Subtitles, 
OM, Phuturo, Breakbeat Science, Pneuma, and more, including upcoming 
releases on Formation, among others. His tracks have been played by 
leading Djs such as Rap, Dom and Roland, SS, K/Polar, Klute, and Goldie, 
and he has collaborated with noted artists such as TeeBee, Calibre, and 
UFO!. Due to his talent as both producer and Dj, Abstract has been 
featured in URB's "Top 100", the German magazine DeBug, the US' premier 
D&B magazine, Tha Pride, Muzik magazine (record of the month), and XLR8R 
magazine, as well as a slew of website/online and offline radio features - 
not to mention Phunckateck interviews too numerous to list. Pneuma has 
grown into one of the most respected American Drum and Bass labels around, 
one of the few non-british labels to have a british distribution deal , 
and continues to release quality material from the Phunckateck camp. In 
addition to his well-established career as one of the top names in the US 
Drum and Bass scene, Abstract has been making noise in the 2step,

High Contrast ( Hospital Records, Breakbeat Science) London UK

High Contrast is young Cardiff-based dj/producer Lincoln Barret, one of 
the leading artists in the soulful drum+bass scene. His music fuses many 
styles, from deep jazz to soundtracks, garage to disco. High Contrast 
reputation has ceaslessly gone from strength to strength, making colossal 
waves in the drum+bass scene. Most memorable are his latest releases "Make 
It Tonight", which received a caning from virtually every high profile dj 
in the drum+bass fraternity, and his superb reworkings of Hatiras' "Spaced 
Invader" and London Elektricity vs Robert Owens' "My Dreams". Lincoln is 
currently remixing a track for DJ Marky's next EP on V Recordings, and has 
been nominated for 3 gongs (Best Producer, Best Drum+Bass DJ and Best 
remix) at The Welsh Music Awards. Not many drum and bass artists can claim 
so much airplay on Radio One: not one Fabio+Grooverider radio show has 
gone by in the past few months without a High Contrast tune!

Sat Mar 29                ANALOGUE HEAVEN MIDWEST V              NE Indiana

[not music, but gear related]

Analogue Heaven MidWest 2003

"The Voyager Home"
Official Information

The FIFTH annual AHMW get-together will be Saturday, March 29th at the 
PHHS Auditorium. I'll be there by 9:00 am. Who knows what time (or day) it 
will be when we're done :) All synthgeekgearheads are encouraged to join 
us and spend some time with awesome gear and great people.

AHMW 2003 is held in NE Indiana, midway between three empires of synth 
music: Detroit, Chicago, and... uh... Dayton!

MAP #1 shows the location relative to Interstate 69 and the Indiana Toll 
Road.
MAP #2 shows the close-up view of where to park for easy gear unloading.

Please bring a $5 - $10 "Free will" donation to help pay for auditorium 
rental

The exact address is 245 S 1150 E, Lagrange, IN 46795
If you need help getting here, just email me.
drew@ph.k12.in.us

What to bring:
* Your cool synths
* Long extension cords and power strips
* Audio cables, small mixer and headphones
* Camera!

With so many synths begging to be played, headphones are ideal for 
exploring all the different instruments people bring.
I have a PA for the performances. Anyone wishing to bring additional PA 
equipment will be welcomed to do so :)

Performances:
Live performances of all kinds are encouraged. There are plans underway to 
record them and burn AHMW2003 CD's.
We should probably try to sync up a jam session as well :)

Food:
We will collect orders and $ for lunch and dinner. Lunch will be 
sandwiches from the Lagrange Subway, and dinner will be Papa John's pizza. 
Feel free to bring your own if you wish. There are a couple nearby 
restaurants and gas stations, but not much. Angola and Lagrange have 
McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. PHHS is a rural school.

Also, since this is a school building, consumption of alcohol on the 
grounds is illegal, and smoking is not permitted inside.


A few of the local motels would be:

Ramada Inn (R on map #1) North of Angola at I69 exit 154
$89 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9471
has restaurant, bar, indoor pool and sauna

Best Western (W on map #1) At Highway 20 and I69 exit 148
$65 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9165

Holiday Inn (H on map #1) At Indiana Toll Road, Howe exit
$79 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-562-3660

I can't tell you much about these, having never stayed at any of them. 
Several people stayed at the Best Western last year...

Today is the first day of the rest of your life.   it's also the posting of 
this months Month End Set:
Cut N' Paste

This group is otherwise known as Plump DJs.   These two are fantastic 
producers and, believe it or not, they can spin too!   What rare skills.   
The Essential Mix was made mad live on 11-05-2000.   This set it total 
sickness.   It's all break beat that some of you out there might be jealous 
of, myself included.   The set is just shy of 2 hours.   PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT.  
 

The Month End Set (now referred to as the M.E.S. for shits and giggles) is to 
use up bandwidth that I have already paid for and don't want to go to waste.  
 

The set can be found at and has a limit on the number of people that can 
download it.   Do it now, because it goes offline in a few days or when the 
max download limit has been reached.

February 28, 2003 :: Scarlet and Grey Cafe :: Columbus
Cooked Goose Productions presents:

Inclination Part Deux

Back in September we started a Friday night to celebrate the broken =
beat.  This Edition of Inclination is featuring the finer sides of House =
and Techno, mainly featuring Jason and Mike tag teaming throughout the =
night with another special guest, jonathan kennedy aka black valentine.

Jason "Lemon" Lyman-(Godown, Brique Rouge Traxx, PCP)
10 years of experience under his belt and a wicked selection of House =
music destined to make you dance.  Jason is returning for his second =
Inclination appearance

Mike Salamon - (On the Floor, Polyphonic, DMBL) Columbus=20
Fresh back from a fall trip to Europe, Mike filled up his record bag =
with some great techno that you just don't find here in the states all =
that often.  He'll definately be dropping a pleasurable flavor of =
intelligent music stylings.

Goose - (Cooked Goose, DMBL) Columbus
I whore myself out to diversity, but I always carry really cheesy music =
in my bag if I'm feeling playful.  It's pretty much up in the air what =
style I'll choose to drop when i show up after a fun 13 hours of work =
prior to arriving, but it will probably be either breakbeat or house =
based stylings, but I've had an itch to drop a downtempo hip hop set of =
old school... who knows?

Scarlet and Grey Cafe
2203 N High Street (corner of Norwich and High)
$3 for 21+, $5 for 18-20 (bar adds 2 dollars for each underage head)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} badhuman tour- c-bus


I am going to be there!

I haven't gotten to go clubbing enough in the past.. but I've been hitting 
up the factory a bunch lately.  I like those new EAW mains... tasty.

ALthough I went to see telepopmusik last night and it was... not too good.  
I might actually post a review later.... I didn't expect much, but it was 
less than expected.

Anyway, I haven't been posting on the list much, so those of you that know 
me- How y'all doing?

-Dave

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RIP Mr Rogers

Not only was his show a seminal influence in the development of many children over the last 30 plus
years, but he was also a revered figure in the Pittsburgh area. I met him when I was probably 8 or 9
years old, and I've talked to many people who interacted with him as adults, and all of us note that
there
was no difference between his on camera and off camera persona. He was truly a genuine, caring,
loving individual, and his peaceful influence will be sorely missed in this world.

your neighbor,
m

I was depressed in finding this out, after having lived the majority of my
life being called Mr. Rodgers as a spoof, but still respecting his morality
he taught on his TV series. (It's only fitting that my second job is working
for Highlights for Children magazine)  I had even put this tragedy on my
'morning update' which a few of you receive that i had lost my 'father'...
but this post is mainly about my morning update... i send out news clips
from what's hot to read in the morning (what else can i do at 7:30 in the
morning when there aint shit to do) as well as links to funny sites, comics
in-line, etc... i've even thought about designing a website for it, but this
is my invitation to those that are interested in getting the day's news with
some side commentary from yours truly, just write me back privately and i'll
add you to the distribution list...

didn't really care for him all that much, but I liked when they went

btw, you can put me on that list if you want, hopefully the spam

Yeah, my absolute favorite was the crayon factory.  A close second would be when they showed how to make saxophones.  I was never really fond of "the land of make-belive", but it all had its wholesome charm.  The show definitely had its influence on me and my childhood, and he will be missed.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle}NRR  RIP Mr Rogers

yeah, that's actually been around for a while. i got those on mp3 in the early days of napster...

i believe that nothing is above parody or humor, even death, given that it's done in a respectful
manner. if they'd pulled that out today, i'd say it was in a bit of bad taste.

but overall, i think most people who know who he is, even if they think it's hokey, would agree that
he was very good for children's development.

i challenge anyone anywhere to find something on tv today in any genre that even COMPARES to what he
did...

part of the reason he is tolerable (and i hate ALL childrens
television, my son isnt allowed to watch any, though i guess he
can check some mr rogers reruns) is that there was never a super
huge corporate push to sell mr rogers mehandise like there is for
EVERY single other children's product. granted, the guy had some
records and whatnot, but its not like blues clues or barney or
even sesame street. it was pretty hard to sell mr rogers, which is
pretty much a good thing.

Subject: {pb-cle} Track ID?

Does anyone have any info about that "69 percent" track? Its house. They say 
69% throughout almost the whole thing, so you'll recognize it if you've 
heard it. I assume thats the name too, but you get a lot of statistics when 
searching for that on the net.

Does it have something to do with music production? It leads me to believe 
that its a little more relevant than just being some juvenile reference to 
mutual oral sex.

You are trashing HH and NRG with a sig that referances HappyHardcore..... 
Now that is not only ironic but amusing.

From: "Ed Rodgers" <goose@andythepooh.com>


February 28, 2003 :: Scarlet and Grey Cafe :: Columbus
Cooked Goose Productions presents:

Inclination Part Deux

Back in September we started a Friday night to celebrate the broken beat.
This Edition of Inclination is featuring the finer sides of House and
Techno, mainly featuring Jason and Mike tag teaming throughout the night
with another special guest, jonathan kennedy aka black valentine.

Jason "Lemon" Lyman-(Godown, Brique Rouge Traxx, PCP)
10 years of experience under his belt and a wicked selection of House music
destined to make you dance.  Jason is returning for his second Inclination
appearance

Mike Salamon - (On the Floor, Polyphonic, DMBL) Columbus
Fresh back from a fall trip to Europe, Mike filled up his record bag with
some great techno that you just don't find here in the states all that
often.  He'll definately be dropping a pleasurable flavor of intelligent
music stylings.

Goose - (Cooked Goose, DMBL) Columbus
I whore myself out to diversity, but I always carry really cheesy music in
my bag if I'm feeling playful.  It's pretty much up in the air what style
I'll choose to drop when i show up after a fun 13 hours of work prior to
arriving, but it will probably be either breakbeat or house based stylings,
but I've had an itch to drop a downtempo hip hop set of old school... who
knows?

Scarlet and Grey Cafe
2203 N High Street (corner of Norwich and High)
$3 for 21+, $5 for 18-20 (bar adds 2 dollars for each underage head)

Subject: {pb-cle} Another track id request

mmm kay, this is from Deviant - True compliation that was posted a 
couple weeks ago.  In the middle of it, it fades out and comes back.  
the song that comes back is the one I'm trying to id.  Has no words 
in it, but I like the 'chorus' of it.  I chopped it up and I have the 
first five minutes of that song.  it's only encoded at 56kbps/22 KHz 
so even people with modems can download it (it's around 2 megs).  The 
link to it is http://www.vrillusions.com/xtrnl/pb-cle/trackid.mp3

--part1_10.2d64af6f.2b91644c_boundary

Get it while you can.   The Month End Set (MES) will go away and a new one 
will be up at the end of March.   The set will go offline tomorrow.

The Set is the Essential mix 11-05-2000 from Cut n' Paste, otherwise known as 
Plump DJs.   it's a free download.   The set is 135 megs in size but it is a 
fast site.   Those of you with DSL, Cable, or faster can get it within a few 
hours.

Get it at:
http://www.djbradanderson.com/mixes.php

This is one of my favorite mix sets ever. Burn it, listen to it.   It's good 
to have great music out there en mass.

Any ideas for next month?

  part of the reason he is tolerable (and i hate ALL childrens
  television, my son isnt allowed to watch any, though i guess he
  can check some mr rogers reruns) is that there was never a super
  huge corporate push to sell mr rogers mehandise like there is for
  EVERY single other children's product. granted, the guy had some
  records and whatnot, but its not like blues clues or barney or
  even sesame street. it was pretty hard to sell mr rogers, which is
  pretty much a good thing.=20
