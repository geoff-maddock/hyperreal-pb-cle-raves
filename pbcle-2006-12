Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} OK, It's about time! Qlimax 2006 Pictures!

What can I say:  What happens when you add 25,000 ravers, DJs, a huge 
sound system, more lasers than a gaggle of white trash people at a 
strip club, a crazy fucker in a jet pack, a 40 foot x 60 foot 
jumbotron that splits into 4 sections to move around on the stage, a 
40 foot high metal face, and 2 crazy fuckers 4,000 miles from home to 
a world cup soccer arena.  (other than the worlds longest run-on sentence?)

Qlimax 2006. Arnhem, NL.

Holy fuckballs batman.  They wouldn't let professional cameras into 
the event.  Do you think I would let this stop me? FUCK no! I 
traveled 4,000 miles to go to this party!  So, we disassembled the 
camera into pieces and smuggled each part in.  Sometimes needing to 
go through security 3 times to find someone stupid enough not to know 
what a camera lens looks like. (they DID have 30 security lines set 
up like the starting gate at the kentucky derby so it was easy enough 
to go to another line).  Boy was it worth it.

I just can't describe it.  Pictures (on my site 
http://www.silverraver.com/photos/Qlimax2006 ) and Videos (on my 
Myspace page until i can get them to play in Gallery: 
http://www.myspace.com/brianthechemist ) cannot do it justice.

Did I mention the overflowing abundance of gorgeous tall blonde dutch 
girls?  (oh my!, and they DO love american rave photographers!)

Best $1100 I ever spent for a weekend.

B

Jaded? Who's jaded?

first off, in true goose fashion, i must ask:  Where are the titties?

now that is out of the way,
http://www.silverraver.com/photos/Qlimax2006/114_1466

right.  there are the titties.

looks like it would have been an awesome show to be at, you'll have to be
sure to tell any stories about being 'the american rave photographer' with
these hot tall dutch women.  (hopefully you have the pictures of them?)...

Hmmm... hot dutch women aren't known for their titties I think.  I 
should have gotten pics of me with these girls, but i don't like 
being in front of the camera and, honestly it just didn't occur to 
me.  (i was, of course totally sideways most of the night)

Oh god it was insane. This girl: 
http://www.silverraver.com/photos/Qlimax2006/114_1472 had this 
strange thing where she just kept coming up and kissing me.  like 3 
or 4 times??? wtf?  I should have asked her what she was on so that I 
could use it for my own purposes!  There are some others scattered 
about, but I wasn't in "Creepy Photographer" mode, as I wasn't 
supposed to have the pro SLR that was in my bag, and i didn't want to 
get too much attention and get kicked out.  Plus, I'm just not creepy 
:P Apparently everyone figures that we just have raves like that over 
here and we don't care what happens everywhere else.  Got me, very 
strange!  It is rather difficult to talk to people in loud environs 
anyway when you're not native speakers of the same language and one 
or both parties may be mentally altered.  Most dutch people spoke 
english, but trying not to be an arrogant american I felt 
uncomfortable just speaking in english to them.  MY german is good 
enough, but unfortunately, dutch people dont' speak german.  I did 
meet alot of cool germans though.

The party was ALL one genre of music and only 1 room.  All Hardstyle, 
all night.  hard bangin insanity. good stuff.  I've never heard a dj 
over here play any hardstyle (although i'm told there is someone who 
does up in toronto)

They sell a DVD every year and the production quality of it is 
insane.  This is because they have STUDIO broadcast cameras 
everywhere.  The same shit you see on the nightly news.  There was 
one on a crane arm that went out over the crowd at least 50 
feet.  One of the crews interviewed me and one of my friends and 
asked us WHY?? we would travel so far for a party.  UH?? because it 
doesn't suck there?  I don't remember exactly what I said, but 
everyone seemed to make a big deal about how we came from the US just 
to go.  We'll see when the DVD comes out in february if I made it on 
or not.  I get the feeling that we may have been the people that 
traveled the farthest for the party.

I"m going to do what I can to get officially allowed to bring my rig 
next year, because the photographs i've seen from the event were 
mostly crap and I could tell from watching the photographers shooting 
there that they didn't know what they were doing.  They kept posing 
and setting up shots! WTF? It's not serendipity that I get all the 
good shots I get, come on people.

OOH, how pompous I am!

haha

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} OK, It's about time! Qlimax 2006 Pictures!

I still have about 50+ or so hardstyle records that sit in the
basement ever since I first saw the what was it... 03? 04? Qlimax DVD,
the one with that phat deepak track. It's just not cool if you haven't
seen the video or actually having been there.

I figured it would go the way of the dodo before too long, but it
seems like it's just too much fun to fade too quickly. Now if they'd
just stop letting Tiesto play arenas like that....

hardstyle is the new trance.  i've heard a few djs dabble into it at 
times, but noone diehard into it around here.  it gets kinda old real 
fast in the way carhornhardhouse does.  "deerrrr deeerrr

i have the mp3s from that and its like every 30 seconds the most 
annoying announcer comes on and keeps saying "SEEENNNSATTTION BLAAACKKK" 
and dumb stuff.  yuck.

that's because its a recording from the RADIO! yea, they play that 
shit on the radio.  id&t have their own radio show.  Bear in mind 
that these people don't speak english as their first language, so 
english has a "cool" novelty to them.  All the mega parties there 
have a theme to them and more of the story is told every year.  It's 
a cool idea I think, but the english announcers aren't very cool if 
you're not in the crowd feeding off the energy.

haha, there's your hot dutch girls goose!  I saw some guy walking 
around with a canon 30D and a crap lens with a flash taking random 
pictures of ravers as an "official" photographer.  Oh please.  I'll 
let these people take the people pictures, i'll take the art ones. haha.

People kept trying to look at the screen on the back of my film 
camera.  They just looked puzzled when no picture popped up.

I'll be at the blitzen party in CLE next weekend with my digital gear 
though (don't hit me!) because film is expensive! haha and i'm sure 
they aren't going to have a near million dollar stage production

haha how about boob art?

That's it! Goose you'd better come to the Blitzen gig, it's going to 
be boob art all night.  I wonder if there's enough time for a Tshirt 
to be made "I shoot Boob art... Show me your tits!"

Oh snap.  You should come over and check out my secret collection of 
Detroit pictures where I busted out the gyroscopically stabilized 
zoom lens.  haha... Thats some good shit.

haha how about boob art?<br><br>
That's it! Goose you'd better come to the Blitzen gig, it's going to be
boob art all night.&nbsp; I wonder if there's enough time for a Tshirt to
be made &quot;I shoot Boob art... Show me your tits!&quot;<br><br>
Oh snap.&nbsp; You should come over and check out my secret collection of
Detroit pictures where I busted out the gyroscopically stabilized zoom
lens.&nbsp; haha... Thats some good shit.<br><br>

Tell them it's the new digital cameras with 50mp resolution (or  
whatever mp equivelent film is) and that it records on to high tech  
film that requires a special "developing" process to extract all the  
1's and 0's...  or you can just say "here's the picture" and shoot  
that insanely bright flash at them.

"Dont hit me"?  Even your digital gear pretty much pwns anyone else's  
camera setup.  You carry it around a freakin huge pelican case in 30  
parts, or is that just your film camera?

There's that one guy in pgh that's been playing hardstyle a lot  
lately.  Not really big on it either because of the annoyingly long  
breakdowns they always put in it.

Yeah, I have the "megamixes" that I guess came with the dvd that you  
could get, minus the "SENSAAAAATION.... BLACKKKK" it's not bad.  I  
also have a video of the megamix they did.  I guess for about 45 mins  
or so they played a premixed, pre-choreographed set and had full on  
fireworks and stuff.

I think japanese is cool but I'm not walking around shouting  
"KAWAII!!!!" and "SUGOI!!" every 30 seconds.  Or saying stuff like  
"watashi wa baka no gaijin desu" and "eki wa doko desu ka?" just  
because I know what those mean (wonder if Naoko is on this list?  
she'd get a kick from one of those phrases)

Yea, its def the DJ for hardstyle sucking for you guys.  I've heard 
good and bad sets depending on the track selection.  There's alot of 
bad tracks out there.

It's kinda like saying "I don't like jungle because i heard this guy 
spinning it in his garage and it was terrible"  well, I think jungle 
sucks, but even I'll listen to a good jungle set.

I know, I have some of that stuff, and I've heard at least the  
compiled sensation black mixes.  It's just like most of the trance  
genres, there's a lot of crap with a couple good ones.  Heck, I'm  
guessing both mine and trout's acid trance/techno labels consist of  
three labels: Smitten, Stay up forever, and VCF, with an occasional  
other one in there.

Yeah, Aprodite's set was great at bring it back 3.  Didn't recall  
hearing anyone say his set sucked.  I'm not a fan of house, but I  
still have a couple house mixes that I'll listen to on rare occasion.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OC_bntzP7o

Detroit-born, Chicago-and-Berlin-based Alan D. Oldham has been called 
"Detroit Techno's Renaissance Man" (Muzik, UK). A lifelong cartoonist 
and graphic designer, a young Oldham published his own comic book 
"Johnny Gambit" in 1987 to local notoriety. Hired that same year by 
Derrick May to illustrate several memorable pieces for the new Transmat 
label, led to Oldham's first involvement in the fledgling techno scene. 
Under his alias DJ T-1000, he has rocked crowds in Berlin, Rome, Warsaw, 
Barcelona, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and all points in between with his own brand 
of funky-ass techno. When he's not behind the decks or producing music 
for labels like Tresor Berlin, Pure Sonik and xfive, he's an illustrator 
who has shown in galleries in Chicago, Paris and Los Angeles. Showcasing 
his own productions, this fearless operator truly encompasses all that 
is "Electronica", combining film music with New Wave melodies, monotone 
club anthems with Grunge-inflected guitar feedback. Oldham`s output has 
taken down the borders, combined the concepts and blended the elements 
into autobiographical narrative. A true legend.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Kevin C. Smith is a musician and (bedroom) producer who also turns
obsolete toys and children's keyboards into unique musical
instruments through circuit bending. He will give an overview of
circuit bending including what to bend and basic techniques. He will
also present and demonstrate such circuit bent instruments as the
voice changing megaphone, Speak & Spell, and Casio SK-1.

Garth Zeglin is a professional roboticist and a journeyman artist.
His day job is developing legged robots at the Carnegie Mellon
Robotics Institute, but his quest is finding his artistic voice in
more poetic machinery. His current projects include robots suspended
in the air, talking mirrors, and pneumatic percussion instruments. He
is fascinated by elegantly simple technology and dynamic behavior,
and he seeks to balance his love of gadgetry with the expressive
needs of the work. The talk will include a short overview of past
projects, then zoom in on current work, presenting both technical and
artistic rationales, and culminate in a live demo during the break.

who's goin?  I'll be there.  Yes, i'm coming out of hiding.

We should have a NET MEET.. holy shitballs.  how long has it been

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Who's going to Blitzen?

I once made a "joke" pitt ID with the name of "anita cockintheass" so 
that someone could ride the pgh busses for free.  I'd laugh if the 
bus driver looked closely at the name!!

So who's goin?

so far we've got:

Brian SillyRaver
Trouty McSoup
VR (aka Derk's McCracken)
Andy 'i'm too cool to actually sign up' James.

'Amanda Hugandkiss, I need amanda hugandkiss, Why can't I find amanda 
hugandkiss!?'
"Maybe your standards are too high!"

haha.

We shouldn't have it at 2:22 because then andy won't be able to make 
it.  And us jaded oldskool techno snobs need to be in FULL effect, so 
to speak. so as to counteract the "wow, it's my first time at a 
party, are you ROLLING" contingent.

DIE in a fire I say.
haha  Now that would be a good tshirt.

Pb-CLE raves:
Go die in a fire.

I'm terribly sorry to hear about this horrible lost.  I can only imagine what Zone and his roommates have been experiencing lately.  

My hat goes off to you Dave.  You are a good-hearted person.  

May there be good things to cheer about in the near future to bring everyone a smile.  Keep it real...

Subject: {pb-cle} Paul Alexander - Sighting #07.12.06: Behind the Door

In an effort to record, define, and regurgitate my personal spotting of the 
illustrious "H", I have created this mix. It may or may not shed light on 
the brief experience that I had, as I was eating a sandwich at the time and 
it was kind of dark in there. I did see some little helmet peek out from 
behind a door, a door which I could only describe as "the" door, because 
since mayonnaise is really really good, it got me thinking to how all doors 
in this world are probably connected. I do not know if I am being watched or 
not; I suspect the sandwich to have something to do with it.

This will not be on the discovery channel, because nobody would watch it. I 
will, however, replicate this on to compact disc for redundancy and high 
availability purposes.

Goahead Productions presents:

"Winterdelica"

A psychedelic winter celebration!

Live Sets:

Mubali - (Trishula Recs, Mistress of Evil Records) California/Chicago, IL

Greg Farley has been involved in the psychedelic trance scene in Northern
California for over 5 years. After several years of being a dj and event
coordinator, he began to produce his own music in the summer of 2003.
Assisted and influenced by San Francisco artists such as Quasar, Ocelot, the
Nommos, Chromatone, and Penta. Mubali's music began appearing on various
labels like Mistress of Evil Records, Geomagnetic TV, Trishula Records,
Insomnia Recs, and Manic Dragon Recs. In March of 2006, Trishula Records
released Mubali's debut full length titled "Cats at Play." His music style
can be called nighttime, aggressive, psychedelic music, and this year he has
been doing a lot of collaborations with many artists such as Naked Tourist,
Highko, Arahat, Bodhisattva 13:20, and Electrypnose. Be prepared for his
sonic onslaught and holographic textures.

Xyla - (Mistress of Evil Records, Shaman Films) San Francisco/Medina, Ohio

Dark, abrasive, aggressive, and beautiful; these are words that describe the
sound of the well-known producer from San Francisco.  Her experimental style
draws upon several genres including industrial, power noise, and trance.
Xyla brings us a new concept in what we call dark electronic music. She has
recently relocated from San Francisco to Medina, Ohio, and we are very happy
to have her here with us! For those who missed her epic live set at Chimera,
here is a rewind for you with new tracks from her album.



Dj's:

Lauryn - (Peak Records, 28thDay) New York City

This Goahead date with Lauryn is long overdue! Lauryn's passion for music
has been a constant all her life. She began playing the violin when she was
9 years old. Her love of music led her to begin djing and producing her own
psytrance radio show while attending college. In 2002, Lauryn moved to
Boston where she helped start Psyforia. Recently relocated to New York City,
Lauryn is a label dj with Peak Rec (Switzerland) and is affiliated with
28thday(NYC) and Mistical Productions(Texas). In the past six years, Lauryn
has played across the US and in Europe, sharing the stage with many
well-known international acts. She is known for her energetic, nighttime,
funky full-on, psychedelic sets, as well as the occasional morning
progressive grooves. Check out one of Lauryn's mixes at:

http://www.zia-trance.com/mp3s/lauryn-pinot-grigio.mp3

Sweet Chaos - (Sidetrakkt, Be Here Now Collective) Pittsburgh

Well-known psytrance veteran, Sweet Chaos, comes to play for Ohio, bringing
a mish mash of mind bending, spirit mending, good ol' fashioned shoe
stompin' psytrance!

Meghan - (Goahead) Cleveland/Akron

Our Meghan needs no introduction. She has been tearing it up all over the
U.S this year! Meghan will get things started and set the proper mood for
the evening. You can check out her live mix from Philadelphia at the Gaian
Mind monthly.

Subject: {pb-cle} Blitzen Net-meat?

mmMMmmmm Meat.

So who's goin?

so far we've got:

Brian SillyRaver
Trouty McSoup
VR (aka Derk's McCracken)
Andy 'i'm too cool to actually sign up' James.
Meghan
Luke (probably, if meghan's powers of mind control are working properly)
Nick S
Dan & Adrian

UH... kinda pointless to have a netmeat if we already know each 
other.. hmmmm  NO new listees?  Trout!? you're not doing a good job recruiting!

I'm going to try to bring this back oldschool.  Maybe i'll get all 
off-topic and run around like an insane person with a camera.  Could be fun.

Jaded? Who's jaded?

This has some information on the whole pauly scandal.  Apparently it was
staged from the Odessa police.  Kind of lame I guess, but oh well.
If you look at the video it does seem like he moved just at the right time
to make it seem its real.

Or something.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Entertainment

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OC_bntzP7o

Detroit-born, Chicago-and-Berlin-based Alan D. Oldham has been called 
"Detroit Techno's Renaissance Man" (Muzik, UK). A lifelong cartoonist 
and graphic designer, a young Oldham published his own comic book 
"Johnny Gambit" in 1987 to local notoriety. Hired that same year by 
Derrick May to illustrate several memorable pieces for the new Transmat 
label, led to Oldham's first involvement in the fledgling techno scene. 
Under his alias DJ T-1000, he has rocked crowds in Berlin, Rome, Warsaw, 
Barcelona, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and all points in between with his own brand 
of funky-ass techno. When he's not behind the decks or producing music 
for labels like Tresor Berlin, Pure Sonik and xfive, he's an illustrator 
who has shown in galleries in Chicago, Paris and Los Angeles. Showcasing 
his own productions, this fearless operator truly encompasses all that 
is "Electronica", combining film music with New Wave melodies, monotone 
club anthems with Grunge-inflected guitar feedback. Oldham`s output has 
taken down the borders, combined the concepts and blended the elements 
into autobiographical narrative. A true legend.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Kevin C. Smith is a musician and (bedroom) producer who also turns
obsolete toys and children's keyboards into unique musical
instruments through circuit bending. He will give an overview of
circuit bending including what to bend and basic techniques. He will
also present and demonstrate such circuit bent instruments as the
voice changing megaphone, Speak & Spell, and Casio SK-1.

Garth Zeglin is a professional roboticist and a journeyman artist.
His day job is developing legged robots at the Carnegie Mellon
Robotics Institute, but his quest is finding his artistic voice in
more poetic machinery. His current projects include robots suspended
in the air, talking mirrors, and pneumatic percussion instruments. He
is fascinated by elegantly simple technology and dynamic behavior,
and he seeks to balance his love of gadgetry with the expressive
needs of the work. The talk will include a short overview of past
projects, then zoom in on current work, presenting both technical and
artistic rationales, and culminate in a live demo during the break.

early cause we'll be coming from my work xmas party, so not sure how long
we'll stay (open bar on the company's tab usually brings out the excess
drinking in me).

Subject: {pb-cle} blitzen review

First off I'm sorry, no pictures.  I saw the big sign saying no pictures
and assumed that was the case, although I saw a few people with cameras.
 Could have sneaked them in though

Wow, that's about all I said when not only was there line to get in at
8:30 PM or so when I got there, but there was probably a couple hundred
people there already.  I didn't even know it started that early (was
going to a preparty that the host wanted to be there at 8:00).  I
figured get there around 9 or 10 and people would start to file in.

There ended up being a lot of people there.  I suck at estimating, but I
would say 1,000 tickets were sold at least.  Again, unheard of for a
cleveland party.

It doesn't end there, the music /variety/ was very good.  Yes, I'm not a
big fan of house, but there were two other rooms playing that I could go
to.  Also pretty much all the standard genres were represented in the
main room.  Was nice to hear even breakcore-ish type stuff (not sure if
it was truly breakcore, he was the first dj on for those that were
there).  The main room had plenty of sound and lights.  Sound was good
in other two rooms as well, although I guess the monitors were clipping
in the goodvibes room according to traaaat.  I even mentioned to couple
people that at one point there was [epic] trance playing in the main
room and then more [pussy] trance in the goodvibes room (only people
that like it can call it pussy trance :)) and then unsure of the third room.

Like I said, got there around 8:30 - 9:00 and I guess there were a
couple sound issues.  The main room didn't get started till after 10:00
I think.  Aside from that, there wasn't really any issues I could
recall.  There was a lot of security, but they weren't constantly up in
your face, so even that was good (I'm actually a big fan of security at
venues so if someone gets too raved out, you could find a security guy
pretty easy.  Since, unlike in toronto, they can't have paramedics on
hand since that would mean they expect something bad to happen, or
however that rave act is worded).

Definitely one of the better parties in ohio.  Oddly enough this wasn't
anyone's "first rave" that I usually hear about.  Although I didn't go
to the afterparty, which is where people mention that stuff.

Hey all,

Had boatloads of fun on sat night at blitzen 2.

I think Andy James' Hard fuckin BANGING techno set was the highlight 
of the night for me.  Dude, next time, don't forget your MD recorder!

Thanks to the guys at GSP, I pretty much had my run of the place and 
was testing a out a new camera (It's a Canon Eos 1D for you geeks out 
there).  I think it passed with flying colors. Not quite as good as 
film, but certainly passable. :P

Yea, don't hurt me, it IS digital at a rave, but boy is it 
cheaper.  And anyway, these professional cameras were designed to 
have output that looks like film.  This camera is legendary for its 
"filminess" actually.  I narrowed it down to about 80 keepers, and 
some are almost duplicates because i can't decide which I like the 
best.  I would probably have to shoot 7 or 8 rolls of film to get as 
many winners!  Total cost for something like that would be well over $250.

Anyway, i'll let you decide.  CHeck them out:

Enjoy!

im way sick of chop and screw myself too...le merge must be friends with the 
promoters for that cherry timeslot....

t-1000 should never be booked for less then 3 hours imho...and definately 
shouldnt be on a 11:15.

photek killed it....i havent felt bass like that in a long time...im glad 
adam f was a no show honestly...i was expecting a more drumfunk heavy 
set...but was pleasently surprised with all the new ragga he 
played...raggamuffins take note...you neednt constantly edit the amen and 
play at 185+ to mash down ragga.

donald glaude played a pretty decent set as did jekyl and hyde from what i 
heard...but i didnt catch much of either set...as i was hunting down/being 
hunted down to setup for afterhours.

good party tho...altho i was pretty sleepy and everyone thought i looked 
generally miserable(i was kinda tired out from a bunch of bs ive been 
dealing with, but i always kinda look miserable i guess what can i say, im 
just not a people person)...someone wanna tell me where all those kids came 
from??? i know most of the pb-cle crew i saw said something along the lines 
of "damn i feel old"....i know from working the door at the after hours i 
saw id's from georgia, cali, ny, jersey, vermont, pa, maryland, and the 
european union(WTF!)...but taht was only half of the ids i saw...i guess you 
bring out enough headliners people from all over will come out.

sorry if i id'ed any of you old folks at the afterhours needlessly...i was 
real tired at that point...i bet i made some of you old fuckers feel good 
tho eh?  ;-)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} blitzen review

pix: http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/2006-12-16-blitzen2

disjointed review cut-n-paste from mah blog:

the whole blitzen experience lasted me about 24 hours and is the gift 
that keeps on giving.

so theres this girl i met on orkut (sorta myspace site that never took 
off here but did in spanish speaking countries). she was coming to the 
US from brazil for a few months for a job and wanted to know about the 
cleveland party scene (response: on life support, that plug sure is 
awful loose?) and a few other things. anyhow we pick her up and detour 
around clevo. i think we took the loopy roundabout way, it really seemed 
to take a long time. or maybe i have no idea where things are in clev. 
i'm suspecting the latter. anyhow. for a ohio party we made it there 
ultra-early at like 9:15. people were already there which was kind of a 
surprise to me. sweetness.

tenable at the door didn't seem to have a grip on things. its early, 
shit happens. i guess they never did get a grip on it even later from 
what everyone told me. i have never heard one good thing about tenable, 
and i guess it stays that way.

seriously everyone was there, okay i know like 15 people that werent, 
and they suck. i couldnt't get much more than 5-10 feet before running 
into someone and getting caught up in idle chatter for the longest time.

the music was pretty hot/cold with at times. as in really hot shit and 
well lets wander kinda stuff others (yes i'm a technodorksnob, get over 
it, i have). we'd go wander around and hear jungle on 2 (maybe 3?) 
stages at the same time. ditto on prog trance. maybe a few time slot 
changes would have given variety between stages? ionno. i heard some 
awesome sets. adam f got stuck in BFE at some airport, and aparantly 
photek didnt have shit to do and was in the neighborhood in thieveland 
and dropped some sick fucking shit. as in serious sick shit. as in the 
crowd seemed to call for rewinds rather than the mc. we spent the night 
mostly going from stage to stage and mostly heard good stuff. yey for 
good music. never really settled in any one room but there was choonz 
somewhere most of the night. and damned if we didn't land in the 
hall-type area during the lulls.

so dayanna had never before seen a candy raver. bill pointed out a 
legion of dayton candy ravers (yes. like a dozen with matching 
raverwear). she picked up the concept of candy real fast and seems to 
have a like for it, she collected a lil bit thru the night, the birth of 
a candyraver? oddly so did i. how does that keep happening? heh! 
language was an issue at times with the bass kickin, but not too bad in 
the car. still a sooper awesome time hanging out with her. yey!

she was worried about getting home and wanted to take a bus, as a 
non-bus type person this seemed like absolute madness at 6am-ish in 
cleveland. do busses run that early? and how do you know where to go. 
busses scare me, i'll continue avoiding them, thankyouverymuch. anyhow, 
todd the afterpartypooper ran her home. booo! okay. joking. i felt kinda 
crappy/weird about that coz it was all rushed and pressured and somehow 
i had the answer, like cell phones were ringing with the WTF tone. yeah. 
that one.

afterhours! a couple of pgh ppl didn't seem interested in the official 
one and ppl asked me about mine. saywhaaaa? i was a tad confused. yeah, 
that happens, but no afterhours in the wings (as in our car had no plans 
yet, coz things seemed to be evolving).... talk to a few ppl and 
apparently someone started the rumour that i was having one. i 
guesstimate 3-4 cars and 15ish ppl from who i talk to and it would be 
pretty chill in my room and would be cool. what i didnt take into 
account is that amazing raver network. derrr. i didn't notice till 
turning the corner down the streen that there was a line of 8, maybe 10 
cars. i hoped they werent following us. they were. whuupssss... it was a 
clusterfuck. parking was scarce but everyone found a spot on the street. 
aparently one end to the other. all these ppl coming up to the door, 
which was locked, WTF. i dont have a key? i dont think there is a key? 
so i gotta be a dickhead and bang on the roomies window. someone else 
did most of the banging coz, well i hate waking people up, i appreciate 
the finer points of sleep'n in.

so the door opens, ppl come in, and..... A BATHROOM LINE FORMS. i got a 
good laugh out of that. ppl filtered into my room the living room, ppl 
crashed here and there, ppl hung out in the basement, smokers on the 
porch, ppl sitting in the driveway. looks like some took a walk 
somewhere and were out and about. ravers were everywhere. ahahha. but no 
real issues. a few minor nothings. i'm so plurry today it didnt phase 
me. roomies were surprisingly okay with the raver invasion. kitties kept 
to their areas and sorta checked things out but didn't really hang out. 
ppl were still coming and going into afternoon. crazy. serously, i live 
40 mins away from cleveland. but i guess it's on the way home for the 
pgh cru.

all in all a sooperdooper 24+ hours. last couple were reallllly chill 
but ppl were chatty and its all good. soooooooooo???? how many days till 
gfznye????? omgomgomgicantwait!!!!!!!!!!

random good: awesome time, raver pen that was left on my desk (lights 
up), raver night light left on the floor (sorta lights up stairs now). a 
couple ppl i've had bad impressions with in the past showing up at our 
house and leaving me with good impressions! someone left a badass candy 
bracelet on our fridge made of what looks like hematite (shiny grey, so 
its about the right color for me)

random bad: couple minor details, last minute raver disorganization 
plans (that like the a-team somehow come together), about 3 times more 
ppl than i guessed would show up at our house (luckily everyone was very 
well behaved. awesome), bent spoon (and not cheapie thin metal ones!! 
wtf. seriously), busted toy. me forgetting the roomie had his son for 
the weekend. bad juju. mouse on my one pc died, i donno if i have 
another whatever. i'm vnc'ing into that computer now. wheeeeeeeeeee

too many ppl made the night tick to shout out. but jeff. seriously. gold 
stars. you deserve some fucking serious gold fucking stars. you are up 
there on my raver hardcore list with the ppl that have done 7 days of 
parties in a row and dan kelly for freq fest after getting his sinuses 
tore the shit out, also to those of you that have driven 12 hours for a 
6 hour party. i salute you, and stick virtual gold stars on your computer.

i'm done rambling. i need sleep. ignore this blogumentary. these are not 
the droids you are looking for.

We *would've* been there, but see below:

> the weekend.

Yeah, so it's almost 8:00 AM and 5-year-old Jaden has just gotten up and
come into our room. Some random dude sees him and goes, "Well HEllooOOOO
little man!!!" Jaden just stares at him. I decide to close the door to our
room and tell Jaden he can watch cartoons. It's funny now, but kinda
freaky then.

And yes, seriously, WTF?: "random bad: bent spoon (and not cheapie thin
metal ones!!" Who the fuck bent my spoon?!!! There were plenty of cheapo
easily-bendable spoons that you could have taken, but no, you had to grab
one of my expensive German art deco replica spoons that is hard as fuck to
bend. Brian Silverraver has the same set -- he knows how much they cost!
Damn. Oh well, I'll get over it.

:)

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

will quickly realize why this is one of Pittsburgh's most legendary

WINTERDELICA  - SAT. JANUARY 20, 2007 - Kin 127: BLUE PLANETARY HAND

Goahead Productions presents:

"Winterdelica"

A psychedelic winter celebration!

Live Sets:

*Mubali - (Trishula Recs, Mistress of Evil Records) California/Chicago, 
IL

Greg Farley has been involved in the psychedelic trance scene in
Northern California for over 5 years. After several years of being a
dj and event coordinator, he began to produce his own music in the
summer of 2003. Assisted and influenced by San Francisco artists such
as Quasar, Ocelot, the Nommos, Chromatone, and Penta. Mubali's music
began appearing on various labels like Mistress of Evil Records,
Geomagnetic TV, Trishula Records, Insomnia Recs, and Manic Dragon
Recs. In March of 2006, Trishula Records released Mubali's debut full
length titled "Cats at Play." His music style can be called nighttime,
aggressive, psychedelic music, and this year he has been doing a lot
of collaborations with many artists such as Naked Tourist, Highko,
Arahat, Bodhisattva 13:20, and Electrypnose. Be prepared for his sonic
onslaught and holographic textures.

*Xyla - (Mistress of Evil Records, Shaman Films) San Francisco/Medina, 
Ohio

Dark, abrasive, aggressive, and beautiful; these are words that
describe the sound of the well-known producer from San Francisco.  Her
experimental style draws upon several genres including industrial,
power noise, and trance.  Xyla brings us a new concept in what we call
dark electronic music. She has recently relocated from San Francisco
to Medina, Ohio, and we are very happy to have her here with us! For
those who missed her epic live set at Chimera, here is a rewind for
you with new tracks from her album.

Dj's:

*Lauryn - (Peak Records, 28thDay) New York City

This Goahead date with Lauryn is long overdue! Lauryn's passion for
music has been a constant all her life. She began playing the violin
when she was 9 years old. Her love of music led her to begin djing and
producing her own psytrance radio show while attending college. In
2002, Lauryn moved to Boston where she helped start Psyforia. Recently
relocated to New York City, Lauryn is a label dj with Peak Rec

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Kevin C. Smith is a musician and (bedroom) producer who also turns
obsolete toys and children's keyboards into unique musical
instruments through circuit bending. He will give an overview of
circuit bending including what to bend and basic techniques. He will
also present and demonstrate such circuit bent instruments as the
voice changing megaphone, Speak & Spell, and Casio SK-1.
http://panafonic.blogspot.com

Garth Zeglin is a professional roboticist and a journeyman artist.
His day job is developing legged robots at the Carnegie Mellon
Robotics Institute, but his quest is finding his artistic voice in
more poetic machinery. His current projects include robots suspended
in the air, talking mirrors, and pneumatic percussion instruments. He
is fascinated by elegantly simple technology and dynamic behavior,
and he seeks to balance his love of gadgetry with the expressive
needs of the work. The talk will include a short overview of past
projects, then zoom in on current work, presenting both technical and
artistic rationales, and culminate in a live demo during the break.

BASTARDS!

No one touches the fine silverware!! That shit is irreplaceable.  Not 
only is/was it expensive they do not make it anymore. It is actually 
in a movie.  If you watch 'Independence day', in the part where they 
have the alien's body that Will Smith's character retrieved from the 
spacecraft and they are inspecting it, Brent Spiner's character takes 
the knife from THAT silverware set and uses it to cut open the body 
of the alien! haha.  fhe fucked up stuff I notice.

THe knife was the reason I bought the silverware, and the reason that 
I got to keep all of it when annie and I split up.  It is awesome 
looking but impossible to spread peanut butter with, apparently.  Got 
me, not a peanutbutter person.

how the fuck do you bend one of those spoons anyway? trying to loosen 
the lugnuts on a car? those things are SOLID.

crackheads, nothing is safe from them :P

I hid the torch. I've found it in too many random places throughout the
house, so now *only I* should know where it is.

Last afterparty at my house someone broke a Reidel crystal chardonnay
glass (after using it to drink water or soda), but that was my fault for
*owning* the glasses in the first place and having them in plain view in
my china cabinet. Obviously, someone couldn't tell the difference between
it and some other casual drinking glass that I have plenty of in the
kitchen.

Someone has to brag for him...

Recap of Snowballz, holiday party at the Kelly's


What a party!

Thursday night I ended up doing all the preparations, I didn't finish
until 2pm on Friday afternoon. I slept an hour then got up at 3pm and
people were already filtering in for the party.

Things started getting busy around 10pm as usual. A ton of people
filtered through the house over the next 24 hrs. Many people brought
food and drink and gifts.

The night went really smooth with a progression of people coming and
going all night and into the next day. it was pretty damn packed
around 3am, probably the peak of people. There was an amazingly good
vibe for a drinking party.

I remember at one point sitting in the PLUR room on the edge of the
bed, a ton of guys and girls all tangled into a puddle. The lighting
was perfect, the noise was perfect, the music was pumping just right,
everyone was just beautiful, sophisticated, smiling, and friendly. The
vibe and everything was just hitting the G-Spot... I thought it was
about the coolest fucking thing ever, and I thought to myself "I dont
remember ever going to parties as cool as this"... Then I felt
amazingly good and proud that I could be a part of bringing that to
everyone, for a second I felt like I gave that to everyone, then I
thought - "What makes a party as good as this?" and realized that it's
all about the people there - my friends. It's the partiers that make
the party, and I felt really good about my friends. I realized that I
really do have some kick-ass friends, and they make my life good. I'm
lucky. I'm happy.

Anyhow, there was a particulary awesome hot ass lesbian that I'll
refer to here as S. Anyhow S was hot and on a roll. I remember hearing
her say to trout "Theres alot of hot ass bitches here tonight, we
should go hunt them down and make out with them" Trout was like "I was
just thinking the same thing", and off they went. Well I think they
seduced over 1/2 of the girls at the party, and ended up taking them
down into the basement and well lets just say S has her shit down pat,
it takes her about 3 seconds to give the girl an O... I witnessed it
once and I was actually fucking shocked. They are both GODs in my
book. Trout deserves the raver Crown... one day I'll find an
appropriate crown and present it to him.

There was some drama with a spoiled boy that ignored his girl all
night, while talking to other girls, then got jealous when people
tried to give her attention... blah. I don't really konw how it ended,
but it was a minor stain on the night. It happens though... when 150+
people go through your house in a night, some drama is bound to
unfold.

Finally I made Hot Karl and his group leave around 10pm, only because
some of the riders in his car were causing an undue amount of drama
about wanting to leave right away because they were just plain drama
filled and wanted to go home. Anyhow I felt bad about making them
leave because #1: Hot Karl is one of the coolest motherfuckers I know
and I love to have him around, and #2: I thought they were too tired
to drive all the way to michigan... but I didnt want the
drama-bringers around either and wanted to support them getting home.
Anyhow they left and started heading home, but then realized they were
too tired to get there without falling asleep, and called me up, I
welcomed them back... so we're sitting around with no drugs or alcohol
to do, and I remember that someone had left me a bottle of liquid
Koolness in the fridge. We all donned our chefs hats and together we
kooked it down into a usable form. Anyhow, we proceeded to demolish it
all in about an hour, and it was Kiddy Kandy land upstairs in the PLUR
room. It was so much fucking fun I can't even begin to describe it. It
was the perfect ending to it all. It was Adrienne, Hot Karl, Ketamine
fried Trout, Statik the Spunky one, Hot Sawse, and myself (and
DaisySTAR). After a while, we all melted into one extremely tangled
plur puddle on the bed, and fell asleep. It was so special and perfect
and awesome bonding that I'm sure I'll rememeber that moment and mood
for the rest of my life.

Awards?

King Krown of the night goes to Trout Soup. He earned his wings. I
wanna buy him tatoos for his neck, outlines of naked girls with a big
red X over them, I guess he gets like 10 of them.

Koolest new friend? Statik the Spunky one. She's got such a good head
on her shoulders, and knows where to draw the line and how to deal
with everyone. I only wish I had what she has when I was her age. It's
hard not to love her in some shape or form.

Koolest rediscovered old friend? Hott Karl. This guy and I are gonna
be close friends for a long time. He and I think alot alike, except
he's more like I want to be then I really am.

Koolest chick? Sawse! her name is so perfect, without her our Kandy
Land Kuddle Puddle would have been a bunch of vegtables and meatheads,
but she added the special sawse to make it a tasty dish.

Sexiest, most understanding, incomprehensably magnetic femme of the
night? My wife Adrienne of course. I love her more than anything, and
I love her more and more every day.

Thanks to all my friends for coming and giving me the best Xmas ever.

With that out of the way. Does anyone know how the couch upstairs got
broken? I just hope it was an accident and not some vandalism. I dont
even want to know who broke it I just want to know it was an accident.

Anyhow, it was all so much fun... right now everyone is gone and
everyone is busy doing stuff, and it was such a quick shutdown, and
there's nothing to do. I'm so damn bored and kinda lonely, after 30
hours of insane fun and happiness, it's hard to go back to just
hanging out with no guests around.

If anyone gets bored in the next day or 2, come hit us up :)


Dan K

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Take the freshest, most cutting-edge house and breaks DJs, spread them 
across two floors, add one of the best sound systems on the east coast 
and throw in a packed house that's ready to get down. That's the formula 
that's been used since the beginning, and once you see it in action you 
will quickly realize why this is one of Pittsburgh's most legendary 
parties year after year.

Welcome the advent of 2007 with open arms, open ears, and friendly 
peers.

WINTERDELICA  - SAT. JANUARY 20, 2007 - Kin 127: BLUE PLANETARY HAND

Goahead Productions presents:

"Winterdelica"

A psychedelic winter celebration!

Live Sets:

*Mubali - (Trishula Recs, Mistress of Evil Records) California/Chicago, 
IL

Greg Farley has been involved in the psychedelic trance scene in
Northern California for over 5 years. After several years of being a
dj and event coordinator, he began to produce his own music in the
summer of 2003. Assisted and influenced by San Francisco artists such
as Quasar, Ocelot, the Nommos, Chromatone, and Penta. Mubali's music
began appearing on various labels like Mistress of Evil Records,
Geomagnetic TV, Trishula Records, Insomnia Recs, and Manic Dragon
Recs. In March of 2006, Trishula Records released Mubali's debut full
length titled "Cats at Play." His music style can be called nighttime,
aggressive, psychedelic music, and this year he has been doing a lot
of collaborations with many artists such as Naked Tourist, Highko,
Arahat, Bodhisattva 13:20, and Electrypnose. Be prepared for his sonic
onslaught and holographic textures.

*Xyla - (Mistress of Evil Records, Shaman Films) San Francisco/Medina, 
Ohio

Dark, abrasive, aggressive, and beautiful; these are words that
describe the sound of the well-known producer from San Francisco.  Her
experimental style draws upon several genres including industrial,
power noise, and trance.  Xyla brings us a new concept in what we call
dark electronic music. She has recently relocated from San Francisco
to Medina, Ohio, and we are very happy to have her here with us! For
those who missed her epic live set at Chimera, here is a rewind for
you with new tracks from her album.

Dj's:

*Lauryn - (Peak Records, 28thDay) New York City

This Goahead date with Lauryn is long overdue! Lauryn's passion for
music has been a constant all her life. She began playing the violin
when she was 9 years old. Her love of music led her to begin djing and
producing her own psytrance radio show while attending college. In
2002, Lauryn moved to Boston where she helped start Psyforia. Recently
relocated to New York City, Lauryn is a label dj with Peak Rec
(Switzerland) and is affiliated with 28thday(NYC) and Mistical
Productions(Texas). In the past six years, Lauryn has played across
the US and in Europe, sharing the stage with many well-known
international acts. She is known for her energetic, nighttime, funky
full-on, psychedelic sets, as well as the occasional morning
progressive grooves. Check out one of Lauryn's mixes at:

http://www.zia-trance.com/mp3s/lauryn-pinot-grigio.mp3

*Sweet Chaos - (Sidetrakkt, Be Here Now Collective) Pittsburgh

Well-known psytrance veteran, Sweet Chaos, comes to play for
Ohio, bringing a mish mash of mind bending, spirit mending, good ol'
fashioned shoe stompin' psytrance!

*Meghan - (Goahead) Cleveland/Akron

Our Meghan needs no introduction. She has been tearing it up all over
the U.S this year! Meghan will get things started and set the proper
mood for the evening. You can check out her live mix from Philadelphia
at the Gaian Mind monthly.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Kevin C. Smith is a musician and (bedroom) producer who also turns
obsolete toys and children's keyboards into unique musical
instruments through circuit bending. He will give an overview of
circuit bending including what to bend and basic techniques. He will
also present and demonstrate such circuit bent instruments as the
voice changing megaphone, Speak & Spell, and Casio SK-1.

Garth Zeglin is a professional roboticist and a journeyman artist.
His day job is developing legged robots at the Carnegie Mellon
Robotics Institute, but his quest is finding his artistic voice in
more poetic machinery. His current projects include robots suspended
in the air, talking mirrors, and pneumatic percussion instruments. He
is fascinated by elegantly simple technology and dynamic behavior,
and he seeks to balance his love of gadgetry with the expressive
needs of the work. The talk will include a short overview of past
projects, then zoom in on current work, presenting both technical and
artistic rationales, and culminate in a live demo during the break.

Subject: {pb-cle} NYE

So they pulled a fast one on me at work and gave me both NYE *and* Day
off! (That schedule was obviously made before word got out I'm dumping
them for a better-paying, less corporate job two weeks from now.) Anyway,
since I assumed I had to work, I never got tickets to the big shindig in
Toronto that Trouty and Co. are going to and I'm wondering whoall is doing
what for NYE in the pb-cle. My christmas was SHITTY, and I'm hoping to
make up for it. Suggestions?

Tickets are still available for the Toronto party Trout & Co are going to.
I haven't had the opportunity to ask what day they're going up there,
because they need to be picked up in person.  I may get an acquaintance from
Toronto to stop in and do that for me in the next day or so.

Yeah was about to say that.  They are sold out online, but from a couple
weeks ago there was "still plenty at local outlets" not sure how
plentiful they still are though.

I was needing an extra one for a while but I have it now.

Anyhow ask Trout to talk to Sammy D or Bud, they may have an extra

Subject: {pb-cle} Entropy's top 10 albums for 2006

DJ Entropy's Top 10 albums of 2006:

1) hellogoodbye - Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs!
Best album of the year, hands down.  The best danceable rock, or rock n
roll dance album since last years P!ATD's debut!  Vocoder-d vocals, strong
beats, synth lines, punk rock guitars, and electro skirmishes rule the day
here, and it works fabulously.  I can't to see wait these guys come up
with next!  If you haven't heard these guys yet, then you probably suck.
Suggested tracks:  "I Saw It On Your Keyboard", "Touchdown Turnaround"

2) Red Hot Chili Peppers - Stadium Arcadium (2CD)
I can't believe how much ass these guys still kick.  Anthony's voice
sounds better than ever, and the band is still as tight as a 11 year old
virgin.  And it's a double album to boot!  Suppossedly, the guys moved
back into that old house turned recording studio made famous after Blood
Sugar Sex Magic to record this, and it shows.  Great as always.
Suggested tracks:  "Torture Me", "C'mon Girl", "Tell Me Baby", "21st
Century"

3) Christina Aguilera - Back To Basics (2CD)
What the hell is Christina Aguilera doing in my top 10?!  She released an
amazing album this year, that's why!  Stripped down, dirty, and raw jazz,
funk, and soul.  If the female jazz greats rose from the dead and walked
into a modern studio to record a record, this is what it would sound
like.  Do NOT be ashamed buying or downloading this album, there is no
reason to be.
Suggested tracks:  "Makes Me Wanna Pray", "F.U.S.S.", "Candyman", "I Got
Trouble"

4) Cold War Kids - Robbers & Cowards
This indie-style album stands above the rest this year by simply being
about great songwriting.  Backed by jangly guitars, noisy guitars, and a
very thick piano, this band has the sound of what R.E.M. could have been
if Michael Stipe didn't suck and start giving money to the Democratic
Party and whining about whothefuckcares.  These guys can seriously groove.
Suggested tracks:  "We Used To Vacation", "Passing The Hat"

5) Arctic Monkeys - Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not
These guys got a shitload of recognition this year, and rightly so.  They
were hip, then they weren't, then they were hip again.  Why?  Because
they're just that damn good.  This album is Britain's answer to last
year's Franz Ferdinand's "You Could Have It So Much Better", and it's a
good answer.  Much more raw, gritty, and punk than Franz, these guys have
carved out a niche somewhere between James Brown (RIP), Sex Pistols, and
The Ramones.
Suggested tracks:  "I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor", "Red Light
Indicates Doors are Secured"

6) The Wood Brothers - Ways Not To Lose
Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin, & Wood fame) and his brother Oliver
reunited this year and released this impeccable album of roots & acoustic
blues.  Oliver handles the guitars (steel and otherwise), and Chris
hammers out deep acoustic bass lines that will blow your fucking
speakers.  Seriously.  This album was released on the famed Blue Note
Records, and is so damn raw, yet so extremely powerful, that it is a must
have.
Suggested tracks:  "One More Day", "Luckiest Man", "Atlas"

7) Woldmother - Wolfmother
Back during Jimmy Carter's socialist anti-Semitic policies and oil crisis,
there was a small highlight, and it was the birth of what would eventually
be called "heavy metal".  Some would argue that it started in the 60s with
Steppenwolf, Deep Purple, and Cream, but the style really came into it's
own with Black Sabbath, Mountain, and Led Zeppelin II, and these guys
sound like all of them!  They have enjoyed some recognition this year,
being featured in a couple commercials as well as Tony Hawk's Project 8.
Check this album out, it's pretty damn cool.
Suggested tracks:  "Woman", "Love Train"

8) Family Force 5 - Business Up Front, Party In The Back
This band stuck hard to their faith this year, and turned down multiple
secular record labels, until finding a compromise with Maverick Records
and a distribution deal with Gotee Records (started by tobyMac of DC Talk
fame.)  I'm glad they did, because the album is slammin'.  Some may
compare them to Linkin Park or Korn, but their faith takes them to a level
above and beyond any secular nu-metal/hip-hop rock band that just sings
about underage girls and retarded shit.  I'd almost consider them a male
version of Superchic[k].  Christian or otherwise, I recommend this album
to anybody wanting to hear some heavy party rock done proper.
Suggested tracks:  "Numb", "Peachy",

9) Yellowcard - Lights & Sounds
Yellowcard sticks to what they know best here, and doesn't fall into the
typical play-it-safe pop formula that they could have done so easily.
Wonderful songwriting, an epic feel, and an emotional delivery that shows
the band has matured nicely.
Suggested tracks:  "Sure Thing Falling", "City Of Devils"

10)  Slayer - Christ Illusion
Dude, it's Slayer.
Suggested tracks:  all of them, it's SLAYER.



Honorable Mentions:
Smile Empty Soul - Vultures
The Outline - You Smash It We'll Build Around It
The Killers - Sam's Town
My Chemical Romance - The Black Parade
Daughtry - Daughtry
John Mayer - Continuum

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} NYE

The annual Chinatown Inn party has been unbelievable for the past six years, 
and this one is going to top them all.

Click the link for flyer details, but the jist of it is: Two floors of 
slamming tunes, full spread of food, hundreds of people, the best sound 
system in Pittsburgh, countdown, champagne for everyone, visual surprises, 
and the party goes long into the a.m.

<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sounds better than ever, and the band is still as tight as a 11<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; year old<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virgin.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&#39;s a double album to boot!&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppossedly, the guys<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moved<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back into that old house turned recording studio made famous after
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugar Sex Magic to record this, and it shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great as always.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggested tracks:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Torture Me&quot;, &quot;C&#39;mon Girl&quot;, &quot;Tell Me Baby&quot;, &quot;21st<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Century&quot;
<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Christina Aguilera - Back To Basics (2CD)<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the hell is Christina Aguilera doing in my top 10?!&nbsp;&nbsp;She<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released an<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amazing album this year, that&#39;s why!&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped down, dirty, and
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; raw jazz,<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; funk, and soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the female jazz greats rose from the dead and<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walked<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into a modern studio to record a record, this is what it would sound<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do NOT be ashamed buying or downloading this album, there

<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This indie-style album stands above the rest this year by simply<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about great songwriting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Backed by jangly guitars, noisy guitars,<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very thick piano, this band has the sound of what 
R.E.M. could<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if Michael Stipe didn&#39;t suck and start giving money to the Democratic<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Party and whining about whothefuckcares.&nbsp;&nbsp;These guys can seriously<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; groove.<br>

<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so.&nbsp;&nbsp;They<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were hip, then they weren&#39;t, then they were hip again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they&#39;re just that damn good.&nbsp;&nbsp;This album is Britain&#39;s answer to last<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; year&#39;s Franz Ferdinand&#39;s &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot;, and
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it&#39;s a<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much more raw, gritty, and punk than Franz, these<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guys have<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carved out a niche somewhere between James Brown (RIP), Sex<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pistols, and<br>

<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin, &amp; Wood fame) and his brother Oliver<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reunited this year and released this impeccable album of roots &amp;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acoustic<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver handles the guitars (steel and otherwise), and Chris
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hammers out deep acoustic bass lines that will blow your fucking<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;This album was released on the famed Blue Note<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Records, and is so damn raw, yet so extremely powerful, that it is
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a must<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggested tracks:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One More Day&quot;, &quot;Luckiest Man&quot;, &quot;Atlas&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7) Woldmother - Wolfmother<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back during Jimmy Carter&#39;s socialist anti-Semitic policies and oil
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crisis,<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there was a small highlight, and it was the birth of what would<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eventually<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be called &quot;heavy metal&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some would argue that it started in the<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60s with
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steppenwolf, Deep Purple, and Cream, but the style really came<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into it&#39;s<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own with Black Sabbath, Mountain, and Led Zeppelin II, and these guys<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound like all of them!&nbsp;&nbsp;They have enjoyed some recognition this

<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8) Family Force 5 - Business Up Front, Party In The Back<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This band stuck hard to their faith this year, and turned down<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; secular record labels, until finding a compromise with Maverick
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Records<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a distribution deal with Gotee Records (started by tobyMac of<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC Talk<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fame.)&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m glad they did, because the album is slammin&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compare them to Linkin Park or Korn, but their faith takes them to
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a level<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above and beyond any secular nu-metal/hip-hop rock band that just<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sings<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about underage girls and retarded shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;d almost consider them<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a male<br>

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Entropy's top 10 albums for 2006

<<hellogoodbye>>

i can't speak for the whole album, but the one single they had ("here
in your arms") was way too damn infectious...it's like The Postal
Service if Ben Gibbard took a handful of Zoloft and went to southern
california.

thanks for the reminder. must go get this.

<<2) Red Hot Chili Peppers - Stadium Arcadium>>

i must be the only person i know who didn't like this album. it's not
that it was "bad" per se, and you're right, they do sound good, but it
sounds like two full cd's of the same...damn...song!!

to me there was a reason that there haven't been anymore singles that
have done well from this album - once you've heard "dani california"
(mid-tempo) and "tell me baby" (uptempo), you've heard the entire
freakin' album.

i think they're great, and i'm not typically one of those who pulls
the "i liked them better when nobody knew them" card, but at least in
the Mother's Milk and even BSSM days, it wasn't 130 minutes of
homogeniety...

<<..of what R.E.M. could have been if Michael Stipe didn't suck and
start giving money to the Democratic Party and whining about
whothefuckcares.>>

Nah, he just got old and rich and lost in his own "art for art's sake" bullshit.

<<6) The Wood Brothers - Ways Not To Lose>>

been wanting to pick this up since i read about it in a magazine back
in may when it was released. reminder # 2 from you.

<<7) Woldmother - Wolfmother>>

haven't heard their album, but i was flipping channels last night, and
hit VH1 Classic showing the UK Music Hall of Fame awards - they did a
cover of an AC/DC song and just about blew me out of my seat.


<<The Killers - Sam's Town>>

Again, I'm the only person I know who didn't dig this album. I liked
"Hot Mess" alot, but this feels like...Bruce Springsteen filtered
through the ears of skinny-tie new wave....I don't know. Maybe I need
to give it another listen.

Digweed's Transitions rocked me.

DJ Hype's Dubplate Killaz 2 was also very good.

Eh, I'd actually need two tickets, plus a ride up there since my car's in
need of repairs. I don't think Toronto's going to happen for me. :/

You have a point, but that 'one song' is damn good!  ;)

I put this at 2, because I know for me anyway, it has staying power.

It's basically an extension of Hot Fuss...maybe a bit more mature.

Subject: {pb-cle} Saddam's final statement

His execution happened a little while ago. This was his final statement to
the world:


"To the great nation, to the people of our country, and humanity,

Many of you have known the writer of this letter to be faithful, honest,
caring for others, wise, of sound judgment, just, decisive, careful with
the wealth of the people and the state ... and that his heart is big
enough to embrace all without discrimination.

You have known your brother and leader very well and he never bowed to the
despots and, in accordance with the wishes of those who loved him,
remained a sword and a banner.

This is how you want your brother, son or leader to be ... and those who
will lead you (in the future) should have the same qualifications.

Here, I offer my soul to God as a sacrifice, and if He wants, He will send
it to heaven with the martyrs, or, He will postpone that ... so let us be
patient and depend on Him against the unjust nations.

Remember that God has enabled you to become an example of love,
forgiveness and brotherly coexistence ...

I call on you not to hate because hate does not leave a space for a person
to be fair and it makes you blind and closes all doors of thinking and
keeps away one from balanced thinking and making the right choice ...

I also call on you not to hate the peoples of the other countries that
attacked us and differentiate between the decision-makers and people ...

Anyone who repents - whether in Iraq or abroad - you must forgive him ...

You should know that among the aggressors, there are people who support
your struggle against the invaders, and some of them volunteered for the
legal defense of prisoners, including Saddam Hussein ...

Some of these people wept profusely when they said goodbye to me ...

Dear faithful people, I say goodbye to you, but I will be with the
merciful God who helps those who take refuge in him and who will never
disappoint any faithful, honest believer ... God is Great ... God is great
... Long live our nation ... Long live our great struggling people ...
Long live Iraq, long live Iraq ... Long live Palestine ... Long live jihad
and the mujahideen.

Saddam Hussein

President and Commander in Chief of the Iraqi Mujahid Armed Forces

Additional clarification note:

I have written this letter because the lawyers told me that the so-called
criminal court - established and named by the invaders - will allow the
so-called defendants the chance for a last word. But that court and its
chief judge did not give us the chance to say a word, and issued its
verdict without explanation and read out the sentence - dictated by the
invaders - without presenting the evidence. I wanted the people to know
this."

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saddam's final statement

Is it just me that finds this whole "trial" fishy?  First for how many
months did we not here anything about sadam and if we even did still
have him custody.  Then all of a sudden he's gone to "trial" found
guilty, appeals denied, and "executed".  Reason for the "s is because
the U.S. handed him over to iraqi government to handle the actual
execution--the US didn't actually execute him, Iraqi did.  And there
were no american witnesses to the hanging.  Some official from Iraq said
"ok, he's executed" and that's that.  So who's to say they "said" they
killed him and actually just put him in a witness protection program?
If you REALLY want to get paranoid, what if the US put him in that
witness protection program, and told him to lay low until the next
president takes office?

Now I know why there are so many conspiracy theories, it's fun making up
stories.

Thankfully, the majority of people are stupid and easily controllable.  This
is why a few are able to govern the masses.

Why does nobody remember that Flight 93 was confirmed to have landed at
Cleveland-Hopkins Airport and evacuated on the morning of September 11th,
2001?  I was sitting in school watching my local news stations which were
showing live coverage at the time.  This is better explained in this
conspiracy theory documentary, Loose Change 2:
http://www.torrentspy.com/download.asp?id=506503

It's obvious the entire trial was a sham.  Saddam's execution was imminent,
however, because it was the United States that invaded Iraq.  If it would
have been, Germany, however, things would have proceeded in a much more
civilized fashion.
