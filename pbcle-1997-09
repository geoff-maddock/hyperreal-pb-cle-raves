couldnt get out of and delayed us leaving johns house and made us late and
missed 808 state .....  grrrrrrr.
i think everyone was there to hear (mr. whiner) moby,,,, he was plagued
with technical problems and kept stopping songs because this that or the
other was wrong, not to mention they were the same songs he always plays at
his shows...... dont get me wrong, i like his stuff, but i've seen it all
before and where was alot of the new material?  hrmph.....  he apologized
about 10 times for the problems, and oddly the crowd didn't care...?

Hey everyone, 

I managed to catch the Big Top tour last Friday (August 29th) in
Cleveland and wanted to offer my review.  

The concert (and it was a "concert") was actually much better than I
expected it would be.  It took place at Nautica, with a second, indoor
stage on the third floor of one of the restaurants inside the Powerhouse.
Usually, I hate Nautica shows, but it was kind of refreshing to be
outdoors, especially with that great view of downtown Cleveland all aglow
at night, drapped in the background. 

I arrived at about 9:30 and caught all of 808 State.  Now, these guys were
major league hot in the early 90's, but things have definitely changed.  I
still enjoy them to an extent, but they were trying to do something with
guitars and techno that simply didn't work.  You might say that they were
in a State of transition, and frankly, I would have appreciated the 808
instead of the drums.  Yes, something was missing, and the crowd was *not*
into it.

Banco de Gaia, the next act on the main stage, really did something
special.  Although not into the more ambient sound of things, I certainly
appreciated the visuals and the overall effect.  The concrete cage that is
Nautica, though, was not the correct setting for this group.  They would
have worked out much better at a Blossom or even the Cleveland Hts. Cain
Park amphitheater, you know, somewhere in the middle of a grassy field. 

In between these acts, I headed into the second room for a different
perspective.  The vibe of this second stage was right on.  The room was
barely able to fit a hundred (if that) and the dance floor was on top of
the stage.  All the acts and dj's were within reaching distance.  The
dance floor was wooden, dusty, very small and had a railing on the rear
(with a two story drop).  It was kind of like being inside a basement,
except we were on the third floor.

Anyway, this was a much more intimate environment, and the thought of
greeting Joey Beltram, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson here was mind
blowing.  I imagined being in Detroit in 1988 or something, when it was
all just getting started.

The first act I caught in the second room was Medicine Drum.  They used
congas and machines.  It worked for me and really got the crowd dancing. 
Headrillaz were very hot too.  This trio from England played guitar
techno, but unlike 808 State's version, they found a way to make it feel
right.  The dancers were jumping up and down and begging for more.  Even
the keyboardist was moving around on the stage, carrying his synth with
him on a strap.  Being hard techno with elements of trip hop, I suppose it
allowed the electric guitar a little more freedom to enter into things. 

In many respects, up to this point I figured that Big Top was nothing more
than an experiment to see how guitars, drums and lyrics could be used to
make techno.  But then BT hit the main stage . . .

Brian's performance was maybe the high point of the evening for me.  The
lights were cool, the trance was right on and his enthusiasm was
contagious.  I had a chance to meet him before and after, and he's also a
very likeable person.  BT plays all of his own instruments and this is
impressive too.

Moby, the next main stage act, was not what I expected.  He really came
across as a prima donna mad man.  There was no reason to keep stopping his
songs as he did on several occasions (can you imagine, stopping a song
midway because he didn't happen to like the sound).  It sounded fine. 
Breaking the flow like that is not conducive to anything but later
criticism.  He was the headliner and the second stage closed down for his
performance, but it just didn't do it for me.  My friends and others I
talked to later that night echoed the same sentiment.

When it finally hit me that Joey Beltram and Derrick May were no shows, I
was a little down.  I had so looked forward to them, and having Juan
Atkins drop out a few days earlier, it meant that the event was missing a
very important sound.  It just wasn't balanced.  Speaking of missing
representatives, actually, other than Mike Philly's fine djing,
jungle/drum and base would have also been left out of the line up.

Kevin Saunderson did play, but get this, they had him come on during a
sound check!  Three tracks and during the fourth, they cut him off half
way.  I would later find out that this was partly due to Kevin's
tardiness.  He missed his set starting time, and with a concert unlike a
rave, you have to be on time or else you don't play.  But still, I had to
laugh when I was among five or ten other people dancing to him -- Kevin
Saunderson -- while the crew set up for Moby.  Heck, I bet no one even
knew what they were hearing or who was spinning it.  This guy performs for
tens of thousands in Europe.  His name alone can make a party happen.  I
bet when he was 15 he had more people dance to his sets than at Big Top.
Anyway, it was pretty ironic . . . and sad.

Right before Eat Static, there was a phenomenal set of hard acid trance.
I wasn't able to get the dj's name and didn't recognize his face, but it
rocked.  Again, the audience seemed to have no clue.  They were definitely
a non-rave crowd for the most part because they only seemed to be
interested in the main acts and not the great music in between the acts
spun by quality dj's.  At one point, I was the only one dancing to this
excellent acid trance.  I suppose the audience assumed that it was just
background music (like at a rock concert).  

Eat Static was really amazing.  I love Goa Trance, so I enjoyed it.  But
there were many others not familiar with this music who also got into it.
The crowd was most likely between 400 and 500 at the highest point (I
might be overestimating, actually), and fewer than 125 stayed until the
end.  But those who did were rewarded for sure.  Eat Static's visuals were
hypnotic.  They had plenty of swirling, psychedelic lights displayed on a
huge brain they had dragged out on stage.  I kept thinking of the Orb's
"A Huge Pulsating Brain" track.  Then there was this actress who walked
around on stilts like a futuristic, mechanical monkey.  She even had a
tail.  It was weird, but the music was superb.

Well, I had a fine time.  I met Trout and Titonton from the pb-cle list
for the first time as well as a few others.

If the turn out in other cities was like that in Cleveland and Chicago
(650 in Chitown), one thing is for sure -- this was a big financial loser. 
I'm a little shocked that the attendance was so poor in Cleveland, but
then again, it was $30 -- an outrageous price to pay, and there was
another party that night in Euphoria.  My fear is that the promoters and
music companies who are paying attention to this test balloon are going to
pull the plug on techno altogether based on the poor response in ticket
sales.  We might just end up seeing the MTV buzz clips return to the
post-grunge sounds of 1995 again.

Braden

yo.. whats up kids :)


in case you hadnt heard, the cmj happening this week, im going to post the
entire list of dance-music realted events, but in case u wanna check it
yourself, go to www.cmj.com


if anybody would like to go up to this event, please let me know ASAP...i
am planning on travelling by bus, but if you want, i cant rent a car and we
can split the cost...(cost of a car rental from thurs-sun is about $70 with
my employee discount :)


i have to leave no later than mid-afternoon thursday -- im mcing at the party
at the cooler on thurs. nite (check out that lineup! :), and i would like to
be back in pgh sun nite, whenever really, as long as i can drag myself to
work on monday :)


so PLEASE if you are SERIOUS about going and wont flake out on me, write me
back...btw, you'll be on your own while in the city, so try and make
sleeping arrangements...however, all car expenses will be split at least in
half (i may kick in quite a bit more than that, depending on how things
work out :) and ask anyone who has travelled with me, im a good
companion...are you? :)

and while i dont know for sure *at this moment* i may be able to get u into
one or two of these parties for free...:)


ok, so now that ive come off sounding like a tyranical dictator, let me
drop the lineups on you...u can email me at hossam@topsecret.net (or just
hit "reply" in your mail, its all the same)...or if u are in the pgh area, u
can call me at 412.544.6533 and if im not in, leave a msg on my voicemail...


again, i need to know as sson as possible :) thanks alot :)


peace,
hossam

I just wanted to update you on the final line up for Psych O Delia,
happening this Saturday night in Erie, PA.

The Jungle/House Room: 

In addition to Ruffian (Jungle/Pittsburgh), Eric D (Jungle/Pittsburgh),
Adair (Jungle/Pittsburgh), Joe Kidd (House/Akron), Rob Morley
(House/Rochester), and Sean Michaels (House/Rochester), Smartie
(Jungle/Pittsburgh) and a House dj from Toronto have been added to the
line up.

The Trance Room: 

Nivoc from Paris, France has offered to extend his set to five hours.  If
you don't yet know the name "Nivoc", it's probably because he has never
agreed to play before in the U.S.  In Europe, he is considered one of the
top 5 Goa/Psychedelic Trance dj's of all time.  If you look at virtually
any mix cd of Goa Trance, you'll see Nivoc listed.  Spectrada (Toronto)
and Skywalker (Buffalo) will also throw down some hypnotic tracks in the
Chamber of Trance. 

Visuals:

The lighting effects will include psychedelic fractal images displayed
on screens, plenty of black lights, spots, colored beams, strobes and
everything else you would expect.

Price:

$10 before 11 P.M. and only $12 after.  The party goes until at least 8:00
A.M. with the strong possibility of an open tables after party.

More Info:

For the location of the event, call (814) 825-0351 on Saturday starting in
the late afternoon.  The party will be somewhere in downtown Erie in a
secure location.  With Erie parties, as everyone who has ever gone to one
already knows, it's always a great time -- a very free and open
atmosphere.

Remember, Erie is only 1.5 hours from Cleveland.  In terms of driving
time, it's closer than Canton.  Pittsburgh is even closer!

Peace,

Braden

to argue little one why the warning not to flame???.
i know you can't resist pumping out page after page of ignorant
drivel...but try not to use false posturing to avoid the spanking you
deserve, son

hey... 

it is about time that i contributed to the R-O-M, so below is the flyer
for DYNAMO. i'm pretty psyched, mainly because i will get to hear tik tak
and kevin cunningham (with their insane 3 turntablistic skillz) again,
but also 'cause of simply jeff. boo williams didn't impress me all that
much @ delphi - i think i'm just not a fan of chicago house, but that
don't mean that he won't tear it up with his insanly fat self :)

haha fooled you. no free sex. ALTHOUGH... i have found a new low price
on 1200s in case anybody is buying some (i'm <<almost>> there myself):

$399 each at Radar City Electronics in NYC
http://electronics.net/RadarCity/index.html (in the Home Audio Decks
section) 718.897.1000

geminis are bad, never never buy them! i spun on some last nite at a
house party. the motors are weak + the whole thing must be built out
of plastic, since if you barely touch the record, the speed will go
about 10 BPM up or down.

today is the boringest birthday i ever had. although i did find a
couple of 1989-cheese-booty-house-type records ;] on sale in kent & a
james christian cd. i got 3 presents that are money which will at
least contribute a little to my turntable fund, but i miss the element
of surprise...

Hey everyone-
	Glad to see lots of you back from summer break. =) Just thought we
drop you a line to let you know about the rave flyer trading web page we
put up about a month ago.  There is about 20 people that trade flyers on
the page and you can add yourself to the list!  So...if there is a flyer
you have been looking for OR you just want to trade a ton of 'em check out
the page and add your name and postal address.  We think anyone on there
would be happy to trade with you.  
	The address is listed below...enjoy!
Love-
Matt & Nicole

One the subject I tables I had to spin on the new Gemini 1000s (or
something like that). I'd heard that they were close to 1200s, but found
them terrible and only barely better than the Gemini 1800 belt drive
tables I started out with. Every time I back cued they skipped (much less
trying to scratch). The motor responded to pitch changes decently (it
didn't lag like other Geminis) and was stronger than other Geminis I've
used, but still wasn't strong enough to get the record up to speed when
you let it go. The platter would almost stop when I stopped the record and
would spin backwards when I was rewinding. 
I think there's another new Gemini model of tables above this one, I have
nothing to say about those since I haven't used them, but avoid the 1000s
at all costs!
Eric

Just thought I'd let you kids know that my radio show:

The Cut-Ups Method

is now on Sunday Nights, 11pm till the wee hours of the morning 

Its on WPTS 92.1 FM, in Pittsburgh, sure its a bitch to pick up, but I
promise to make it worth your while.

I play mostly jungle, dark, hard, bouncy b-line stuff & experimental
breaks, and gabber <rotterdam, and more evil high-bpm stuff>, 
occasionally some happy hardcore, and a bit of noise here and there...

All around, I like to make it fun. 

Give me a call if you listen @ 648-7989

l8s,

I've heard similar stuff about geminis in the past, but I've never found
them to be as bad as people seem to make them out to be (at least the
direct drive model).  

Does anyone have a suggestion for tables with comparable performance to
Technique 1200's that are cheaper (maybe just because of name
recognition).  I'v never heard of any, but thought I'd ask.  I'm in the
market for some turntables, but only realistically spend $400-$500.
(preferably less than that).  I'm also looking into buying gear to start
producting, but I'm still researching that end of things.

You'll hear it a thousand times, but go with the Technics.  The Gemini
direct drives feel like a toy while the 1200s are very solid.  If you
can only spend 400-500 then just buy one technic now and another later. 
That's what I did many years ago.  I actually bought a Gemini direct
drive package when I started out and sent it back after a week!  I
exchanged it for one 1210.
    I've seen some other turntables that have some cool features like a
bigger pitch adjust range and BPM counters (you shouldn't use one), but
these tables were as much as as 1200 or even more.  They weren't as
solid either.

first of all, we all have the right to question why an event should cost
$20.  nowadays it seems that $20 is the regular amount, no matter what the
city, and some of us (i for one) are sick of getting reamed for mediocre
offerings. 

however, before anyone complains about this event in particular, it would
useful for you to know that their event early this summer (A HARD BLACK
EVENING, jun 21) featured a lineup almost as stellar as REVOLUTION, and
was only $12.  it was worth $12 for sure, in fact if you look in the
archives, my glowing review of HARD BLACK EVENING qualifies it to be the
BEST event i have attended so far in 1997, bar none. 

i'm not guaranteeing that this event will be as good, it may end up a bit
too big and chaotic for my tastes, but all i know is that the black nation
cru represents a simple, honest ideal: to promote the best in hard techno
to the world, through the work of locally-based artists or
conceptually-similar artists, wherever they may be found.  they're doing
it by watching out for their own, staying true to themselves, and in the
process, have brought us some of the purest expressions of hard techno
that the world has ever seen. 

and lest you think their politics are "casual," i assure you that--while
perhaps not on the same level of intensity as detroit's underground
resistance or london's praxis--black nation is some deadly serious shit
indeed.  and if you think it's about being black, well, that's only part
of the equation.

so yes, this event will be decidedly lopsided in terms of its relentless
hard techno assault, but they never promised anything but.  to paraphrase
from my review of their earlier event, this event is intended to burn the
genetic code of hard techno into your brain and into your being.  if this
is what you seek, then join THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTION.  i know i will.

I have to agree..I just got ahold of a pair of gemini DD50's, and 
they don't seem as bad as everybody says.. Granted, I've only played 
with 1200's once or twice, but I'm not having that much trouble with 
the gemini's, you just have to give the record a very slight 'push' 
when letting go...

Laurent Garnier is playing at a PLASTIKPRODUCT (Plus 8) TRIP 4 party tonight in
Windsor, Ontario. It's 9pm-4am, for only $10 US ($14 CAN).

I'm planning on going there later this evening. If anyone from the Cleveland
area is up for it, please e-mail me, or call (216) 397-5310. It's less than 2.5
hour drive, so it shouldn't be bad at all.

Thanks,

~megan/saltshaker.

There will be an After Party thrown by Double N Productions
call this number 412.734.8424 to find out about that

PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS
This party should be really interesting cuz its been promoted
on a high end level for pittsburgh and is relying on the vibe on promotion
less than the reputation of the lineup.
like new faces and new styles of people
were somewhat interested in this production..pitt students,
duquesne students, etc. (i.e. this wont be a party full of babies)
I know the promoter is bustin there butt and
expecting to lose money (which i hope she doesnt),
so im supporting this event %100

BE SAFE KIDS AND
JUST SAY KNOW
.::Know what you are taking
.::Know what is illegal
.::Know what is evil to your mission
.::Know what to do if things get loopy

and by all means....

have a blast   [o-=-o]
dumbass


*does a backflip*


please forward to anyone interested...

sincerely Peter Pan the crazy man

psych o delia - kickin-ass 90%-trance main room, more parties need this
sort of thing rather than the usual house that seems to be everywhere.
lots of fun all in all, PLEEEEEEEEEZEEEEEE THROW MORE OF THESE!!!!

deep.  who the hell made the direx?  they need shot.  i ended up finding
the place from an operator at 411 !!!!  christ.
what was up with the neo-nazi-skin-head-state-pooper at the door? and the
full body cavity search?  now i remember why i dont frequent pgh parties.
the music was alright when i first got there, it was our former ygn dj
trevor playing what he always does.  hmmm, youngstown trevor, remember
that?  nevermind.
then it was housey stuff, no comment, and the mic.  why?  *sigh*
jordan was really good. spacey nice stuff and it trailed off til 8 when i
left.
ymmv,
trouty.

I really feel sorry for everyone who did  not get a chance to go up to Windsor
to see Laurent Garnier at the Plus 8 party on Friday night.

Only one word to desribe it: OUTSTANDING.

He played for the whole 6 hours while I was there (10 pm - 4 am which was
closing time). Based on the quality of the performance, I wouldn't have felt
bad dishing out $20-25 dollars, rather than the $10 that they charged. I even
had the pleasure to have Richie Hawtin collect my money and Matthew Hawtin
stamp my hand.

The club  setting (LOOP) in downtown Windsor was quite fun. A very dark and
full of fog dance floor (it took me half an hour to figure out where the DJ is
set), a nice chill-out area with couches, and the regular pool table hang out
area in the middle.

The sound system was unbeliavable. Over 40,000 Watts of extremely clear sound
over the whole frequency spectrum. 

Laurent started the set with slow disco-house/funk. After about 30 min he went
into really uncharted teritories. The 2 hour
minimal techno block was just OUT THERE. It was so deep, slow, and reaching
into nothing-ness that it's almost hard to describe. 
>From there it went even further. 2 hours of hard (and I really mean HARD)
techno that had everyone's ears ringing.

To top it all off, he finished the night with glass shattering drum 'n' bass
(Photek style mostly), that is something that is almost never heard at parties.
Even Richie Hawtin danced to this !?!?!?

All in all, a great experince to see one of the best DJ's offer his full range
of talent.

I also saw an EMPIRE flyer there. Someone mentioned that party on the list last
week. Lots of people there were talking about it, and it seems like there's
going to be a big Windsor/Detroit contingent going up to Toronto on Sept 27the.
The party is really cheap (only $14 for advance tickets), and the line up
sounds great. Matthew Hawtin was actually passing the flyers, which means that
it must be a quality event if the Hawtins are endorsing it.

Anyone from this area planning on going? I heard that the Buffalo and Rochester
pre-sale tickets have been sold out, and the flyer mentions that there are some
for sale in Erie (?!!?!) as well. I want to go, since it seems like the
Canadian parties are lots of fun and quality music at the same time.

Anyway, I must go now. 
Stay well, and have a beautiful day.
~megan/saltshaker.

Hey all... *hugs*  This is pretty much a "i'm really tired but not really
because i'm really hyper and i was just thinking all this stuff and wanted to
share it with people" post... so bear with me... ;P  ;)  *smiles*
 
First off, I'm like freezing because my air conditioner's been on high, well,
kinda, for a while and my hands are like, not thawed out yet, so if there'a 
bunch of typos, well, nyah.  ;P  ;)  heh.  But anyway... I was looking
through all these photo albums that I have... those of you who know me know
how many pictures I used to take... and how many I'd *like* to take, but
being that promoters are like, well, wierd now, I can't get into parties with
my camera anymore... you all know how I'm like, an undercover newsreporter
like trying to destroy the scene, of course... ;P  :P  
 
Anyway... (again)... I just, well, wanted to let everyone know how much they
mean to me... like, I dunno... that sounds really dork, and well, it's all
good because I *am* a dork, but seriously... when it comes right down to it,
the whole "party" thing is about friends... not about being in a scene, not
about this or that, or who you know or whatever... and yeah, this has all
been said before, and it's all monotonous, but like, sometimes things need to
be repeated... 
 
I'm looking through my pictures of everyone I care about and all these people
that I only met for an instant but that will be in my mind for the rest of
eternity because they were so nice... my Vibration pictures being some of the
most important I have... I met people there for the first time that would
soon have a larger part in my life than I could ever imagine... meeting the
12B crew for the first time... pictures of the bus trip that Frank and I did
together for all the Pittsburgh peeps... meeting Craig for the first time
(even though I thought he was gonna kick my bootay ;), meeting the Delaware
crew (I learned about "ballchains" off of Dan Deliverance...heh), and I have
the two best pictures of Nicole and Lori from that party... and a picture of
the busload of people after the party... heh.  ;) 
 
My Mosaic pictures... *happy sigh*  SO awesome... where I met even *more*
people for the first time... and where I first realized that people traveled
from SO far away for parties... I met people from NC and SC... the awesome
picture of Liz taking a picture of me as I took a picture of her... ;)  a
pic of *everyone* facing the dj and movin' to the beat... not a frown on
*ANYONE's* face... and still, when I look through some of these pictures, I
notice people that I didn't know before but know now... :)  I actually found
a picture of gator from that party and I didn't even know who he was at the
time... *sigh*  Love ya, Mikey.  
 
I have pictures from Lost City... gotta pic here of me and Douggie, who is
probably pissed at me right now... *sigh* because I've been afraid to call
him 'cause I couldn't come down to visit... if you're reading this, happy
late b-day, boy.  *massive.huggles*  I also have the best picture of a few
peeps rollin'... heh.  :)  and the biggest disco ball you'll ever see... ;P
 
and Mars... awesome party... :)  it's so wierd to see some of the people in
here because I hardly ever see them at parties anymore... Jamesc, Velure
(using glowsticks, nonetheless! ;P), Formica, MINA MINA RAH RAH RAH!  *!*,
*sigh* another pic of gator... he was so happy.  :)  Dr Jesus!, but fear of
the people in the middle of the dance floor at Mars making out... :/  
And the afterparty where I heard Craig spin for the second time and I went
insane and I met Caz for the first time... werd... :)  But fear of the drive
home.. SYRACUSE... *!*  
 
Sunrise Festival... *another happy sigh*  Such a wonderful party... even if I
was accused of being a narc... ;P  it's all good, though.  I think I have
some of the best pictures ever from that party... :)  Shadow and his g/f as
the sun rises behind them... :)  Dan and Andrea smiling their faces off...
Scott Spinning his sunrise set... Eddie Twizzler kneeling and getting energy
to dance in a bit... a group picture with Erin, Caz, Poot, Douggie, Jenn,
Jamesc, Kittyn, Sunnye, Gator, Jammin James, and Joanna... Caz and the kitty
he found, Piper and Eddie, Sasha, Chris Green after the party being as clean
as he was when he got there... (jerk!  *jealous ;)... )... and people dancing
as the party ended... 
 
And my yahoo pix... which are up on est's page... 
 
*sigh*  I dunno... who knows who read this far... but, well, I hate to say it
(AGAIN), but I miss the "good ole' days"... and yeah, I know, I know... I
gotta make these days as good as the ole' days... even if they weren't all
that far behind me, and yadda yadda yadda... I dunno.  I'm homesick and it's
3 in the morning and I don't wanna wake up for work tomorrow, so I'm
rambling... and I'm cold.  Oh!  I also have my Ritual pix in front of me...
:)  Carey and Hugh... so cute... :)  Helen and Dan and Polmah and Jenn... SO
cute... :)  a picture of Liz and I... a picture of Brian Feeley and Polmah
and Chris Green and Liz... *LOL*  It's so awesome... :)  a rad ass picture of
Baconboy and Nicole... and a super picture of JT and Jenn... :) :) 
 
I dunno... as you can see, I have no point to this post, really... except to
let all my friends out there... the ones that I see daily, and the ones that
I see once a year... that I love you all... and that *you* are what raving is
all about to me... when I go to a party, I go for 3 reasons... to do E, to
trip, and to speed... *lol*  I'm KIDDING!  But seriously, I go to listen to
good music, I go to dance, and I go to see my friends... if one of those
aspects is missing, then I have a bad time.  That simple.  I mean, yeah, it's
cool if I go to a party and there's good music and I can dance, but if
there's nobody I know there, then, well, I feel a little wierd... like, out
of place... I dunno... I can't explain, nor do I feel like going into it
right now, but I'm sure some of you know what I mean... 
 
ANyway, I kinda miss the way things were a while ago... even a year ago...
especially like, fear of people making fun of candy ravers... if you got into
this scene for the "right" reasons (whatever, argue with me on that if you
want, you should already know what they are), then you were a candy raver
once, too... there's so not a reason to make fun of them... I LOVE seeing
people all dressed up in coolie clothes, glitter, and candy, and the
whistles, and whatever else... especially stickers... if I had to count all
the stickers I've saved from people that gave them to me at parties, well,
I'd be here for a while... :)  It just makes me happy... it's just another
little perk to my memories.  :)  I love that Pez makes fun of candy ravers
when we ALL know that he was such a hardcore one... :)  *lol*  werd...
 
Ack, I was gonna say "anyway" again... ;P  But anyway... ( ;P ), I should
head to bed... to all of you out there, I really do love you all... I mean,
yeah, I know some of you out there think that I'm totally obnoxious and just
utterly the epitome of immaturity, but, well, we're all entitled to our own
opinions.  I just don't see the need to grow up anytime soon.  ;P  
 
Oo.marquis.proby.oO
 
p.s. - on a completely unrelated note, has anyone heard anything about
"think" which apparently is the next, uh, UW armory event?  And where is the
article supposed to appear where Lonnie explains what happens?  i thought it
was supposed to be in retina, but I just got it a few days ago and it wasn't
in there anywhere?  :/ 
 
g'night.  :*

       'Big Top' Like A Techno Trade Show         'Big Top' Like A Techno
Trade Show    September 16, 1997 8:27 AM EDT


   Big Top (National Orange Show, San Bernardino; about 7,500 capacity;
$30 top)


 By Phil Gallo


 HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - The ballyhooed summer of techno, 1997's months-long
coming-out party for electronic dance music, finds its culmination in a
trio of major package tours.


 Best of the lot, Big Top, is top-heavy in established acts that pass
muster on aural and visual levels, most specifically Moby and Loop Guru.
For all its scheduling snafus last week -- location was changed three
times -- the event ran like clockwork.


 The evolution of the all-night rave into its first major traveling
concert festival (San Berdoo was the 10th and final stop) bodes well for
its acceptance as a performing art. Friday's Electric Highway stop at the
same venue, headlined by Geffen act the Crystal Method, attracted about
1/10 of the 5,500 that made it out for Big Top, which was paired with the
planned Nocturnal Wonderland rave -- a sign that the notoriety of the acts
does make a difference to the mass audience. This weekend's Organic, a
reprise of one of last year's highly successful raves, hits Snow Valley
with top 10 act Sneaker Pimps headlining.


 Most significantly, Big Top's audience is a major-level marketing maven's
demographic dream. It's record-buying teens and twentysomethings, youths
with a keen ear turned toward music and an isolated sense of day-glo
fashion and fun that celebrates the extremities of peace, love and
understanding. In effect, they're hippies with a sense of rhythm and
disposable income.


 Big Top split its bill between a hangar-like main stage and a
second-stage building that simultaneously housed live acts and DJs with a
curtain dividing the two -- like going to a trade show in the dark.
Interestingly, the presence of a live act makes little difference; the
dancing and bobbing throng faces the stage at every step of the way, even
if they're just starring at space bare except for some trippy Alice in
Wonderland decorations.


 Obviously, for this music to take off at retail and radio, it needs to
clear the hurdle of the acceptance at the concert level. No dance music
has ever made it out of the underground without becoming a performance
entity -- swing, jazz, disco, country line dancing and on and on made
their headway with acts rather than songs and electronica, which has seen
the biggest push go to Prodigy, will be no different.


 Main stage acts all fit the traditional definition of a band, save for
keyboard-pounding BT, providing a far more visceral experience than the
stage 2 assortment of button twirlers and sound tweakers that can be about
as interesting to watch as a television repair man. Yet no matter which
way you turned, the overwhelming murmur was an electronic throb being
hurtled at 130 beats per minute.


 Moby, by far the biggest seller and best-known of the 20-act lot,
provided the biggest burst of onstage human energy, springing from drum
machines and samplers to congas and timbales while barking out the
occasional lyric. He relies heavily on samples of primo disco beats and a
punk attitude as he tries to create music that fills you with ``joy,''
pumping sampled shouts that land just shy of ``everybody dance now.''
Certainly, Moby's set showed the greatest reliance on rhythms associated
with commercially accepted dance music, his closest rival being
Headrillaz, which infused hip-hop beats and rap into their dance mix.


 Loop Guru's heady broth, heavy on analog percussion and bass, is awash in
Indian accents and remnants of dreamy New Age. They play off the constant
beat with an array of arty effects -- trumpet bleats, brash guitar
chording, scratching from a DJ, operatic howls from their female vocalist
-- and wind up covering the greatest terrain of any Big Top performer.


 Elder statesmen 808 State from Manchester, England, started with a hard
rock edge, evoking images of Led Zeppelin and, rhythmically speaking,
Sympathy for the Devil, before veering into an odd dichotomy of relentless
beats and a whimsical soprano sax. Reprise act BT supplied music that had
little appeal beyond setting up dance textures.


 And therein lies the rub: as exciting as acts such as dream-scapers Banco
de Gaia and Emporium can be, there's going to be a thoroughly uninspired
counterpoint. At one point, the second stage was offering a teeny-bopper
vocal over 180 beats per minute while the other side featured a brutally
harsh beat accented by an annoying squeal every five seconds or so. It's
moments like those that places techno on the same list of sausage and laws
-- you don't want to see these things made.


 Visual effects, when used, were quite exciting. Several DJs' sets were
given an intense lift by the digital equivalent of an oil-water-and-dye
light show as images from three computers and two VCRs were blended into a
explosive mix of color, shapes and b&w film. Others favored Asian footage,
particularly action pics and Godzilla footage.

Let's see....Deep!  My comments are as follows in response to trout and 
spike.  Directions, for me were not a problem, only because the guy I 
went with lived literally about 5 minutes from the roller rink.

As for the roller rink....I was a bit disappointed with the "virgin" 
site.  It was a little to mainstream for me.  I enjoy more underground 
settings.

Lighting was terrible.  Too much color, which led to too much light.  
There was not enough strobe either that night.  Give me a mess of black 
lights and a whole ton of strobe and I'm set.

Spike, I agree, the guy on the mic was terrible and he wouldn't even 
consider passing it because my friend and I tried to lure it away from 
him.  "Random Acts of Kindness....Random Acts of Kindness"  It was simply 
too much of the same thing over and over.

How about that Sheryl Crow mix at the beginning of Paul Johnson's(?) set. I 
was told he is a widely loved dj and don't want to disrespect him in any 
way, but again, a little too commercial for my unconventional tastes.

Overall, I was expecting much more than I got, but I had fun none-the-less.

Later, smooth (XXX)

Drug free is the way to bee!

for METAMORPHOSIS.

this event will go from 11 PM - 7 am.

_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

sat sept 20

METAMORPHOSIS is an event designed to celebrate the coming together of
several columbus promoters including melissa and walt of collective
intelligence, with titonton (haiku) and doughboy (pitch control
productions) of ele_mental. 

the lineup includes an incredibly rare live performance by cleveland's DAN
CURTIN in his first live performance in ohio since 1992.  make sure to see
this because dan's unique, layered brand of experimental techno will not
be heard live here ever again, as he is moving his studio to switzerland! 
also performing live is virginia's hard techno master BRIAN ZENTZ (aka
BARADA). 

DJ sets for the evening include a storming jungle set by J. MAJIK (from
the UK) in his first ohio appearance, smooth soul house from chicago's
GLENN UNDERGROUND, hard house from new york's JAMES CHRISTIAN, detroit
bass by DJ GODFATHER, deep house from detroit's masterful TERRENCE PARKER,
minimal techno from san francisco's SHO, funky breaks from sf's CARLOS,
hip-hop wizardry from DJ SWAMP, morning house from kentucky's TREVOR
LAMONT, and others, including several sets by our own columbus crew. 

pre-sale tickets are now available at culture 7, world record, and avalon
for $18, admission at the door will be $23 (up from $22 due to unforseen
last-minute expenses).  your last chance to purchase $18 pre-sale tickets
will be at the EMERGE pre-party.  pre-sale tickets will still be available
at stores for **$22** the day of the event. 

* * * * * IMPORTANT INFORMATION: PLEASE READ

you are encouraged to purchase pre-sale tickets because capacity at the
space MAY be exceeded early in the evening, so having your pre-sale ticket
and arriving early (before 11 PM) will help guarantee problem-free entry
to the event.  parking capacity may also be exceeded, so again, your best
bet is to get there early.

also keep in mind that in order to safeguard a clean and worry-free event,
alcohol WILL NOT BE PERMITTED.  NO OPEN BOTTLES OF ANY KIND WILL BE
PERMITTED.  you MAY bring water and other beverages as long as they are
NOT OPEN.  

also: there will be NO RE-ENTRY (barring emergencies) until 4 AM.  and

can i just say i had a great time at this one... much better than i
expected to have considering i almost didnt make it... i busted my but
the whole day to find a ride to this spot b/c while i could have taken a
cab, i had no idea where the hell this space was... finally we find this
place and walk in .... but by this time, i was not in a good mood... it
was as if u had to go to the pre-party to know where the hell the actual
event was... anyway.. moving on...

the space was nice, and it was cool how i wasnt totally felt up uppon
walking through the door.. although i did here some of the locals
complain abt the state trooper at the door.. security was
ultra-friendly, i even danced w\ one of the securety guards on patrol...
and i was rolling my face off at the time... i think they went a little
bit overboard w\ the lighting and the myst shit.. it was like hard to
see or whatever... but immagine how i must have felt floating amonst the
clouds... 

i didnt like the music very much... too much house.... but after a
while, when my VIBE was crawling back from the grave, i was actually
able to enjoy some of the shit i heard...


> How about that Sheryl Crow mix at the beginning of Paul Johnson's(?) set.

what was up w\ that shit... its one thing to experiment, and a whole
nother mistake to spin sheryl crow... what exactly was that dude
thinking... ?? i've heard him spin b4.. and was not impressed so i half
expected it... but i'm not sure he was the fool spinning sheryl crow...

moving on...

there is a running joke that i learned of the other night....
apparently.. "pttsburgh parties have a lot of shade" ... well, this was
not what i experienced the other night at deep.. i met some of the
friendliest people, saw others i had chilled w\ b4.. and even saw a
friend from ny.. apparently she had come w\ paul johnson... her name is
Christy she has long blond hair (usually in those small pony tail
things) and i belive she's gay... (everyone know who i'm talking abt
yet??) 
... anyway, i was feeling very loved that evening at deep... i was
giving out hugs and candy, and i got tons of shit back... there was
minimal shade at this event .. thats for sure...

and the best part of all:

i was gonna be streight edge... but i was having such a good time which
i didnt expect to have that i said... fuck it... so this chick... god
bless her and keep her sane... tells me she has some good stuff which
she bought for herself but isnt in the mood to drop... and she said, if
its wacked shit come find me, i will give u your money back... i didnt
really believe her, but i guess a part of me did... it was kind of
admirable i thought... and so i dropped around 2... i was rolling my
face off till nearly 7.. its been a while (over 5 months) since i've
treated myself to shit like that (cant afford it) and so i knew that
even if it was the shadiest kind it would still accomplish something...
this was the best shit i've EVER taken... can i tellu i was floating
amonst the clouds...? just randamly walking around.. i kind of lost my
balance twice and that wasnt very cool.. but i didnt care...

i saw this girl like 12 times that night... and i gave her the biggest
hugs... simply b/c she diserved them... thanks hon.. (i believe here
name is Amy...)

btw... i only mentioned the above b/c it played an important part of my
experience the entire day... such comments are rare,,, enjhoy them while
u can see them.


just in case u may have seen me.. i was one of the dudes w\ a septum, a
diesel messenger-bag, and a striped white polo shirt.. although some
other totally cool dude was also wearing the same one... my pants were
like everyone elses.. increadibly large w\ a piece added or whatever...

shout outs:

Elif... {{hugs}} sweety,,, i saw the stars in your eyes every time i
looked at u.. that was very cool..
el... those lights around your neck were totally cool..
sarrah,,, thanks for your patience..
katie, suzy, and abby... i'm sorry it sucked for u... still, dont go
back to philly.
joel.. i looked for u all night,,, i guess u couldnt make it,...
Dave,, your my boy... thanks for everything... u should have stayed til
the end though...

to anyone i may have forgetten.. and there are quite a few of u.,..
thank u, for showing me that the scene in pitt can be as cool (ie
supper-ultra-friendly\viby) as i'm used to...

all my love and respect,

galve.

Hey guys!

I will be coming to this party, and bringing a little of the vibe from
Kansas City! Can't wait to meet more of you from that part of the
country!
 
The Help! part: I'm flying in Friday night (arriving in Columbus at
10:30 p.m.) and the friend I'm staying with has to work until too late
to go to the pre-party. Anyone out there like to make a new friend
(me!), come pick me up at the airport and take me with you to the
pre-party??? I can help you out with gas money, good karma, whatever.
I'm really quite nice, and friendly. Don't be shy! ;->

Other than that, I'll try to make any net meets at the pre-party (has
one been set up yet?) and the main party, but if any of you see me
during either of the parties, feel free to come up and say "Hi!"
 
I'm pretty easy to spot. I'll have a green Ninja Turtles backpack on or
near me, with a red flashing light on it. You can usually find me near
the front dancing all night! I'm short with short, blond hair and I'll
probably be handing out copies of High-R Frequencies magazine. Come and
ask me for your free copy of our second issue!
 
I just re-subbed to the list after missing a couple weeks so forgive me
if I ask some questions that have already been covered.
 
Does anyone know anything about the space for either the pre-party or
the main party? How long will it take to drive to either place from the
OSU campus? Are all the DJS confirmed? If answers to thes questions are
lingering in the data banks of any of you, pls tell me what's up.
 
Thanks, and see you all on the dance floor!

deep was fun, and the music was good.. jsut not loud enough. the space was
cool as hell, 1000 people and some good vibes if you know how to play them.
Well, like i promised, (do i ever deliver? hehe), it did not "blow up" but
i still had a blast. Deep productions is throwing another gig called
deeper, . . she threw a phat party.. Its really hard to throw an all House
and Breaks Joint and get a huge turnout in pittsburgh, being how
"jungalized" i am i had a hard time dancing to stuff that speed.
at any rate i agree that the directions sort of sucked, and i was pretty
dissappointed in the attendence of the preparty, but what can you expect
for an afternoon thing, i guess, damn nocturnal creatures..

gots to sleep

> How about that Sheryl Crow mix at the beginning of Paul Johnson's(?) set.

what was up w\ that shit... its one thing to experiment, and a whole
nother mistake to spin sheryl crow... what exactly was that dude
thinking... ?? i've heard him spin b4.. thand was not impressed so i half
expected it... but i'm not sure he was e fool spinning sheryl crow...

first of all who the hell are you to call paul a fool? if you don't like house or didn't like his set is one thing, broadcasting your immaturity with shallow remarks like calling someone a fool because you didn't like something they did tears your argument down to just a superficial remark.

just to make a point and to emphasize where this is coming from, over half of yer deep review was about your roll...
                                                        ...whatever.

I don't know bro, isn't all about the opinion?  He could have debated the
choice of a Crow track in a set and why the house genre would be better
complimented with a more underground select.  Then, a Paul fan could
counter point with why the track added to the diversity of the set and
brought a fresh air to the deep vibe.  And we'd be nowhere.  How can you
argue a jockey's choice in terms of right and wrong?  Either you liked it,
or you didn't.  Or you didn't, a lot, and you thought he was a fool.
Cool, nuff said, we know what he thinks.  If somebody thinks otherwise,
they can say so too, and now we know what people thought of Paul - which
is what discussion is all about.  nuff madness,

what was the final word on the rebels?  Aren't they supposed to be at
Metropol tonight?  All ages?

hi everyone! If this is the free party yall are talking about, you wont be
able to have a netmeet at the bathrooms because the bathroom might be a
tree or a pole or a puddle or something... just to make sure and let you
know that this event is a renegade event and will be *outside* sort of like
a house party but in the cuts of an industrial zone which has sort of an
eerie personality.. i love these parties becuz its all about the music and
*spirit* of raving, whatever you think that may entail. i regret having
prior obligations but here are the direx anywayz!

its under the west end bridge (rain or shine),
which means get on
-376 West from downtown pittsburgh
-Take 279 North over a bridge to the northside..
-Take Ohio River Blvd (second lane from left)
-Get off at the Chateau St. exit past Three Rivers Stadium
-Take a left on Beaver Ave and take a right
by the Cardello Building which is North Point Drive
and youre facing the spot under the bridge,
park on the street or in the lot to the right.

hope some of you come out and see what its about.. and bring some friends
of course.


love pete

just a slight clarification: apparently many of you have the impression
that METAMORPHOSIS is an ele_mental event.  insomuch as two of the primary
promoters, titonton duvante and doug holmes (doughboy) are within the
ele_mental circle, it is an ele_mental-RELATED event.  but keep in mind
that 1/2 of the promotional team is melissa and walt of collective
intelligence (with assistance from jef pons as well).  their contribution
should not be obscured even though it may seem that i am the "voice" of
this event.

in fact, i am only marginally involved.  i am responsible for the EMERGE
pre-party on friday, which to me represents an attempt to fill some gaps
that could not be filled by the METAMORPHOSIS event (ie, tighter vibe,
low-key DJs, etc).  it's a different proposition, but it is closer to my
heart. 

all i know is that both events promise to be fantastic, if perhaps for
different reasons.

directions forthcoming.

EMERGE directions:

Those of you familiar with the Sothside Settlement House already know
what's gone down in that phat place.

Those of you who don't know:

>From the Northeast: 71 S -> downtown Columbus, exit Broad St and go Left.

>From the Northwest: take 75 to exit #156.  Follow Rt. 15 until it becomes
Rt. 23, follow 23 for 110 miles, pass Delaware and look for the 270
outerbelt.  Take 270 East for a couple miles to 71 South, then 10 miles to
downtown Columbus.  Exit at Broad St, take a Left. 

>From the South: 71 N -> downtown Columbus, pass downtown to Broad St, go
Right.

>From the East: 70 West -> downtown Columbus, find 71 North, follow less
than one mile to Broad St. exit.  Go Right at Broad.

>From the West: 70 East -> downtown Columbus, find 71 North, follow less
than one mile to Broad St. exit.  Go Right at Broad

Once on Broad you will go through a couple lights to Parsons Ave (you will
see a KFC on the corner).  Go Right on Parsons and follow it South for
12-13 lights.  Pass a Majestic Paint Center on the Right, then start
looking for a small street named Woodrow.  Go Right on Woodrow, follow it
for one short block to Washington, go Left on Washington, then one block
South to a small alley named Stanaford. 

At this point you will see the space on the Right, a large grey
school-looking concrete building with blue doors, named The Southside
Settlement House.  Entrance will probably be through the rear doors.  Any
problems call the ele_mental line at 614.470.0929 ext. 1. 

Admission is only $5 before 12 Midnight or $7 after.  The lineup is well
worth the dirt-cheap admission price.

This event will also be your last chance to purchase $18 pre-sale tickets
for METAMORPHOSIS, saving you a total of $5 off the door price.  In other
words if you come to EMERGE and get your pre-sale ticket, you'll be
getting 2 events for the price of one. 

Doors will open at about 11 PM and music will go until 7 AM or later.

* * * * * IMPORTANT INFORMATION: PLEASE READ FIRST

pre-sale tickets are still available at culture 7, world record, and
avalon (columbus)  for $18, admission at the door will be $23 (up from $22
due to unforseen last-minute expenses).  your last chance to purchase $18
pre-sale tickets will be at the EMERGE pre-party.  pre-sale tickets will
still be available at stores for **$22** the day of the event. 

you are encouraged to purchase pre-sale tickets because capacity at the
space MAY be exceeded early in the evening, so having your pre-sale ticket
and arriving early (before 11 PM) will help guarantee problem-free entry
to the event.  parking capacity may also be exceeded, so again, your best
bet is to get there early. 

also keep in mind that in order to safeguard a clean and worry-free event,
alcohol WILL NOT BE PERMITTED.  NO OPEN BOTTLES OF ANY KIND WILL BE
PERMITTED.  you MAY bring water and other beverages as long as they are
NOT OPEN. 

also: there will be NO RE-ENTRY (barring emergencies) until 4 AM. 
port-a-potties will be the only accessible bathrooms, so BE PREPARED. 
one room is ocurring outside so dress appropriately.

finally, this is an all ages event.

DIRECTIONS:

the space is located immediately across from the Buggyworks building which
houses club Mekka.

from the Northeast: 71 S -> downtown Columbus -> 670 W

from the Northwest: 75 S -> exit #156 -> rt. 15/rt.23 S -> 270 E -> 71 S
-> downtown Columbus -> 670 W 

from the South: 71 N -> through downtown Columbus -> 670 W

from the East or West: 70 to downtown Columbus -> 71 N -> 670 W

follow 670 W for about one mile to NEIL AVE exit.  go LEFT on neil and
head south for less than 1/2 mile.  find DUBLIN AVE and go RIGHT.  drive
two short blocks to corner of HANOVER.  space is the white warehouse on
the left.  to park, take a left on hanover and park behind the fenced-in
area.

again, read the information above regarding open containers, re-entry, and
bathroom facilities.

well i think i have a ride to metamorphosis. i'm so excited. i might
forget about the netmeet but i'll try to remember. gotta write it in
marker on both hands or something. =] i'm not sure what shirt i'm
going to wear probably a silver one, and nondescript blue jeans. + if
i'm cold a black sweatshirt that says elias on the back. i have a
clear + lavender colored backpack. my hair is brown but longer than it
used to be & pulled back. so now you can find me. i will be dancing a 
lot, watching the DJs, & cheering + blowing my whistle. now you know
where i will be.

um....yes to open turntables...no to OFFICIAL after hours...more like i
have an office w/ some space and a lounge and tons of computers and a great
view of downtown right beside the old pen.....so for one thing it's not
even sure, because there might be some official after-hours that are larger
and seem more fun, but i'm keeping the option open for any of my net raves
or cool people there who would want a small scale fling (20-30 people, max
50...loll...yea like that ever works : )

oh and secondly, i don't know what i was thinkin'....i had NO intention of
disin' the collective intelligence crew, who have done tons of work to help
make this a group effort.....i just have a habit of writing the least info,
including promotion info...i am really sorry, and hope no one wants to
shoot me...or if you do, that you will wait 'til after the party...: )

can't wait to see ya there
david

ps....there are supposed to be a whole shit load of afterhours, plus some
after effects of the RED party...so there will be SOMETHING to do.....

                CHECK OUT  www.partnercomm.com/~raveinfo/ 	


                  The RAVEDATA project needs your help!
 

 Some of you have seen our messages on the list, some can tell you how
they like using our "North American Rave Promoter Index" also known as the
"fonebook" to get connected, and still others might say how they have
enjoyed trading mixtapes and flyers with us...

 That's just the beginning!  We've been aggresively compiling data for
20 months, known as the Ravedata project...  We're just about ready to
present the result: the world's largest rave-oriented database -- tracking
all KINDS of information,worldwide!  Why?  

	1 - To bring more talent and energy together (unity)
	2 - To recognize those in the scene who have done so much
             (respect)
	3 - To factually "set the record straight" after a lot of bad 
             news media (peace)
	4 - To bring alive those memories of our favorite events gone-by
             and our friends who were there to share them with us (love)


If that's RAVE D-A-T-A, What's this RAVE I-N-F-O stuff??
--------------------------------------------------------
 Raveinfo is what we call our attempt to ask YOU for those missing
bits and pieces of information we've missed along the way.  We can't do it 
alone... So, check out the site and e-mail us with *ANY* info you may
have!!  We've just re-organized some things to make it even easier to get
around and will finish that up tomorrow.

 We hope you look forward to seeing the ravedata site sometime in December 
and requesting your copy of the Fonebook ('98 edition) sometime in 
January (as always, it will be free).

Thanks!!

Love and Lollipops-
  Matt & Nicole
  (Cyphonix & Angel)

i got 2 mixtapes at metamorphosis (but i didn't review them before
since i hadn't listened to them enough yet) i like them a lot. so here
are the reviews:

Hypnotic 23 & D.R.C.-Attack of the 50 ft. Acid Tab

track list:
Cari Lekebusch-Phunkey Rhythm Doctor
Lenk- Motions E.P-P-Motions E.P-P-Rhythm
Danijel Alpha-Le Grand Pricks-Hybrid
Thomas Krome-Wood Carver-Code Red
D.J. Tuttle-Sub Sounds 008
Tobias Schmidt-Is it Peace to Point the Gun?-Tresor
D.J. Misjah-His Jam E.P.-X Trax
Casseo Paya E.P.-X Trax
The High Tech Child-"Tribal Storm"-Mind Star
Dave the Drummer-Assault E.P.-Boscoland
Salamander-VCF
D.J. Choci-Chochi's Chewns
Chochi & Injector-Chochi's Chewns
Voodoo-White Label 024

this tape seems to have more tracks on it than what is listed, but
it's hard to figure out if + what they are. anyway i don't think it is
tagteam since each DJ's name is on each side. Hypnotic 23's side is
mainly hard minimal techno with some hard trance & acid, DRC's side
has a little more hard trance + more acid altogether. the overall
mixing is pretty good although there are a couple mixes that are a
little off.  the cover of the tape has braille on it, which is
interesting; i can't tell if the braille says the same thing as the
writing or not.


din-sortie alpha

track list:
       -side 1-
Stephen Brown-Gas Mask
The Advent-It One Jah (Surgeon Mix)
The Advent-It One Jah (Bicknell Mix)
Purpose Maker-Black is the Number
Adam Beyer & Lenk-Drumcode 1 (A2)
Adam Beyer-Drumcode 2 (A1)
Space DJs-Sims
Johannes Heil-Brainsurfer
Silvershower-Ice Fractions vol. 1
Planetary Assault Systems-Funk Electric
Nuclear Family-Half-Life
Surgeon-Magneze

       -side 2-
Adam Beyer-Drumcode 2 (A2)
Morph-Stormwatch (Advent Mix)
Unknown-Untitled
The Advent-Bad Boy (Luke Slater Mix)
The Advent-Mad Dog
Jeff Mills-The Dancer
Adam Beyer & Lenk-Drumcode 1 (A1)
Brother's Yard-Blue 2
Robert Hood-Moveable Parts
Steve Bicknell-Lost Recording D2
D.H.S.-The House of God (Surgeon Mix)
Surgeon-Muggerscumout
Regis-Promo B2

i had not heard of this DJ before, this tape is somewhat harder than
the other one + also minimal techno. the mixing is really good except
for the fact that there are too many backspins: like 5 or 6. the 1st
side isn't that consistent: the 1st track is ambient then the next one
is hard + it's mixed in pretty quickly, it could have been done more
gradually, then there's another track i think funk electric that
doesn't really fit in; the 2nd side though is put together better.

Hey all.

Just wondering how Format turned out last Friday in Pgh.  Looked like it

Thanks...

Hey Everyone... (this is first time I have addressed this whole list at the
same time, so bear with me if my info is a little incomplete...spanks)

Jack-O-Land, a party in Chicago on Halloween, IS supposed to have Daft Punk
headline. My brother, DJ Kevy Kev aka graphic designer Kevin Grimm, did the
flyer for the party, and is also spinning at the party as well. These flyers
might already be out, he told me last week to look for them at Metamorphosis,
but I didn't get a chance to go ;-(   I am definitely gonna check out
Jack-O-Land {{yeah, so there is a little bias there}} and I don't have an
info line on it yet, but look for the flyer, or email my brother at the
following address "kg2@coil.com" for more info, or I will post the info when
I get it... below are two other events that I know of... I dont know their
names, but their info lines are listed below as well as city locations... can
anyone provide further info on these?

(Name?), Nashville, TN, Friday, October 31st, (615) 780.2900
(Name?-Spawntaneous-), Cleveland, Friday, October 31st, (216) 980.0188

p.s. does anyone know anything about Scott Henry spinning in Pittsburgh this
Saturday night at a party called something "Transphatic"? Random info came to
me on that one... 

Hope to see some of you out sometime!  --Casey--

a very intricate and deeply creative flyer usually makes a good party
(aside from all the logistics of course).. which is what is making me plan
to go to this event and ask for a ride if anyone has space...

Saturday October 25th
Ultraworld brings us (very politically correctly i might add)

*THINK*

12 Noon until 12 Midnight in the DC Armory
(most people wont go becuase of this but hey, i didnt hear one complaint
from anybody that went to Pheonix, also a day party with plenty afterhour
house parties i reckon)

featuring talents of:
DONALD GLUADE
ESP WOODY McBRIDE
SCOTT HENRY
TIGA
STACEY PULLEN
LOVEGROVE
ENTITY
FEELGOOD

Sound by Total Audio
their turbosound rigs at the previous armory events boasted "Largest sound
systems ever at an east coust dj event" as the flyer says, and they're
adding more 24" subbase cabinets

Lights by Supercal + Eyegasm and three giant visual screens by Optical Delusion
one 4 color laser and two argon l asers by P.A.W.N.

only $19  up to October 1
$24 after and $30 at door

no ohio ticket outlets unfortunately
Slacker has em (pittsburgh) 412.381.3911
and if you can charge it, ticketmaster is there 202.432.7328

so how about a carload of us?
i can organize getting the tickets if someone wants to drive,
for they will only be $19 for five more days..

well, i think i was there when aDk think tank members were giving birth to
this party and im actually suprised thats its on the grid becuase they
havent been talking about it at all *shrug*
i say there will probably wont be an aDk event until New Years Eve (stay
tuned for that one)  Im pretty sure the Halloween event metioned on the
grid was a premature post since there are no flyers.. but i could be
ignorantly mistaken so i'll ask one of them about it and get back to yall.
   As Far as I know, The New Years Event is gonna be rocking, but im not
priveledged at this stage to know who is confirmed.. rumors of dubtribe and
dj dan have been filtering through to me tho..they have a preflyer out but
no infoline yet..

tasty tidbit in yesterday's "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" of all places:

<<So they Say>>
"The Chemical Brothers are hard rock!  Americans are so dumb!  the one 
band they pick as electronic, and it's a rock band.  It's like MTV did a 
show with Wu-Tang Clan and called it a rockumentary; it's rap!  If it's 
not four white guys holding a beer, then they don't know what to do with 
it."

--Bjork Gudmunsdottir, Iceland's pop diva, quoted in New York's monthly 
magazine Paper.

Ultraworld parties are definately worth the trip.  "THINK" about it.

I'm from the Washington, D.C. area and attended 'RITUAL' last April, 
which included a live performance by Rabbit In The Moon.  
The Armory is an awesome site, and once you enter you can never tell it is 
daylight outside.  The vibe inside is even better. Ritual was easily the 
best rave I've ever been to, sound wise, location wise, and light wise.
I don't think I will be able to go however. And if I can it will end up 
being a last minute thing.  If anyone happens to be going and will be in 
town Friday nite, please check out BUZZ.  It was voted the best weekly 
club event in the nation and best artwork for its flyers. Believe me, it 
lives up to its billing!

Hope everyone makes the trip,

 smooth(DC Raver going to school in the Pittsburgh area)

~~~~> I also am from the D.C. area originally (now live in Cleveland) and I
agree whole-heartedly with you about Ultraworld parties. I was also at Ritual
in April with Scott Henry, Rabbit in the Moon, LTJ Bukem, Halo, and who could
forget Josh Wink's birthday set? I always have had a BOMB time at D.C.
parties. Although heavily "guarded" and filled with security (what do you
want? its at an armory) :-) I managed to dance my a$$ off... <<side note:  It
is just too bad that the party coincided with one of the Midwest's best
parties two years in a row now, "420" here in Cleveland.>> Anyway, D.C. and
Ultraworld parties have my vote as well... I didnt't get to attend
Ultraworld's "IT" in Philly, but many of my friends did and had an incredible
experience as well.  Try not to miss "THINK", I know I won't if I can afford
the gas money by then...hehe... 

Take care everyone... hope to meet some of you soon... --Casey--

ok, i know that no one on here has probably ever gone to this club, and 
you probably already know the story, so i'll just reiterate.
Club Stratus (on Forbes) employs racist policies.
Do not go.  Make the manager realize that he is an ass.
Tell everyone you know not to go.
(That is, provided that you don't agree with racist policies. :P)

ok, getting down off my soapbox :P

There were some flyers posted for it here at CMU.  However, someone
posted to a local b-board that this was not a real party, and asked for
people to take flyers down.  So who knows????

i won't go.

it looks pretty cheesy and i heard that it is a filth junction.  it always
gets raided and is for the more normal type-dance clubbers.  what sort of
bad experience [racist] happened there (to you)?

what is their address? we could write them a joint letter.

i typed this up + sent it once already but it apparently didn't go to
the list. =[ i heard about this earlier but just last nite got the
full info. here is basically what is happening:
***********************************************************************
thursday, 5 pm: free event with DJ Spooky, Scanner, Mike Filly, Rob
Sherwood. on the kent state campus.
***********************************************************************
the text of the flyer is below. ACPB is All Campus Programming Board;
i don't know who Scanner is; i am kind of wary about the MC part since
i'm not sure what the "digital domain" is + that radio station is the
alternative rock station (scary), in thieveland; and this isn't a
party but it's not exactly a homecoming dance (?) =/, anyway...it's
some sort of event. reply to me for directions.

scanner is a wickkkkkkkked and innnnnovative electronic audio artist (i won't
call him a musician, but that does not mean that what he does does not pack a
beat or that it is "experimental" in the oft-used electronic music sense of the
word which generally is a synonym for KRAP, imHo).  i think you can still check
out sampulls of his stuff at www.obsolete.com, a site i discovered while looking
for ~swim records and/or g~man info.  i have not heard any other scanner
material, i have not ever seen/heard scanner live (though from what i read it
sound like it would be as inspiring and thought provoking as watching the Big
Bang), and i do not work for scanner...but, if my schedule allowz i'm sure i'll
make effortz to get there to see spooky and scanner.  thanks gretaz!

--gill

p.s.  could anyone give ani info on far/long this place is from downtown and
what general direction it's in?

p.p.s  notice how i ever so politically-correctly abstained from making any
comments whatsoever about those other deejays? ;]

sorry i'm posting this with relatively short notice; i heard about it
a while ago but didn't get full info until last nite. this isn't
exactly a party, i'm not sure what to call it, a homecoming dance? =/
well, it's FREE, it will be taking place on the kent state campus. 
(ACBP stands for All Campus Programming Board, i don't know who 
scanner is, does anybody know? and i am a little wary of the "MC" part
since i don't know what the "digital domain" is & that radio station 
is the alternative rock station (scary), in cleveland. anyway the full
text of the flyer is as follows:

Thursday, October 2						   KSU
						            Homecoming
ACPB presents		       					  1997
The Abstrakt Transmission Tour starring 

	DJ Spooky
	with special guest scanner

	Mike Filly & Rob Sherwood from Trilogy

	Guest MC, The Digital Domain's Pete the Dog from 107.9 The End

						    starting at 5 p.m.

Bonfire
Pep Rally						       F R E E
(Introduction of Homecoming Court)
8 p.m.
						      Manchester Field
					  (Rain Location KSU Ballroom)

Our girl is SSOOOOOO on point.  It's true that the only thing Americans
can hack is beer rock.  Alternative used to mean soemthing, then it all
started to sound like Sabbath.  Punk used to sound like something, then it
turned into pop.  And now Prodigy and Atari Teenage Riot sound to me like
Beavis and Butthead music.  

But hey, it's all good by me cuz it means that MY music is safely tucked
away.  We are pretty dumb, though.  :P

)<<So they Say>>
)"The Chemical Brothers are hard rock!  Americans are so dumb!  the one 
)band they pick as electronic, and it's a rock band.  It's like MTV did a 
)show with Wu-Tang Clan and called it a rockumentary; it's rap!  If it's

i was not at IT! last spring... i had a feeling that it would be totally
gross... most parties which are publicised as the "event of the year"
tend to be disappointing... its the nature of expectations more than
anything else... thing is, if the whole world intends to go to a
party... there will be WAY too many people there... as was the case at
IT! from what i understand. Friends went w\ tickets in hand and were
turned away at the door... thats enough to make me happy that i didnt
bother to attempt to be there...

regarding Ultraworld... arnt they aka Circle K productions?? from what
i've heard there parties have been successful moneywize [comercially]
but not w\ regards to important shit... like [customer] satisfaction. i
give them my respect for trying to put together something of this
magnitude (god knows a party... no matter how small... doesnt put itself
together... it takes a lot of time  and energy... [and of course money])
but i dont understand why theyd even want to throw a party that big...

it reminds me of fantasia 3... another party which i just knew would go
the way of IT! (they also said that would be the "event of the year" (or
was it Summer???) ... friends who were there described it as "the first
party i was at that i wanted to leave ten minutes after walking through
the door." ...usually, we give the party a chance b4 we totally give up
on it...

having said all this, i've never been to an Ultraworld party.. but i
look at the line-up, and location when i decide which party i will
attend...

Costas.

a while ago i saw a flyer advertising 3d, snuggles, and phantom 45 in
cleveland on wednesday. is this still going on? 

supposedly the u4ia ppl are bringing in peshay on wednesday, as well.

WHY IS IT that this city can go for weeks without anything and then all of
a sudden there are a million things to do all within days of each other?!
(and in this case on the same night!) i'd like to see our friendly
promoters work together rather than competing or overloading all the time.
but alas, i know that is too much to ask for.

Ed Luna (ele_mental) invited me to Columbus, Ohio the weekend before last
to play at Emerge, the preparty for Metamorphosis.  Highlights:  Friendly
hosts and new friends, DJ Shiva from Indy, hard-working and entertaining
techno DJs, enlightening conversation, outstanding audience response, the
vibe at Metamorphosis, and Tintonton.

Ed is a man with a vision.  ele_mental is one of those wonderful quirks of
nature, a self-sustaining experiment based on stretching the old noggin
and providing an outlet and experience that people wouldn't get if it
weren't for their hard work, vision and persistence. 

Emerge, the ele_mental pre-party, was a tight little event in a lovely
space, featuring up- and-coming DJs in varying degrees.  No one was
cracked out, most people in the room where the music was were dancing, and
the audience was very educated and totally atuned to what the DJs were
doing.  Not that I'm all that and a waffle cone or anything, but after I
finished this one mix, a kid who'd been spotting it actually shook my hand
and complimented me on it.  When a DJ would pull off a great trick or
tweak the EQs, the crowd knew exactly what was going on and responded. 
Another thing I noticed is that the techno DJs I saw really worked it. 
Out here on the east coast you get a lot of laid- back DJs (I even know of
one who carefully places a finger on the spindle...it doesn't do shit, but
it "looks good."), but out there, they totally worked it from their faces
to their fingers on the EQs to the bobbing of their entire
bodies.

Lisa, DJ Shiva, went on after me and ripped shit up with a slightly funky
take on Detroit...I think...being that I'm pretty much a jungle snob,
anything without breaks is either house or techno to me, and falls
somewhere along the scale between "blippy" and "funky"...  The girl was
tight.  She'd been spotting my set too, and we started talking about
music.  Turns out she also spins jungle, so when Adair couldn't make it
because of transportation problems, she and I tagged for about 1/2 an
hour.  People loved the semi- silly party-type stuff we were throwing on. 
I guess they really don't get much jungle out there in the Midwest because
they sopped it up like sunshine.  They definitely loved to feel funky. 
hip hop samples were winners.  no surprise in the land of ghetto booty
house... ;)

So anyway, I learned a lot watching her and the other techno DJs of the
night tweak their butts off and put on great shows.  Again, the crowd gets
mad mad mad props.  I got some suggestions for some cool records to check
out.  The cops also get props for waltzing in and waltzing out and
actually being friendly.  :) 

We stayed at Leah's house, a girl who has done vocals for Joe1.8.7 and
Tintonton, and that was homey and relaxing.  Stopped at Culture 7.  I'm
not used to seeing dance music stores in strip malls, much less decent
ones.  :)  Went to Kevin/Blip and Charles/Monochrome's place for a
satisfying dinner and great conversation. 

It was there that Ed laid it all out for me.  I complained that a lot of
the jungle out lately, although it's technically admirable, even amazing,
musically falls short or goes nowhere, and he explained that the way he
sees it, England has been pushing jungle toward techno.  Away from more
narrative construction and more toward abstractions, I suppose. Makes
sense to me, and now that I think about it, I was edging toward listening
that way all along, but I was fighting it.  it's weird how many directions
everything is going in...hip hop and soul meet jungle, jungle meets
techno, garage meets jungle, garage vs. booty, the comeback of ragga, and
tons of stuff I don't even know about.  It's like a fruit basket.

So we went to Metamorphosis that night and the vibe was great because
everyone expected it to be great.  The music was a bit lacking I thought. 
Everyone thought they were DMC champs, and there was the occasional
screechy MC.  I wish DJs who scratched would listen to tapes of themselves
and honestly decide whether it's actually musical.  I also wish they'd
listen to old DJ Cherokee tapes.  :)  J Majik was too sick to play
(bummer) but I am here to tell you that Tintonton should be heard.  At his
peak he was as technical as Photek, experimental as Funky Porcini,
rhythmic as Max Roach, and funky as electro. 

I was only able to catch 2 installments of a few minutes each, but they
were worth it. Both times I've seen him in person he looks like he just
lost his best friend, but at the decks he was a passionate showman, like
spinning is some kind of heroine.  I must have gotten there at the middle
of his set.  He was scratching (musically) and doing hip hop tricks.  He
scratched all over an acappella snippet that said "Don't front."  Yes!  He
proceeded to scratch out some starts and fits of syncopation that echoed
jazz drumming. When the tunes started again they were the kind that NEVER
make me dance, yet I danced.  He was able to highlight something I'd never
heard before.  Again, I think it was the relationship between (Detroit)
techno and jungle.  Later he seemed to loose some of that energy, but it
was still pretty cool. 

Late in the evening Ed Luna set up a third stage right on the ground.  He
was spinning techno, quite well I might add, with no headphones.  A friend
of his and I relieved him and started improvising with techno, Kraftwerk,
Miles Davis, Roni Size, etc.  There were some good moments.  Then
headphones came (thank you, joe!). 

A little after dawn I went on again and a little crowd was digging the
vibe.  It was a great little impromptu thing, my favorite kind.  I loved
being able to give some thirsty junglists something of a fix, especially
as the sun came up, espcially on such a low-key, ghetto- style system.  I
say that not out of arrogance, but out of happiness, discovery,
appreciation, and renewed hope. 

Ed then came on and showed up my crowd-pleasers with some actual head
music. ;) I felt a little sheepish, but happy to hear stuff I might have
dismissed a week ago with an updated perspective.  Then I made the journey
home and wasn't in bed till after 2 monday morning.  boy, was i grumpy at
work. 

Even this epic of a post really only scratches the surface.  There were
lots more great DJs and people that deserve mention, but this ain't no
stinking credits list.  ;)  If you can find the kind of people who found
me, I recommend a weekend in Columbus.  Many thanks to all.

Atari Teenage Riot sounds like it did four years ago; they haven't changed
their sound to cater to the MTV generation.  Banging 909s, screeching
guitars, ramming amens, shouting... traditional Alec Empire fare.

It's just that they're on Grand Royal now that people are going "yeah!  I
know them!"

i totally agree with you, ed luna is a really great promoter- i had the
opportunity to spin for him also, in may- he seems to have genuine
interest in promoting new talent, and is totally unpretentious. i have
much respect for what he's doing out in columbus..

i heard mixed reviews of that party.. prolly somewhat like a huge huge club
event. i heard it grossed 5000 people, but some people hype up numbers..
ick i dont like events that big in an enclosed sapce.. you can get super
lost or just get super weird.

anyhoo, THINK promises to be a lot different than IT, as i am supposing. I
am buying my ticket at slacker tonite or tommorow morning.. they are $19
till wednesday and $24 after that just so you know..

hehe me too, i hade a ride but was not about to get schooled by a
"corporate"  (as steph says) mass inferno of kids completely hyped to get
disappointed. If you're smart you can tell which ones will be like that..
(ie flyers with three or four pages, a room just for 21 year olds, lots of
BIG names, etc.)

Circle K, i have heard that as well...
with regards to customer satifaction, I hear more people less satisfied
with important "underground" parties than i do at events where what is
promised is delivered. I do understand however, that smaller less hyped
parties can be full of great surprises and definately have their place in
the scene. THINK is not trying to be on the DL, for they know they are not
doing anything illegal. On the flyer they say, "To all those who are
seeking to harass, slander, or hinder our events, if you can't live by the
rules of this country, you are free to leave it" They have had occurences
where the people enforcing the law were only enforcing the majorities
suspicion thus they were forced to either shut down or relocate. That
bullshit is usually unavoidable unless you feel like paying off cops.

simply, more people = more bizzness = more money = more clout. Enough of
all four elements at the end of night secures advancement to the next
event.  Throwing parties in and around the nations capital carries a lot of
politics with it. You must be as democratic and socratic as possible.

 To a symobolic exent, Ultraworld and Bassrush represent the rave promoters
of america to a lot of nonraver/weekendraver/trainspotterraver eyes... i
dont care if you diss their parties or not,  i think theyre used to that.
However, they have a lot of balls to become emerged in that position of
representing a very public aproach to rave (with regards to the Bill of
Rights) and they still come out serving the majority properly and without
too much bullshit.

 Im not saying they should come off like kings and pimps, but they are
leaders who know how to gather 2000+ heavily spirited individuals and
entertain them for more than 10 hours.  Shit, most politicians (aka
America's leaders) can't do that. Sometimes bullshit happens, but i think
its way wrong to blame the promoters, because they really are in it for the
love of people.

 I reckon that most people who attend Bassrush and Ultraworld events for
the first time do NOT come out of it complaining about how it sucked. I
assure you, the people that do that are ones that have already been there
and are seeing what they have already seen, not attempting to look at,
hear, or be something different...they must get out of their timetrapped
minds and recognize the celebration of life that is going on....reaching
out to more people is almost garunteed to propell this movement, becuase
while you sitting here thinking about this, someone somewhere else is
licking their first blowpop, and being happy about that.

 I have never been to an ultraworld event either. Regardless, they have
given me enough things to "think" about attending, to think about the
future of rave, the future of music, as i know somehow i will fit in the
scheme of representing it. it doesnt matter as much whos spinning; the fact
that they are spinning music they want you to dance and free your mind to
is good enough for me. AND IT MUST BE LOUD AND MUST HAVE REPETITIVE BEATS,
which it will..... for sure.

peace

on the bandwagon tip, ele-mental has had their stuff together since i have
come in contact with the world of mind music appreciation collaborated with
dreamy music making reassurances. I went to one of their renegade events
and experienced what only stephanie could describe Tintonton Duvante as "a
passionate showman, like spinning is some kind of heroine."  I had so much
fun the three hours i was at this warehouse and after words hanging around
in columbus with a vraver and people i barely knew but were accomadating,
pleasant and interesting that i came back for a $10 event called Intimate,
organized by Tintonton himself, with Ed's help. They were showcasing Morgan
Geist, a techno artist probably dying to play out to a lot of people. The
vibe of that party was so nice.. i met
some big dj from detroit and he was so incredibly nice. Too bad i forget
his name. Anyway i just want to say that ele-mental is true to all facets
that they stand for.. and their webpage is full of interesting things to
read, learn and be influenced by. (you can learn about the eveloution of
electronic music! its been around for a little longer than you might
think..)

forgive my ignorance.... but whats a trainspotterraver??? is it someone
who goes to parties for the drugs???

also, dont missunderstand me.. i love big parties... the bigger, the
better... but its MUCH harder for a big party to be successful (in all
respects) than it is for a smaller one. i personally usually attend big
parties and they are usually just beautiful... however, most of these
parties have been huge on there own... people see the teaser, and then
the flier w\ the ultracool line up... and they decide to come out...

i dont believe that was the case for IT!... (did u see the flier [read
short-form-novel] for that thing???) personally there were too many
house dj's for my tastes... but like, if u are spending that much to
throw a party... (what were there like 30 dj's?)... including that dude
who is reported to charge $10,000 bucks an hour... (although i dont
believe this) then i mean u either know taht they expect this party to
have a HUGE turnout (how else would they pay for alll this??) or you are
just clueless...

thats what i mean when i said this event was too big... (although i have
attended bigger parties that were just increadible... and the third
party in this sequence is comming up on October 11... it should be SO
cool....) 10,000... people... for the most part HAPPY...
YEIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII... i cant wait.

Costas.

Daaang...
y'alls are ignant 'n 'at...

Ultraworld and Special/Circle K productions are, and always have been
seperate entities.

Both are big, both are commercial.  Trainspotters?  I don't know about
that either... with parties of that magnitude, i bet 1/20th of the kids
are actually concerned with what's being dropped.

And, who's $10,000 an hour.  That sounds like a vicious rumor.

hmmm flyers that brag about all the events the promoters have done scare
me. i don't think i'm about to forget which promoters i respect. if
they've thrown good events + have good intentions, i already know that, if
they haven't, their flyer will not change my mind about their
reputability.

I disagree... I think that promoters that feel confident enough to post a
list of past parties they have thrown, have nothing to hide. (no scams if
you will)
I mean why would you put a list of your  past parties on a flyer, if they
sucked. I think if a promoter has thrown a slew of grade "A" parties, why
not remind people that it was his production party that threw em!!?
I mean I am really proud of almost all of the parties I have throw in the past,
and I think most people know when they see my company's name that it will
be a quality party, so why not list past accomplishments?

Yes, Circle K productions=Circle Productions=Special K productions-- been
around since 92 (give or take a year.)

What I was saying is, they're not Ultraworld, or affiliated with
Ultraworld.

that's it.

Yeah, there is a party called Fuckin Blast Off this friday, but it is here in
Cleveland, not columbus,,, I repeat...In Cleveland! cool huh? Anyway, here is
info number on it...
 Fuckin' Blast Off, Cleveland, Friday, October 3rd, (216) 556.1294
 I personally am going to Revibe, only because I am going to the OSU vs. Iowa
game on Saturday, and will already be down in Columbus for that party, and I
am getting old, not to mention poor from all of these parties, so I can't
stay up for two nights in a row anymore ;-)  But it looks like a phat-ass
time!! It's a Chicago House party: James Christian, DJ Funk, etc. Have fun
everyone!
