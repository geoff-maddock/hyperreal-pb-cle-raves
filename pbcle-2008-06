Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Jun 14                  MESSIN WITH SASQUATCH                Oxford, OH

Okay, we all know General Malice will kill you. We all know camping is 
okay, but camping with Sasquatch is teh $h17z!!1! We all know that this 
summer is about to fuckin pop off and Messin With Sasquatch is gonna be 
the launch pad for all the craziness this summer. So, you may be asking 
yourselves," How can I get into this event for free?". Well, there is 
one way and one way only. Ya gotta dress like a Sasquatch. Ya can't 
sneak in if ya look like a raver, only in the guise of the Yeti would 
one be able to get past security and make their way to the heart of the 
forest where all the real headz reside. If you dress like a sasquatch 
you may be able to infiltrate.

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

Sat Jun 14                  MESSIN WITH SASQUATCH                Oxford, OH

Okay, we all know General Malice will kill you. We all know camping is 
okay, but camping with Sasquatch is teh $h17z!!1! We all know that this 
summer is about to fuckin pop off and Messin With Sasquatch is gonna be 
the launch pad for all the craziness this summer. So, you may be asking 
yourselves," How can I get into this event for free?". Well, there is 
one way and one way only. Ya gotta dress like a Sasquatch. Ya can't 
sneak in if ya look like a raver, only in the guise of the Yeti would 
one be able to get past security and make their way to the heart of the 
forest where all the real headz reside. If you dress like a sasquatch 
you may be able to infiltrate.

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Subject: {pb-cle} Need a big PA system?

My boy J.P. is selling a bigass P.A. and really needs to get rid of it
before he moves!  There's an eBay listing with all the information
here:

http://cgi.ebay.com/2-B-52-LX1515-800W-PA-speakers-Crown-XLS602amp-cables_W0QQitemZ140240391334QQihZ004QQcategoryZ47094QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem

However, if you're part of a production company or just a raver who
likes big speakers, he encourages you to contact him directly at
james.hutchins@oberlin.edu and he might be able to cut you some kind
of a deal.  Serious inquiries only, please.  The speakers are located
in Oberlin, OH (about a half hour SW of Cleveland) and you'll probably
need a pickup truck, or at least a really big station wagon to pick
them up.

He's prefer to sell them to ravers than random folks on eBay, so
please let him know if you have any interest or know someone who does!

PLUR and taco-flavored kisses,
sparky

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Jam Solid Productions & B.A.D. ASS. present 
Temptation 
Friday June 20, 2008 
Cleveland OH. 
Metropolis Nightclub 

Temp.ta.tion- 
1.something that tempts, entices, or allures. 

Featuring: 

RICKY STONE- PROGRESSIVE-HONG KONG- DJ MAG TOP 100 2005, 2006, 2007 
DJing and producing is all about talent and personality and Ricky Stone 
has bags of both. His ability to connect with clubbers and bring dance 
floors alive is truly outstanding. Originally from the Steel City of 
Sheffield, Ricky rocked clubs and raves across the UK before continuing 
his rise in the east. Moving to Asia in 2002, he set up base in the 
pulsating city of Hong Kong and swiftly forged a bright future as one of 
the region.s most sought-after DJs. So when Sasha toured China for the 
first time in 2004, Ricky was the one chosen to accompany him, 
performing at every single show on his Involver tour. Fast forward a few 
months and DJ Magazine was documenting the scale of Ricky.s rise, as he 
became the very first Hong Kong/China-based artist to break into their 
prestigious Top 100 DJs Poll. Voted #48 in the world by masses of loyal 
supporters in 2005, he proceeded to climb eight places to #40 in 2006 
and is currently on a roll as the poll.s highest ranked DJ based in 
Asia! 


DJ SWAMP-TURNTABLISM / HIP HOP / DRUM & BASS-LOS ANGELES- Legendary 
turntablist , USA DMC Champion 1996,also known for his work with Beck 
and The Crystal Method . He has sold over 100,000 records completely 
independently 
He was also in the DJ documentary "Scratch" and the movie "CLOCK 
STOPPERS" 
Bulletproof recording artist 


DJ FIXX- BOTTOM-END RECORDS/ illeven:eleven- BREAKBEAT / ELECTRO / DRUM 
N BASS- ROCHESTER NY- As one of the pioneers of the US funky breaks 
movement, DJ Fixx has proven that he is a breakbeat mainstay. His 
incredible production prowess and intense DJ performances are evidence 
of his staying power. Running his own independent monthly breakbeat 
label, Bottom-End Records, Fixx has dropped tracks consistently over the 
past three years and continues to do so making it one of the top five 
best-selling breakbeat labels in the country. Prior to the legacy of 
Bottom-End, Fixx produced over 75 breakbeat anthems on the classic 
Kaleidoscope Music label over the span of three years. Add to that his 
current involvement as half of the production duo 'KMFX,' with his 
long-time counterpart Keith MacKenzie, and Fixx is a veritable 
production machine, with tracks out on Keith's Illeven:Eleven Recordings 
imprint as well. With over 150 12-inch releases out and five 
massively-distributed CDs under his belt, DJ Fixx has compiled one of 
the largest bodies of breakbeat production work to date, and with that 
comes one of the largest followings in the US.

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Sat Jul 19                    CHRISTMAS IN JULY                  Pittsburgh

July 19th, 2008

Pittsburgh PA
B.A.D. Ass. & Sinister Movement welcome you to.
Christmas in July!

Featuring...


Josh the Funky 1
(EV Inc., System Recordings, Funktion Recordings)
Chicago IL

Josh The Funky 1 hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A
DJ for over a decade his style covers the gamut of House, from Uplifting 
Vocals to Dirty Tech.... Pumpin Big-room to Jacking Chicago....its 
representative of the influences and fusions heard around the world in 
modern House Music. Ever the performer, .The Funky 1. has become 
synonymous with using scratching, loops, acapellas, & effects, while 
also playing on three CDJ decks, allowing for an unparallel level of 
creativity in his live sets.
Coming from a city so deeply rooted in House Music, it was interestingly 
enough hip-hop and the sub-culture around it that initially sparked his 
interest to pursue a career in the DJ world. Buying a pair of decks 
while still in grade school, Josh discovered the art of scratching and 
was instantly mesmerized. His passion and persistence for the art form 
proved to be worthwhile, as he has since become a D.M.C. Midwest 
Finalist and a winner of the W.M.C.- D.J. Spin-Off Battle. His first 
exposure to house music came through Chicago radio station B96 (96.3 
fm), where every Friday and Saturday night he locked into the sounds of 
DJ.s Julian .jumpin. Perez and Bad Boy Bill. It.s only naturally fitting 
then that in 2001 Josh The Funky 1 was hired to became a weekly resident 
on the exact same Mix Show that initially hooked him in. Nowadays you 
can find Josh at the forefront of digital era, with his own Radio 
Podcast on I-tunes, allowing him to go beyond the Chicago airwaves and 
reach a global audience of listeners.

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the

The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Sat Jul 19                    CHRISTMAS IN JULY                  Pittsburgh

July 19th, 2008

Pittsburgh PA
B.A.D. Ass. & Sinister Movement welcome you to.
Christmas in July!

Featuring...


Josh the Funky 1
(EV Inc., System Recordings, Funktion Recordings)
Chicago IL

Josh The Funky 1 hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A
DJ for over a decade his style covers the gamut of House, from Uplifting 
Vocals to Dirty Tech.... Pumpin Big-room to Jacking Chicago....its 
representative of the influences and fusions heard around the world in 
modern House Music. Ever the performer, .The Funky 1. has become 
synonymous with using scratching, loops, acapellas, & effects, while 
also playing on three CDJ decks, allowing for an unparallel level of 
creativity in his live sets.
Coming from a city so deeply rooted in House Music, it was interestingly 
enough hip-hop and the sub-culture around it that initially sparked his 
interest to pursue a career in the DJ world. Buying a pair of decks 
while still in grade school, Josh discovered the art of scratching and 
was instantly mesmerized. His passion and persistence for the art form 
proved to be worthwhile, as he has since become a D.M.C. Midwest 
Finalist and a winner of the W.M.C.- D.J. Spin-Off Battle. His first 
exposure to house music came through Chicago radio station B96 (96.3 
fm), where every Friday and Saturday night he locked into the sounds of 
DJ.s Julian .jumpin. Perez and Bad Boy Bill. It.s only naturally fitting 
then that in 2001 Josh The Funky 1 was hired to became a weekly resident 
on the exact same Mix Show that initially hooked him in. Nowadays you 
can find Josh at the forefront of digital era, with his own Radio 
Podcast on I-tunes, allowing him to go beyond the Chicago airwaves and 
reach a global audience of listeners.


And back from the jungle...

45 Thieves
(Conquest Jungle, 44limited, GSP)
Bangkok Thailand, Louisville KY

45 Thieves have been smashing records literally over people heads for 
over a decade. Two life long friends with a twisted vision of what dance 
music should real be have been pushing the Jungle music scene with their 
politically charged remixes and over the top stage antics. Junglist No 
Surrender, Junglist No Retreat!!!
