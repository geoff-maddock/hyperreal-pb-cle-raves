	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Egnogra

Guillermo crashed on planet Earth 24 years ago without a clue of his
existence, meantime he tries to remember and understands what it means
to be human. He spends his time listening to crazy musik, prolonged
hours infront of a computer and thinking a lot about life and its
meaning.. He enjoys the absurd and the bizarre as a healing therapy
for the soul and mind.
Born in Mexico City Egnogra relocated to San Francisco to study
animation and film and since then shaman films started as a television
show for independent filmakers, later he realized the target audience
werent alien audience so he shifted towards all his artistic tube in
direction of the Trance Scene.

Djing since 14 years old always a fan of crazy musik acompanied by the
misterious and the occult..
Egnogra founded shaman films records in 2005 with one vision to create
an outlet for both Visual Artists and Electronic Muscians,
and here is the result of the experiment..

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Subject: {pb-cle} Saturday, April 21st: DOC MARTIN @ Palm Bar, Pittsburgh

(For those who aren't aware, Palm Saturdays is a Saturday night weekly in 
Pittsburgh, which is free prior to 10pm and $5 afterwards on non-headlining 
nights. For those who like house & techno, this is not to be missed on any 
given week)


Palm Saturdays & Humanaut are proud to present a very special evening with 
Doc Martin.

Doc Martin began his mission on the decks back in the summer of 1986. His 
focus on house music from the land of funk and disco was triggered while 
playing the club and warehouse scene in San Francisco. As one of the major 
players in laying the foundations of a strong West Coast dance scene, Doc 
has always been a master of mixing the crowd with the music. Neatly avoiding 
pigeonholing while embracing a myriad of different styles, his sets create a 
warm unique vibe of empathy on the dance floor. Docs legendary 8 hour sets 
from Flammable Liquid, Sunday Love, underground lofts and warehouse parties 
knew no colors, age or sexual orientation. He regularly devastated dance 
floors at the prestigious Twilo in New York (rest in peace) and continues to 
do so today behind the decks of the world's most infamous clubs such as 
London's Fabric and New York's Cielo.

The Humanaut, first of his name, would like to invite you to yet another 
evening of upfront, forward-thinking dance music at Palm Bar. The experience 
may just change your face.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Apr 21                     JESSICA PARTIN                     Cleveland

Jessica Partin - Houston, TX
 
The ongoing love affair between electronic dance music and Jessica 
Partin began in 1996, at a time when her roots were firmly planted in 
the underground Houston punk music scene, singing lead vocals in a band 
at local venues and teaching her self to play bass guitar on the side. 
Upon exposure to house and techno, along with the concept of continuous 
mixing, Jessica quickly shifted her musical ambitions and began carving 
her own niche in the DJ world characterized by eclectic record 
selection, bold mixing techniques, and an ever-evolving style that 
breaks the barriers between genre distinctions.

With a solid history of DJ performances and residencies at notable clubs 
throughout the city, Jessica currently heads up The New Pop Consortium 
at The Mink (bi-monthly). She has made multiple appearances on 
'MK-ULTRA', the legendary Houston electronic music radio program, mixing 
live over the airwaves for listeners and in May 2006, she made her 
Proton Radio debut as a Featured Artist with exclusive mixes that also 
received airtime on Ibiza Global Radio 97.6 FM (Ibiza, Spain). In 
addition to previous experience playing at Spundae engagements alongside 
top international talent, Jessica has opened for world class DJs such as 
Baby Anne, Randall Jones, DJ Sulli, DJ Hyper, Fairmont (aka Jake 
Fairley), and Ryan Crosson (aka Berg Nixon) and continues to be a 
frequent guest DJ at some of Houston's best events, including the 
all-female DJ rendezvous, 'Les Femmes de la Nuit', 'Crossroads', 
'Rotate', 'Tastylick', and 'Choice', to name a few.

Her style can be described as a fusion of dirty electro-tinged house and 
funky minimal techno with a retro dance-punk edge but spans everything 
broadly from house and tech house to electro and techno. Inspired by 
what she identifies with, the foremost influence on Jessica's sound is 
where she has been. Music has become a living scrapbook of the places 
that she loves and with each record, a memory is shared through sonic 
waves, taking listeners across the world without ever leaving the dance 
floor.

With a hunger that can no longer be satiated on music consumption alone, 
Jessica Partin has entered the foray of producer and is currently 
working on original recordings and a collaboration project, with future 
plans of remix work and the incorporation of live vocals.

Guillermo will be doing visuals for us all night and

film and special effects.

Stay tuned for a full lineup announcement later this 
month...............

Egnogra

Guillermo crashed on planet Earth 24 years ago without a clue of his
existence, meantime he tries to remember and understands what it means
to be human. He spends his time listening to crazy musik, prolonged
hours infront of a computer and thinking a lot about life and its
meaning.. He enjoys the absurd and the bizarre as a healing therapy
for the soul and mind.
Born in Mexico City Egnogra relocated to San Francisco to study
animation and film and since then shaman films started as a television
show for independent filmakers, later he realized the target audience
werent alien audience so he shifted towards all his artistic tube in
direction of the Trance Scene.

Djing since 14 years old always a fan of crazy musik acompanied by the
misterious and the occult..
Egnogra founded shaman films records in 2005 with one vision to create
an outlet for both Visual Artists and Electronic Muscians,
and here is the result of the experiment..

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

House, Trance, Drum'n'Bass, Hardstyle, etc.

Local DJs are bringing it back together for an all electronic music 
night every Sunday night, starting Dec. 4, at the Spy in Downtown 
Cleveland's Warehouse District. Explicit Productions (Old School, 
Columbus) has come out of hibernation and into Cleveland to produce a No 
Bullshit, scene supporting, killer club night at one of Clevelands best 
venues for a great sunday of bangin' beats.

We're bringing in some Fresh Blood with some hot new resident DJs. You 
might not have heard of them, but you Definitely need to hear them. 
Check out:
DJ Howse Mowse
DJ Jason Damman
DJ Spyral
Robert Van Helsing
These guys are talented, spin some great music, and are down with the 
program to bring together a killer club night without a fifteen dollar 
cover. Moonshine will have a $5.00 cover ($8.00 for ages 18-20). We will 
bring in guest DJs. We will bring in special acts. We will try our 
damndest to do it all without raising the cover charge.

Subject: {pb-cle} Memorial Day w/ MARCO CAROLA @ Privilege Ultralounge, PGH 

World famous techno DJ, Marco Carola, hails from Naples, Italy, to give us 
the finest onslaught of frequencies Pittsburgh has ever seen.

Flyer coming soon...

Steve Simpson, Humanaut and Privilege are proud to present a very special 
evening with Marco Carola.

Now firmly established as one of the worlds premier techno DJs, the young 
Marco Carola could never have dreamed what laid ahead of him when sneaking 
into Neapolitan discotheques at the tender age of 13. With a vast array of 
production credits and a whole host of labels under his belt (Design, 1000, 
Zenit, Question, Do.Mi.No) Marco Carola has emerged in the last decade to be 
one of the city's (and Italys) most influential and pioneering techno and 
electronic artists.

The Humanaut, first of his name, would like to invite you to an evening of 
upfront, forward-thinking dance music at Privilege. The experience may just 
change your hair-do.

TICKETS
Purchase your presales from any Humanaut member, www.groovetickets.com, or 
directly from Privilege (ask the bartenders).
Tickets by phone: 1-877-71-GROOVE

Presales: $15

Subject: {pb-cle} Paul Alexander's ultra mega Doc Martin & Marco Carola pre-sale ticket deal!

Okay folks, here is the deal.

Doc Martin is coming here on April 21st. Less than two weeks away, with live 
vocals by his wife. Pure house music.

Marco Carola is going to be here for our gigantaur Memorial Day event. A 
techno deity.

Pre-sales for each of these events is $15. Door charge for each of these 
events is $20.

How can you save more money?

I am pretty confident these two nights are going to blow your mind, so here 
is how I am going to go broke trying to prove this to you.

For each Doc Martin pre-sale ticket you get, I will take $2 off of a Marco 
Carola ticket.

For every 5 pre-sale tickets sold for ANY event, I will give $2 off each 
ticket sold to you after that.

For every 7 tickets you buy, I give you a FREE ticket!


Where does this money come from? Directly out of my pocket.

Am I an idiot? Yes. Will it be worth it? Hell yes!!

Hit me up ASAP; we do not have unlimited tickets. Both Palm Bar & Privelege 
are not big enough venues for the size of these events!

Italians love badger milk.

It makes great badger cheese for badger pizza!

There is nothing meaner than a deep-dish badger pie!

 ticket deal!

I also wanted to mention - if you are attending Doc Martin, whether by 
presale or paying at the door, yo ucan snag a Carola ticket at the Doc 
Martin show for $10.

That is $25 to see both Doc Martin & Marco Carola.

Anyone who is going to be in town, likes this music, and doesn't take 
advantage of that... is well, not worthy of the badger.

Subject: {pb-cle} WOODY McBRIDE aka Dj ESP!!! Friday, May 4th @ METROPOLIS (PGH) - ONLY $5

On Friday, May 4th, Double Crown Productions, along
with Drop-A-Log are proud to present the Pittsburgh
return of legendary techno pioneer DJ ESP aka Woody
McBride. This extraordinary evening of electronic DJ
talent will be held at Metropolis nightclub, 1900
Smallman Street in the Strip District from 9 p.m.  2
a.m. Opening sets by Pittsburgh natives Breakbeat
Militia (Moose, Zone & Clevr), Kelly Carter, DJ
Underground and Dr. Jones. 

McBrides lead-by-example message of natural living, a
raw food diet and drug free existence is inspirational
to many post-rave adults today. Through his multimedia
label Communiqué, McBride aims to remain in step
providing amusement, wit, human assistance, a positive
example in the music businesss realm of
self-discovery and to offer engaging spiritual music 
vision. In May 2007, ESP will release his new
full-length mix album of original material   The
Think For Yourself LP/CD/DVD. His Pittsburgh
appearance will be a sneak peek at what hes been up
to.

Through the rave scenes heyday in the 1990s, McBride
became a staple of the dance music scene through his
mind-blowing techno sets, which take dancers on an
emotional and spiritual journey of self-discovery
through dance and visual stimulation. His
international playbill today includes Asia, Germany,
France, Austria, South America and all across North
America. In addition, some of the largest scale
Midwest rave events can be attributed to McBride,
including Stairway to Headphones, Electric Disco,
Further, and the unforgettable Turned On events, which
brought together over 7,000 people to celebrate
electronic music in a drug free environment.

While 7,000 attendees are not expected to file through
the doors of Metropolis on Friday, May 4th, an
uplifting and transcendent experience is guaranteed.

This event is 21+ with proper identification required.
Cover charge $5.
@ Metropolis on 1900-1906 Smallman street. (the old

Subject: {pb-cle} demf looking for volunteers

Calling all Volunteers!

Greetings,

Callilng all volunteers for Movement 2007! It takes a lot of volunteers 
to make this huge event run smoothly. As a volunteer, you will play a 
critical role in producing this weekend long event.

Being a Movement volunteer puts you in the middle of all of the action 
and excitement from the initial volunteer meetings to the actual 
festival. It also gives you the opportunity to hear some of the best 
electronic music from around the world.

All festival volunteers will receive:

* An exclusive pass to certain Festival after parties
* A Movement volunteer event t-shirt
* Free admission to the Festival
* Complimentary meal for each day of volunteering
* An unforgettable experience!

All volunteers are required to attend one of two Volunteer Informational 
Meetings. These meetings will be held in a room underneath the main bowl 
at Hart Plaza in Detroit. During these meetings you will meet festival 
staff, learn about your duties as a volunteer and be assigned your 
position(s)/shift(s). Both meetings will be held on a Saturday between 
the hours of 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM. Please refer to the below meeting 
schedules for details. To register as a volunteer, you must be at least 
18 years of age and you must have a valid photo id.


Volunteer Informational Meeting Schedules:

Saturday, April 14, 2007  Meeting #1
1:00pm to 2:15pm = First names beginning A-I
2:30pm to 3:45pm = First names beginning J-O
4:00pm to 5:00pm = First names beginning P-Z

OR

Saturday, May 5, 2007  Meeting # 2
1:00pm to 2:15pm = First names beginning A-I
2:30pm to 3:45pm = First names beginning J-O
4:00pm to 5:00pm = First names beginning P-Z

General areas of volunteering are listed below. However, please note 
that actual placement for volunteer work in any of the below listed 
areas will be based on space availability and will not occur until after 
a short interview at one of the volunteer meetings.


General Volunteer Work Areas

We are looking forward to seeing you at one of the meetings!

noise? what are you talking about? the images that matter don't have 
any noise.  THe crap snapshots in almost total darkness without 
flash? The first bunch were shot at ISO 1000, the last bunch were 
shot underexposed at ISO 3200 on a professional canon EOS1d, no 
camera exists that doesn't have noise at ISO 3200, especially if it 
is undexposed. haha.  A prosumer camera couldn't even take those 
pictures.  They don't make many (if any) prosumer cameras with ISO 
above 400 but I wouldn't know,  because I only shoot pro gear.  If i 
cared about the snapshots, I could remove the noise, but i'm working 
on developing my tentacle porn portfolio and I have to get back to 
violating young girls with large metal dryer hoses.

Went to Much Luv before going to Snuggle.  Had a good time.  Pictures
didn't come out too well IMO, but still good I think.

Much Luv:
http://parties.vrillusions.com/gallery/v/2007-04-14-muchluv/

Snuggle:
http://parties.vrillusions.com/gallery/v/2007-04-14-snuggle/


For those curious, gallery 2 has been working good so far, especially
now that it's on a server I don't have to worry about the CPU
overheating on :) .  The sorting is throwing me off though.  The default
sort puts new albums at the end, which obviously isn't correct.  But if
I say make the latest item first, that gets carried over to the
individual items in new albums I create.  So right now when I create a
new album I have to tell it afterwards to use the default sorting method
again :/ .

Also noticed I must have forgot to check the "use filename as title"
when importing from old gallery, so all of the older pictures don't have
a title. That's why the random picture doesn't show a title for 99% of
the pictures, because there isn't one.  Debating on if it looks better
without title or if I should work some SQL magic and fix the titles of
all of them.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Apr 20                       DOC MARTIN                       Cleveland

Friday April 20, 2007

Doc Martin Sublevel featuring live PA from Lillia

Opening set by Spacin' Jason

Residents Graph and Mike Metz upstairs. 

The legendary Doc Martin is perhaps the West Coast.s first superstar DJ, 
a globetrotter whose residencies have included the finest dance clubs of 
the last two decades . New York.s Twilo and Tunnel and London.s Fabric. 
Despite Martin.s VIP status overseas, however, the turntable veteran 
with nearly 20 years of vinyl performance holds Los Angeles underground 
events as the highest ideal of the dance-music experience.

While most star DJ's are one-note musicians sticking to a single 
subgenera of music, Doc' s live sets bring many styles of music as well 
as people together. In this age of specialized formats among DJ's and 
producers, what sets Martin apart from his peers is his ability to spin 
everything from deep house, acid, funk, tribal, and classics in a set, 
while having it all make sense. Doc is one of the most sought after DJs 
in America.

Sat Apr 21                       DOC MARTIN                      Pittsburgh

Palm Saturdays & Humanaut are proud to present a very special evening 
with Doc Martin.

Doc Martin began his mission on the decks back in the summer of 1986. 
His focus on house music from the land of funk and disco was triggered 
while playing the club and warehouse scene in San Francisco. As one of 
the major players in laying the foundations of a strong West Coast dance 
scene, Doc has always been a master of mixing the crowd with the music. 
Neatly avoiding pigeonholing while embracing a myriad of different 
styles, his sets create a warm unique vibe of empathy on the dance 
floor. Doc.s legendary 8 hour sets from Flammable Liquid, Sunday Love, 
underground lofts and warehouse parties knew no colors, age or sexual 
orientation. He regularly devastated dance floors at the prestigious 
Twilo in New York (rest in peace) and continues to do so today behind 
the decks of the world's most infamous clubs such as London's Fabric and 
New York's Cielo.

The Humanaut, first of his name, would like to invite you to yet another 
evening of upfront, forward-thinking dance music at Palm Bar. The 
experience may just change your face.

300 PRESALE TICKETS AVAILABLE
Purchase your presales from any Humanaut member, www.groovetickets.com, 
or directly from Palm Bar (ask the bartenders).

Sat Apr 21                     JESSICA PARTIN                     Cleveland

Jessica Partin - Houston, TX
 
The ongoing love affair between electronic dance music and Jessica 
Partin began in 1996, at a time when her roots were firmly planted in 
the underground Houston punk music scene, singing lead vocals in a band 
at local venues and teaching her self to play bass guitar on the side. 
Upon exposure to house and techno, along with the concept of continuous 
mixing, Jessica quickly shifted her musical ambitions and began carving 
her own niche in the DJ world characterized by eclectic record 
selection, bold mixing techniques, and an ever-evolving style that 
breaks the barriers between genre distinctions.

With a solid history of DJ performances and residencies at notable clubs 
throughout the city, Jessica currently heads up The New Pop Consortium 
at The Mink (bi-monthly). She has made multiple appearances on 
'MK-ULTRA', the legendary Houston electronic music radio program, mixing 
live over the airwaves for listeners and in May 2006, she made her 
Proton Radio debut as a Featured Artist with exclusive mixes that also 
received airtime on Ibiza Global Radio 97.6 FM (Ibiza, Spain). In 
addition to previous experience playing at Spundae engagements alongside 
top international talent, Jessica has opened for world class DJs such as 
Baby Anne, Randall Jones, DJ Sulli, DJ Hyper, Fairmont (aka Jake 
Fairley), and Ryan Crosson (aka Berg Nixon) and continues to be a 
frequent guest DJ at some of Houston's best events, including the 
all-female DJ rendezvous, 'Les Femmes de la Nuit', 'Crossroads', 
'Rotate', 'Tastylick', and 'Choice', to name a few.

Her style can be described as a fusion of dirty electro-tinged house and 
funky minimal techno with a retro dance-punk edge but spans everything 
broadly from house and tech house to electro and techno. Inspired by 
what she identifies with, the foremost influence on Jessica's sound is 
where she has been. Music has become a living scrapbook of the places 
that she loves and with each record, a memory is shared through sonic 
waves, taking listeners across the world without ever leaving the dance 
floor.

With a hunger that can no longer be satiated on music consumption alone, 
Jessica Partin has entered the foray of producer and is currently 
working on original recordings and a collaboration project, with future 
plans of remix work and the incorporation of live vocals.

Someone Else & Miskate!

Date May 18th

$10


Someone Else - Philly / Berlin
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork] [Fuzzy Box]
Someone Else is formally from Philadelphia but is now Berlin's Sean
O'Neal, co-founder of the tuning spork and fuzzy box record labels.
o'neal's production skills are garnering respect among internationally
renowned djs and labels alike, as reflected by his releases and
remixes on musik krause, tuning spork, foundsound, mo's ferry,
microcosm, nummer and many others. a stalwart of philadephia's deep
house, minimal techno and experimental communities, o'neal also
co-organized various events, hosting performances by magda, matthew
dear, sammy dee, geoff white, jeff milligan, dan bell, dinky, and many
others. his current occupations focus on running foundsound and
unfoundsound records. he comes from a musical family. his grandfather
was a high school music teacher and also played bass with bill hailey
and the comets. his father was also in various rock bands throughout
the '50s and '60s. since 1994, o'neal has been the force behind his
ever-evolving, kitsch-driven electro-pop outfit, flowchart --
releasing dozens and dozens of albums, singles, eps and comp tracks on
different labels from all over the world. he holds several
dj-residencies in philly and continues to spin and play live all
around the country and world -- such as russia, argentina, chile,
uruguay, spain, england, switzerland, germany, france, italy,
slovakia, canada, and most major american cities.


Miskate
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork]
Also moving to Berlin this summer and originally a Pittsburgh DJ, Kate
held down residencies at Laga, Zythos, and was co-founder of Savitri
Sundays. She received a degree in Anthropology (and a minor in Music)
at University of Pittsburgh--where she also participated in a gamelan
ensemble. Her interests in sound began at a young age--first playing
violin, then piano, then guitar, now sample-based electronics (often
incorporating her own singing voice among other found sounds). Her
regular bookings playing deep, minimal house and techno encouraged her
move to Philadelphia in summer 2001. After relocating, she has taken
responsibilities as co-organizer of both the Pitchspork monthly
(hosting names like Magda, Matthew Dear, Sammy Dee, Geoff White, Jeff
Milligan and others) and the Foundsound record label. Her production
debut came in May 2004 with the release of "rip it cookie muenster"
(foundsound01), featuring a remix by Matthew Dear.

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nr : alec?

Just the one in Jea's head. They're common. It's fun to glue them  
together with the rest of the conversation :)

It's a recording of alec baldwin berating his 11 year old daughter...  
kinda twisted. I think it's most twisted that he just went on... and  
on... and on...

then went on larry king and said how he's a slave to his daughter, it  
just goes downhill.

While looking at clips related to this, I found a clip a Law & Order  
episode that has a fake anna nicole smith and a fake... stern what's  
his name. the great part is that david cross plays stern. http:// 
link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid285859616/bclid294430730/ 
bctid769453046

All I can think about when I see that guy is Run Ronnie Run.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri May 04                      WOODY MCBRIDE                    Pittsburgh

On Friday, May 4th, Double Crown Productions, along
with Drop-A-Log are proud to present the Pittsburgh
return of legendary techno pioneer DJ ESP aka Woody
McBride. This extraordinary evening of electronic DJ
talent will be held at Metropolis nightclub, 1900
Smallman Street in the Strip District from 9 p.m. . 2
a.m. Opening sets by Pittsburgh natives Breakbeat
Militia (Moose, Zone & Clevr), Kelly Carter, DJ
Underground and Dr. Jones.

McBride.s lead-by-example message of natural living, a
raw food diet and drug free existence is inspirational
to many post-rave adults today. Through his multimedia
label Communiqué, McBride aims .to remain in step
providing amusement, wit, human assistance, a positive
example in the music business.s realm of
self-discovery and to offer engaging spiritual music .
vision.. In May 2007, ESP will release his new
full-length mix album of original material .  The
Think For Yourself LP/CD/DVD. His Pittsburgh
appearance will be a sneak peek at what he.s been up
to.

Through the rave scenes heyday in the 1990.s, McBride
became a staple of the dance music scene through his
mind-blowing techno sets, which take dancers on an
emotional and spiritual journey of self-discovery
through dance and visual stimulation. His
international playbill today includes Asia, Germany,
France, Austria, South America and all across North
America. In addition, some of the largest scale
Midwest rave events can be attributed to McBride,
including Stairway to Headphones, Electric Disco,
Further, and the unforgettable Turned On events, which
brought together over 7,000 people to celebrate
electronic music in a drug free environment.

While 7,000 attendees are not expected to file through
the doors of Metropolis on Friday, May 4th, an
uplifting and transcendent experience is guaranteed.

This event is 21+ with proper identification required.
Cover charge $5.

We got a super special event lined up for you on Fri May 18th
Tek-Know for it's one year anniversary in conjunction with Kompakt
Distribution, Tuning Spork and un/Foundsound records brings to the
AK........
Someone Else & Miskate!

Date May 18th
9pm - 2:30am
2 Floors of massive goodness
$10


Someone Else - Philly / Berlin
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork] [Fuzzy Box]
Someone Else is formally from Philadelphia but is now Berlin's Sean
O'Neal, co-founder of the tuning spork and fuzzy box record labels.
o'neal's production skills are garnering respect among internationally
renowned djs and labels alike, as reflected by his releases and
remixes on musik krause, tuning spork, foundsound, mo's ferry,
microcosm, nummer and many others. a stalwart of philadephia's deep
house, minimal techno and experimental communities, o'neal also
co-organized various events, hosting performances by magda, matthew
dear, sammy dee, geoff white, jeff milligan, dan bell, dinky, and many
others. his current occupations focus on running foundsound and
unfoundsound records. he comes from a musical family. his grandfather
was a high school music teacher and also played bass with bill hailey
and the comets. his father was also in various rock bands throughout
the '50s and '60s. since 1994, o'neal has been the force behind his
ever-evolving, kitsch-driven electro-pop outfit, flowchart --
releasing dozens and dozens of albums, singles, eps and comp tracks on
different labels from all over the world. he holds several
dj-residencies in philly and continues to spin and play live all
around the country and world -- such as russia, argentina, chile,
uruguay, spain, england, switzerland, germany, france, italy,
slovakia, canada, and most major american cities.


Miskate
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork]
Also moving to Berlin this summer and originally a Pittsburgh DJ, Kate
held down residencies at Laga, Zythos, and was co-founder of Savitri
Sundays. She received a degree in Anthropology (and a minor in Music)
at University of Pittsburgh--where she also participated in a gamelan
ensemble. Her interests in sound began at a young age--first playing
violin, then piano, then guitar, now sample-based electronics (often
incorporating her own singing voice among other found sounds). Her
regular bookings playing deep, minimal house and techno encouraged her
move to Philadelphia in summer 2001. After relocating, she has taken
responsibilities as co-organizer of both the Pitchspork monthly
(hosting names like Magda, Matthew Dear, Sammy Dee, Geoff White, Jeff
Milligan and others) and the Foundsound record label. Her production
debut came in May 2004 with the release of "rip it cookie muenster"
(foundsound01), featuring a remix by Matthew Dear.

influential and pioneering techno and electronic artists.

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters

House, Trance, Drum'n'Bass, Hardstyle, etc.

Local DJs are bringing it back together for an all electronic music 
night every Sunday night, starting Dec. 4, at the Spy in Downtown 
Cleveland's Warehouse District. Explicit Productions (Old School, 
Columbus) has come out of hibernation and into Cleveland to produce a No 
Bullshit, scene supporting, killer club night at one of Clevelands best 
venues for a great sunday of bangin' beats.

We're bringing in some Fresh Blood with some hot new resident DJs. You 
might not have heard of them, but you Definitely need to hear them. 
Check out:
DJ Howse Mowse
DJ Jason Damman
DJ Spyral
Robert Van Helsing
These guys are talented, spin some great music, and are down with the 
program to bring together a killer club night without a fifteen dollar 
cover. Moonshine will have a $5.00 cover ($8.00 for ages 18-20). We will 
bring in guest DJs. We will bring in special acts. We will try our 
damndest to do it all without raising the cover charge.

EXP043 - HALFADDER - ROBOTS WILL LOVE RELIGION EP
http://www.experimedia.net/page.php?id=126
Halfadder's debut EP Robots Will Love Religion is just an initial taste of
whats to come from Ohio's new master of modern day techno. Glitched out and
drenched in bass, this four tracker surprises with its surprising yet
cohesive twists and turns.  Found sound drums and effects create a truly
original techno sound which is a hard thing to come by these days.  Watch
for more from Halfadder and his other projects in the very near future.
Fantastic artwork from Witchbeam.

EXPCD001 - JEREMY BIBLE - I AM VERY UNCOMFORTABLE MOST OF THE TIME
http://www.experimedia.net/page.php?id=127
Ohio based collective, Experimedia, known for its diverse net-label catalog,
events, and Molotov Records vinyl imprint, expands its repertoire by
introducing its hard-copy cd catalog with its first release limited and
numbered to 350.  After three years in the making, this first release guides
the listener through a seamless and diverse spectrum of deeply processed
electronic, acoustic, and found sounds.  Dissonant atmospheres are
complimented by layered field recordings with touches of
electro/hip-hop/industrial influenced beats and bass throughout.  This album
takes the listener through feelings of melancholy and distance and is best
experienced seamlessly beginning to end.  First ten orders will receive a
free limited printed cd copy of Halfadder's Robots Will Love Religion EP.

Subject: {pb-cle} Anyone from the burgh going to Psyberry Fields?

My poor unemployed and probably drunk ass needs a ride.  Will trade a 
ride for biting sarcasm on the trip and possibly an impromptu photo shoot.

Jaded? Who's jaded?
