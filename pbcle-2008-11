Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} KRAFTY KUTS @ Altar Bar - Friday, November 14th

http://i284.photobucket.com/albums/ll13/djclevr/KraftyKuts-WEB1-1.jpg

Krafty Kuts, can truly be recognised as a member of the breakbeat elite. An=
d along with other high profile figures such as Adam Freeland, Rennie Pilgr=
em, Freq Nasty and the Plump DJs, Krafty Kuts has been instrumental in push=
ing the breakbeat sound to a world-wide audience.

In 2006 in released the critically acclaimed =E2=80=9CFreakshow=E2=80=9D al=
bum on Against The Grain with massive singles such as =E2=80=9CBass Phenome=
non=E2=80=9D with Tim Deluxe and =E2=80=9CTell Me How You Feel=E2=80=9D.=20

He has been voted Best International DJ at the Australian Dance Music Award=
s, the Face Of Breakbeat (2003) and Best DJ (2005 and 2006) at the Internat=
ional Breakspoll Awards, Best Breaks DJ at the M8 awards (2006) in Ibiza, B=
est Mini Mix on Annie Mac=E2=80=99s radio 1 show. These continue to be grea=
t accolades for his efforts. However, this success didn=E2=80=99t come over=
night.

Krafty Kuts=E2=80=99 first ventures on the wheels of steel occurred in the =
mid 80=E2=80=99s when he was bitten by the hip-hop and electro bug. It was =
during this period that he developed his cutting and scratching skills, whi=
ch are now a trademark of his party rocking sets.

While Krafty Kuts was smashing it with his DJ skills, he also found time to=
 release his own music. In 1996 he was signed to FSUK, one of the Ministry =
Of Sound=E2=80=99s offshoot labels. 3 EP=E2=80=99s were released to critica=
l acclaim, as well as =E2=80=98Gimme The Funk=E2=80=99; a one-off release f=
or Fatboy Slim=E2=80=99s label Southern Fried that was hammered by every DJ=
 worth their salt.

The success of these releases led to Krafty Kuts becoming one of the most h=
ighly demanded remixers within the UK dance music scene. Today, the list of=
 people Krafty Kuts has remixed for reads like an who=E2=80=99s who of the =
music world, including the likes of Jurassic 5, Utah Saints, Dead Prez, Fat=
boy Slim, Afrika Bambaata, Arthur Baker, Eric B & Rakim and the Classic =E2=
=80=98Humanoid=E2=80=99 by Stakker Humanoid. His remixing talents were ceme=
nted at the 2003 International Breakspoll Awards, where he won Best Remix f=
or Afrika Bambaataa=E2=80=99s =E2=80=98Funky Heroes=E2=80=99.

As well as dishing out killer remixes, he=E2=80=99s also managed to compile=
 =E2=80=98Slam The Breaks On=E2=80=99 1 & 2, both classic overviews of the =
breakbeat sound. Look out for his Fabric Live mix CD coming soon.

Whilst producing and remixing, Krafty Kuts also managed to maintain his Dji=
ng commitments the world over, playing alongside such luminaries as Fatboy =
Slim, The Freestylers, Jungle Brothers, Scratch Perverts, Roni Size and Arm=
and Van Helden.

At present, Krafty Kuts is enjoying success in many areas. To date, his mus=
ic has been used for a Coca-Cola advert, Playstation 2 and PS3 games and fo=
r Guy Ritchie=E2=80=99s film =E2=80=98Mean Machine=E2=80=99. His club night=
 Supercharged, co-promoted with fellow breakbeat crusader Skool Of Thought,=
 is still rammed every week and is widely regarded by many of the scenes bi=
g players as having been instrumental in pushing the breakbeat sound to a w=
ider audience.=20

not mentioning it at all could worse than being anti-drug since you
don't know WHAT his position is.


On a somewhat related note we got 4, yes 4 robocalls from politicians
yesterday.  And those are just the ones that left messages on answering

No he isn't worse. I do know his position on different issues.
My phone has rang 2-10 times everyday for the last month. Guess they are
exempt from the do not call list. Everyone of them that blew up my phone
lost my vote.

We hang up on the robo-callers. We gladly speak to live people.

Saturday my mom and boyfriend and I were all doing major yard work in my
mom's front yard (I was extremely sweaty sawing limbs off trees, and had
sawdust in my hair) when an Obama van pulled up. The people who jumped out
walked right up to me and my mom and asked if we were Amanda Yesko and Gay
Yager. That was a little weird. After assuring them that we were indeed
voting tomorrow, they stuck around and chatted a bit. Apparently, our
Hudson neighborhood is chock full of McCain supporters and we're an
anomaly not only in our neighborhood but in Hudson in general. (My
boyfriend jokes that he keeps waiting for the city of Hudson to finally
kick my family out, since over the years we've grown more and more
liberal, anti-police, and pro-civil liberties to include most things you
can think of so long as they don't interfere with our lives, etc).

It'll be interesting to see how long the lines are at the Hudson library
tomorrow before work. We're getting there right when the polls open at
6:30 but still expect to be late to work.

Amanda

Subject: {pb-cle} voting question

My mom keeps thinking I'm not going to be able to vote because my license
is suspended until November 5th. (I do still have the license in my
possession so of course I was planning on using it as my identifcation).

Anyway, I tell her that's hogwash since there is no way those polling
people are going to hold up the lines and call in every single person's
license to make sure they are valid.

She's wrong, right? I read online that we can use utility bills to prove
who we are, but I don't pay any utilities. I also do not receive a bank
statement via mail, and my paystub does not have my address on it. I
either get to use my suspended driver's license or I don't vote, I guess.

Subject: {pb-cle} beware fake misleading board of elections calls and literature

This is an urgent note to all voters.
I've been volunteering and canvassing for the election over the past
month...and everyday for the past week....last night I started hearing
from citizens that they had been receiving misleading robo-calls
falsely telling them their voting location has been changed. We also
have sources that there are plans to distribute fake flyers with this
disinformation as well.

Similar reports are coming in from Virginia.
"A fake flyer claiming it is from the State Board of Elections has
been circulating, stating that Republican Party supporters shall vote
on November 4 and Democratic Party supporters shall vote on November

If you receive anything to give you any doubts about your voting
location or voting day call your board of elections directly to report
these misleading calls and flyers!!!

I give exactly 1/2 a shit about the failed "Rave Act" from 8 or so years

I got in trouble because of Richard Nixon's War on Drugs. Neither
Obama nor McCain are going to do anything about that.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members

Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

I just have to go the record one more time as stating you guys might as well
just vote Republican if voting for a ticket with Biden on it. By the way I
have been registered and have voted all Democrat my whole life. This year
was the final straw I'm done playing 2 party bullshit. I'm only voting for
Attorney General tommorow. Fuck the rest of them. Here you go read some more
about your "liberal" buddy Biden.

anyone who posts the phrase "anyone who posts the phrase" is a strong
mast-debator.

it's sarcasm.  i have a obama 08 bumper sticker (thanks moveon!).  i'm
voting for obama because this election has given me no real opportunity to
vote for bob barr, who i really would prefer of all the 'major' candidates,
but that doesnt matter.

relevance is posting any of this to a rave list, which obviously will have a
liberal slant.  it's like preaching about civil rights within the walls of
guantanamo bay.  sure you feel all warm and fuzzy, but it's the fucking
choir, bro.

Subject: {pb-cle} ridiculous, uneducated rant...

I watched this rant... he was all over the place and it was very difficult to stomach but I watched it and I really don't even know where to begin with this. The one thing he said that sticks in my craw as total bs is his claim that lots of 'small' businesses make over $250,000, and those making less are... I believe he said "tiny". That lots and lots of people should "bend over" because they are gonna get screwed. RIDICULOUS.

I work at a very well established and very prosperous electric car/scooter/bicycle rental place. It is the largest and the oldest vehicle rental business in town. It is a HUGE lot, with hundreds of rental vehicles and is located right on Duval Street, which is THE street here in Key West. The value of the lot, and the company itself exceeds $45 million dollars. The owner has several bank accounts with large sums of money in them... $900,000 - 500,000, etc. And yet still, the average yearly profit is only about $200,000. And I use the word 'only' very loosely here, because $200,000 a year profit sounds pretty damn sweet to me.

Another thing that bothers me about everyone freaking out about taxes is this - (and trust me LOTS of people don't understand this) lets say you own a business and you make $300,000 for the fiscal year. You will ONLY be taxed at the higher rate for $50,000 of those dollars... you do not move into a higher bracket for ALL of the money you made, you would be taxed at the lower rate for the first $250,000 and at the higher rate for anything over that amount. I'm amazed at the ignorance of small/medium business owners who don't even realize this, or at least don't take this into consideration when they criticize Obama's plan on capital gains taxes.

I could go on and on. There is a hell of a lot more at stake than taxes. If you like senseless war, vote for McCain. If you are anti-abortion, vote McCain and then see how many dumpster babies and bloody coat hangers turn up when he stocks the supreme court with right wing zealots. If you think alienating the entire world and basically shitting on diplomacy is sound foreign policy, vote McCain. If you want a vice president who is so far in over her head, and is backing up a 72 year old man who could very realistically not live 4 more years, vote McCain.

This is why I spent all day canvassing this town today and will be missing work tomorrow to go to the local Obama office and work the phones well into the night. BECAUSE I DONT WANT THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN AND NONE OF YOU SHOULD EITHER. Please go vote and consider ALL the issues when you do.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ridiculous, uneducated rant...

People don't seem to understand the difference between how much money
you take in... and how much is profit.  You're taxed on your profits,
not on the cash-in of your business.  If you're making more than
250k/y in take-home cash, it's kind of hard to relate to you, and
there really aren't too many people doing as well as you are.

I'm very aware of "members of this list that are victims of the war on
drugs". Forgive me for those of you whom I'm friends with, but I see no case
if you were actually at fault and knew what you were doing. Most of the
people I know involved in this, aren't battling some sort of "pain" and out
sourcing for the cure. BUT, that leads onto a different debate...

carry on.

Thank god for intelligent life. This election will also act as survey
of Intelligent vs. Ignorant Americans.  Here is hoping we tip the
scales towards the intelligent direction finally.

Subject: {pb-cle} reasonably pleasant voting experience

I waited about 30 minutes before an election volunteer told me that the
line for my precinct had become empty and I could cut to the front. I was
given an optical scan ballot just like the ones we used to take tests on
back in school. After filling in the black circles I fed my ballot into a
machine that counted it right there. I was the 57th person to have voted
at that location this morning. Couldn't have been pleasanter. I feel bad
for the people who had to wait in longer lines!

Yesterday a caller asked me if I knew that my voting location was at the Old Stone Church in Cleveland.  I have lived in PA going on 4 years and am a registered voter in PA. I have sent back numerous mailers with my change of address and have even called them directly to have them update it in the system.  Apparently no matter what I do Cuyahoga County still thinks I am a registered voter of Ohio.  Does this mean I can go to Cleveland and vote as well?  Would they catch it?  There's definetly a problem here.

This could be an identity theft scam or it could be an election
manipulation tactic.

we had a choice between paper or electronic ballots.  The paper ones
didn't look like they were scannable but maybe I just couldn't get a
good view of them.  It then looked like they just put the ballot in an
envelope and drop it in a box, not scanned or anything.  So I just went
with the electronic one.  took like an hour and 15 mins to vote, and
this was around 10:00 am or so.  although I think part of that is our
precinct is like 1/4 of streetstucky (yeah, it's streetstucky, but
still).  There were 3 other precincts here and all of them had little or
no lines. :/ meh, o well.

ohhhkay, am i missing something?

without even trying to argue whose tax policy is more productive, there are 
HUGE holes in your rant.

coming from completely educated point of view, 

1 - None of the numbers you threw together there make a lick of sense in the 
whole context of your story and only serve to confuse people.

2 - You really don't have a clue about how taxes & money flow out of a 
business works as evidenced by your statment regarding how you say capital gains are 
taxed.  Serious question - Do you know the difference between C Corp and S 
Corp earnings? Or, how about partnership income & how it flows through to an 
individual tax return? Schedule C income?  Business Income versus Dividends or 
Capital Gains?  Or how about W-2 wages? Surely you know how each of those are 
taxed, and how each would affects a companies and owners tax position?

3 -  I am completely amazed that you think small business owners are so dumb, 
as to not know were their expenses are going.  The ones that dont know were 
their $$ is going are the ones that don't make it, and don't stay small 
buisness owners for very long.

4 - Again regarding your "ignorant small business owner comment" - what is 
more likely, 1 - someone invest their life savings into making self boss dream a 
reality and then doesn't even bother to educate themselves (or pay someone 
educated) to control one of thier biggest expenses (Taxes), or 2 - that you 
really don't have any clue and just lashed out randomly at some made up group of 
people to try make your argument coherent in your own head.

5 - Serious question #2 -  How many small business owners do your really 
know? (Im talking real business with real employees, not some dude in his mom's 
basement selling shit on ebay) Because in order to make a broad generalizations 
about the intellect of small business owners, I would think it should be safe 
to  assume that you have extensive experience in dealing with them on a level 
that would permit you to get an insight into their actual business knowledge 
and thus, make an effective judgement upon it.

5 - It's painfully obvious that no one is paying you to make any kind of 
substantial financial decisions for the company that you work for.

-g


ps - i cant believe i just put this much effort into justifying this nonsense 
with a response.

are HUGE holes in your rant.
<BR>
<BR>coming from completely educated point of view,=20
<BR>
<BR>1 - None of the numbers you threw together there make a lick of sense in=
 the whole context of your story and only serve to confuse people.
<BR>
<BR>2 - You really don't have a clue about how taxes &amp; money flow out of=
 a business works as evidenced by your statment regarding how you say capita=
l gains are taxed. &nbsp;Serious question - Do you know the difference betwe=
en C Corp and S Corp earnings? Or, how about partnership income &amp; how it=
 flows through to an individual tax return? Schedule C income? &nbsp;Busines=
s Income versus Dividends or Capital Gains? &nbsp;Or how about W-2 wages? Su=
rely you know how each of those are taxed, and how each would affects a comp=
anies and owners tax position?
<BR>
<BR>3 - &nbsp;I am completely amazed that you think small business owners ar=
e so dumb, as to not know were their expenses are going. &nbsp;The ones that=
 dont know were their $$ is going are the ones that don't make it, and don't=
 stay small buisness owners for very long.
<BR>
<BR>4 - Again regarding your "ignorant small business owner comment" - what=20=
is more likely, 1 - someone invest their life savings into making self boss=20=
dream a reality and then doesn't even bother to educate themselves (or pay s=
omeone educated) to control one of thier biggest expenses (Taxes), or 2 - th=
at you really don't have any clue and just lashed out randomly at some made=20=
up group of people to try make your argument coherent in your own head.
<BR>
<BR>5 - Serious question #2 - &nbsp;How many small business owners do your r=
eally know? (Im talking real business with real employees, not some dude in=20=
his mom's basement selling shit on ebay) Because in order to make a broad ge=
neralizations about the intellect of small business owners, I would think it=
 should be safe to &nbsp;assume that you have extensive experience in dealin=
g with them on a level that would permit you to get an insight into their ac=
tual business knowledge and thus, make an effective judgement upon it.
<BR>
<BR>5 - It's painfully obvious that no one is paying you to make any kind of=
 substantial financial decisions for the company that you work for.
<BR>
<BR>-g
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>ps - i cant believe i just put this much effort into justifying this non=
sense with a response.=20

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

Sat Nov 08                  TOTAL REQUEST RAVE 3                    Toronto

Toronto is home to many talented DJs, many fine promoters, and many

community apart as one of the world's best is YOU - the enthusiastic, 
passionate, PLURry, and downright amazing ravers who come together each 
event to build something special. We at NC and Embedded recognize how 
lucky we are to have such an incredible group of people around us, and 
that's why every year, we give you an event to truly call your own,

Fri Nov 14                       KRAFTY KUTS                     Pittsburgh

Krafty Kuts, can truly be recognised as a member of the breakbeat elite. 
And along with other high profile figures such as Adam Freeland, Rennie 
Pilgrem, Freq Nasty and the Plump DJs, Krafty Kuts has been instrumental 
in pushing the breakbeat sound to a world-wide audience.

In 2006 in released the critically acclaimed .Freakshow. album on 
Against The Grain with massive singles such as .Bass Phenomenon. with 
Tim Deluxe and .Tell Me How You Feel..

He has been voted Best International DJ at the Australian Dance Music 
Awards, the Face Of Breakbeat (2003) and Best DJ (2005 and 2006) at the 
International Breakspoll Awards, Best Breaks DJ at the M8 awards (2006) 
in Ibiza, Best Mini Mix on Annie Mac.s radio 1 show. These continue to 
be great accolades for his efforts. However, this success didn.t come 
overnight.

Krafty Kuts. first ventures on the wheels of steel occurred in the mid 
80.s when he was bitten by the hip-hop and electro bug. It was during 
this period that he developed his cutting and scratching skills, which 
are now a trademark of his party rocking sets.

While Krafty Kuts was smashing it with his DJ skills, he also found time 
to release his own music. In 1996 he was signed to FSUK, one of the 
Ministry Of Sound.s offshoot labels. 3 EP.s were released to critical 
acclaim, as well as .Gimme The Funk.; a one-off release for Fatboy 
Slim.s label Southern Fried that was hammered by every DJ worth their 
salt.

The success of these releases led to Krafty Kuts becoming one of the 
most highly demanded remixers within the UK dance music scene. Today, 
the list of people Krafty Kuts has remixed for reads like an who.s who 
of the music world, including the likes of Jurassic 5, Utah Saints, Dead 
Prez, Fatboy Slim, Afrika Bambaata, Arthur Baker, Eric B & Rakim and the 
Classic .Humanoid. by Stakker Humanoid. His remixing talents were 
cemented at the 2003 International Breakspoll Awards, where he won Best 
Remix for Afrika Bambaataa.s .Funky Heroes..

As well as dishing out killer remixes, he.s also managed to compile 
.Slam The Breaks On. 1 & 2, both classic overviews of the breakbeat 
sound. Look out for his Fabric Live mix CD coming soon.

Whilst producing and remixing, Krafty Kuts also managed to maintain his 
Djing commitments the world over, playing alongside such luminaries as 
Fatboy Slim, The Freestylers, Jungle Brothers, Scratch Perverts, Roni 
Size and Armand Van Helden.

At present, Krafty Kuts is enjoying success in many areas. To date, his 
music has been used for a Coca-Cola advert, Playstation 2 and PS3 games 
and for Guy Ritchie.s film .Mean Machine.. His club night Supercharged, 
co-promoted with fellow breakbeat crusader Skool Of Thought, is still 
rammed every week and is widely regarded by many of the scenes big 
players as having been instrumental in pushing the breakbeat sound to a 
wider audience.

about

E-SIX & ROAN ( FIRST LIVE A/V DUO )
Emerging from scenes seemingly worlds apart though identical in passion, 
virtuosity and cultural influence, Emilio Abadia and Matt Roan form what 
is possibly the most innovative and engaging DJ duo to infiltrate the 
Windy City. A drive to isolate, capture, cut-up and then synthesize 
moments of both sonic and visual art mark the experience of one of their 
performances. Their sets, which are as meticulously curated as a gallery 
show and involve DVD clips edited to a click track, have resulted in a 
very respected event: Dance Party Magic, produced under the banner of 
their company Crossfader King. In individual sets, Abadia, known as 
E-Six, and Roan bring elements of their divergent musical backgrounds to 
the fore, adding unique options to Chicago clubbers apart from their 
visual and audio mash-ups. Each a relentless selector, E-Six and DJ Matt 
Roan are the perfect purveyors of your party experience.

Originally hailing from Daytona Beach, Florida, E-Six was a prominent 
promoter in the post-punk and hardcore rock scenes. He simultaneously 
absorbed many other musical movements of the time, including electronica 
at old-school raves, dirty South hip-hop, Miami bass and the more 
slickly produced sounds of beachside clubs. This schizophrenic 
appreciation resulted in what E-Six calls his .rock-any-kind-of-crowd 
music,. melding original remixes, bass-drenched club rap, electronic 
bangers, rock gems, .80s and .90s breaks and international underground.

Chicago native Roan got his chops in the classically trained realm, 
studying piano, guitar and drums from the age of eight onward. Four 
indie records, a stint at Lollapalooza and several club residencies 
later, his beat master prowess has surpassed the various DJs he watched 
in awe at the Northside Puma store he once managed. By teasing 
partygoers with a carefully constructed wall of atmospheric choices from 
across the map, E-Six and DJ Matt Roan are a club experience akin to 
champagne and truffles at an abandoned warehouse party: completely 
unexpected.

DETROIT TECHNO MILITIA
2x4 DJ Seoul & T.Linder
[www.detroittechnomilitia.com]
-2008 Rustbelt Tour-

Detroit Techno Militia is a record label and a grass roots DJ/Producer 
collective dedicated to preserving the legacy of true Detroit electronic 
music and its proliferation around the world.

Similar to the restoration of historic architecture; we are not tearing 
down and building anew. Rather using the existing structure as a basis 
for our own endeavors. Detroit has always had much to offer musically 
and it is our mission to make it known to the rest of the world for 
generations to come.

As owner and co-founder of Bang Tech 12, DJ Seoul has been tearing up 
the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule that 
has taken him to literally thousands of events across North America. 
Including the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, which he considers a 
career highlight.

Here are some links to listen to some tunes as well:

Kit is $350 (yeah, it's a build-your-own thing).  Says only one chip is
surface mount so maybe even my weak soldering skills could do it.  May
make one just to see if i can.  then if I get bored just put the sucker
on eBay... PROFIT!

http://www.ladyada.net/make/x0xb0x/samples.html has some samples.  The
top comparison ones suck.  Second section has a couple high quality
mp3's one side is x0xb0x, other is an original 303.  And if you want to
see it in action:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6oz-WO-oaQ

x0x, 303, and 909 :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} x0xb0x (opensource TB-303 clone)

These things are aweeeeeeeeesomeeee.  acid like CRAZY

The kits are incredibly long wait to get ahold of, like 1 year+++ if
you get on the waiting list now

They not only sound perfect, but the knobs are really easy to tweak on
unlike a real tb-303, and there's a ton of extra stuff it can do
that's extremely useful.  I made a youtube of one I sold showing a
bunch of features:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkmtKMUKO1A


I have built 8 and have one on ebay right now with snazzy plexiglass
panel set....

http://cgi.ebay.com/x0xb0x-TB-303-analog-Acid-Bassline-MIDI-Custom-NEW_W0QQitemZ320316442474QQcmdZViewItemQQptZKeyboards_MIDI?hash=item320316442474&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1416%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318


If you want to build one and do not want to wait 1 year (or forever,
the kits may be retired), the only real choice is to source all the
parts yourself.  I have enough of the rarest parts to build literally
like 95 more, which I probably won't get to in this lifetime.. happy
to sell you enough to build yours if you decide to do it

The surface mount part isn't impossible or anything, my first one was
my first time soldering SMD parts and I had a broken iron and it
worked great.. all the ones since were on a pro iron and tip and have
worked the same but are much cleaner :)


I considered selling kits, but they go on ebay for like $600-650 so I
can't justify selling them any cheaper than that.  Happy to sell a kit
for that though, with presoldered surface mount part, since I do
actually have a complete set of parts for one sitting unassembled on
my workbench

It's funny, I've been looking to buy a few things from adafruit.com lately anyway, and now my wish list just got a lot longer.

Every play with an arduino?

Subject: {pb-cle} just one more NRR response I promise!!!


<<without even trying to argue whose tax policy is more productive, there are HUGE holes in your rant.>>

Isn't
that the the whole entire point of this discussion - what really
matters??? Why even discuss this further if you just breeze right by
the main point of contention? We are comparing plans here - why won't
you? Are the holes in my rant even half the size of that drivel I
watched on youtube?

<<1 - None of the numbers
<<you threw together there make a lick of sense in the whole context of
<<your story and only serve to confuse people.>>

First
of all, it's pretty difficult to respond to this without really knowing
what, in your opinion makes no sense - I assume you question how the
owner has been able to become so wealthy without making such huge
profits each year. The short answer is that the place has been
profitable for 30 consecutive years - the value of the property has
increased substantially over the years before leveling off recently
(the actual business itself - offices, vehicles, etc. is less than a
quarter of the overall worth.) He has also invested very wisely and is
honestly the biggest tightwad I have ever seen in my life. LOL. Oh, btw
- he is a moderate Republican who voted for President Elect Obama,
because even HE realizes money isn't everything.

<<2 - You really don't have a
clue about how taxes & money flow out of a business works as
evidenced by your <<statment regarding how you say capital gains are
taxed.  Serious question - Do you know the difference between <<C Corp
and S Corp earnings? Or, how about partnership income & how it
flows through to an individual tax return? <<Schedule C income?  Business
Income versus Dividends or Capital Gains?  Or how about W-2 wages?
Surely <<you know how each of those are taxed, and how each would affects
a companies and owners tax position? >>

I most certainly DO NOT understand the intricacies of all the elements you mention... not by a longshot and will absolutely admit you are most certainly FAR more educated and knowledgeable about taxation. I have no formal education in this field, why do you think I am working where I do? I do have family that has been employed at H&R Block for decades. I have discussed the plans of each candidate as thoroughly as possible with them. The way Capital Gains are taxed was explained to me by my grandmother who has worked for Block since the 60's... perhaps I misunderstood her or things have been lost in the translation.

<<3 -  I am completely amazed
that you think small business owners are so dumb, as to not know were
their <<expenses are going.  The ones that dont know were their $$ is
going are the ones that don't make it, and don't <<stay small buisness
owners for very long. 
<<
<<4 - Again regarding your "ignorant small business owner comment" -
what is more likely, 1 - someone invest their <<life savings into making
self boss dream a reality and then doesn't even bother to educate
themselves (or pay <<someone educated) to control one of thier biggest
expenses (Taxes), or 2 - that you really don't have any clue <<and just
lashed out randomly at some made up group of people to try make your
argument coherent in your own <<head. 

<<5 - Serious question #2 -  How many small business owners do your
really know? (Im talking real business with <<real employees, not some
dude in his mom's basement selling shit on ebay) Because in order to
make a broad <<generalizations about the intellect of small business
owners, I would think it should be safe to  assume that you <<have
extensive experience in dealing with them on a level that would permit
you to get an insight into their actual <<business knowledge and thus,
make an effective judgement upon it.>>

A half dozen or so. Mostly other smaller rental companies who have about 6 employees and profits around $100,000 a year, and a friend of mine, die hard Republican who owns a small NAPA auto repair service who is literally FREAKING OUT because McCain lost. No, I am not 'making up' anything and I am NOT saying all of these companies have ignorant owners at all... thus the word SOME in my statement. SOME NOT ALL. Huge difference. But when I hear SOME of them saying things like they will be giving 64% of their profits to the gov't.... or they are moving to Costa Rica because they are going to be taxed so heavily and unfairly then I am of the opinion that they are pretty damn uninformed and do not understand Obama's ideas. I sense you are offended because you own a small business and take my comments personally. DON'T. I give you props because you know your stuff... unlike SOME of the few I just mentioned, and unlike myself as well. Which is also why I would
 love to hear your opinion on which plan is better and would really love to hear who you voted for and why, and how much of your decision is based on finance and not other issues - ie. foreign policy, abortion, health care, etc...

The election is over. The right person won. I have at least a modicum of faith in my gov't. now. If Obama is ineffective and makes mistakes I will be the first one to crack on him, but I am personally giving him at least 2 years to get things heading in positive directions. As I sit here I am watching the stock market struggle mightily, and am worried... I have Stephen Moore on my TV saying Obama needs to make a speech IMMEDIATELY to calm investors about Capital Gains Tax issues. So I am worried, but am still convinced I voted correctly.

I don't wanna make Trout mad so maybe any rebuttals should be sent to my inbox and I welcome discussion on this topic and all other things politically important over the weeks/months to come.

Subject: {pb-cle} work out music?

I've been going to the gym a lot lately, and if you know me, this is a
really good thing. I suppose even if you don't, it's a good thing for
anyone. I've been doing my cardio to Chris Liebing's Evolution
(American Madness, etc), what other suggestions do y'all yinzers and
otherwise have?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ridiculous, uneducated rant...

Oddly enough, this is something that has been bouncing around in my
head for a while now. While I've read that there's some super high
percentage that says what your parents vote, you will vote, it's still
not high enough to make things like Nebraska (Warren Buffet Land) make
sense. It would seem to me as there is some kind of perfect formula
that could be reached given enough time and thought. A year and a half
ago, I nearly thought that McCain had it down pat actually, it's the
minority of people which are the majority of republicans that threw it
off for him completely. That and given the current economic status of
America that made the perfect storm happen.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a tree humping liberal, I just understand that
there's a combination of items into moderation that make someone
electable.

Where I get confused isn't how a large portion of Americans believe
anything that comes through the fox news machine (OBAMA IS A
COMMUNIST!), it isn't voting values -- it's voting what ultimately is
what matches their thoughts on an personal and familial level.

No one, I repeat NO ONE, treats abortion like birth control. No parent
wants their child to go off to Iraq. There's some sort of gap where
people are abstracted from the common feelings of others, something
that didn't happen when our founding fathers founded this great
nation. Back then, people had to stop and talk to people, people
didn't randomly have tourettwitter moments. Society was closer, the
major differences between us were smaller deals.

Now, back to the original topic. What makes people vote Republican?
Really? Am I wrong in thinking that people aren't that dumb?

Dumb people that think they are liberals voted for Obama. He has droped the
ball on every choice he has made so far begining with VP. So now he has
picked  Rohm Emanuel as his main man. Leftists liberals and labor hate that
guy for pushsing NAFTA through. What do you think a Zionist feels about
invading Iraq and Iran? LOL some change!! He is really changing Washington
by picking all the same assholes! Do you really think a hawaian career
poltician knows anything about working people / middle class? Silly ravers
brainwashed by sound bites. When will you learn all they do bullshit and
tell you what you want to hear.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ridiculous, uneducated rant...

Oh dear, this is where I jump and say that I'm a tree-humping liberal too
... but having heard people bitch about NAFTA for the past many years I
concluded the other day that it was just fine. So a lot of Americans lost
their jobs to the Mexicans. Philosophically, is this really all that bad?
Why do Americans think we have some sort of manifest-destiny right to have
better lives than people in other countries?

The Mexicans have every bit as much a right to quality of life than we do,
and if certain jobs are gone now -- well, that's what new technology is
for.

But enough about Mexico.

The people in Ecuador have it damn shitty. I've been there a couple times.
The "nice" part of Quito is still a fucking hole and the "bad" part of
town is nowhere anyone wants to be. My mother started an importing
business a few years ago to try and help those poor people - you know, put
some money into their economy and allow a few of them to to send their
kids to school. But you know how hard this is to live in America and
import goods from Ecuador? Because we grow cotton and such in this
country, the US wants to make it as ridiculously expensive as possible to
import any cotton goods from Ecuador. So they tax the living hell out of
anything my mom wants to ship here - so much so that it's cheaper just to
buy our own crap. (Or our own cheap shit from China, of course). A shirt
that cost a couple bucks down in Ecuador suddenly goes up to $25-30 by the
time my mom's paid off that waste of a job known as a "customs agent" up
at the airport, who's little more than a highly paid tax collector.

Meanwhile, the people of Ecuador are still living in poverty that "poor"
Americans could not understand without they see it firsthand. Free trade
could turn the entire country of Ecuador around. And I refuse to consider
such an idea a "bad thing."

If Mexico's got all the good jobs - maybe I should move there.

saw someone selling one the other day for 900$ or trade for something. i 
think it was computer controlled on AHOT.

but with it being open source and all, you can make your own boards, get 
parts at newark or mouser and make/sell your own?

1. get idea to profit

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} x0xb0x (opensource TB-303 clone)

Yeah -

Most of the transistors and the op amps/vca's are way long out of
production.  The only thing limiting x0xb0x kit runs are these parts.
They're always available (we are in the internet age after all), but
are typically REALLY expensive

You need a 2sc2291 which is always available on ebay.. for $25.  When
it was new it was like $1 of course...  The 2sc2291 is the limiting
factor on putting out more kits though, straight from ladyada limor's
mouth.  You can't substitute, or you'll end up with a crappy sounding
filter

This is why I snagged a big sack of 100 a bit ago :)  And why I am
happy to sell to people in need

I would sell them for like $10 plus ship I guess, which seems more reasonable

I want to sit down and see what I could sell every transistor and
vca/opamp for as a package.  I see that offered for $100 and doesn't
include everything I would, I think it would be more like $80
shipped... i'll check whenever someone actually cares :)

i just realized this is somewhat a great discussion to ask around for
someone who is a good electrical engineering type that might be able to work
on an amplifier i have...

I have a vintage Marantz Model 1200 amplifier which one channel doesnt work
on, anyone know of someone who could fix this for me?  this thing sounds so
sweet out of one channel that i want to get the second channel fixed and use
it as my monitor amp...

any recommendations are appreciated, preferably in pittsburgh area or within
an hour or pittsburgh... but would also consider bringing it to cleveland
area in holiday time when i'm visiting family...

I listened to this during my workout yesterday and was loving it.
Its a Z-trip special Obama mix with lots of "get you pumped up because this week kicked ass" tracks;)
And the Bush quote mash-up over the Benny Hill theme is pretty awesome too.

I've been going to the gym a lot lately, and if you know me, this is a
really good thing. I suppose even if you don't, it's a good thing for
anyone. I've been doing my cardio to Chris Liebing's Evolution
(American Madness, etc), what other suggestions do y'all yinzers and
otherwise have?

For those that are interested, I decided to see how much the non-rare compo=
nents would cost to buy individually from mouser, digikey, etc.=A0 I includ=
ed the adafruit PCB's and panels and a couple other things, and fudged the =
numbers on the hardware.. but the total came out to just over $250.=A0 Add =
in shipping, and the cost of the rare stuff, I can't imagine there's much m=
arkup on the $350 kit...

If the kit becomes available again.. or maybe she'd sell it without the 2sc=
2291..

I would sell them for like $10 plus ship I guess, which seems more reasonab=

I want to sit down and see what I could sell every transistor and
vca/opamp for as a package.  I see that offered for $100 and doesn't
include everything I would, I think it would be more like $80
shipped... i'll check whenever someone actually cares :)

I listened to this during my workout yesterday and was loving it.
Its a Z-trip special Obama mix with lots of "get you pumped up because this=
 week kicked ass" tracks;)

And the Bush quote mash-up over the Benny Hill theme is pretty awesome too.

I've been going to the gym a lot lately, and if you know me, this is a

really good thing. I suppose even if you don't, it's a good thing for
anyone. I've been doing my cardio to Chris Liebing's
 Evolution
(American Madness, etc), what other suggestions do y'all yinzers and
otherwise have?

Pendulum's newer album - In Silico - is pretty damn energetic stuff.   
High Contrast's 2003 essential mix is also really good dnb, IMHO.

That said, tuning out to some Younger Brother while running is where  
it's at.

Hmmmmmm

First party = 1992
First DJ gig = 1993
Started "disco night" at annies in cinci = 1994??

Moved to Miami and layer low = 95,96

Back to Cleveland in 1997

Selekta = 1998 - 2008

Moved to Chicago at end of 99. Fought the city of Chicago's race  
law... Threw parties in the park on the city's dime

And then the club scene took over and I decided that it wasn't my thing.

I much preferred when music fans sought out a good time as opposed to  
showing up at the same lame bar every Friday night

I'm old. I'm cranky. I'm meek.

Subject: {pb-cle} favorite new albums of the week (nov12)

These two new compilations (my top picks of the week) from two new
labels are absolutely fantastic and they play great back to back.  You
will find many of the same artists on both of these
compilations...with both the label founders, ryonkt and segue, being
on each other's compilations along many other major players on current
ambient scene including celer, chubby wolf, cloudburst, corey fuller,
crossroads ego, elian, entia non, glenn ryszko, ian hawgood, ijo,
offthesky, pawn, porzellan, russel garden, shunji takami, son of rose.
 Its interesting to see how the modern ambient scene is coming
together with many of these artists releasing on the same labels such
as Resting Bell, Infraction, Dragon's Eye, Data Obscura, and
Experimedia.  A great little family of artists coming together and
crossing over.

various artists - sounds of slow flow vol1 - From Ryonkt's new label
Slow Flow Rec out of Sapporo, Japan.
various artists - listen - From Segue's new label out of Washington D.C.

//
And here a few other fantastic new titles.

eluder - the most beautiful blue - from the Infraction label probably
the leading label of the current ambient scene...and just across town
from Experimedia headquarters.  I was excited to find both of us, two
labels from little Canton, Ohio on Textura.org's 10 favorite labels of
2008 list.

steinbr=FCchel - home - another beautiful piece of work from
steinbr=FCchel on the Slaapwel label with some wonderfull packaging (a
small cardboard box with stitched on artwork)
amplifier machine - her mouth is an outlaw - new release on 12k

taylor deupree & kenneth kirschner - may - brand new from Room40

tujiko noriko, lawrence english & john chantler - u - another new
release from Room40

lawrence english - kiri no oto - Lawrence English's fantastic album on Touc=
h.

richard garet - l'avenir - Really enjoying the work of Richard Garet
and the Winds Measure label is a recent discovery that has just blown
me away and great packaging.  (Lawrence English has another really
great album on Winds Measure as well)

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Nov 14                       KRAFTY KUTS                     Pittsburgh

Krafty Kuts, can truly be recognised as a member of the breakbeat elite. 
And along with other high profile figures such as Adam Freeland, Rennie 
Pilgrem, Freq Nasty and the Plump DJs, Krafty Kuts has been instrumental 
in pushing the breakbeat sound to a world-wide audience.

In 2006 in released the critically acclaimed .Freakshow. album on 
Against The Grain with massive singles such as .Bass Phenomenon. with 
Tim Deluxe and .Tell Me How You Feel..

He has been voted Best International DJ at the Australian Dance Music 
Awards, the Face Of Breakbeat (2003) and Best DJ (2005 and 2006) at the 
International Breakspoll Awards, Best Breaks DJ at the M8 awards (2006) 
in Ibiza, Best Mini Mix on Annie Mac.s radio 1 show. These continue to 
be great accolades for his efforts. However, this success didn.t come 
overnight.

Krafty Kuts. first ventures on the wheels of steel occurred in the mid 
80.s when he was bitten by the hip-hop and electro bug. It was during 
this period that he developed his cutting and scratching skills, which 
are now a trademark of his party rocking sets.

While Krafty Kuts was smashing it with his DJ skills, he also found time 
to release his own music. In 1996 he was signed to FSUK, one of the 
Ministry Of Sound.s offshoot labels. 3 EP.s were released to critical 
acclaim, as well as .Gimme The Funk.; a one-off release for Fatboy 
Slim.s label Southern Fried that was hammered by every DJ worth their 
salt.

The success of these releases led to Krafty Kuts becoming one of the 
most highly demanded remixers within the UK dance music scene. Today, 
the list of people Krafty Kuts has remixed for reads like an who.s who 
of the music world, including the likes of Jurassic 5, Utah Saints, Dead 
Prez, Fatboy Slim, Afrika Bambaata, Arthur Baker, Eric B & Rakim and the 
Classic .Humanoid. by Stakker Humanoid. His remixing talents were 
cemented at the 2003 International Breakspoll Awards, where he won Best 
Remix for Afrika Bambaataa.s .Funky Heroes..

As well as dishing out killer remixes, he.s also managed to compile 
.Slam The Breaks On. 1 & 2, both classic overviews of the breakbeat 
sound. Look out for his Fabric Live mix CD coming soon.

Whilst producing and remixing, Krafty Kuts also managed to maintain his 
Djing commitments the world over, playing alongside such luminaries as 
Fatboy Slim, The Freestylers, Jungle Brothers, Scratch Perverts, Roni 
Size and Armand Van Helden.

At present, Krafty Kuts is enjoying success in many areas. To date, his 
music has been used for a Coca-Cola advert, Playstation 2 and PS3 games 
and for Guy Ritchie.s film .Mean Machine.. His club night Supercharged, 
co-promoted with fellow breakbeat crusader Skool Of Thought, is still 
rammed every week and is widely regarded by many of the scenes big 
players as having been instrumental in pushing the breakbeat sound to a 
wider audience.

about

E-SIX & ROAN ( FIRST LIVE A/V DUO )
Emerging from scenes seemingly worlds apart though identical in passion, 
virtuosity and cultural influence, Emilio Abadia and Matt Roan form what 
is possibly the most innovative and engaging DJ duo to infiltrate the 
Windy City. A drive to isolate, capture, cut-up and then synthesize 
moments of both sonic and visual art mark the experience of one of their 
performances. Their sets, which are as meticulously curated as a gallery 
show and involve DVD clips edited to a click track, have resulted in a 
very respected event: Dance Party Magic, produced under the banner of 
their company Crossfader King. In individual sets, Abadia, known as 
E-Six, and Roan bring elements of their divergent musical backgrounds to 
the fore, adding unique options to Chicago clubbers apart from their 
visual and audio mash-ups. Each a relentless selector, E-Six and DJ Matt 
Roan are the perfect purveyors of your party experience.

Originally hailing from Daytona Beach, Florida, E-Six was a prominent 
promoter in the post-punk and hardcore rock scenes. He simultaneously 
absorbed many other musical movements of the time, including electronica 
at old-school raves, dirty South hip-hop, Miami bass and the more 
slickly produced sounds of beachside clubs. This schizophrenic 
appreciation resulted in what E-Six calls his .rock-any-kind-of-crowd 
music,. melding original remixes, bass-drenched club rap, electronic 
bangers, rock gems, .80s and .90s breaks and international underground.

Chicago native Roan got his chops in the classically trained realm, 
studying piano, guitar and drums from the age of eight onward. Four 
indie records, a stint at Lollapalooza and several club residencies 
later, his beat master prowess has surpassed the various DJs he watched 
in awe at the Northside Puma store he once managed. By teasing 
partygoers with a carefully constructed wall of atmospheric choices from 
across the map, E-Six and DJ Matt Roan are a club experience akin to 
champagne and truffles at an abandoned warehouse party: completely 
unexpected.

DETROIT TECHNO MILITIA
2x4 DJ Seoul & T.Linder
[www.detroittechnomilitia.com]
-2008 Rustbelt Tour-

Detroit Techno Militia is a record label and a grass roots DJ/Producer 
collective dedicated to preserving the legacy of true Detroit electronic 
music and its proliferation around the world.

Similar to the restoration of historic architecture; we are not tearing 
down and building anew. Rather using the existing structure as a basis 
for our own endeavors. Detroit has always had much to offer musically 
and it is our mission to make it known to the rest of the world for 
generations to come.

As owner and co-founder of Bang Tech 12, DJ Seoul has been tearing up 
the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule that 
has taken him to literally thousands of events across North America. 
Including the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, which he considers a 
career highlight.

Here are some links to listen to some tunes as well:

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

about

E-SIX & ROAN ( FIRST LIVE A/V DUO )
Emerging from scenes seemingly worlds apart though identical in passion, 
virtuosity and cultural influence, Emilio Abadia and Matt Roan form what 
is possibly the most innovative and engaging DJ duo to infiltrate the 
Windy City. A drive to isolate, capture, cut-up and then synthesize 
moments of both sonic and visual art mark the experience of one of their 
performances. Their sets, which are as meticulously curated as a gallery 
show and involve DVD clips edited to a click track, have resulted in a 
very respected event: Dance Party Magic, produced under the banner of 
their company Crossfader King. In individual sets, Abadia, known as 
E-Six, and Roan bring elements of their divergent musical backgrounds to 
the fore, adding unique options to Chicago clubbers apart from their 
visual and audio mash-ups. Each a relentless selector, E-Six and DJ Matt 
Roan are the perfect purveyors of your party experience.

Originally hailing from Daytona Beach, Florida, E-Six was a prominent 
promoter in the post-punk and hardcore rock scenes. He simultaneously 
absorbed many other musical movements of the time, including electronica 
at old-school raves, dirty South hip-hop, Miami bass and the more 
slickly produced sounds of beachside clubs. This schizophrenic 
appreciation resulted in what E-Six calls his .rock-any-kind-of-crowd 
music,. melding original remixes, bass-drenched club rap, electronic 
bangers, rock gems, .80s and .90s breaks and international underground.

Chicago native Roan got his chops in the classically trained realm, 
studying piano, guitar and drums from the age of eight onward. Four 
indie records, a stint at Lollapalooza and several club residencies 
later, his beat master prowess has surpassed the various DJs he watched 
in awe at the Northside Puma store he once managed. By teasing 
partygoers with a carefully constructed wall of atmospheric choices from 
across the map, E-Six and DJ Matt Roan are a club experience akin to 
champagne and truffles at an abandoned warehouse party: completely 
unexpected.

DETROIT TECHNO MILITIA
2x4 DJ Seoul & T.Linder
[www.detroittechnomilitia.com]
-2008 Rustbelt Tour-

Detroit Techno Militia is a record label and a grass roots DJ/Producer 
collective dedicated to preserving the legacy of true Detroit electronic 
music and its proliferation around the world.

Similar to the restoration of historic architecture; we are not tearing 
down and building anew. Rather using the existing structure as a basis 
for our own endeavors. Detroit has always had much to offer musically 
and it is our mission to make it known to the rest of the world for 
generations to come.

As owner and co-founder of Bang Tech 12, DJ Seoul has been tearing up 
the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule that 
has taken him to literally thousands of events across North America. 
Including the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, which he considers a 
career highlight.

Here are some links to listen to some tunes as well:

Satch is probably one of the most technically skilled guitarists alive
who still has some soul to what he plays.  A+++.  Crystal Planet was
the album on when I got clocked ridiculously above the speed limit.
Oops.

exp049
archangle - http://www.arch-angle.net
all over the psychedelicatessence
released november 15th, 2008

Experimedia.net presents All Over The Psychedelicatessence is the new
album by Australian sound artist Josh Wodak (aka Archangle). Here is
what the artist had to say about this fantastic album.

"I recently famished an album made over the last seven years with a
variety of guilty collaborators and innocent bystanders in Australia
and India. Being bout foods for the imagination, its called 'all over
the psychedelicatessence' and features the car smash hit single
nucleotide polymorphism 'bangers n mashed pot:ato prac:tice pi:ece
with side dose of delhi belly' - like sounds sound like gullivers
anatomical travels through the psychedelicious good grub gulliver
while it digests the gastronomical smorgasbored of petty boojwas...
The 10 tracks (total duration 45 mins) are highly eclectic, but also
stylistically similar, oscillating between improv, experimental,
electroacoustic, ambient, post-folk, noise, sound-art, glitch and
electronica...which rolled together I call 'eclectrictronica' coz it
rolls right off the tongue. A smorgabored of acoustic+electronic
instruments were used, which were subject to live
editing/mixing/mangling/processing."

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post,
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} exp049 - archangle - all over the psychedelicatessence

This release is free therefore it does not equal spam it also in this
case is not BSP as it is promoting another artist.  I have been
contributing to this community for many many years now locally and
globally.  If there is really an issue with it than I should be banned
because I will continue to post the occasional announcement to this
list in hopes to contribute something positive to the local community
and turn some people onto some fantastic work.  IMO...I am doing the
community a service.  And besides not much happens on this list.

So do you feel I should completely abandon my efforts in the regional
community and focus on the global?  While I do much better in the
global community I do attempt to also contribute to my regional
community.

I think this is obviously a personal reaction on your part to to a
statement I made during the elections about the so called 'Rave Act'
in that I didnt feel it was an issue as there are much more important
global issues at stake.  If I remember correctly before that comment
was made I do believe you were a supporter of my label so now to turn
and attack me based on political statement with which you disagree I
feel is counteractive and uncalled for.  But you can do as you may.

Apologies if my political views rubbed you the wrong way during the
elections.  But this is America and the freedom of choice and free
speech is something that we should all take pride in and be able to
have intelligent and friendly debate without it ruining relationships
or attitudes towards each other.

I wish you all the best,
Jeremy Bible

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

generations to come.

the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

career highlight.

2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip

Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."


JOHN CARPENTER
www.myspace.com/joncarpenter
www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

By Summer 2004, Jon Carpenter found himself in a new setting altogether. 
He and his wife moved to South Korea to spend a year abroad and to see a 
new part of the world. The notion of the frontier theory was forged 
years ago with the idea "Go West Youngman." In the land of the morning 
calm, without any reservations he walked up to one of Seoul.s premiere 
promoters and handed him his demo. As they say "the rest is history!" 
His unselfish nature towards his dance floor has inspired his peers and 
has left clubbers in Korea exhausted after his sets. House music was 
still his main forte' dropping tracks from label's such as Fine Tune, 
Work, Data, Boss, Subliminal, IHR, Slip n Slide, and EyezCream. His days 
of spinning in his home state Pennsylvania are a distant memory, but 
taught him valuable skills that gained him bookings in some of Seoul's 
largest nightclubs.

The year in South Korea extended a few extra months, until moving to 
Belgium in February 2006. Currently in Belgium, with a new cd release 
coming soon, a new online radio show, and beginning the early stages of 
his own production, the future is looking bright. Jon Carpenter is 
reaching his third continent, and he's only getting started. His track 
selection, smooth mixing, and ability to rock the dance floor has become 
popular with clubbers and is quickly gaining more support.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.
also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.=A0 its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post,
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.=A0 YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN

exp049
archangle - http://www.arch-angle.net
all over the psychedelicatessence
released november 15th, 2008

Experimedia.net presents All Over The Psychedelicatessence is the new
album by Australian sound artist Josh Wodak (aka Archangle). Here is
what the artist had to say about this fantastic album.

"I recently famished an album made over the last seven years with a
variety of guilty collaborators and innocent bystanders in Australia
and India. Being bout foods for the imagination, its called 'all over
the psychedelicatessence' and features the car smash hit single
nucleotide polymorphism 'bangers n mashed pot:ato prac:tice pi:ece
with side dose of delhi belly' - like sounds sound like gullivers
anatomical travels through the psychedelicious good grub gulliver
while it digests the gastronomical smorgasbored of petty boojwas...
The 10 tracks (total duration 45 mins) are highly eclectic, but also
stylistically similar, oscillating between improv, experimental,
electroacoustic, ambient, post-folk, noise, sound-art, glitch and
electronica...which rolled together I call 'eclectrictronica' coz it
rolls right off the tongue. A smorgabored of acoustic+electronic
instruments were used, which were subject to live
editing/mixing/mangling/processing."
