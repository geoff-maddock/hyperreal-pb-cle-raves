Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

Someone Else - Philly / Berlin
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork] [Fuzzy Box]
Someone Else is formally from Philadelphia but is now Berlin's Sean
O'Neal, co-founder of the tuning spork and fuzzy box record labels.
o'neal's production skills are garnering respect among internationally
renowned djs and labels alike, as reflected by his releases and
remixes on musik krause, tuning spork, foundsound, mo's ferry,
microcosm, nummer and many others. a stalwart of philadephia's deep
house, minimal techno and experimental communities, o'neal also
co-organized various events, hosting performances by magda, matthew
dear, sammy dee, geoff white, jeff milligan, dan bell, dinky, and many
others. his current occupations focus on running foundsound and
unfoundsound records. he comes from a musical family. his grandfather
was a high school music teacher and also played bass with bill hailey
and the comets. his father was also in various rock bands throughout
the '50s and '60s. since 1994, o'neal has been the force behind his
ever-evolving, kitsch-driven electro-pop outfit, flowchart --
releasing dozens and dozens of albums, singles, eps and comp tracks on
different labels from all over the world. he holds several
dj-residencies in philly and continues to spin and play live all
around the country and world -- such as russia, argentina, chile,
uruguay, spain, england, switzerland, germany, france, italy,
slovakia, canada, and most major american cities.


Miskate
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork]
Also moving to Berlin this summer and originally a Pittsburgh DJ, Kate
held down residencies at Laga, Zythos, and was co-founder of Savitri
Sundays. She received a degree in Anthropology (and a minor in Music)
at University of Pittsburgh--where she also participated in a gamelan
ensemble. Her interests in sound began at a young age--first playing
violin, then piano, then guitar, now sample-based electronics (often
incorporating her own singing voice among other found sounds). Her
regular bookings playing deep, minimal house and techno encouraged her
move to Philadelphia in summer 2001. After relocating, she has taken
responsibilities as co-organizer of both the Pitchspork monthly
(hosting names like Magda, Matthew Dear, Sammy Dee, Geoff White, Jeff
Milligan and others) and the Foundsound record label. Her production
debut came in May 2004 with the release of "rip it cookie muenster"
(foundsound01), featuring a remix by Matthew Dear.

belt (Design, 1000, Zenit, Question, Do.Mi.No) Marco Carola has emerged 
in the last decade to be one of the city's (and Italy.s) most 
influential and pioneering techno and electronic artists.

The Humanaut, first of his name, would like to invite you to an evening 
of upfront, forward-thinking dance music at Privilege. The experience 
may just change your hair-do.

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS

Subject: {pb-cle} annasmellz no more. venue change

personally i'm mixed on this.  the lime spider has a pounding house 
system.  painful at times actually, way better beer selection, better 
food (they still doing late night snacks there?)

buuuutttttttt, as a bar it has no attention span and is quite A.D.D.  as 
in it gets bored and moves on pretty fast to something else.

guess we'll see how things go????

---------------------------------------------------

Re(vision) is moving!!!!!!

That's right...Re(vision) is moving to a new venue.
May marks the one year anniversary of what has been an amazing Wed. 
night in Akron.

Starting on Wed. 5-16 Re(vision) will be taking place on the rooftop 
patio of The Lime Spider in downtown Akron,Ohio. If the weather is bad 
and during the winter months we will be downtstairs inside the club.

Thanks to everyone who has attended Re(vision) for the last year, and 
thank you to all the wonderful dj's who have rocked it. Since taking 
over Wednesdaze the night has really grown into something special.

Changing venues at this point is what I feel must be done in order to 
keep the night going in a positive direction. The Lime Spider will afford
Re(vision) the opportunity to bring in more out of town guests, and the 
chance to do something different.

Wednesday nights at Annabells have been a staple for as long as I can 
remember. It has gone through various promoters and has hosted some 
amazing talent. I love everything it has been...but it is time for a 
change.

Again thank you to all have made this possible. Re(vision) would be just 
another night if it wasn't for your support. I urge you all to tell your 
friends about the move. Admission will still only be 2 dollars, it will 
remain 18+, the sound will be amazing, and we will have some killer 
drink specials as well.

I'm looking forward to seeing everyone out this week for the last
Re(vision) at Annabells.

This week 5-9-07 @ Re(vison)!!!!!!!!!!!

The Lovethang crew meets the Tek-know? crew.

Here's my review...I ran around like a chicken with my head cut off all day
on Saturday, but it was well worth it. I went to Nicole's and transformed
into my psyberry shortcake outfit and psyberlox around 8:00, then got back
to the venue shortly after 9:00 and people were already starting to show up!
Everything went pretty smooth, however the turnout was a little lower than
expected. Every set I heard was great, the sound was great, and everyone
seemed to be having a great time.

One downfall was that I got a call from my parents at about 12:30am saying
that Ian had a fever of over 104 degrees and that he was sweating and
shaking really bad. They said they just gave him some Tylenol before they
called. So I changed out of my little psyberry shortcake outfit (damn), then
Chris and I were off to my mom's. When we got there his temp was about 102.
If it would've still been 104, we would've taken him to the emergency room,
but we just thought it was best just to take him home. On our way home,
Chris said that he really wanted me to go back to the venue so I could spin,
and that he would call me if Ian's fever spiked back up, and we would then
head to the hosptial. His fever fluctuated between 99.7 & 102.2 yesterday.
His temperature was back to normal this morning...yay!

So I got back to the venue at about 2:15 (I was supposed to play from
2-3:30) (Ari & Uzi were spinning in my place), so I hopped on the decks and
took over. Everyone seemed to really enjoy my downtempo psychedelic
breakbeat set!  Benj (who went on after me) said that I could spin a little
longer which was very nice and it worked out for him anyway because we ended
up extending the event to 5:30am (we were going to end at 5:00am originally)


Thank you to all my fellow Goaheads, the rest of the peeps involved with the
event, and everyone who attended!!!!!

Here are some pics (more to come):

Here&#39;s my review...I ran around like a chicken with my head cut off all
day on Saturday, but it was well worth it. I went to Nicole&#39;s and
transformed into my psyberry shortcake outfit and psyberlox around
8:00, then got back to the venue shortly after 9:00 and people were
already starting to show up! Everything went pretty smooth, however the turnout was a little lower
than expected. Every set I heard was great, the sound was great, and
everyone seemed to be having a great time.
<br>
<br>One downfall was that I got a call from my parents at about 12:30am
saying that Ian had a fever of over 104 degrees and that he was
sweating and shaking really bad. They said they just gave him some
Tylenol before they called. So I changed out of my little psyberry
shortcake outfit (damn), then Chris and I were off to my mom&#39;s. When we
got there his temp was about 102. If it would&#39;ve still been 104, we
would&#39;ve taken him to the emergency room, but we just thought it was
best just to take him home. On our way home, Chris said that he really
wanted me to go back to the venue so I could spin, and that he would
call me if Ian&#39;s fever spiked back up, and we would then head to the
hosptial. His fever fluctuated between 99.7 &amp; 102.2 yesterday. His
temperature was back to normal this morning...yay!<br>
<br>So I got back to the venue at about 2:15 (I was supposed to play
from 2-3:30) (Ari &amp; Uzi were spinning in my place), so I hopped on
the decks and took over. Everyone seemed to really enjoy my downtempo
psychedelic breakbeat set!&nbsp;
Benj (who went on after me) said that I could spin a little longer
which was very nice and it worked out for him anyway because we ended
up extending the event to 5:30am (we were going to end at 5:00am
originally) <br>
<br>Thank you to all my fellow Goaheads, the rest of the peeps involved with the event, and everyone who attended!!!!!<br>

buuuutttttttt, as a bar it has no attention span and is quite A.D.D.  as

guess we'll see how things go????

---------------------------------------------------

Re(vision) is moving!!!!!!

That's right...Re(vision) is moving to a new venue.
May marks the one year anniversary of what has been an amazing Wed. 
night in Akron.

Starting on Wed. 5-16 Re(vision) will be taking place on the rooftop 
patio of The Lime Spider in downtown Akron,Ohio. If the weather is bad 
and during the winter months we will be downtstairs inside the club.

Thanks to everyone who has attended Re(vision) for the last year, and 
thank you to all the wonderful dj's who have rocked it. Since taking 
over Wednesdaze the night has really grown into something special.

Changing venues at this point is what I feel must be done in order to 
keep the night going in a positive direction. The Lime Spider will afford
Re(vision) the opportunity to bring in more out of town guests, and the 
chance to do something different.

Wednesday nights at Annabells have been a staple for as long as I can 
remember. It has gone through various promoters and has hosted some 
amazing talent. I love everything it has been...but it is time for a 
change.

Again thank you to all have made this possible. Re(vision) would be just 
another night if it wasn't for your support. I urge you all to tell your 
friends about the move. Admission will still only be 2 dollars, it will 
remain 18+, the sound will be amazing, and we will have some killer 
drink specials as well.

I'm looking forward to seeing everyone out this week for the last
Re(vision) at Annabells.

This week 5-9-07 @ Re(vison)!!!!!!!!!!!

Here&#39;s my review...I ran around like a chicken with my head cut off all
day on Saturday, but it was well worth it. I went to Nicole&#39;s and
transformed into my psyberry shortcake outfit and psyberlox around
8:00, then got back to the venue shortly after 9:00 and people were
already starting to show up! Everything went pretty smooth, however the turnout was a little lower
than expected. Every set I heard was great, the sound was great, and
everyone seemed to be having a great time.
<br>
<br>One downfall was that I got a call from my parents at about 12:30am
saying that Ian had a fever of over 104 degrees and that he was
sweating and shaking really bad. They said they just gave him some
Tylenol before they called. So I changed out of my little psyberry
shortcake outfit (damn), then Chris and I were off to my mom&#39;s. When we
got there his temp was about 102. If it would&#39;ve still been 104, we
would&#39;ve taken him to the emergency room, but we just thought it was
best just to take him home. On our way home, Chris said that he really
wanted me to go back to the venue so I could spin, and that he would
call me if Ian&#39;s fever spiked back up, and we would then head to the
hosptial. His fever fluctuated between 99.7 &amp; 102.2 yesterday. His
temperature was back to normal this morning...yay!<br>
<br>So I got back to the venue at about 2:15 (I was supposed to play
from 2-3:30) (Ari &amp; Uzi were spinning in my place), so I hopped on
the decks and took over. Everyone seemed to really enjoy my downtempo
psychedelic breakbeat set!&nbsp;
Benj (who went on after me) said that I could spin a little longer
which was very nice and it worked out for him anyway because we ended
up extending the event to 5:30am (we were going to end at 5:00am
originally) <br>
<br>Thank you to all my fellow Goaheads, the rest of the peeps involved with the event, and everyone who attended!!!!!<br>

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Someone Else - Philly / Berlin
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork] [Fuzzy Box]
Someone Else is formally from Philadelphia but is now Berlin's Sean
O'Neal, co-founder of the tuning spork and fuzzy box record labels.
o'neal's production skills are garnering respect among internationally
renowned djs and labels alike, as reflected by his releases and
remixes on musik krause, tuning spork, foundsound, mo's ferry,
microcosm, nummer and many others. a stalwart of philadephia's deep
house, minimal techno and experimental communities, o'neal also
co-organized various events, hosting performances by magda, matthew
dear, sammy dee, geoff white, jeff milligan, dan bell, dinky, and many
others. his current occupations focus on running foundsound and
unfoundsound records. he comes from a musical family. his grandfather
was a high school music teacher and also played bass with bill hailey
and the comets. his father was also in various rock bands throughout
the '50s and '60s. since 1994, o'neal has been the force behind his
ever-evolving, kitsch-driven electro-pop outfit, flowchart --
releasing dozens and dozens of albums, singles, eps and comp tracks on
different labels from all over the world. he holds several
dj-residencies in philly and continues to spin and play live all
around the country and world -- such as russia, argentina, chile,
uruguay, spain, england, switzerland, germany, france, italy,
slovakia, canada, and most major american cities.


Miskate
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork]
Also moving to Berlin this summer and originally a Pittsburgh DJ, Kate
held down residencies at Laga, Zythos, and was co-founder of Savitri
Sundays. She received a degree in Anthropology (and a minor in Music)
at University of Pittsburgh--where she also participated in a gamelan
ensemble. Her interests in sound began at a young age--first playing
violin, then piano, then guitar, now sample-based electronics (often
incorporating her own singing voice among other found sounds). Her
regular bookings playing deep, minimal house and techno encouraged her
move to Philadelphia in summer 2001. After relocating, she has taken
responsibilities as co-organizer of both the Pitchspork monthly
(hosting names like Magda, Matthew Dear, Sammy Dee, Geoff White, Jeff
Milligan and others) and the Foundsound record label. Her production
debut came in May 2004 with the release of "rip it cookie muenster"
(foundsound01), featuring a remix by Matthew Dear.

Flyer coming soon...

Steve Simpson, Humanaut and Privilege are proud to present a very 
special evening with Marco Carola.

vast array of production credits and a whole host of labels under his 
belt (Design, 1000, Zenit, Question, Do.Mi.No) Marco Carola has emerged 
in the last decade to be one of the city's (and Italy.s) most 
influential and pioneering techno and electronic artists.

The Humanaut, first of his name, would like to invite you to an evening 
of upfront, forward-thinking dance music at Privilege. The experience 
may just change your hair-do.

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

All New Event! Sunday Nights at Spy Bar
All Electronic Music Party
House, Trance, Drum'n'Bass, Hardstyle, etc.

Local DJs are bringing it back together for an all electronic music 
night every Sunday night, starting Dec. 4, at the Spy in Downtown 
Cleveland's Warehouse District. Explicit Productions (Old School, 
Columbus) has come out of hibernation and into Cleveland to produce a No 
Bullshit, scene supporting, killer club night at one of Clevelands best 
venues for a great sunday of bangin' beats.

We're bringing in some Fresh Blood with some hot new resident DJs. You 
might not have heard of them, but you Definitely need to hear them. 
Check out:
DJ Howse Mowse
DJ Jason Damman
DJ Spyral
Robert Van Helsing
These guys are talented, spin some great music, and are down with the 
program to bring together a killer club night without a fifteen dollar 
cover. Moonshine will have a $5.00 cover ($8.00 for ages 18-20). We will 
bring in guest DJs. We will bring in special acts. We will try our 
damndest to do it all without raising the cover charge.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and

We got a super special event lined up for you on Fri May 18th
Tek-Know for it's one year anniversary in conjunction with Kompakt
Distribution, Tuning Spork and un/Foundsound records brings to the
AK........
Someone Else & Miskate!

Date May 18th
9pm - 2:30am
2 Floors of massive goodness
$10


Someone Else - Philly / Berlin
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork] [Fuzzy Box]
Someone Else is formally from Philadelphia but is now Berlin's Sean
O'Neal, co-founder of the tuning spork and fuzzy box record labels.
o'neal's production skills are garnering respect among internationally
renowned djs and labels alike, as reflected by his releases and
remixes on musik krause, tuning spork, foundsound, mo's ferry,
microcosm, nummer and many others. a stalwart of philadephia's deep
house, minimal techno and experimental communities, o'neal also
co-organized various events, hosting performances by magda, matthew
dear, sammy dee, geoff white, jeff milligan, dan bell, dinky, and many
others. his current occupations focus on running foundsound and
unfoundsound records. he comes from a musical family. his grandfather
was a high school music teacher and also played bass with bill hailey
and the comets. his father was also in various rock bands throughout
the '50s and '60s. since 1994, o'neal has been the force behind his
ever-evolving, kitsch-driven electro-pop outfit, flowchart --
releasing dozens and dozens of albums, singles, eps and comp tracks on
different labels from all over the world. he holds several
dj-residencies in philly and continues to spin and play live all
around the country and world -- such as russia, argentina, chile,
uruguay, spain, england, switzerland, germany, france, italy,
slovakia, canada, and most major american cities.


Miskate
[un/found sound] [Tuning Spork]
Also moving to Berlin this summer and originally a Pittsburgh DJ, Kate
held down residencies at Laga, Zythos, and was co-founder of Savitri
Sundays. She received a degree in Anthropology (and a minor in Music)
at University of Pittsburgh--where she also participated in a gamelan
ensemble. Her interests in sound began at a young age--first playing
violin, then piano, then guitar, now sample-based electronics (often
incorporating her own singing voice among other found sounds). Her
regular bookings playing deep, minimal house and techno encouraged her
move to Philadelphia in summer 2001. After relocating, she has taken
responsibilities as co-organizer of both the Pitchspork monthly
(hosting names like Magda, Matthew Dear, Sammy Dee, Geoff White, Jeff
Milligan and others) and the Foundsound record label. Her production
debut came in May 2004 with the release of "rip it cookie muenster"
(foundsound01), featuring a remix by Matthew Dear.

Having set the bar in Cleveland in the 90's and early 00's, with his 
signature Tech-House & Techno blends based around pitch-shifting 
theories, Darwin was on a path of destruction and reconstruction that 
lead him to numerous clubs and venues across the US. Residing in the 
mountains of Colorado, his theories may have turned into chaos. Welcome 
back this Cleveland native for a unforgettable return into darkness.

Sun May 27                      MARCO CAROLA                     Pittsburgh

Flyer coming soon...

Steve Simpson, Humanaut and Privilege are proud to present a very 
special evening with Marco Carola.

Now firmly established as one of the world.s premier techno DJs, the 
young Marco Carola could never have dreamed what laid ahead of him when 
sneaking into Neapolitan discotheques at the tender age of 13. With a 
vast array of production credits and a whole host of labels under his 
belt (Design, 1000, Zenit, Question, Do.Mi.No) Marco Carola has emerged 
in the last decade to be one of the city's (and Italy.s) most 
influential and pioneering techno and electronic artists.

The Humanaut, first of his name, would like to invite you to an evening 
of upfront, forward-thinking dance music at Privilege. The experience 
may just change your hair-do.

TICKETS

~ Stone Circle Stage: Psytrance & Progressive Trance ~

AMD
(Nano Records  UK)
Live! First North American appearance!
Presenting AMD, the Psytrance super-group consisting of the two solo 
artists APHID MOON and DICKSTER. With their complementary production 
skills and a shared love of full-on music, they make a formidable force, 
taking Psytrance to a new and exciting place, delivering nothing but 
floor-fillers with huge, multi-layered tracks that keeping building and 
peaking! Having already rocked dancefloors in Brazil, Japan, Europe, and 
the UK, in support of their debut album, Big Fish, we are fortunate to 
have them for their first USA appearance! Get ready all you lovers of 
dance!

DICKSTER / DICK TREVOR
(Nano Records  UK)
Live & DJ sets!
We are truly honored to host a Psytrance legend! DICK TREVOR has been at 
the forefront of the Psytrance scene since its conception -- responsible 
for seminal acts such as GREEN NUNS OF THE REVOLUTION, BUMBLING LOONS, 
SLINKY NUNS, INFERNAL MACHINE, TRICKSTER, BISTO BOYS, GREEN OMS, 
JUMANJI, and currently with DICKSTER and AMD. With unrivaled production 
talent, and countless releases to his name, experience what an 
undeniably experienced artist can do to a dancefloor!

APHID MOON
(Nano Records  UK)
Live! First North American appearance!
Over the last decade, APHID MOON has released on countless Psytrance 
labels and played numerous parties and festivals in Japan, Israel, South 
Africa, Brazil, Europe, and the UK. His hard-driving and infectious 
dance sound made of clear grooves and intense psychedelics stands out of 
the league of full-on you know already. His music is sharp and toxic 
enough to expand your boarders of dance experience - demanding your 
energy to create the dancefloors collective. This is Psychedelic Trance!

HUMAN BLUE
(Transient Records  Sweden)
Live!
Its been eight, long years since HUMAN BLUE first played in Philadelphia 
for GAIAN MIND, and in that time, hes been busy both touring around the 
globe and producing lots of tracks  testing and perfecting his signature 
sound consisting of delicately structured soundscapes, and harmonies 
backed up with a chunky groove. HUMAN BLUE has released five albums in 
his career so far, with a sixth album slated for this summer, and hes 
been licensed to no less then 80 (!) compilations, as well as releasing 
a number of 12 vinyl releases. Prepare yourself for what is sure to be a 
most memorable morning session!

LOOPUS IN FABULA
(Fabula Records  Italy)
Live!
We are happy to welcome back LOOPUS IN FABULA, who made a remarkable 
surprise appearance at GMSF2004. With three albums to his name, he has 
established a reputation for the funkadelic sound; a mixture of 
mind-twisting Psytrance and funky Disco sounds. Having played almost 
every corner of the world, LOOPUS has developed and perfected a blended, 
live + DJ set with a special task: slowly bringing the dancefloor into a 
relaxed, happy, funky atmosphere full of laughs and funny smiles!

YAB-YUM / GASPARD / AJJA
(Peak Records  Switzerland)
Live & DJ sets! Trance & Downtempo sets! First North American 
appearance!
AJJA and GASPARD, two musicians, two sets of creative energy, influenced 
by each other and fusing into a whole that is greater then the sum of 
its parts. As co-founders of Switzerlands Peak Records, they have their 
fingers on the pulse of the full-power, nighttime sounds. Get ready for 
a colorful nighttime journey filled with futuristic freakiness -- a 
swirling carousel of loops and rhythms, spastic elastic sounds and funky 
leads, balanced by rolling bass-lines and powerful kicks! We proudly 
present the North American debut of YAB-YUM!

PHUTUREPRIMITIVE / TELEPATHIK
(Liquid Records  Portland, OR)
Live & DJ! Downtempo & Trance sets!
PHUTUREPRIMITIVE has become a top artist in the Downtempo/Psy-Chill 
music scene, performing throughout the United States and Europe with his 
fusion of organic and synthetic elements. Musically ranging from 
atmospheric downbeat and Drum n Bass patterns, to ethnic breaks, vocals 
and percussions, to dub and beyond -- creating a landscape of aural 
texture. For a Psytrance project, TELEPATHIK is diverse in its sound, 
sometimes leaning towards a more progressive groove, sometimes melodic, 
while other times diving straight into a full-on driving frenzy -- 
always shifting and changing into new sounds and themes. This is dance 
music that takes both your mind and body on a journey!

LEILA
(Dragonfly Records  UK)
As a veteran of the early Goa scene and the UKs free party culture, 
Leila has played at festivals across Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and Zambia, 
including twice at Samothraki. Her tunes are plucked from a spectrum of 
psychedelia, never too progressive or minimalist. Leila seduces with her 
insistent grooves, funky basslines, and multi-layered melodies, often 
harboring a hard-edged, spring-loaded bite! She may be a waif, but this 
little lady sure packs a punch!

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water

2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM

1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters

I would toneshift the hell out of Breckenridge in the
summer also.  Very limited social life there once the
slopes shut down in April.

here's my nickel version interpretation of what he meant...

if you sit and listen to the same loop over and over, the mind will start to
interpret the sounds you are hearing in different ways, thus the tone is
being shifted.  certain elements of the sound that you are hearing will come
to the forefront of what your brain is focusing on, certain elements will
drop out of focus.  As far as i understood, tempo can even become
disproportionate in that you perceive a slight change in tempo whether
faster or slower.

my gut instinct says he probably smokes a lot of weed. :)

All I remember is being amazed at watching him play on 3 decks at one of

+25 STP for double reply (would have been 50 if I replied to myself)

Forgot to mention that definition is pretty true.  I started to run into
that when I messed with Rebirth and just had the 909 going for a while
in the background while I was messing with getting something to work and
I remember thinking to myself "hey, this sounds different" and think my
computer was messing up.  I've noticed a few other times as well
although I usually don't listen to tracks that have a single 4 beat loop
for the whole track.  Or if I hear mixes there ones like dave clarke
who's swapping records out every minute.

Sucks I can't do both Family Affair *and* this. Well, I guess if FA
doesn't happen for me, I know where I'm going. (I keep thinking, didn't I
used to go to huge parties only a week or two apart? It's camping that
sucks. I need an air-conditioned tent).

air into the tent.  there are 2 weeks between FA6 and WEMF, plenty of

The Legendary family affair festivals that used to bring in crowds from
worldwide is back for a 6th episode. Join us in a remote camping location at
the Southern most tip of Ohio (US) for three days and multiple stages of
music.

http://familyaffairfest.com

Lineup is huge and growing but current highlights are
Underground Resistance Assault DJ's : Detroit : Buzz Bangin Goree aka
Clandestine James Pennington aka Suburban Knight Performing as UR Assault
DJ's ...
Atomic Babies
Gavin Hardkiss
Trevor Lamont

Additionally we (experimedia) will be there contributing a couple live
performances and dj sets including the new collaborative project of Jeremy
Bible and Halfadder...

spec.dev

spec.dev pronounced spec-dot-dev and short for spectral
development (formerly Databasis Basics) is the collaborative effort of
Jason Henry (aka Halfadder) and Jeremy Bible, the duo behind the
eclectic Ohio based international leftfieldist artist collective and
recording label Experimedia Communications. The duo's undefinable and
constantly evolving sound pulls from their diverse influences of techno,
electro, idm, experimental, dub-step, ambient, and hip-hop to explore
uncharted territory. Rumbling bass, breakneck beats, dissonant
atmospherics, incoherent voices, and field recorded environments are
just a few of the characteristics that are likely to shine through
during the duo's live performances. With every liveset unique
however, one can never know what to expect next from the rebellious
electronic
duo. If your looking to treat your ears to new revolutionary sounds then
keep an ear on spec.dev.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

been consistently charted and played by a wide range of top jocks

In addition, he has made appearances on mix CDs from the whos who in 
electronic music like: Antoine Clamaran, Dave Clarke, DJ Dan, DJ Rush, 
Hatiras and John Digweed. Furthermore, Rees co-founded Bunchlox Music as 
well as started two record labels of his own, Jackinthebox and Public 
Housing.

Bunchlox has been an outlet for releasing artists including: Mazi,

Having set the bar in Cleveland in the 90's and early 00's, with his 
signature Tech-House & Techno blends based around pitch-shifting 
theories, Darwin was on a path of destruction and reconstruction that 
lead him to numerous clubs and venues across the US. Residing in the 
mountains of Colorado, his theories may have turned into chaos. Welcome 
back this Cleveland native for a unforgettable return into darkness.

Steve Simpson, Humanaut and Privilege are proud to present a very

vast array of production credits and a whole host of labels under his 
belt (Design, 1000, Zenit, Question, Do.Mi.No) Marco Carola has emerged 
in the last decade to be one of the city's (and Italy.s) most 
influential and pioneering techno and electronic artists.

The Humanaut, first of his name, would like to invite you to an evening 
of upfront, forward-thinking dance music at Privilege. The experience 
may just change your hair-do.

Over the last decade, APHID MOON has released on countless Psytrance 
labels and played numerous parties and festivals in Japan, Israel, South 
Africa, Brazil, Europe, and the UK. His hard-driving and infectious 
dance sound made of clear grooves and intense psychedelics stands out of

HUMAN BLUE
(Transient Records  Sweden)
Live!
Its been eight, long years since HUMAN BLUE first played in Philadelphia 
for GAIAN MIND, and in that time, hes been busy both touring around the 
globe and producing lots of tracks  testing and perfecting his signature 
sound consisting of delicately structured soundscapes, and harmonies 
backed up with a chunky groove. HUMAN BLUE has released five albums in 
his career so far, with a sixth album slated for this summer, and hes 
been licensed to no less then 80 (!) compilations, as well as releasing

LOOPUS IN FABULA
(Fabula Records  Italy)
Live!
We are happy to welcome back LOOPUS IN FABULA, who made a remarkable 
surprise appearance at GMSF2004. With three albums to his name, he has 
established a reputation for the funkadelic sound; a mixture of 
mind-twisting Psytrance and funky Disco sounds. Having played almost 
every corner of the world, LOOPUS has developed and perfected a blended, 
live + DJ set with a special task: slowly bringing the dancefloor into a 
relaxed, happy, funky atmosphere full of laughs and funny smiles!

YAB-YUM / GASPARD / AJJA
(Peak Records  Switzerland)
Live & DJ sets! Trance & Downtempo sets! First North American 
appearance!
AJJA and GASPARD, two musicians, two sets of creative energy, influenced 
by each other and fusing into a whole that is greater then the sum of 
its parts. As co-founders of Switzerlands Peak Records, they have their 
fingers on the pulse of the full-power, nighttime sounds. Get ready for 
a colorful nighttime journey filled with futuristic freakiness -- a 
swirling carousel of loops and rhythms, spastic elastic sounds and funky 
leads, balanced by rolling bass-lines and powerful kicks! We proudly 
present the North American debut of YAB-YUM!

PHUTUREPRIMITIVE / TELEPATHIK
(Liquid Records  Portland, OR)
Live & DJ! Downtempo & Trance sets!
PHUTUREPRIMITIVE has become a top artist in the Downtempo/Psy-Chill 
music scene, performing throughout the United States and Europe with his 
fusion of organic and synthetic elements. Musically ranging from 
atmospheric downbeat and Drum n Bass patterns, to ethnic breaks, vocals 
and percussions, to dub and beyond -- creating a landscape of aural 
texture. For a Psytrance project, TELEPATHIK is diverse in its sound, 
sometimes leaning towards a more progressive groove, sometimes melodic, 
while other times diving straight into a full-on driving frenzy -- 
always shifting and changing into new sounds and themes. This is dance 
music that takes both your mind and body on a journey!

LEILA
(Dragonfly Records  UK)
As a veteran of the early Goa scene and the UKs free party culture, 
Leila has played at festivals across Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and Zambia, 
including twice at Samothraki. Her tunes are plucked from a spectrum of 
psychedelia, never too progressive or minimalist. Leila seduces with her 
insistent grooves, funky basslines, and multi-layered melodies, often 
harboring a hard-edged, spring-loaded bite! She may be a waif, but this 
little lady sure packs a punch!

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES

Subject: {pb-cle} Marco Carola.. this Sunday Night in Pittsburgh

For those not doing to DEMF, Marco Carola will be playing at Privilege 
Ultralounge in Pittsburgh's Strip District this Sunday night.

Presale tickets are $15. I have been delivering them all week; if anyone is 
interested in going, please let me know and I will go out of my way to get 
them to you.

Otherwise, have a wonderful Memorial weekend!

Paul

What a horrible night to have a curse.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and

Sat Jun 09                         BINARY                         Cleveland

1st Appearance in Cleveland!
Producer of Yoshitoshi's biggest hit "You are Sleeping" and Ibiza anthem
"Flying Song."

Favored among the likes of Deep Dish, Danny Howells, James Holden,
Hernan Cattaneo and Danny Tenaglia, this New York native has been
influencing the world's underground dance scene since the early 90's.

While hes known for his progressive tribal house sounds, his roots are
in hip-hop. He earned the name Quick Mix as a teenager when first wowing
audiences with his turntablist skills. Not straying far from his
background as a block party DJ growing up in Queens NY, he readily
demonstrates those turntable skills with seamless mixing, creative
layering and the clever use of acappellas, which often happen live and
in the moment. Like his productions, expect his house sets to be unique,
emotional and undeniable on the dance floor.

Notable productions include You Are Sleeping, "Flying Song", Nameless,
"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You", Ill Be Your Friend and Aenema amongst many,
many others. Sought after for his underground yet marketable sound,
Quick has also been summoned to remix major label artists such as Sarah
Mclachlan, Jimmy Page & Robert Plant, Robert Owens and BT, just to name
a few. His music has also been requested for licensed use in The Crazy
Frog Racer & Moto GP 2006.

Each year many A-List DJs from around the world license his songs for
their compilations, such as Roger Sanchez, Hernan Cattaneo, The
Timewriter, Peter Rauhofer, Dave Seaman & Phil K, James Holden, Deep
Dish, John Creamer & Stephane K, and Kenny Dope Gonzalez.

Quick is one of the most talented producers out there who has the
ability to think outside the box and continuously create fresh new event
records. ~Ali & Sharam (Deep Dish)

PQM is someone I admire very much. His music has a dark & twisted side
that can be downright scary at times, which, in my opinion, is a very
good thing! ~Danny Howells

Presenting the 6th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
~ Summer Solstice ~

Four Quarters, Central Pennsylvania, USA

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the
open air  truly, a magical event which has quickly become an annual
summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes! Now in its sixth year,
the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted world-class international
talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom, plus the finest regional talent in the USA, becoming a
destination for hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The
gathering includes a full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming,
lectures and workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and
much more in a sacred, sylvan sanctuary that only Four Quarters can
provide.

~ Stone Circle Stage: Psytrance & Progressive Trance ~

AMD
(Nano Records  UK)
Live! First North American appearance!
Presenting AMD, the Psytrance super-group consisting of the two solo
artists APHID MOON and DICKSTER. With their complementary production
skills and a shared love of full-on music, they make a formidable force,
taking Psytrance to a new and exciting place, delivering nothing but
floor-fillers with huge, multi-layered tracks that keeping building and
peaking! Having already rocked dancefloors in Brazil, Japan, Europe, and
the UK, in support of their debut album, Big Fish, we are fortunate to
have them for their first USA appearance! Get ready all you lovers of
dance!

DICKSTER / DICK TREVOR
(Nano Records  UK)
Live & DJ sets!
We are truly honored to host a Psytrance legend! DICK TREVOR has been at
the forefront of the Psytrance scene since its conception -- responsible
for seminal acts such as GREEN NUNS OF THE REVOLUTION, BUMBLING LOONS,
SLINKY NUNS, INFERNAL MACHINE, TRICKSTER, BISTO BOYS, GREEN OMS,
JUMANJI, and currently with DICKSTER and AMD. With unrivaled production
talent, and countless releases to his name, experience what an
undeniably experienced artist can do to a dancefloor!

APHID MOON
(Nano Records  UK)
Live! First North American appearance!
Over the last decade, APHID MOON has released on countless Psytrance
labels and played numerous parties and festivals in Japan, Israel, South
Africa, Brazil, Europe, and the UK. His hard-driving and infectious
dance sound made of clear grooves and intense psychedelics stands out of
the league of full-on you know already. His music is sharp and toxic
enough to expand your boarders of dance experience - demanding your
energy to create the dancefloors collective. This is Psychedelic Trance!

HUMAN BLUE
(Transient Records  Sweden)
Live!
Its been eight, long years since HUMAN BLUE first played in Philadelphia
for GAIAN MIND, and in that time, hes been busy both touring around the
globe and producing lots of tracks  testing and perfecting his signature
sound consisting of delicately structured soundscapes, and harmonies
backed up with a chunky groove. HUMAN BLUE has released five albums in
his career so far, with a sixth album slated for this summer, and hes
been licensed to no less then 80 (!) compilations, as well as releasing
a number of 12 vinyl releases. Prepare yourself for what is sure to be a
most memorable morning session!

LOOPUS IN FABULA
(Fabula Records  Italy)
Live!
We are happy to welcome back LOOPUS IN FABULA, who made a remarkable
surprise appearance at GMSF2004. With three albums to his name, he has
established a reputation for the funkadelic sound; a mixture of
mind-twisting Psytrance and funky Disco sounds. Having played almost
every corner of the world, LOOPUS has developed and perfected a blended,
live + DJ set with a special task: slowly bringing the dancefloor into a
relaxed, happy, funky atmosphere full of laughs and funny smiles!

YAB-YUM / GASPARD / AJJA
(Peak Records  Switzerland)
Live & DJ sets! Trance & Downtempo sets! First North American
appearance!
AJJA and GASPARD, two musicians, two sets of creative energy, influenced
by each other and fusing into a whole that is greater then the sum of
its parts. As co-founders of Switzerlands Peak Records, they have their
fingers on the pulse of the full-power, nighttime sounds. Get ready for
a colorful nighttime journey filled with futuristic freakiness -- a
swirling carousel of loops and rhythms, spastic elastic sounds and funky
leads, balanced by rolling bass-lines and powerful kicks! We proudly
present the North American debut of YAB-YUM!

PHUTUREPRIMITIVE / TELEPATHIK
(Liquid Records  Portland, OR)
Live & DJ! Downtempo & Trance sets!
PHUTUREPRIMITIVE has become a top artist in the Downtempo/Psy-Chill
music scene, performing throughout the United States and Europe with his
fusion of organic and synthetic elements. Musically ranging from
atmospheric downbeat and Drum n Bass patterns, to ethnic breaks, vocals
and percussions, to dub and beyond -- creating a landscape of aural
texture. For a Psytrance project, TELEPATHIK is diverse in its sound,
sometimes leaning towards a more progressive groove, sometimes melodic,
while other times diving straight into a full-on driving frenzy --
always shifting and changing into new sounds and themes. This is dance
music that takes both your mind and body on a journey!

LEILA
(Dragonfly Records  UK)
As a veteran of the early Goa scene and the UKs free party culture,
Leila has played at festivals across Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and Zambia,
including twice at Samothraki. Her tunes are plucked from a spectrum of
psychedelia, never too progressive or minimalist. Leila seduces with her
insistent grooves, funky basslines, and multi-layered melodies, often
harboring a hard-edged, spring-loaded bite! She may be a waif, but this
little lady sure packs a punch!

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s,
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful,
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place,
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love..
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo,
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels,
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital,
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches,
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car,
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} DEMF 2007 Photos

He was good, trout complained about some trainwrecks, but I heard 
some hugely long perfect mixes with at least 3 tracks going 
simultaneously.  Good track selection, although I think he brought 
the energy down a bit too much in the middle.  I guess that was his 
intention though, start fast, slow down then bring it back up for the 
end.  He did play some good old tracks though, which I always like to hear.
