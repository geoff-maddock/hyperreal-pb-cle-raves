             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Toronto-based producer and DJ Greg Gow, has long been a crowd favorite 
in Toronto.s electronic music scene.   As the founder of two 
internationally selling record labels, Restructured and Kombustion, Greg 
has fast become an ambassador for Canadian electronic music 
internationally. His rhythmical sensibility and technical talent has led 
Greg to join the ranks of premiere Canadian artists such as; DJ Preach, 
Misstress Barbara, John Acquaviva, Algorithm, Mateo Murphy and Richie 
Hawtin.

Early in his career Greg was exposed to various styles of music having 
attended warehouse events in Toronto and Detroit.  Initially, he 
collected hip hop records in the early nineties; but quickly gained 
recognition as a house music DJ on CHRY 105.5 FM York University radio.  
While Greg had established himself as a high-profile DJ in the Toronto 
house music circuit, his sound was rapidly evolving.  In 1996, 
influenced by the harder Detroit and German technological sounds, Greg 
traded his smooth house sound for dark atmospheric, intense and 
danceable techno. 

In 1997 the rave scene was exploding across Toronto, and it quickly 
became the ideal environment for Greg to display his hard rhythmic tones 
and technical brilliance.  Yet it was a fresh up-start techno production 
company, Phryl, where Greg.s stature of one of the top techno Djs in 
Canada was solidified.  Playing packed warehouses alongside 
international headliners such as; Adam Beyer, Joel Mull, Gaetano 
Parisio, Derrick May and Stacey Pullen.  His Phryl sets were regarded as 
brilliant and often overshadowed the top-billed acts he was playing 
with.  Greg was now a major player in the dance music scene in Toronto, 
and while the scene was shifting from warehouses to the more intimate 
club settings, he remained a staple in an ever-changing culture.

Greg Gow has enjoyed equal success as a promoter, DJ and Label Manager.  
Greg.s event production company Mono, was established in 2002 and is 
credited with bringing in some of the biggest names in Techno to 
Toronto.  Working with John Lickrish of Blue Bookings, Greg.s highly 
successful Mono events were hosted at various respected venues (System 
Soundbar, the Opera House and the Guvernment to name a few), bringing in 
talent such as; Richie Hawtin, Madga, Thomas Krome, Steve Bug and Speedy 
J. 

Greg.s DJ career was brought to the next level, when he signed with Blue 
Bookings.  This led to Greg.s well deserved association with other high 
caliber internationally touring DJs on the roster such as Marco Corola 
and Steve Bug.  He also had the opportunity to join Mauro Picotto on a 
mini tour, opening for him at Avalon  (formerly Limelight) in New York 
City and closing for Picotto in Toronto at the highly recognized 
Guvernment Nightclub, where Greg is frequently booked.  Presently, Greg 
holds down residencies at Toronto.s premiere electronic dance music 
destinations, System Soundbar, Comfort Zone and Film Lounge. 

Internationally, Greg has represented Toronto in Miami during the 2004 
Winter Music Conference at Privilege and this year at Space.  He has 
also played the legendary Detroit Movement Festival on the Techno Blvd. 
Stage, and was featured at the Tronic Treatment Party with Christian 
Smith in 2004. 

Ultimately it is Greg.s steady DJing career and his music productions 
that are leading to his ever-increasing recognition.  In the studio Greg 
combines analogue and digital equipment to compose banging climactic 
Detroit style techno that often features minor key stabs. His releases 
on labels including Seismic Detroit, Default, Zen, 2Wars and Tresor have 
garnered spins from top DJs Rush, Umek, and Mateo Murphy.

Greg.s own internationally selling labels; Restructured and Kombustion, 
feature his music and other artists. music from around the world.  
Restructured productions have been spotted in the crates of globe 
trotting DJs including Steve Rachmad and Ben Sims. In Chicago, Greg has 
played alongside DJ Frankie Vega and he is releasing tracks on Uppercut 
(a subsidiary of Dust Traxx). 

Greg has forthcoming releases including: the .Jack Theory EP. on Berrata 
Music (Detroit); .Eclipse. on Metapath; new tracks on Chris Liebing.s 
label Touchtone; and another on Omniscent (California). Restructured is 
releasing the .No Hockey EP. in Spring 2005 which features remixes of 
.Game 7. by fellow Canadians DJ Preach and Marco G.

Evidently, Greg Gow is a respected Canadian player in the game for the 
long-term with plans for 2005 and beyond. Music industry personages and 
fans can rest assured Greg Gow.s endeavors will live up to the calibre 
of excellence that he has thus far displayed.

Andy Vaz - Background Records, [--] - Germany
Andy Vaz hails from Düsseldorf, Germany. Andy manages and curates 
Background Recordings. Andy has been a pinnacle cornerstone of the 
German electronic music movement. He is highly regarded as one of the 
essential individuals on the global front for providing a cultural 
conduit for electronic music, between Düsseldorf, San Francisco, 
Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, London, South Africa and countless other 
cities around the world. Background recordings has been a major force in 
the presentation of minimal techno, introducing and educating the world 
to the geographic variable influences that exist within the genre.

In 2000, Andy Vaz has released his own material. After many years of 
work in the studio, Andy was reluctant to release his music. taking the 
time needed to polish and refine the sound, and feel that it was on par 
with his contemporaries, his first 12", "Sounds Variation 1-1" was met 
with incredible international acclaim. Sounds_variation is based on the 
use of the same sounds, re-used throughout, giving each track another 
musical approach by pushing each instrument in a different compositional 
direction by re-arrangement, toneshifting and by adding/changing effects 
in order to demonstrate that a defined production criteria brings forth 
maximal results through the process of limitation within a lo-fi 
aesthetic. The first edition of the Andy Vaz vinyl series on the elusive 
and nameless label is therefore entitled [---].

NINJA'S of MINIMAL MADNESS: Jimi Tsang & Jason Allen
Mentor (Tsang) and apprentice (Allen) have combined their differences in 
music preference to deliver dance floors a ball of minimal wax that 
penetrates your left ear, melts your brain for 37 nanoseconds, then 
exits the right ear leaving you on the floor saying "holy eargasm 
batman!". Listen to the ninja's of minimal madness kick you in the ear 
with the bleeps, the sweeps and the creeps!

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!

MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

[BROTHER MIKE] vs.[ANGELUS] - 10pm to 2am - The changing of the guard ...

tagging all night long as MIKE, after 4 long years as the resident DJ, says 
goodbye to Thursday Nights and ANGELUS says hello as his new replacement.

some records.

So it's been over 6 years now and our house and techno night,

appropriatly called MOVED.  We'll be kicking it off THIS SATURDAY JUNE 3rd

then be taking the Thursday slot at the club starting June 15th ... and 
Tuesdays will now be the host to a new night of progressive house and breaks 
music called IDENTITY CRISIS manned by Paul Fleetwood, Matt Monroe and their 
crew of deviants.

Upcoming Thursday DJs:

[PARIS 68] - Detroit Tag Team - www.paris68.org
and special guest:
[OUTPUTMESSAGE] - Live Techno Performance - Born in Queens, New York, in 
1983, spending his formative middle-school years in New Jersey, and finally 
ending up in Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka Outputmessage) can be given 
that rare title of "young musical prodigy." During his time in New Jersey, 
he first became fascinated with a broad range of music, eventually keying in 
on electronic; and when his family got its first computer in the summer of 
1998, he began making music on his own. Now, while a mathematics graduate 
student at Virginia Tech, he spends his off time writing
tight, hook-laden tracks. Outputmessage debuted with a remix of Dabrye on 
the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a track ("Bernards 
Song") on Ghostly's Idol Tryouts
compilation before even turning 20. Later the Oneiros EP was released on 
Echelon Productions. This year "Sommeil" was released on the Ghostly's Idol 
Tryouts Two compilation and Outputmessage's debut LP, Nebulae, is set to 
drop this June on Melodic.
Outputmessage was also recently featured in URB's Next 100.

Lucky bastard... Congratulations.  I'm just about to buy one of their
FR series amps, I had one in the 90s and I fucking loved it. Crispest
sound I've ever heard, it p1mped out the kraftwelt. Unfortunately one
day DJ Trevor's wife  (anyone know what happened to Trevor?) called me
that she was stuck in Oakland on the street, and a tornado was coming,
so I went and picked her up, but I left the window cracked 2 inches,
like 3 feet from the amp, and while I was dropping her off at her
house, the tornado went by my house and blew water sideways into my
house blowing up the amp. Yeah they have tornados in Pittsburgh.

What all system did ya get?

i saw trevor play in pittsburgh last fall, the night before bassclown's
wedding... technoir played and here was the promotional blurb for that night
[defiance]

[TREVOR COMBEE] aka The Instigator - Atlanta, GA

Either you are going to have the time of your life with him or his presence
and DJ set will destroy you.  People that know Trevor understand this.
Which ever, it's worth the gamble and no party is complete without The
Instigator.  Mr. Combee's time in PGH was a vital stepping stone to the
Electronic Music Scene in this city.  Early Raves, Record Store, Record
Label, Late night sets at afterhours ... this guy did it all.  If you were
too young to remember then you best come out and recognize.

I got offered this system:

(2) - SA1530Z Speakers

(2) - SRM450 Speakers

(1) - Onyx 1620 PA Mixer

(1) - SWA 1801 Subwoofer

or a $3000 gift cert to prosound or $2000 cash

I took the $3000 gift cert. The sound system is nice but too big.

I'm getting new tables and a new macbook.

I just got one of these too.  You may have read this email right, but  
it is not PayPal who sent it.  It is spam since every  url takes you  
somewhere else aside from directly to the PayPal site.

Yeah if anyone sees a recording of this pop up

understand, it should be a nice, professional quality
recording. Hit me up if you would like his info. It
was awesome to see them after 10 years and I had a
great time enjoying it with you guys too (Trout,

those #s are likely fake, i've read about a new phishing tactic to get

>> This is a reminder that we need you to confirm your bank account. 
>> This bank account was added to your PayPal account on 2006 and ends 
>> in the last four digits ****.
>> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>
>> How To Confirm Your Bank Account
>>
>> PayPal has made two small deposits into the bank account you just 
>> registered. These deposits should appear in your bank account in 
>> business days.
>> Call your bank to find out your two deposit amounts from PayPal.      
>> Step 1:Call your bank, use your ATM statement, or go to your online 
>> bank account to find out what the exact amounts of these two deposits 
>> are. You can also check your paper bank statement for these amounts. 
>> They will be listed as deposits from PayPal.
>> Enter the exact amounts of the two deposits into your PayPal 
>> account         Step 2:Log in 
>> <http://rds.yahoo.com/S=44831148:D1/CS=44831248/SS=44831166/SIG=11v8331g7/*http://2393239468:8018/www.paypal.com> 
>> to your PayPal account. Click on the "Confirm Bank Account" link in 
>> the "Activate Account" box and enter the exact amounts that were 
>> deposited into your bank.
>>        
>>
>> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>
>> Why Confirm Your Bank Account?
>>
>> It increases security
>> When you enter the two amounts that PayPal deposited into your bank 
>> account, you confirm that you are the owner of this bank account. 
>> This is because only you as the owner would have access to the exact 
>> amounts of the 2 deposits PayPal sent. This process increases the 
>> safety of the entire PayPal payments network.
>> Your PayPal account will become verified
>> Your PayPal account becomes verified once you confirm your bank 
>> account. With a verified account, there is no limit on the amount of 
>> money you can send through PayPal when you choose to make these 
>> payments using funds from your bank account.
>> When you confirm your bank account:
>>
>>     * You will improve your reputation by letting others know you're a
>>       confirmed, Verfied member of the PayPal community
>>     * Your sending limit will be removed
>>     * You will be able to fund purchases directly from your checking
>>       or savings account, in addition to using credit cards
>>     * You will be able to add funds to your PayPal account directly
>>       from your bank account
>>     * You will be able to send money to friends, family, and PayPal
>>       Personal Account holders
>>
>> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

and special guest:
[OUTPUTMESSAGE] - Live Techno Performance - Born in Queens, New York, in 
1983, spending his formative middle-school years in New Jersey, and finally 
ending up in Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka Outputmessage) can be given 
that rare title of "young musical prodigy." During his time in New Jersey, 
he first became fascinated with a broad range of music, eventually keying in 
on electronic; and when his family got its first computer in the summer of 
1998, he began making music on his own. Now, while a mathematics graduate 
student at Virginia Tech, he spends his off time writing
tight, hook-laden tracks. Outputmessage debuted with a remix of Dabrye on 
the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a track ("Bernards 
Song") on Ghostly's Idol Tryouts
compilation before even turning 20. Later the Oneiros EP was released on 
Echelon Productions. This year "Sommeil" was released on the Ghostly's Idol 
Tryouts Two compilation and Outputmessage's debut LP, Nebulae, is set to 
drop this June on Melodic.
Outputmessage was also recently featured in URB's Next 100.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} disco bloodbath

Got any drum and bass? I'm assuming that the "Rave" djs are playing
techno of some sort? Gabber would be good :) I'm just talking
selfishly here :^)

What do you think the dress will be like? Never been to anything
remotely like this. I get to play barbie doll with Adrienne, I'm
thinking something along the lines of what's on the flyer... some fake
blood or something added in? Seems like you gotta have some bloody
babes in a Disco Bloodbath.

Nice, just wish there were more that you took!  I really need to get a
DSLR, those look pretty spectacular.  what ISO were you using? 1600?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DEMF 2006 Pictures (yea, fine, i actually went to
  a rave, took pictures and updated my damn website)

I always take loads more pictures than anyone sees.  That's the 
nature of the beast I think.  I shot about 250 pictures at DEMF and 
those were the "keepers".  Often times i'll take the same picture 
with slight variations in focus, depth of field and exposure just to 
get the perfect one.

well, here's the problem:  my canon 10D (still one of the best pro 
backup cameras out there, the 20D and 30D are based on the digital 
rebel not on pro bodies) can't take the same pictures at iso 1600 as 
my film camera (canon EOS elan IIe) can with ISO 400 speed film.  The 
point of ISO ratings is to have standardized light sensitivity, so 
you can calculate exposure.  Theoretically, if I"m using the same 
lens, the cameras should perform the same at the same ISO.  (at least 
in terms of exposure)  Well, they don't.  At least not in low light 
situations.  For everyday stuff, they are the same.  My trademark 
rave photography seems to be the exception to the rule.

If you are on my site and want to know what ISO i was using, you can 
click on the "photo properties" in the upper left corner of the 
screen.  it shows you the exposure and camera data for each image.  I 
try to shoot the lowest ISO possible to get the shutter speeds I 
want.  Most outside shots are ISO 100 or 200.  inside shots, since 
there was limited intelligent lighting (obviously my photographic 
trademark) I had to work with low light and used iso 800 and 
1600.  (although the camera has 3200)

Last summer I was the official photographer of the last Hullabaloo! 
party in toronto, and I brought my 10D along and got some great 
stuff.  Te photos I took there very closely resemble my film stuff to 
the uneducated eye.  I was certainly on point that night, and got 
some incredible images, but still nothing to compete with the likes 
of my film days.  (the 113 images online were the best of over 700)

Yeah I've taken the same approach when i was in Japan.  I'm going to  
unzip all the images tonight when I get home but I've literally taken  
1,000s of pictures over the two weeks.  I'm guessing there will only  
be a few dozen that will actually see the public internets.  Maybe  
some more that were kinda ok that I'll still keep.  But I usually  
dump at least 1/4 of the pictures I take at a party, probably dump  
more than 1/3 of these.   I usually keep anything that isn't just a  
big f up.  Like extremely out of focus or something.  I almost never  
delete a picture off the actual camera since there have been pictures  
that look like crap on the camera but look great on a monitor.  I  
know I took some really good ones that I'll probably get blown up and  
framed.  Played with the depth of field and stuff.  Need to look into  
photography stuff since I couldn't get long exposures to come out  
right and not be too bright or not that long of shutter speed.  not  
sure how big I can make a 5 MP image.  It's officially rated at  
'larger than 8 1/2 x 11' but doesn't say how much larger.   
Silverraver would have had a field day in Japan.  Plenty of photo ops.

well then I guess I wish there were more keepers... haha.  the ones I
liked were 800 and 1600 iso.. the 1600 looks about as grainy as my
canon s70 P+S gets at 400 which is why I asked.. and it just can't go
beyond that which is very limiting for low light stuff where I don't
want to use the flash.  I think the large lenses mean less noise and
greater sensitivity and so I have no choice but to upgrade if I want
to take less noisy and sharper photos at thigns like this..

well, i wasn't that inspired, to be honest.  Canon is known to have 
the best lowlight performance, and their new pro camera bodies (which 
may be in my near future) are pretty noise and 'digital grain' free 
well past iso 1600.  their iso 1600 looks like my iso 400.  But they 
also cost $3500

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DEMF 2006 Pictures (yea, fine, i actually went to
  a rave, took pictures and updated my damn website)

if you go to a lab that has a Fuji Frontier machine, (walmart, sam's 
club, walgreens, almost all small camera shops that can afford one) 
you can make a 5mp image easily 8x10. The algorhythm they use works 
really well and they print optically onto real photo paper using 
lasers.  so you get a real silver halide print.  I routinely make 
8x12 (different sensor size) prints from my 6.3mp camera with no 
upsizing.  but i've tested that on their machine I could print the 
equivalent of 20x30 or something without noticing any pixellation 
(from a realistic distance)

good luck
B

PS, I also only shoot raw and print Tiff, because jpg artifacts 
account for most of the crapy image quality in printing.

yeah, my canon A95 gets grainy at 400 iso.  I pretty much just don't  
go below 200.  the long exposure ones I talked about I tried setting  
it on iso 50 and a focal point of 8.0, which was the max it could do,  
and depending on cloud cover could maybe get a 1/4 second "long"  
exposure speed without it getting oversaturated.  Really wish I  
bought lenses for the camera.  The polarizing lens would have been  
really handy for when I was taking pics out of the bullet train, a  
few have the reflection of the camera i it.

yea, the rule of thumb is not to hand-hold any exposure longer than 
1/60 of a second.  I have abnormally steady hands and can handhold 
1/40 and sometimes 1/30, but you should never go below 1/focal 
length.  like for example my 200mm lens, i shouldn't handhold it less 
than 1/200 sec.  but it has the stabilizer, so i can go to about 1/100 or so.

hope that helps.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DEMF 2006 Pictures (yea, fine, i actually went to a rave, took pictures and updated my damn website)

As much as I'd rather go somewhere else, I really like walmarts photo  
processing, and it's just down the road.  Going to print out a few  
pictures for the gifts I'm giving my nieces and nephews.  I got some  
sea shells from underneath the one large gate that "floats" in the  
water at high tide but you can walk under it on low tide.  Got some  
pictures of the sea shells with i in the background so the kids can  
see where I got them from.

I liike how when they're showing the different cameras and the  
picture quality they print them all on 4x6 sized photos so really  
after 3 mp you can't even really notice a difference.

it's not so much the steadyness of it.  I always prop it against  
something when I do a long exposue shot.  the problem is it gets too  
bright if I hold it open for too long of a time.  Could be one of  
those things where I just need a higher ISO camera, but don't have  
the 12,000 to buy a camera :)

Here's the details basically:

 The guys running Off_Protocol @ Metropolis invite Jamie Tyler and Mark Strauss of Plate Tectonics to play coming up on Friday.  That's THIS Friday June 9th @ Metropolis Nightclub. Free before 11 pm, $5 cover after. 18+ event, 21+ to drink. $2 
domestics, $3 bombs.  I believe the doors open at 9pm and the cool house collective guys will play before and after Jamie and Mark.  

Metropolis is located @ 2325 Elm Street, Cleveland, Ohio for those who don't know.
   
  Expect some darn good techno on a nice big system. (When's the last time we heard a whole night of techno @ Metropolis?!?!)  If you haven't been there in awhile, it's worth a visit.  The Cool House guys have been doing a great job with this weekly, the venue has made some improvements(like a new dance floor) and the sound is great.
   
  I'd expect you'll hear some hard hitting, banging good tracks.  : )  Be prepared to dance.

(When's the last time we heard a whole night of techno @ Metropolis?!?!)&nbsp; If you haven't been there in awhile, it's worth a visit.&nbsp; The Cool House guys have been doing a great job with this weekly, the venue has made some improvements(like a new dance floor) and&nbsp;the sound is great.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I'd expect you'll hear some hard
 hitting, banging good tracks.&nbsp; : )&nbsp; Be prepared to dance.&nbsp; <BR></div><BR><BR>http://www.platetectonics.org<p>&#32;__________________________________________________<br>Do You Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?  Yahoo! Mail has the best spam protection around <br>http://mail.yahoo.com

The problem I'm discovering is that in digital photography there is no 'exposure latitude' like there is with so many print films.. it's essentially like shooting slides, it seems to me.  Like, with film you can expose for the shadows and the highlights will usually take care of themselves because negative film can record more in the highlights than what you would normally print.. but with digital, once you take the picture, every manipulation you do is throwing away data.
   
  I've been wanting to do some zone system experiments with my film SLR vs. my DSLR.. I just have a first generation digital rebel, nothing too fancy, but I'm curious about how many stops the Rebel can capture vs, say, TMax100 film..
   
  Too bad I don't have a densitometer...

Anyway, czech out what i've got.

Subject: {pb-cle} Where's everyone going for the weekend?

*gasp* actually talking about parties on here:

So I was first hell bent on Bumpin Berry Bass this weekend till I
realized there's "Fuk a Headliner" in cleveland.  Which is cheaper, with
better djs, than bumpin berry bass.  Although the venue, if they use the
same one as last time, was pimp.  Where the party in Cleveland is down
in the flats... 'nuff said. But there's an actual party again in pgh.
Could the pgh vs cle rival parties startup again??  not really since
both areas suck :)

If I remember, paxahau recorded all the sets in the underground stage  
last year.  You can listen to them in a low quaily real audio format  
or if you made a "donation" to paxahau you could get a high quailty  
cd as a "gift" (sounded to me like they're just selling the high  
quality ones to make some quick cash).  As much of a demand these  
will be in, esp the prototype 909, you'd have no problems creating a  
torrent for them.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DEMF Sets...

I have heard N O T H I N G about recorded sets...I've been to my usual
haunts for torrents and such, and haven't seen anything yet.

I'm especially interested in the Real Detroit stage, of which I saw
NONE of the sets I was interested in seeing.

Anyone with info, please fess up!

artist would get into something groovy - BAM!  fuggin hd camera all up in
their face lensing as to block the view of everyone else... maybe if you buy
the dvd you'll get to see something you would rather just listen to.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Where's everyone going for the weekend?

There's been 1 party in Pittsburgh this year, and 2 planned with firm
dates. Of the 2 planned with firm dates BOTH of them have had a party
spring up in cleveland on the EXACT SAME DAY. (kool-aid 2 and freq
fest)

I even heard a bunch of ex-scenesters in pgh threw a house party on
the night of Kool-aid.

WTF IS UP WITH THIS SHIT?

Sorry but I will never support promoters date-jacking another promoters party.

>From now on, I will always go to the party that advertised the date first.

Back in 98 I could see it, but now there's just too few partys to
support this type of shit.

I encourage all local DJs and partygoers to boycott date-jacking parties.

There's something on isohunt, I'm just not sure if its this year or

Maybe someone else can tell by looking.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Where's everyone going for the weekend?

I thinks it's more like last minute promotions.  There's been a  
couple things I've planned stuff to do at a friends place because I  
see nothing happening that weekend and then like a week or two before  
there's like 3 things happening in one night.  And then not checking  
if that date is already taken and just picking some date and going  
with it.  I go to parties based on convenience (gas is friggin  
expensive) and talent.  There's a lot more people playing at the  
cleveland that I want to see than at the pgh one.  Other's from  
around cleveland may go to the pgh one because it has more people  
playing they want to hear.

sorry dan, if you hadn't noticed cleveland sorta has parties on a more 
regular basis (well parties and club stuff worth hitting). cleveland 
promoters honestly aren't worried about pittsburgh because how many kids 
from pgh drive to cleveland?  i can count you guys on one hand.  the 
frequency fest thing was resolved, matt is pushing his back to some 
unspecified date which is pretty cool.  sucks though i'm playing the 
clev party and will miss koolade, but oh well shit happens.  sad about 
missing rowland the bastard and p19.

really what it comes down to is cleveland is its own scene and so is 
pgh.  akron tends to blend with cleveland

so that's why we bring it back together....

if some of you may have noticed, there is cook da goose 4 this year - July
8th, location somewhere near crAkron / CIA Secret, OH.  who's interested?

traat and I have been trying to put this together and doing it no budget
style - so instead of years past where there was free alcohol and free food
and free sex to be had, you need to bring your own (well, the sex part might
be free if you have good negotiation skills with the opposite sex).

it will be traditional house party stylee including a swimming pool this
year so that i can pass out on a floating chair after the Jager kicks in.

any previous cdg deejays should contact myself or trout if you're interested
in playing again this year, as we are planning slightly late compared to
years past.  we pretty much have everything under control except a lineup
and a grill (anyone got one in the crAkron area that would be willing to
bring it?).

that's all for now... discuss amongst yourselves.

It's good to hear the Freq Fest conflict was resolved... Yeah I have
only driven to Cle parties twice this year, seems like the CLE guys
get out more often... But then again I had to rent a car both times...
My car gets here Sunday so hopefully I'll be out that way more
often... After the pathetic showing in Akron though I'm not sure I'll
hit many parties there lol :)  House parties in Akron seem to be
better than the club parties. I've had some great times at AK house
parties. It seems like there's alot of club nights in Cle but not that
many rave-till-dawn events? I guess I'm over-protective of those type
of events since that's what I really live for.

It's a rule that I must find a way to go. I'm sure I'll find a way to go
topless. (Dave reading over my shoulder says "Great ...")

I´m in Ecuador at the moment. This keyboard is weird.

Anyone know what time this thing is planning on shutting down? The

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

[PARIS 68] - Detroit Techno Tag Team - www.paris68.org

and special guest:

[OUTPUTMESSAGE] - Live PA - Born in Queens, New York, in 1983, spending 
his formative middle-school years in New Jersey, and finally ending up 
in Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka Outputmessage) can be given that 
rare title of "young musical prodigy." During his time in New Jersey, he 
first became fascinated with a broad range of music, eventually keying 
in on electronic; and when his family got its first computer in the 
summer of 1998, he began making music on his own. Now, while a 
mathematics graduate student at Virginia Tech, he spends his off time 
writing tight, hook-laden tracks. Outputmessage debuted with a remix of 
Dabrye on the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a 
track ("Bernards Song") on Ghostly's Idol Tryouts compilation before 
even turning 20. Later the Oneiros EP was released on Echelon 
Productions. This year "Sommeil" was released on the Ghostly's Idol 
Tryouts Two compilation and Outputmessage's debut LP, Nebulae, is set to

Sat Jun 17                        GREG GOW                        Cleveland

with......John K, Funkdetective & Damien


Toronto-based producer and DJ Greg Gow, has long been a crowd favorite 
in Toronto.s electronic music scene.   As the founder of two 
internationally selling record labels, Restructured and Kombustion, Greg 
has fast become an ambassador for Canadian electronic music 
internationally. His rhythmical sensibility and technical talent has led 
Greg to join the ranks of premiere Canadian artists such as; DJ Preach, 
Misstress Barbara, John Acquaviva, Algorithm, Mateo Murphy and Richie 
Hawtin.

Early in his career Greg was exposed to various styles of music having 
attended warehouse events in Toronto and Detroit.  Initially, he 
collected hip hop records in the early nineties; but quickly gained 
recognition as a house music DJ on CHRY 105.5 FM York University radio.  
While Greg had established himself as a high-profile DJ in the Toronto 
house music circuit, his sound was rapidly evolving.  In 1996, 
influenced by the harder Detroit and German technological sounds, Greg 
traded his smooth house sound for dark atmospheric, intense and 
danceable techno. 

In 1997 the rave scene was exploding across Toronto, and it quickly 
became the ideal environment for Greg to display his hard rhythmic tones 
and technical brilliance.  Yet it was a fresh up-start techno production 
company, Phryl, where Greg.s stature of one of the top techno Djs in 
Canada was solidified.  Playing packed warehouses alongside 
international headliners such as; Adam Beyer, Joel Mull, Gaetano 
Parisio, Derrick May and Stacey Pullen.  His Phryl sets were regarded as 
brilliant and often overshadowed the top-billed acts he was playing 
with.  Greg was now a major player in the dance music scene in Toronto, 
and while the scene was shifting from warehouses to the more intimate 
club settings, he remained a staple in an ever-changing culture.

Greg Gow has enjoyed equal success as a promoter, DJ and Label Manager.  
Greg.s event production company Mono, was established in 2002 and is 
credited with bringing in some of the biggest names in Techno to 
Toronto.  Working with John Lickrish of Blue Bookings, Greg.s highly 
successful Mono events were hosted at various respected venues (System 
Soundbar, the Opera House and the Guvernment to name a few), bringing in 
talent such as; Richie Hawtin, Madga, Thomas Krome, Steve Bug and Speedy 
J. 

Greg.s DJ career was brought to the next level, when he signed with Blue 
Bookings.  This led to Greg.s well deserved association with other high 
caliber internationally touring DJs on the roster such as Marco Corola 
and Steve Bug.  He also had the opportunity to join Mauro Picotto on a 
mini tour, opening for him at Avalon  (formerly Limelight) in New York 
City and closing for Picotto in Toronto at the highly recognized 
Guvernment Nightclub, where Greg is frequently booked.  Presently, Greg 
holds down residencies at Toronto.s premiere electronic dance music 
destinations, System Soundbar, Comfort Zone and Film Lounge. 

Internationally, Greg has represented Toronto in Miami during the 2004 
Winter Music Conference at Privilege and this year at Space.  He has 
also played the legendary Detroit Movement Festival on the Techno Blvd. 
Stage, and was featured at the Tronic Treatment Party with Christian 
Smith in 2004. 

Ultimately it is Greg.s steady DJing career and his music productions 
that are leading to his ever-increasing recognition.  In the studio Greg 
combines analogue and digital equipment to compose banging climactic 
Detroit style techno that often features minor key stabs. His releases 
on labels including Seismic Detroit, Default, Zen, 2Wars and Tresor have 
garnered spins from top DJs Rush, Umek, and Mateo Murphy.

Greg.s own internationally selling labels; Restructured and Kombustion, 
feature his music and other artists. music from around the world.  
Restructured productions have been spotted in the crates of globe 
trotting DJs including Steve Rachmad and Ben Sims. In Chicago, Greg has 
played alongside DJ Frankie Vega and he is releasing tracks on Uppercut 
(a subsidiary of Dust Traxx). 

Greg has forthcoming releases including: the .Jack Theory EP. on Berrata 
Music (Detroit); .Eclipse. on Metapath; new tracks on Chris Liebing.s 
label Touchtone; and another on Omniscent (California). Restructured is 
releasing the .No Hockey EP. in Spring 2005 which features remixes of 
.Game 7. by fellow Canadians DJ Preach and Marco G.

Evidently, Greg Gow is a respected Canadian player in the game for the 
long-term with plans for 2005 and beyond. Music industry personages and 
fans can rest assured Greg Gow.s endeavors will live up to the calibre 
of excellence that he has thus far displayed.

Andy Vaz - Background Records, [--] - Germany
Andy Vaz hails from Düsseldorf, Germany. Andy manages and curates 
Background Recordings. Andy has been a pinnacle cornerstone of the 
German electronic music movement. He is highly regarded as one of the 
essential individuals on the global front for providing a cultural 
conduit for electronic music, between Düsseldorf, San Francisco, 
Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, London, South Africa and countless other 
cities around the world. Background recordings has been a major force in 
the presentation of minimal techno, introducing and educating the world 
to the geographic variable influences that exist within the genre.

In 2000, Andy Vaz has released his own material. After many years of 
work in the studio, Andy was reluctant to release his music. taking the 
time needed to polish and refine the sound, and feel that it was on par 
with his contemporaries, his first 12", "Sounds Variation 1-1" was met 
with incredible international acclaim. Sounds_variation is based on the 
use of the same sounds, re-used throughout, giving each track another 
musical approach by pushing each instrument in a different compositional 
direction by re-arrangement, toneshifting and by adding/changing effects 
in order to demonstrate that a defined production criteria brings forth 
maximal results through the process of limitation within a lo-fi 
aesthetic. The first edition of the Andy Vaz vinyl series on the elusive 
and nameless label is therefore entitled [---].

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB
http://www.spreeandadb.com/
DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

The 3-Day Experience
The 12th Annual World Electronic Music Festival or simply the .3-Day. as
it.s become known over the years, is the 2006 installment of the largest
and longest running event of its kind in Canada. With a rich variety of
music, artists, performers and music lovers from around the world, it is
an experience that is unique and enduring for all those who have made it
part of their lives.

It is the 3-Day Experience that we invite you to enjoy once more and
potentially one last time. After searching across the province the WEMF
collective has chosen a site that will allow it to create an event that
is true to the roots of where WEMF came from and what it has become. A
remote, forested campground, located on a crystal clear lakefront will
bring all the music back outside where it belongs. Camping, dancing,
enjoying the company of friends and everything else that the 3-Day
Experience allows can only be enhanced by the presence of the sun and
the stars!

With this return to nature, we are also transforming the 3-Day
Experience to a themed environment that will create a completely new
level of connection and interaction with the music, the land and each
other. In 2006 all stages will be themed. Travel through the experience
by Air, Sea, Land and Space. Travel into your Mind and through Time into
the future. We invite those new and old to join us for a completely
fresh but quite likely final, 3-Day Experience!

THURSDAYS@HAVANA
TONIGHT 06.08.06 - SPECIAL EVENT

Our last Thursday ... for real ...

[PARIS 68] - Detroit Tag Team - www.paris68.org

and special guest:

[OUTPUTMESSAGE] - Live Techno Performance - Born in Queens, New York, in 
1983, spending his formative middle-school years in New Jersey, and finally 
ending up in Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka Outputmessage) can be given 
that rare title of "young musical prodigy." During his time in New Jersey, 
he first became fascinated with a broad range of music, eventually keying in 
on electronic; and when his family got its first computer in the summer of 
1998, he began making music on his own. Now, while a mathematics graduate 
student at Virginia Tech, he spends his off time writing
tight, hook-laden tracks. Outputmessage debuted with a remix of Dabrye on 
the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a track ("Bernards 
Song") on Ghostly's Idol Tryouts
compilation before even turning 20. Later the Oneiros EP was released on 
Echelon Productions. This year "Sommeil" was released on the Ghostly's Idol 
Tryouts Two compilation and Outputmessage's debut LP, Nebulae, is set to 
drop this June on Melodic.
Outputmessage was also recently featured in URB's Next 100 and Entertainment 
Weekly.

Free Download of his song "Sommeil"

I support CDG all the fucking way.

As far as venue (house) is concerned, I may not be able t o help in that 
arena... I haven't been or hosted a good house party in way too freakin 
long.

I'll help out in any way I can, though; if a slot needs filled I would love 
to play, though I imagine there are more than enough DJ's stocked and 
locked...

http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5434687

Originally meant to be a teen repellent they're now using it as a  
ringtone so only kids can hear it and not their teachers.  Forget  
what the frequency is that the mp3 is in, sounds like 15khz from a  
tone generator I have on here, that one is only supposed be heard by  
most people under 30.  I tested the 17khz one that most under 20 can  
hear and I can still hear it.

Oh my god that fucking hurts.

i've always had a problem with real high frequencies... like walking into
someone's house when their TV is turned on and obviously they have no clue
it's turned on - say after they finish watching a vhs tape or the likes.
this tone reminds me of that, only lower frequency... where did you listen
to the 17KHz one?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: test your hearing

I'm subscribe to the NPR technology podcast and it mentioned it there
but I couldn't hear it, which I think was due to the lower quality of
the mp3.  There's an app for the mac called "Tone Generator X" that,
conveniently enough, generates tones.  I compared the mp3 file to the
15khz tone and they sounded the same.  I made it 17k and I could
slightly hear it.  18k was VERRRY faint, even the one you posted I had
to turn up the volume a bit to hear it.  Just be careful you don't blow
your speakers, or if they can even handle a tone that high.  I should
get my sony professional headphones but they're in da basement and too
lazy to go down and get em :)

Do you have the coke bottles down there with key rings of the different
soccer teams on poker chips?  Had them in Japan and got one of the U.S.
since, you know, everyone is all about soccer in the U.S.  Plus all the
japan ones were taken already.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG was Re: {pb-cle} Where's everyone going for the
 weekend?

I've been considering recording this if no one steps up to it.  Just
bring my old laptop and that usb audio thingy I have and record away.
Also have one of those little 1 gig iaudio mp3 players that can record,
too.  Thing is, at least if we use my mixer, the "cassette out" or
whatever it's called makes too hot of a signal.  Haven't tried it with
the usb thing, may not be as bad.

No, nothing like that. Sounds a little too hi-tech for Ecuador. We were
lucky enough to get coke in our coke bottles.

i'm assuming you mean the liquid kind.

cause getting the OTHER kind in a bottle in ecuador wouldn't surprise
me in the least.

{{ if some of you may have noticed, there is cook da goose 4 this year - 
July 8th, location somewhere near crAkron / CIA Secret, OH.  who's 
interested? }}

I haven't missed it yet and don't plan to. Things are pretty insane with 
work an'at but they can all get fuckered because I'll be in Akron July 8th.

-

{{ traat and I have been trying to put this together and doing it no

free food and free sex to be had, you need to bring your own (well, the 
sex part might be free if you have good negotiation skills with the 
opposite sex). }}

I've fucked up the sex thing every year so whatever. I can rustle up a 
gang of shit on all other fronts though, plus the infamous elixir that 
helps the REST of you heathens get laid. Hey, maybe I'll get laid too as 
long as Ridley keeps all manner of coprophilic carpophores out of my 
mouth (and other orifices as well) - a little taste of that and a 4-way 
orgy with paparazzi banging on the bedroom door starts sounding like a 
BAD idea...

-

{{ it will be traditional house party stylee including a swimming pool 
this year so that i can pass out on a floating chair after the Jager 
kicks in. }}

After all these years I must confess that I hate the word stylee. Steez 
or steelo.

-

{{ any previous cdg deejays should contact myself or trout if you're 
interested in playing again this year, as we are planning slightly late 
compared to years past.  we pretty much have everything under control 
except a lineup and a grill (anyone got one in the crAkron area that 
would be willing to bring it?). }}

There has to be a big stupid charcoal thing or I'm not coming. Call 
around for a rental and get me a figure.

{{ that's all for now... discuss amongst yourselves. }}

Don't feel bad, I'm never part of the sex thing, although I never  
try, either, and the way things happen I still end up witnessing the  
after-effects of said debauchery.  Guess I'll just stick to drinking  
the punch and watching the evening unfold.  Maybe just stay in the  
pool, could be a good anti-sex measure, one look at my big belly will  
immediately to your rock solid game into a pile of tepid mush.

My fondest memory, although quite lame, is walking around cdg2 going  
"hi, I'm todd, and I'm drunk" as that was pretty much all I said the  
whole time.  That and a few now infamous pictures of a mr tsang.

Uhhh...yeah. I'm down with T on that one. I missed all of the boobies,
orgies, insertion of things into orifices, etc. I've only been to
CDG3, and I passed out in Goose's then-roommate's bed (female) and
woke up next to his then-soon-to-be roommate (male)...

Acually, to rephrase...I don't _THINK_ I was a part of any
debauchery...but Alan could've just been very thorough in "returning
my tray table to its upright and locked position", if you know what I
mean. He is a law-type professional, after all.

but yeah, depending on timeslot allottments, i might be down for an appearance.

Study: Meth Use Rare in Most of the U.S.

June 14,2006 | WASHINGTON -- Methamphetamine use is rare in most of the
United States, not the raging epidemic described by politicians and the
news media, says a study by an advocacy group.

Meth is a dangerous drug but among the least commonly used, The Sentencing
Project policy analyst Ryan King wrote in a report issued Wednesday. Rates
of use have been stable since 1999, and among teenagers meth use has
dropped, King said.

"The portrayal of methamphetamine in the United States as an epidemic
spreading across the country has been grossly overstated," King said. The
Sentencing Project is a not-for-profit group that supports alternatives to
prison terms for convicted drug users and other criminals.

Overheated rhetoric, unsupported assertions and factual errors about the
use of the drug -- including frequent, misguided comparisons between meth
and crack cocaine -- lead to poor decisions about how to spend precious
public dollars combating drug addiction, King said.

The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy did not immediately
comment on the report.

The report cites statistics compiled by the government to make its case,
including a 2004 survey that estimated 583,000 people used meth in the
past month, or two-10ths of 1 percent of the U.S. population. Four times
as many people use cocaine regularly and 30 times as many use marijuana,
King said.

A separate survey of high-school students showed a 36 percent drop in meth
use between 2001 and 2005.

The report acknowledged that methamphetamine is more widely used today
than it was 10 years ago. Data from the jail populations of a handful of
cities on the West Coast also show what King called a "highly localized"
problem.

Among men arrested in Phoenix, 38.3 percent tested positive for
methamphetamine. Figures for other cities are: Los Angeles, 28.7 percent;
Portland, Ore., 25.4; San Diego, 36.2 percent; and San Jose, Calif., 36.9
percent.

But nationally, just 5 percent of men who had been arrested had meth in
their systems. By contrast, 30 percent tested positive for cocaine and 44
percent for marijuana, the report said, citing government statistics.

Treatment programs for meth also have been portrayed inaccurately, with
news reports suggesting that meth users do not respond as well to
treatment as users of other drugs, King said. The Bush administration's
recent methamphetamine control strategy also referred to a "common
misperception that methamphetamine is so addictive that it is impossible
to treat."

Programs in 15 states have had promising results, King said.

"Mischaracterizing the impact of methamphetamine by exaggerating its
prevalence and consequences while downplaying its receptivity to treatment
succeeds neither as a tool of prevention nor a vehicle of education," he
wrote.

King called for a tempered approach to the problem, keeping the focus on
local trouble spots and using federal money to beef up treatment programs.

FWIW I went to get some loratadine-d (generic clariton D, has
psuedophedrine in it) at cvs.  Got my drivers license out and ready and
she said they don't have to do detailed logging of it.  They can just do
"how they logged it before".  I'm assuming they just log how much is
sold that day, although they do scan my cvs card so it does get logged
how many times I buy it so if I'm buying 15 packs of it every day,
something is probably up.  So at least I don't have to deal with that
BS.  I tried to have an argument about it at one point and they were
completely clueless to my argument that if people really want to get
their hands on large amounts of pseudophedrine, they're not going to buy
stuff over the counter.  they're going to find someone "in the know" to
get them some or just jack a delivery truck or something. o well

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Toronto-based producer and DJ Greg Gow, has long been a crowd favorite 
in Toronto.s electronic music scene.   As the founder of two 
internationally selling record labels, Restructured and Kombustion, Greg 
has fast become an ambassador for Canadian electronic music 
internationally. His rhythmical sensibility and technical talent has led 
Greg to join the ranks of premiere Canadian artists such as; DJ Preach, 
Misstress Barbara, John Acquaviva, Algorithm, Mateo Murphy and Richie 
Hawtin.

Early in his career Greg was exposed to various styles of music having 
attended warehouse events in Toronto and Detroit.  Initially, he 
collected hip hop records in the early nineties; but quickly gained 
recognition as a house music DJ on CHRY 105.5 FM York University radio.  
While Greg had established himself as a high-profile DJ in the Toronto 
house music circuit, his sound was rapidly evolving.  In 1996, 
influenced by the harder Detroit and German technological sounds, Greg 
traded his smooth house sound for dark atmospheric, intense and 
danceable techno. 

In 1997 the rave scene was exploding across Toronto, and it quickly 
became the ideal environment for Greg to display his hard rhythmic tones 
and technical brilliance.  Yet it was a fresh up-start techno production 
company, Phryl, where Greg.s stature of one of the top techno Djs in 
Canada was solidified.  Playing packed warehouses alongside 
international headliners such as; Adam Beyer, Joel Mull, Gaetano 
Parisio, Derrick May and Stacey Pullen.  His Phryl sets were regarded as 
brilliant and often overshadowed the top-billed acts he was playing 
with.  Greg was now a major player in the dance music scene in Toronto, 
and while the scene was shifting from warehouses to the more intimate 
club settings, he remained a staple in an ever-changing culture.

Greg Gow has enjoyed equal success as a promoter, DJ and Label Manager.  
Greg.s event production company Mono, was established in 2002 and is 
credited with bringing in some of the biggest names in Techno to 
Toronto.  Working with John Lickrish of Blue Bookings, Greg.s highly 
successful Mono events were hosted at various respected venues (System 
Soundbar, the Opera House and the Guvernment to name a few), bringing in 
talent such as; Richie Hawtin, Madga, Thomas Krome, Steve Bug and Speedy 
J. 

Greg.s DJ career was brought to the next level, when he signed with Blue 
Bookings.  This led to Greg.s well deserved association with other high 
caliber internationally touring DJs on the roster such as Marco Corola 
and Steve Bug.  He also had the opportunity to join Mauro Picotto on a 
mini tour, opening for him at Avalon  (formerly Limelight) in New York 
City and closing for Picotto in Toronto at the highly recognized 
Guvernment Nightclub, where Greg is frequently booked.  Presently, Greg 
holds down residencies at Toronto.s premiere electronic dance music 
destinations, System Soundbar, Comfort Zone and Film Lounge. 

Internationally, Greg has represented Toronto in Miami during the 2004 
Winter Music Conference at Privilege and this year at Space.  He has 
also played the legendary Detroit Movement Festival on the Techno Blvd. 
Stage, and was featured at the Tronic Treatment Party with Christian 
Smith in 2004. 

Ultimately it is Greg.s steady DJing career and his music productions 
that are leading to his ever-increasing recognition.  In the studio Greg 
combines analogue and digital equipment to compose banging climactic 
Detroit style techno that often features minor key stabs. His releases 
on labels including Seismic Detroit, Default, Zen, 2Wars and Tresor have 
garnered spins from top DJs Rush, Umek, and Mateo Murphy.

Greg.s own internationally selling labels; Restructured and Kombustion, 
feature his music and other artists. music from around the world.  
Restructured productions have been spotted in the crates of globe 
trotting DJs including Steve Rachmad and Ben Sims. In Chicago, Greg has 
played alongside DJ Frankie Vega and he is releasing tracks on Uppercut 
(a subsidiary of Dust Traxx). 

Greg has forthcoming releases including: the .Jack Theory EP. on Berrata 
Music (Detroit); .Eclipse. on Metapath; new tracks on Chris Liebing.s 
label Touchtone; and another on Omniscent (California). Restructured is 
releasing the .No Hockey EP. in Spring 2005 which features remixes of 
.Game 7. by fellow Canadians DJ Preach and Marco G.

Evidently, Greg Gow is a respected Canadian player in the game for the 
long-term with plans for 2005 and beyond. Music industry personages and 
fans can rest assured Greg Gow.s endeavors will live up to the calibre 
of excellence that he has thus far displayed.

Once again Tek-Know is proud to bring in some of the biggest talent in

and more.

Andy Vaz - Background Records, [--] - Germany
Andy Vaz hails from Düsseldorf, Germany. Andy manages and curates 
Background Recordings. Andy has been a pinnacle cornerstone of the 
German electronic music movement. He is highly regarded as one of the 
essential individuals on the global front for providing a cultural 
conduit for electronic music, between Düsseldorf, San Francisco, 
Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, London, South Africa and countless other 
cities around the world. Background recordings has been a major force in 
the presentation of minimal techno, introducing and educating the world 
to the geographic variable influences that exist within the genre.

In 2000, Andy Vaz has released his own material. After many years of 
work in the studio, Andy was reluctant to release his music. taking the 
time needed to polish and refine the sound, and feel that it was on par 
with his contemporaries, his first 12", "Sounds Variation 1-1" was met 
with incredible international acclaim. Sounds_variation is based on the 
use of the same sounds, re-used throughout, giving each track another 
musical approach by pushing each instrument in a different compositional 
direction by re-arrangement, toneshifting and by adding/changing effects 
in order to demonstrate that a defined production criteria brings forth 
maximal results through the process of limitation within a lo-fi 
aesthetic. The first edition of the Andy Vaz vinyl series on the elusive 
and nameless label is therefore entitled [---].

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).

John B
Beta Recordings, MMI
UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB
http://www.spreeandadb.com/
DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

The 3-Day Experience
The 12th Annual World Electronic Music Festival or simply the .3-Day. as
it.s become known over the years, is the 2006 installment of the largest
and longest running event of its kind in Canada. With a rich variety of
music, artists, performers and music lovers from around the world, it is
an experience that is unique and enduring for all those who have made it
part of their lives.

It is the 3-Day Experience that we invite you to enjoy once more and
potentially one last time. After searching across the province the WEMF
collective has chosen a site that will allow it to create an event that
is true to the roots of where WEMF came from and what it has become. A
remote, forested campground, located on a crystal clear lakefront will
bring all the music back outside where it belongs. Camping, dancing,
enjoying the company of friends and everything else that the 3-Day
Experience allows can only be enhanced by the presence of the sun and
the stars!

With this return to nature, we are also transforming the 3-Day
Experience to a themed environment that will create a completely new
level of connection and interaction with the music, the land and each
other. In 2006 all stages will be themed. Travel through the experience
by Air, Sea, Land and Space. Travel into your Mind and through Time into
the future. We invite those new and old to join us for a completely
fresh but quite likely final, 3-Day Experience!

Fri Jul 28                          CHUNK                         Cleveland

With the electronic dance music scene back on the rise in Ohio, TRU & 
DISCO productions feel that it is about that time to bring the noise 
harder than we ever have in these parts with an enormous event that is 
sure to rock your shit for 12 straight hours and guarantee you will 
remember this night for the rest of your lives! Of course Michael Mellon 
of TRU Productions and the legendary Disco Donnie of DISCO Productions 
are known around the nation for producing massive headliner events that 
cater to thousands, but this event right here, .CHUNK. is on another 
level. We are taking it back to the old school this time. We are proud 
to be working on this event with both Koala-Tea and ANM Productions to 
bring you what is set to be a 2000+ person event. And, maybe, the most 
talked-about event set for 2006!

We have 3 rooms of straight TURBO SOUND, unlimited amounts of production 
including the sickest light, laser and visuals show that will 100% fuck 
your mind up and take you on a major euphoric journey. Not to mention, 
METROPOLIS NIGHTCLUB. This venue is legendary! Cleveland.s 
longest-lasting superclub which has just been re-vamped with a brand new 
hardwood dance floor, new carpet and furniture; the VIP area cannot get 
any nicer. Did I mention the massive TURBO SOUND RIG and the hundreds of 
moving lights and lasers in a 20,000 square foot venue?

Get ready people, here it is! We are proud to bring you an event of this 
status with 5 major headliners on the bill alongside the best local and 
regional talent in the nation! Set this date aside, you know you want 
to. Make sure you get your tickets while they are HOT! We are releasing 
a very limited amount at a very cheap price to hook ya.ll up. After 
those sell out the price goes up. Tickets will be available on-line at 
WWW.WANTICKETS.COM or at GRAND POO-BAS RECORD SHOPPE located in 
Lakewood, Ohio on Detroit Rd. up until 5pm the day of the event.

See you all at CHUNK! Getcha truffle shuffle on! -PEACE

I bet they just wanted to pick a drug that had little use so that 
they could claim that there were "only [insert low number here] meth 
addicts after the crackdown on pseudoephedrine" but millions of 
conjested people due to the fact that the other alternatives don't 
seem to work.

Oh, Canada... haha...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} you mean they LIED to us?!!!

My theory has always been that the government cracks down on anything  
they don't have control over at any given time. Since anyone with a  
few basic tools and know how can make it in their basement/garage/ 
trailer/hotel room, they can't control the business. Things that have  
to be brought in over borders in large amounts or need obscene  
amounts of money laundered for tend to not have wars declared on  
them. You do the math.

Ok, I've been driving a lot and have been listening to coast2coast AM  
too much.

I use to listen to that all of the time, back when art bell was doing  
all of them.  Listened to it for the first itme in a few years last  
week when I had to go downtown at 4:00 am to do server maintenance  
(yeah, one of those "perks" of being an IT person, although i was  
still jet lagged at the time anyway).

interesting, Todd Eddy.

i keep my allergies under control with 24-hour sudafed.  i was at target
with my daughter and realizing i would be running out soon, l went to buy a
10-day supply, gave them my driver's license ... and was rejected!  they
told me the purchase would put me over what i am allowed to get.  i was
like, huh?  the cashier got the pharmacist who said the state / the store
allowed me so many grams per month.  i'm slow at math but i estimated and
said, but if the dosage is one a day, that rule only gets me through about
half a month.  so the pharmacist looked in their instore computer
guidelines and said, oh, the rule has changed.  it was revised so one could
actually buy what the recommended dosage was.  but he said i must have
bought some recently because their tracking system was disallowing me.  i
did have two or three tablets left, but since i was in the store with my id
i thought i'd get a little bit ahead of myself.  he smiled sympathetically
and said he was sorry but i'd have to come back.

it was sooo weird!

FWIW I went to get some loratadine-d (generic clariton D, has
psuedophedrine in it) at cvs.  Got my drivers license out and ready and
she said they don't have to do detailed logging of it.  They can just do
"how they logged it before".  I'm assuming they just log how much is
sold that day, although they do scan my cvs card so it does get logged
how many times I buy it so if I'm buying 15 packs of it every day,
something is probably up.  So at least I don't have to deal with that
BS.  I tried to have an argument about it at one point and they were
completely clueless to my argument that if people really want to get
their hands on large amounts of pseudophedrine, they're not going to buy
stuff over the counter.  they're going to find someone "in the know" to
get them some or just jack a delivery truck or something. o well

Welcome to jesusland.

Yeah, CVS seemed to be the last people to start doing detailed  
logging and now they're aparently one of the first to stop it.   
Although they may just be tracking it via my cvs card (which has my  
driver's license on file).  Not sure what would happen if I said I  
didn't have my card on me, have to try that next time.

200 sudafed (sudagest) tablets, $3.50, i'm pretty sure they're 15 or 20mg.

one lasts me about a year through my 2 bad allergy seasons (spring and fall)
and cold season.

then again, in college i took mini thins like breath mints, so i need a
little higher dose to actually do anything for me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG was Re: {pb-cle} Where's everyone going for the
 weekend?

Well, at least there'll be a pool if anyone catches fire.  Just have to
watch out for my fat ass that will probably be in the pool at the time
(yes, at 5:00 am, completely hammered.  Hmm... actually maybe I
shouldn't be in a pool and hammered... maybe if I can commandeer one of
those floating chairs with the beer can holder (or 'beverage holder' as
they like to advertise it as))

Just got an email from Apple that my Breaks FM show will now be available
for podcasting via iTunes.
 
http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=160730660
 
I have my last three shows up on there now.
 
For those w/o iTunes, but who have another podcast-friendly device, you can
still subscribe here:

Subject: {pb-cle} ASIO driver - music production

I found this link to an ASIO driver to use for many onboard sound cards that
don't have a good aiso driver.  Those of you that do sound production might
find it handy when using systems with sucky sound cards - especially laptops
or other motherboard cards.  Cuts delay response lag when triggering
sampling or applying control / effects.  Keep in mind, that if you have a
production quality sound card, that driver is probably better.  Anyhow, mad
props to this dude that wrote it, works great - I've used it with ableton
and cubase and its been flawless so far!

ASIO4ALL is a hardware independent low latency ASIO driver for WDM audio
devices. It uses WDM Kernel-Streaming and sometimes even more sophisticated
methods to achieve its objectives.

have fun!

or for like first 25 people that leave "because the sun is coming out
boo hoo I'm so emo".  Anyone that becomes involved in debauchery and
thus becoming a part of CDG history shall be exempt.  And anyone
involved with any of the sound production (I'm working on getting a rig
setup to record all the sets... hopefully... and I don't plan on being
too forgiving on the levels.  Remember red means bad and will make the
recording crappy since I don't know what state I'll be in to actually
monitor the recording levels.)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Anyone speak swedish, know c++, and want to program for propellerhead (reason)?

I got the C++ down, maybe I can find those tapes to learn sweedish in
my sleep; better yet, maybe I can skip the listening and just sleep
with some sweedish women =3DP Not sure that will work, or will it...

Thats is a choice programming position for sure ;)  They have been
softsynth pioneers for over 10 years.

Craze, Breakage, Scott Henry.

There's some old names - as is par for pretty much any party these
days - but a few new ones that are really good, as well.  Should be
great times.  :-)


I'm going to the Gaian Mind Summer Party.  Half psytrance, half
ambient/downtempo, at a gorgeous campground.  Great times, as well.


Just upset they both fell on the same weekend this year.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Starscape

Gaian Mind charges $85 presale; the campground charges about
$30ish/person for camping, which leaves the crew with $55/head to
setup, promote, and throw a 500 person party bringing in 20ish DJ's
across four days.

Starscape's a bigger shindig, albeit only one night.  No clue what
they charged this year...

Gaian mind is totally worth it, though. The location is beautiful, and
there's nothing like waking up to chill psytrance out in the wilderness.

We're leaving tomorrow morning. See you there!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Starscape

Starscape is $50 at the gate... kinda steep for a one nighter that's
not all that special.

http://www.gaian-mind.com/gmsf2k6.htm has said $110 for quite some time now.

WEMF is $75 right now.

FreqFest is $35 right now.

Same duration basically all 3.

I would probably have found a way to pay the $220 + $105 for meals for
Adrienne and I (I dunno, sold futures on my upcoming CDG hidden cam
video? "Geeks gone wild!") , but the people I want to hang with all
bailed based on price too, and I'm not sure I'm a big enuf fan to do 3
days of downtempo and psy.

Yeah the wife and I both really want to go to this, it will be tough
to muster up enough mojo to make it there with wemf before, and
FreqFest after.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

Once again Tek-Know is proud to bring in some of the biggest talent in 
the techno scene for you listening enjoyment. We will be pulling out the

and more.

Andy Vaz - Background Records, [--] - Germany
Andy Vaz hails from Düsseldorf, Germany. Andy manages and curates 
Background Recordings. Andy has been a pinnacle cornerstone of the 
German electronic music movement. He is highly regarded as one of the 
essential individuals on the global front for providing a cultural 
conduit for electronic music, between Düsseldorf, San Francisco, 
Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, London, South Africa and countless other 
cities around the world. Background recordings has been a major force in 
the presentation of minimal techno, introducing and educating the world 
to the geographic variable influences that exist within the genre.

In 2000, Andy Vaz has released his own material. After many years of 
work in the studio, Andy was reluctant to release his music. taking the 
time needed to polish and refine the sound, and feel that it was on par 
with his contemporaries, his first 12", "Sounds Variation 1-1" was met 
with incredible international acclaim. Sounds_variation is based on the 
use of the same sounds, re-used throughout, giving each track another 
musical approach by pushing each instrument in a different compositional 
direction by re-arrangement, toneshifting and by adding/changing effects 
in order to demonstrate that a defined production criteria brings forth 
maximal results through the process of limitation within a lo-fi 
aesthetic. The first edition of the Andy Vaz vinyl series on the elusive 
and nameless label is therefore entitled [---].

This hometown show stealer is ready willing and working overtime to

NINJA'S of MINIMAL MADNESS: Jimi Tsang & Jason Allen
Mentor (Tsang) and apprentice (Allen) have combined their differences in 
music preference to deliver dance floors a ball of minimal wax that 
penetrates your left ear, melts your brain for 37 nanoseconds, then 
exits the right ear leaving you on the floor saying "holy eargasm 
batman!". Listen to the ninja's of minimal madness kick you in the ear 
with the bleeps, the sweeps and the creeps!

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).



John B

John B
Beta Recordings, MMI
UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB

DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

with John K

Hailing from Houston, Texas, Henry Chow brings a fresh new sound to the 
international Techno community. Behind his calm facade, Chow - also 
using the .Stealth. moniker in local scene - was developing a technique 
that would create an outlet and make people feel that he had spoken his 
peace. The Chinese-American Henry Chow began his ventures into a DJ 
persona in late 1996. Initially, he was unable to categorize his 
efforts. However, this detriment proved to bless Chow with the 
background necessary to present his preferred style openly. Being 
influenced by the hip hop culture at an early age, Henry wanted new mix 
tapes to breakdance to so he found himself buying two turntables and a 
load of hip hop classics. After several trips to the local vinyl shops, 
Henry opened his mind to other forms of music and began experimenting 
with drum & bass, house and eventually techno.

It was through techno that Chow felt he could move the crowd. "Techno 
has no boundaries. Being repetitive and minimal, It was no secret that 
techno was made for manipulation. It's all about manipulation; 
Manipulating the tracks and the crowd,. says Henry Chow. Debuting to 
Houston masses at a Lone Star Arena rave, the Stealth was no longer 
covert after a bangin. crafty set.

By 1999 Henry Chow joined forces with Steve Sheffield and long time 
friends, Fernando Cortez and Thomas Cauley, and the four DJs created the 
Houston-based Tek-Xupport. The techno clique soon began taking over the 
airwaves on Friday nights on the local KTRU 91.7 FM .MK Ultra. program, 
which showcases local talent to the masses or those within range. It was 
within this earshot that Chow sought to expand. Ultimately, Tek-Xupport 
combined forces with Jeff Fleischmann and his 713Tekno project. In a 
colliding of minds, a true force to be reckoned with has emerged. Now a 
staple of the burgeoning Houston techno scene, Henry Chow, Tek-Xupport 
and 713Tekno create an innovative outlet needed to move techno up to the 
top more prominently.
 
Shortly after, Chow and 713Tekno brought their sound to Hardrive.s Club 
Karma and established a monthly residence. Adjusting his, now, versatile 
style, Chow brought his offensive to a string of local underground 
warehouse parties, where the acoustics also hollered for techno to 
resound, and spilling techno throughout the surrounding blocks. With 
growing support, Chow was able to feed the techno masses as Static 
Wednesdays' techno resident at Houston's premiere nightclub Hyperia.
 
Fully realizing the potential of his furtive movements and in furthering 
the Stealth moniker, he felt that there was a need to write and produce 
to keep the music fresh and alive in Houston. After about three years of 
writing and producing techno music, in late 2003, Chow signed on with 
Marco Carola and Corrado Izzo's Zenit imprint.  ©Fahrenheit-media.com,

The 3-Day Experience
The 12th Annual World Electronic Music Festival or simply the .3-Day. as
it.s become known over the years, is the 2006 installment of the largest
and longest running event of its kind in Canada. With a rich variety of
music, artists, performers and music lovers from around the world, it is
an experience that is unique and enduring for all those who have made it
part of their lives.

It is the 3-Day Experience that we invite you to enjoy once more and
potentially one last time. After searching across the province the WEMF
collective has chosen a site that will allow it to create an event that
is true to the roots of where WEMF came from and what it has become. A
remote, forested campground, located on a crystal clear lakefront will
bring all the music back outside where it belongs. Camping, dancing,
enjoying the company of friends and everything else that the 3-Day
Experience allows can only be enhanced by the presence of the sun and
the stars!

With this return to nature, we are also transforming the 3-Day
Experience to a themed environment that will create a completely new
level of connection and interaction with the music, the land and each
other. In 2006 all stages will be themed. Travel through the experience
by Air, Sea, Land and Space. Travel into your Mind and through Time into
the future. We invite those new and old to join us for a completely
fresh but quite likely final, 3-Day Experience!

Fri Jul 28                          CHUNK                         Cleveland

With the electronic dance music scene back on the rise in Ohio, TRU & 
DISCO productions feel that it is about that time to bring the noise 
harder than we ever have in these parts with an enormous event that is 
sure to rock your shit for 12 straight hours and guarantee you will 
remember this night for the rest of your lives! Of course Michael Mellon 
of TRU Productions and the legendary Disco Donnie of DISCO Productions 
are known around the nation for producing massive headliner events that 
cater to thousands, but this event right here, .CHUNK. is on another 
level. We are taking it back to the old school this time. We are proud 
to be working on this event with both Koala-Tea and ANM Productions to 
bring you what is set to be a 2000+ person event. And, maybe, the most 
talked-about event set for 2006!

We have 3 rooms of straight TURBO SOUND, unlimited amounts of production 
including the sickest light, laser and visuals show that will 100% fuck 
your mind up and take you on a major euphoric journey. Not to mention, 
METROPOLIS NIGHTCLUB. This venue is legendary! Cleveland.s 
longest-lasting superclub which has just been re-vamped with a brand new 
hardwood dance floor, new carpet and furniture; the VIP area cannot get 
any nicer. Did I mention the massive TURBO SOUND RIG and the hundreds of 
moving lights and lasers in a 20,000 square foot venue?

Get ready people, here it is! We are proud to bring you an event of this 
status with 5 major headliners on the bill alongside the best local and 
regional talent in the nation! Set this date aside, you know you want 
to. Make sure you get your tickets while they are HOT! We are releasing 
a very limited amount at a very cheap price to hook ya.ll up. After 
those sell out the price goes up. Tickets will be available on-line at 
WWW.WANTICKETS.COM or at GRAND POO-BAS RECORD SHOPPE located in 
Lakewood, Ohio on Detroit Rd. up until 5pm the day of the event.

See you all at CHUNK! Getcha truffle shuffle on! -PEACE

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Starscape

I haven't heard about FreqFest, at all.  Looks like a decent party,
but at a venue that's essentially just a field with porta-pots.  I'd
*love* to see Gein, to be honest.  Here's to hoping they do *really*
well, and keep that one going.  :-)

Gaian Mind is a relatively small (500 people?), limited-appeal event.
Generally means they're going to have to charge more, as they
regularly bring in talent from all over.  Seriously, going in with
'meh' expectations, Deviant Species last year was kinda like listening
to a Hawtin set on steroids.  The early presale this year was $85, and
every year I've gone, it's been more than good enough to justify that
one for me.  On the other hand, it's a limited-appeal event.  :-)

Starscape was a $30 presale, and save years with torrential rain, has
been probably the best east coast massive I've seen.

WEMF always confuses me, though.  Unless they booked a wider range of
DJ's than years gone by.

I think WEMF actually has a stage for bands this year, too.

I haven't heard about FreqFest, at all.  Looks like a decent party,
but at a venue that's essentially just a field with porta-pots.  I'd
*love* to see Gein, to be honest.  Here's to hoping they do *really*
well, and keep that one going.  :-)

Gaian Mind is a relatively small (500 people?), limited-appeal event.
Generally means they're going to have to charge more, as they
regularly bring in talent from all over.  Seriously, going in with
'meh' expectations, Deviant Species last year was kinda like listening
to a Hawtin set on steroids.  The early presale this year was $85, and
every year I've gone, it's been more than good enough to justify that
one for me.  On the other hand, it's a limited-appeal event.  :-)

Starscape was a $30 presale, and save years with torrential rain, has
been probably the best east coast massive I've seen.

WEMF always confuses me, though.  Unless they booked a wider range of
DJ's than years gone by.

Well...
I have been wanting to see MMW in a rave setting for EVAR!

So fuck all else

Plus both Shimon and Red One tore it up in miami, and I'm sure they'll 
be FUCKEN SHEIT UP, totally HARDCORE stylee.

I've never seen Subfocus, Michael Myers, Breakage, East Coast Boogiemen, 
or DJ Who before. And I'm getting pretty EXCITED.

It was bound to happen in a country that has more amiga demos than

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

and more.

Andy Vaz - Background Records, [--] - Germany
Andy Vaz hails from Düsseldorf, Germany. Andy manages and curates 
Background Recordings. Andy has been a pinnacle cornerstone of the 
German electronic music movement. He is highly regarded as one of the 
essential individuals on the global front for providing a cultural 
conduit for electronic music, between Düsseldorf, San Francisco, 
Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, London, South Africa and countless other 
cities around the world. Background recordings has been a major force in 
the presentation of minimal techno, introducing and educating the world 
to the geographic variable influences that exist within the genre.

In 2000, Andy Vaz has released his own material. After many years of 
work in the studio, Andy was reluctant to release his music. taking the 
time needed to polish and refine the sound, and feel that it was on par 
with his contemporaries, his first 12", "Sounds Variation 1-1" was met 
with incredible international acclaim. Sounds_variation is based on the 
use of the same sounds, re-used throughout, giving each track another 
musical approach by pushing each instrument in a different compositional 
direction by re-arrangement, toneshifting and by adding/changing effects 
in order to demonstrate that a defined production criteria brings forth 
maximal results through the process of limitation within a lo-fi 
aesthetic. The first edition of the Andy Vaz vinyl series on the elusive 
and nameless label is therefore entitled [---].

NINJA'S of MINIMAL MADNESS: Jimi Tsang & Jason Allen
Mentor (Tsang) and apprentice (Allen) have combined their differences in

batman!". Listen to the ninja's of minimal madness kick you in the ear

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).

John B
Beta Recordings, MMI
UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB
http://www.spreeandadb.com/
DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

Sat Jul 15                       HENRY CHOW                       Cleveland

Globalbooking presents....

Saturday July 15th@ Touch
Henry Chow (Houston)

doors - 10:00pm 
$7.00

www.globalbooking.net

www.touchohiocity.com

with John K

Hailing from Houston, Texas, Henry Chow brings a fresh new sound to the 
international Techno community. Behind his calm facade, Chow - also 
using the .Stealth. moniker in local scene - was developing a technique 
that would create an outlet and make people feel that he had spoken his 
peace. The Chinese-American Henry Chow began his ventures into a DJ 
persona in late 1996. Initially, he was unable to categorize his 
efforts. However, this detriment proved to bless Chow with the 
background necessary to present his preferred style openly. Being 
influenced by the hip hop culture at an early age, Henry wanted new mix 
tapes to breakdance to so he found himself buying two turntables and a 
load of hip hop classics. After several trips to the local vinyl shops, 
Henry opened his mind to other forms of music and began experimenting 
with drum & bass, house and eventually techno.

It was through techno that Chow felt he could move the crowd. "Techno 
has no boundaries. Being repetitive and minimal, It was no secret that 
techno was made for manipulation. It's all about manipulation; 
Manipulating the tracks and the crowd,. says Henry Chow. Debuting to 
Houston masses at a Lone Star Arena rave, the Stealth was no longer 
covert after a bangin. crafty set.

By 1999 Henry Chow joined forces with Steve Sheffield and long time 
friends, Fernando Cortez and Thomas Cauley, and the four DJs created the 
Houston-based Tek-Xupport. The techno clique soon began taking over the 
airwaves on Friday nights on the local KTRU 91.7 FM .MK Ultra. program, 
which showcases local talent to the masses or those within range. It was 
within this earshot that Chow sought to expand. Ultimately, Tek-Xupport 
combined forces with Jeff Fleischmann and his 713Tekno project. In a 
colliding of minds, a true force to be reckoned with has emerged. Now a 
staple of the burgeoning Houston techno scene, Henry Chow, Tek-Xupport 
and 713Tekno create an innovative outlet needed to move techno up to the 
top more prominently.
 
Shortly after, Chow and 713Tekno brought their sound to Hardrive.s Club 
Karma and established a monthly residence. Adjusting his, now, versatile 
style, Chow brought his offensive to a string of local underground 
warehouse parties, where the acoustics also hollered for techno to 
resound, and spilling techno throughout the surrounding blocks. With 
growing support, Chow was able to feed the techno masses as Static 
Wednesdays' techno resident at Houston's premiere nightclub Hyperia.
 
Fully realizing the potential of his furtive movements and in furthering 
the Stealth moniker, he felt that there was a need to write and produce 
to keep the music fresh and alive in Houston. After about three years of 
writing and producing techno music, in late 2003, Chow signed on with 
Marco Carola and Corrado Izzo's Zenit imprint.  ©Fahrenheit-media.com,

FRIDAY . SATURDAY . SUNDAY

The 3-Day Experience
The 12th Annual World Electronic Music Festival or simply the .3-Day. as
it.s become known over the years, is the 2006 installment of the largest
and longest running event of its kind in Canada. With a rich variety of
music, artists, performers and music lovers from around the world, it is
an experience that is unique and enduring for all those who have made it
part of their lives.

It is the 3-Day Experience that we invite you to enjoy once more and
potentially one last time. After searching across the province the WEMF
collective has chosen a site that will allow it to create an event that
is true to the roots of where WEMF came from and what it has become. A
remote, forested campground, located on a crystal clear lakefront will
bring all the music back outside where it belongs. Camping, dancing,
enjoying the company of friends and everything else that the 3-Day
Experience allows can only be enhanced by the presence of the sun and
the stars!

With this return to nature, we are also transforming the 3-Day
Experience to a themed environment that will create a completely new
level of connection and interaction with the music, the land and each
other. In 2006 all stages will be themed. Travel through the experience
by Air, Sea, Land and Space. Travel into your Mind and through Time into
the future. We invite those new and old to join us for a completely
fresh but quite likely final, 3-Day Experience!

Fri Jul 28                          CHUNK                         Cleveland

With the electronic dance music scene back on the rise in Ohio, TRU & 
DISCO productions feel that it is about that time to bring the noise 
harder than we ever have in these parts with an enormous event that is 
sure to rock your shit for 12 straight hours and guarantee you will 
remember this night for the rest of your lives! Of course Michael Mellon 
of TRU Productions and the legendary Disco Donnie of DISCO Productions 
are known around the nation for producing massive headliner events that 
cater to thousands, but this event right here, .CHUNK. is on another 
level. We are taking it back to the old school this time. We are proud 
to be working on this event with both Koala-Tea and ANM Productions to 
bring you what is set to be a 2000+ person event. And, maybe, the most 
talked-about event set for 2006!

We have 3 rooms of straight TURBO SOUND, unlimited amounts of production 
including the sickest light, laser and visuals show that will 100% fuck 
your mind up and take you on a major euphoric journey. Not to mention, 
METROPOLIS NIGHTCLUB. This venue is legendary! Cleveland.s 
longest-lasting superclub which has just been re-vamped with a brand new 
hardwood dance floor, new carpet and furniture; the VIP area cannot get 
any nicer. Did I mention the massive TURBO SOUND RIG and the hundreds of 
moving lights and lasers in a 20,000 square foot venue?

Get ready people, here it is! We are proud to bring you an event of this 
status with 5 major headliners on the bill alongside the best local and 
regional talent in the nation! Set this date aside, you know you want 
to. Make sure you get your tickets while they are HOT! We are releasing 
a very limited amount at a very cheap price to hook ya.ll up. After 
those sell out the price goes up. Tickets will be available on-line at 
WWW.WANTICKETS.COM or at GRAND POO-BAS RECORD SHOPPE located in 
Lakewood, Ohio on Detroit Rd. up until 5pm the day of the event.

See you all at CHUNK! Getcha truffle shuffle on! -PEACE

2) if anyone has a grill or grills (the cooking kind, not your teeth nick)
they can bring from the akron area (charcoal preferred, just one of dem
cheap bitch's), we are still in need of one.

3) if you havent received an invitation via evite or myspace and you think
you should have, or you just want to come, email myself or trout.

4) no markers, nick

5) there will be open tables throughout the day from 12-5ish prior to the
lineup starting, so if you have good music and know how to operate 2
turntables and a mixer, bring records.

6) if anyone can get Evenstay Angtsay to the party, you will receive the
2006 Medal of Opiate Thwartation (the highest award given to a member of the
CIA, puts the medal of honor to shame).

7) Dont forget to bring a towel.

darn and here I thought you wanted me to wear them :)

I gotta find me one of those foam chairs with the beer can holder.   
Or just find me an inner tube.  Anytime something is flooded there's  
always the obligatory guy on inner tube with beer can.

Todd,

I fully expect you to be buck naked by midnight, perhaps wearing the innertube!

I dunno, the hype of this event surely can't be realized.

It's just not possible!

Dan K

p.s. Who's coming to Pittsburgh for Freedom with a view on July 4th?
Gonna have a mad afterparty at our house. Hit me up for the address.

Nah!

Hmm your email was supposed to reduce the hype but I think it actually
brought it to another level.

I need to pick up some damn big / good steaks cause I'm going to need
the energy to make it through the whole night without passing out. I'm
not trusting any of you bitches :)

Well, at CDG3 I believe I was going to get drunk and tell /something/  
(forget what it was now) to get in my bellah (like in austin  
powers).  That never happened.  So yeah I'll run around buck naked  
before midnight.  as saying such a thing immediately makes it not  
happen.   Hmm... I'm going to not not make out with hot chicks.  and  
I'm not not going to get $50 from everyone that sees me.

I: don't not suck

Subject: {pb-cle} Goahead in Chicago

Moke and I will see you in Chicago July 5!!

Psymbolic presents:
onomatopoeia wednesdays

Wed. July 5

Luke Malachi - Goahead - [Cleveland, OH]
Malachi began dj'ing psy/goa in 1999 and founded Goahead Productions
in Cleveland Ohio. With an emphasis on showcasing multiple forms of
art and providing an audio/visual journey, Goahead events have
received much positive feedback. Over the past year Malachi has
started placing more focus on piecing together and dj'ing well-thought
out psymbient sets.

Moke - Goahead - [Cleveland, OH]
One of the original members of Ohio's Goahead Productions, Moke has
been producing and dj'ing for 10 years. He's most well known for his
mind bending psy/goa sets and has roots in tribal progressive and
techno. He is making the trip out with Malachi to explore his
psymbient experimetal side. This should be quite a journey with the
volumes of music he has collected over the years.

Well, I'm going to try to make it this year since it's just a hop, skip and
a jump away from where I live.  Dare I say that this will be my first one?!

driver...lol!!  The man doesn't drink as much as I do, surprisingly.

Yeah I just called Matt Monroe (soulglo) and he says it's going on.

I'll probably see you there. I may even have Trout in tow.

It looks like a non stop party week.

Sat: Bday party at my house for Eric.
Sun: still partying from saturday, then go blow bubbles at the point
in huge bubblefest.
Mon: Phil K
Tues: Freedom with a view, rave and watch fireworks on the 9th floor
downtown pgh, oh yeah.
Wed 3am: After party at my house for Freedom with a view.

So much partying so little serotonin.
