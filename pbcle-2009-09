             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Sep 05                          EARTH                        Pittsburgh

B.A.D. Ass. & Family welcomes you to join us,
as we celebrate one night of music & art under a Full Moon on.

EARTH

Saturday September 5th, 2009
It.s a PB/CLE thing.

Presenting our very own PB/CLE locals, OLD and NEW!

Darw_n
(United Groove, Psychoactive, www.jointhedemonstration.com ~ CLE)
Bringing upwards of 20 years involvement to the midwest dance scene, 
darw_n returns to pittsburgh after a long hiatus to lay down his 4 deck 
assault. Being a long time regular to pittsburgh during the party era of 
the 90's, come and re-experience his driving, mental tech house sets, or 
come get your mind blown for the first time.


Funkreformer
(Funkreform Productions, Housefusion ~ PB)
Funkreformer (a.k.a. Mr. Miles) was introduced to house music back in 
1991, and hasn.t looked back since. In 1993 he got ahold of his first 
pair of decks and began a lifelong love affair with percussion. He had 
regular monthly appearances on the now-legendary Free Radio Carson 91.7 
for years and held down quite a few residencies and guest appearances in 
local nightspots such as Lava Lounge, Metropol, and the infamous 
afterhours club Liquified. Blending the many different shades of House, 
Minimal and Techno, this guy is especially known for his ability to 
smoothly progress his sets from one mood to the next, taking his 
audience on a journey like never before heard. Better buckle up folks.


Moose
(Breakbeat Militia, Infinite Velocity ~ CLE)
Ever since kindergarten, moose has been making mixtapes. Well, probably 
not the type of mixtapes you're thinking of, but rather, radio tapes. 
Moose wanted to be a DJ on the radio so bad, that he and friends would 
make tapes with a tape recorder, a microphone, and songs recorded off of 
the radio. Since then, DJing has become more then just a dream for moose 
by establishing himself as a well recognized name in the Pittsburgh / 
Cleveland / Columbus / Cincinnati rave scenes. Moose spun at his first 
party in August of 1999; Nuclear Confusion thrown by Infinite Velocity 
Productions in Johnstown, PA. Soon after, he was asked to join Infinite 
Velocity's roster, an affiliation that moose has always cherished and 
valued. Since then, moose has spun at countless events all around Ohio 
and Pennsylvania.

Clevr
(Nex Nap, Breakbeat Militia ~ PB)
Clevr was born at a discotech in the middle of the dance floor and so he 
was destined to rock the masses. He has been controlling crowds behind 
the decks since 1997. You are sure to hear a funky and energized set of 
House and Breaks when Clevr is on the wheels. A crowd pleaser to the 
core he never fails to get the job done.

Fuzz
(United Groove, Psychoactive ~ CLE)
As one of the original Psychoactive members Fuzz has earned quite the 
reputation as a floor shaker. From the utterly massive 420 to the rock 
solid weeklies he was a part of,  every set of his pumps a level of
energy that fills the dancefloor with the perfect vibe. Now with the 
return of Psychoactive to the Cleveland scene Fuzz is sure to make his 
mark once again.

DJ 1 Auxy
(Tek-know?,  Factor Fiction, Re(vision) ~ CLE)

JTS
(FUZZ, 412dnb.com ~ PB)

DJ Leash
(Goodvibes Ent, Electronic Enlightenment ~ CLE)

Adonis
(B.A.D. Ass., NPP ~ PB)

DJ Tanner
(Full House ~ PB)

Jason Cuban
(Full House ~ PB)

Sunset til Sunrise
(Sunset til Sunrise Recordings ~ PB)

RM
(New Ascension ~ PB)

Sean 216
(GLO, Good Lookin Out ~ PB/CLE)

Allbe
(www.djallbe.com ~ PB)

Brian Thomas
(Drunken Monk ~ PB)

Gilly
(PB)


1 STAGE, 1 VIBE, 1 LOVE. B.A.D. Ass. & Family invite you to join us as 
we embark on mother nature herself for a day of fun filled activities 
and a night of Full Moon MADNESS!   During the day, we encourage 
everyone to bring along their Frisbees, footballs, horseshoes and 
whatever other outdoor games you enjoy! During the night,  glow toys and 
flashlights are a MUST! We would also like to present a full PB/CLE dj 
line-up for your listening pleasure. From the old, to the new, these 
PB/CLE performers are ready to rock your socks with an assortment of 
music that everyone can enjoy.  EARTH will also showcase a variety of 
artists from the PB/CLE region. Feed a starving artist, take home a 
souvenir!  Speaking of feeding, community grills will be on site for all 
your cooking needs. Call it a BBQ, call it a PARTY, call it GATHERING.

Thu Sep 17                          RUSKO                         Cleveland

Veering away from the dark, serious side of the sound, Rusko brought a 
highly driven energy and fun approach to the dubstep massive and quickly 
coined his own take on the genre and turned the scene upside down. His 
sound appealed to many people outside of the dubstep world as his 
productions became more adventurous in formula, sound and energy. His 
huge hit .Cockney Thug. has been played by everyone from Pete Tong, 
Switch, Diplo and Santogold and has been remixed by Buraka Som sistema, 
Diplo, Drop the Lime and the Scratch Perverts.

His sound continues to develop with different BPM.s that lean to jungle, 
house, hip hop or electro ... but regardless of BPM or tempo.you can 
immediately tell a Rusko track.

At 23, Rusko is only in 1st gear, with collaborations on the table with 
the likes of Switch, Diplo , Yo Majesty and Wiley, the future sure is 
looking bright. Already setting the radio airwaves alight with his own 
productions and remixes of artists such as Adele, A-Trak featuring Kid 
Sister, Leon Jean-Marie Rusko is only going in one direction. Onwards, 
upwards and far beyond any producer could dream of. Rusko is like Dr 
Dre, Timbaland and Switch all rolled into one with a serious overdose of 
bass.

>From those who make time travel possible, we are proud to bring you 1.21 
Jigawatts?!

Featuring the awesome talent of:

Technical Itch
LA//Drum and Bass

Labled by his fans as "the dark don of drum and bass", Mark Caro, AKA 
Technical Itch has infiltrated the masses worldwide with his dark sound 
for over a decade. His record label, Tech Itch recordings has played an 
influential part in the world wide DnB scene since 1993. Tech Itch is

Tranz am
(1st Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
San Franscico///Hardcore
//powerinmusic.com, triatom, loveallstars, San Fransisco hardcore//

This guy enjoys rockin' all types of Hardcore, especially the Freeform 
beats, but behind the scenes he plays it all. Yep that's right from 
house to hardcore and every genre in between. He has ventured into it 
and it keeps him on his toes. His main background consists of Breaks, 
Hard House, NRG, & Trance. Before he got into spinning Hardcore in 2005, 
he was actually spinning a lot of deep funky house. Tranz Am is a strong 
believer in the people, together they can move mountains, whatever they 
desire. There is power in the people, and power in music! Tranz AM is 
here to bring you positive vibes and good times, to bring you just a 
little closer to the sun. So when you see him up there on the decks 
don't be bashful, just get on the floor and burn it up!

Ronstoppable
(1st Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
Baltimore//Breaks & Electro
//ID Productions, Breakout Crew//

Ron got started spinning breaks in 2001. He dove straight into Flordia 
breaks and then UK breaks caught his fancy. He is known to mix some 
funky electro house into his sets to help him burn up the dance floors. 
He is currently a resident at Shorty's in B.More (previously owned by 
the legendary Charles Feelgood), as well as Liberty in Philly. He has 
been bangin' it out in clubs all up and down the east coast. We are 
proud to bring his floor rumbling sounds to the Steel City!

DVS
(Happy Birthday!!)
Pittsburgh//The funkiest house you have ever heard.
B.A.D. Ass, Koala-tea

Here is a man we all know and love. He hardly needs an introduction. 
With his undeniable stage presence and funky track selection he will 
keep your feet moving your, booty bouncing, and your face grinning for 
the entire set he's playing. His energy on stage is unstoppable. Truly a 
sight to be seen. Don't miss out on this wild man!!

DJ Firefly
www.djfirefly.com, www.myspace.com/couchdancing
Pittsburgh//deep, intoxicating sounds

Firefly grew up surrounded by music. Needless to say, this has rubbed 
off on her quite a bit. Wanting to spread her love of music, she began 
hosting a weekly radio show in 2005. Make sure you check her out 
Wednesdays from 3-5:30pm on WRTC (88.3) for some intoxicating deep 
sounds. She has held a residency at the Firehouse Lounge in the strip as 
well as other clubs around the burgh. Don't miss out on her beautiful 
sounds this night!

CO2
Pittsburgh area//Techno sexiness
Technoir Audio

Chris began his djing experience in 1998 when he bought his first 
turntables. This is a man who loves microwaves and hates video games 
that cost more than 25 cents. His love of techno began when he realized 
that mainstream radio was crap and he was hunting for a sound that was 
"new" and "better". Techno was an obvious choice for him since he still 
needs to hunt for "that" sound. He will be here this night to deliver 
what he has found to you!

Doverspike and ?????
Pittsburgh//Crazy Electro and more!
1337

Doverspike is A local Experimental/Mashup Ragga/Breakcore/Noise/Fucked

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

Thu Sep 17                          RUSKO                         Cleveland

Veering away from the dark, serious side of the sound, Rusko brought a 
highly driven energy and fun approach to the dubstep massive and quickly 
coined his own take on the genre and turned the scene upside down. His 
sound appealed to many people outside of the dubstep world as his 
productions became more adventurous in formula, sound and energy. His 
huge hit .Cockney Thug. has been played by everyone from Pete Tong, 
Switch, Diplo and Santogold and has been remixed by Buraka Som sistema, 
Diplo, Drop the Lime and the Scratch Perverts.

His sound continues to develop with different BPM.s that lean to jungle, 
house, hip hop or electro ... but regardless of BPM or tempo.you can 
immediately tell a Rusko track.

At 23, Rusko is only in 1st gear, with collaborations on the table with 
the likes of Switch, Diplo , Yo Majesty and Wiley, the future sure is 
looking bright. Already setting the radio airwaves alight with his own 
productions and remixes of artists such as Adele, A-Trak featuring Kid 
Sister, Leon Jean-Marie Rusko is only going in one direction. Onwards, 
upwards and far beyond any producer could dream of. Rusko is like Dr 
Dre, Timbaland and Switch all rolled into one with a serious overdose of 
bass.

Sat Sep 26                      TERRY MULLAN                      Cleveland

Saturday, September 26, 2009
Anatomy Ultra Lounge
Cleveland, Ohio
1299 W. 9th St
Cleveland, OH
	
Terry Mullan's back again to drop some funky tunes for us heads! 
Featured on the rooftop patio of Anatomy with residents 7UP, Elysium & 
Evan Evolution!

Being a fan of music sometimes means nothing else matters. This is true 
to life for Chicago.s Terry Mullan. His ears were alert at the right 
time, if house music is your thing. Right smack in the middle of the 
blossoming house development of Chicago during the mid 80's, at an early 
age, Terry was already in tune with what was actually happening.

Although his roots began in hip-hop, Terry found himself smack in the 
middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of 
music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. 
Faithfully listening and recording the then burgeoning Chicago airwaves, 
his nights during middle school were filled with the finest in Chicago 
house. DJ's like Farley .Jackmaster. funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, & Mike 
"Hitman" Wilson, via 102.7 WBMX. His mix tape collection fast became a 
fixture within his bedroom, constantly taping the shows, studying them. 
Some called it simulcasted education.

Soon after the house scene was all grown up, entered the acid house 
sound. Here Terry really found solace. It was that added flavor he was 
waiting for, something new, twisted, and forward. Now all the elements 
were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this 
was it, three different languages, disco, house, and techno. They could 
all translate the same message together or apart from one another. This 
is how Terry is like a translator. With his fluent style, these 
languages reflect his DJ.ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, 
which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This 
sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, 
Control, Funk.d, CHC, Aciiieeed and on his own imprint Catalyst 
Recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of 
DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Tyree Cooper, Halo Varga, Mazi, Dan Curtin, Bryan 
Zentz, Angel Alanis, & TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, 
Acid OG.s, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin Project on 
Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva.s former imprint Definitive which 
featured Terry.s track .Sidewinder. on the Chemical Brothers .Brother.s 
Gonna. Work It Out. Mix CD. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his 
records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely 
successful .Products Of Our Environment. EP on Catalyst which was 
featured on Pete Tong.s Essential Selection on BBC Radio 1 in the UK & 
"La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk" EP on Smile which was licensed to several 
top DJ mix compilations. (Terry Mullan & Halo Varga collaboration).

Terry.s DJ.ing, label, and trax have earned him a reputation that 
extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each 
genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass 
twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Thu Sep 17                          RUSKO                         Cleveland

Veering away from the dark, serious side of the sound, Rusko brought a 
highly driven energy and fun approach to the dubstep massive and quickly 
coined his own take on the genre and turned the scene upside down. His 
sound appealed to many people outside of the dubstep world as his 
productions became more adventurous in formula, sound and energy. His 
huge hit .Cockney Thug. has been played by everyone from Pete Tong, 
Switch, Diplo and Santogold and has been remixed by Buraka Som sistema, 
Diplo, Drop the Lime and the Scratch Perverts.

His sound continues to develop with different BPM.s that lean to jungle, 
house, hip hop or electro ... but regardless of BPM or tempo.you can 
immediately tell a Rusko track.

At 23, Rusko is only in 1st gear, with collaborations on the table with 
the likes of Switch, Diplo , Yo Majesty and Wiley, the future sure is 
looking bright. Already setting the radio airwaves alight with his own 
productions and remixes of artists such as Adele, A-Trak featuring Kid 
Sister, Leon Jean-Marie Rusko is only going in one direction. Onwards, 
upwards and far beyond any producer could dream of. Rusko is like Dr 
Dre, Timbaland and Switch all rolled into one with a serious overdose of 
bass.

Sat Sep 26                      TERRY MULLAN                      Cleveland

Saturday, September 26, 2009
Anatomy Ultra Lounge
Cleveland, Ohio
1299 W. 9th St
Cleveland, OH
	
Terry Mullan's back again to drop some funky tunes for us heads! 
Featured on the rooftop patio of Anatomy with residents 7UP, Elysium & 
Evan Evolution!

Being a fan of music sometimes means nothing else matters. This is true 
to life for Chicago.s Terry Mullan. His ears were alert at the right 
time, if house music is your thing. Right smack in the middle of the 
blossoming house development of Chicago during the mid 80's, at an early 
age, Terry was already in tune with what was actually happening.

Although his roots began in hip-hop, Terry found himself smack in the 
middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of 
music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. 
Faithfully listening and recording the then burgeoning Chicago airwaves, 
his nights during middle school were filled with the finest in Chicago 
house. DJ's like Farley .Jackmaster. funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, & Mike 
"Hitman" Wilson, via 102.7 WBMX. His mix tape collection fast became a 
fixture within his bedroom, constantly taping the shows, studying them. 
Some called it simulcasted education.

Soon after the house scene was all grown up, entered the acid house 
sound. Here Terry really found solace. It was that added flavor he was 
waiting for, something new, twisted, and forward. Now all the elements 
were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this 
was it, three different languages, disco, house, and techno. They could 
all translate the same message together or apart from one another. This 
is how Terry is like a translator. With his fluent style, these 
languages reflect his DJ.ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, 
which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This 
sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, 
Control, Funk.d, CHC, Aciiieeed and on his own imprint Catalyst 
Recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of 
DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Tyree Cooper, Halo Varga, Mazi, Dan Curtin, Bryan 
Zentz, Angel Alanis, & TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, 
Acid OG.s, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin Project on 
Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva.s former imprint Definitive which 
featured Terry.s track .Sidewinder. on the Chemical Brothers .Brother.s 
Gonna. Work It Out. Mix CD. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his 
records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely 
successful .Products Of Our Environment. EP on Catalyst which was 
featured on Pete Tong.s Essential Selection on BBC Radio 1 in the UK & 
"La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk" EP on Smile which was licensed to several 
top DJ mix compilations. (Terry Mullan & Halo Varga collaboration).

Terry.s DJ.ing, label, and trax have earned him a reputation that 
extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each 
genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass 
twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

B. RICH
(Palms Out Sounds, [Only registered and activated users can see links. 
], Party Like US, Household Management)
Pittsburgh, Pa

B. Rich (aka Barrett Richards) is one of America's welcome purveyors of 
bass-heavy house music. With nearly a decade of DJ and producing 
experience within a rave scene that has come and gone, he has positioned 
himself nicely into house music and dropped like a bomb. He was 
influenced at a young age by early hip hop and old school rave such as 
Moby and has crafted a unique sound that is becoming internationally 
recognized. His sets are known to fly all over the map, between electro 
house, bassline, baltimore breaks, old skool dance and dubstep all with 
a unifying element: huge low end frequencies. When behind the tables he 
shows the signs of an artist and performer who truly loves their work. 
Over the past year B. Rich has gained support from top artists such as 
Foamo, AC Slater, Klever, DJ Craze, the Trouble & Bass crew, Heavyfeet, 
Designer Drugs, and many other DJs worldwide. Many of his tracks have 
received repeat BBC Radio 1 plays by Kissy Sell Out and even support 
from the Black Eyed Peas. His recent EP on Palms Out Sounds, "Ain't Here 
To Party", has been making huge waves and getting loads of blog support 
from the tops such as Discodust, Iheartcomix, etc. He is becoming a much 
more sought-after remixer with impressive work already done for top 
labels such as Ministry of Sound, Seclusiasis, Palms Out Sounds, and 
Menu Music. His name has also become a regular chart topper on Beatport

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Tranz am
(1st Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
San Franscico///Hardcore
//powerinmusic.com, triatom, loveallstars, San Fransisco hardcore//

This guy enjoys rockin' all types of Hardcore, especially the Freeform 
beats, but behind the scenes he plays it all. Yep that's right from 
house to hardcore and every genre in between. He has ventured into it 
and it keeps him on his toes. His main background consists of Breaks, 
Hard House, NRG, & Trance. Before he got into spinning Hardcore in 2005, 
he was actually spinning a lot of deep funky house. Tranz Am is a strong 
believer in the people, together they can move mountains, whatever they 
desire. There is power in the people, and power in music! Tranz AM is 
here to bring you positive vibes and good times, to bring you just a 
little closer to the sun. So when you see him up there on the decks 
don't be bashful, just get on the floor and burn it up!

Ronstoppable

Baltimore//Breaks & Electro

Ron got started spinning breaks in 2001. He dove straight into Flordia 
breaks and then UK breaks caught his fancy. He is known to mix some 
funky electro house into his sets to help him burn up the dance floors. 
He is currently a resident at Shorty's in B.More (previously owned by 
the legendary Charles Feelgood), as well as Liberty in Philly. He has 
been bangin' it out in clubs all up and down the east coast. We are 
proud to bring his floor rumbling sounds to the Steel City!

sight to be seen. Don't miss out on this wild man!!

sounds. She has held a residency at the Firehouse Lounge in the strip as 
well as other clubs around the burgh. Don't miss out on her beautiful 
sounds this night!

CO2
Pittsburgh area//Techno sexiness
Technoir Audio

Chris began his djing experience in 1998 when he bought his first 
turntables. This is a man who loves microwaves and hates video games 
that cost more than 25 cents. His love of techno began when he realized 
that mainstream radio was crap and he was hunting for a sound that was 
"new" and "better". Techno was an obvious choice for him since he still 
needs to hunt for "that" sound. He will be here this night to deliver 
what he has found to you!

Sat Sep 26                      TERRY MULLAN                      Cleveland

Saturday, September 26, 2009
Anatomy Ultra Lounge
Cleveland, Ohio
1299 W. 9th St
Cleveland, OH
	
Terry Mullan's back again to drop some funky tunes for us heads! 
Featured on the rooftop patio of Anatomy with residents 7UP, Elysium & 
Evan Evolution!

Being a fan of music sometimes means nothing else matters. This is true 
to life for Chicago.s Terry Mullan. His ears were alert at the right 
time, if house music is your thing. Right smack in the middle of the 
blossoming house development of Chicago during the mid 80's, at an early 
age, Terry was already in tune with what was actually happening.

Although his roots began in hip-hop, Terry found himself smack in the 
middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of 
music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. 
Faithfully listening and recording the then burgeoning Chicago airwaves, 
his nights during middle school were filled with the finest in Chicago 
house. DJ's like Farley .Jackmaster. funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, & Mike 
"Hitman" Wilson, via 102.7 WBMX. His mix tape collection fast became a 
fixture within his bedroom, constantly taping the shows, studying them. 
Some called it simulcasted education.

Soon after the house scene was all grown up, entered the acid house 
sound. Here Terry really found solace. It was that added flavor he was 
waiting for, something new, twisted, and forward. Now all the elements 
were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this 
was it, three different languages, disco, house, and techno. They could 
all translate the same message together or apart from one another. This 
is how Terry is like a translator. With his fluent style, these 
languages reflect his DJ.ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, 
which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This 
sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, 
Control, Funk.d, CHC, Aciiieeed and on his own imprint Catalyst 
Recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of 
DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Tyree Cooper, Halo Varga, Mazi, Dan Curtin, Bryan 
Zentz, Angel Alanis, & TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, 
Acid OG.s, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin Project on 
Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva.s former imprint Definitive which 
featured Terry.s track .Sidewinder. on the Chemical Brothers .Brother.s 
Gonna. Work It Out. Mix CD. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his 
records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely 
successful .Products Of Our Environment. EP on Catalyst which was 
featured on Pete Tong.s Essential Selection on BBC Radio 1 in the UK & 
"La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk" EP on Smile which was licensed to several 
top DJ mix compilations. (Terry Mullan & Halo Varga collaboration).

Terry.s DJ.ing, label, and trax have earned him a reputation that 
extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each 
genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass 
twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

B.A.D. Ass. & Family invite you to touch down on the 4th planet.

Saturday October 3rd, 2009
Akron Ohio


B. RICH
(Palms Out Sounds, [Only registered and activated users can see links. 
], Party Like US, Household Management)
Pittsburgh, Pa

B. Rich (aka Barrett Richards) is one of America's welcome purveyors of 
bass-heavy house music. With nearly a decade of DJ and producing 
experience within a rave scene that has come and gone, he has positioned 
himself nicely into house music and dropped like a bomb. He was 
influenced at a young age by early hip hop and old school rave such as 
Moby and has crafted a unique sound that is becoming internationally 
recognized. His sets are known to fly all over the map, between electro 
house, bassline, baltimore breaks, old skool dance and dubstep all with 
a unifying element: huge low end frequencies. When behind the tables he 
shows the signs of an artist and performer who truly loves their work. 
Over the past year B. Rich has gained support from top artists such as 
Foamo, AC Slater, Klever, DJ Craze, the Trouble & Bass crew, Heavyfeet, 
Designer Drugs, and many other DJs worldwide. Many of his tracks have 
received repeat BBC Radio 1 plays by Kissy Sell Out and even support 
from the Black Eyed Peas. His recent EP on Palms Out Sounds, "Ain't Here 
To Party", has been making huge waves and getting loads of blog support 
from the tops such as Discodust, Iheartcomix, etc. He is becoming a much 
more sought-after remixer with impressive work already done for top 
labels such as Ministry of Sound, Seclusiasis, Palms Out Sounds, and 
Menu Music. His name has also become a regular chart topper on Beatport 
and other major download sites.


Hired Guns
(M.I.A, Sur America, Combat, New Ascension, B.A.D. Ass.)
Chicago IL / Akron OH

Alfonz De La Mota & MC Infinity make up this new combo set to blaze a 
fire in the dnb scene. Alfonz has been Djing for over 15 years and 
Infinity has been blazing dnb sets since the late 90's. These guys rep 
for one of Americas largest drum n bass collectives the "M.I.A." aka 
Murda In America DnB crew based in Chicago with over 25+ djs across the 
nation and are the embodiment of energy when they perform together. 
Separately they have rocked an impressive string of majorcites all over 
the states including New York, LA, Detroit, Indy, Cinci, Vegas and many 
others. When home in Chicago, Alfonz stays busy holding down the 
funktion sound system once a month at Chicago's legendary club ""Smart 
Bar" for "Big Bass Thursdays". Infinity is based in Ohio and has been 
headlining major events and raves all over at a hectic pace solidifying 
his reputation with every show. Fonz and Infinity both hit the stage 
with the same fervor and professionalism and are aiming to bring this 
electric vibe to a show near you.
