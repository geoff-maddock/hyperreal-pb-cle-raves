                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well (but isn't).

Submissions to: s0176326@cc.ysu.edu (preferred) or
                jffocht@cis.ysu.edu (i don't check this one often!)

sorry i've been neglecting my 'reviewing duties', but to
tell u the truth the last couple of partys all but added
to my depressed state - yup stevie t wuz going thru some
serious mid-life crisis. hmmm mebbe dats why there's 
been such a drop of multiple bandwidth wasting posts w/
that annoying 'PLRM' sig at the end of 'em.

but i'm sure y'all can give a shit less about what i've
been going thru, so i'll get to the reviewing...

GENERATOR PRE-PARTY - 4.26.96 - elaine's pad in columbus, oh
------------------------------------------------------------

welp i think i've been to elaine's place once after the
last ele mental thingy w/ the paul johnson no show. 
basically we were there for 15 minutes before we took 
off to liz's to take her on that seriously long & draining
trip to MARS in syracuse - but that's another story all
together.

i'm sorry but w/ the past couple of ele mental private 
thingy's i've been catching more of this...ugh it's that
kid from cleveland again...what's he doing here vibe...and
i caught this vibe more than ever at this party. i'm sorry
but i just felt very unwelcome at this party. it seemed as
if the ele mental / columbus community had cliqued itself
purdy tightly and any outsiders especially from cleveland
were foreigners and were there for evil purposes or some
thing. and this really pissed me off especially since i've
been supporting ele mental partys since Minimal State. and
that's a whole lotta partys especially for some one from
cleveland. 

this brings me to this REPRESENT, REPRESENT bull shit.
yah i'm from cleveland, but i sure as hell don't want to 
be thought of as a representative of cleveland. i mean
cleveland is a pretty damn big city w/ a whole lotta people
living in it. just becuz somebody from cleveland may be an
idiot some time, does not mean everybody from cleveland is 
an idiot. hell i'm also from california and i sure as hell 
don't represent california. and i'm also asian and i sure as 
hell don't represent all asians. i think chris put it best 
when i interviewed him and alex of spawntaneous in the last 
PLRM:

"everyone has to be judged as an individual & u have to judge
them continuously. u canUt pass judgement on Alex in 1989 & 
say heUs gonna be a good guy or a bad guy for the rest of his 
life. itUs all what is happening right now in this persons life 
& in his mind. and is he capable of being the person i want to
interact with my life."

and that's another thing i wanted to bring up this prejudice
against Spawntaneous. ok everyone knows about their dark side.
i for one may know it better than anyone on this list minus
steve from centrak since i wuz there since they 1st started 
out here in cleveland - hell i used to pull alex on to my 
college radio show when he was still in high school and when
they 1st started doing their old church after hours, i wuz
there that 1st night. damn my 'stevie t' eight ball logo wuz
one of the 1st tags in that place. but here's the thing until 
you've lived in that world, then u have no clue about what u're 
talking about. believe u me i don't think most people know just
how deep this world runs. it's got a much bigger grip of things
than many may realize. and just becuz they do what they do, duz 
it make them any less human than u or i? everyone has feelings. 
some just hide them better.

and until u've hung out w/ some one for a good period of time,
then u have no right to judge them. and some one else's opinions
may not necessarily apply to u. becuz not everybody treats
everyone the same way. i myself will not believe any shit talk
against some one else until that certain someone has personally 
wronged me. i've heard enuff 90210 high school shit talk to
know how wack it is. usually it boils down to simple jealousy.
and the way a person acts at partys may be completely different
than the way they act in real life. plus everybody has their
bad days. and everybody can't be all plury all the friggin time.
lots of things can play in effect: PMS, finals coming up, a 
recent break-up, oweing people money, lack of sleep, lack of
money, etc. etc. 
 
sorry but i really had to get all this off my chest.

ugh, damn there i go again...going off about stuff that has 
nothing to do with the party itself...but it is the stuff that
everybody thinks about, but doesn't want to talk about...the stuff
we learn about life from going to partys...the stuff they don't
teach u @ school...the stuff u can only learn thru experience
(well somebody's gotta do it since there are too many techno 
geeks on here that only wanna talk about the music!)

speakin o experiences, another freaky experience happened at the
party: elaine's microwave exploded. alot of freaky things that can
not be controlled have been occuring lately around me to remind me
that yes there are forces that can not be explained by science
alone. like all those freaky occurences before 420: all those
tornados (some of the kids i talked to coming from the west, almost
didn't make it), chris pulse almost killing himself right before the
party due to wack psychedelics, lisa lee from new york (prolly the
most influential girl dancer to me) almost died when her heart
stopped the night before 420 also due to wack psychedelics, jinx's
mom got so sick in the stomach she had to be taken to the hospital
the weekend of 420. it seemed that some one wuz definitely trying to
make his presence known the weekend of 420 - that's for sure. either
that or some people have been trying really hard to freak me out
by telling me all these wack stories. well now u know part of the
reasons why i wuz so depressed the last couple of weeks.

ok enuff about that freaky stuff, here's some pluses about the party:

+ doug giving me & gank (yah i brought one of those evil  
  spawntaneous dj's with me hoping to break some barriers - silly
  me) tix for Generator at a much appreciated $10 discounted price.

+ filtered running H2O (a rarity at most ele mental house partys) 

+ blender's set - i wuz too impressed w/ a girl who had just
  started spinning a year ago to notice any mistakes - the next
  generation is looking good. and she's got her spanking new
  hi-tech headset to boot!

+ divine -  who started spinning some old skool hip hop and 
  then jungle. some how got me dancing to two styles of music that i    
  don't usually care for. i wuz so proud that i had to get ed to
  tell him: yes i finally understand it. 

+ lunar's set - i can not describe ed's style of mixin. i know
  he wuz spinnin jungle. but the way he did it - a very comedic
  GAGAfied style - sorta like titonton on acid or something (which
  is kinda impossible since both ed & tintonton are straight).
  except taller & whiter & minus the dreads. atleast he cleared
  the floor enuff so i had enuff space to finally really throw
  down =)

+ seeing christa again, who i spent my weekend with - the true
  light in the shade of my morning sun & the real reason i trekked
  down to columbus (i wuz plannin on retirin, but alas some one
  special always pulls me back in). it's amazing how one person can
  completely bring you back up. and believe u me it wuz a very
  deep dark depressing hole i wuz stuck in. the most amazing part
  wuz that we had the best time outside of the partys: at her
  place, at the park, at a supermarket of all places - boy have
  i been missing out. i've been doing this party thing so long
  that i've almost forgotten about the little things in life that
  can really bring about a true vibe. this is definetly something
  i'm gonna hafta explore some more.

---

GENERATOR - ele mental & illuminators - 4.27.96 - columbus, ohio 
----------------------------------------------------------------

welp christa & i missed out on the IGNITION pre-party becuz...well
we were busy uhm doing things. plus we had to wait for her friends
from detroit: rick and i think her name wuz lisa - mike huckaby's
girlfriend. 

it wuz fun waitin in the guest list line listenin to lisa going off
about 'her competition'. but it wuz more fun gettin in and listenin
to her man...

MIKE HUCKABY - geeze louise and i thought his set wuz good @ CHERRY.
i really think they should've switched mike w/ ESP, but nevertheless
his set rocked so hard and really got kids on the floor when usually
the 1st dj doesn't get that much draw. detroit selection wuz
defintely the key here. 

ESP WOODY MCBRIDE - i dunno what it wuz, but woody's set just didn't
do too much for me. i alwaze thought woody wuz a better producer
than dj anywaze. but this may have been becuz it wuz during his set
that i did most of my socializin.

DAVE CLARKE - omigaaaaawd! dis boys got skills skills skills! me &
the troutman were standing there with our jaws on the ground as the
man who wasn't behind the wheel (No Ones Driving 1996 world tour)
spun in & out of records all within a minute or less. it was amusing
seeing that record crate o records he had on the table beside him
get more and more disorganized from his rapid fire selections. proof
positive that u don't have to be black and from detroit to have any
skillz - yup reverse racism still exists in our scene (stevie t,
tired of being reminded he's not black every time he steps in a
circle (which wuz what ruined my trip to MARS - atleast Forrest, the
leader of the RSC pack @ Mars, gave respects)). i won't even mention
the racism against italians i noticed up in the toronto scene.

T-1000 - chatted w/ mr. oldham a li'l by sean's get smart bar. took
him awhile to remember me from T2. but when he remembered, he wasted
no time sticking a 'Generator' sticker on me. i wish i had brought 
enuff money to get his new CD, cuz if it's any good as his set wuz
@ the party, oooh nelly! hard thumpin pure techno that got my booty
movin (a rarity these daze). even more impressive wuz how alan 
catered to the crowd - even gave'em a chance to catch their breath
& take a li'l breather. and just when he knew u were well rested 
enuff, he'd drop the beats & force the dance outta yah again.

TERRY MULLAN - as usual terry's consistent skillz and uncanny 
musical selection of house dipped in his special flava of acid
tweaked the kids out in the best way possible - strictly thru 
the musik. and when he spun that "Let Me Show U Love" track 
that Mystic Bill spun @ IO2 - it wuz all over! he had just about
every kid throwin down on the dance floor. this track wuz pretty
meaningful for me too, cuz it wuz someone that showed me love
that brought me outta my deep dark depressed hole. 

Crysta had to work that same morning so we missed out on Steve
aka Sleepy C's set, but i'm sure he delivered the goods as usual.

other stuff besides the musik within the Generator:

THE SPACE 

i love this space - defintely brought back memories from ONE. super
high ceilings. smooth dance floor. clean bath rooms. plus u get to
ride all those neato escalators on the way up. i hope it's not a
rumor that all the ohio crews will be coming together to throw a
huge new year's eve party at this space. cuz this space is defintely
the place to do it. that truly would be the big ONE.

THE LASERS

Jamie, Matt & the whole Love Light Laser crew really out did 
themselves this time. the laser shooting from behind the dj area
thru the mesh across the room to the far wall. creating mural sized 
moving geometric images, a spinning globe, dancers dancing together. 
definitely one of the best laser shows i've ever seen.

THE LIGHTS

as usual Chip & the whole Eyegasm crew illuminated the space in
their specialized creative fashion. red, white, and blue strobes
some times blinding you in the face. intellibeams moving to the
beat on both sides. all of it enhanced the psychedelic technolized 
musical journey within the Generator.

THE SOUND 

as described before Thundersounds walls of evmt4's really shook
the walls in the main room. not quite as loud as Frenche's system,
but it definitely wuz sufficient in delivering the proper sounds.
i won't get into it too much cuz i'm not a basshead.

THE PEOPLE & THE VIBE

alas the stuff i like most at partys. so many familiar faces that
kept me smiling at the party i just gotta give props: mary, shannon,
leidra, breaker dan & his dance crew, trevor lamont - i still 
haven't seen yur baby yet, jeff/stuff, his mary, chris, big aron,
mark, joe, omigawd kate wuz @ the party!, lady ms. lisa, drew, tom,
gabe, his girl & the whole cleveland crew, even super k wuz there,
sandy soon to be officially mrs. C, jakov w/ his girl helpin him
work on his attitude, just ray beein' just ray, crystal - sorry
about mesmerism but some times there are things you just can't 
control - it's called fate, josh so into the dance that he didn't
notice me for the longest time, gank who i brought to columbus - i
still have yur stuff in my car, ed luna, titonton, doughboy, tony
ramos, kevin kennedy & the whole ele mental crew, miyung, paul, 
anthony the tall spinning dancing machine - U the Man! becky, dawn,
elaine, michael, liz, jason & the idiot boy crew, ack! i better quit
before i get flamed for wasting bandwidth again! so many people that
have been a part of the happiest daze of my life. my family away
from my family. all the people that i have come in contact with and
have had a positive influence in my blurry life & hopefully i've had
some positive influence toward them. the family of light. 

peace & love to the family of light & keep the faith...

pee.ass - after the party. when we woke up, christa & i had to
return to the space for my car keys. damn Jnco khaki pockets
make yah lose everything! but luckily security found them. i
guess i've got some guardian angels lookin out for me.

columbus truly is the heart of it all.

i dunno if tony RAMos planned on posting this but here goes:

get to columbus ohio...(har har)

then find I 71 and get off at the 11th ave exit (exit 110B i think), then
go WEST from there towards high st...follow 11th about 1 mile to GRANT st
(that's the 1st light).  take a quick RIGHT then a quick LEFT onto
CHITTENDEN.  stay west on chittenden for about 3 lights till it dead ends
into HIGH ST.  take a LEFT on high st, down to the corner of 9th ave and
high st.  look for 1495 n high st, the same buliding as a pager place with 
lots o neon shit... 

looks like we'll be starting around midnight so come on by!  and bring a 
friend...it's only $3.

Hello!

I was just wondering if anyone is going to Protoculture tonight.  It was 
on the latest ROM but when I called the info line it was disconnected.  I 
haven't seen anything that says where it is going to be, if it is still 
happening tonight.  Any information would be helpful.

finally, a party that seemed more fueled by vibe than by drugs.  i felt 
for once that an event was more a social occasion than a drugfest...with 
people really seeming to be interested in the music, and just hanging 
out, like the "old days"...before the shadiness, before the shit which is 
bringing the scene down.

i dont mean to idealize but this was an old-skool event: cheap, with 
not-so-perfect sound, good music, and people having fun.  tony ramos gets 
mad props for getting it together and pulling of a nice little event.

im still recovering from it so i want say too much (why do i always write 
reviews as im half asleep so i cant remember what i wrote?)...but here goes.

the space was a really small place called virtual overdrive, where there 
are doom games and a couple other interactive and 3-d video games.  tony 
set up some amazing visuals he did himself with video feedback and other 
live sources, and he played a tape of this stuff on monitors all over the 
walls and above the crowd. 

the system lacked sufficient kick, tho...last minute shit prevented a 
proper sound system from being imported.  i think this was a blessing in 
disguise, as it allowed people more room to talk without having to yell.  

i also met a LOT of new kids...a bunch of girls who were at the event like
2 hrs before it started and stayed till the very end.  people i love
having at our events...they seemed really cheerful, helpful, and pretty much 
drug-free, and no attitude.  sadly i bet they'll lose this as they get 
more involved in the scene but i hope by seeing us, they'll realize that 
you can be a bit geeky and still be cool ;)

oh well, enough cruading (i never seem to stop, eh?), let's get to the music.

chris jones as gleek is improving as a dj, we just gotta drag him out 
more and drag him up to detroit to get some mo rekkids ;)

placebo was awesome, nice to see him tear up outside of the rather more 
conservative atmosphere of mekka, where he's gotta play shit to make ppl 
dance as opposed to playing shit he wants to play...

titonton was awesome as well...a little smoother this time, but with some 
great conceptual mixes which i so appreciate.

dan curtin was on next, and man he did not disappoint!  at one point 
there was a breakdance circle which distracted from the music (altho it 
was cool too), but other than that the music really pumped.  a weird 
mixture of old-skool flavored chicago-style trax and some experimental 
stuff, hard to explain.  nice to see ms. cat as well (aka sista spinsta).
i dunno if i should say this publicly but dan basically did this event 
for almost nothing, because i think he sees what we are trying to do and 
supports us.  i mean, the man can command a $1000 fee in europe so he's 
not potatoes...but i think dan shows us how much he cares about the 
midwest (especially when it involves his own artist titonton ;), in 
coming over to our low-budget assed way of doing things.  there's nothing 
more encouraging to us than to have people like dan curtin work with us 
on something like this...

and shake was no different.  his set was really fun mixes between old 
chicago trax records and newer stuff, then old electro, etc...but it was 
marred by some sound problems (such is, eh?).  anyway, shake also 
graciously spun for very little, which we really appreciated, and he 
seemed really happy to get some props (which is hard to get in detroit, 
especially from the "rave" scene).  i told him that i see him as part of 
ele mental in a way...at least in the way that he operates.  he has his 
own label and is working hard as hell to get some music out, to get his 
name out, to try to make a little cash to get by on...just like a lot of 
people in detroit are still doing and will probably continue to do...out 
of necessity.  it's an inspiration for us to have him in columbus.

monochrome/charles ended the night in the unenviable position of having to
start with only one speaker working, but by the end of his electro/hip hop
set he had the place jumping again!  i was very surprised.  it was nice to
see c let loose with the kind of music which seems very influential to him
in his own "techno voyage" or whatever cheesy word you choose to use... 

so that was it.  

there was a lot of strange goings-on in columbus due to the SYNESTHESIA 
event from dayton being moved to columbus at the last minute, but i hope 
no one thinks for a minute that we intended those guys any harm, we 
simply couldnt do them much good being that our space was very small.  so 
i do regret their current situation, and i hope they can recover from 
these losses...

ok i cant type anymoire my eyes are gkluing shut....

glad to see everyone who came out last night, even that stevie guy from 
cleveland who we dont like to have around ;^)

ok, we're doing 3LE MENTAL, which will be a very special event that means 
a lot to me and our cru, it's kinda our corny version of a 3rd year 
anniversary.  we been doing stuff since early `93 but ELE MENTAL was our 
first real party in may of `93, and so this is the 3rd year we've been 
kicking it, so why not celebrate where we've been and where we're going...

anyway, if you want a pre-flyer (the real flyer'll be out soon) please 
email me and i will send you some.  please specify about how many you feel 
you need, and if i run out i can get you some of the final ones which 
will be out this weekend.

i know some of you support us, even from afar, and have read what shit i
have written, or the music of todd sines, titonton, charles/monochrome, or
any number of the cru who have spun out or played live at events all
over...so now's your chance to become a part of it as well.  get the word
out on us and what we represent.  even though we are in columbus and maybe
you cant come support us yourself, just let people know we exist and show
them the webpages, etc, and maybe some of those people that like what we
are all about will come to us and see it for themselves. 

and if you havent figured out what we represent by now, i guess i have a
lot o work left to do, huh?  *sags*

[hint hint: it's about doing shit for ourselves (or yourselves)...art...
music...technology...friendship...honesty...you know, all that b.s.]

If you don't take the risk you'll never do it. It's a party for god's 
sakes it for the benefit of the people and if you come close or break 
even, more power to ya. They'll never call you a 'Screw Up' if you don't 
try.

ed sed:
=================================================================
the space was a really small place called virtual overdrive, where there 
are doom games and a couple other interactive and 3-d video games.  tony
set up some amazing visuals he did himself with video feedback and other 
live sources, and he played a tape of this stuff on monitors all over the 
walls and above the crowd.
=================================================================

the multiple tv screens w/ everything from japanimation to 
godzilla vs. rodan did not go unnoticed. much props to tony 
for adding his special flava of visuals and for putting this
party together 

=================================================================
the system lacked sufficient kick, tho...last minute shit prevented a 
proper sound system from being imported.  i think this was a blessing in 
disguise, as it allowed people more room to talk without having to yell.
=================================================================

actually i thought this wuz a bonus also. eventho it's still
difficult for me to meet new people, i still like to hear what
they're saying. i think this is one aspect of the party scene
that is making a much deserved come back - actually getting
to know the people u are partying with. it def makes things
a li'l more real.

==================================================================
i also met a LOT of new kids...a bunch of girls who were at the event like
2 hrs before it started and stayed till the very end.  people i love
having at our events...they seemed really cheerful, helpful, and pretty much 
drug-free, and no attitude.  sadly i bet they'll lose this as they get 
more involved in the scene but i hope by seeing us, they'll realize that 
you can be a bit geeky and still be cool ;)
==================================================================  

hmm were these grrrls by chance from dayton. i met one who
originally gave me that "ill...it's dat evil kid from cleveland
again look", but she turned out to be purdy nice. the ironic
part wuz my friend thought she looked like a female version  
of gank & had similar dance moves as myself. she really got
the vibe going from dancing so much up front tho.

==================================================================  
dan curtin was on next, and man he did not disappoint!  at one point 
there was a breakdance circle which distracted from the music (altho it 
was cool too), but other than that the music really pumped.  a weird 
mixture of old-skool flavored chicago-style trax and some experimental 
stuff, hard to explain.  nice to see ms. cat as well (aka sista spinsta).
i dunno if i should say this publicly but dan basically did this event 
for almost nothing, because i think he sees what we are trying to do and 
supports us.  i mean, the man can command a $1000 fee in europe so he's 
not potatoes...but i think dan shows us how much he cares about the 
midwest (especially when it involves his own artist titonton ;), in 
coming over to our low-budget assed way of doing things.  there's nothing 
more encouraging to us than to have people like dan curtin work with us 
on something like this...
=====================================================================

i also wanna point out that dan is also doing this thursday night 
thingy here in cleveland at the brillo pad where he's been hosting
dj's from detroit and other cities. last week dbx dan bell spun.
so if yur in town on a thursday night, i suggest y'all check it out.

yah i wuz kinda surprised of seeing cat as well since she's been
getting mad bookings on the east coast. hopefully she'll get booked
more often here so we can see more of her here. this way other up
& coming female dj's can have some one to look up to.

i personally thought the break circle wuz the highlight of the       
party especially when ed jumped in & did his ele-honkey grooves!
only to be topped by powerhouse w/ his 250lb jello shake - watch
it wiggle! watch it jiggle! =) of course that stevie guy couldn't
jump in - he's not black! actually it's cuz he's 26 & losing it

====================================================================== 
there was a lot of strange goings-on in columbus due to the SYNESTHESIA 
event from dayton being moved to columbus at the last minute, but i hope 
no one thinks for a minute that we intended those guys any harm, we 
simply couldnt do them much good being that our space was very small.  so 
i do regret their current situation, and i hope they can recover from 
these losses...
======================================================================= 

i did find it a bit odd when jimbob showed up at the party & he wuz
s'posed to be spinning at Synesthesia. it's too bad too cuz DJ Liquid
just sent me he & shilo magi's mixed tape & he is very good - def one
of the better san fran dj's. personally i think their flyer killed 
them. but i wuz surprised they got the valleydale when the owners of
the space vowed never again to have a party there after the damaging
effects of the sound system after Biosphere - now that wuz a party to
remember!

========================================================================
glad to see everyone who came out last night, even that stevie guy from 
cleveland who we dont like to have around ;^)
++
e d
========================================================================

tee hee u may be seeing me a whole lot more since i should be moving 
down to columbus some time soon since i'll be finishing up school there
since mom decided case wuz too expensive after two graduating sisters.

on may 21, 1993
a modest event took place in columbus...called ELE_MENTAL,
thrown by members of the techno band BODY RELEASE and their
many friends.

from the beginning, we sought to make the most from basic
elements...bringing art, music, technology, friendship, and
knowledge together into one word: "ele mental" (split in
two to stress the mental part of our mission).

join us as we celebrate what has been and what will be,
recapturing the spirit of our first event with most of the
people who have been here from the beginning, plus some new
ones who have come along since...an event completed by the
presence of those of you who have been listening.

this event is for all of us...

tentative order of appearance:

gleek (m christopher jones) minimal traxx

i/d (ian davis) detroit traxx

todd sines  minimal traxx, electro

	this is my post to the ne-raves list concerning the upcoming SOUR

					-- rick worth

> And why not?

	i think a better statement for rick to have made would be "i can't
	believe who is throwing this party".  i am going to bite my tongue
	on a bit of this issue, but i am sure the junglists in the pittbsurgh
	scene know how fucked up the promotion situation is with this one.

	the sunshine kids have taken the reins and offered their time, 
	investor's money and name to the pittsburgh portion of the SOUR
	tour.  most kids are wondering why a promotion company like UDG,
	known for big-upping jungle for over a year and a half running,
	aren't involved in this one.  as a matter of fact, john and ryan
	(UDG) are wondering the same thing.  apparently there was some sort
	of mixup about who was going to be in charge of promoting this
	event, and control was eventually given to the sunshine kids as
	a "last resort" (quote) since they were purportedly the only
	people with the money to throw it (a point which is contested by
	other promoters in the scene that say they also had the means to
	pull it off...yet weren't asked).
	
	so what's the big deal?

	i have spoken with a few people who say that hey! at least pittsburgh
	is going to host the SOUR tour and give the kids in pittsburgh a chance
	to hear some good jungle.  i would agree, this is going to be the
	case.  the lineup is rather large and i am friends with most of the djs
	who will be in attendance.  the problem with this situation is that
	the party is being thrown by a promotion company not really involved
	at all with the jungle scene, a promotion company that has been known
	to casually make dergatory remarks about the jungle scene, and who
	have very little if no love for the music or junglists for that
	matter.  it is true that their parties have featured one jungle dj
	per event.  but ask starchild what time he performed at 'super
	fresh' (opening slot) or ask tik-tak what time he will be performing
	at the upcoming 'superfly' (10pm is the report i have heard).  yet
	here we have the same promoters involving themselves in an all jungle
	production.  are they doing it for the love of music?  for the jungle
	scene?  who knows, but i believe the real reasons to be highly
	suspect.  

	ask yourself if you would you support a rave thrown by non-ravers.

	then ask yourself if you would support a jungle party thrown by
	non-junglists.

	the reason i am saying this is because i have been involved with
	breaks since late 91 / early 92.  i love the music.  i have been
	involved with the pittsburgh 'jungle scene' since day one.  when i
	hear the scene and music dissed by certain people who then turn
	around and embrace it, it bothers me.  there are a few people 
	i know that don't take it as personally as i do.  they want to
	see a good party happen, regardless of the forces behind it.  chris
	starchild says that he won't attend/support a party without one good
	jungle dj.  i won't support a jungle party thrown by people who 
	pretend to be into jungle (when it looks good for them politically and
	financially).  yes, people change.  let's look to jungle warfare a
	few months back...if the sunshine kids were there, they certainly
	weren't the most enthusiastic of the lot.

	in response to those who have asked me and to basically set the
	record straight, i was not approached to spin because of political
	reasons that i won't go into.  if you ask the sunshine kids, they
	might tell you that, or they might tell you that i suck and i
	play way too hard (regardless of the fact that my records do not
	differ too much from sine, starchild, tik-tak *or* karl k).  in any
	case, i wouldn't have played even if asked.  i support the talent 
	behind the party...they are what is going to make it happen.  as far
	as what is going on behind-the-scenes, i find the situation ridiculous, 
	as do others in the scene who aren't getting paid to support it.

hi all,
i'm relatively new to the rave scene (and to this bboard).. but i wanted
to ask for help and opinions. i'm going to start training at WRCT
(pittsburgh) and hopefully will have my own show by july.. anyway, i'm
really into ambient and jungle (not as much into techno/house), and
wanted to include that in my show. but... i'm not too familiar with
names of great djs that are on vinyl (or cd).. so if anyone has any
suggestions, any names, any locations in pgh where i could buy the stuff
(from what i've heard the shop in the strip bar is gone), please let me
know! 
                                thanks in advance..................amie

Hey, good for you.  Congratulations and good luck. :)

Where do you pick up an RCT summer schedule?  And are there any RCT 
jungle/trip hop/hip hop DJs here who would let me come in a peak around 
during their show?  
I'm a dj at PTS and we just got a pair of 12s and they're looking into 
getting a crossfader.  I'd like to see how things are done at RCT and how 
different it is from out here in Indie Land.

Also, would anyone out there who spins the stuff I just mentioned or makes 
any kind of electronic dance music, be willing to let me come over and 
watch you practice or help listen to records and be 
quiet as a mouse and watch attentively and maybe ask some questions?

More specifically, what are the differences b/t certain styles, 
esp the subdivisions of jungle?  etc etc etc I have lots and lots of 
questions.  I'm curious, respectful, careful, quiet, musical, and I have 
a critical ear...I just don't always know what I'm listening to. :)

My goal this summer is to buy some records in all kinds of styles but I'm 
not sure where to start.  Anyway, responses would be appreciated!!!!  :) 
:) :)

Thanks a lot!  Love, steph, quiet as a mouse.

Anyone going to this Philly party on the 18th?  As in, anyone wanna give 
me a ride back?  Gas, tolls, and mom's cookin' in return...

If you plan to get there the 17th that's even better.  In fact, anyone 
wanting to make this road trip, you can go to my friend's b-day party on 
the 17th and 
stay at my parents' house in lovely Chester County for a night or 2.  My 
mother will feed you, my sisters are funny, and you can hear crickets out 
there.  We'll get pizza at Fourth and South and go to 611 records. 

Wow, I really need to go home. :)  Please respond.

Please forgive me if I sound a little hostile, b/c this is good 
information and everything, but it's not a secret!!!  It's printed on the 
flier!!!  This is a bitter point with me, this whole concept of keeping 
things "secret" that are wide out in the open.  Some promoters seem to do 
it more than others....but I'm biased.  Alright, I'll stop before I 
descend into a mucky pit of shit-talking.

     excuse me once again....but there is a big difference between being a 
    supporter, open-minded, and an elitism...  
    
    being elitist=narrowmindedness...
    being supportive=supporting something you love, be it raves in general, 
    or a type of music...but it also means taking in other forms and 
    accepting them for what they are- not only to you, but to others...
    
    and being open-minded=being open to different things and not forming 
    opinions on things you aren't educated in...and not whining when its 
    really not necessary, nor does it justify your "opinions"....
    
    i'm really sorry if this sounds bitchy...but i'm tired of hearing "i hate 
    jungle i hate jungle" from ppl, when (correct me if i'm wrong) i RARELY 
    hear a junglist say "i hate house i hate house"....  i dunno...i'm 
    supportive of all scenes and all forms of music (from country to acid 
    house to jungle)...so i guess my point comes to this:  no one likes to 
    hear someone bitch, so if you complain about the same thing more than 
    twice in the same day, thats one time too many...so shaddup and make the 
    fucking best of it! ;)
    
    love,
    piper....jungle/deephouse deevah  <--my secret's out ;O

went to work last night & caught this inspiring piece off of one
of my co-workers desk. it moved me so much, i copied it down...

IMAGINE

can you imagine
a world, in which
every last human
is selfish and rich?
where horror and greed
and laziness thrive
where jealousy - hatred
are always alive
where love has been lost
and honor has died
and no tears are wept
since they all have been cried
where brother fights brother
and father kills son
and anything, everything evil
is done
where hope has been smashed
and the women all scream
since their husbands are dead
and their children can't dream
where money comes first
and morals comes last
where wrong is the right
and rights in the past
don't give up hope
this might not come true
our future depends
on me and on...You

Hey amie,

	There are plenty of good DJs at WRCT that can help you with the
music for your upcoming show.  Ask Ed Bucholtz about Ambient and Jungle,
he's on this list too, so maybe he'll reply to you later (Hi Ed).  I
think that Chris (Starchild) is on WRCT, he's a Junglist.  So is Pavlo. 
The Techno Terrorists sometimes play Jungle towards the end of their sets. 
As far as Record stores go, you can mail order off of records stores on
the internet, that's the easiest way to get specific tunes you're looking
for.  Do a Web Search for "Resonence" and "Nutty" records, they're the two
biggest online stores who supply Jungle.  Locally you can check Future
Sound in Forest Hills.  Or the record shop you mentioned that used to be
under the Strip Bar, (Good Vibes) is now on Atwood St. in Oakland.
Although every time I go by there it's closed, at 1pm in the afternoon !? 

anyways, good luck with it...

The WRCT summer schedule is available on their Web site at

Any day now ... I have definite 1200 envy or WRCT, they have Three or 
Four PAIRS of 1200's and mixers!  It will be nice if our new 'PTS

Not much!  They just have a stronger signal, although I hear they have to 
pay for it by being extra nice to the FCC :-)

Anytime you want to stop by my show, feel free to drop in.  FirstClass 
spins it all, from the dancehall to the drum and the bass.

Are you serious?  All that stuff?  Is it all bolted down?  I hear the 
crossfader is *supposed* to be coming soon, but it's not a high 
priority.  

But to make this relevant to the whole list, if you go to Pitt, look into 
working at the station.  You don't have to be Scott Henry to spin up 
there (I don't have a clue and I've been up there for 3 years) and there 
is a definitely low population of dance-type djs.  Mail me for details, 
and btw, it looks like there are some openings on the summer schedule still.

Ok, here goes... I expect that in the next issue of URB magazine there
will appear a column by me in the "Massive" section of said
publication.  In that article I said lots and lots of good things
about Pittsburgh.  I wrote the article about 3 months ago.  In those
two months A LOT has changed for me, and my recent posts regarding the
Pittsburgh scene may seem to be hypocrtical in light of what I said in
the URB article.  Please, understand that I have an opinion and that
opinion can change over time.  I love Pittsburgh as a city.  I did
have a pretty decent raving winter. I did not mean to embellish things
in the URB article, but now since my opinion has changed it may seem
like I was lying or something.  I wasn't :) Opinions change just
remember that.  Also, until I have a lot of good things to say about
our scene I wont be writing any more for URB.  I could lie and say
things are all peachy keen hunky dory but I wont. :) Ok, thats all,
just make sure you check out the article :) -Count Zer0

I forwarded this (kinda by request) from Ryu/Iowotflaichi/super spy dude

READ IT :) 

it all started with me asking...

(editor's note : ** denotes my commentary original and added)

**> cya soon?
 
i don't know anymore....
this is going to be my last summer here in pittsburgh...i'm moving away in
the fall for school....things just don't look good as far as raving is
concerned anymore.  i hate being negative, but i just ain't feeling
what i should at a rave.  i know it might be just me, but things have
gotten way outta hand, to quote mix race.

90% of the music i listen to anymore came out before 1994...
i would die if someone actually played an old skool set one night.  that's what
i fell in love with, and that feeling is what i crave.  the sounds i here
anymore just sound like a bunch of yuppies in nice clothes trying too
hard to be different.
[i'm gonna whine here a bit and you are my shoulder to cry on now...i'm sorry,
but there ain't no one else at the moment.....]
        i grew up on jungle.  that is what formulated who i am today.
the first time i heard something like the prodigy's "jericho" i just melted in
the awe.  i was like "my god this is absolutly the most fullfilling sound i 
ever heard."  and i heard "firestarter" the other day and just wanted
to find mr howlett and shake him while saying, "what the hades has
gone wrong with you!" i'd explain what first got me into techno, but
it's quite an odd story, and a long one at that...so i shall refrain.
but let me just say that all my dreams
of what i thought music should be like was fullfilled when i first
heard techno.
everything made sense then, and all i knew is that "i wanted to make that
sound".  oh, this was in like 1992.  i didn't know a single person who even 
knew what techno was.  i lived in the country and went to a heavy metal/hip hop
school of jocks, pom poms, and band people.  i was alone in my love for this 
art.  i raved myselt....where?  in the woods, in my car, at work....
anywhere i could get my hands on a pair of headphones...i was in ecstacy.
and the best thing was that each cd i bought introduced me to something new
and BETTER!  i just got caught up in the whole thing.  and i had never been to 
a rave before.  i knew exactly what went on because i felt the music,
but i knew no one that went to raves, and i didn't even know how to
find them because i lived outside the city.
          well, this went on until my freshman year in college (1994 or so).
i there met this dutch girl who knew ravers and got me sorted.  she took me
to my first rave, and i was simply awestruck at what i saw...
people sitting, chit chatting, neo hippy bs, barren dance floors, strung out
abusers....
i guess i just built up this perfect dream of raving for 2 or 3 years, and the 
slow decline in the vibe was a bit of a shocker for me....
but i became accustomed to it.  i became extremely attached to it even though
it wasn't exactly what i expected.  i loved the feelings i felt when i heard 
diesel boy for the first time....but then i noticed something....
          i was hearing the same stuff at every rave.  the newness and 
progression that i was hearing in them compilations i was buying was not being 
played at the raves.  it seemed there was a formula that had to be used or
something.
jungle turned into something aweful.  a great wave of moodiness swept into the 
style, and corrupted it with gangster violence, hip hop degeneration, and poor 
attempts to make it the "next big thing".  this hurt me because jungle is what
i loved so much.  it sounded nothing like what it used to.  then i discovered 
happy hardcore.  hh was EXACTLY like the old skool.  it made me feel the same.
it brought back memories.  it made me laugh, cry, and sing all at once.....
but where was it?  not at pittsburgh that's for sure.  when i'd go to a pitt
rave i'd hear house (at 120 bpms), jungle (at 160 bpms), or acid/light
trance (at 130). that was the formula and it was exploited.
techno became a word seldom spoken because it wasn't a catch phrase anymore.
i felt like if i said techno, people would be like, "what a square."
          i guess i'm rambling a bit here, but the point is that what is going
on in pittsburgh now (hardly anything) is a far cry from being a rave scene.
two parties a month (if we are lucky) and some cliquey coffee house 
nonsense is a waste of my money, time, and energy.
i lost the desire to drive an hour and a half to hear the same crap i
heard last week.  the styles that i like aren't played.  

** editor's note... I deleted some remarks about specific Pittsburgh
dj's here, to try to avoid flame wars...**

yeah, i'll diss **some dj's** because it is their type of attitude
laiden music that i despise and want no part of.
             somethings got to change.  somethings gotta give me them original
feelings i had.  i don't think i'll ever have them again, but i gotta feel
something
good to make me shell out my hard earned cash.  guys like you should be
commended
for doing all that you do.  it's a shame that a bus trip has to be held to
get people
to a real rave 8 HOURS AWAY!  we shouldn't have to travel like that to
have fun!


** I TOTALLY AGREE. :) **

             now, my question/offer to you is this:  what does it take to throw
a rave.  not a party, but a rave [the word "rave" seemed to disappear with
"techno"].
i have no money at all, but will be willing to try and make some investments
or loans
or whatever.  nobody here knows me.  i only know like 3 pitt ravers, so that may
be a problem.  i want to try and salvige what i can from the scene, but
nobody's 
left any scraps to sort through, so i got to go and find my own trash.
would you be willing to try something like that?
         

if you are at all interested in hearing any of my stuff, i'll send you a tape
for free.  i'm sure you won't like it though.

** What a silly thing to say! I would love to hear your stuff Ryu! :) **

ok Pittsburgh... eat that :) Ryu is the man! :) Yay for Ryu!!! :) :)

That opener kind of frames the whole thing now, doesn't it?  The music
from '94 may have started it all for a lot of us, but why does that mean
that things have to stagnate at that style?  I still listen to my Omni
Trio "Renegade Snares" or Shy FX "Original Nutter" etc., etc., but does
that mean that new sounds can't be appreciated?  It seems like a lot of
the complaints on this list are from ravers who don't like Hip-Hop, or
songs with Hip-Hop samples, or Gangster lyrics, or whatever. Well, hold
tight 'cause the new releases in Jungle are swaying away from that and 
you should be able to find less "threatening" tunes.

Well, the prodigy don't make Jungle tracks anymore, so that's that.  
Besides, there are 'nuff new artists to fill their place with new sounds.

Sounds like you had a fantastical image of what a Rave would be.  It's 
not hard to see why the real thing couldn't measure up to a fantasy, no 
matter where your first rave was.

HardStep is only one subtype of Jungle.  Not all tracks are Hip-Hop 
ripoffs.  Keep an eye out for T-Power, Goldie, J. Majick, anything on 
Moving Shadow, Viveen Wray, Precious Materials, or many others.  There's 
plenty of new tracks that will fit your tastes, you just have to look.  

> hh was EXACTLY like the old skool.  it made me feel the same.

Not much HH in Pittsburgh, let's just say it doesn't happen to be our 
thing.  That's not a dis to the style, but we are in a dreary old steel 
town, the dark side seems to fit us better.

Wait until summer and lets see what happens.  When the weather warms up, 
maybe the vibe will, too.  What else can you do?  Sit home and bitch?  
It's risky and difficult to set up a party, but if you think you can get 
the vibe your looking for, than DIY.

All I can say is, don't give up hope and support the sounds and promoters 
you enjoy.  Market economy will prevail.

man...i don't know about the rest of ya'll, but if i hear a jungle track
with a Dr. Dre/Snoop Dogg/NWA whateva lyric in it...i just wanna go KILL
someone!
j/k.
i guess i'm just different in that the samples/beats, etc, in a piece of
music, don't really affect my vibe in the way that some people are
complaining about.  i mean, i LOVE jungle w/hip-hop/gangsta lyrics in
'em...but they don't give me an angry feeling or anything.  hmmmm, maybe
what we need is a hardstep track with some "Sound of Music" samples.

hm.. what to say really. no need to quote any of it.
but i can understand the feeling of being let down by raves in pittsburgh.
i came here from rochester NY. the scene there is super small, but simple. no
image.. just simple. not alot of raves happened, but when they did they we're
fun, not always having big lights, if any..
people gathered to a secret warehouse [no one ever knew where untill the
night of the event.] and people just danced and had fun.

here their is an image of whats cool in the ravers here.
UDG try's to do what they can. but its hard. i respect what they do. and they
keep stuff hapening here. the lack of raves this month come from the ffact
that for the last couple of weeks UDG has been working revamping club 168
[once club joy]
they are opening a coffe house on the second floor and a record store. right
now they are also currently working with future shock [witch im am a part of]
to throw a hugh ass party this summer, plus they are still doing little
things here and there.
the people of UDG probly arn't sleeping? i don't know.

but speaking for future shock. we're a group of people who are new to
pittsbrugh, and feel the lack of faimly or fun in the scene here. we're going
to try and do everything legal, to take the partys back to warehouse's and
making them fun, with new talent, and new styles coming into pittsburgh. more
techno. more techno.. back to what it was. there is lots of new music, with
new feels, but still based off the old feeling of early ravein'. raves are
the only venue around to hear techno..  underground techno. not commercial
techno, played in clubs.

this summers party _reality_ should be great!
just look at who we have.
mark gage.. orginal techno, played totaly live.
auto kinetic also all orginal, played live. they're bring all there old as
sh*t analog equitment down here to pump out killer weird techno for us.

it'll be supa, and we're hoping to restore some of the feel that pittsburgh
has seemed to have lost.
not only that, we're are going to try and do it, so you guys pay a little as
possible. right now we're hoping[but not garenteed] to be albe to sell
pre-sale tickets at 15$.. 15$!!! look at the line up! and more people are
still being worked on. we're talking over 12hours here! international'y
famous live acts!

so to Ryu.. we're doing what we can. keep smiling.. "the future is here"

.bleep.

I may have a theory as to why there are few raves coming up in the 'burgh:

Is it possible that many of the promoters are in college?  If so, there 
are finals coming up, and studying for them kind of limits your free 
time.  Admittedly, I don't know many promoters (I don't know any at all), 
but it's about the only thing I can think of.

Very true.  You never know if you can jump the guard rail until you leave 
the ground.

Ryu wasn't expressing dislike of new music I don't think, except for
the angry stuff.  He WAS however saying that the music being played in
Pittsburgh seems to go nowhere.  He said in his post that part of what
excited him so much about "techno" was the way it had progressed, and
that this progression seemed to be lacking lately in the Pittsburgh
rave scene.  Take for example, the fact that many people are STILL
playing that sm:)e floor filler "radiate" out at parties. WHY!?
Because all the pburgh kiddies like it and don't bother to strike out
on new ground... just an example...

hey there - i have a question:  

does anyone know anything about a 5-day cruise/rave thing happening in
august?  if so...could you tell me whatever you know... thanx

teehee - did anyone catch the HARDCOPY coverage of "Desert Raves" on wed. may
8?  It was quite funny, hardcopy sent a few people to a rave out in
california in the middle of the desert and toted along a home camera.  :)
 they taped some wacky stuff (i felt sorta bad for the kids who got taped -
they were babbling out some stuff that im sure they wouldn't have wanted to
be nationally broadcasted :) )  It looked like a really fun party! (sorta
made me want to go try em out - these desert raves - i heard they have em in
arizona too) but it also was the normal NEGATIVE publicity.  *sigh*  the
hardcopy anchor woman was like,  "Do you know what your child is doing late
at night this weekend?  Well...we thought you should know about these wild
parties of drugs, alcohol, sex and mayhem" then proceded to intervew kid
after kid who was suckin on a balloon, one kid who was trashed and sittin in
his car which was completely demolished (it looked like he must have run into
one of the mts in the desert there)  i dunno, just your general wasted
children who saw nothing wrong with sharing their philosophies and
experiences on drugs with the nice people with the camera... too bad it was
hard copy.  

welp...if anyone knows anything about that cruise thing could you give a
yell? thanx

lots of luv
leah

hi all...:)

        sorry for the crosspost, but danny (dj slant) from 2tuff asked me
to post to the net regarding the rumours that have been circulating
regarding whether or not ltj bukem would actually appear at the upcoming
renegades 2 this sat (may 11) in washington dc.

        some things 2tuff wants you to know:

        first off, the reason 2tuff went ahead and got bukem again for
renegades 2 was to make up for the fact that he was unable to spin at the
first one.  they highlight these reasons on the flyer (namely, difficulties
in obtaining a work permit and problems with u.s. customs stemming from the
government shutdown)

        2tuff is 100% aware that their reputation as legitimate (and the
foremost) east coast jungle promoters is on the line.  they would not go to
the time, trouble and *considerable* expense to fly over bukem, mc conrad,
and slipmaster j if they were not satisfied that they would be able to make
it.

        the only thing that is out of their control is if bukem and kru get
nicked by u.s. customs at the border...however, danny believes that justin
from lucky spin (slipmaster j) has a us passport and he will be the one
carrying the records...

        apart from that, 2tuff has the flight numbers and confirmed seat
reservations for the three, the fax copy of the tickets, and the reciepts
showing the tickets have been paid for.

        danny has talked to the pr agent from good looking and shes told
him that they (glr) are looking fwd to working with 2tuff for future events
including the upcoming good looking records tour...

        dj kaos from philly has talked to ltj's gf and she assures him he
will be there...:)

        the point is these rumours, while founded in past events, do not
necessarily hold true for each and every event.

        please accept 2tuff's promise that they have taken every step they
can to assure you of a top night with each and every dj on the bill
confirmed to appear.

        in addition, there may be a few special surprise guests, no names
will be mentioned, but if u hear some names being bandied about, you'd be
well off not to doubt it...:)

        i will be at the event that nite, please feel free to come up and
say hi, i may be mc'ing for method one, so look for me then...otherwise if
you'd like to reply to me personally via email, please feel free, i havent
posted in a long time, but i again have access...


peace out + see you on saturday,
hosasm/sphinx

Moreover, his message wasn't sent to the list... it was sent to someone
who then forwarded it to the list.  So not only is it pointless to try to
refute his personal opinions, it's also a bit out of line.  It's easy to
see how his message could stir some commotion, however.

Um, that's the media.  That's the world.  That's the government and the 
parents and the conservatives, and weak reporting because IT HAS FUCKING 
BEEN DONE 583,530,754,834,9126,406.4  TIMES!  Leave it to Hardcopy (and 
american television) to give you the same old fucking crap.  (I take 
careless media as a personal affront...)

I hope to get info.  If I do, I'll pass it along.  If it's what I'm 
thinking of, there was supposed to be sort of a dry run of the same thing 
around the 4th of July.  But I haven't heard anything...

i'm not saying that the music has stagnated all over.  in fact, i think that
everything has progressed more since 94 than ever before! (perhaps too much
in some ways)
but, pittsburgh is another story. 
if all i knew of techno (yeah, i said the t word) was what i heard at pitt
raves, then i'd also see life through paper towel rolls.
i am not blaming anyone in particular.
no one dj, no one promoter, no one raver.  it's just change.  it is inevitable.
as it swings in one direction, it swings in the other, and it can't be stopped.
perhaps i am just angry at time...if i feel the need to direct my anger towards
anything in particular then "damn you clock....damn you to hell!".
the dawn of the rave movement was just a frame in time.  it was meant to
change, and it is pointless to be hung up on that short period of a few odd 
years.  i guess i'm just a bit nostalgic (sp?) because of my own personal
memories of the music of that day.  kinda like my dad and the temptations 
i guess.

 I still listen to my Omni

no.  absolutely not.

 It seems like a lot of

yes, i agree that the gangster type stuff is not getting as big as i once
thought.
but from what i know (which may not be much) most of the newer jungle is 
jazzier, laid back, and more chillish.  i love this type of music...at home.
it really don't get me jumpin' though...
and when it's played at raves, it makes me want to go lay against a wall
more than reach for the stars.
i'm sure that there are plenty of jungle producers and dj's now who play
a more uplifting sound...but they aren't in pittsburgh.

you are exactly right there.  i am dumb to expect anything to

i see your point, but when i am in darkness, the last thing i want is 
more darkness.  light is what i crave.
again, i'm sorry for being negative.  my current 
attitude towards pittsburgh is probably being influenced by the other
things going on in my life right now...so, i may just be melodramatic.
i am sure that things will pick up this summer somehow.

love,

True, but in the forwarded post it was stated that the forward was by

Truth again, this list is hardly anything other than opinion.  I have no
desire to refute opinion or break down in to banter, I tried to make
commentary on the poster's review of the scene here in Pittsburgh, as
people seem to be in slag mode lately. My point, as Adam picked up, was
that there are some hard Jungle tracks out there full of Hip-Hop nastiness
and inuendo that many of us happen to like.  Sorry for those who dislike
that style, but I find the ruff beats and crush basslines are the shit. 
"The shit you just can't fuck with" as they say.  Pittsburgh is a big city
y'all and urban sounds just go with the territory.  For every happy techno
rave you attend, I'll be holding out for the return of "Jungle Warfare"

Why do you say that?  You can get the same tracks in Pittsburgh as you 
can get anywhere else.

You sound like Homer Simpson :-)

Nostalgia is good 'cause all "new" tracks are derived from the sounds 
that we heard in the past.  Shit, the largest proportion of Jungle beats 
(the amen) all come from one soul tune by the Winstons from back in the 
'70's.  However, no matter how much I like "Amen Brother" I much prefer 
the way the 90's have twisted that particular breakbeat.

I don't know what to say here, there are so many styles of Jungle 
nowdays, there must be something that will fit your tastes, not too ruff, 
to too laid back... There may or may not be a happy hardcore DJ in 
Pittsburgh, but there are some DJs here who spin uplifting tracks.

> i'm sure that there are plenty of jungle producers and dj's now who play
> a more uplifting sound...but they aren't in pittsburgh.

Wow, how do you know that?  Have you heard all of the DJs in Pittsburgh.  
What about StarChild?  I think he spins the style you want.  How about 
Soji-Fu?  He told me his newest take on things blends intelligence and 
the darkside.  Doesn't that sound interesting.  Dieselboy has a new tape, 
did you get a copy of that yet?  1.8.7. has a new release, what do you 
think about that one?  Want a copy of my latest mix?  Send me an email and 
I'll get one to you.

Right on, the summer is coming and with it will sure to be another 
uplifting anthem to fit the bill.  

> again, i'm sorry for being negative. 

No need to apologize, if I've learned anything from this list over the 
past few weeks, it's that Pittsburgh is looking for a change.  So long as 
the vibe remains strong, I'll be happy, whatever happens I can still spin 
for myself at home :-)

eflyer had carlos on it, but he wasn't on the flyer I picked up

hope so, that'd make my weekend :)

sure you can buy them, but there aren't many dj's who are playing variety.
oh, yeah...i'm a mobyite in case anyone is interested.
i like unexpected suprises...like a while ago, some dj played
prince's "17 days" at city limits.  i nearly dropped my load in excitement!

this is one of the things i DO like about current jungle.  
there is no shortage on innovation, that's for sure.
but i feel that with all the innovation in jungle, it feels "better" than
the rest of the scene.  when i say "it" i mean the whole movement.
yes, i am stereotyping a bit...sorry.
it seems to be going further and further away from the rave scene.
a complete separation is happening.  i wrote about this a few years
back and was flamed for it, but the segregation is becoming apparent.
it may never fully split in pittsburgh, because we have a comparatively
friendly city...but go to europe.

no, i haven't heard every dj in pittsburgh.  nobody has.
in fact, i haven't been to a rave since fantastic, so things may have changed.
as far as darkside goes...i really do like that style.  go figure.
i usually like ruffian's sets alot too.  but for every non-attitudinal
jungle tune, 
there's 5 of the opposite.

love,
ryu

Gratitude even... I just wanted to tell you guys how much I appreciate
the fact that throughout our discussion of the local scene and where
it is headed, etc. that I am truly grateful and proud that none of us
have resorted to mindless flaming and/or egotistical opinionated
attacks. :) Thanks Toby, Adam, Jon, Tom, and anybody else who has been
contributing to the discussion! :) You guys are all GREAT and I am
happy to see that we can all get along well as RAVERS and PEOPLE and
FRIENDS even :) As I have said in the past, it doesn't matter who you
are or what your favorite style of music is, when the BASS HITS we're
all together jumpin and screamin' RIGHT!? :) :) :) LOVE -Count Zer0

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Hey All,

	Since I've been going off lately about Jungle and the Pittsburgh 
scene, Hip-Hop, HardStep, Jazzy Jungle, etc., I thought I'd let y'all 
know that if you're interested and want to hear what I'm talking about, I 
have a few copies of my 3/96 mixtape available for sale.

Farmer Tea - "Cultivate Breakbeat (3/96)"
90 minutes of Jungle/ Hardstep/ Drum 'n bass
mastered digitally and dubbed to Maxell XL2 high bias tapes, clean livin son!

Side 1 starts of ruff and stays Hardstep throughout with tunes from the 
likes of Cantankerous, The Outlaw, DJ Krust, DJ Rap, DJ Die, L. Double, Shy 
FX, and for Damian and Opus, one track by Lloydie Crucial.

Side 2 chills a bit and brings the drum 'n bass from a soulfull and jazzy 
approach with tracks from Jazz Juice, Hidden Agenda, J. Majik, Lemon D., 
Doc Scott, Photek and others.

So, anyways, if you'd like a copy, $7 and your addy will get one to you 
real quick like.  Of course, promoters can get copies for test if so 
desired. 

Back to the otherwise friendly banter,
                                           Tea

check it one two one two

since i noticed colin hasnt posted these and since i found out the 
deerecs i gave him were slightly faulty, here's the real ones.  

IF ANYONE KNOWS KELL or JESS please give these to them especially kell 
coz i gave him the slightly wrong sirections last night!

ok:  

+ from campus or downtown columbus take 70 E to 270 N, get off at main st.
+ from the north or south take 71 to 270 E and follow 270 for about 15 
  miles to the main st exit. 
+ from the east take 70 W to 270 N to the main st exit.
+ from the west take 70 E through columbus to the easternmost loop of 270, 
  go N to the main st exit.

once everyone is at the main st exit go EAST (away from downtown) on main
st for about 2 miles.  look for a st called wagner/gramm (they're the
same)...there's a state savings on the left if that helps.  once there,
take a LEFT on wagner and immediately look for a tank (military) on the
right, that's it. it's a vfw hall at 1420 wagner.

admish is $8 at the door, goes from about 10.30 till 6.30 am and will be 
followed by an afterhrs at idiot boy.

any problems call 614 341 7305 (collective intelligence)
or
614 470 0929 (ele honkeys) if you wanna hear music an shit :)

also, drive careful because heavy rains are expected tonight.  leave 
early to get here on time, but don't rush!  the last thing we all need is 
an accident...

well, the party was a bust at the original location.  no respect to
2tuff and crew for fuckin' up the space and what not.  totally
incomprehensible how they could not take care of s**t like telling the
fire marshal.  got to takoma park at 12:45 and the music studdenly
stoped and saw all these people filing out and i heard some promoter
talking to the cops and the cop said that hte fire marshall wasn't even
aware there was a party tonight, he lived two block s away and some
neighbors called him. well, to two tuff and crew, i hope you lost a lot
of money on this party, cause you deserve it....

but anyway, went to lonnie's space, not knowing where it was, just
followed some other cars and got there....got in for free, didn't pay
the $20 bucks. thanks raza.....

well, it was an experience to see bukem, but as for the majority of the
crowd there, he didn't really move us....most people were nodding heads,
and his first song was real good, jsut started the mood of fright, and
his last two tracks were the only jump up stuff he played.. but i guess
thatisn't his style. i am sure the bluntedmasses were enjoying it....

but trace the cherub came on and he saved then night for me....he played
this one song with a sax blaring and then a hard tech step beat came in,
anyone know this?????  btw, trace was supposed to be in nyc atjungle
nation....did any ny junglists happen to catch him, or did he not show
up at all?????

trace was showin' off the technical skills on the decks also, cutting in
with some hard drum and bass' and eventually mixing it in ....amazing...

what happenedx to karl  k and hsi phily hardstep inc. tracks?  majority
of the stuff he played was low key tech steppers, nohip hop samples, no
throbbing bassline, nothing....and too bad ak1200 didn't play at the
warehouse. i am sure his drum and bass would have been real
dance-friendly....

so to the 2tuff rep otu there:  what happeend???????

Well, the failed party I tried to throw with some friends was at the same
space as saturday's renegades event.  The owners assured us they had all the
proper permits. Well, when the police showed up they lost it and fled,
claiming they didn't "have a permit to collect money at the door".  They were
actually totally full of it and had none of the required permits.  But, as
Lonnie noted, there were about 120 people there so we weren't making that
much of a ruckus, so they let us be.  So, I am pretty sure the blame comes
down on the owners of the space for misleading 2 Tuff.  I could be wrong...

And just to note, I thought I would try jungle one more time because of the
jungle thred traffic, and also go and support my friends Daniel, Chris,
Chuck, Doug, John G.  Unfortunately, when we pulled up kids were streaming
out of the space, so no dice.  Just saying I *tried* to all you jungle lovers
:)

see you

Well it has begun. Jive Turkeyz are at this moment conspiring to bring you
the first of our free outdoor parties this year, this friday. Loc ation
and maps will be available soon but if you went to any of them last year

since this thread about the turkey parties just erupted, i think its time to
re-introduce myself to this list as being not only a mw-raver but a soon-to-be
pb-cle-raver again! i just want to say hello to all my fellow pb-cle peeps, and to let you know
that i will be returning to wonderful cleveland the second week of june when
school lets out. i am looking forward to partying in cleveland, pittsburgh,
and columbus this summer, (as well as the midwest) as much as my circumstances
will allow, and i hope to meet as many pb-cle netravers as possible!!! so
hopefully i will see you all in a month.  and since count says these friday
parties are 'ALL that and A BIG CRUNCHIN BAG O CHIPZ' i'll definitely attempt
to check that out too.

Hey Turkeys, is this gonna be every Friday?  

My 2 cents...I think maybe the city slept for a few weeks--and there was 
much whining and gnashing of teeth--but I have a good feeling about this 
summer.  And you would do well not to doubt female intution...  ;)  steph

Hey, I'm really sad that I missed the party at the Agora this Sunday, did
anyone go?  How was it?  How many people showed up?  Is there more than
one room of djing at the same time?

I really can't stand most of the people who are showing up to Trilogy on
Sunday nights these days (despite the excellent music and lighting), so I
expect Covert to really take off.  I sincerely hope that we support it as
best we can during the early stages of its existence.

I really don't see how, we can continue all this complaining about how
everyone else is ruining the scene when we all stand by and do nothing to
educate or help out.  It seems rare these days that people pick up their
trash at a party, look out for each other, and make new people feel
welcome... it's not entirely their faults....
==================================================================

i tried.

it cost me.

hey kell, i am still interested in that dieselboy/scott henry 
mixed tape that i saw @ yur stand @ AM&Z, but wuz unable to
afford. can i send u money for it?

==================================================================

here's my mini review of it that i posted to another response off
of mw-raves...

ed sed:
=================================================================
...on the way to Afros Macs and Zodiacs. Hmmm, where to begin?
I went to my friend john's house to hang out for a bit before going
to the party. We ran outa dew so decided to head across the street
to the gas station to get some. We walked out of the complex to the crosswalk.
Just then a cop car pulled and some crazy cop jumped outa her car, gun
drawn, and put us on the ground. FIVE more cars roll up like bats
outa hell and out leap cops pushin us to the ground and darin us to 
fuckin move (their words). After bein cuffed and groped, poked and 
prodded we were put in cars while they ran our id. Turns out a guy 
matchin my description burned some fuckin building down the street
===========================(clip)=================================

funny reminds of the story when jinx, walt, & gank got pulled over
on the way home from columbus to cleveland on 71 after Fun House
(the party where jinx & rage got in that li'l scuffle). five cop
cars came, threw 'em on the ground, searched them & their car head
to toe & they spent two hours downtown only to find that they weren't
the ones who comitted a supposed 'drive by shooting' in columbus.

on a lighter note, jinx & rob made up. in fact rob made a surprise
appearance appearance @ jinx b-day party @ the Edge (thanx to a
certain some one who shall remain nameless ;) who made a couple
phone calls) jinx has moved to columbus & helped jason to throw the
'save the idiot party' which went off quite succesfully this past   
saturday. walt has also moved to columbus also & just threw 'said
party' along w/ the help of a few others (melissa, colin, desmond,
jenn, todd, etc) known as Collective Intelligence formely known as
Joint Ventures ('til a certain some one who again shall remain 
nameless had to inform 'em that there already wuz a more established
Joint Ventures production crew on the east coast). Gank wuz just
recently dragged down to columbus (again by the that same certain
some one who shall remain nameless ;) ) for Generator, the bomb
party, thrown by ele mental & the illuminators last weekend. Gank
has established himself as one of the more promising up & coming
dj's in the northern ohio area & is currently working w/ his crew
- spawntaneous who along w/ psychoactive records, threw 420 (the
largest party ever in ohio) & just recently started up the new
sunday night out known as Covert.

on an even lighter note Covert kicked off it's opening night w/ a
bang in typical spawntaneous fashion. not only wuz there amazing
music provided by the likes of The Funkian Tribe, Dan Curtin,
Gank, Tik Tak, Pulse, and Sparx. but the night also featured a
few extra surprises that i don't even think gank or chris knew
about including a native american lady who thought a certain 
someone who again shall remain nameless wuz 'the one' and a female
dancer from the entertainment family who chose to display some of
her better physical attributes over the head of a certain some one
who yet again shall remain nameless on top of the bar from which
he wuz sitting at. the public display ended when a beer bottle
wuz involved & things got a li'l too risque.

- a certain some one who shall remain nameless ;)

ltj bukem showed....and it was *wonderful*


first off, big respect goes out to 2tuff for being the first stateside
junglepromoters (that i know of, correct me if i'm wrong) to actually allow
usthe opportunity to witness ltj bukem _touching down_.

after a hellish trip down that included leaving pittsburgh an hour and a
half late, (thru no fault of my own!) overshooting the exit we were
supposed to take on 495 by 30 min (coz our navigator was asleep...again,
not me) and getting to the first site only to find it shut down, we were
pretty cranky....

when we got to the first space, i ran into my friends chris and johng..they
told us the site had been moved to lonnie's warehouse and that yes, bukem
had made it.. in fact, he was catching a nap in a car near us :)

we weren't too thrilled with the idea of driving another hour to baltimore
from dc, but the prospect of driving another 5 hrs back to pittsburgh,
after already being cramped in a vw rabbit with 3 other fairly large guys
didnt appeal to us too much either, but back we went.

when we got to lonnie's warehouse, the parking lot was as full as I'd ever
seen it for any of the raza parties or afterhours that have been held
there, i was glad to see that but soon i realised that was a bad thing,
because it was crowded!

we walked up the stairs and when we got to the door, i looked for someone
checking the guest list, but there was no one.. in fact, there was no one
even taking money... i realised this was a free party at this
point...wicked :)

it was really crowded once inside...and hot..and smokey...we went to see
who was spinning and my friend said 'that looks like dj rap'...it was karl
k...i thought that was one of the funniest things i heard all nite :)
(2tuff did bring in dj rap and taylor in place of bukem for the first
renegades, so i can understand chuck may have said that hoping it was a
special surprise return by rap :)

as kenny eng said (pretty good review of what the dj's spun, kenny)
karl was spinning pretty low key techstep...but judging from his drooping
eyelids, i think he was just spinning what he felt at the moment...

karl's set wound down and i heard whispers of 'i think bukem's going on
next!'


and sure enuff, the man like ltj (el-dj) bukem (as in book'em
danno...bukem's first name is danny) stepped up...and he *represented*

i've been listening to jungle/breaks for almost 4 years now, been to loads
of parties where jungles been played, and a couple of massives with uk dj's
as well, perhaps it was due to the intimacy of the venue,
but never have i been closer to what i felt was a true jungle
vibe...and it was all due to world-class dj ltj bukem and 2tuff...respect.


what was bukem's set like?...jazz inna year 4000.  to me, it sounded like
futurisitic, extremely smooth, laid back tracks like the ones at the
beginning of dieselboy's side of east coast science vol. 1 (PLUG PLUG...get
this tape)...some of the tracks would build and build and keep going until
you were almost fearful in your anticipation (like you were looking over
the edge of a cliff), and then the breakdown would come in (and you
jumped), and then you would roll on in blissful serenity (your chute opened
and you floated gently back to earth)...

it was absolutley fucking wicked. :)

during bukem's set, lonnie & co. also hooked up the amps which boosted the
sound up at least twice as loud as the previously modest levels, and got
the microphone working as well, which allowed the mc conrad the opportunity
to flex his skills...he showed how it should be done, delivering rhymes in
styles that were a perfect accompaniment to bukem's lush tracks...with each
amazing record, conrad got us junglists pushing up on our lighters and
yelling as bukem brought the choon in the most proper jazzstep fashion.

seemed like the whole place had its jaw on the floor the entire time...we
all wanted the man to keep spinning forever, everyone thought that trace
should have gone on before bukem, so nothing would interrupt this work of
art...but as all good things must come to an end, so did this set. i was
afraid that bukem had worked too hard to bring it down to the level he had,
but by the end of his set (which was just the right length), i was ready to
hear to some harder jump up stuff...


big fat 'dubplate duncan' (aka dj trace...;) hit the decks and gave us all
a sampling of what darkness for the rest of '96 is going to sound like..
dark techstep bizzness..don't really recall too much of his set tho, i was
busy walking around and chatting up my friends...


after trace, rob paine came on, which was a total surprise because the
houseroom that was supposed to be at the first site was nixed when it got
movedto lonnie's....he opened up with the 'classic' track by mother 'all
funkedup' and al the kids who had been hoping to hear house that nite let
out a
collective scream (or was it a sigh of relief) and rushed the floor...but
it did put a smile on my face...:) (i am not bashing house, don't get me
wrong)

in all, it was *well* worth it to hear bukem alone.. anything you hear
about how amazing this guy was *is true*...too bad he looked kinda
bored/nonchalant, but i see how he could have been sorta buggered by the
nites happenings...

im not gonna focus on what went wrong...i ultimately had one of the best
nites out at this party, and i know that 2tuff tried..yes it
was a pain that we *all* had to go north again to bmore, but bukem was
there and for me that was good enuff.

big respect goes out to 2tuff productions, lonnie, and all involved with
getting this event together...your next one will be even bigger and better!

maximum boost to all my friends, old and new (you know who you are)...see
you all at happiness (or maybe old skool buzz the nite before even).

finally, shout out to all the junglettes in attendance -- nice to see new
ppl getting into the sound, apart from a bunch of crusty old guys...easy.
;)

hold tight all massive,
hossam/mc sphinx

Subject: DUNE:  The real story
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk



Hello friends to the East,

I'm from the Socal raves list and felt that it was important that you hear this.

As you may or may not know by now, the slime show that is Hard Copy did a piece
on a desert rave last Wednesday.  A VERY negative piece.

The rave that they showed (with the exception of a few clips) was DUNE, a rave
put on by several socal ravers including myself.  

We are deeply saddened that the media (if you can call Hard Copy media) has once
again choosen to misrepresent our scene. Contrary to their reporting, there were
no deaths and Rangers and an ambulance were present at the entire event.  They
also claimed that we have these desert raves because of innercity gang violence
and "deadly" fires.  There hasn't been one shooting or deadly fire in the
history of LA raves.

The piece called our desert rave a booze and sexy orgy, which is a total joke.
HARD COPY totally misrepresented DUNE and we apologize for any embarassment or
problems that their piece may cause your rave community. 

We are very, very proud of DUNE and feel you should hear the real story.

DUNE happened on March 23rd and was the brainchild of several people from the
socal raves list.  All involved in DUNE felt like they had gotten so much out of
the scene that we wanted to give something back. We were also fed up with greedy
promoters and an increase in the number of parties being busted.  

So, instead of bitching about it, we decided to take action. We accomplished
this by putting on an legal (not for profit) party in the desert with an amazing
atmosphere, spirituality and vibe.   Los Angeles' top DJ's (Christopher
Lawrence, Lee, Doran and Thee-O) understood what DUNE was about and volunteered
their substantial services.  We also hired one of LA's top sound companies to
provide 4 speaker stacks of the most amazing sound i've ever heard.

The party was 100% legal.  We worked closely with the Bureau of Land Management
to ensure that this party would not be busted.  We paid the overtime salaries
(not cheap) of 4 Sherriffs so that they could be at the party all night.  We
paid to have an ambulence at the party the entire time.  We wanted to show
ravers that not all authority figures are against us, while at the same time
proving to the Rangers that raves are not the evil parties that the media paints
them to be.  They were impressed with the party and days later, commented that
the site we used was cleaner than before we got there.

The location about 2.5 hours out of L.A. in the middle of the desert.  The site
was surrounded by an enormous U-shaped grouping of rocks that created a
spectacular natural rock ampatheather. We had two huge projection screens with
incredible visuals as well as lighting projected directly on the rocks and
ground.  

The party officially went from 11pm-noon (from 9-11 we let some djs from the
socal list spin) and we charged only $5 with the hope of possibly breaking even. 
Over 2,000 happy people showed up to help make it an incredible experience for
all.  To top it off, the comet was overhead and was mind-blowingly beautiful to
say the least (it was the size of the moon and the tail went 1/3 of the way
across the sky).

We encourage you to check out our website which now includes pictures and
reviews of the event. Http://home.earthlink.net/~sarahtonen

Also, we hope to do another DUNE sometime in Sept., so if you'd like to be a
part of this positive event, send me an email and i'll put you on our mailing
list. We'd love to include our brothers and sisters from other cities in this
plurry event. 

Peace and don't believe the hype,

Brad

First off i a writting this as a neutral party in this whole matter. i 
just thought everyone should know excatly what the real problem is in 
this matter.  

Sorry for the massive cross post.

The reason why massive is not doing the sound this year at even furthur 
in wisconson is because the drop bass network is cheap. Kurt of dbn and 
frenche of maxxium both agreed on a price for frenche to bring his sound 
to EF over the phone. Then kurt sent frenche a faxed contract with a 
lower price than they both agreed over the phone. So, frenche backed out 
the deal and is not bringing the maxxium sound to Even furthur. This is 
pretty sad for Kurt to make on agreement then wuss out. it is also false 
advertising on the even furthur flyer. 

I didn;t get this information directly, so i might not have it all 
right.  BUT, This information was brought to my attention so thought i 
would do something about it.  I am asking everyone who is going to 
furthur to call the main info lines and bitch about the fact that maxxium 
is not doing the sound in hopes of getting maxxium back on the job.

I have never heard the new maxxium system and i want to. supposedly this 
systemis the loudest and clearest sound in the midwest. This system is so 
loud that people have become sick because of the BASS. I want to puke 
because it is so loud, but now it looks like i might not beable to 
because kurt is too cheap to bring frenches system. well please call and 
bitch. i did. the Main line numbers are:

Damn... I won't be home until Sunday... Well, best o' luck... It might be 
a good idea to leave a box o' donut bait at the end of the drive to keep 
the authorities happy!

BTW: Pittsburgh, the Turkeyz are giving you something special!  Respect 
the area and keep the tagging in your own backyard-- it makes it easier 
for everyone, and no one has to deal with any reprocussions...

Yes, finally a mailing lists devoted to electro and break styles has come
into effect.  It's subject will encompass electro of any nature (from
detroit, old school, post-jungle, etc.) to breaks.  Not hip hop style, not
breakbeat (145bpm) not jungle or drum n bass, but breaky house and techno
and just plain break oriented dance or intelligent.

subscribe @
majordomo@tiger.coe.missouri.edu

in the body of the message write
subscribe electro-breaks

just thought i would say a little somethin about trout soup's
weekly thing in youngstown, oh, cuz it's 7am and i am tired and
talkative.  anyway, we actually pulled in some djs from around
the way (mike fifer, brian somethinorother, and count zero).

everyone was good and the atmosphere was tight and friendly,
but i just have to say that pittsburgh's own count zero rocks!
ok, maybe not rocks, cuz he spins ambient, but how bout this:

                  count0 rulez!  ;)

anyway, if you haven't heard him, check him out.  get absolute
zero, book him, whatever, he's good.
i had a lot of fun so i'll say thanx jamie at this point.

thanks for being patient...hopefully this will reach some of you out 
there.  i would have given this info out before, but the space came down 
to the wire (last-minute changes required a change of venue) and i didnt 
want to post info unless it was secure.

anyway, here's how to get to the event:

the space is at the YMCA gymnasium in downtown columbus, address 40 west 
long st.

from the N take 71 S to 670 W towards downtown, follow 670 to the THIRD ST
ramp.  go down two lights to SPRING ST, take a RIGHT.  pass 1 light (high
st) and take a LEFT at the first alley after high st (WALL ST).  go south
one block and the space is to the right, on the northwest corner of wall st 
and long st.  there's plenty of parking all around. 

from the S take 71 N to 670 and follow as above.

from the E or W, take 70 to columbus, to 71 N, to 670 W and follow 
as from the north.

once you arrive, enter the long st entrance and go up two small flights 
of stairs up to the 2nd floor gymnasium.  

please keep the following things in mind:

- bathroom access will be limited so please come prepared!
  renovations are being done on the space, so their accessible bathrooms 
  have been removed.  this means bathrooms will only be accessible in an 
  off-limits area so we will have to monitor each person that goes.  sorry!!
- please respect the gym floor, wear sneakers or something like that (doh)
- no liquids in the gym, but there will be plenty of water and a smartbar 
  by UTOPIA (yum)
- admission will be $5 at the door and probably go lower if we break even.
- there may be two columbus police officers there (they're really cool) 
  for everyone's safety...they're not there to harass anyone or bust the 
  event so be nice ;)
- finally, have fun or i will personally punch your lights out ;)

ok, and the lineup (drumroll please)

from 11pm-6am, in order of appearance (45-min sets):

gleek - detroit-style
i/d - hardtraxx
todd sines - minimal traxx, electro
placebo - houseytraxx, ele traxx :)
drift - hardtrance
doughboy - hardtraxx and mini GABBA set!!
ihannoa - live techno phatness
rob engel - house, techno
lunar - mini jungle set (hee hee)
monochrome - live jungle fuzzy logic
titonton - techno & jungle turntable mayhem
kingsize - jangool closeout

arrighty, i guess that's it...see you there!!!

	The Jive Tuekyz bring you....bullshit.

	I'm posting this to the list for a reason. To begin with, Rick didn't
	clear this with ANY of the other Turkeyz, he went off, booked these
	DJ's, and posted this without conculting any of us, teamwork. 
	Yeah Rick.

> Turkey Line : 412.761.8173

	Kids, don't call this line, I own it, it's the Aleph line, and seeing
	as how NO ONE asked me, and no one spoke to me about this party, there
	won't be any info on it.

> 100% FREE - 100% Renegade - 100% FUN
	
	100% bullshit. You have NO idea how angry I am about this. I'm sure
	most of you guys don't know, but the last party would have NEVER
	gone off had I not taken care of EVERYTHING (except the generator)
	including: picking up and PAYING for the sound equipment (and I still
	haven't seen any of this "donation" money that rick TOOK last night),
	making the directions, putting the directions up at 168, the use of
	my info line that I ALONE pay for, and the general coordination of
	the party. The one task that I actually needed Rick to carry out
	was getting 1200's, which he FAILED to do.

	In essence, I spent a lot of time and a lot of money putting that
	party together, and I didn't ask for anything except for everyone to
	have a good time. But I DID REQUEST last fucking night that we wait
	a little bit to plan out the next one better, the other members
	agreed, noting that next weekend is already busy with big parties,
	both here AND in Philly. But Rick chose to ignore this.

	I know this may seem petty, but if you understood the work that
	went into last night's party, and the ideals we've tried to hold
	for the Jive Turkeyz (ie: TEAMWORK), this hurts.

	Rick, to you. Please, please don't ask for my help, don't expect me
	to come and rescue you like I did last time because you wanted to
	lead but didn't know where to go.

Does anyone have any final word on the party? Especially are Hyperactive 
and Dan Bell still supposed to be there?

Several people's mailboxes have been overflowing, and when that happens,
messages start bouncing back from the list.  Part of maintaining the list
involves removing email addresses that start to cause problems, so
remember: if you suddenly stop receiving pb-cle-raves email, chances are
something strange happened and I had to remove you.  Just re-sub and all
should be fine.

	Hey kids...

	I wanted to let everyone know that Rick and I have spoken, and
	we've worked things out. I think he just prolly got swept up

	it's all good. This party is still going on, with the addition

Glad to see that you guys have worked it all out, we need to stick 
together to keep the underground scene strong!  Efforts like these are 
what raving is aaallll about, kids!  Screw the commercialism, screw the 
attitudes... Be into it for the love of the music and each other!

a suggestion:  WHEN (not IF) you call, tell them it was shitty to do a 
shit-talking story on a nice scene, but to make the argument stronger, 
tell them their *journalism* SUCKS as well--they are not doing their jobs, 
you can see through their cheap appeals to fear and conservatism, and you 
don't like their post-Geraldo antics one damn bit.  

I say this b/c they don't care that much about the opions about the scene 
that the members themselves hold (they're interested in a good story) but 
to tell them that their story was bad, very bad, and you trust any 
subsequent stories even less than before, is something they might 
actually listen to.  You're in their target market.  Let them know it's 
NOT SELLING.

another suggestion:  (which I really need to follow MYSELF before I get on 
another soapbox ;) watch the thing first so you know of which you speak, 
unlike the "reporters".  as a wise, "Worth"y man once said, "Let's show 
'em what we got."

Hear hear!  Now uhh...  how to go about doing this :-)  I would love
to give a piece of my mind and show some support but frankly HardCopy
isn't on my list of must see T.V.  Any way to get ahold of a transcript
from the show around here?  Anyone have such a beast on a WEB page
or something?  To make them eat their words Id have to have a copy of
them handy...  :-)

        'Hard Copy's recent piece regarding the dangers of  rave culture
is yet another rehash of the sensationalist tactics used by the media to
demonise those operating outside established legal/social constraints.  By
presenting the rave scene in a derogatory light public opinion grants the
power to shut down gatherings and arrest whomever they wish with no public
outcry or intervention.

        The draconian English Criminal Justice Bill  (which outlaws any
gathering of over ten people without a permit, as well as the right to
silence) is a prime example of direct action taken by government to stop
young people from gathering, expressing ideas, and having a good time.
The English government told the public that the 'Suss' laws were designed
to stop ravers from gathering in England, yet they are much further reaching.
Could this happen in the US - well the Exxon Bill passed didn't it?

        Raves provide a safe environment for young and old people to dance,
enjoy, express and explore themselves. The Rave Culture stands for Peace,
Love, Unity and Respect. Many lives have been touched and changed by this
movement.

        We propose a documentary project to show the positive facets of Rave
Culture.  We want to turn this project into a group endeavor, collaboration
is essential.  Since we will be operating on a 'no budget' we plan to 
film for
the most part in California and will be compiling footage over the summer.
If you would like to participate in the project and you are outside of
California you can send a video (high-8, super 8, vhs, etc.) to us.  We plan
to edit the material at the end of the summer.

        We will not film at any rave without the permission of the promoters
and participants.  We do not want to be confused with another "Hard Copy"
undercover agent.  Any assistance from promoters would be very welcome.  If
you are throwing a rave and would like to participate in the project, please
let us know.

message to majordomo@underground.org with a body of:

i apologize for the missed calendar last week, but things didn't go my 
way most of the week.  anyhow here it is....

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkII
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Submissions to: s0176326@cc.ysu.edu (preferred) or

this is very old news, but I'm still catching up...
found a used copy of "Jungle Warfare", cheesy cover, but with the likes 
of LTJ Bukem and DJ Hype on it.  from like 94 I think.  Any opinions on 
it?  (In other words, is it worth the 8 bucks?)

he he, like that sub heading?

well i know some of you arent going to be able to head up to the 
gathering in wisconsin, so here's an alternative for you:

fri 24 may
columbus ohio

a two-part evening

(1) 

Beryllium - (Be)

live electronic performances by

THE EVOLUTION CONTROL COMMITTEE

                 D.A.C. CROWELL

                           (23)

9PM-1AM
ives hall, corner of woodruff and neil ave on the OSU campus

(2) 

POTENT PERCUSSION vol 2
featuring
UFO (san francisco)
TROLL (cbs cincinnati)
MONOCHROME, ATMAN, and LUNAR

directions:

from all points get to the 11th ave exit off of I 71, go west one mile to
the 1st light (GRANT ST), take a quick RIGHT and then a quick LEFT to
CHITTENDEN.  stay on chittenden for about 3-4 lights to HIGH ST, take a
RIGHT.  go north about 10 blocks and find a Wendy's on high st at the
corner of woodruff and high, then find some parking.  

please be careful where you park because they will tow you unless you are
in a normal spot (so dont park at wendy's!).  and there will be no parking
near the space (coz parking on campus requires a student parking decal or
whatever...unless you want to risk getting a ticket from the OSU ppl).

once you find woodruff, walk west onto the OSU campus for about 3 blocks 
and find IVES HALL at the corner of woodruff and neil.  go around to the 
back door and enter there into a large central hallway.

if you arrive late and notice no activity there, that means the event has 
been moved to a secondary location.  look for a sign on the door giving 
you detailed directions to that location.

hope some of you can come out to this, dac is bringing his theremin, and 
these performances should all be pretty phat.

oh, and btw the $2 is a DONATION, not a requirement.  so no excuses!

Hi Steven,

        Thanks for this information I was not aware this film existed.
Any idea where one may find a copy? BTW, we see our film being more
political that just interview with some DJs but I guess without seeing
the film I can really tell. So if you know of any where where I could
pick it up let me know.
====================================================================  

bob brown sed:
====================================================================
Hey....do you have a copy of this film???  The one from 93.

Bob.
====================================================================   

actually i saw a copy of NATION OF SOUND here in cleveland of all places
at the record store in Trilogy Night Club (yup u'll hafta come back to 
ohio if u wanna copy bob - btw r u coming back for FA2?). but not only
does the film feature interviews but it shows party footages in the
various cities also. the Nation Of Sound tour info # on the flyer is
213.960.5550. but i'm purdy shore it might be disconnected by now since
it wuz put out in '93.

sara aka galaxy girl aka that web page chick sed:
======================================================================
Yeah, they were here in AZ, too...don't forget us.  I still have the event
flier and everything...but never saw the finished piece...hmmmmm


=) Sarah Gianetto =)  
======================================================================= 

ahhh ms. gianetto, how goes the plur t-shirt biz? just remember who came
up w/ the idea 1st ;). yup got the flier too (prolly one of the earliest
a&a graphics flyers). and as i said above the film exists and it was 
documented by Michael Stein. btw r u aware there's a galaxy girl in
baltimore also? not only does she spin, but she wuz part of the original
cybertribe posse @ Family Affair, and she wuz also the 1st recipient of
my original 'plur' t-shirt as a prize for the FA photo ID contest i had
for the september '95 issue of PLRM. 

ooh hey, have u bumped into Tristesse, the arizona fly rave chica lately?
if u do tell her i bumped into lisa lee @ 420. she (like a few others)
wuz lucky to be alive for the party.

merritt sed:
========================================================================  
yea!!!  the dallas scenes were filmed at the club that i spun &
worked lights at- Lizard Lounge...man i had forgotten about that!

Lizard Lounge..hmm i think ronnie diorio mentioned that place before.
ever heard of him? just got outta jail in texas & i bumped into him @
420 in cleveland also.

MORE BILL COOPERISMS & A HARD COPY TIE IN:

a find it ironic that Hard Copy would air a biased video of a rave in
the desert and not air a quintessential video of the JFK assasination.
becuz two hours before the critical video was to be aired it was killed
by an NBC head. becuz NBC is controlled by the Council of Foreign
Relations and in part by the Defense Industrial Complex (DIC). the
media can be controlled since it is controlled by its advertising. the
DIC provides over 85% of the advertising income for all the TV networks
and the major newspapers. in addition 80% of the american people work
for the DIC one way or another. our entire economy is a war based 
economy based on the DIC. people in san diego probably know this the
best because of all the military complexes in that area. how does the
government control tv anchorman? by paying them $2 million a year 
instead of $50,000 for doing what they tell them to do.

---

on now...

in the beginning there was jack, and jack had a groove, and from
this groove came the groove of all grooves. and while one day
viciously throwing down in his box, jack boldly declared, "let
there be house", and house music was born. "i am, you see, i am
the creator, and this is my house, and in my house there is only
house music. but i am not so selfish, because once you've been to
my house, it then becomes our house and our house music. and you
see no one man owns house, because house music is a universal
makeup spoken and understood by all. you see, house is a feeling,
and no one can understand the feeling unless he's deep into our
house. house is an uncontrollable desire to jack your body, and
as i told you before, this is our house and our house music, and
every cop should understand that for the people, and in this house
of the people is jack. now some of you might wonder, who is jack
and what it is that jack does. jack is the one who gives you the
power to do a state, jack is the one who learns you how to work
your body, jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of
all peoples together under one house. you may be black, you may be
jew or gentile, it don't make no difference in our house...


have u figured out who the REAL Jack is yet?

Yes, I am aware.  I didn't know she existed when I took the name OFF A
TEESHIRT from Contempo...I didn't think anyone would use that name for
something serious.  I just use it on IRC, I don't go around calling myself
Galaxy Girl.

He.  Yes, he lives in Tucson, unless there's another.  But he's not on our
mailing list anymore, so I don't correspond with him.

i haven't posted in a while - so i have a few unrelated things to say :)

___
i saw the Hardcopy thing - it made me sad and it made me laugh, because i
HATE the media coverage of raves.  It makes me cringe.  I also once saw
another nationally televised thing like the hardcopy one, it was maybe a year
or two ago, but just as bad - i think it was Eye Witness News or Eye on
America, something like that.  It was covering raves in CA, and trashing the
whole scene, pretty much asserting it was all about pot and acid.  The
hardcopy one just went on to assert raves were about alcohol and nitrous
oxide, sex, danger, death....etc...etc...etc. It was certainly a provacative
piece of journalism and i think it is up to us to take the bait, respond, and
show them that we can insult their work - just as they insult ours.

For anyone who didn't see it - i bet you can call up the television station
on that 800 number that was posted earlier, get connected with Hardcopy, and
give them the Date and Title of the desert raves piece and if you say the
right things they will send you a copy.  I had a teacher once who did that
sort of thing, it worked.  For instance... tell them you are in a youth
counciling program and would like to use the video - theyd eat it up and
there is a good chance you would be rewarded with a tape of the broadcast.  I
know it is a little coniving ...but... everyone should really see the piece -
then the station will be more likely to listen to us.

___
On a seperate note...

Last sunday at the agora - Swamp - WOW!  Ive never seen anything like that!
 It blew my little mind. :)  I was just wondering if anyone else on the list
was there.  It was really great.  

___
and another note...

anyone going to Philly this weekend?!?!  I AM!!!!  hehe.  I am so excited i
could pop.  Its my birthday today :) and im going to party my ass off in
philly this weekend! :)  Its even more exciting because im moving to philly
come sept. (im going to the univ of penn) so i am really happy to be able to
check out the scene there before i find myself actually living there and not
knowing anyone or anything :)

so if anyone else is going to philly for the party there sat (it will
definitely be better than milwalke - rabbit in the moon, wink, um.... i know
there is a LIST of AMAZING djs spinning, cant say i can relay them right now
though because they have skipped my mind.  But its going to be good - real
good. :) AND it seems everyone i talk to in cleveland is going down there for
it - so it seems the cleveland scene is relocating for the weekend :) not
really - but... 

____
well thats my two cents...

im still searching for info on that rave cruise thing in late summer - PLEASE
could anyone help me here?

hey - is anyone going to see Terry Mullen in akron tonight?  hope to see you
there - ill be celebrating  my coming of age (yep - i am - WAS - a little
baby, just a youngin', but now im only relatively young :) yet LEGAL :) )

lots of luv
leah

happy people,

i just got back from the renegade big flavor in pittsburgh, and i want
to give my thanks to both d cypol for playing a SUPERFUNKICALIFRAGISEXY
happy hardcore set and to the jive turkeys for booking him.
d cypol is a terrific dj who spun jungle, happy hardcore, and some happy
gabber all in one set!  that's what i like to see.  variety is the spice of
life,
and he who controls the spice controls the universe!  he had all of the people
on the street dancin' like they never danced before!!!!
i really hope that he is booked here again, and i'm sure that the rest of 
those at big flavor hope so too.

thanks again,
love,
ryu
p.s.- does anyone know if he can be contacted via email?

Right on!  All the other Dj's there were good, but d-cypol's set was one 
of the funnest I've heard in a long time. :) :) :)  He deserves to be 
worshipped like a golden calf of joy.  Really, I think lots of kids go 
for the hardcore (happy, gabber, etc..) and it would be heaven if there'd 
be more HC spun at events...really only one dose per night is all I need 
to keep me grinnin' all day. ;)

Also...a special 'woo-ha' for the Jive Turkeyz - two fun party's in two 
weeks - you kids are the greatest! ;P

Uhh ditto :-)  Big ups to all the DJs who spun.  A very cool vibe for
a party with some... setbacks :-)  Not easy to do when spinning in
the trunk of a van!

- David

and thanks to Dan for getting me past one of those setbacks!

heres my nifty(tm) review of the Sunshine Kids Superfly ...

the space ... the irish center in wilkensburgh / squirell hill area of 
pittsburgh ... its been used before but i still liked it ;) being able
to go in and out as u please kicks ass ... also climbing on the roof 
kicked ass till i was asked to get down ;(

the sound ... all the speakers where in front, so the sound up' are (yinezer
phrase meaning up there :)* was nice and loud ... unfortunatly the sound in 
the back wasn't was lound ...

the lights ... notin special ...

the djs ... Dust was a'ight ... played some nice songs just as we were 
entering ... DNA played some good stuff ... cannot remember anything 
off the top of my head ;) ... Devin played two songs that made me 
go bonkers ... "Children", cause i had just bought the CD Single 
(it's domesticated now ... no more import prices ;) and a remix
of "Killing me softly" one of my fav. songs, of course i think that
the song could use a jungle remix ... and i have heard that there
is a version floating round england (any one have da 411 on that ;) ...
Jask played more house ... a couple songs that i would have liked 
to dance to if i wasn't sofriggintired ;) then we left ... so i have
no idear how Sean Ferguson was ....

oh da people were friendly, cept when this local boy came up outside
and tried to create some trouble ;)

don't know if there were any nett'ers there ... i didn't meet any ;( ...
if u were there ... i was the dude in the Cat in the Hat head garment ...
wearin all black and giving out twizzler for a brief period :) (and 
smoking the cloves or beanie sticks as the rasta's call em (least that's
what i have been told ;)

peace
emunster

ps ... wish there had been more trance / goa or jungle ... house is nice ... 
and it was varied house ... but somethimes i need somethign different ...
oh welll ... perhaps i should have gotten there earlier ...

:)

i LOVED philly!  Just got back last night... i went to HAPPINESS, and i was
truely happy.

Happiness was great. i drove into philly with 12 others (we caravaned in
three cars) and the party was supposed to be in central city Philly, but i
was told that central city parties never happen in Philly and this was no
exception.  The party was supposed to start at 8pm, we got there around 8:30,
found out the location had changed, spent a long time trying to get
directions off the info line, but got the real info off raver-lookin kids
walkin down the street.  The party ended up about an hour outside of philly
at this club (the location was cool, but a little small)

i think the best part about Philly was the people.  I have never met a
friendlier scene!  Everyone was so nice!  The party was very large - when we
got to the location around 10, nothing was set up yet but there was a huge
crowd waiting impatiently outside.  We didn't have tickets, but we had
"reserved" them over the phone, actually we had left a message on the info
line sayin we were coming in from cle and needed to have tickets, and this
guy called us back long distance and told us he'd put us on the guest list.
 So everyone in the group was all worked up in worrying that we weren't going
to get in because the original location was huge and could fit a ton of
people - but they had still sold out. This new location was pint size, and
they were basically sayin if you dont have tickets, leave.  I wasn't worried
though.  I dont know why, but i was totally confident we'd get in, i knew it
would just be  a matter of chattin with the people at the door. So finally
they opened the doors, but would not let people in (only a couple of the DJs
had arrived yet - the whole setting up thing was goin REAL slow) one girl got
in (i met her later, it turned out she was supposed to be there early to help
set up, but she got there late and they just told her to get inside and out
of the mob that was outside the door) and then a couple of us talked to the
door person, then to the guy that had called us, they took our money and let
us in.  hehe.  We were the FIRST people that got into the party.  They even
gave our group one of those special passes (the little cards on a string) to
show we were on the guest list - i felt special :) ) so anyway, getting in
early made me realize how freakin small the place was, i mean it was just a
bar, with a dance floor and a back room with another dance floor.  The place
FILLED.  I heard they let in about 3 times the fire-hazard capacity of the
place, and tons of people climbed in through the windows.  By the time the
place filled it was difficult to move, impossible to find a good spot to
dance.  But i still had a blast.  I met tons of really nice people.  Everyone
was just amazingly friendly and nice.  No one had an attitude.  Even when
people were dancing, you know how people dance with their friends in little
groups and sorta dance around in a little circle, even that was different.  I
would be dancing and all of a sudden i would notice that someone was dancing
with me, we'd get into it and then id have a whole group of complete
strangers dancing with me.  It was all just so friendly.  One thing that was
a little irritating (im sorry, im a perfectionist - i must find fault in
everything) was even though the place was SO crowded, there was at least one
circle in each room, and the real kicker was that there were only a few
really good breakdancers.  Basically someone would just jump into the center
of the circle and  just bop around for a while, then leave the cirlce.  It
was very odd, and the circles were very large and took up all the good space.
 At one point there were three circles in the little room (all at the same
time - one big one and two little ones) and two more in the big room.  I
dunno, that sorta caught my attention.  

The music was good.  DJ Wink, Dub Tribe, Rabbit in the Moon, um, cant
remember the rest right now. But for once i really did try and make a
concious effort to know who was spinning when - it still didnt get me
anywhere, and i was even asking people who were directly invovled with
organizing the party.  Everyone at that party, well, id have to say we were
all lost in the happiness there :) and things like a lineup were a little too
confusing to try and sort out.  I mean djs were late, setting up was chaotic,
so the lineup was a little haphazard.  I was disappointed by Rabbit in the
Moon, not because he wasn't good though, only because he was better in
cleveland.  Dub Tribe was good... there was a lot of good music there, i
think it was the best at the beggining of the party though.  It got more
jungaly as the party progressed, and i just am not a jungle dancer so... I
went to the afterhours, that was great, it was even more friendly and in the
beggining it was happy housy stuff, so i was havin a ball.  Unfortunately
around then, about half of the group i was with (and unfortunately all the
people who had brought cars) suddenly became overwhelmed by their strungout
asses, and found themselves tired, moody and bitchy.  Out of the blue they
all decided they had to leave NOW and IMMEDIATELY.  It was so crazy, i mean
we had planned on continuing on to new york for the party there, and if we
didn't go to that party (it was actually not in NY city) i had made friends
with tons of people from NY and they were tellin me to go to this phat club
party that had a GREAT lineup (dont remember it now - but i remember being
impressed when they told me :) ) and one kid who was a dj in ny or sumthin
gave me his card and told me to call him when i got there and hed help me
out...blah blah blah... i was all set to enjoy myself at the afterhours, take
a little nap (maybe if i felt like it) and then party in NY then mosey on
home.  But no, certain people who i regret ever thinking they were sane
individuals, decided to take off then and there, so without any options (they
wouldn't even give me 20 minutes to run back into the afterhours and find
myself a ride either to ny or back to cle later, i would have been perfectly
willing to just take a greyhound back from ny) but no, we left.  They stopped
an hour later to sleep and eat.  All of us who had actually been into the
afterhours (the tired people never entered the afterhours) well, we were very
much awake and wired.  The three cars all had people sleepin in them, so we
had nothing to do but sit on our asses at this crazy service station, with no
music, no nothin - just waiting around to sit on our asses for 8 more hours
to get home.  ug.  So yeah, the trip home was shitty.  We didn't do a lot of
things right in planning this trip (the biggest error we made was not
planning anything at all) so i guess ill just call it a learning experience.
 But the point of the trip for me was to go to philly and check out the scene
and have a good time.  That i did, so i guess it was a good trip.  

Ill be movin there in the fall and i am SO excited.  The scene is great there
- i luvd the people!  Some of them were tellin me that they really only had
big raves every once and a while - mostly just a lot of club events and such
(um - huh, that sorta sounds EXACTLY like cle :) ) 

But that was my weekend.  People should come visit me in Philly!  Its a great
place - how can you not luv friendly people!  

lots of luv
leah

hahah..yeah, well we get it all the time on B96 here is chicago..i dont
really listen to the radio much here, but i was in best buy while my friend
was shopping for headphones and i heard it on one of the radios, looked
over and saw it was B96---was shocked, but i just started dancing in the
aisle!!!

i guess its not a good or a bad thing, i just think the song is absolutely
beautiful so i guess i am partial for making *everyone* listen to it. :)

I'd say neither. Its just a thing. A thing you'll have to get used to.

It would be nice if they got a credible dance music show going but the
key word is credible.

I heard that too but thought I was just imagining it, guess not :)  It's 
funny to just sit down and watch commercials and see how much of the 
music you'll recognize :)

YES! is that crazy or what?  Ok.  It's not really a jungle song, but its 
got a fast junglistic breakbeat.  If anyone hasn't noticed it yet, it's 
the commercial for Cedar point with the green alien family on it.  I 
think there's another commercial with a jungley soundtrack...it's one for 
the 'hot shows' in June on NBC.  Again, it wasn't exactly a song...just 
sort of a chopped-up bb.  anyway, it's earcatching. ;)

I'v thought about this before.  I'v heard that the station equivalent to 
'the Revolution' in Dallas has a fairly ligit dance show for a couple 
hours a week, where they play stuff at least a step more underground than 
dance mix USA, and I think they've had local DJ's even spin.  
   I would think that a station like 'the revolution',  or whatever 
'alternative music' station is left, would be well advized to come up 
with some sort of at least vaguely good dance show, because not only is 
there lots of good stuff, they definately have a market, which is really 
their only motivation.  
  Has anybody from the local dance scene ever approached any station 
about doing maybe a 2-hour set per week?  I don't think it could hurt to 
try, though I'm sure some people would never want to be associated with 
such a corporate entity.....

just a few thoughts...

This shouldnt be a first :-)  You will hear a good deal of techno
(from IDM to breaks to jungle) on TV a lot if you watch.  Weird.
Certainly someone else has seen the Microsoft commercials with the
Chemical Brothers tracks.  E! Entertainment Television periodically
features techno songs in their commercials (and I mean real stuff...
not put together by the ad agency).  Funny...  A lot of people tell
me that it gives them 'a headache' but apparently marketing research
says the opposite.

saying they are travelling hundreds of miles to partake in the Warm-Up 
Party friday night.
	The 90's will definetely be defined as a period of raving, so 
would you want your children (or grandchildren for you busy people out 
there) in the future to not hear what you had to do with the current 
scene? Be a part of the history being made. Support the scene here in 
North America!

	Please feel free to email me on any queries!!

That Cedar Point commercial may have a fast breakbeat on it, but no, it 
is not Jungle by any means!!

Today on the front page of The Living Arts, New York Times 5/28/96:

          All-Night Parties and a Nod to the '60s -- Rave on

          By NEIL STRAUSS

          [G] OTHAM, Wis. -- The following snippets of
              conversation were overheard on Memorial Day weekend
          at the Eagle Cave and Mountain Campgrounds: "Dudes, my
          last brain cell is already hanging on the edge, and it's
          only Friday -- or Saturday." "Is everyone here a DJ?" "I
          hate brushing my teeth when I'm wasted." "Does anyone
          have some milk or vitamin B12?" "I can't find my car.
          Man, I don't even know if I drove it here."

          While Memorial Day weekend marks the beginning of three
          months of beaches, barbecues and sun for some people,
          for others it is the start of a summer of outdoor raves,
          techno-music dance parties that can last one night or
          several.

          On Friday night at Eagle Cave, rave season officially
          began, with one of the biggest outdoor parties of the
          year: Even Furthur, which drew some 4,000 people to a
          300-acre campground with an onyx cave, a lake and a
          petting zoo.

          For the event, which ended Monday morning, a laser show,
          fireworks, live bands and more than a hundred American
          and European disc jockeys were added to the site, with
          dance music thumping unremittingly, even during the
          scheduled nap time, 8 a.m. to noon.

          When raves started popping up in the United States in
          the early '90s, mixing fast electronic dance music, with
          roots in Detroit, and contemporary British party
          culture, they were exciting, trendy and new.

          Raves were all-night (and -morning) parties at which
          people on the dance floor had the opportunity to be
          themselves, whether that meant playing instruments,
          bringing toys or wearing homemade outfits.

          At the time, the news media covered raves extensively,
          focusing on the music, the fashion, the youth movement
          or the drug-taking (ecstasy, LSD and the animal
          tranquilizer ketamine are common). But soon the
          spotlight moved elsewhere.

          Now, five years later, the rave scene has grown and
          evolved on its own energy, becoming an entrenched
          subculture that exists in a near-vacuum, similar not
          only to the cults that gather around punk-rock or
          Gothic-rock music but also to the Deadheads who followed
          the Grateful Dead.

          With the death of Jerry Garcia and the end of the
          Grateful Dead, raves are becoming the communal gathering
          of choice for Deadheads with nowhere to congregate.

          At Even Furthur, people were decked out in standard rave
          gear -- baggy pants, small backpacks, oversize
          logo-emblazoned T-shirts, floppy hats or baseball caps,
          and pacifiers or lollipops -- but also on display were
          tie-dyed shirts, bandannas and torn, faded jeans.

          Though some Deadheads follow groups like Phish and the
          Allman Brothers Band around the country, rave culture
          seems to have a more entrenched network of dedicated
          travelers, who spend the summer (or longer) in vans,
          chasing raves from city to city trying to see their
          favorite DJs, as opposed to bands.

          (On the rave road map this summer are a camp-out with
          bands like the Orb and Leftfield at Big Bear Lake near
          Los Angeles on the weekend of June 21, One-der in
          Minneapolis and Fantasia 2 at Randalls Island in New
          York City, both on July 6.)

          Deadheads and ravers actually have a lot in common. The
          music and the uniforms may be different, but both groups
          are rooted in the '60s subculture of tuning in, turning
          on and dropping out. In fact, the Wisconsin rave's oddly
          spelled name, Furthur, comes from the word printed on
          the front of the bus Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters
          drove around in the '60s.

          Coincidentally, when the former members of the Grateful
          Dead tour together with their own bands this summer,
          they will be calling the event the Furthur Festival,
          inspired by the same bus-sign declaration of pressing
          forward on the road and in the expansion of
          consciousness.

          Though raves certainly have more relevance than Grateful
          Dead shows to '90s culture (with themes of speed,
          technology, synthetics and the dismantling of
          individuality), they are becoming less relevant.

          The rave scene, like the Deadhead scene, is turning into
          an autonomous, self-referential and self-perpetuating
          culture with little desire to effect change in the
          outside world -- just to escape it for a little while.
          This was borne out by the location of Even Furthur,
          which was a three-to-five-hour drive from the nearest
          major cities (Chicago, Milwaukee and Minneapolis).

          For four days an alternative community was built. The
          ravers, who ranged in age from 12 to a few stragglers in
          their 30s, slept in tents, recreational vehicles and
          cars. Some people rented trucks, in the back of which
          they set up their own sound systems and added to the
          filigree of dance beats stretching over the campground
          valley.

          It rained every day; nonetheless, ravers danced in muddy
          tents to their favorite DJs (Frankie Bones, ESP Woody
          McBride, Scott Hardkiss, Apollo, Mixmaster Morris),
          marveled at how well electronics whizzes like Daft Punk
          and Laura Grabb could perform the music on live
          instruments and discovered that rock bands like Low and
          Poi Dog Pondering could also fit into a rave.

          Though raves can get a little more cliquish,
          fashion-conscious and musically snobbish than a Grateful
          Dead concert, each night the crowd at Even Furthur grew
          more generous and cohesive. Individuals' campfires
          became public shelters, where people could warm up, meet
          fellow travelers and talk, away from the din of the
          music.

          Some of the younger ravers who come from troubled homes
          described the community as a substitute family; others,
          from small towns where being a raver means being an
          outcast, said the parties were the only opportunities
          they had to meet and talk to people with similar
          interests and mind-sets.

          (There was only one arrest over the weekend, of a boy
          who was having a violent reaction to a psychedelic drug,
          smashing car windows and screaming that he was dead.)

          Like the crowds at Grateful Dead parking lots, ravers
          even formed a few drum circles. As different as techno's
          pile-driver boogie and the Dead's brand of jam-rock are,
          they both place importance on complex rhythms and the
          primitive, spiritual force of percussion.

          Several Deadhead ravers (call them Deadbeats) said that
          it wasn't a stretch to like techno music, since the
          long, experimental "space" and "drums" improvisations
          that were a staple of every Dead show are similar in
          sound and hypnagogic intent.

          The future of raves is ambiguous. They are certainly now
          as entrenched as any other music-based youth subculture,
          but with more and more Deadheads and curious sybarites
          popping up at the parties, they are slowly expanding.

          The promoters of Even Furthur see potential for the
          rave's grand entrance into the mainstream in children
          born since 1989, the first generation since the baby
          boomers to have an annual birth rate of more than 4
          million. If these children's parents and grandparents
          all listen to rock 'n' roll, one promoter from Chicago
          explained, they'll need to rebel and find a music of
          their own.

          That, he hopes, will be the electronic pulse of rave
          music, whatever it will have evolved into by the time
          these children are old enough to stay out (or sneak out)
          all night.

Well around the time of Boom I know that UnDerGround Inc was approached 
by people from 104.7 the Revolution. They wanted to do just such a showin 
exchange for UDG hanging a Revolution banner. Not sure what happened but 
I do know that John was looking more at WAMO to do such a show as it 
would have fit in better with their format. 104.7 *is* a rock station 
after all.

Now 6 months ago I would have put the odds of such a show on WAMO at 
about 15% but in light of all the changes going on over there I think it 
would have to at least be %50.

Imagine getting to hear the UDG DJ's, (Ruffian, dieselBoy, Sine, Supa-C, 
Smoov) on WAMO. Who know's. It could happen.

It may not be much- but I spin jungle each every week on wrct 88.3,
friday nights at midnight.  During the school year, i tag team with a
kid who does house.
Just thought I'd drop that tid bit on your ass....  tune in sometime (i
also try to mix it up with some dancehall, jazz breaks, and hip hop)....
also, i know the first class cru (farmer tea representing) keeps it live
for the upitt massive and beyond.
-pc

ps you may or may not have noticed, but rct has a wider listening area
than wamo since wamo moved up the dial...

That song must have made it onto the Musac tapes that restraunts/bars use,
because its been playing at some cheesy restraunts out here in CA like
Acapulco's, Tony Roma's, etc.

I laughed out loud the first time i heard it.

I'm gonna write:

Sup, Geoff.  :)
Hmm.  I've never really thought about making legit dance a reality on 
commercial radio.  (I have NO faith in it.)  But with all the switchups 
happneing with WAMO and that new jazz station, it could be a 
possibility.  I'm not sure who it would be harder to sell it to:  the X 
(since the rev is dead, right?) or a station with a "blacker" approach.  
apparently the Revulsion asked UDG if they wanted to advertise...that's a 
decent sign.  but if you could sell a housier approach to a WAMO type 
setup, that would work too.

but guys, what about WYEP???  I think they still run that (sometimes) 
lame-ass show Echoes (with John Di Laberto...).  Why not dance?  From 
what I gather, they're pretty open to ideas until they think of one that 
will get them more pledge money.  Their audience is pretty much upper 
middle class liberals, not quite as gritty as the dance scene, but it's 
still possible, esp if you sell it as like a cultural phenomenon.  Throw 
in some ancient reggae, some inocuous 80s rap, and bam. Kulchah.  And I'm 
sure tons of us on here have connections there.  I can think of 3 
or 4 off the top of my head.

btw, pitt students, if you wanna get nvolved with the campus radio 
station, GET IN TOUCH WITH ME.  I can opefully/possibly push you through 
the paperwork if you're not an ax murderer or B94 listener.  

Especially if you got accepted into a training class (that means you went 
to the big meeting, then had an interview, then found out you were 
accepted and nothing else happened) but then suddenly 
felt left out in the cold.  That happens a lot since the directors are 
all students and very busy.

re techno/jungle/etc on TV...

Yeah, I kinda stared at the screen funkily when I saw that Cedar Point 
commercial...no one else in the room knew what the hell I was scrinching 
my nose at.

Ok, has anyone seen that goofy ass comercial for Clinoril or Clariton or 
wahtever the name of the drug is?  I saw an ad for it in a medical 
hjournal once and thought it would make a great rave flier.  then I saw 
the commercial on TV (at least a year later) and saw that the whole 
commercial was kinda lucid and bright and trippy with like happy 
ambient/trancey something in the background.  It's that commercial for 
like an antihistemine I think and it's all bright and fluorescent with 
this woman's face hanging over it like a good omen.  It has to have been 
done by a raver or ex-raver.  IMHO.

I'm a newbie here on this list, but not to pittsburgh raves
I'm an inspiring young electronic muscian without money and equipment;
frustrated of course,
However  I believe the more I expose myself to the rave scene, the more
integrated and multifaceted my stlye will be.  In other words, I can't wait
to get a friggin sampler!!! (I never really say that f-word).
        Meanwhile, though, I have this homepage with nothing important to
do with it:
                                fresh--------->http://cac.psu.edu/~pss116
        until now.
        my page this summer is dedicated to keep you informed with flyer
info on pittsburgh raves. I haven't seen any new ohio flyers so If any one
can help me out here, maybe send me flyer info and I will definately put it
online. I would greatly appreciiate any information donation, suggestions,
complaints (not really), criticism, feedback, etc...

Right now I have three flyers online, all in Pittsburgh:
        The Phanny Dance   May 31, 1996
        Togetherness            June  8, 1996
        Get Busy                  June 15, 1996

p.s. I had so much fun at Superfly giving and recieving backrubs all night!!

Just doing my part--
keepin it alive in 96  (it just doesn't sound as cool as last year, for
some odd reason)

p.p.s. did anyone hear a jungle remix of Deee-lite's "Call Me"?? I did. It
was phat. Too bad I forget where I heard it.

alright..the moment you all have been waiting for: what was kate's first
camp-out party like? hah.. just kidding.

well, we ended up getting there really early saturday morning--(and
amazingly right as we got there we ran into stuff and erie!!), we got there
when it was dark, and by the time we got all the tents set up, it was light
out. by that time, i had so much energy pent up in me for being up for so
long, i was ready to dance!!! so nancy and i took off down the hill to
dance in the morning :) terry mullan in the morning, it was okay..but i got
tired after a bit, and went up to the tent.

 i slept for about an hour when i woke up in a completely surreal
state---it was pouring, i was freezing and wet b/c water had seeped into
the tent, and outside some kid named josh was completely freaking out
screaming "oh my god! oh my god! oh shit! oh fuck! we're going to die!
no-you dont understand!" it was very freaky b/c i had only slept for an
hour, i had no idea where i was, and i was all wet. but apparently it was
worse for raygundan and his campingmates, cuz the kid was circling his
tent. this was a freaky experience not b.c the kid was freaking out (well
that too) but b/c all these people around the tent were screaming at him to
shut up and mocking him..it was really sad. way to be compassionate, kids.
;/ plus they were suggesting to knock him out or something, and that would
be really smart, a bunch of fucked up kids hitting someone in the head to
knock him out. some people were trying to get  him niacin, i dont know what
eventually happened, but he finally stopped after a long long time (i guess
he had been this way for two days). so anyways, after that i was ready to
explore...

THE SPACE
eagle cave campgrounds.
the space was split into two levels: the upper level had car camping and
little systems, running water, food, bathrooms, showers, level ground.  the
lower level had the main tent, the dbn side tent, the freebass tent, a few
other tents scattered, and tons of ravers camping on a huge slant. (one
word of advice, never park your tent opened upward on a hill when its
slated to rain) there was no running water on the lower level. that sucked,
especially since my water bottle kept getting lost/stolen. the only other
thing that sucked was the inconsistency of the shuttle running. oh yeah and
there was a "serious fucking problem" with the way that people were parked
so "asininely", so everyone ended up having to move their cars or get them
towed. this was making me laugh, even though it was no laughing matter. the
two areas were like completely different worlds, but it was pretty cool,
although i would have liked everyone to be in the same general vicinity.

THE MUSIC/SOUND/LIGHTS

kikoman and miles outta a camper with a loud system---woowooo!! that was
the first time i had heard miles, and he played a lot of recrods that i
really really liiked while i was sitting in the car.

the only two smaller tents that i frequented were the dynamic groove tent
and the freebass tent.
dynamic groove--caught an awesome set of huggie(*wide open mouth, eyes
huge*) and (stevenkaye??) tagteaming--i am probably wrong. nick kick was
*Really* good. snuggles and slak ...awwwyeah (prepped me for phantom45),
gill had a nice morning set for me to wake up to, and i only heard a little
of dave siska's...thanks to dynamic groove, they really did a good job!

there was a lot of good stuff going on in the freebass tent as well. i
caught dan efex's set as i was taking down the tent--i ran down the hill
for his last track??can anyone id that one? (ahhhhhhhhh!!) and markeD's set
was _really_ good, he packed in an afternoon crowd, and mixmaster morris
spun some *funky* shit..how do you describe that? it was best described to
me as jungle-ambient-jazz...very nice..thanks to freebass as well.


the lights in the main tent were okay..i thought that the visuals led much
to be desired--the ones being projected on the screen--who exactly was that
man with the dark hair that they kept showing?? but the lasers outside,
wow. and sometime after daft punk, the lights kept blinking right into my
eyes, they must have chagned the programming or soemthing b/c i had to
dance with my eyes shut cuz i kept getting blinded. |)

contrary to what the flier said, Maxximum did NOT do the sound, Badger did,
and honestly, to quote one of my friends "it did not do the music justice."
when i first went down to dance on saturday night, i was having a sucky
time. i lost my flashlight, and i went up to the front to dance by the
speakers which i usually do. unfortunately, the bass bins were taller than
i am, and i couldnt hear any midrange or high stuff..and the bass was _not_
clean. this didnt make me happy. it really sucked up there. plus, i couldnt
see the dj at all, i didnt catch a glimpse of one dj all night.(and i hate
that too--for some reason i like to see whats technically going on) so i
decided to move to the center-left of the room. the sound was slightly
better there.

davey dave---house, everyone was loving it. i wasnt having a good time, the
sound was sucky--whatever.

mystic bill--everyone loves him too, i thought he was okay, i was still
having a shitty time even when he played this song that has an absolutely
FABULOUS intro, and then it breaks into some heavy-sounded woman with a
deep luxurious voice singing something about "keeping on moving" or
something like that (anyone know the track? so far i know he played it at
outburst and at EF) --well anyways he DID NOT play the intro!!! what is
wrong with that?? if you ppl could hear this intro, you would go
crazeeEEEee like i did when i heard it and know why i let out a sigh of
disappointment everytime i hear the lyrics kick in (i think they kinda ruin
it, but i am getting used to it). anyways, inthe middle of his set, i felt
like getting outta there, so i left. adn wandered around the mud until i
ran into nancy/erie and jocelyn..at which point my night took a drastic
turnaround....nancy and i went to the back of the room

phantom45---oh my god. talk to paul/slak about it. he played the
whining/whimpering dog song!!!! this was the first time that i have ever
lost my shit dancing to jungle!! it was awesome :)

ESP Woody McBRide----excellent...wooowooo!!! i was *still* losing my shit!
and by then gill and i had found eachother, and nancy and i were dancing,
and it was *really* fun! the only sucky part was that i could not find
water ANYwhere!! i had to go back up to my tent to get a huge thing that i
had left up there. that sucked. people need water.

then, they had the burnign man ceremony thing, but i didnt go, i stayed in
the tent area waiting for...

daft punk live---everyone was GOING NUTS!!! he was really good. he played
the  song(i think it was the flipside of the roulette record, the one that
goes "i-i-i-idont-idontknowwhy-etc)  with a kinda breaky styles
...ohmigod!!! ...we were absolutely going crazy. i was still dancing! those
build ups were.....ahhhhhh!!! unbelievable!!

frankie bones--i had gone outside to take a little rest, but danced for
some of it too.

laura grabb--again, very very good. i danced my ass off again! after her
was deadly buda, and it was too hard for me, so i danced a little of it,
and waited for kikoman, who i thought was going to play nicer housier
stuff, but didnt--it was hard tooo..(i was reminded that i was in wisconsin
;) by then i didnt feel like waiting around for astroboy, so gill and i
trekked up the hill and slept in the car cuz we didnt want to be cold and
wet :)

the next day seemed kinda weird. everyone seemed really lost and a lot of
ppl had already left, leaving the place a little bit muddy and big spaces
of grass where tents had been. but still, i had fun. i took down the tent
by myuself whcih was nice, b/c it gave me time to reflect on the weekend. i
had a really good weekend, despite the rain and despite trudging up that
freakin hill!

sunday was a nice day for wandering: caught sets that i have already
mentioned (gill/dave/marke)---what was with all the gabber upstairs?? and
then we went downstairs and heard the *same set* on the system next to the
dbn tent..that was weird, but it made for soem funny jokes. ;) some nice
nice jungle coming from that same system while i was packing up...jungle
and efex, simultaneously...ahhhhh :)


some other highlights/sucky things:

music EVERYwhere!! it was just....wonderful. beats thumping all the
time...i dont get enough of this in my dorm room! ;)

the kids who set up a campfire on the side of walking up the winding road
and had stuck fliers to the rocks, and were just hanging there..that was
cool.

too many drugs. it seemed like everyone was fucked outta their minds. i
tend to think that the drugs should be a part of the experience, not the
entire experience. every other second it seemed like some stupid person was
asking me to buy everything but drano.

the jungle bros getting their money's worth during phantom45 ;)

whoever had that huge disco ball suspended above their camper---YOU ROCK

dancing with Nancy/erie!!!!! woooowoooo :)

the firecrackers next to the lake were awesome! woooowooooo!!!

friendly friendly people who were ALL DIRTY !!! =]

innovative camping ideas; funny theme tents, hanging clotheslines

the trampolines!!!!!! BoOOoOOoInG!

mmmmmmm...portopotties.

kids in pimped out U-Hauls---aww yeah, pulling it comfort-stylies

interviewing JJ

we all missed mr muppetfucker,  noah :~(

can anyone confirm the rumor that ritchie hawtin spun a five hour set in
the racine tent on sunday sometime??

i'm sorry that i keep missing hardkiss--but what the hey, there will alwyas
be another time sooner or later.

oh and---whatever happened to the garbage bags that were going to be
dispersed to each car at the door?? the place was a disaster afterward, and
it only takes five minutes to pick up all the shit and bottles around the
tents.

getting to meet a TON of new people, netravers that i have corresponded
with, and never known--being able to instantly PICK out indydave, and the
netbadges were just AWESOME!!! thanks to star smack and jong(ya tried)!!!!!

if you did not receive your netbadge, email me, i have a bunch here that
ppl never got. sorry i missed the netmeet--i was wandering without a
flashlight.

thank you for a really fun weekend guys, it took a lot of the stress that
had been building up from school off of me. (and i guess no vrave for two
weeks can do that too ;) i think that is what made me dance so hard all
weekend without barely getting tired (and not even being tired when i got
back)

alright i think that is it...thanks if you made it through this long-ass post...

thank you to everyone who made this party possible, and i hope i get to
party with you guys all this summer, (if i am allowed too ;)

love and stuff

kate O+

Ok, because my brain doesn't always work, it seems I've recently ended
up with four blank tapes, which were given to me within the past 10
days.  However, out of those four, I only know to whom three of them
belong... 

Dan Freelove gave me a sony hf type 1 90 min. tape (wrapped)
Proby gave me a Maxell normal bias UR 90 min. tape (wrapped)
Ryu gave me a Maxell high bias XL II  90 min. tape (wrapped)

that leaves one mysterious blank tape... If you gave me this tape
PLEASE get in touch with me ASAP, because I need to know who to give
it back to.  If the tape is yours, send me a description of it (for
verification purposes ;) and your mailing address

I also sent out mixtapes to those who sent me postage and tapes etc. 

If you want a tape, I'll post this info again later... :)

ok coool :)

Precedence: bulk

at 1st i responded privately to kate concerning her paper topic,
but after much time & effort, i thought it would be best if i 
shared this w/ all of you...

kate sed:
=================================================================  
the purpose of my paper is to show the trend or the change in raves that
have happened as a result of the growth and "mainstreamization" of raves in
america over the past (about) five years. I want to focus on the technical
aspect of parties as well as the personal experiences.

what I am trying to prove is that in the beginning, raves were small,
closely knit, spontaneous parties, often times when people would break into
an abandoned warehouse, set up a make-shift sound system, and party. Today,
raves are far more legal, and are "businesses" so to speak. What I would
like to know is how you perceive raves to have changed.  One of my main
points is to prove that media exposure made the general public more aware
of raves, and because of this, more people began going to raves, more money
was involved, and legal issues began to appear. Because there were more
people, venues had to be larger, more secure, and safer. This has led to a
change in parties.

i especially would like to have some personal anecdotes..

                                                                                
for instance, what was your first party like in terms of what parties today
are like?
===================================================================

the first parties i attended were much more underground than the
raves of today. they utilized map points, which have become almost
obsolete nowadaze. other differences w/ old skool raves & modern raves:
  
o the modern raves are way more expensive nowadaze. raves today cost
  like $20 to get in when it used to be half that or less on the 
  average.
o the modern rave flyers are huge multicolored w/ extravagant computer
  graphics. old skool flyers were cheezy usually some name brand rip
  off like Tidal Rave patterned after a Tide Box & were small about
  half page sized. some were even kinko copied.
o the crowd has completely changed. old skool ravers wore stocking
  caps. t-shirts w/ cheesy designs usually ravey name brand rip-offs
  like US RAVE TEAM patterned after the US SKI TEAM logo. nobody
  wore baggy pants back in the day. colored doc martins were the 
  old skool footwear. the dress wuz clubier becuz dats where most
  of the crowd came from. the prefered drug wuz acid. the ravers of
  today sport a combination gangsta athletic gear meets non-conformist
  skater rag. baggy is the way to go. the phatter the cooler. stocking
  caps have been replaced by visors & kangol caps. the cheesy t-shirts
  have been replaced by soccer shirts. the prefered footwear has become
  the latest adidas or nike air running shoes. the prefered drug is
  ecstacy.
o the old skool sound wuz house. acid house. and old skool techno.
  hardcore techno. the new skool sound is detroit minimal techno. 
  chicago hard house. midwest hardcore. east coast slo-breaks.
  west coast trance. and pittsburgh jungle. the music has split off.

=======================================================================
if you have been involved with raves for a long time, how did you find out
about raves,  or if you are newer to the scene, how did you get involved
with it? [i am going to attempt to show that the way that people find out
about raves have changed through the years due to media exposure]
======================================================================== 

i 1st found out about raves thru a friend from germany who kinda
introduced me to techno, altho i wuz already into industrial and
alternative music at the time. his name wuz lars fisher. techno
& raves were already really big in germany at the time & he wuz 
surprised America still hadn't caught on. he wuz also my partner
on college radio. at the time a 'rave' hadn't even been thrown
in cleveland yet. so both myself & lars planned on throwing the
1st rave in cleveland on 3/22/92 (two days after my 22nd B-day)
along w/ a few other local college radio dj's: steven st. james
(wruw), marla (wruw), sam (wruw) and mike filly (wujc) and rob
bertrand (wujc). we were the only ones spinning techno on the
air in cleveland at the time. welp campus authorities found out
about the party a few days before the party wuz s'posed to go off.
so the first rave idea got squashed. later on one of the college
radio dj's that wuz s'posed to spin at my party teamed up w/ a  
local club dj - rob sherwood (smart bar) to throw the 1st official
rave in cleveland - Tidal Rave on 6/92. after witnessing how
non-profitable rave production wuz (thru the losses of rob & mike,
kevin bumpers, jimmy allen, mel-ske dredd, alex & sooper wack) i
decided to stay out of the party throwing biz & did what i did 
best by promoting the scene by promoting partys on the air,        
letting techno dj's spin on my show, giving away free passes to
the Smart Bar, getting kids into the scene basically.

===================================================================
 Who are you and what has been your position or role in parties been today
and in the past? (i.e. what do you do ? dj, promoter, tech, attendent,
whatever, etc..)
=================================================================== 

later on i started the cwru rave team. sort of an underground rave
organization for the case campus. and when interest grew off
campus, it became Pretty Little Rave Machine (the name wuz inspired
by a dancer by the name of lisa lee who i had seen throwing down at
a party out east). when members graduated i started PLRM as sort of
a newsletter to keep everybody updated. PLRM soon became open to all
ravers that were interested in the north east ohio area. and when i
joined ne-raves, pb-cle-raves, & mw-raves, i had writers from as 
far east as NYC. as far west as larkspur, california. as far north 
as montreal canada and as far south as tallahasee, florida. the
magazine grew at an incredible rate. one major turning point for the
magazine was when four girls passed from columbus. at the time i wuz
uncertain whether i would continue doing the magazine or not mostly
becuz i wuz losing so much money from putting the magazine out
w/ mostly my own money & giving it out for free. but i promised i
would continue the magazine for them as long as i financially could.
from that point PLRM became peace love rave magazine & took on a more
serious note w/ interviews from the likes of brian from UPS, carlos
from san fran, lonnie from ultraworld, joe 187, JJ, Chinagrrrl, Chip
from Eyegasm, Tom from orbitrecords, etc. i began my own spiritual
journey & like the celestine prophecy, i met many important people mostly
by chance & shared their insights w/ all my readers. by the end of it
all i realized that i had done all i could and have had some positive
influence in our li'l scene by opening up several important points of
views and raising some consciousness. i believe my little magazine has
either directly or indirectly helped raise the level of the scene just a    
little bit to its next step of evolution - ravers that are more musically,
spiritually, as well as physically intelligent. and i thank God for this.
i also thank god for the countless many souls that i have come in contact
w/ thru out my journey that have had some positive influence in my life
& hopefully i have had some positive influence w/ them. i like to refer
to these enlightened souls as 'the family of light'. since they have
become my family away from my family and they have brought light into
my life & hopefully i have brought some light into theirs. 

i have since retired from doing the magazine. handing it over to three
highly spirited individuals: star, kate, & jay. little did i realize 
when i 1st introduced star to kate via cyberspace that this dynamic
duo would keep the faith. i have also since been trying to retire from
the scene, but alas somebody keeps pulling me back in it. so i've been
making cameo's on special occasions. i have retired from ne-raves, but
still participate on mw-raves and pb-cle-raves. i still do what i do
best - connecting people together since i know so many people from
all over from raving & promoting w/ my voice-mail line & via word of
mouth (stevie t still one of the most out-spoken rave promotors in 
cleveland). but now i like to spend most of my free time w/ my new
found love - crysta - the light at the end of the tunnel. and i can
not thank God enuff for her. becuz she like a few of the 'more special'
people in the family of light wuz lucky to be alive - she lived thru  
her car accident.

==========================================================================
How has the structure and organization of raves changed since underground
parties in america first started appearing ?
==========================================================================

the raves of today are alot more organized & legal. renegade partys
have been replaced w/ legal venues w/ all the permits signed. partys
are less spontaneous and planned out months ahead of time. contracts
are signed & down payments are made nowadaze. the cost of a party
has gone way up w/ partys hitting in excess of the $50,000 range.
when $10,000 wuz already mind blowing back in the day. more &
more security are appearing at partys to ensure the safety of the
party people. security wuz unheard of back in the day. also back in
the day raves could be planned a month ahead. now raves are planned
atleast three months ahead. instead of breaking into some place &
setting up yur sound system there & throwing a party thru mostly
word of mouth. nowadaze u gotta secure yur venue, get all yur permits.
put down payments on sound & lights. book yur dj's & send out down
payments w/ them. hire security. hire a professional printing company to
print your flyers. ship all yur flyers to promotors all over yur
region. and travel to other partys to promote yur party.

============================================================================
Do you think that media exposure has affected the rave scene by
simultaneously forcing some raves or parties furthur undeground (smaller
parties) while at the same time forcing another segment aboveground, to
encompass many many more people?
=============================================================================

i think the media has had very little effect on raves. i mean let's
face it how many people do u think actually watch 'hard copy'. now
how many people that watched it do u think has any power to do any
thing about it that don't like raves. the only incident that i can
think of where the media has had some effect wuz the bad media
coverage of Tunnelvision in pittsburgh. but then later on so many
ravers called the governor about it that the tides turned & raves
were viewed positively. the governor even allowed a party to be
thrown in the science center. the only thing that can stop raves
is the government. and believe u me, if they really wanted to stop 
'em, they could do it very easily. but y'see like w/ everything,
the government is getting its cut - whether we realize it or not.

==============================================================================
what kind of permits, security, and other business issues are necessary to
deal with in order to have an event today?
==============================================================================

i believe u need a fire marshal to sign a safety permit. a dance
permit signed by the governor. a contract signed w/ the owner of
the space. u need vendor permits for yur vendor, selling tickets
at the door also recquires a vending permit. alcohol permit if u
plan on selling alcohol. u have to hire security, first aid, &
clean up crews. i also believe some of the more major productions
also have to pay an entertainment tax. i recall lonnie mentioning
this. yup unless u wanna end up like al pacino, u hafta pay yur
taxes.

===============================================================================
Do you have to be more careful about insurance and security? Is it often
that someone gets hurt at a party?
===============================================================================

few promotors have selected to buy incident insurance where if
anyone ever dies at one of their events they are insured up to
a couple hundred thousand dollars. i believe the promotors of LSD wuz 
lucky that they invested in this especially since there were 35 OD's at 
that party. Phat-O also invests in this as well as i believe JJ. 
incidents are very rare at partys. u'll get the occassional 'bad tripper',
but death has been very rare at partys atleast in the midwest.

================================================================================
One way that raves have changed has been in the terms of ticket sales.
Today, for many parties, it is possible to buy your tickets at
ticketmaster, and I have heard of people (I dont know where) paying for
their tickets on credit cards. Has the growth of raves made parties into a
commercial business when they were once nothing more than spontaneous
get-togethers with music and a renegade space?
================================================================================

yes rave tickets are sold thru ticketmaster in canada. and yes i
have charged my tickets on a credit card before going to a pleasure
force party in toronto, canada. and yes raves are definitely becoming
commercial businesses. i believe most of the major production companys
not only pay their entertainment tax but also are licensed as private 
businesses. and let's not forget some major investors that have 
sponsored raves: camel, marlboro, pepsi, mountain dew, etc. record
lables that put out techno sponsor raves all the time. especially in
detroit, chicago, LA, & NYC.

================================================================================
Has the media exposure and the growth of raves led to more police awareness
of parties b/c of raves have been portrayed as dangerous and threatening?
================================================================================

i think the ironic think is altho the local police are pretty clueless,
the secret services are plenty in the know. they have all the info #'s,
they check all the rave calendars on the internet, they've got undercover
agents at partys - they know what's up - they just aren't doing anything
becuz the government is getting it's cut. the SS knew about MOSAIC - the
NE-Rave Cybertribe party - prolly one of the most underground partys
thrown this year - it wuz only promoted thru  the ne-rave internet
community & they still knew about it. the locals only stop by if they
hear too much noise & usually don't do too much if there's no trouble or
if they're paid enuff bribe money (as in spawntaneous's case).

the bottom line is this. we may think we're getting away w/ alot when 
we're attending raves, but in reality, the government knows. they just
don't care cuz they're getting it's cut one way or another. if u don't
realize this than yur living in a fantasy world. but then again raves
are a fantasy world. it just takes some longer to figure it out. people
won't do anything unless there's money involved. that's the way this
country is run. and until we figure out a way out of this capitalistic
society, then that's the way things will continue to be w/ people getting
greedier & greedier w/ the rich getting richer & the poor getting poorer.
...until the poor will out number the rich. and that's when the revolution
will start. but hopefully the underground will remember it's fore-fathers
and what they taught them about peace, about love, about unity, and about
respect.

peace, love, unity, and respect to the family of light.

i'm not a gangsta, i just play one on tv. hmm me thinx me meant
al capone here. don't know what i wuz thinkin - stevie t watchin
too much tv!

BTW this blurb is soley pertaining to the cleveland rave scene.
obviously scenes vary from city to city. but since the media has
yet to destroy the scene here (mainly due to a few very positive
promotors that work w/ the law & individuals that portray the
scene thru a positive medium - ie PLRM), they can not be blamed
here. however this may not be the case for other cities, specifically:
detroit, chicago, LA, and New York where media coverage has gotten
so biased that partys are constantly being shut down there.

   When Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters boarded the Magic Bus some 30 years
 
ago -- destination marked "Furthur" -- who could have anticipated they would
end
up in a campground in southeastern Wisconsin, tripping out to electronic 
music 
programmed by deejays from Britain and Chicago?                               
 
                                                                              
 
                                                                              
 
                        
 Chicago Tribune, May 24, 1996                          
                                                                              
 
   Chances are Kesey and the Pranksters won't be at the Even Furthur  techno  
 
campout this weekend, but the festival comes closer than most to capturing the
 
original essence of the Magic Bus crew. Whereas the HORDE tour of post-hippie 
 
jamming bands, and the similarly named Furthur festival of Grateful Dead
spinoff
projects, will be playing the rather antiseptic confines of North America's   
 
amphitheaters this summer, the third annual Even Furthur fest is a            
 
back-to-nature weekend: three nights and four days of virtually nonstop 
music. 
                                                                              
 
   "There might be a couple of down hours," muses one of the festival's three 
 
organizers, David Prince of Chicago. "And there might not. I know I'm not
going 
to sleep."                                                                    
 
                                                                              
 
   Prince has been known to push the envelope on a number of levels, most     
 
notably when he danced naked atop a set of speakers during a set by legendary 
 
U.K. deejay the Aphex Twin during the first Furthur festival, in 1994. Prince,
 
who publishes a  techno  fanzine out of Chicago called Reactor and is
co-writing
a book with Timothy Leary, says not to expect an encore this year: "It's      
 
entertaining if you get naked once; more than once it becomes kind of creepy."
 
                                                                              
 
   What can be expected is an exceptional lineup of electronic  music         
 
programmed by deejays Mixmaster Morris, Frankie Bones, Scott Hardkiss, Daft
Punk
and Boo Williams, among others. In addition, there will be live performances  
 
                         Chicago Tribune, May 24, 1996                        
 
                                                                              
 
by rock bands such as Low and Poi Energy Inc., an electro-rock offshoot of    
 
Chicago's Poi Dog Pondering.                                                  
 
                                                                              
 
   Because of such exceptional lineups, the Even Furthur festival and its     
 
organizers -- Prince, Milwaukee deejay Kurt Eckes (a k a DJ Jethrox) and      
 
Minneapolis deejay Woody McBride (a k a DJ ESP) -- have won an international  
 
reputation.  Raves,  ubiquitous in Western Europe, are gaining in popularity
in 
North America, but no one in the States has attempted a festival as           
 
logistically, geographically or artistically challenging as Even Furthur, let 
 
alone for three straight years.                                               
 
                                                                              
 
   "We basically got tired of throwing  raves  in dark, dirty warehouses,"    
 
Prince says. "We wanted to hear this  music  outside, to take it even further,
 
as they say. We were inspired by the British  raves  and 'The Electric
Kool-Aid 
Acid Test,' " Tom Wolfe's classic account of life with the Merry Pranksters in
 
the mid-'60s.                                                                 
 
                                                                              
 
   Although previous Even Furthur events, also in rural Wisconsin, suffered
from
noise complaints and run-ins with authorities unused to having several
thousand 
young people partying nonstop for three days to speaker-quaking electronic    
 
 music,  Prince says this year's fully licensed  rave  promises to be
relatively
trouble-free.                                                                 
 
                         Chicago Tribune, May 24, 1996                        
 
                                                                              
 
   Would-be ravers are asked to call one of three numbers for directions to
the 
festival, which begins Friday night and concludes Monday afternoon:           
 
312-509-6334, 414-256-1733 or 612-649-4741. The festival's site was kept
secret 
until Thursday to prevent people from showing up at the campground several
days 
early.                                                                        
 
                                                                              
 
   - A more pronounced  dance  vibe has been creeping into Poi Dog Pondering's
 
albums since 1992's "Volo Volo," and the group takes the impulse all the way  
 
into the nether regions of the club underground with the recent self-released
EP
"Electrique Plummagram" (Platetectonic). It contains remixes of several of the
 
band's songs, plus a cover of Frankie Knuckles' "Hard Sometimes," which Poi
has 
been performing in concert for several years.                                 
 
                                                                              
 
   "Some people have been horrified," leader Frank Orrall says with a laugh,  
 
referring to some of the band's longtime fans, who started grumbling about
some 
of the club-oriented grooves that appeared on the 1995 Poi album
"Pomegranate."

   Orrall has never considered Poi simply a rock band, and its open-ended     
 
quality has left some of the group's earlier, genre-obsessed fans bewildered.

   Orrall is looking forward to Poi's appearance at this weekend's  rave,  in 
 
its Poi Energy Inc. incarnation, with programmed rhythms underpinning singers 
 
and keyboardists.

With all due respect, I don't share the same confidence that you do
regarding the Cleveland media.  The fact is, these straights really have
no idea what a "rave" is yet.  When they do . . . and eventually they will
. .  . all hell will break loose as with every other city.  Steve, just
think about how they're doing these sensationalist scare reports on the
germs in drinking fountains and what horrible things might happen to your
child when you drop him/her off at a day care center. If they consider
this to be quality investigative reporting, imagine what they'll do with a
story involving teenagers and illicit drug usage in unregulated venues.
It's a layup.  Let's just hope that the WKYC's and WEWS's of the world
don't have any producers in the know.  They certainly won't get it from
this list -- after all, they're just beginning to figure out what the
internet it.  :)

lets see... i was doing some planning for the upcoming weekends'
raving activities, and was trying to find the best choices.  I noticed
the following interesting pattern...

(not mentioning ANY names)
(all prices are ADVANCED tickets)

an upcoming nyc party:  

2 live acts and 16 dj's, 2 rooms, lights, lasers, vis, sound

price? $22

an upsoming baltimore party: 

16 dj's 3 "rooms" (its outside) lights, sound

price? $20

an upcoming richmond party:

11 dj's 2 rooms, lights, sound

price? $13

another bmore party:

9 dj's 2 rooms lights sound

price? $12

heres the real kicker...

an upcoming pittsburgh party:

6 dj's (HUH!?) one room, lights sound

price? $18



!?!?!?!?!? WHAT!? can we say comparison shopping kids!? 

Well, first of all, I don't wanna point any fingers or give anybody a
bad name or anything, but REALLY, whats up with that mondo price tag?
Is it gonna be held in a diamond mine or something!? 

ok, so now, everybody will say, hey, you don't wanna go, DON'T GO.
well, I'm not gonna. BUT I'm also not about to sit on my ass and let
people get taken for a ride.  figure it out. 

Does this mean that I can start charging $10 for a mixtape? (that cost
me $3 to make?) 

Flame on! :) :)

something is wrong here.  if i'm thinking of the same event, it is being done
in cooperation with -----------inc.   i think INCORPERATED might be the 
important word here.  what's up guys?  can't pay your venue bills?  not enuff
money to book all them awesome out of town dj's?  well, the flier for this 
event must have set you back a bit...right?  no?  then what's up!
this party didn't even make it to the rom, so it must not be a large scale time.
this is a bad thing.

>Does this mean that I can start charging $10 for a mixtape? (that cost

just want to say thanks for handling your tape distribution the way you do...
non-profit.  that's the way it should be done.  there's nothing wrong with 
making a living in the rave scene, but you got to put the music up as
a number one priority...and you do.

love,

hi stephanie...

uhm, no i dont think that the sour tour will be stopping in phiily, right
now the tentative shows are in boston, nyc, pgh, chicago, arizona, and l.a.
with the possibility of shows being added in richmond va, perhaps north
carolina (but i doubt it) and maybe one or two more stops between chicago
and l.a.


i just came back from dc and nyc this weekend.. big top 2 was ok but man o
man was SUPERSTAR at twilo in nyc fucking amazing.. i've been thinking and
thinking and it just might be the best party i've been to all the way since
RED in boston back in like '94.. oh my god....jean phillipe (yup dc's old
homeboy now in la i think) rocked it.. DANNY TENAGALIA FUCKING KILLED US!
(i lost it when he spun hypnosis by psychotropic at 33! :) and then terry
mullan stepped up to the plate and belted out yet another home run...:) :)

i was really looking fwd to hearing mark farina, but the night was only
slightly less amazing in his absence...if you can go to twilo to hear danny
tenaglia spin ...ever...  do it! the club is called twilo and it is pure
perfection (530 w. 27th st in manhattan) ... the speakers are enclosed
behind columns at each corner of the wicked danceflooor.

i would urge all of you who are interested in attending a world class event
(the kind you read about in mixmag and muzik) to go to the next one,
scheduled for july 3...but until then, liberty looks sweeeet :) hmmm you
could catch tenaglia at twilo on friday nite and then go to liberty the
next day... yeah sounds like a plan....;)

peace,
hossam

Comparison shop if you want.  An important part about the financial end of
promoting raves that you may be missing is experience and environment.  In
Baltimore and New York, obviously, there are a great deal more people into
raves, and there *will* be a more profitable turnout than in Pittsburgh.
Also, I presume the people promoting parties in more rave-friendly regions
have less financial burden on their backs.... it's hard to justify 22
billion DJs for $5 when you're already in debt several thousand dollars
from previous disappointments.

I don't mean to say there are not people out there trying to rake in
cash-- certainly, there are.  Rather than trying to figure out who's
price-gouging whom, I choose to support parties that have DJs I like to
hear, atmospheres that are well-thought-out, and so on.  Support is much
more effective *and* more productive than negativity.

Subject: tekknoBOX ][ - new beta
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

A new beta for tekknoBOX ][ will be made available on my web site and ftp
site this Sunday.

This is one of the final betas before it goes retail.

For those that don't know ... tekknoBOX ][ is a MIDI sequencer for windows
that emulates and, hopefully, improves on standard sequencers found in most
analog gear, most notably the 909 and the doepher.  It's been in development
for a year now, and is finally gearing up to be a finished piece of work.

The current version has roughly 4,000 users.

The url for the web site is:

http://www.inneraktive.com

or

ftp://ftp.inneraktive.com in the inneraktive/ directory

Thanks.

earache

sorry no wise like raves, just some wanna be like smart ones....
I'm not rippin on anybody who organizes these things because I have tried
and it doesn't work unless you have like a lot of people working together.
That takes organization, leadership, motivation, and most of all investment. 
        However, I think that some oorganizations must be doing something
right here in pittsburgh because I'm enjoying what the rave scene here has
evolved in to.
There are three upcoming raves like soon:
        The Phanny Dance, May 31
        Get Busy, June 15
        Togetherness, June 8

peace.

well, the mixtapes end up costing 10+$ by the time they get to the ppl
selling them at tables at parties.  there's a store in chicago that has them
as high as 14$ for a mix tape.  i dont understand the principle of mostly
copyrighted music (that the dj didn't make) being sold for a profit?  i have
bought a couple myself, but only when they're cheap......laters,,,,,trouty.

well i try to get what i can on there, *BUT* i rely on ppl forwarding *ALOT*
of the information to me.  i only get so many fliers at parties.  i dont
know which party count-0 was referring to offhand, but i have noticed alot
of the parties in the pb-cle area are expensive compared to elsewhere.  i
guess it depend on who throws them.  ele-guys in cols try to get theirs as
cheap as possible and have free ones from time to time.  we're trying to
keep our weekly free as well, but might have to charge a few bux for
admission.  cleveland charges 7$ at some of their bars for a few hours of a
house dj????  i dunno...  trouty

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

Hi kids! As usual, I am posting to ask for something... I MUST
absolutely positively MUST go to sunny bear.  Its in Richmond VA on
Saturday June 15th (in case you didn't know) Thing is, thats like 7
hours drivin' from here (Pittsburgh) so here's a list of what I need
help with

a) anybody in Pittsburgh wanna go with me?

b) anybody in Baltimore or DC going to Sunny Bear and can fit 2 people
in your ride? I figure my rents will let me go to DC but probably not
all the way to Richmond. So, halfsies would be good right?

I think thats it... Can anybody help? *crossing fingers* love, Frank

(JEFF: wanna meet me in VA if I make it? not that far for you it seems)

trouty sed:
=================================================================
admission.  cleveland charges 7$ at some of their bars for a few hours of a
house dj????  i dunno...  trouty
=================================================================

hey not all cleveland events are rip-offs, for instance dan curtain's
thursday night @ the brillo pad - TURNED ON is only three bones!

here's the info that jeff/stuff posted about it on mw-raves, but
forgot to post on pb-cle-raves...

alrighy, here's who's on the guest list for TURNED ON in the upcoming weeks:



June 6

Russ Gabriel (ferox records, uk)
Dan Curtin (metamorphic, cleveland)
dj Yush (uk)

June 13

D-Knox (sonic mind records, kalamazoo)
Peter Anderson (cleveland)

anyway, this is the first QUALITY weekly thingee that i've witnessed in this
city (that has lasted for more than three weeks anyway)..it's only $3, cozy
atmosphere, and usually the music is slammin.  anyone who lives around here
and doesn't go obviously should be monitered and poked continuously for a
long period of time....

info # 216.556.3962

email info: pddi@en.com

or email me at: fj480@cleveland.freenet.edu

wonderstuff & cheez-e (sp?) & others. i don't have info # on that.
but u can call jinx @ 614.267.1106

                          Electro Phunk

You are getting sleepy, your eyes are getting heavy, your mind is
drifting back, back in time. When you awake you will remember
nothing of this encounter, only the ancient, pulsing beat shall
remain constant in your brain. The atom heart mother of this disc
is an Electro remix of Africa Bambataa & The Soulsonic Force's
Don't Stop The Planet Rock. Operating with this touchstone of
early techno and hip-hop, DJ Hardware and DJ SHARPe embrace the
royal roots of the turntable, seamlessly working UK artists like
Sem, Stem, RAC and OSC. While Electro/Techno-Bass is only a small
part of a much bigger picture, 1996 marks a triumphant return of
the deejay as resilient cultural phenomena. The raves are only
getting bigger and more numerous. Why, I can remember fifteen
years ago going to the Power Plant in Chicago, jacking to house
beats supplied by Frankie Knuckles himself and...oops, sorry. Now
where did THAT come from?
