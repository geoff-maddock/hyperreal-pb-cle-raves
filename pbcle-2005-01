Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

The b-side of "Don't Laugh" on the Nervous imprint - "How Sleep (On

turns out the Mighty Dub Katz is one of many aliases for Quentin Cook 
who started out with Beats International (Dub Be Good To Me), and is 
now commercially known for his Fat Boy Slim crap.
So now you know.

Does anyone have a CD from around that time with these songs on it? Want to post it somewhere online? It would be great to hear them all again (I  lost/damamged all my mix tapes from that time so I don't have them anymore...)

Also:

Basement Jaxx - "Samba Magic"

Josh Wink - "Higher State Of Conciousness"

Everything But The Girl - "Missing"

Jameroquai - "Space Cowboy"

De'Lacy - "Hideaway".

All I have for the moment... 1996 was more my time, when AVH pulled me out
of hip-hop and into house w/ his remixes of "Insomnia" and "Professional
Widow", along w/ "Funk Phenomena".

Oh my, there is a list!

I don't know how I could have forgotten most of those.  Time to do
some digging.  Whos has these on vinyl? ...someone has to.  I'd like
to hear someone drop a set of these tunes... either that or sell them
to me and I'll do it (:

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} '95 house anthems?

On Discogs, (http://www.discogs.com/artist/Norman+Cook) it says Norman 
Cook's real name is Quentin.  I must have fallen for someone's idea of 
a little joke.  I should have footnoted my info actually.

I completely glossed over the bit about the Housemartins on Discogs.   
I can recall liking them, though I'll be damned if I remember any 
songs.  I was also fond of Dub Be Good To Me, and I used to play the 
hell out of that Mighty Dub Katz 12" (that I'll be selling shortly on 
EBAY) in my previous life as Sista Spinsta --they still hold nostalgic 
value for me, but Fat Boy Slim met me with total indifference.  Maybe 
if I'd heard it in 94/95 I would have been into it, as it bears 
similarity to what I was buying then,  but by the time it reached my 
ears in 98 or 99, I was too deeply distracted by  other artists 
producing different sounds that appealed to me more at that time--and 
frankly, today as well.

  I think you grabbed the wrong end of the stick, so I'll clarify.  
Commercial, or not, has nothing to do with my opinion of it.  I only 
just found out there was a common link a few weeks ago.  Many chips 
fell into place, as I thought FBS seemed to pop out of nowhere.  I 
noted it only because I saw mention of MDK here and still had that 
interesting fact (#573) in my head to share.   It seems I've been 
unconsciously following Cook's career.   It didn't occur to me that I 
might be the only one who didn't know that Mighty Dub Katz and Fat Boy 
Slim were the same guy.

But in case I ever post another off the cuff remark, I've written a 
little disclaimer:

I begrudge no one his/her success (except maybe really selfishly greedy 
people), but I do reserve the right to like, or dislike, material from 
any artist, at any time, throughout his/her career.  I also reserve the 
right to let something grow on me over time, or even get sick of 
something to the point of hating it.  I reserve the right to never like 
something for no sound reason at all, and to never stop loving 
something else if I so choose.

Ciao,
Cathryn

Subject: {pb-cle} the root of the grapvine

So anyone know who started the rumor that P,H, and L was going to be cancelled?

Do we need to call Columbo?  Anyone have any clues???

I first heard it on PB-Cleve by Nick S. on 12/29 and then on 
Clevelandnightlife.net by Metropolis on 12/31.

The reason I am asking is because a friend wrote me an email - "I 
don't understand why people would spread rumors like that and cause
some peeps not to show up.  That's about messed up"

Agreed, Wink's was a rip-off.  I remember a Josh Wink
slam session on the G-tech list about two years ago. 
Ovum records did some blatant stealing of Dan Bell's
sounds.  I think it even went to court?  not sure.

>>>>>And dont tell me its
  Reason.

Awwww son of a.......well....if I can't use reason....than how bout =
imagination and creativity?  Yeah, it was all done in reason.  Question. =
 Is it looked upon as being cheap if a dude writes music in reason?  =
Simply because everyone uses it?  If so, I have an at least somewhat =
reasonable defense.  Picture this.  You have a group of 50 guitarists =
lined up, some good some bad.They're all lined up in front of a marshall =
half-stack with a variation of some DOD processor, and a Gibson Les Paul =
to play on.  First off, each guitarist that steps up is going to sound =
completely different from the other.  The ones that are really good will =
make the setup shine to the point where it doesn't even matter the =
equipment they're playing on.  There's no hostility in this response =
whatsoever.  Just interesting point of debate.  I know about the =
software versus hardware war.  I use both.  I only use hardware for =
control mainly, and when I play live to do cool transitions and shit.  =
The thing about reason is, it's cheap.  Which means alot of poeple who =
normally wouldn't be making music, are.  There's nothing wrong with =
that.  Making music is fun.  I may even be one of those poeple myself.  =
but judging by your compliments, maybe I'm on the right track.  Anyway, =
if you dug that, theres plenty more at thescythianproject.com.  All free =
and at least worth a listen or two.  Hope to hear responses from poeple =
on this one.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} pimps, hos, limos, etc

I had originally planned on going just the second night, but some of my
friends were playing excellent sketch artists, so they convinved me into
going for NYE too, despite having a thousand other things to do. :-\ ...

Well I got there and I didnt really wanna leave. Wasnt really jammin early
on, but it was nice to see the nest filling up again. Sound and lighting was
pretty ok. Gotta love the introspective on the laser tip though. Everyone
seemed to show on the first night, though timeslots shoulda been posted.
None of the headliners I really cared to see were there the first night, but
i didt catch 1 or 2 good locals. Lotta fun hanging out though, all night. [U
GOTTA learn to do that, no matter where your ass iz at...take it from a pro
...it makes life more fun ]. Anyways, bumped i knew and didnt all night.
Ended going to my dudes after party which was acctually winding down (it
really was his NYE party)...so chilled till I went home to recharge.

Next night got all drunk and rowdy with Jea, met up with George Driver, of
coursee the rest of the crew... Just in time to miss Craze's "proposed
slot". No matter, caught a titty of the 3 way breaks madness. A lil of RHV
dropping some bad dnb...made it down to see armanni making some locals wet
dream...seemed to hold up. Armanni was cool, dusting off his shoulders on
the dusty corner of the bar, till he started getting a crowd.... Course I
had to go tell \like 40 people to come downstairs.

Anyways, he ripped it to fullfill his end of the contract...to an extent.
Driver came back with Sound Proof posse and Mo hopped on with ROb and
Jonn-e. Some good tracks for both mc's to toss back and forth some lyrics.
Anways...not much more after that, i went upstairs in time to catch John and
Wes (19/dvs). Man I saw that shit coming a mile away. People should have
brought a bib to the party, cause they got a treat! Koala tea 412 stylee be
sickee.

SD big up to deuce, sonic, and rest of crews for putting it on pretty
frizzin nice. Major werd to the heads that said sup.

But like you said, their 'International Talent' to us :)  I really  
liked Lady Bass's set at the darkrave too, not paralyzing, but still  
liked it :)  I haven't gone through my darkrave pics yet, but I'll get

Your tunes are either good or bad, it doesn't much matter what you did
it on.  Sometimes I think if I fully switched over to sx my shit would

its not sampling. its making the same track and calling it your 
own. usually people who sample things are very straightforward 
about saying they sample, even if they cant tell you who or what 
because of copyright laws. its like writing a paper for school. 
sampling is like using someone else's idea and giving them credit 
for it in a footnote (interesting how you can cite material in 
literature but you cant in music without paying crazy money, isnt 
it?) whereas what wink did is like plaguarizing someone else's 
work by putting your name on it and pretending you wrote it. big 
difference.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} '95 house anthems?

i'd give a toe to be at metropol on a thursday
night in 95.  the absolute pleasure of knowing no one
and dying over good music.  i seriously haven't had
that much fun at a club or party since that weekly.

these tracks remind me of that year or so.

and aside from dan bell, all i ever think of when i hear the
laugh track is how andysine and kevin would get on the mic at cloud
9 and laugh over the laugh for the duration of the laugh - making
it an even more annoying track than it already is.  aside from the
money, he should be glad someone else got credit for it.  of course,
his version was much 'cooler' ;p


river ocean - love and happiness
cj bolland - sugar is sweeter
billie ray martin - your lovin arms
ruffneck - everybody be somebody
hardrive - deep inside
the goodmen - give it up
dubtribe - mother earth
sagat - fuk dat
professional widow
junior vasquez - get your hands off my man
angel moraes - welcome to the factory
orbital - are we here (for kicks:)

hes only released a couple records since 97, most of them being 
older 95 era tracks of his. i can think of about 5 tracks he's 
done since 00 and i bet youve never heard one of them since theyre 
pretty obscure.

they probably still got played in 95...):

Software can do literally anything hardware can. You can even put it in
a pretty case with knobs and sliders if you want.

oh yeah...one other thing...just about all the hardware out now is nothing
more than a dedicated computer...you might as well say all hardware is
souless too cuz most of it just moves around zero's and ones now

even old analog hardware could be considered a computer...there is no easy
way to explain this...other than synthesis is just a bunch of alegebra and
trig(like everything else in electronics)...and since the output is just the
solution of the varibles of the oscilators....and the envelope is your
constant...all you are doing is COMPUTING.

Indeed.  Also, please see answer above.

Hey Iâ€™m not going to argue about this because I know Iâ€™m right.
I have both hardware and software and know the difference between both.

Hardware, at lease the kind I like, is somewhat custom, sometimes handmade.
Futuretro, moog, access etc
There is a family, a legacy behind the name. And I love to support them.
I donâ€™t see a legacy behind a company called Propellerhead, sorry.

Hardware is tangible, touch it feel it, key in those heart felt notes.
Ohhhh... twist the knobs.  Thatâ€™s better, welcome to the real world Neo.

Software is soulless man made garbage made by soulless people who stare at
computers all day and think of new ways they can make a buck off of suckers
like
ourselves for the next best upgrade.

Sure hardware companies (and I loath the newer consumer infested crap by
Korg
and Roland) are guilty of this also by holding back technology to sell in a
future release.  But at least they are releasing something.
A warehouse full of synths, not a whorehouse full of warez.

I have every current release of whoreware there is.  You can take it.
I prefer to sit behind a keyboard and trigger gear anyday.

I still like your track, keep it up.
and switch to your hardware.

peace

J

Info:

Legowelt
Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases
most of his music. What Music you might ask??? Well a
hybrid form of slam jack The Hague electronix combined
with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic ghetto
technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more!
You can't quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell
slams the pit!
Already a few years in the business Legowelt has
released a dozen or so projects on various formats,
most of them on good ol' vinyl released on homebase
Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering
electronic music label. Sometimes these tracks spin
out of the obscurity like an asteroid from a spacebelt
and fly straight into the charts; such an event
happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of
the year 2002 by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies
the adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic
contact with the sounds of Detroit's Underground
Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably his
all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as
Farley Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers.
Later on this palette of influences grew with early
Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff from The
Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked
deep music he could get his hands on.
But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere
in the early 90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit
Moebius' on the radio. A punky palette of RAW freaked
out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made with
machines which were found next to the garbage can.
Shocked in awe he heard that this music came out of
The Hague, Holland The very same city he lived in! Put
on the right track by this fact he stumbled into the
Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of
contemporary autistic freaked music lovers who looked
beyond all the bland house and dance music that ruled
the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more
unknown sounds such as early electro and the obscure
pre-1983 Italian disco which production secrets were
closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the first
vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled
Italo Chicago combi which became an instant cult hit
with tracks such as 'Stumvogel' and 'Total Pussy
Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your
mind! Empty cold pametex-style electro from the nordic
territories, a sinister film noir movie soundtrack,
chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of
the staccato minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected
melodies and haunting tensions in between beats. Orgue
Electronique is not only known for the releases he did
on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That
Never Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album)
and various compilations, but also for his
collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker Records.
Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage,
who did releases on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared
on the DJ Hell mix CD on React. Besides all this,
Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to
Detroit, from Tokyo to New York, sharing the stage
with many well known artists.

Catnip
Catnip is the mysterious international team of
producers bringing you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
In the summer of love TLR started playing at
punkparties in youth homes that were later closed for
asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded Global
Darkness and became involved in organising underground
Jungle parties in the totally freaked out and fucked
up squat scene of the West Coast of Holland area;
filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and
legions of crustie tekno travellers like SP23 looking
to escape the '94 Criminal Justice Act and redefine
noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept
away by the first wave of The Hague electronics and
the early works of I-F, Pametex and Electronome when
DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed
from the mind numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to
dominate the airwaves at the time and refueled a love
for electro in him that had been dormant since the mid
80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the
Clone recordshop (that was then housed in a small and
dark backroom of Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters
really got out of hand. TLR started cultivating his
newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon
after the original Global Darkness crew went separate
ways. He made the Bunker Records website and started
Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on
the Internet. In 2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser
DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius fame) concocted the
Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the
few Bunker live acts) along to spread the dirty brown
gospel. The Bunker Team was born and he slowly
rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio
Italo/disco sounds of his childhood through the mixes
of I-F and sunday afternoon tea sessions in the
luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue Electronique.
And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur
became a reality, and they've been touring ever since.
The end of 2001 saw the birth of the Crème
Organization. What started out as a little playground
for Mr Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions
with consecutive releases of Lolita Strap, Bangkok
Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization has
been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly
gained a cult following. The following years shit got
a little crazy for Crème and the Bunker Team with
several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In
2005 DJ TLR will hold residencies Madrid but also in
Tokyo and Osaka, introducing European electro talent
in Japan.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Happy New Yea

I present exhibit A:
www.thescythianproject.com/images/DSCN1417.JPG

see the big silver box? how bout that keyboard with all those knobs and
buttons and sliders?  Yeah, the sounds in the song are done in reason.  The
main loops are recorded in reason.  RECORDED, not drawn in with a mouse.  I
play keyboards, twist knobs, and everything from those two big ole' peices
of hardware you see sittin there.  After all, this is true live PA over
hear.  My recording process is completely assanine.  Basically, get all my
loops layed out in reason, press record on an outside software wave
recorder, and cut through the sound like a sonic boom, using, of course,
hardware.  Reason is just another peice of hardware as far as I'm concerned.
I rarely use a mouse when I play live.  Although, I find your standard
sensor pad on a laptop can actually be thought of as a cheap man's Kaos Pad.
Just hold down the button on anyt in particular effect, and go crazy on the
pad.  It's pretty cool.  I also map out all my mute buttons on my keyboard.
Seem to get tighter beat breaks that way.  Plus for some reason, whewn I
trigger a mute from the RS7000,  i actually have to sit there and hold the
button down to keep it muted.  Dumb shit.  Anyway, as far as sticking to
hardware, well, I used to.  I present exhibit B:

www.thescythianproject.com/music.html

scroll all the way down to the misc. section.  You'll se a song called The
Big Picture Rising.  This was actually a historical track (for me anyway).
Probably one of the first somewhat danceable songs I had ever written.  Oh
yeah, It was straight from my trusty RS7000.  No software.  See, I ran into
this problem with hardware though.  I used it.  ALOT.  Which means,
inspiration became less and less as the years went on.  The expandability of
hardware is my problem with it.  If you want new sound, you gotta go out and
blow 1500 on a new module.  Fuck that.  If anyone is making us into suckers,
it's the hardware companies with their insane prices.  I totally feel ya on
software bein souless, which is why I recommend to anyone getting into
software, you better get some fucking control if you really wanna use it to
it's fullest potential.  If your more on the producing end of things though,
you don't need so much.  I am live PA, and if anyone ever gets to see this
PA live, I highly recomend it.  Still lookin for gigs guys.  I'll blow the
fuckin roof off if I have to die trying.  I guarantee, you won't see me
mousin around to much.  Unless it's to cue a track.

Which info line?  Did Sonic's info line say the show was cancelled?

As a side note, it is curious in the 2k5 that a party would have an 
infoline and not a website...

You know what else is weird.  When synthesizers and hardware first came
out....did it not suffer much flack from all of the purists who said
"electronic music is fake and soulless".  "Gimme guitar, but save your
synthesizer crap".  I remember, I was playing in a shitty industrial band.
Called ourselves Chemical Fear.  I powered the whole bands rythym section
using a Zoom RT-123.  Oh, and two 4 and half feet tall church organ
speakers, I shit you not.  Anyway, our first show, someone yelled "GET A
REAL DRUMMER!!!!"   So here we are now, in 2005, where this new thing called
software, suddenly, a whole new group of purists emege.  "Arrrghhh,
hardware's better than software, blah blah blah."  Sit Ubu, sit.  Good
doggy.  While you sit there......I'm gonna take a couple steps forward.  I
know I know, this is insulting.  I'm sorry.  You dug the track.  You
probably don't like me to much now I'm assuming.

Anyone who considers hardware to be "purist" anything is probably still  
listening to house music and thinking it's new.

All things aside, the dude dug my track, so it's all good.  I know the "sit
ubu sit" comment was harsh and out of line.  I just have a weird sense of
humour.  If someone insulted me like that, I would laugh and then fire off
my own brand of wit.  Anyway, I do wanna try and be less of an asshole on
here and any place else.  I do see my website is getting hits and songs are
being checked out, which is the point.  If any of you are on that list,
thank you, seeing my hits go up makes me very happy.  Sure 90% of the poeple
probably listen and think "this sux"  I know there are some who dig it.  And
that...is tits.

Dude, that is a badass track.  There were alot of good tracks on the first
movie's soundtrack.  Fuckin KMFDM, Sister Machine Gun, of course Orbital.
And somehow, a track by a certain ex-pornstar Traci Lords.  Even managed to
be a pretty bangin track.  Anyone know how she was involved with the making
of that?

Of course.  Like any liberal, it doesn't matter who you piss off or what  
principles you don't have; as long as SOMEONE pays attention to you.

Actually, I spent this whole past summer knockin down beers and liquor with
my pops.  And my mom's the greatest.  Also, personally, I don't like poeple
who push their god, whether it's the Lord Almighty, or President Bush.  I
also have a distaste for poeple with NO sense of humour who can't take a
good insult.  Smoke some weed and drink some fuckin beer dude.  It'll loosen
ya up a bit.

Also, for future reference, I will not get involved in any political, or
religous debates.  Save it.  Believe what you want.  The only religion I
follow is life.  The only parties I belong to, are the ones goin on
downtown.
Also I read the article about how a democrat supposedly signed the rave act
or whatever.  Quite honestly,  I don't give a fuck who signed the son of a
bitch.  They're just a lame ass fatcat in the end.

Spoken like a true liberal moron.

"The only religion I follow is life." - hahahahahahaha!!!!!


Why does the failed electronic music "scene" get nothing but the bottom  
feeders anymore?  Oh wait...because it sucks, that's why.

You let me know the last time Our President "pushed his religion" on you,  
ok?


I'll be waiting...it oughta be a great story (lol!)



Oh, btw, do you believe in global warming?  How about socialism?   
Communism?  Enviromentalism?  The Democratic Party?  They're all  
religions, as in they have no basis in fact, and even run COUNTER to fact.

What was that about religion?  Maybe you should take Rachel Carson for  
what she is:  an anti-capitalist, anti-american zealot.

Well first off, you need to learn how to read or something.  I said I don't
like poeple who push religion or politics.  I never stated that bush pushed
religion.  I don't listen to him.  If he's on the TV, it's like, Oh wow,
there's another guy talkin about some shit I don't care about.

What the fuck are you talking about?  Seriously.  It's all french to me.

>>>>Translation = "Get fucked up, you'll vote Democrat, >>>because you don't
have
>>>>>to think".

Translation from me=Get fucked up, than you won't vote at all, and support
the government we all allow to exist,  the government that takes our right
to party,  because we're to stupid to realise the mass numbers we are, and
to stupid to realise how much we are each in charge of our own life.

>>>>Why does the failed electronic music "scene" get >>>nothing but the
bottom
>>>>>>feeders anymore?  Oh wait...because it sucks, that's why

Because assholes like you are sitting at the top with your noses turned up,
thinking your cool because you played a couple parties..

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  So far all but one person
thinks this is a good idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Info:

Legowelt
    Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases most of his
music. What Music you might ask??? Well a hybrid form of slam jack The
Hague electronix combined with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic
ghetto technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more! You can't
quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell slams the pit!
    Already a few years in the business Legowelt has released a dozen or
so projects on various formats, most of them on good ol' vinyl released
on homebase Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering electronic
music label. Sometimes these tracks spin out of the obscurity like an
asteroid from a spacebelt and fly straight into the charts; such an
event happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of the year 2002
by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
    Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies the
adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic contact with the sounds
of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably
his all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley
Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers. Later on this palette of
influences grew with early Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff
from The Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked deep
music he could get his hands on.
    But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere in the early
90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit Moebius' on the radio. A punky
palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made
with machines which were found next to the garbage can. Shocked in awe
he heard that this music came out of The Hague, Holland The very same
city he lived in! Put on the right track by this fact he stumbled into
the Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of contemporary autistic
freaked music lovers who looked beyond all the bland house and dance
music that ruled the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more unknown sounds
such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco which
production secrets were closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the
first vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled Italo Chicago
combi which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as 'Stumvogel'
and 'Total Pussy Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
    Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your mind! Empty
cold pametex-style electro from the nordic territories, a sinister film
noir movie soundtrack, chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
    Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of the staccato
minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected melodies and haunting tensions
in between beats. Orgue Electronique is not only known for the releases
he did on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That Never
Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album) and various
compilations, but also for his collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker
Records. Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage, who did releases
on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared on the DJ Hell mix CD on React.
Besides all this, Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to Detroit, from Tokyo
to New York, sharing the stage with many well known artists.

Catnip
    Catnip is the mysterious international team of producers bringing
you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
    In the summer of love TLR started playing at punkparties in youth
homes that were later closed for asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded
Global Darkness and became involved in organising underground Jungle
parties in the totally freaked out and fucked up squat scene of the West
Coast of Holland area; filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and legions of crustie
tekno travellers like SP23 looking to escape the '94 Criminal Justice
Act and redefine noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept away by the first
wave of The Hague electronics and the early works of I-F, Pametex and
Electronome when DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed from the mind
numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to dominate the airwaves at the time
and refueled a love for electro in him that had been dormant since the
mid 80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the Clone
recordshop (that was then housed in a small and dark backroom of
Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters really got out of hand. TLR started
cultivating his newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon after the original
Global Darkness crew went separate ways. He made the Bunker Records
website and started Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on the Internet. In
2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius
fame) concocted the Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the few Bunker live
acts) along to spread the dirty brown gospel. The Bunker Team was born
and he slowly rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio Italo/disco
sounds of his childhood through the mixes of I-F and sunday afternoon
tea sessions in the luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique. And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur became a reality, and
they've been touring ever since. The end of 2001 saw the birth of the
Crème Organization. What started out as a little playground for Mr
Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions with consecutive releases
of Lolita Strap, Bangkok Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization
has been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly gained a cult
following. The following years shit got a little crazy for Crème and the
Bunker Team with several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In 2005 DJ TLR will
hold residencies Madrid but also in Tokyo and Osaka, introducing
European electro talent in Japan.

Sat Jan 22                      TAG YOU'RE IT                       Toronto

On Saturday, January 22nd, 2005, Nocturnal Commissions and Glowin' 
Turtle are proud to present an old-school party to help start the new 
year off proper --

Featuring some of the finest and funnest (it's a word!) DJs and MCs in 
the NorthEast, including:

Dexyl (US) vs Sebby Bozak (UK Hard House)
Frisky vs END (Jungle)
Scoots vs Glow (Happy Hardcore)
Dirk D (US) vs Virus (Anything Goes!)
Baby Duck vs Tranzit (Euro)
Wolf vs Bliss (US) (Happy Hardcore Skratch Battle)
Apathy vs Gobstoppa (Gabber)
Tyco vs Kix (HHC w/ DnB)
Milo vs Andee Dee (US) (Happy Hardcore)
Xphox vs Dynamic (US) (Happy Hardcore)

w/ MCs: Rukkus, END, ED, Gobstoppa, ROC, and Loki

With fresh fruit, candy, and CD giveaways all night long, in true rave 
tradition!

Why the name "Tag! You're IT!" ? Partly because every set of the night 
is a tag set, which we at NC believes promotes the spontanaity (you 
can't spell it either Razz ) of real hardcore raving... but also because 
this is a Grafitti party! The FIRST Grafitti party in Toronto EVER! (It 
should be noted that we have made no attempt to confirm the truth of 
this statement. At all. Ever. ) So wear a white tshirt, bring a marker, 
and leave your PLUR book at home - at this party, we're writing on 
ravers all night! ATTENTION - THE WALL IS NOT A RAVER! IF IT DON'T MOVE, 
DON'T TAG IT! Thank you

Tickets will be available at Numb and 2 The Beat starting December 18th 
- tickets are 10$ CAD presale and 15$ CAD at the door OR if you bring a 
friend, tickets are 2 for 25$ at the door, so grab your buddy, sister, 
designated driver, heck even George Bush and save a few dollars! 
(Editors note: We charge extra for George Bush). Bars will be 
conveniently located near the venue - if you can't find one, just follow 
any MC. Wink

PLUR, ROAR, and VERYVERYDRUNK in full effect!

Jan 28-29                 BRUTAL CINCINNATI DAMAGE               Cincinnati

28+29 January 2005
BRUTAL CINCINNATI DAMAGE
2 days of multimedia anxiety and a benefit for Art Damage Radio.

This event will be an exciting collection of primarily aggressive work 
by artists in the Cincinnati area. Performance and non-static media are 
the focus, involving local noisicians, graff/street art representation, 
and extremities of punk, hip hop, and techno culture. Loosely, the goal 
for these two days is the production of a highly engaging, emotive, and 
physical compilation of work which can be accredited largely to the 
high-energy of our city’s least passive youth and arts community. All 
hypothetical monetary profit from admissions will go to the account of 
Art Damage for use in future events and/or disasters.

Let the head retard reply by simply stating I have been right since the 
beginning
and its nice to see soo many heart felt posts on the subject.  
But still, I would love to reiterate

cd = digital garbage
vinyl = art
softsynths = heartless useless bastardization
hardware = lovely industrial design and technology

Bring back the reel to reels!  Regress my children!

Thanks and carry on to your regularly scheduled drama.

first off, at least he believes in something.  there are plenty of
people that dont have anything to believe in.  secondly, who the fuck
are you to judge anyone?  you used to sell meth to your friends.  YOUR
FRIENDS.  Most people try to "take the needle" out of their friends'
arms, not put it in.

I'm not judging you based on that, rather challenging what the hell
gives you the right to say anything to anyone else about their
personal morality.

I'm not defending his religion of life, rather his freedom of
religion, (so john, don't think that i am really on your side on the
life is religion thing)

i had this DOD "Classic Tube" that was either broken or on crack.
it was responsible for the firey deaths of about 4 or 5 amps
before my friends ripped it apart when i wasnt looking. the thing
deserved to die, but it sounded SOOOOOOO great. lovely crap
distortion. i think i might buy another one.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Happy New Yea

the 303 sequencer is a real pain in the ass imo...the mc-202 seems like it
has a painful sequencer as well

the only hardware sequencers that i actually dont mind using are on the
x0x's...the 606 perhaps has the best sequencer of any drum machine ever.

anyone know of a good reaktor book....i just got into this incredibly =
powerful app...but i could use some guidance on the more difficult stuff =
like creating step sequencers and samplers.

i got all the NI documentation, but its a bit on the basic side for what =
im looking to do...basically i wanna design my modular in the software =
realm first...then as i have the time and money, build a hardware =
version of it(sans any sampling)

it doesnt matter if its a pain or not. you can usually spot a fake
303 line because of the attempts to copy its accents and slides...

....he says in an email. Sent from a computer. Ironic, no?

Ya gotta take the bad with the good, man. There's an up and down side to
EVERYTHING.

I've heard hundreds of bad records made with drums, guitar and bass, let
alone drum machines and other expensive, exclusive machinery, so...as has
been said many times before...this hardware vs. software thing is a
POINTLESS argument.

And furthermore, for every argument you make that hardware is better than
software, there's been 10,000 people before you that argue that drums, bass
and guitar are better than drum machines and synthesizers.

When will it stop? It's pointless.

It's not what you use, it's how you use it. The machinery is a moot point
without the proper human behind it to bring it to life.

I don't care if you've got a coffee can, a stick, and a "My First Sony" to
record it. If it's good music, it doesn't matter what you make it with.

i remember doing cutups of sorts with a small reel to reel when i was a 
weeee little trout.  we would cut snippet of sound bites and splice them 
together with scotch tape.  mad ghetto.  but fun.  too bad we didn't 
figure out how to do loops back then, ahaahahaha.
but me. nope i dont know or care how to change tape speed.  i haven't 
owned anything that takes tapes in many years.  right now the only cd 
players i have are my cd/dvd drives.  my ipod ownz me.  its worse than 
crack.

I thought a hitler reference officially closses a thread (so now that I

That does not compute either.

>>>...this hardware vs. software thing is a POINTLESS argument.<<<<

Your right, just keep doing what your doing.  Keep downloading your bullshit 
mp3s.  
Yea support the music industry by ripping them off.   Keep downloading 
bullshit software, mostlikley warez.  Rip those guys off too, the ones that make the 
products you so strongly support.
You have to know when to stop SOMEWHERE.
And I chose to support real musicians with real components who support
real companies who actually produce tangible goods.  Not a box with a disk in 
it.
Or a bullshit download.  Ohhh I have the CrAcK for that one too!

>>>>And furthermore, for every argument you make that hardware is better than
software, there's been 10,000 people before you that argue that drums, bass
and guitar are better than drum machines and synthesizers.<<<

True dat, true dat, but please read following statement carefully

You have to know when to stop SOMEWHERE.
And I chose to support real musicians with real components who support
real companies who actually produce tangible goods.  Not a box with a disk in 
it.

>>>>When will it stop? It's pointless.<<<<<

It wont I like discussing this, do it all day long , keep em coming...
It will stop when people realize this freewarez dime a dozen musician
faceless music bullshit floods the market even further with more garbage.

It will stop when these guys want to make the move from playing with
a toy consumer product (reason) and want to move into a professional 
environment.
Sorry fella but I challenge you to find a production facility that uses this 
crap.  
They just dont , look into it. 
(mostly reason talking bout here, there are SOME decent soft synths out there 
Ill give you that) 

>>>>.It's not what you use, it's how you use it. The machinery is a moot point
without the proper human behind it to bring it to life.<<<<<<

Like I said, your right , keep doing what your doing.

>>>I don't care if you've got a coffee can, a stick, and a "My First Sony" to
record it. If it's good music, it doesn't matter what you make it with.<<<<

Now THAT is funny.  Great visual.  Put it on your resume       mkay>?

what about those of us who buy only vintage gear? the only
companies we're supporting are the people selling the old shit on
ebay!

Subject: {pb-cle} Harvard Scientists Investigate Ecstasy's Last Rites

American scientists are to give MDMA to people suffering from terminal 
cancer,
to test whether the drug can help people cope with the final days before 
death,
in a new study that's gained approval from US authorities.

"End of life issues are very important yet there are very few options for
patients who are facing death," study chief Dr John Halpern told the 
Telegraph.
"I'm hoping we can find something that will be of use to people in their
remaining days of life."

The study coincides with another project already underway, which is 
examining
the usefulness of magic mushrooms for terminally ill patients. Chief 
scientist
Charles Grob, a psychiatrist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles 
told
the Washington Post this week that the shroom trials are already showing
encouraging results.

"So far they have had very impressive results in terms of amelioration of
anxiety, improvement of mood, improved rapport with close family and friends
and, interestingly, significant and lasting reductions in pain," said Mr 
Grob.

"These are extraordinary compounds that seem to have an uncanny ability to
reliably induce spiritual or religious experiences when taken in the right
conditions," he claimed.

The musician is more important than his instruments. I'd rather hear
someone with real talent using Reason to put together his music than a
twit without a clue (turning some knobs, banging on some keyboard,
screeching on some guitar).

spirituality shouldn't need to be chemically induced?   and especially 
religious experiences.  but humans have been doing it for so long.  am i 
breaking the rules?  *doh*

is that what i've been doing wrong all these years?  i was debating even 
putting that switch in the back that gave the option for sync or midi, 
and rewiring the sync jack to just be the midi in, and it would look 
like a regular 303 from the outside and no ugly drilling.   oh did that 
make me wince---taking a drill to my new toy.

i liked the 707 sequencer, i used it to trigger random analogue 
modules.  the 707 sounded very "rock"   :)

and the 303 seq was barbaric.  sometimes i regret selling the 606, i was 
thinking of modding it with those kooky outboard rigs.

This is a bit early but...  
not to early to start celebrating TGIF!


Dr. Albert Hofmann will celebrate his 99th birthday on January 11, 2005! 
Dr. Hofmann first synthesized LSD-25 in 1938 while working at Sandoz 
Laboratories in Basle Switzerland. He became the first person to discover its 
psychedelic effects on April 16, 1943. 

http://www.maps.org/

Dr. Albert Hofmann, on the occasion of celebrating the 50th anniversary of 
his famous bicycle ride: 

"You, my dear friends, and millions all over the world who now commemorate 
the 50th birthday of ergot's child, we all testify gratefully that we got 
valuable help on the way to what Aldous Huxley said is the end and the ultimate 
purpose of human life--enlightenment, beatific vision, love. I think all these 
joyful testimonies of invaluable help by LSD should be enough to convince the 
health authorities, finally, of the nonsense of the prohibition of LSD and of 
similar psychedelics."

well i avoid dubtribe, not into the music, but respect them as 
performers.  same with hesohi and oh whats-her-name from akron.

coolest live PA i can remember is prototype 909.  family affair 2 i think?

favorite was hardfloor...   i <3 hardfloor.

dac crowell was always good to chill out to, and he brought PILES of 
goodies.

i had fun doing mine at times, but dragging the gear around took its 
toll and i'll probably never do another one again.   though i have a 
pretty minimal rig setup right now and could probably do one off my 
laptop and a few pieces of gear if i had a midi interface for it.  i'm 
down to one rack of gear now.....   i've thought about it but probably 
wont.  i'm lazy.

Midisport 2x4 is a good little interface.  2 ins, 4 outs.  Also, since you
use apple, this app might come in handy....

Dood pleaz dont go there.  I made a point not to mention Smart-E.
What the hell would you bring dat up fo>?  I was actually there, not a high 
light of
my life.  The point is that it is much more enjoyable seeing and hearing the 
real deal
rather than the nose to the computer dealeo...  it seems more... real>?
Zounds a bit better too me thinks.

i dont use apple.  the monitor and silver computer case fool everyone.  
its a pc with an DVI->ADC converter.  the monitor was dirt cheap.   i 
really don't like OS/X, plus the hardware is too expensive and not 
really upgradeable......   windows is riddled with holes but its the 
software trap, and the hardware is dirt cheap.  i can't use linux for a 
desktop.  i've tried.  it just doesn't happen.  but it's gotten better 
desktopwise.
anyhow i digress.....   i was thinking of something USB and cheap for 
the laptop.  i was wondering about those midi keyboards with audio out 
and midi.

http://m-audio.com/products/en_us/MAudioOzone-main.html

anyone used those?   i'm just worried about bad lag because of the USB, 
i see they have a firewire one now.   but my laptop doesn't have 
firewire, i suppose i could get a PCMCIA->firewire card

sonar.  people kinda snub their noses at it, but it's what i've used 
since the beginning.   started using cakewalk 1 or 2 for dos.  it's 
easier to keep using it rather than switch....  though i did almost jump 
to something else when there was so much better audio support in every 
other program.   my only bitches right now are no easy pattern based 
sequencing, and no native VST/VSTi support.  i wont upgrade until either 
or both are put in.

Ever try Cubase SX>?  I use it for my sequencing, no audio tho.
Looking at an MPC
VSTs work good but dont use em much.

Logic is supposed to be tits on Mac

I saw Wizzy Noise (goatrance) use it on a mac lap triggering gear,

not a bad show.

you can hear that 707 kick on so many old industrial tracks.   some 
plain. some processed a bit.  

i love the 909 kick though.   are people still paying outrageous prices 
on them?   i haven't priced out some of that old gear in awhile.   i 
know our synth market is really soft.  alot of the gear i sold recently 
went overseas because of the weak dollar.

lots of people use an mmt-8 live, shawn rudiman and carl craig's
innerzone orchestra for sure amongst many others. the only thing
wrong about that sequencer is lack of swing on it. otherwise what
else would you need a sequencer to do that it doesnt?

the reason alot of ppl love the mmt-8 is cuz its kinda like a
groovebox....ie u can setup i think 8 patterns and switch between them
seamlessly

the mmt-8 was definately ahead of the curve on that one.

i used to have one, it was not bad but i wouldnt use it for a main
sequencer in a studio. really i like computer sequencing a whole
big bunch, mainly for visual arrangement which is so much better
than doing it in a sequencer. but yeah you can have 8 sequences
running at once and you mute/unmute them, kinda like an mpc. you
can also step through the patterns while theyre looping, along
with muting you have a pretty simple and versatile live sequencer.
it stores alot of notes as well....

FC3 isn't bad, I use it as my desktop at work. The worst problem I see 
with Fedora/Redhat is indeed the release cycle as trout mentioned. If 
you're trying to keep a system up to date, you could be seriously 
fucked, comprimising stability for having a system that won't get pwned.

I use ubuntu on my laptop, and it's a bigger steaming pile than anything 
I've used in recent ages. Getting basic things like sound and video 
(movies) working is a total pain in the ass, and I'd venture to say you 
can't do it right without breaking your system. It's great in the sense 
that it uses apt and such and is a decent debian fork, but it's got 
problems. Major problems. I use it for development and email, that's 
about it.

Debian comes in two flavors. Stable as a rock (old old packages) or 
Breaks all the time (recent packages).

Gentoo however, while a pain in the ass to install and time consuming to 
get to using it, I've really come to love. WIDE package selection, fun 
stuff like Ximian Open Office, and things like alsa and jack work right. 
A bonus is that if you keep it updated using the built in tools, you 
never need to upgrade it with a CD or anything. That's a feature that 
works well for me, as I never sit in front of the box.

I wouldn't use anything BUT linux as a desktop. a lot of people install 
it and try to use it with windows experiences in mind, but you really 
can't. I can't live without SSH, VNC, X11 Forwarding, a /home directory, 
python, and the thousands of command line hacks I've learned over the ages.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Reaktor Books

I've been using Reaktor for about two years, heavily, a few hours a day, 
and I've still yet to scratch the surface. There's two books that come 
with it, the manual and the manual for the included machines. Read the 
actual manual about 1000 times and your brain will start putting things 
together. Some of the included machines are VERY complicated, so I don't 
recommend them as a start. The Reaktor Instruments Vol.2 machines are so 
complicated, I haven't even picked it up yet. The NI forums are a great 
source of info, probably the best, second to that I'd say there's some 
interesting reference material on em411.com if you buzz through the 
patches section.

Reaktor is incredibly complex, and you will spend a LOT of frustrating 
hours getting things the way you want, then about double that time 
optimizing your ensembles. If I had to rate its complexity, I'd put it 
up there with writing pong in a sendmail config file.

All that said, it's worth its weight in unobtanium.

It was at Echo Lake in NY, it was an Omni Tribe gig, kinda like  Nelson 
Ledges, but with goa.  Wizzy Noise, actually two guys had a JP8000 and a Nord.  A 
mixing board with a laptop for triggering.   It was fun watching the one dood 
do reverb and EQ washes this the mixing board.  They had a couple decent songs. 
 Should have been better.  Do you have their latest mix>?  I have a copy 
round here somewhere.  I have REALLY been into SafiConnection lately.  These guys 
are tight.  They blow most goa gigs out of the water as far as creativity if 
you ask me.  GMS are pretty good too  =]  
if your into goa.

I have always wanted an MPC.  I had an MMT8 for years but had to let it go.
They were unstable, mine would crash like 2-3 times a year and all data would 
be gone.  its Like ok, lets start over AGAIN.

I can see why you would get rid of the MPC if you wernt into lugging gear 
around.  It is soo much easier working in a visual editor no doubt.  
Talk about a better workflow.  Paging through all those menues is always a 
bitch.

I will get one soon after my Access TI comes.  I must have a MPC!
I get this sexual feeling seeing a piece of hardware triggering gear.  I 
dunno, its a sickness. =]

So do you like CubaseSX>?  I have a copy of that laying round here somewhere, 
wink wink.

I have a friend who has worked in Sonar for years.  
I offered his CubaseSX with all the VSTs
DX7, B3, Reactor, Absynth, Korg, Moog VST etc.  AND a copy of Atmosphere, 
Trilogy and Stylus.  And he STILL wouldnt switch formats..  Whats up with you 
Sonar Guys>?

I have a 909, its over rated.  I would prefer to have one of those Novation 
Drumstations 
(909-808 clones).  You have more control MIDI wise and sounds good too. 
The 909 just looks good on stage or in a studio shot.  I will hold onto it 
for nostalgia.
I have to check that 707 kick again, its been years since Ive heard one.

all non analogue sequencers are digital and are basically
specialized computers. the mmt-8 is a computer. whats so bad about
computer sequencing anyway? most classic jungle tunes were made
with nothing but a sampler and an atari. no analogue involved but
the music is still classic and still has the good vibes.

all i can say is he was one HOT muthafucka..  (with that hat on) ungh. Without it, he was poo poo. ;)
 
I got to spend a nice car ride back to Pittsburgh with him, talking about Nick Dunlap and some Philly heads. =)     He's actually a cool guy. His original tunes sounds real good as well. Im just not a huge fan of his djing. (Was back in the day tho.)
 
But yea...  he was hot with the hat man. ungh.

and to top it off, they should put some random lightswitches around the 
place.  And then only have some of them work... and then throughout the 
night change which ones work and which lights they control.  Chaos 
would ensue :)  Or even better, computerize it so it changes every 5 
seconds or something :)

There will be no backing up to tape here son, got rid of the thing years ago. 
 
I was probably using this thing when you were still picking your nose in jr 
high school.

A "back up to disk" would of been a bit better.  Whats the point when there 
are more stable/practacle pieces available.  Mine was definitely buggy, so it 
was much easier to get rid of it.  In fact, most of the Alesis gear I own(ed) 
has had issues.  They always do, dont they>?  I guess that would explain why 
their out of biz.   My DMpro drum unit needed service twice.  Thank god that 
piece has a card on it.

Yea.. you got to meet me sloshed all day.
 
I did nothing but sit at home on New Years Day and drink wine with my mother. THEN, get talked into fucking going there, to only drink the night away for free cause I used to work there.
 
I also got to ask Armanni "who the fuck are you" since I didnt even recognize him from when I met him in Philly. Poor guy just sat next to me talking away.. I thought he was just someone trying to have convo with me when I didnt know who he was....   yeah.. poor guy. 
 
He called me the Monica Sharp of Cleveland.. ahaha..  I got to appologize atleast, and be nerdy with him.
 
I didnt get to ask Armanni, cause I figured it wasnt any of my buisness.. but why was HE there.. and Craze wasnt?..
 
just curious.
 
And sorry to anyone else that caught me in a rage that night. I hadnt been like that in months. =)

Hah. And HE was the headliner. It took him a second to remember me, but I
cut to the chase: ?that party with Hive, you know with the shitty sound?.

i'd have to say the few times i tried cubase i wasn't able to get it to 
do the simplest things.  like make notes, so i uninstalled it.  i figure 
if any program i cant figure out the basics in a little while isn't 
worth my time.  call me stubborn, go ahead, everyone else does.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR:DiVX encoding

(and a cross-post to boot...i'm such a rebel, people call me "che"...)

can anyone point me to a super-basic tutorial or even a "here's what you
need" for encoding AVI/MPG files to DiVX...

is DiVX even the preferred codec anymore?

i'm trying to squeeze some already-encoded AVI files to make them a wee bit
smaller so i can fit more of em on a DVD backup. i figure if i can compress
the audio to like 96kbps mono, it'll buy me enough room to add a file or two
to the data-dvd i'm trying to make. (right now the audio appears to be
uncompressed PCM stereo...ugh.)

thanks in advance.

Oh yeah.

"By Saturday afternoon, Jaymes had observed that Sagdiyev looked a lot
like the title character of "Da Ali G Show," a Home Box Office production
that often catches its guests and audiences unaware and then records their
reaction to "shock value" material such as Friday night's performance.

The show has a character named Borat from Kazakhstan, according to the HBO
Web site."

I love that show!

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: DSL deal

hey pittsburgh folk...

i am the last person you would expect to actually praise a company like
verizon, but i got to give them props, and give y'all a heads up...i just
ordered DSL through them, and got a fairly decent deal.

-$29.99 (or $29.95...can't remember) per month
-$5.00 my phone bill per month since i have VZ for local and LD
And for signing up for a 12 month agreement:
-Free Wireless G Router (bundled with the Westell modem...it's all one unit)
-First month free

deal ends feb. 15th. if you've been thinking about it, now's the time, cause
when i called back in nov., they weren't offering ANYTHING close to this.

this'll be the first time since 2001 that i've had a broadband connection in
my home....i'm salivating thinking of it right this moment....

I believe that is their standard pricing on the 1.5Mb/384kb package.  The
3.0Mb/768kb package is an additional $10 per month IIRC.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Wow! Just to be nominated was really great. But to know that the support 
we received from all of you pushed us to make it to the end is really 
what counts. We love you guys in Philly and all over for voting for us!

Props to Knowledge and Rinse ... if you don't know about these dnb mags 
... you should! To even be nominated against them was surprising for us.

Spread the word ... and most of you have ... be on the lookout this 
Spring for our next issue!
Keep it local and listen for the bassline!!

Happy 2005,
Stephanie

The magnitude of this last weeks devistation in South East Asia and 
Africa is one that I think many have yet to grasp. Us American's can 
recall the loss of 3000+ victims of Sept 11th, yet many of us can only 
weep at the amount of pain that has been generated during this great 
natural disaster. At current count of this posting 52,000 people have 
lost their lives. Generations of families have been wiped out, children 
orphaned, communities devistated beyond repair and other nightmares are 
yet to come via disease and exploitation. Well last night I started to 
call in a few friends to see what we could do. People were very quick to 
offer a hand and it looks like we are going to be throwing a benefit to 
help as much as we can. My goal is to raise $10,000 between now and Jan 
14th. Along side the benefit funds I will give any and all donations 
made to Detroitmovementguide.com between now and Jan 14th to the 
American Red Cross Disaster Relief Agency. If you can not attend our 
benefit but would like to donate please use the donation button on the 
left. As for the benefit its self....

Sat Jan 22                      TAG YOU'RE IT                       Toronto

On Saturday, January 22nd, 2005, Nocturnal Commissions and Glowin' 
Turtle are proud to present an old-school party to help start the new 
year off proper --

Featuring some of the finest and funnest (it's a word!) DJs and MCs in 
the NorthEast, including:

Dexyl (US) vs Sebby Bozak (UK Hard House)
Frisky vs END (Jungle)
Scoots vs Glow (Happy Hardcore)
Dirk D (US) vs Virus (Anything Goes!)
Baby Duck vs Tranzit (Euro)
Wolf vs Bliss (US) (Happy Hardcore Skratch Battle)
Apathy vs Gobstoppa (Gabber)
Tyco vs Kix (HHC w/ DnB)
Milo vs Andee Dee (US) (Happy Hardcore)
Xphox vs Dynamic (US) (Happy Hardcore)

w/ MCs: Rukkus, END, ED, Gobstoppa, ROC, and Loki

With fresh fruit, candy, and CD giveaways all night long, in true rave 
tradition!

Why the name "Tag! You're IT!" ? Partly because every set of the night 
is a tag set, which we at NC believes promotes the spontanaity (you 
can't spell it either Razz ) of real hardcore raving... but also because 
this is a Grafitti party! The FIRST Grafitti party in Toronto EVER! (It 
should be noted that we have made no attempt to confirm the truth of 
this statement. At all. Ever. ) So wear a white tshirt, bring a marker, 
and leave your PLUR book at home - at this party, we're writing on 
ravers all night! ATTENTION - THE WALL IS NOT A RAVER! IF IT DON'T MOVE, 
DON'T TAG IT! Thank you

Tickets will be available at Numb and 2 The Beat starting December 18th 
- tickets are 10$ CAD presale and 15$ CAD at the door OR if you bring a 
friend, tickets are 2 for 25$ at the door, so grab your buddy, sister, 
designated driver, heck even George Bush and save a few dollars! 
(Editors note: We charge extra for George Bush). Bars will be 
conveniently located near the venue - if you can't find one, just follow 
any MC. Wink

PLUR, ROAR, and VERYVERYDRUNK in full effect!

Jan 28-29                 BRUTAL CINCINNATI DAMAGE               Cincinnati

28+29 January 2005
BRUTAL CINCINNATI DAMAGE
2 days of multimedia anxiety and a benefit for Art Damage Radio.

This event will be an exciting collection of primarily aggressive work 
by artists in the Cincinnati area. Performance and non-static media are 
the focus, involving local noisicians, graff/street art representation, 
and extremities of punk, hip hop, and techno culture. Loosely, the goal 
for these two days is the production of a highly engaging, emotive, and 
physical compilation of work which can be accredited largely to the 
high-energy of our city’s least passive youth and arts community. All 
hypothetical monetary profit from admissions will go to the account of 
Art Damage for use in future events and/or disasters.

Burning Star Core 11:30

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: down to the lizards

i personally think that the show is mediocre because some of the stuff
he does is just boring as hell, the few bright spots are very funny,
but most is just filler material and really not at all that
entertaining.  he should take after dave chapelle and do a 'best of'
set of shows so that it wades through the garbage skits they sometimes
use because they cant write anything funny.

Subject: {pb-cle} More '95 stuff....

Alright you all - I need fokes to rack their brains on
some tracks for me - specifically pre-1997 (91-96
preferred). I know there was already a thread on the
'95 house anthems, but I mistakenly only read a couple
of them before going on the delete frenzy (so my
apologies ahead of time).

I'm looking to expand my collection in the Freddie
Fresh/Hyperactive/Woody Mcbride/Prototype
909/Planetary Assault Systems/Tim Taylor & Dan Zamani
type section. 
Some of the labels I like to pick up in that area are:
Planet of Drums, Missile, Labworks, Freeze X, Analog,
Drop Bass, Minimalistix, Contact, Communique/Sounds,
Synewave, Prolekult, Bassex, DJAX, Plastic City, etc.

Anyone that can think of specific titles/tracks that
stick out would be of tremendous help. I'm not just
looking for Acid tracks of that time period(although
those are still primary wants - whether it's acid
house, techno, or trance), but also the jackin'
minimal stuff - think more on some of Frankie Bones'
Ghetto Technics and Planetary Assault System releases,
or most of the mixes that were put out by Dj
Hyperactive at that time. In fact if anyone happens to
know the tracklisting on his mix "Warped" - that would
be awesome - Discogs was of little help. Fanks!!

Cheers

yeah it was at one of viktor mizo's parties up there where i realized i 
really liked jungle rather alot (progress?  1997?).  it was a 2 room 
split party.  one room jungle, one room techno.  i originally went for 
the techno, but ended up in the jungle room all night.
funny part is dieselboy was at the bottom of the lineup.  thats how 
fucking on spot they do their shit up there.  i've seen some monster 
jungle lineups in TO.  bittersweet was off the hook too.

That's the only orbital cd I have, it's the one with halcyon and on and 
on and starts off with 'time becomes a loop'  Many I haven't listened 
to that cd for a couple years now.  Keep forgetting to import it into 
itunes.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} To be 12 again....

speaking of orbital... i used to listen to the "extended" version of
"The Box" nearly every night for 2 years as something to go to sleep
to... the extended version was merely a full cd rip of their cd-maxi
single with 4 different renditions of the song, ending with the vocal
version. it was like 28 minutes long, plenty of time to fall asleep.

Now this has me curious, whatever happened to them?  Did they 
officially breakup or just been laying low?  I remember someone 
mentioned something about them a couple years ago maybe.

They put out their latest, the "Blue Album", late last year.  When
they released that, they said that was it from them, and it was
buh-bye.

That said, if you only have the Brown album, it's probably worth
picking up "In Sides".

i love the way everyone makes themselves feel better about what they
play by throwing in the words "jazz"  "funky"  "soulful".

who plays hard house and acid jazz anyway ?  who plays acid jazz at all
anymore for that matter ?

wow.  that's a jazzy sportscoat you have on there ;p

 Yeah.  I remember that.  I loved the part where the harpsichord came in
 after you listened to about 3 minutes of what seemed like a creeking
rocking
 chair.  Then you had thos french pooeple come in at the end "Cyyyyuuuzzz
 he's eeendistructible.....".  Favorite track of In Sides was Dwr Budr

I've been really disappointed with Orbital's last 3 releases.  The
alltogether wasn't to shabby.  For some fucked up reason, I really enjoyed
the track Illuminate, with david grey doing vocals.  Just something about
that track.  There were some other interesting tracks on there to.The Middle
Of Nowhere was kind of boring..  Know Where To Run was a good Track.  If
your going to suggest In Sides, you should also suggest Snivilization.  It's
a shame though.  You can't find Orbital discs anywhere anymore it seems.
Unless you want that greates hits disc, where they butcher all the songs
into 3 minute singles.  Grrrrr.

The Carribbean

     During the 1960s and =E2=80=9870s, the creative re-use of
recorded music developed in Jamaica and neighboring
islands of the Caribbean-- areas also inhabited by the
descendants of West African slaves.  Here, the
legendary Jamaican sound system --speakers, amplifier,
record turntables and a mixing console-- became tools
for musicians often a few dollars shy of buying
instruments. =20
    =20
     Musical sections were cued on record players by a
DJ and released at the proper time, as an instrumental
bed over which vocalists sang.  This
re-contextualization of existing records is called
=E2=80=98version=E2=80=99 [vair-shen] in Jamaican dialect.  The use of
instrumental sections for singing gave birth to a
reggae offshoot called dub (Connell and Gibson, p.
183).

     The Jamaican /version/ relates aesthetically to
the rules of jazz and blues in the United States,
which inherently (as a part of the social fabric)
involved the sharing and repetition of ideas, musical
riffs, and vocal toasts.  Chords, chants, and lyrics
volleyed back and forth as a cultural torch, a common
property of a people who owned little else but memory
of tradition.


To the Bronx

      When the ease of global transportation allowed a
wider migration from the Caribbean to the U.S. in the
1970=E2=80=99s, Jamaica=E2=80=99s seminal style of re-using recorded
music migrated to New York=E2=80=99s Bronx. =20

    In the ghetto, disk jockey legends in the making
like Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaata
(Conell & Gibson, p. 182) selected only the funkiest
sections of disco and rock records=E2=80=94 the breaks=E2=80=94
sometimes replaying those musical parts by alternating
duplicate copies of the same record, and sometimes by
just slamming the volume faders to the break of a new
song. =20

     This style of programming the musical breaks
eventually became known as =E2=80=9Cbreak beat music,=E2=80=9D and
along with it came the familiar terms =E2=80=9Cbreak dance,=E2=80=9D=20
=E2=80=9Cb-boy=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cb-girl.=E2=80=9D  The break beat would=20=
become the
backbone of rap music, and later a genre of its own.

     It was the rhythm=E2=80=94not the written=E2=80=94that kept
African culture alive and progressing in European
colonies unable to reconcile the racist divide.  It is
somewhere here, an indefinable space straddling
continents and centuries, where I believe the communal
(yet displaced) cultures of West Africa found the
technology to preserve records of the past, and the
artistic curiosity to celebrate it. =20

    That moment of discovery loops back to the
plantation fields of the Caribbean and America=E2=80=99s
south, where rhythm and lyrical truths took place of
the written word.  That innocent, artistic desire to
merge past recordings to tell today=E2=80=99s stories is
fitting to the observation of Alan Korn, that Edison=E2=80=99s
phonograph was a device intended for the =E2=80=9Cpreservation
of sound rather than for its mass republication=E2=80=9D
(Korn, p. 222).--

White Label Records:  Sampling Under the Radar

     Copyright law hasn=E2=80=99t stopped musicians from using
unlicensed samples, any more than closing Napster has
stopped MP3 sharing.  As with the illicit file
sharers, there is still a healthy underground culture
distributing music with unauthorized samples.  =20

     White label records are a common medium in the
culture of electronic dance music (buzzwords:  techno,
rave, electronica.)  Electronic musicians tend to call
themselves producers, as if acknowledging a preference
for not guitars and musical scores, but more often
hardware, software, and a cerebral organization of
music as data.=20

     White label records supply an underground market
for unauthorized remixes of copyrighted songs, or
records that use unauthorized samples.  These records
are rare (very few pressings)--  yet abundant as an
underground genre,  due to the alluring concept of
sampling without permission from the original artist.=20

     The center circle of the record is literally
white, with no text to distinguish it or offer credits
to the producer or the source she sampled.  White
labels (and electronic dance music in general) are
preferably released on vinyl to serve the DJ=E2=80=94the
conduit of music to the masses.   Dodging legal
ramifications, the white label producer takes no
credit except for the reputation generated by
underground buzz, a penned notation on the white
label, or by nearly-invisible credits engraved in the
inner circle of the vinyl.  White label records are
usually distributed through anonymous post office
boxes, underground record stores, or the Internet.=20
    =20
     Sales are trifle next to Top 40 records, but
songs using tasteful samples in a creative way can
become popular enough in the underground to encourage
producers to continue experimenting with this audio
alchemy.=20

     To DJs and audiences in the underground dance
scene, the shelf life of a hot new record is sometimes
over within a month, if not by the end of the weekend.
With a turnover this fast, it=E2=80=99s easy to imagine a
producer with distribution connections releasing
several hundred (or thousand) copies of a sample-laden
record, with all evidence gone by the end of the
fiscal year.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday's lineup and new promos

maybe it's just me, but this doesn't seem to be a 'variety of genres'  
Variety would be a lineup with trance, house, hardcore, industrial (or 
goth or whatever it's called), goa, jungle, electro, etc.  or in 4 djs, 
trance, hardcore, jungle, industrial  (yes, I purposely left out house, 
just the lack of house would increase the variety).  or even better, 
just go to toronto :)  and there's a good one this weekend too, but 
saving up for hullabaloo.

bitch, bitch, bitch

With only 5 hours and one room to work with, would you prefer that 
we have 16 genres and sub-genres and let every dj play only 3 
records?

This isn't a motherfuckin' multi-room, all-night rave, dude.

Have fun in Toronto.

15 20-minute sets would yield 5 hours.  you could fit
all the variety your little heart desired in that.  Of
course the trance people would get pissy at that setup
'cause they'd only get to play two tracks.

Call it an ADD night.  spike everything with ritalin. 


:P

Variety, what variety.  Neither of your lists had any
variety.  Everyone knows that all that techno shit
sounds the same :P

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday's lineup and new promos 

I don't think that hardcore, trance, goa, jungle, and industrial 
would make a lot of sense in a lounge, and it would be rather 
foolish for us to book such acts when we have far less expertise 
in those genres than other promoters.  We are not in the business 
of booking DJs for the sake of appeasing every possible taste.  
Why not throw in hip hop?  Punk?  Ska?

Can one only use the term "variety" if all possible permutations 
of music are played in one night?  That's just throwing any 
semblance of musical cohesiveness out the door.

It is certainly possible to have variety within a defined range.  
And having complete musical discord from week to week is certainly 
no way to build up a loyal following. See: every club in 
Cleveland.

Having three different genres in one night (actually four, if you 
want to micro-define what the two house DJs play) is certainly not 
homogeneity.  I'm not sure why you would consider house, breaks, 
and progressive on the same night to be a lack of variety.

In any case, your opinion is your opinion.  And good music is good 
music, and we'll all be having a blast.  I would hope that 
rhetorical nuances wouldn't keep you from checking out an event.

maybe it's just me, but this doesn't seem to be a 'variety of 
genres'
Variety would be a lineup with trance, house, hardcore, industrial 
(or
goth or whatever it's called), goa, jungle, electro, etc.  or in 4 
djs,
trance, hardcore, jungle, industrial  (yes, I purposely left out 
house,
just the lack of house would increase the variety).  or even 
better,
just go to toronto :)  and there's a good one this weekend too, 
but
saving up for hullabaloo.

I thought that's all this list is? aside from the rare occasional talk 
about something actually on topic.  I think that talk about synths and

watching people trying to hit on Jea Leigh ammuses me, though :)

I'd have worded that like this:

"Act now and we'll throw an I-Pod Shuffle at the first
50 people in the door. We know you like the unexpected
and the stuff that doesn't go together. Better yet,
you won't even know what you're getting because
there's no interface!"

I think it'd be great fun to throw things at people
who think that they are going to get free shit.

or better yet, have 15 DJ's load 4 records each (or
two records if you play trance) into an I-Pod Shuffle
and let it decide what you should listen to :P  Then
absolutely nobody would know what was going on, not
even the DJ (not that DJ's normally do anyway, mind
you).  Imagine the suspense! Imagine the spontaneity! 
Imagine how much fun it'll be to hear a slayer D&B
remix followed by Castles in the Sky!

Yeah it's friday and I'm bored.  Have a good weekend
everyone!

thats a cop out...there is plenty of jungle that could come off just fine in
a lounge....same goes for just about every genre...im not telling you guys
what to book...but i agree with todd on this one...variety is more than just
progressive and breaks.

just my 2cents.

Precious, cheerful young lady, isn't she?

i wouldnt necessarily call it variety, but i wouldnt call it
non-variety.  i think it's a stretch to say variety, but not a stretch
to say variety.   it's least common denominator music based off
125-130 BPM.  that simplicity makes us like it, and want for it to be
more complex than that.  "why isnt this music more complex than it
is?"  We need to label it _breaks_, or _progressive_, or _house_ to
tell between the small subtle differences in pattern structure.  we
need to feel like it's more than just simple music.  and all we ever
end up with are all the simple elements that form together as one
prog/breaks/nu jazz/house/disco song, just we change how we arrange
some things, tweak some instrument samples, drop off and move a couple
beats here and there, and it's still the same thing, "house".  there
is variety from song to song if you really want to think about it,
even within your subgenre.  but should it be defined as variety?  or
'notable difference'?

try marketing that phrase, "We've got some _notable difference_ of
house tonight, come checks it out, 'dude'."

Subject: {pb-cle} MI5 Desperately Seeking Drug Users



Britain's secret police force MI5 have lowered their recruitment selection
standards to include  'ex-junkies and crooks' the News Of The World reported
this week, as part of a 'massive' new recruitment drive to hire more spies.

Conservative homeland security spokesman Patrick Merchant welcomed the move,
telling the tabloid "the most important asset in the security service is 
human
intelligence. If this means recruits having to come from unusual backgrounds
then so be it."

The story emerged two years after MI5 tried newspaper recruitment 
advertising
with mixed results.

"The first time MI5 advertised in the Guardian it got 14,000 applications," 
an
MI5 source told the Independent last year. "Thirteen thousand were in need 
of
serious medical help. Open recruiting attracts people who have confused MI5 
with
the SAS," he explained.

This time round, the usually highly secretive organisation are stressing 
that
honesty is their number one requirement for wannabe James Bonds.

"We realise that some of our candidates may have taken drugs (including 
'soft'
drugs) or substances in the past, and this need not be a bar to your
application," they say on their recruitment website's Frequently Asked 
Questions
page.

"As with all aspects of vetting, you must be entirely open to divulging 
details
of your drugs usage."

Meanwhile in the States, drug users seeking lucrative law enforcement jobs 
will
presumably be inspired by the example of FBI informant Carlos Ortiz, who
recently earned $135,000 reportedly tax free dollars over two years.

The onetime 'live sex performer, pimp and heroin trafficker for Colombians' 
made
his fortune informing on the activities of alleged drug dealers in 
Springfield
(MA), The Republican newspaper revealed this week, though has since 
relocated
after his cover was blown

shouldnt like some general knowledge of music be required to be a
promoter? if you dont know any punk or ska deejays im sure i could
hook that up for you. i think your music policy should be like
this: Headrush - Bringing You All The Wack Shit for like a couple
years or since when we thought it would be cool to play bad dance
music for the general public.

did you know that there are deejays who play more than one style
of records? not everyone collects only progressive or only breaks,
some people actually buy records because theyre good as opposed to
being from one genre.....

Like trout.. and of course he comes up with these sub-sub-sub-genres for 
them, too :)  Even from the 40 or so records I have, From pretty much 
all the 'main' types of trance to a couple hardcoreish (I think more 
hard trance) and, even as much as I put it down, house and disco house. 
  OK, I guess that can just be summed up in trance and house, but still 
not just straight goa or anything.

Even better, throw 50 of these, then not only put them with random 
stuff, but then randomly pull them and play it on the system.  I love 
how ipod pushes the lack of a display that is on just about every other 
one in that price range.  If your really doing that, think it's cool, 
and like jamie's idea of throwing 2 or 3 records from each dj on it.  So 
then they can listen to it and go "I remember this song" or something 
like that.

wow, I've never seen you post on here, now I'm realy curious if you 
really took my remarks seriously.  Which for me is rediculous, 
especially on this list, I hardly ever say anything serious.  Maybe I'll 
put a li'l signature at the bottom that says the preceding email has no 
value and probably wasted pennies in its transversal over the internet 
into everyone's email box.  In fact I may come up to this, even without 
the open bar.  Heck, maybe I'll actually remember most of the night then :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday's lineup and new promos

I'd love to hear that actually.

I've also been toying of the idea of picking up some
ska records and putting a set together, but I need to
find a good resource for them (1st wave, two-tone, and
a few select third wave bands)  Anyone have any
resources for stuff like this on vinyl (they's pretty
much all be 7", I assume)

TIA if anyone has any suggestions.

That's what I was getting at...sorry if I didn't spell
it out.  It'd be amusing to see which DJ's didn't
remember their own records :P

you should hear when i put my ipod on shuffle......  goes from 
industrial to ska to rockabilly at times.   but usually hovers in the 
hardcore end of things.  one guy at work always points out when i put it 
in shuffle because "it sounds different"  or its not my "usual style"   :P

but yeah, those ipod shuffles are teh gheigh........   100/150 can get 
you a way better 512m/1g toy.... (think iriver?)

iriver is a nice little device...works as a nice portable hard-drive...my 
one buddy uses it to shuffle files between studios.

first wave stuff is repressed en masse on labels like trojan, soul
jazz, etc. theres tons of good old ska out there now, its quite
impressive. for second wave go to your local used shops, they
should have madness, selecter, etc in stock at one of them. for
third wave it might be harder, check ebay. i wonder if some shop
has a big moon records back catalogue in stock? its gotta be in
existance.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday's lineup and new promos

You truly believe you are so PPPPLurfect or what?

We are faced with two extremes here; 
Variety offered in the boundaries of the acceptable
and ridiculous ideas thrown with limitlessness ( sp ? )

Too many djs, punters, do not want this ever oh so wide variety that
you seem to offer as an alternative to what this night is going to be;
  and in most cases I think that involves a lot of you here present.

Multi-room event, lounge, big room, or spin it up in mom and pops
kitchen, you just can't go across all genres in front of a mixed group
of people when you consider their own personal favorites and
especially all in one night.
You and I have seen it, the kids will leave, bitch and m*an; heck the
dj before the other dj and the one before that will say What's that
that's being played?"
They want what they want and they wont take anything else.

Offer variety without any boundaries and you might just be faced with a riot.

Let's remind ourselves not to take this too seriously. 
It's a show not a party; oh wait I meant the contrary;

IT'S NOT A SHOW IT'S A PARTY!

But heck do I care;

I just laugh when I read most things posted here between:
5 comedians
2 debaters over their own graves
5 actual party goers
a couple list admins
a large number of lurkers
5 taking shit from everyone cause they're truly trying to push things forward.

( I think that pretty much sums up the type of people on the list
...... but once again heck do I care .... less then 2 weeks I'll be
living in another continent all together ).




Your irrelevancy has made my day.

And when you move to that other continent you will
soon find out and understand why those of us who try
to bring something else to the table get so
frusterated. 

For example, Jeremy Bible time and time again has
tried to bring in great talent and give these fokes a
taste of what else is out there - such as Legowelt,
Orgue Electronique, Bankok Impact, Ultradyne, etc. and
to no avail. Quite unfortunate really. 

So these mindless meatheads around here want their
hands in the air, cheezy synth stabs, and hideous top
40 vocals and nothing else? Well, they can keep 'em
and shove 'em up their green-drippin' butts. Meanwhile
this bitch will stay here at home and bang the Freddie
Fresh  and Drop Bass records to the kitties and be
damn happy doing it. =)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday's lineup and new promos

You just proved to me a great point I was trying to make; even if I
truly lost my lead.

Putting a totally pointless comment at the end of a message and see if
people would comment on that and forget the rest that somewhat made
sense; I think.

We have the attention spans of 2 year olds  ( I wonder how come most
of the "music" we listen to is in the 7~9 minute/track range ... these
producers I dont know what the hell they're thinking ) and the
jadedness of a grandpa who's been in 2 world wars and believe he's got
the knowledge on all.

We love going after the small details .... why????

One thing I can say about here; living in the area for 3 1/2 years; is
that quality is not what's missing; but bitch*ness is abounding.
People just can't be damn thankful.

On a brief side note, you mention Legowelt ....
but I did go to that show at B-Sides.
I'm not sure who it was; The first act after the "djs" ( doing the
worst mixing job EVER ); only thing I can say is I have rarely felt so
insulted by an "artist". All he was doing was playing one
preprogrammed Cubase sesssion and basically tweaking the EQs on his
sound board; I was quite BORED.
He did put brief variations in there as to say it wasn't all
preprogrammed but for the most part it was even less live then " BT's
Laptop let me shake my laptop and not see a single note change
Symphony ".
Btw, I did leave before he was over ..... I was already feeling sick
and this "sickness" of music wasn't helping ... I slept a bit when the
djs were playing already ( yeah right there in the B-Sides ).
( Was that "act" Legowelt"? )

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday's lineup and new promos

and how is performing with cubase any different than a hardware sequencer?
nobody programs on the fly...everyone that ive ever seen perform live is
just muting and soloing pre-arranged tracks...except for beet and bad
luietenant anyways(damn i murdered that spelling)...in fact...just about
anyone you've ever seen play a roland drum box live was probably just muting
and unmuting stuff...cuz only the 606 can switch between pattern play and
step write while in sync mode...there are exceptions...but ive got to say
ive never really seen anyone program on the fly...some ppl might play keys
and bass live....but if you cant play keys or bass, you are pretty much tied
to the sequencer.

everyones hatred of computer apps live(expecially sequencers)is just down to
ignorance...most producers are more than happy to get rid of limited
hardware sequencers for the ease and speed of a computer app...you never
hear anyone rave about how producer x used a qy-100 live....but thats
probably the only hardware sequencer out there besides the triton or mpc
that has the power of a computer app.

you need too see shawn rudiman then, ace. actually i think most
people ive seen use the 909 including jeff mills programs in real
time. you dont need to ever have it in pattern play, just keep it
in write mode and youre good to go. usually it seems people tap
things in then erase later.

an mpc is pretty interactive, so is the mmt-8 as we discussed.
youre still basically in the realm of using them to live arrange
things. 

and for synths, its not that hard to improvise some stuff overtop
of everything else. again referencing shawn's live set (still far
and away the best live techno ive ever seen) hes brought out his
pro 1 on many occasions for jamming on top of his sequenced chord
progressions. people can be as live as they want really.

>You truly believe you are so PPPPLurfect or what?

i believe i actually know music. this puts me at an advantage over
90% of the jokers out there who know about one genre and only for
the few years theyve been deejaying. i dont believe those kinds of
people deserve to be deejays. deejays should be like music
historians, you should have to have a degree before you step
behind the decks.

this is because people dont know music. good music sounds good
with itself. most deejays that i profess my love for i couldnt
even categorize in a single genre what they play. thats how you
know youre doing something right.

>They want what they want and they wont take anything else.

even if youre not talking about variety within a set, you can look
at planning a night as being a deejay in its own way. you need to
make connections between music and tempo that makes sense. for
example you wouldnt play dancehall right after a progresssive
house set. you might play it right after a jungle set though, that
makes much more sense. its all about showing some knowledge and
understanding of music outside of whatever stupid limits are
placed on it by today's club goers. 

>Offer variety without any boundaries and you might just be faced
with a riot.

again, if you dont know what youre doing, youre going to look like
a twat, whether youre a promoter or a deejay. and to be honest, if
youre booking progressive and breaks youre going to be especially
limited since those arent genres noted for their diversity in
musical influence. 

>Let's remind ourselves not to take this too seriously. 
>It's a show not a party; oh wait I meant the contrary;
>
>IT'S NOT A SHOW IT'S A PARTY!

i would never have breaks or progressive at something i was trying
to call a party. that just shows lack of musical knowledge.

A lot of people play live.  During out Midnight Mixer shows: 
Oozitron, Midwest Electronic Music Ensemble, Ben Kamen and Passenger 
Revolt, txt and deco, 2% Milk, Johnny La Rock and Mush Mouth,  Zone 
Music Inc., Detronik all played live electronic music right in front 
of you.

If they stopped working the gear the music would stop...

Only Ben Kamen and Passenger Revolt used a computer but then again 
they wrote most of their "patches" in Max.  They were interactive 
looping programs that captured the guitars that they were playing.

Come to think of it...www.experimentalbehavior.com is a forum 
dedicated to this topic...

these

what theyre thinking is that they dont know how to make a long
record. theres a huge difference between some crap progrsssive
track that goes on and on and on and on and on and on and one of
say tom moulton's classic 10 minute plus disco mixes from the late
70s. again this is because people dont know their music enough to
know how to make long records.

ive seen a bunch of those guys from the hague play live. they may
not be the best live acts ever but theyre still very good. however
i wouldnt expect someone like you to know why their music is good
since it references obscure music from 25 years ago.

Yeah, Ali G did that at one of our local civic arenas. The Salem Civic
Center has pretty quick escape routes. The people at the rodeo didn't
know what to think of his character, but exaggerated the near-riot
comment. People mainly just sat there dumbfounded.

Subject: {pb-cle} New Thread Based off of Old

A lot of people play live.  During out Midnight Mixer shows:
>>Oozitron, Midwest Electronic Music Ensemble, Ben >>Kamen and Passenger
>>Revolt, txt and deco, 2% Milk, Johnny La Rock and >>>Mush Mouth,  Zone
>>Music Inc., Detronik all played live electronic music >>right
>>>in front
>>of you.

Ok, I'm gonna take flack for this, but I'm used to it.  I've listened to a
bunch of these guys off of the midnight mixer website.  While it is
impressive, that they do actually make this music live, I have to comment on
the fact that alot of it seems to be lacking real substance.  I understand
the premise of being experimental, quite honestly though, most experimental
music bores me.  There's never really any direction or solid musical
grounding in it.  Basically, it sounds like a couple dorks fucking around
with drum machines.

I have a gig lined up in the near future..  All I will be taking with me is
a laptop and an RS7000.  The way I look at it is, I'm not there to be the
center of attention.  The music on the laptop is what's supposed to be the
center of attention.  Not to say that I'll just be standing there like a
stone fiddling a couple knobs, but I'm gonna keep it lowkey on the equipment
side.  I don't want to make a big production out of it.  Anyway, the point
is, if you want real substance in a Live PA act, preprogramming is a must.
Anyone who comes to see me, will hear the variations, the live mixing, the
effecting.  Won't be able to see it as well as if I was surrounded by racks
of equipment though.  The way I weigh it out is, your average vinyl DJ
doesn't have much more equipment in front of him than what I will have with
me.  Not only that, but what I will be doing will probably take more than
double the concentration.  Live PA DJ to me, is a DJ who takes control over
every aspect of an individual track.  Not only that, but effectively
transitions between each individual track without a break in sound.

When the music is made live, there seems to be a sacrifice in substance.

When the music is preprogrammed, there seems to be sacrifice in preformance.

Finding a balance is key.

I don't mean to seem like I'm tryin to out do Vinyl DJ's.  However, I do
feel that I need to be able to stand in line with them.  The sight of a
turntable setup  is stunning, as well as the sounds, as well as the motions
used to make them work.

Geez...you guys all bored Friday or what?  ....at least it took me until Sunday to look at all that.  
 
 
Speaking of variety.  I posed this question to a few people Saturday.  Anyone know any good live acts in around/Cleveland?  Kind of combo band/live p.a./electronic stuff maybe on the techno/industrial/electro edge? (Real specific there huh) That would cure my current boredom/need for variety I think.

Your viewpoint - forever etched in the eternity of cyberspace - does 
have some constructive criticism...

Only two or three of the live performers would probably consider 
themselves dance acts.  So if that is what you are looking for then 
you wouldn't find it in their performance.

Try the "txt and deco" recording for a more dance friendly act that 
was very live:

http://www.midnightmixer.com/media/displayimage.php?album=12&pos=21

As far as being experimental...

Artist are often not successful when trying something new or develop 
their own expression.

But many people are inspired by the effort more so than the outcome.

That is what got me into the "scene" in the first place - it was 
sounds I never heard before.

i love the way everyone makes themselves feel better about what they
play by throwing in the words "jazz"  "funky"  "soulful".

who plays hard house and acid jazz anyway ?  who plays acid jazz at all
anymore for that matter ?

wow.  that's a jazzy sportscoat you have on there ;p

you know, now that i think about it, maybe they didnt press (much)
vinyl since i dont have a single moon record on wax. thats just
about impossible considering how many of their bands shows i went
to at the time. i do have some skanking pickle stuff, but that
wasnt on moon....

Ebay.....I'm breaking the bank (literally) picking up
tons of records off there I thought I would never be
able to get my hands on... People are selling their
entire record collections (mostly from UK and
Germany/Belgium) on old out-of-print titles and
they're all up for grabs. 

You'll find such goodies as Messiah, T99, Sheep on
Drugs, EBN (emergency broadcast network),
Bizarre,inc., Underground Resistance, Praga Khan, Dr.
Fernando, Alphawave (original pressing), XL
Recordings, Sons of a loop da loop era, D.Mob,
Quadrophonia, lots of 50 or more Chicago house and
white labels from '88 onwards...blah blah the list
goes on. Some of these records are still sealed...

I'm still fuming that I lost the auction on 2 1991
Plus 8 recs - Hawtin & DBX: Vortex and Hawtin &
Beltram: Backlash  :|

the chicago traxx i want are all crazily expensive, like the old
westbrook recs, warehouse, muzique, target (jow lewis' label),
early dance mania, dj international, etc. people might sell them
but they go for crazy crazy money.

I'm currently in the process of categorizing all of
our records as I'm tired of tripping over crates up on
crates and spending 2 hours at a time looking for one
record... I know I have quite a few old releases on
Dance Mania, UR, Underground Construction, and Dirty
House - especially the Dj HMC titles. I'll have to go
through all of them and see what I have...

playing a drum machine doesnt mean you are programming live...you can do
alot of stuff with a drum machine or pattern sequencer with just the mute
buttons, level knobs, decay, snappy, pitch, etc...get what im saying.

 my experience with the 909 says otherwise...usually when me and jesse
jam...we set the 909 as master...and put the rest of the plastic boxes in
sync mode in step write...fun for jamming....but id never do it live...id
rather load up my machine with patterns and mix them live and actually have
a coherent set.

you guys must have had something set up wrong then. i mean its not
just me, everyone i know writes patterns live on the 909, no
presets, everything built up from a blank pattern. if you dont
think a coherent set is possible, go to
http://www.technoiraudio.com and listen to any of the livesets on
there by shawn ruidman or the lukes. both program the 909 live
(along with the 808 and hr-16 in shawn's case and the airbase in
the lukes case).

That's why you wouldn't use it as the master clock then..

This is all true.  Experimentalasm is needed for an artist to develop.  =
Develop into their own established sound.  I think really the point of =
debate hear is more about the live preformance.  Which is better, which =
takes more talent blah blah blah.  I think it's more about a person's =
mindset. =20

If your more of a control freak, you'll try and take on every aspect =
right there on stage.  Ultimately meaning, your music will be extremely =
repetitive and basic, or so scattered about it doesn't make any sense.  =
Now this is not a bad thing.  I've listened to Rudiman that Mr. Cox =
speaks of,and imagined seeing it live, and felt that I would be =
thoroughly impressed.  However, I would get bored.  I mean, I do have an =
attention span, but only when I know there's gonna be gold at the end of =
the rainbow.  If it just sticks around the same genaral idea,, I'm drawn =
to yawn a bit.  I think there's another side of the spectrum though.

Now, if you go out with a prebuilt arsenal ready to be manipulated in a =
multitude of fasions, you can actually give your adience an all out =
experience.  That's why music is great.  It takes you places.  Alot of =
these "live" acts, are more or less just good background music.  There's =
nothing wrong with that.  It does take alot of talent to program on the =
fly.  Lot's of concentration.  But there's limitations.  We're using =
machines because they do things we can't.  The bottom line is, me and =
anyone who approaches this around the same lines,  do create the music =
your hearing.  The details are crafted out in private.  It's the overall =
spectrum that takes life when we play live.

In the end..

Which warrior will come out on top?

The warrior who goes into battle with a premade arsenal.

Or

The warrior who goes to battle and uses his surroundings.

The answer....

It all depends on the warrior.

Ohigho is here.

Check the music section on my site.

www.thescythianproject.com/music=20

There's a whole bunch of it there.

Music that is.

You should all listen to it.

And maybe even,

enjoy it.

Thank You

John

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday's lineup and new promos

you know what, ive never thought of that, but its possible...i think the 909
was rolands first fully midi enabled drum box from roland...so its possible
the early versions of it had to be master for good timing...i doubt you'd be
able to do anything about the firmware rev w/o actually putting a new midi
chip in it...being that it came out in what, 84? i dont think you can flash
the rom via sysesx...you'd actually have to have an eprom programmer(if its
even an eprom and not just a prom) and get the code to do it.

i do wish i had a eprom cradle tho...that would be mad useful...especially
when i fuckup and put power on the wrong pin and nuke a chip.

ask around on AH or check their archives
there are people on there that can make eproms and have done it for ppl 
in the past.

Subject: {pb-cle} OT: Badger meter?

I ride my bike to work every day. I dare not park my Kona outside, I 
know someone would be pedaling away with whatever large object it was 
locked to. On dry days, I just put the bike in my cube, it's nice to 
look back when things get rough and think that work is what i do between 
rides. On crap days, there's a back closet I put my bike where it's cool 
for the snow and crap to melt off my tires and hit the floor.

With the oddity of snow on the ground in Columbus, today I parked my 
bike in the closet and noticed something I haven't noticed the many 
times I've put my bike back there.

I'm not sure why we're pumping cubic feet of badger fluid into the 
building, perhaps there's something about cable I don't know yet.

Better wrap your bike in tinfoil, and wrap you cube in it as well.  
actually... That may be kinda cool if the walls are tall enough you can 
make yourself a ceiling and have a little darkroom.  Then bring in some 
string to hang some little lights from and your cube would be da sheit. 
  They always say you should make your workplace as comfortable as 
possible.  Silver ceiling would really look neat if you had one of 
those eclipse lights that attach to the monitor and reflects light off 
the ceiling.

It's in cu. ft.  must be badger gas.

If it were gallons it'd be badger fluid.

Hasn't fleetwood taught you anything?

maybe there is an oxygen bar in a hidden room there, except they give
you badger gas instead of oxygen.  I bet that really pumps you up,

anyone know where i might be able to 'evaluate' a version of L0phtCrack?  

or know of a utility that is similar in being able to use a hash to
brute force decrypt a SAM password?

If you need it, Knoppix is probably the easiest route.  That is:

The Knoppix Linux distro burns onto a single CD, and doesn't really
need to be installed, just boot it from CD.

Knoppix can mount a Win NT partition.

mkdir /windows && mount /dev/hda1
cd /windows/winnt/system32/config

or 

mkdir /windows && mount /dev/hda1
cd /windows/windows/system32/config

in that directory, there's a file named 'sam'.  Copy it, just in case
this gets fucked up.

Then, change the password in the original sam file like this:

chntpw -u Administrator sam

Pop out the CD.  Reboot.  Should work.  If it doesn't, copy the
original SAM file back and try something like lofatcrack.

For that kind of work, I keep a Whoppix ISO handy... www.whoppix.net. 
It's the shiznazoslambama.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} OT: Badger meter?

Badger Gas bars are kind of like Oxygen bars, except there are multiple 
tubes that go directly into your bloodstream, for maximum absorbtion. Kind 
of like an I.V., except thats its better because we aren't talking medicine 
or no weak water... we are talking gaseous badger loins.

Has anyone here heard of a movie called ROCKY IV?

Or possibly an Ivan "I will break you" Drago?

Rumours have been stated that the latest and greatest russian technology of 
that time was in fact badger technology. Of course this was all an 
experimental stage, so it was still somewhat legal. Legal in the Operation 
Northwood sense. You may or may not have heard about this technology, since 
the badger technology of the 1980's was overshadowed by the "square tie" 
technology. I, too, sometimes have difficulty deciding which I enjoy more... 
badger gas or the square tie?

There is much speculation as to why Rocky "AY, I actually possess down 
syndrome.... AY!" Balboa won that fight... your guess is as good as mine.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

I've heard neither method is all that easy.  To the point they don't 
make any profit from selling, hence why such things are hard to come by.

Indeed I do.  Called the Auditor security collection.  Aparently the 
original company that developed went out of business and is hosted now 
at http://www.remote-exploit.org/  I only used it a little bit, and 
seemed to work good.  And not sure on the other distros, but this can be 
installed on the hard drive if you have an old laptop laying around.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday's lineup and new promos

Performers write drum patterns on the fly with a 909,
808 or one of the many Korg grooveboxes, and I'm sure
there is other gear with flexible on the fly sequence
drum programming.  

Many performers just mix in pre-written patterns, but
some customize beats real-time to fit a live musical
composition, which is great when performing with other
artists.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Konvocation, the top psytrance promoters in the DC / Baltimore area,
would like to invite you to join us as we celebrate our one year

for a night of psytrance in the nation's capital featuring 2 of
America's top psytrance producers and the bold nightclub decor
expected at Konvocation events.

As our thanks for all of your support, this party is free of charge.

December he was featured as the guest DJ on John 00 Fleming's Global

"Cyzum's a really really really great dj. One of the big standouts of
the year for me."

Featuring some of the finest and funnest (it's a word!) DJs and MCs in 
the NorthEast, including:

Dexyl (US) vs Sebby Bozak (UK Hard House)
Frisky vs END (Jungle)
Scoots vs Glow (Happy Hardcore)
Dirk D (US) vs Virus (Anything Goes!)
Baby Duck vs Tranzit (Euro)
Wolf vs Bliss (US) (Happy Hardcore Skratch Battle)
Apathy vs Gobstoppa (Gabber)
Tyco vs Kix (HHC w/ DnB)
Milo vs Andee Dee (US) (Happy Hardcore)
Xphox vs Dynamic (US) (Happy Hardcore)

w/ MCs: Rukkus, END, ED, Gobstoppa, ROC, and Loki

With fresh fruit, candy, and CD giveaways all night long, in true rave 
tradition!

Why the name "Tag! You're IT!" ? Partly because every set of the night 
is a tag set, which we at NC believes promotes the spontanaity (you 
can't spell it either Razz ) of real hardcore raving... but also because 
this is a Grafitti party! The FIRST Grafitti party in Toronto EVER! (It 
should be noted that we have made no attempt to confirm the truth of 
this statement. At all. Ever. ) So wear a white tshirt, bring a marker, 
and leave your PLUR book at home - at this party, we're writing on 
ravers all night! ATTENTION - THE WALL IS NOT A RAVER! IF IT DON'T MOVE, 
DON'T TAG IT! Thank you

Tickets will be available at Numb and 2 The Beat starting December 18th 
- tickets are 10$ CAD presale and 15$ CAD at the door OR if you bring a 
friend, tickets are 2 for 25$ at the door, so grab your buddy, sister, 
designated driver, heck even George Bush and save a few dollars! 
(Editors note: We charge extra for George Bush). Bars will be 
conveniently located near the venue - if you can't find one, just follow 
any MC. Wink

PLUR, ROAR, and VERYVERYDRUNK in full effect!

Jan 28-29                 BRUTAL CINCINNATI DAMAGE               Cincinnati

28+29 January 2005
BRUTAL CINCINNATI DAMAGE
2 days of multimedia anxiety and a benefit for Art Damage Radio.

This event will be an exciting collection of primarily aggressive work 
by artists in the Cincinnati area. Performance and non-static media are 
the focus, involving local noisicians, graff/street art representation, 
and extremities of punk, hip hop, and techno culture. Loosely, the goal 
for these two days is the production of a highly engaging, emotive, and 
physical compilation of work which can be accredited largely to the 
high-energy of our city’s least passive youth and arts community. All 
hypothetical monetary profit from admissions will go to the account of 
Art Damage for use in future events and/or disasters.

Subject: {pb-cle} Techs for sale

Yes...the time has come. I really have decided I don't need my turntables as
djing is not in my biggest of interests these days, and also...i need the
money. For anyone that knows me, they'll tell you my decks ussually get more
ussage by friends and djs coming over than by me.

If noone is interested in the next few days and contacts me, I'll put them
up on ebay. Feel free to drop me a line and ask any questions, or if you
wanna come out and see them yourself.

Here's what im getting rid of:


-2 Technics 1210 turntables MK2 (exactly like 1200's, but these have an
optional internal voltage switch for Europe)...very good condition, with
litteraly FEW scratches and marks, mostly on dust cover

-2 Shure White label catridges...both are less than a few months old, and
one of the styluses has seen litterally 15 hours of usage...these things are
fucking workhorses though!

-original 45 adapter, weights, pair of Technics slipmats, manuals, and I'll
even toss in 10 Trance records


$800/OBO....very reasonable price as is, but if noone has anything good to
offer Im going to ebay. I'm willing to drop them off to anyone within one
hour or so of Cleveland, otherwise they need to get picked up or shipped
(shipping is not gonna be too cheap)

Subject: {pb-cle} US Army's Gay Sex Bomb



Chemical weapons experts in the US army investigated producing aphrodisiac
chemicals to induce rampant homosexuality amongst enemy soldiers, the New
Scientist revealed this week.

The 'love bombs' were intended to deliver a 'distasteful but completely
non-lethal blow' to morale by making troops 'sexually irresistible to each
other' and were tested in 1994 alongside other chemicals which delivered
halitosis and excessive flatulence (apparently to help detect undercover 
enemies
and spies).

While Pentagon official Captain Dan McSweeney of the Joint Non-Lethal 
Weapons
Directorate told the BBC the love bombs were never developed significantly, 
the
project shared similarities with a similar secret weapon programme developed 
by
the apartheid era South African military, who produced over 900kg of top 
quality
ecstasy as a non lethal weapon (worth over US$200 million).

Top scientist Johan Koekemoer told South Africa's the Truth and 
Reconciliation
Commission in 1998 that he personally manufactured the MDMA for notorious
chemical warfare programme Project Coast, under the direction of the even 
more
sinister Dr Wouter Basson (also known as Dr Death). Dr Basson was later
controversially acquitted by the Commission, though not before he accused 
the US
of using hallucinogenic weapons against Iraq in the first Gulf War.

"I had good reason to believe that America used a BZ variant against Iraq 
during
the Gulf War," Dr Basson said in court. "Analysis of video material showing
surrendering troops emerging from their underground bunkers show that they 
had
dilated pupils, were drooling and had vacant stares. It appeared like the
clinical profile of a BZ variant," he claimed. (Ananova)

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/109853.stm  ('The South African 
military
was involved in the manufacture of the drug Ecstasy during the apartheid 
era,
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has heard . . .')

I dont know if any of you guys are into this kind of
music, but I love it..

This chick got ahold of me on myspace and asked me to
check out her music because she thought I had nice
taste er something. So I decided to check it out

Not bad.  I like this ambient electronica stuff as well and this is some 
of the better stuff I've heard.  Another person to check out is Yoko 
Kanno  (yep, more japanese).  Check out the Stand Alone Complex (Ghost 
In the Shell series for those not into anime) CDs.  Although she's 
really all over the board.  There's some jazz sounding ones and like 
heavy metal ones I think and then some really ambient dark stuff.

Sounds to me like this is nothing more than a "mediocrity meter."

I think it'll let you off at tower city (which is by public square)  and the only things close to there are The House of Blues, V-lounge, and pickwick frolic.   There's also a drop off point near browns stadium and the rock hall, which I guess would be the closest to W. 6th street...but still a pretty decent walk.   There'e another near the east bank too, but that's not close to much (maybe that would be a better place to walk up the hill to W. 6th)  No drop off on the west bank that I know of. 
 
It's ok to take to football games, and the st. patricks day parade and stuff, but as far as late night, I don't think all the lines run much past 12:30 and you could get stuck until  5 or so in the morning before they start back up.  
 
Personally I find it scary unless it's during commuter hours, I've been on it around 2 or 3 in the afternoon and there's some strange people....but I'm a woosie girl.

RTA stops most lines at midnite, but some run til 2am...so if you are
planning on spending a nite clubbing, rta might not be your best option.

pretty decent walk.   There'e another near the east bank too, but that's not

even get to the cool places this way? Any advice would be sweet.

Dude, seriously, props on the apple.  Never experienced the apple.  Anywho,

Can badgers be kept as pets?  Answer will tell:

(1) whether badgers can be reasonably domesticated as pets (e.g. won't
rip your arm off)

(2) is it legal to keep badgers as pets in the US or other countries

Rated:5 out of 5 stars

Badgers can indeed be kept as pets. The greatest success is had when
the badger is raised from infancy by humans. In the United States, the
legality of having a pet badger varies from locality to locality; many
urban areas have ordinances forbidding the keeping of normally-wild
animals within the city limits. Some states require a license.

"I have heard of people who have kept badgers as pets and despite
their reputation, they tend to be fairly laid back animals when hand
raised."

Post in Yahoo Zookeepers' Group
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/zookeeper/message/1115

"I've heard that badgers make good pets. You have to get them early,
though. In some/most states, you'll need a permit from the USDA or
USDI. I was unable to purchase one earlier this year because I do not
have the permit yet. I've talked with a woman who compared her badgers
to dogs, and said that hers actually got along with her dogs."

"Positives of Badgers as pets?
As with any animal you take into your home you will have a loving
companion. When raised from a young age they can be very docile and
devoted pets. Learning first hand about an animal that usually is seen
only pictures is a most rewarding experience.

Negatives of Badgers as pets?
You will have to find a vet for them. Not all vets will treat exotics
or should we say unusual animals. They do require a little extra
effort to take care of, being as strong as they are. I would not
recommend letting them run the yard like a pet dog or cat. They can do
some extensive damage to your yard by digging and tunneling. In most
states you will have to have a license or state permit to keep them."

Badger Tales
http://www.nidlink.com/~smoshea/pages/badge/btales.html

As a volunteer with an animal rescue agency, I urge you to consider
becoming familiar with the ways of wild creatures before trying to
raise a wild animal as a pet. You may want to volunteer at your local
zoo or assist at a "safari" type animal preserve in your area. This
will enable you to get a close-up look at the behaviors of many
species, and evaluate the possible drawbacks that may accompany a wild
pet.

Here's an excellent article about keeping wildlife as pets. This
article is specifically oriented toward Georgia, but the first
section, "A Guide to Legal Pets," is worth reading, regardless of
where you live.

............not if they behave like Koalas ( Koala bears to
Americans). My first pet Koala was not friendly at all and never
adapated to my family like a dog does.
 My first pet Kangaroo on the other hand  was a beauty and did in fact
become like a member of the family and behave somewhat like a pet dog
does.

 Living in the bush at one time or another in Australia,  a young boy
or girl has a pet everything that lives around the place. Most common
I suppose would be the big White Cockatoo that evryone knows( or the
pink version, or a galah etc)
 Quite irrelevant to your question of course so forgive my
impertinence here  for treading where I was not required

I was a young badger once... genetically engineered to have the unsuspecting 
dimwitted look of some white kid but with the ferocious killer instinct of 
the badger... suffice it to say, i have done my fair share of tunneling.

<<There is no way in hell you can trust gememi but hopefully a proper

Not for nothing, but since their relationship with Final Scratch, Stanton
has been attempting to make a shift from mid-range quality to high-quality
gear...perhaps this is Gemini's first forray into that arena as well.

Now, no one's saying that they'd ever pick a Stanton deck over a Tech1200,
but they're at least making an effort to not put absolute shite onto the
market, and I think that's worth something.

FWIW, I'd be interested to see what kind of price-point Gemini would put on
this:

I'd seriously consider it if it came in significantly lower than the Pioneer
DVJ-X1. 3g's is a bit much to handle....

Yeah, but a scratched CD sucks, too.
Hopefully they'll either find a laptop that never crashes or a CD that 
never scratches. 
And finally make a decent fucking decaf coffee.

in this day and age we have supercheap CDRs. if you cant keep your
CDs at least decently scratch free you can easily burn yourself
backups that take up next to no space. CDs are far preferable to
computer based "deejaying".

I went the fs route at one point, I will never use a computer to dj
again, too many things that can go wrong no matter what prog you use. 
 The way I am thinking these days, vinyl emulation is retarded, if you
want to spin vinyl then spin vinyl.  If you want to use a digital
medium then treat it as a digital medium.  It's easier to beatmatch on
cd players then it is on a tt anyway.

i honestly think that a technics version of this gemini joint is
the perfect combo of CD and vinyl. i mean im not entirely against
using CDs for playing your own tunes or edits or even things that
only get released on CD or MP3, but i personally wouldnt ever play
a set of nothing but that kind of thing. i love records, aside
from their general superiority in audio quality and ease for
deejaying, i just love everything about them.

You mean the technics cd player?  I have looked into that one and I
have drawn the conclusion that it's pants.  It's the prettiest one on
the market, I'll give it that.  I'm going with the cdj800 as soon as I
get the cash.

I hate spinning anything but vinyl but I really need to be playing my
own joints out and dubplates are a huge waste of money imo.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} interesting

I sold my fs system.  IT just didn't have the proper feel.  I will spin 
records when I want to spin records.  I like my synths analog, why would I 
think a mp3 would sound ok to me?  It was a dumb buy on my part and I won't 
do it again (and I love Rane).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} interesting

honestly, any cd player with pitch control is enough if you arent trying to
pull off any turntablist moves...most scratch dj's hate the pioneer cdj and
the tech cdj(from what ive read on various forums)...and from my own
experience, the pioneer is funky...it didnt seem to function like most cd
players(when i hit cue it didnt take me to the first sample on the track,
weirdness!)...i honestly think vinyl is on its way out...its a big expense
for the labels...as soon as a good cd encryption is figured out, i think
vinyl will go the way of the doh-doh bird, except for battle records
anyways.

I guess its where your heart is.  Like I said before, vinyl is artform.
Any wizbang can burn one up.  Hell, the new Dell desktops featuring
internet ready and cd burning technology will help you out!
It takes a man to press wax.  You have to know what your doing.
Ya either got it, or ya dont, and the people who dont USUALLY (like a wedding 
DJ)
spin and burn CDs.   It takes a community to support the scene
and this entails taking the long hard road and pressing wax.
Supporting pressing plants, distributors, and record stores 
(you there doug? still in business>?)
Supporting DJs that spin wax, not wedding DJs.
Now you know, the rest of the story.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} interesting

Yeah, I'm here.

There are a lot of things that could end up happening and it's realy quite 
hard to say what.  Quite frankly I am disgusted with American major record 
labels because they never have "gotten it" and I doubt the ever will.  Right 
now you are right in that vinyl does seperate the men from the boys and is 
the only true measure of a wannabe vs someone who takes it seriously.

In the clubs the last few year you have seen more and more laptop/mp3 djs. 
Interestingly enough I would say ALL of them are either a)newbies who 
thought that downloading a bunch of mp3 is an easy way to stardom or b)old 
jaded djs who are still broke and would rather not spend money on music. 
Either way neither of these types are healthy for the overall good of the 
scene.  Club owners have been stupid enough to fall for the noobs that know 
nothing about rocking a room, enteratining a crowd, or pushing forward 
music.

I agree that dubplates are a huge waste of money, which is why they aren't 
really used.  White labels, on the other hand, serve a purpose to a small 
degree. The drum & bass community really keeps their shit pretty tight with 
release schedules and promos.  They make sure stuff gets distributed 
properly.  Perfect example, take BBK007 which showed up on chemical or 
redeye for a total of 6 minutes before they were sold out.   We'll be taking 
the crapshoot of getting one copy at the store for the lucky person smart 
enough to pre-order it.  Do you think anyone with that kind of exclusivety 
who had to FIGHT to get the track in the first place is gonna rip it and 
stick their shit up?   That raises even more questions...

So for right now, unless you are producing your own music and KNOWN for or 
if you are playing tracks WAY in advance of anyone else, anyone who plays 
vinyl can be considered a serious dj and anyone playing mp3 is likely not. 
Then again there are those who arugue that djs are already too serious!

Tom got it right.

As the price of vinyl continues to increases and labels get their 
distribution even tighter, who knows what will happen.  When you end up 
paying $20 for one song, you won't be likely to fileshare it.  You know.. 
what if labels decide to do away with ASCAP/BMI/?THENEWONE? and include 
performance royalties in the cost of vinyl.

Vinyl remains as way to separate the men from the boys, the ones who "get 
it" from the ones who don't.

Really its sad when you think about all the people in the past fueling the 
record industry and they almost all did it for capitolistic reasons.

I think the majority had nothing to do with the art of it.  Its like each of 
them bought 100 records then jumped on some decks and thats it.  They don't 
have a solid base of music to build off of and it was frustrating for them 
that they got no play with there $1000 investment.

Fast forward to now and non of these kids buy music because the purpose 
wasn't to listen to music, it wasnt to enjoy, it was to make money.  That 
was the poisen that came into the scene in the first place.

Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah. BLAH! BLAH! BLAH BLAH BLAH!

Fuck if I care if the music is good. You're a poseur bitch if you can't 
go out and have a good time with someone playing music from a computer 
or whatever if the tunes are good. I've had a bad ass time in the 
grocery store listening to james brown dancing down the frozen food aisle.

And damn you trout for provoking the masses. If you were that bored, I 
could have called you and setup a yahtzee game or something.

Hmm. So I dislocated my knee and am on serious painkillers. Please 
excuse any crutch-shoving, mouth-running, or dancing to james brown in 
the grocery store escapades. Thank you,

Mike

Yah but they started dicking around with there tape and making it so it 
dissolves faster so they would sell more in archiving.  Serves them right. 
*Someone* will start making the tape if there is a market.

Oh sweet, I didn't hear about that.  I didn't expect it either.  I'll
prolly never have 3 grand to buy a set though :-/

On some of the other points...  I have enjoyed some cd sets lately, I
don't really care how you do it... but I still love vinyl and buy as
much as I can.  I'll probably quit spinning when they quit selling
vinyl (I think it's going to be around longer than some of you think)
It has been a dream of mine since I started spinning to have my music
on plastic.  A cd release will never give me that kind of
satasfaction.

Now excuse me because it's Wednesday and I have to get down to Milk to
pick up some new shit :)

Lets talk about the reality of the market.

Usually if I find a CD I really like, I will look for it on wax.  Just to 
have it.
I dont mind paying exorbanent prices for wax.  You get what you pay for.
I will love it and hug it and squeeze it.  I cant hug an MP3.
Exorbanent prices for wax may be a good thing.  Lets separate the men from 
the boys.
Let the little guys who "cant afford it" (not true to the art) play their 
MP3s.
And let the PROFESSIONALS support the weight of the industry, which is fine,
because they are an artist and understand that there is a backbone that 
supports them also.  These people in the scene (sorry to use you again Doug - do 
you 
have a family to support?)  usually have familles and guess where the bread 
and butter is coming from?

Fuck NAFTA.  Fuck Bush.  Fuck all these scum bags that outsource all our jobs
and manufacturing (do you think Sony manufactures cds in the USA? hell no!)
These are the true terrorist and anti-patriots, selling out their very own 
country to get
the goods a bit cheaper so they can drive their big over powered SUV up to 
the grocery store.  Fuck Wal-Mart too, fucking bastards.

I dont mind paying higher prices as long as its mfg in the USA and I know im 
supporting
my own people.  Did I mention fuck Wal-Mart?

Support you local record store    http://www.poo-bas.com
Support local pressing plants     http://www.europadisk.com
Support local distributors        http://www.wattsmusic.com

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} interesting

where did u hear that?  i have 40 year old ampex tapes in perfect
condition...i have 10 year old quantegy tapes in perfect condition...im sure
the people on the reel to reel group at yahoo will tell you the same
thing...the problem with reel tape is it when the user doesnt keep their
machine cleaned and aligned properly...when the head is built up with
nastiness it can really mess up tapes.

the chineese make tape, but its pretty well garbage...i guess with quantegy
gone, they'll probably figure out a better formula, or just steal quantegy's
with some reverse engineering.

well, at least the "people calling the police on you all the time" 
part.  Your not only on a first name basis with the cops, they know 
that it's you before they even get to the scene

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} interesting

im not talking about mp3 here...im talking about either home-made tracks
producers burn cuz they dont wanna cut a shitty plate...and legit
cds...thats why i said in my first post on this topic that vinyl will be
gone when there is a good way to protect the content of a cd

but speaking of mp3...there are places like beatport that cater to the dance
crowd that are selling legal mp3...if the artist is seeing some loot for the
mp3...whats wrong with that?  you gotta figure alot of the price of a record
is for the cost associated with making the record...cut out one of the
middle men, get more profits to the artist, the artist can make more music
instead of holding down a job or two to make ends meet...why not even put
mp3 in the retail marketplace...their are enough ppl with ipods or whatever
to have a kiosk at a record store just for mp3...plug in your ipod or other
mp3 player and you get the file...heck it doesnt even have to be an mp3
player...you could even stick a blank cd in there...and get a nice printout
with a tracklisting...it could work, but nobody has done it yet....its
working with photos, there is no reason why it cant work with music as well

there is an art to making a laquer master for a vinyl release...but after
that master die is made...they are just
stamped like cds...and if they arent stamped right...they end up sounding
like shit...how many records have you bought that sounded ok in the
headphones, and when you cranked them up at home u hear lotsa weird noise
cuz the vinyl was pulled off the press before it cooled enough?...and how
about all those records you bought, that came warped cuz they fell on their
side on their trip from the warehouse to the store? how great is that...when
i saw copies of "when the sun goes down" every one was warped...i really
wanted the tune, but i didnt wanna buy a warped record.(i know some of you
will say that i beat on my vinyl anyways, but i assure you all my vinyl is
sleaved up like it should be and on proper shelves now)

in the end...to me...a vinyl release is no different than a cd release...you
still get the content, in the same quality(everything you listen to is
recorded digitally anyways)with the same artwork.

will i quit buying records...probably not...when the option is there to get
a cd release instead of a vinyl....ill probably jump on it...its just easier
to deal with...why haul around 5 12"s for an album, when it can all be on a
cd? not to mention the cd release will be no more than 20bux, whereas a
whole album of vinyl costs what? 40bux nowadays?  everyone is crying how
cd's were supposed to drop in prices but never did...but nobody says
anything about the price of vinyl sky-rocketing.

"in the end the love of vinyl is down to nostalgia" -fresh(bad company)

let the flames begin

kinda sounds like my teen years in parma.

serious than skateboarding...believe me, id still be in jail if they ever

My boss is one of those audiophiles that got all bummed when he had to 
sell his turntable and stuff when they moved to the new house.  I guess 
he had some mad turntable with like a 3 or 4 inch platter, needles with 
the little brushes on them, etc.  He also has some sorta record 
cleaning machine that cleans it and puts an anti-static coating on it 
and stuff.  Don't remember if he said he got rid of that or I'd try to 
get him to do all mine.  Although i think he wouldn't enjoy it too much 
because he doesn't like the music I have.  He's said a couple times 
that the music I have shared in iTunes sucks.  Although i don't care 
for all his nsync either, so I guess it all evens out :)

(my 2 cents)
i would have to  disagree that its only nostalgia....every major label in 
the world produces vinyl still not to mention the smaller ones....almost 
anything that is released on a major label is also cut to vinyl and i dont 
believe that it's just for nostalgia...

where is this vinyl being sold at then?  the only stuff i see on vinyl that
isnt hardcore dance music is hiphop, club remixes of pop songs, punk
rock/indy rock, and reggae...and even these records arent at 90% of the
music stores...vinyl has become very specialised in the last 10 years...the
only thing keeping it around is the club scene(even with punk/indy and
reggae, the only reason this stuff is on vinyl is for the djs, cuz all of it
comes on cd as well)...when was the last time you saw a new jazz release on
vinyl or a soundtrack released on vinyl? there is a ton of vinyl out there,
but more often than not, the new stuff is on cd.

i dont know how many of you shop for anything other than dance or electronic
singles...but there is a big world of music out there, and most of it is on
cd, not vinyl.

im glad you all love your vinyl, i certainly love mine...im just pointing
out the obvious as to the future of music delivery.

btw, vinyl is pressed not cut...the master laquer is cut and turned into a
die for stamping.

K - here we go...

I happen to have Final Scratch, although I haven't
touched it in months... That thing scares me... It
never seems to work right. I've noticed Serato Scratch
to be alot better. I picked up the thing for the sole
purpose of being able to play friends' tracks, our own
tracks (which I haven't made yet :P)and for obtaining
out of print titles I thought I'd never be able to
find. But the thing is just a big hassle. 

As for CD's - hell friggin' no. I don't like 'em,
never did. I never even tried to play a CDJ-1000 - I
just personally don't think it's necessary. Ever since
my dad took me in the record store as a lil kid and
showed me a cd, saying "You see these?? These are
going to take records away. These are bad you hear
me!!" I knew to stay away. 

As for some broke fokes, well I'm a brokeass alot of
the time. I feel that just because you aren't raking
in the cash or you don't have mom & dad writing some
checks, doesn't mean you should'nt be pushing your
music. Yeah, some of us have other responsibilities, a
spouse, and kids to take care of. I'll tell you what,
I do whatever i can to pick up as much vinyl as the
account will allow (before being overdrawn :P) For
example like this month, it's either I let the
electric bill fall behind or I lose out on this 1994
release that I've been searching for. I think I'll let
the electric bill slide a lil bit - I need that record
and if I don't get it now, I prolly won't see it come
around again...  You just decide for yourself what's
priority - how serious you are about something. For
me, my records are my life's essence and it's now or
never...

Yeah, but what about tracks you've written, or I've written and you most 
certainly want to play out. (cough 
http://www.geargasm.com/sounds/1138-final.mp3 cough).

What about guys like adam that play their own sick choons? Aren't these 
the folks that really make our scene not a clone of a bunch of folks 
overseas? What about playing stuff that no one has heard before, or will 
probably hear again?

I certainly can't afford to press everything, and if you have to spin a 
local's tracks via cd, I don't think anyone will fault you.

<<where is this vinyl being sold at then?>>

unfortunately, not in america.

i found a fucking Dave Matthews Band album on dbl. 12" not too long ago.

he's right...most of it is still out there. just real hard to find.

<<when was the last time you saw a new jazz release on vinyl or a soundtrack
released on vinyl? there is a ton of vinyl out there, but more often than
not, the new stuff is on cd.>>

again, not in america, but a lot of it does still come out.

<<btw, vinyl is pressed not cut...the master laquer is cut and turned into a
die for stamping.>>

not that i have to explain this to you, nick, but for all the other folks
who don't know...this is part of why it's so damn expensive to produce
vinyl.

Yeah you're right there too. I suppose put it on FS or
Serato Scratch so it least feels like vinyl - stick
the cd in there upload it and there you go - I don't
know... I'm back and forth about the whole thing...but
I just can't get down with cdj's - it's just me, cd's
make me feel all dirty (in a bad way) or something
ewwwww :P Hell you all can borrow my FS for that
matter to keep the luxurious feeling of smooth grooves
if you wanna throw down some friends' choons =)

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

Jan 28-29                 BRUTAL CINCINNATI DAMAGE               Cincinnati

28+29 January 2005
BRUTAL CINCINNATI DAMAGE
2 days of multimedia anxiety and a benefit for Art Damage Radio.

This event will be an exciting collection of primarily aggressive work 
by artists in the Cincinnati area. Performance and non-static media are 
the focus, involving local noisicians, graff/street art representation, 
and extremities of punk, hip hop, and techno culture. Loosely, the goal 
for these two days is the production of a highly engaging, emotive, and 
physical compilation of work which can be accredited largely to the 
high-energy of our city’s least passive youth and arts community. All 
hypothetical monetary profit from admissions will go to the account of 
Art Damage for use in future events and/or disasters.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} interesting

I've heard this from more than one person with Final Scratch.

A friend of mine did a 12+ hour houseparty a few weeks back.  The entire 
thing was spun on Serato Scratch.  No problems.  No reboots.  No weird 
glitchyness.  It's more expensive than Final Scratch, but, ah, seems to 
be worth the loot, if you're up for that. Took me about a minute to get 
the hang of the interface.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} interesting

There is a slight delay and I've found that only touching the pitch slider 
works better then touching the records or platter.  I will say my djing 
suffered while using the system.  Little jumps and pops would ruin my 
measurement mixes.  Rane is god so I can see how thier system just works.

Nick S:  I got the information about the tape from the internet like I do 
all of my info.  I think it was only one type of tape they did it with and I 
don't remember the "model" number, sorry.  I did get the info from AH and I 
tend to believe alot of what I hear from that list.  You should join it. 
You are right about china,  If there is a copyright they will copy it.

27/01/2005

Civil liberties campaigners the Drugs Policy Alliance (DPA) celebrated =
this week after US authorities backed down over plans to make nightclub =
owners and music promoters responsible for their customers' drug use.

A provision in the 'Clean-Up Act' would have made it a federal crime to =
promote "any rave, dance, music, or other entertainment event, that =
takes place under circumstances where the promoter knows or reasonably =
ought to know that a controlled substance will be used or distributed", =
and could have wiped out America's nightlife industry.

"While there was much in the bill we liked -- it provided funding for =
safe cleaning of illegal methamphetamine laboratories -- we opposed a =
key provision that would have punished nightclub owners and music =
promoters for their customers' drug use," said DPA director Bill Piper.

"Well, not only did the CLEAN-UP Act not pass last year, but earlier =
this month a new version of the CLEAN-UP Act was introduced that does =
NOT even contain the controversial provision. This is an enormous =
victory for the Alliance and our supporters; live music fans across the =
country; musicians, club owners and activists; and the Protect Live =
Music campaign," he added.

So does this mean we'll have paramedics at raves (like those even 
happen around here anymore) like they do in Toronto?  doubt it.  Funny, 
I was talking to one at I think NYE and mentioned that having a 
paramedic in the states would probably get the place busted because 
promoters are thus assuming that someone is doing drugs.  And he just 
nodded his head.  And at a packed party where there was plenty of stuff 
going around, he only had to help one guy that was really drunk and 
puking and stuff.  Plus he said it's great because he gets paid to 
listen to music he likes anyway :)

A close friend of mine is an EMT (volunteer) and technically he's not 
allowed to be at a party in the capacity of a first responder, but he is 
allowed as a specialist in first aid w/ any identifying clothes, or name 
calling, etc.

Personally, I think it's stupid that the Man would give a promoter shit 
for having a medic on hand for safety reasons.  Talk about asking for 
trouble.  What if someone falls and breaks their wrist?  Or is hit in 
the head w/ random impact candy?  Those don't necessarily fall into the 
'drug bubble' of the diagram.

squarepusher and autechre records there like 2 years ago, and they
have some releases from moonshine as well.  go figure.  and i bought
the 'from the big screen to your radio' NFG 10" because it has the
cover of warrant's 'heaven' on it.  i love my cheese from time to
time.

/*speculating about Movement '05*/
Quoted from Detroit’s Metro Times: 
http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=7236 
<http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=7236>

*No Movement?*

As if we didn’t have enough hard hard techno news this week, we need to 
raise the question many insiders dare not ask out loud: Will there be a 
Movement Festival this year? There are just four months to the Memorial 
Day weekend when the internationally recognized event — called DEMF for 
its first three years, and then Movement in 2003 and 2004 — is 
scheduled. At its best, the event brought the world’s top electronic 
performers, media attention and countless “techno tourists” to the city. 
But we fear the city’s allegiance to the event may be approaching an 
end. Given Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick’s recent announcement of layoffs to 
deal with Detroit’s dire finances, the city may be too distracted and 
cash-strapped to support the festival. Usually the city green-lights the 
festival in January, and unpaid, stressed-out volunteers work until the 
morning of the event to pull it off.

When we casually broached the topic with festival organizer Derrick May 
at a recent benefit for tsunami victims at Oslo, he told us that the 
city’s commitment to the festival was such that “today there is no 
festival. ... Monday there could be a festival.”

We called fellow Movement organizer Kevin Saunderson to see if he was on 
the same page. And he was, more or less. Saunderson told us that he sent 
a festival proposal to the city last September, but wasn’t contacted 
until early this month. He described his subsequent contact with the 
city as “inconsistent.” We asked point-blank: Does he think the city is 
committed to electronic music? (We would have asked Lucius Vasser — 
Saunderson’s contact in the mayor’s office — the same question had he 
returned our calls.)

“The way they act it makes you wonder,” Saunderson said. “It definitely 
seems like they have other agendas.”

Saunderson said he wants to stay positive but he is not sure how a 
festival would come off at this point. He suggested that charging for 
tickets might be a way of saving the festival. Another possibility, he 
said, was to take the year off and pitch it again in 2006. We’ll keep 
our ears to the speakers

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} uh oh - new Cleveland festival


> *No Movement?*

Cleveland will have its own festival - downtown from Public Square to East
9th on Euclid.

>From the Plain Dealer Saturday, January 15, 2005

....

Ingenuity's Aug. 31-Sept. 4 dates apply only to 2005. Eventually, Levin
has said, he and Mulready plan to expand the festival to a nine-day summer
event that could tie in with University Circle's annual Parade the Circle
celebration in June, the Cleveland Orchestra's annual Independence Day
concert on Public Square or other events.

Levin has said that he hopes to see Ingenuity develop into a festival of
international significance and quality, such as South Carolina's annual
Spoleto USA.

....

Ingenuity will explore the intersections of art and technological
innovation, with a focus on diverse work by area performing and visual
artists, and scientific research groups ranging from NASA and the
Cleveland Clinic to high-tech entrepreneurs.

....

Levin and Mulready have been working for months to secure backing for
Ingenuity from corporations, individuals and government sources. The
project, estimated to cost $1.4 million in its first year, already has
been awarded $30,000 from Cuyahoga County's Destination Cleveland fund and
has applied for another $150,000 in county discretionary money.

I guess they figured cleveland music festival or whaever it was called 
was such a success </sarchastic> that they'll make a 5 day and just 
leave out the festival part.  Although I guess the xgames have been 
pretty popular, don't know first hand though.

I didn't think the city ever had any financial interests in it.  (well,
I'm sure they like all the money it brings in, but they don't pay for
it).  Although they provide the security.  but everything else is paid
by sponsors and donations.  So either a) they don't have any cops they
can spare after doing some heavy layoffs (which could be possible) or
b) they just don't want it to take place for some unknown reason.

As far as I know, the Cleveland Music Festival and Ingenuity are
unrelated.  Levin is the founder of Cleveland Public Theatre and Mulready
ran a popular performance arts festival for many years.  Mulready also
organizes "CoolCleveland.Com".

Also, I believe Cleveland lost the X-games for 2005.  And yes the X-Games
is very popular in both attendance and national media coverage.

3 Out Of 4 Mixmag Readers Dice With Death

Mixmag published the results of their annual drugs survey this week which
revealed that 75% of their typical readers admitted taking life-threatening
quantities of ecstasy.

"After a dip in popularity, ecstasy use has risen from 69.8% in 2003 to 75% 
in
2004," the British dance magazine declared.

"You take an average of three pills per session, the most you've ever taken 
is
nine and your longest pill thrapping (sic) session lasted three days," said
Maxmag.

The dance magazine's latest findings appeared as the coroner at the inquest 
into
the death of Irish teenager Gavin Duffy told the court that the 18 year old
youth had taken 9 ecstasy pills at a house party in Dundalk, before 
collapsing
and dying.

Louth County Coroner, Ronan Maguire revealed Mr Duffy had 'an absolutely
enormous level' of MDMA in his bloodstream, as well as extremely high levels 
of
alcohol (267mg per 100ml of blood) though recorded a verdict of 'death by
misadventure due to MDMA toxicity' (RTE Interactive).

Mixmag's survey also revealed that 11.7% of their readers have tried crack
cocaine, with 3.4% admitting to have smoked it in the last month.

Funny that the article doesn't provide figures of the MDMA, but does so for
the alcohol in his bloodstream....

I can't tell if it's the magazine being shady or the Louth Co. Coroner....

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP Free breaks mix for download

Please forgive the Blatant Self Promotion.

I'm a SoCal DJ trying to get my sound out.  My friend put together a 
site that allow DJs to upload sets and put their information on it.  He 
calls it "the Live Journal for DJs."

I'm on the site at http://waxdj.com/tlann  Please take a look.

The new set is a medley of breaks. It starts off with buttery funky 
breaks and slides into a harder urban sound. The urban influence finally 
relinquishes to a dark progressive motif. The set then twists into a 
psychedlic and acidey breakdown and finally closes with a bass heavy 4x4.

It is the set titled Medley of Breaks at the top.

So I finally put the title and song together for that mr. fingers
joint.  That tune always annoyed the shit out of me.  Why couldn't you
give a good example like doc scott - shadow boxing... done in one day,
rough mix down, played out the next day and the dnb cru STILL haven't
recovered from that massive bassline after 10 years.

Where you at Adam and Tom *flinches*

As good and effective as shadow boxing is.. I had no idea that it was 
done in a day.  But seriously, and you can flame me for this, but shadow 
boxing doesn't compare to can you feel it.  Doc scott jacked those wu 
tang samples, I just don't feel the inspiration in the tune that I feel 
in the mr fingers tune.

the original doesnt have the annoying "jack's house" acapella. its
a simple, minimal, electronic masterpiece that was one of the
first deep house records. shadowboxing is a fine tune, but that
whole 12" by mr fingers is amongst the best overall records ever
recorded in any genre.

can you imagine writing that bassline from "Washing machine"? how
do you ever touch a synth again after that?
