FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - distribute and spread widely



June 1,1998

                                Introducing...The New 1.8.7 -exit Joe,
enter Jordana

Dear Friends :


        Today I begin a new chapter in my life. I've decided to live a
happier life and part of that involves switching my gender. As of today I
am no longer Joe, but Jordana (pronounced jur-DAN-a).  I also have two
other big annoncements: the launch of my new website (http://www.187.nu)
and the fact that as of today I am releasing my entire archive of drum
loops, including ones used on my new album "Quality Rolls" to the internet
via the new site. But first I'm sure you're still scratching your head
about that "switching gender" stuff...

        Over the course of the last several months, I've come to understand
the source of years of depression, which on more than one occasion has led
me to attempt suicide. It has been serious but unknown to all but my
closest friends and relatives. More than just a realization has come to
light; I am now on a clear path to a far happier and rewarding future.

        To be more specific, I have a condition called "gender dysphoria",
"gender identity disorder", or, in more common terms, I am transsexual.
Simply put, my emotional and psychological gender, which is female, is not
in alignment with my genetic and physiological male sex. Experts believe
that this is not an acquired condition, but rather an intrinsic part of
one's identity. Despite all of the behaviors that I learned over many years
in an attempt to deny my feelings, trying to live in a made-up identity has
been a source of great unhappiness and pain in my life. These are not
issues that will simply go away if ignored, glossed-over, or repressed,
with any lasting success. I know because for many years I tried to do just
that.

        Gender dysphoria is relatively rare, but has been extensively
studied. There are internationally accepted standards that govern the
medical and psychological treatment, including psychological screening and
evaluation, psychometric testing, on-going psychological therapy, hormonal
therapy, and, often, Sex Reassignment Surgery (commonly called a "Sex
Change Operation").

        One of the major requirements in the treatment is that a person
live and work full-time, 24-hours a day, seven days a week in the social
role of their desired gender for a period of at least one year prior to any
major decisions, such as whether or not to proceed with surgery. This
period is sometimes referred to as "Gender Transitioning", "Real Life
Experience" or the "Real Life Test" and is a very sensible precaution. I
have been seeing clinical psychologist  and I am now on hormone therapy.
The time has now come for me to begin my own "Real Life Test".

        I officially begin this period today, June 1, 1998. My attorney has
prepared the documents petitioning for a court order recognizing the change
of my legal name to Jordana LeSesne and I would like to ask that people
begin using my new name and using female pronouns when referring to me,
though you may still call me Jo as a shorted form of Jordana. I realize
that habits--in some  cases of several years standing--can be very
difficult to break, and I know there will be occasional slips, which I hope
we all can deal with in a relaxed and good-humored way. Further, even
though I have come to accept my own personal feminine identity, I was of
course raised as a boy and I have much to learn about being a woman in the
world, as well as much to un-learn. So I must expect that I will be subject
to "occasional slips" as well--and hope to approach those in the same
dignified and good-humored manner.

        I understand that this transition will not be easy for everyone,
certainly including myself. I fully realize that some people may feel
uncomfortable with the change, but I do hope that we can work together in a
way that is as free from anxiety as possible for everyone involved. More
than that, I would hope that people put all this in the proper perspective.
While this may be a very big life changing thing for me it should NOT take
attention or focus away from the music. I've refused to let that happen for
myself and I would hope that you would as well. After all, music is the
reason we know each other in the first place. That said, gender shouldn't
be an issue. After all music, ESPECIALLY Drum & Bass music,  is universal
and transcends such boxes as nationality, race, gender, etc.

        I would be happy to talk with anyone about my situation. I would
much rather answer sincere, even perhaps very personal questions, than have
people labor under misconceptions or inaccurate stereotypes, either about
gender dysphoria in general, or me personally. You may contact me at the
following email address jordana@187.nu.

                                        *  *  *

        There has been substantial publicity about transsexualism, the most
sensational of which has been ludicrously exploited on trashy TV talk
shows. Obviously, such media are not exactly accurate, and are more often
just sources of distorted misinformation. However, there has been a lot of
fascinating discourse about transgender issues, and gender in general. Here
are some ideas that I have picked up and been able to relate to.

        Although clinicians classify gender dysphoria as a psychological
condition and have outlined a "proper" treatment for it, another way of
seeing the situation is as a SOCIAL problem which allows for only two
fundamental branches of gender: male and female. But just go out on the
street and look around you, and you can clearly see that there are many
ways people understand and express gender, from Riot Grrrls to businessmen
to ultra-femmes to B-boys. It's just that most people never need to
question which of The Big Two they fit in.

        But many people see gender as just another way of putting people in
boxes, and that often leads to discrimination the same way that race,
ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, or wealth do. In my everyday life, I
don't think of myself as suffering from a condition as much as living a
reality that few people understand or are willing to tolerate. I think that
is changing.

        So, what does this mean to you? That really depends on your views.
What's important to remember is that on the inside, I'm still the same
person I've always been. It's just that now the outside is starting to
match. I hope and expect that my identification as female will not invite
disrespect or radically different treatment. I am confident, because so
far, the indicators are good. Several promoters who asked to book me after
today were informed of the switch ahead of time--so far no one has
cancelled. Friends have been understanding, and collegues have been
forthcoming with frank and honest questions.

        I realize that I will have to prove myself to many of my audience
all over again. I am working harder than ever to keep producing quality
music and to provide entertaining live performances. Like many women, I
realize that I may have to be twice as good as I've been in the past just
to maintain the same level of respect I've enjoyed. I welcome this, not as
an invitation for public scrutiny, but a as personal challenge to continue
pushing my music forward. That is another reason I'm releasing my
collection of homemade and recycled rhythms. I hope that by doing this,
others will push the music in directions I never imagined.

        If you are still confused about this stuff please do check out my
website at http://www.187.nu or simply http://187.nu where among the
photos, audio and video clips and discography you'll find a section on
gender with more information on my situation as well as links to other
sites with more general information.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation,
Jordana LeSesne a.k.a 1.8.7

Herm, Are (were) you the same Joe LeSesne that I used to argue with on
"Chat Thing" / "Milliways" back in the early 90s ? I used to hang with
Sam Hopkins aka "Razor", I had handles like "Hot Rod" and "Entropy" I
forget what else...

Man those were the days :)

>        To be more specific, I have a condition called "gender
dysphoria",
>"gender identity disorder", or, in more common terms, I am transsexual.
>Simply put, my emotional and psychological gender, which is female, is
not

It's obvious that Darren and Sarah were making fun of the people who
don't support them, stupid.  I thought it was hilarious.  And knowing
Rich and Kelly's sense of humor, I'm sure they did too.  Lighten up,
already.  This rave politics thing is getting way out of hand.  It's a
stupid party, for Christ's sake!

Actually we did think it was quite humorous.  I considered making them for
Rich and I as well saying "SHOW ME THE MONEY!....(we only have one car)"

The DJ booth in the sky was made with Sasha and Digweed in mind.  They're
used to clubs so NGL wanted to make sure they were comfortable.  From now on
the DJs will be down with you guys where they belong.  I realize that it's
very important for the crowd to be close to the source of the music.  As for
security, that's also going to change for Rabbit in the Moon.  We're
counting on Digital Genesis acting as a springboard for a bigger and better
(believe it or not) Remixamatosis.  Your support has been incredible.  Mad
props to DAN KELLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I sincerely hope that Pat and John reconsider their plot to take people away
from NGL events by throwing renegades on the same night.  This has never
been done before in our city and to do it to an event that Rich is working
on is the biggest insult to the scene.  This is someone who has didicated
the past 7 years of his life to this scene (literally).  I think you guys
should be ashamed of yourselves...especially you John.  Rich has helped you
out a lot in the past and this is how you repay him? And as for the Deadly
Buddah fan club?  Joel {Deadly Buddah}(who goes back as far as Rich) thinks
you're wrong for what you're doing. There's no room for division in this
scene.  Seperate is fine.  But we should all work together as a city.

First, get a sense of humor. Second, try to stop whining.

Overall, I had an awesome time at this extremely phatty party! Only
two small complaints. First, the temperature was a bit on the hot side.
Not that they werent trying to do anything about it, there were fans
all over, and they even had what looked like a large air
conditioner going too. Still, kinda warm inside. Second, they need to 
expand the outside area a bit. The fenced-in area around the porta-johns 
degfinitely needs to be expanded by about ten feet in each direction so 
that people can hav a chill-out area without being so packed in.

i doubt that any renegade could reduce attendance at such a large 
party......i think that this renegade was an alternative for those of us 
who didnt have $20 lying around.....i RARELY spend $20 on a party, 
(barring driving to an out of state party) and i even didnt go to CHEER 
cuz i didnt think that the line-up was worth $20.....theres nothing 
wrong with throwing big parties, just making the party so expensive that 
it costs $20 is a bit out of line.....there are 2 more parties planned 
at the crane as far as i know.....i dont know what the budgets of these 
parties look like, but i know that i will not attend the june 19th party 
as long as it's $20+ and im still not sure about the july 18th 
party......i need to see what the finances look like around 
then.......im just saying that i think that $15 is the appropriate price 
for a one-room party, and that for $20 the one room should be so awesome 
that its insane.....and i dont feel that d.g. or remixatosis are worth 
$20......it would be nice if intergalactic circus's tickets were cheaper 
in advance.......its damn difficult to try and throw paties, dj, and 
still go to all the events in the area....

Just a brief summary on FORWARD.

pHryL. wants to thank everyone who came to Forward. There were people from
more places than we ever would expect - Philly, DC, Boston, NYC, South
Carolina, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Chicago, Winnipeg,
Halifax, Montreal are some of the locations that I can remember. We didn't
even have any flyers in most of these cities. The party went off better than
we could have ever anticipated. There were 2800 people there, 850 of which
were still left at 9 am.

Joey Beltram and DJ Skull for some unknown reason decided NOT TO BOARD their
planes. Joey was supposed to fly with Steve Stoll, and Skull with Mike
Dearborn. Mike was beyond upset with them (it was a Majesty tour after all).
In order to make up for their absence, he delivered probably one of the most
memorable techno sets I have ever heard for about 2:15 hours. And not be
outdone, Steve Stoll played his impeccable 45 mins set and added another
100% live and improvised on the spot 20 min set. That was a treat! 

Polyphonic opened from 9-11:30 with a very mellow and downtempo ambient,
with slow beats. When Green dropped Speedy J's latest release, the place
just went WILD. He went on for 1.5 hours, and then Kenny Glasgow (added due
to the no-show's) continued fueling the frenzy.

After Stoll, Adam Marshall did his part and Algorhythm fooled everyone and
took them on a crazy voyage with a very weird, downtempo, yet groovy and
deep techno set. Brandon (another line-up addition) was last on the decks.
He opened with the Helicopter track and closed with Spaz. 2 of Richie
Hawtin's masterpieces were perfectly placed and the people were just begging
for more as the loopy Spaz beats were winding down.  

The jungle room was... well, a JUNGLE. From Dominik, Everfresh and Unknown
Soljah tag team, Sniper and Mystical Influence's tag team, through Andy C,
Randall, Shimon, Red One, Fierce and Dieselboy the people were going MAD.
Hossam, please correct me if I'm wrong, but at least for me that was just
OUT THERE. And MC GQ's and Flipside's lyrics and pumping the crowd were just
awesome. The energy level was just TOO high in that room. GQ is more than
deserving of his "#1 MC in the World title".

All in all, we were overwhelmed with the great comments after the event. 

Once again, THANK YOU for coming (if you did) and hope to see you next time
(if you didn't make it this time).

Just as a reminder, our upcoming events include:

TECHNOPHYLE - July 4 at Industry in Toronto showcasing DAVE CLARK
PHUNKTION - July 10+11 in Cleveland (together with SHORTARM) 
NO NAME YET - November 28 - Toronto (1 year anniversary event)

We are also working on our last summer US based project (the third in the
pHunC/K series events) for early August, which will also be my farewell to
the Pb-Cle area as I moving from Erie. More details on that one when
everything is finalized. 

Check our web-site for constant up to date information.

Ciao,

Under a bridge, but not just ANY bridge.  It was THE WAY IT USED TO BE, 
UNDER THE WEST END BRIDGE!  And it was fun!

Okay, directions were kinda hard, because if ya ever drove there, there 
is a lot of ways to keep getting in a big circle!  Around and around you 
go, where is the party?  Anyone know?  But eventually you find it, by a 
Company, in a lot, under the bridge.

THIS IS WHAT I WAS MADE FOR!  Originally made in Pittsburgh, never moved 
anywhere else, The Ultimate Machine smiles kindly, and Cyborgia 
protected us from being busted!

All of us DJ's got to spin, and even though I got around to it by 4:00 
a.m., a lot of people still hung about and around, and yeah, my best
friends were all their too.

A little note to our so called BIG WONDERFUL DO NO WRONG OUT 
THERE---BACK OFF A LITTLE HUH?  Rich and Kelly, stop FLAMING!  You are
bitchier than I am and that is pretty much hard to do.  I thought I was 
in major attack mode.  Hell, you guys won't leave it alone!

That goes for Darren calling Pat a Cunt.  4 Get you PAL!  I don't spin 
for shady bithy people who know that what we did was so much better than 
you could ever do.  Stop with the nuclear weapons already!

Anyway, it was beautiful.  No one came and told us to go away.  All I 
could see was the lot the bridge and a lot of happy people with a lot of 
good music.  The only thing out there that was curious was a boat, and 
it shown its lights on us, so I turned the sound down, but it went away 
and we were fine.

I felt protected the whole night through!  It was safe, secure, and it 
felt like being in the back lot where we used to go.  Hardcore happy and 
hard played!  Jungle and deep trance, and a common love of being 
together too.  i OFFERED FRUITOPIA!  POP TARTS!  Get that from a $25.00 
rave!  Good luck.

Thank you all for coming.  Hope to see you next time very soon!
DJ K.A.L.I.  :)   K. Adds Lights Immediately

   First of all the remarks about Sarah and Darrin were not made without a
reason.  They booked Electric Skychurch without knowing what they sounded like
or even what style music the were.  That's why we said she knows nothing about
music.  They only booked them because they are a big name that will bring a
lot of people and that tells me that they don't care about people having fun
and they're in it for the money.  I think the scene should be all about fun
not about money.  All of the sound and the generator for the renegade was paid
for aut of our own pockets.  We were having so much fun at the renegade we
didn't even want donations and did not collect any.  Do you people see what
I'm getting at?  I think they try to buy everyone out.  They tried to buy me
out by promising me a booking at one of their parties with one of my favorite
DJ's (clarkee).  From what I understand Darrin told 7up he would pay for his
CD release and once he got the bill for the CD's for around $1700 Darrin
changed his mind and decided not to pay for them.  And as for me selling my
ticket to DG.  If I would have went there I would have been refused entry at
the door anyway even though the agreement was that I would have been able to
go in at 5:00 am to promote the renegade as an afterhours but on the list next
to my name it said "do not let in".  Instead of me going I sent someone else
there with the flyers and it was promoted as an afterhours.  And as for
Darrin: I don't have time to type about him.

If you need anymore info about anything you can call me at home.  my phone #
is (412)431-4085
Or you can stop at my work and we can talk over a burrito.  I work at PoLLo
Rey on Forbes Ave. In Oakland

Keep it real

jo...

*wow*

first off, let me complement the way in which you structured that message. i'm
sure you spent a good bit of time planning how you were going to tell all of
that, but, in my view,  few people could have done that good of a job
addressing a subject such as that with the openness and grace that you have...
damn. man, i don't know what to say.

...well, until i think of something,  :)  let me just say that i think that its
great that you are doing what's right for you. i'll leave it at that until i
see you again in person, but i'm behind you all the way.

pushing the topic of gender aside for a moment, i also wanted to let you know
that i've been meaning to get ahold of you for a while to discuss some
music-related things in detail. i've been exposed to a lot since we last played
together and definitely have been wanting your input on more than a few things.

oh yeah... about the video from the graffiti show and from steelcity, it,
unfortunately, was stolen a week or so back... i had just gotten the tapes back
from mskw1 at subphunc 27 and somebody decided to rip off my backpack, which
had the tapes inside of it...  :(   i have a few vidcaps that i made a while
back, but that's it.... i'll see what i can dig up though, k?

that's it for now, but once again, take care and good luck with everything.

to new experiences,

    --spike

i don't think kelly has been flaming at all...she's simply responding to
comments and accusations in the same tone they were originally presented
in...if people make snotty comments, you should expect snotty answers...

and if anybody has been elevated to a godlike stature of "BIG WONDERFUL
DO NO WRONG OUT THERE" it has been john/HOS...not that i'm arguing that
he/they don't deserve it; i think HOS deserves a huge amount of
respect...i just think your perspective needs to be checked...

and finally, i think it's people on this list, rather than rich/kelly
that wouldn't leave it alone...where were you to tell people to back off
when the negative speculation about DG was going on?

  
> That goes for Darren calling Pat a Cunt.  4 Get you PAL!  I don't spin 


i think it's already been established that this post was fake...that
wasn't darrin...it was someone else who forged NGL's email address...

digital genesis was fucking awesome.
I got there around 5pm trying to get a pre-sale or to help set up (hehe
didnt work). But whatever man it was worth the 25$
Blew the hell out of the last party i went to.

The water did taste like crap and they should have had running water. I had
no money for water but when I went up and asked for a water because I was
really thirsty the girl working just gave me one.

Electric Skychurch was fucking insanely awesome, my friends went and hung
out with them after their set. 

After the party i was dIRTY as hell, should have swept that place out. 

Did anyone else fall in love with the massive white evaporative fan? That
thing kicked.

Yeah they did turn it down, like around 3-4am... somewhere in there

7up was okay.

Whenever i was inside during Sasha and Digweed I had to dance, really good
set.

I went to leave around 8:45am, my car had a fucking flat. So i heard most
of kevin's set, then got my car fixed (fix-a-flat) and headed off to the
west end bridge for the after party. 

Afterparty was cool, not many people though. I was mad cracked out and
tired and hungry. Got shut down about 15min into Noah's set (red headed
step child). What was up with the mixer at the afterparty...?

Hey if anyone saw me, im about 6' white short white dreadlocks, had jnco
shorts, khaki, with big pockets on the side and a DIRTY DIRTY white nike
t-shirt.

Overall awesome fucking night. Waiting for the next party at the Crane.

Thank you so much for the encouraging words.
The T-shirts Daren and I wore were meant to be fun. You missed my
sister's t-shirt that said 'I am an artist I have no self esteem" she
does our art work. Daren's brother had one that said "Imported Tosser
[jerk-off] (I am with Mr.Charley[cocaine])" on it 

I am wondering why Pat Friend didn't approach me or Daren if he saw us
at DG. I was trying to talk to everyone while trying to make things run
smoothely for everyone. I am glad that we were successful in throwing a
party people enjoyed and we have noted the problems with running water
and dirt. 

John Brommage came to help Trevor @ Hypervinyl at the beginning of the
night. He assured us that he wasn't spinning at the Renegade.  I do not
want this repeated. Our party was splattered with SHINE flyers and its
not that it was a party on the same night, but a party against a party.
It was not an after party if was happening at the same time the main
acts were going on at DG. People were dissappointed taht there wasn't
any afterhours after the main party. If Pat had thought about including
everyone he would have held SHINE after the party and got more people
there. Even we would have promoted it for him, because it would have
been in congruence with ours. We would never had done such a thing to
anyone.

Why the maliciousness Pat Friend. We are trying to work with everyone. 
I talked with Artistotle from Local 13 along with a lot of other
promoters who came from far off places and they told us not to give up.
We tried to go all out for everyone at DG and still we have Pat vowing
to promote vigoriously against us. Is this the face of the Rave Scene?
We gave Pat a VIP invitation and he sold IT? 

I need to know from you guys out there what to do. Are we the devil that
everyone made us out to be for the last few months.   

We don't want to monopolize the scene. We want help people and the scene
by making it bigger, and making Pittsburgh a name, not just a venue.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this can only help people like House of
Styles and Pat Friend.  What can we do to convice you of this?

A report on the talent:
Sasha and John Digweed were very quiet guys. Jimmy was droppy and tired
after missing his flight. It was him who request that we treat  S&JD to
a booth separate from the audience, AND YOU KNOW WHAT S&JD!! They wanted
to be down there with you guys. They would have liked to see your faces.
That is something we will change. I had the toughest time trying to work
that damn elevator thing anyway. I am definitely not a mechanical person
and I still know nothing about music :>

Electric Sky Church are the nicest and most friendliest people you will
meet. They are what you call TECHNO HIPPIES. There was even a group of
people that came from way out west to follow them here. 

Both groups said they will comeback. The space had just had construction
done to it adn they were leaving as the lights and sound were being put
in. We do plan on hosing the place down.

The Crane space is a big space to work with. If you guys who saw the
space have any ideas, please tell us. I want to make a bigger outside
space. The dork from the fencing co. didn't give us enough fencing. The
air condititioning thing was Daren's idea.

A Big Thank You to everyone involved with DG and who came. I had a great
time talking to people and handing out doughnuts. Thanks to Rich and
Kelly who didn't give up. 7up, Zemo, FiveStar, Midnight Blue, Wizard
Workshop and the people who worked for us. Joshua Ryan aka Opus is
awesome. He came up to the booth to meet S&JD who use his record quite
often. they were delighted to meet him. He is something PGH should be
proud of. There is a lot of great talent here that doesn't need to be
wasted or forgotten. Kevin wound the night up great and we are excited
to use the people around us because they kick ass.

Sarah Lolley

Oh by the way Daren blew his top and called Pat a little cunt.
No one can came to Daren to talk about their differences or how they
didn't like his t-shirt, that we went to great lengths to create so I
don't blame him for being a littlepissed off with the whole thing.

Come on guys lets make this thing big, don't work against it.

DEAR PAT FRIEND

WE KNEW ELECTRIC SKY CHURCH WAS AWESOME!
I have been workingout to their CD for awhile. My sister introduced me
to them long ago. Cameron did PR for the group. AND WE NEVER BRIBED YOU
BY ASKING YOU TO PLAY. I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE. 

WE GAVE DAVE $1000 as a gift for the production of the CDs. And that is
none of your business. Are you jeolous or something PAT? Sounds to me
you don't get enough attention.

He are trying to be fair to people by paying them for services we can't
do ourselves. We made no money off Dig Gen. The money as I say again was
my college fund that can only be reimbursed if we keep throwing parties.
Who are you kidding Pat. This is getting ridiculious. If you were going
to make your party an after hours than you should have started it as an
after hours. You had that party well organized time wise before the
night. 

At the door we had a note posted by your name that said SEE DAREN. We
wanted to sort things out. I am a reasonable person and very hard to
piss off, but you take the cake. I do not have to please you with
explanations that are unnecessary! 

I officially don't care what you say anymore. Talk all you want. I think
you have a complex.

pat did not attend d.g. in any way, the shirts were reported to him from 
unknown sources......

i was with john and trevor when they were there, adn quite frankly john 
was treated quite badly by all involved even though he came on good 
terms.......(i was the person that i think it was you who said that i 
look like the guy from fuel:)

i have a few questions about this.....why were some of you (sarah 
included) spying on the renegade???? i (as well as others) saw 
you....that was rather sahdy.....i also heard that the bouncers from 
laga/attic were at digital genesis.....why did they appear at the 
renegade also??? and im positive that at least trevor promised that he 
would spin at the renegade duing afterhours, and that this was ok'ed 
with the promoters.....now, knowing that at least one dj was spinning as 
an afterhours for your event, why did you not promote it?? it was going 
on, and you knew it, yet you did'nt tell anyone about it because of the 
fact that it conflicted with part of your party.....the renegade lasted 
until the mid afternoon, and if anyone missed out on it, it was not due 
to lack of effort by the dj's who spun it as a afterhours, or the 
promoters of the renegade...


>Why the maliciousness Pat Friend. We are trying to work with everyone. 
>I talked with Artistotle from Local 13 along with a lot of other

local 13 sold 8,500 tickets for a 5000 person venue  at a party where 
someone died.....they do NOT count as responsible promoters......

>Correct me if I'm wrong, but this can only help people like House of
>Styles and Pat Friend.  What can we do to convice you of this?

okay, here's what i think about this....as far as i kow, there are at 
least 3 more $20+ parties planned for the duration of the summer....now, 
there are only so many people in the rave scene in pittsburgh, and they 
only have so much money....how are they to afford going to all parties 
and clubs when there are so many high-priced parties??? of course thyre 
gonna choose to save the money they were gonna spend on a little party 
when they can wait 2 weeks and see rabbit in the moon, keoki, metallica 
etc at the high-priced party....i dont think that you are out to destroy 
the underground, but that is what will happen...theres only so much $$$ 
in the scene, and theres notenough to supp ort the underground AND the 
big parties that you guys throw and will hold at the crane.....its 
economically impossible...thats where the beef comes from....h.o.s. cant 
just say "here's 25,000 to throw a party" that can compete with the 
lineup that you guys can.....none of the little promoters will be able 
to survive if these parties come in such a rapid fire manner....you may 
increase the scene, but you will lose the underground and then 
monopolize it....  

>Oh by the way Daren blew his top and called Pat a little cunt.
>No one can came to Daren to talk about their differences or how they

>don't blame him for being a littlepissed off with the whole thing.

that is absolutely rude, and intolerable...i cant believe that this 
comment would EVER be necessary......i definitely think an apology is in 
order here......


>Come on guys lets make this thing big, don't work against it.

that is the viewpoint of  capitalist....sorry, i dont agree with 
it....the best times i have had at a music event have happened in 
basements, at shows i paid $3 for, and the money went to a charity....i 
think that partys that focus too much on the lights and sound are 
missing the experience that can be had by the rawness of music.....thats 
why i dont like corporate rock shows, and i go to punk shows.....i think 
that the important artists/dj's arent those who record for moonshine 
records or other labels like it....the true cutting edge is in the small 
basements and under bridges....thats where all scenes come from, and 
thats where they should remain.....i understand that everything will get 
commercialized at some point, but there still needs to be room for the 
underground....without the underground, the scene is nothing but a 
prepackaged product.

parties??? its not healthy fo other promoters.....i hope you all see how 
this can become detrimental to the scene in pittsburgh.....bigger cities

in no way could ever have detracted from your party....you guys need to 
chill out!

this is the only point i feel like arguing:

there is! there's room for EVERYBODY! there's no use fighting to keep
the scene underground by making it a underground vs. commercial war.
and the only people who don't realize that are you, pat + kru.
downlow/ngl aren't tryin to stop you from bein' as underground as you
wanna be.

>...without the underground, the scene is nothing but a 
>prepackaged product.

there's room for both, and if both continue i'll be a happy guy.

ss/shy fx/warren g are coming this summer... no they aren't
underground anymore, but are they part of the prepackaged product that
you are talking about or what? is there no room for their talents in
pittsburgh because of a desperate attempt to keep everything
underground?

OK, I wasn't trying to step in this arguement cause I got work to do, but
here goes:

Tom: you want this Utopian "underground" wherein everbody can go to every
party for a very small amount of money, but in reality who is this good
for?  A small  group of people who enjoy small personal events and don't
want to bring in big acts from other cities.  Now, sure that's what you
want, and that is fine, do that . . . BUT you don't have the right in any
way to tell everybody else that they shouldn't have big scale parties and
bring in people from all over the world.  I mean, the majority of the
people out there want to go to a big, grand-scale, lasers shining, system
booming, big name DJ having kinda party.  This type of party promotes
growth in the scene.  Sure that may mean some normal people into the
scene . . . but weren't you a "normal" person just under two years ago?
Without large events the scene will grow stale and die.  In your
anti-capitalist statements and seemingly more communist type of ideas you
are forgetting one thing: capitalism works and communism doesn't (In
general).

And you are wrong about people not having enough money.  In a matter of
two weeks there are many ways to get $20.  It is no problem with somebody
that has a job, and most others find ways as well.  In reality large
scale events will help out the smaller events because more people will be
aware of what is going on with the rave scene and as a result support the
smaller parties as well.  OR the other possible outcome is that nobody
will go to the small events that aren't "down with the underground" and
then you will have what you want anyways . . . small intimite events
where people know what's up.  Also once these "$20 parties" continue for
a while, if succesful the prices will lower because attendance will
increase, thus lowering cost per person.

Regarding HOS not being able to dish out $25k, then why is it that the
last HOS party cost the same amount as intergalactic circus?  The two
possible answers are that 1) HOS is not giving you the same quality
entertainment for the exact same price, meaning that John is ripping
people off or 2) HOS is on the same level commercially as NGL is

Which one is it?

I think John's intent has always been to throw large scale events that
pgh has never seen the likes of before.  It seems that this is the same
goal of NGL, but because you don't know NGL personally and because you
are so afraid of Big Brother and the evil capitalist you won't support
them.  The only difference is that NGL is starting out with a large sum
of money from sarah's college fund and whatever other money (I don't know
the specific's of what other money was provided) and John started small
by saving up money working at the "O".

>that is absolutely rude, and intolerable...i cant believe that this 
>comment would EVER be necessary......i definitely think an apology is in

>order here......

I've heard much worse things than this from people i know very well ;)

>that is the viewpoint of  capitalist....sorry, i dont agree with

>that the important artists/dj's arent those who record for moonshine 
>records or other labels like it....the true cutting edge is in the small

>basements and under bridges....thats where all scenes come from, and 
>thats where they should remain.....

Why do you have the right to say this?  What makes you god of the scene?
And regarding commercialism, the extreme majority of the labels that any
jungle or hardcore DJ buys are from huge English companies that are MUCH
more mainstream then NGL could EVER be in pgh.  Does that mean that we
should not buy records from them . . . . I don't think so.  But that's up
for you to decide for yourself. 

>commercialized at some point, but there still needs to be room for the 
>underground....without the underground, the scene is nothing but a 
>prepackaged product.

True, but without the commercialism progress is impeeded and variety is
lessened, often making the scene stale.  Its all in the way you look at
it.

;) todd once again flexes his superiority over tom ;)

seriously-no disrespect is meant by this post, but I'm just trying to
discuss some serious issues and differences of opinion . . .

(from the previous things I read I thought it was wrong for them to say 
what they said.  I responded forcefully, but if they turned around okay, 
maybe I was sorta bent out of shape.  I mean I thought DOWNLOW woulda 
killed all of us or something.  Those things they wrote were the worst I 
ever read on this list.)

(Well if all is cool now, ok, I just didn't like the Flames, Whines, and 
Moans I read from their posts.  It was wrong and I responded as such.  
If things are good than I am good with it too.  I don't wanna hold a 
grudge or have people slam other people, but if it comes to it sometimes 
I have to join in.  I just didn't think a lot of what they
said was very nice.  I don't want any DJ's to be black balled that isn't 
right.  Nor to say you can't work with so and so because we tole you 
to.)  

See ya soon Pat, thanks for the invite!
DJ K.A.L.I.  you know the rest!

Will you people get off it already? This is complete bullshit. I found the
horoscopes more interesting than this. Honestly guys, Im no rocket scientist,
but all this flameing each other over a mailing list isn't making matters
better. Couldn't this be taken else where, like a more intimate situation or
something? Just an idea I thought Id throw at you.

and someone called me an idiot...HMpF..

i don't know, but i think your personal loyalty to pat friend and
company is giving you tunnel vision and preventing you from seeing the
whole picture.

darren's 'cunt' comment and sarah's recent posts didn't come out of the
blue...they aren't maliciously making comments for no reason...if i
remember correctly, pat was the first to fire an insult this time, by
making negative remarks about darren's and sarah's shirts...people are
telling kelly and sarah to chill out, apparently forgetting that they
themselves were part of the trash talking that created the animosity in
the first place...

it's like if i called someone an immature piece of shit or a
money-grubbing bastard (in a public forum no less), then told them to
chill the fuck out when they tried to defend themselves...

>WRONG!!!!! dont make me go to the archives to disprove this!!!!


actually, could you find the post you're talking about or tell me around
what date the messages were posted? i would like to see it (seriously
and absolutely no snot-nosed implications on my part)

btw, i think your point about noguestlist being too big of a production
company certainly has some validity to it...i'm still undecided as to
whether constant big events will have a detrimental effect...however,
something to keep in mind would be that i'm sure a large number of the
1,300 kids who showed up saturday night were not from the surrounding
area...meaning bigger events don't have to rely solely on the local
crowd to be successful...big names will attract kids from other
cities/regions...

also, the point you mentioned that kids would be drawn to the big events
and not have enough money for the smaller events...like i said, a very
valid point...however, (and i know we definitely won't see eye-to-eye on
this next one; considering your views on capitalism and considering i'm
a business major), no one is forcing the kids to make these
choices...they are made according to the preference of how they want to
spend their money...so if what you said actually happens, all it is
would be kids getting what they WANT...it would mean that overall, kids
prefer big names/events to small ones...if there are people who prefer
smaller events, those events will survive...if they die, it means that a
majority of people would rather have big events...the consumer is king...

and the underground will never die...it will always be there...

don't know if i made any sense,

jeff

Kelly there was no wrong in what ANYONE ANYWHERE was doing!  This was 
like a seperate room only outdoors.  And what you said about us was 
wrong, they have no right to access Paul Morris or BML?  Pretty mean
fighting words at that!  

I really don't think this kind of situation will happen again.  It was a 
big thing, yeah, two parties one night, but not all the Renegades will 
be like that.  

You called us the Rebelgade told us we can't play for you ever.  If you 
want to work with the whole city in mind, take a good close look at some 
of the stuff you wrote on this list.

If one little thing like a Renegade is gonna ruin your life, maybe I am 
better off not playing for you.

Are you kidding? Sure, some of the people can't afford to go to all
of the parties, but just think about the amounts of money that are
passed around Inside the place. I would bet that more goes on
inside than at the door. Like it or not, that's just the way it is.

Logically, you are wrong. If the underground parties are only going
to be $3 anyway, who can't scrape up the money to go? Really,
if they're that underground, they should be able to handle letting
some people in for free.

I've been to parties where no amount of lights could save the vibe,
and I've also been to parties where the only lights were coming from
kerosene heaters and had an awesome time. It's the people who
attend and the djs who make the rave good or bad.

I really think it's impossible for anyone who's never worked on an event to
comprehend the money that goes into one.
DJs-Big acts can be $7000 or more-that would mean that at $20, 350 people in
the door would be paying for that act.
Normal headliners range anywhere from $1000 (if you have connections) to
$3000
 space-I'll use the Irish Center since I think it's day has passed.  I
believe they were charging a few hundred dollars to rent it when Turbo Zen
used it in '93.  Now it's well over a thousand-that's at least 50 in the
door to pay for the space.
production-plan on spending $4000-that's 200 people right there
security-$500
insurance-depends
PHONE BILL-outrageous
flyers-depending on how fancy you get-let's say $1000 is average-that's 50
people.
that's not counting hotels and flights for your DJs, food and drink for your
workers and the time, effort, and gas it takes to travel to do your
promotions.
Believe me, I've talked with them all and aside from a few big promoters in
this country, no one is making a fortune off of raves.  You can do the math.

Question:  So, is one room, one room...like, is the Irish Center equal to
the Crane because it's one undivided space?  Price has nothing to do with
how many rooms you have.  The main factors are the line-up and the
production.  If you have 20 local DJs spinning in 3 rooms you shouldn't be
charging $20.  If you have Carl Cox, Paul Oakenfold, Josh Wink, Sasha, and
Digweed playing in your living-room, you're going to have to charge a whole
lot if you don't want to loose your shirt.

Also, giving ravers choice on a consistent basis is wonderful. I've
organized after-hours for several events and I've never gone off and changed
the start time by 9 hours without talking to the main event organizer. This
is unheard of.

K-
We're glad you had a good time this weekend.  Rich really hopes you make it
to Intergalactic Circus, if not Remixamatosis.  He's always considered you
such a cool and important part of the Pittsburgh scene.  You were the first
one on his comp list for IGC!  Keep an open mind and make sure you explore
all sides because the info. you're getting right now is definitely tainted.

OK Pat, you can't bull-shit me.  First of all, Rich told you that we were going to
consider bringing Clarkee sometime soon and that you would be perfect to spin when
he came.  NGL has nothing to do with that.  Second of all, don't even talk about
someone not knowing about music.  What the hell?!  Now I'm getting pissed.  Are
you going to tell me that from the day you walked into the scene you knew about
every genre and who the prominent acts/DJs were in each?  That's bull.  I promise
you that I know more about music that you do, any day.  And since I'm working with
Sarah, I take that as an insult. This is all about not letting people into your
little world.  Well, newsflash, it's not yours.  It's OURS.  And neither majority
nor minority rule.  It's who can get shit done and make shit happen.  I am
confident that we can.  Screw your negativity.  I've forwarded some of your trash
talk to a CA act (somewhat comparable to Electric Skychurch) and they think that
you are the devil in disguise.  Quit with all of the "poor us...doing without is
noble and being comfortable means that you're insensitive and selfish"  Get a grip
and quit judging.

I'd like to make sure that the NGL events aren't confused with the
5-Star/Downlow event, Intergalactic Circus.  This party will be a solid,
good sized event.  However, Rabbit in the Moon, Sasha and Digweed are on a
different level.  Downlow is helping NGL and welcoming them into the scene.
We are still our own entity and will be involved as we've been in a capacity
outside of helping NGL.  You'll find that when we rent the Crane for our
event, the space will be recreated to suit our ideas and concerns.
Intergalactic Circus will be the final product of a lot of years of
brain-storming and hard work.  Please make the effort to see that a lot of
different groups are at work here in many different capacities.  Don't lump
us all together.  A lot of the negativity is resulting from that.
Thanks

Sorry K.  That's an old message.  I've since learned a bit about
net-etiquette.  That came from Rich and I on a very bad day. We had been
lied to (as you still are). You can't really say that we know nothing about
the vibe.  Come on...we live for it.

While many are labeling NGL commercial and HOS/John/Pat/renegades not, do
they realize that John was the first person to ever work with Daren of NGL?
Daren was behind one of John's events.  John had no problem with his money
then.  Also, HOS sought out Metropol for an event while we encouraged him not
to.  Let's speak truth here.

This is especially hurtful.  Don't you realize that Rich and I are in this
for the DJs and the ravers?  Anyone who pays any attention knows this.  I'm
very surprised that you're just following along with whatever Pat says.

Maybe you should find out everything that's been said since that particular

Let's create a scenario here:
3 room space=$2000 to rent
18 local DJs at $200 a piece ( although local promoters rarely want to pay them
that)
That's $3600
no travel expenses, no board
-------------------------
One huge room=$2000 to rent
5 out of town DJs @$1000 a piece=$5000
That's $7000 without counting at least $2000 for travel and board
------------------------
Yes, the second party would have to cost more

yeah my friend was telling me how she got a flyer for it and looked at the
person next to her and asked "what day is it?", they said "the 30th" and
she said "boy that's funny because this flyer is for something tonight" and
threw it away . . .
think on it . . .

Okay, the Shine vs. Digital Genesis controversy is pretty much dead...
put a fork in it...

I heard a bunch of rumors and if anyone can shed more light on this,
please do :)

Randy (of Electrolyte FX) who is one cool dude, and seems to put every
penny he makes back into his lights, definatly helping the scene :) is
having his birthday this summer, and in order to celebrate, there's a
party being thrown at the Crane... I'm assuming this is (Remix-a-Matosis
or Intergalactic Circus)? I'm assuming DownLow will do Promotional and
NGL is renting the space to Randy?

Any info would be appreciated :)

Dan K.

i never said this....but what i said was that the underground is in 
danger, and thats not fair to those who like it that way....thats the 
way i like it, and i dont want to see it dissappear....im not telling 
anyone what to do, im ust sticking up for the way i think things should 
be....


>Tom: you want this Utopian "underground" wherein everbody can go to

i hope so, but it might mean that the underground is depleted further to 
get to that point....i mean as it is, theres two free events every 
friday night, and theyre attended by nearly nobody because theyre not 
bigname dj parties.....and thats with a scene that can bring in 1300 
people to see sasha and digweed......


>them.  The only difference is that NGL is starting out with a large sum
>of money from sarah's college fund and whatever other money (I don't 
know
>the specific's of what other money was provided) and John started small
>by saving up money working at the "O".

my problem with this is that john established himself as a promoter and 
worked hard to get to the pint where he could throw a big paty, and 
count on his reputation to support the party.....then out of nowhere 
comes ngl, and they come out firing 3 huge events even before they 
successfully throw the first.....thats a BIG difference....if ngl had 
worked their way up to their status, i would have less of a gripe, but 
they appeatr out of nowhere with these huge raves...its just not he 
same...


>>that is absolutely rude, and intolerable...i cant believe that this 
>>comment would EVER be necessary......i definitely think an apology is 
in
>
>>order here......
>
>I've heard much worse things than this from people i know very well ;)


but not on a mailing list;)

the music may be somewhat (i definitely disagree with the blanket term 
"majority") from big companies, but those companies arent capitalising 
so much on the american scene.....they make money, yes, but most have 
been built up by up-and coming dj's/producers over the years....

understood....its just sad to see everything that i feel to be important 
to ANY scene get packaged in a familiar way and served at a high 
price.....thats why the event that im helping organise will break away 
from thos standards, have a good line-up of talent, and still be only 
$10......im trying to save that aspect of the scene, and big money 
parties can/will prevent that...

Say

In case anyone forgot, there are a few more promoters in Pittsburgh...

Who (besides me) is going to Crush on Saturday? It's only $15... (if yer
low on cash, donate plasma! you get $50 in a week... exchange blood for
a chance to go to a Rave? Hell yes in my opinion :) ) Anyone up for a
netmeat here?

Anyone know if there's an after-hours already set up? or? I'd be in on
helping w/the after-hours if there isn't and someone with more
experience at it wants to point man it :)

Also, any rumors as to the location of Crush? Or if there's gonna be
Rentry? Or any juicy tidbits? :) Email me if you dont wanna broadcast it
:)

I'm looking to pick up a new or used sound system, something about the
size of what was used at Shine... I think it was 2 1200watt amps, a
pre-amp, and 2 speakers capable of doing something like that...

Anyone know of a shop in town that would sell the above equipment?

Also looking to pick up a nice small generator, new or used, about 3k
watts I guess... Any recommendations of where to shop for such a beast?

Also looking for similar recommendations on a good rugged mixer that
would stand up to outdoor use :)

Thanks in advance

Oh yeah, stores in the Pittsburgh area preferably, or even On-line if
not :)

well, im just tired of the same old invalid argument from their 
point.....they should have realised this earlier and just dropped the 
whole thing, and everyone would have been happy...the renegade attendees 
would have had a blast, ngl would be smug knowing that nothing we do can 
stop them, and the d.g. patrons would have had an afterparty to go 
to.....but the main argument came from the downlow/ngl crew......i dont 
think that there should have been n argument in the first place.....if 
they were so confident in their business to invest thousands of dollars, 
they should not have worried about events that draw nearly no one in 
comparison to the number of folks that they expected....


>yet, you don't think pat should apologize to sarah or darren?

he NEVER called anyone a cunt..thats a strong word there

actually kay reposted it earlier in which they said they had been

it....

i think that more people should think about my popint a little 
more....of course youll attract people from the general region, but the 
impact is felt more here where the scene isnt very large as it is...


>also, the point you mentioned that kids would be drawn to the big 
events

king...

but the thing is that the big productions have MUCH better promotion due 
to better funds etc. and the kids that are just getting into the scene 
may never know what it's like to go to a $10 or $15 party....it'll be 
all they know to go to huge events.....it really has to do with the 
flyer/propaganda power of big events......most raves dont have write-ups 
in the city paper or whatever it was that there was an article about 
d.g. in....its not the only one, but for most promoters, there is no 
option for stuff like that...


>and the underground will never die...it will always be there...

i hope so.....

the $3 comment referred to punk shows that i have been to in the 
past....im just saying that there already arent many cheap/free events 
apart from clubs, and with people competing for less money it makes the 
underground that much smaller.....

Umm at that huge event I got a cool ass flyer for a small cheap
underground party next month to be held in the millvale industrial
center by PBS... I'm sure that some broke kid going to this big ass
party as his first rave also got a copy and will show up at this
party... Big parties DO help the little ones... The way I finally hooked
up with the Pittsburgh Rave scene was through a flyer for at the time
pittsburgh's biggest event, Biz... I've gone to ALOT of little parties
since... I'm sure that it happens for alot of people this way...

Herm... lemme shed some light on this... The preview was in "In
Pittsburgh"... One of the DJs who was spinning at Shine, his wife is an
editor there... That DJ was threatened in that really rash post by I
forget who... I'm sure there was no favoritism there that the article
appeared in In Pittsburgh if you get my drift... Also, one of the
NGL/Downlow works for In Pittsburgh's rival, City Paper... Weird turn of
events that an editor knowingly passes an article that was about a party
who's promoters threatened her husband and one of which happen to work
for a rival newspaper.... hehehe... it was just news worthy material...
I also seem to remember a short blurb about Cheer in one or the other
local papers... even a copy of the flyer was printed I believe. I
imagine it's just a matter of writing the papers, sending in your flyer,
explaining why it's important to Pittsburgh, and how their paper will
look more "down" and you should get SOMETHING :)

I agree that there should be a good balance between less expensive parties
with local talent (because there really is a fair deal of TALENT in this
region), but i also think kids should support events with quality out of town
talent.  

Alot of kids here just go to parties with absolutely no idea of who is
spinning and even of what it means to "produce" music, which is okay i guess,
but for some of these kids who devote their lives to "raving", you think it
would make a bit more sense to notice and get excited about someone that isn't
Bad Boy Bill or Dj Funk (I really can't understand how kids can enjoy "let me
see your pussy work" or even bad boy bill scratching his name for 30% of his
set).
  
Promoters who bring certain european acts out here, who anywhere but the
Midwest are hailed as gods, often find that a very small percentage of the
people even know who they are.  This is bad for numerous reasons.  Promoters
who don't "cater" to the average party kids often don't get the number of
attendees that a very lame and NO - talent party will.  This, in my opinion,
makes our "scene" look sorta bad.  There really isn't a solution to this
problem, but i think it would be VERY nice if more promoters would actually
try to "educate" the average raver as to who is worth 20 or 25 bucks and who
is worth 20 or 25 cents.

Sorry if this offends anyone,
Lou

	This has really gotta stop. You're making yourself look foolish.

	Why can't you just let it go? I'm trying not to get involved with

	I know why they booked ES, it had NOTHING to do with

	Drop this crap.

	Enough is enough. No one wants a war.

Good question.  If you need any event info - check out my technology site
http://www.pitt.edu/~gmmst22
I'm going to try to list dj styles on there too if i know.
As for Crush, its not all Drum & Bass - actually its pretty balanced..

As for styles...Joeski I'm not sure - house?, Buster - i don't know, Bob -
used to be from pgh - used to play breaks, acid, Tim - can't remember -
trance maybe?, DJ SQUARED comes with the dark/jazzy drum & bass, and Sine
can do it all from the Drum & Bass to the techhouse....

I guess that wasn't very helpful, but my impression is that its very
rounded, and def not all drum & bass.

l8s,
 cutup

	The only thing i have to say is that i hope i never walk within the circle
of fire that getts people bashing eachother on this list.  whatever the
circle is, it de-plurifies as soon as you get in it. There's no peace, love
is non-existant, unity is definately out the window, and i don't even want
to get into the issue of respect.  Why can't we all just be friends.  When
i left pittsburgh to move to columbus 3 1/2 yrs ago, the kind of behavior
that everybody(except those who have stayed on the sidelines) is exhibiting
on this list is what turned me off to the scene here for almost the entire
time i lived there.  All this allegience bullshit. the cliquey shit must
stop, all the "i'm better that you because i'm more underground or have
better parties or whatever".  without getting off on a rant here, the only
thing i have to say is this:

If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.  There is
room for everybody, but, everybody has to work together.(that's the U part
of plur, incase anybody didn't know).  all this battling will only lead to
a certain and VERY non-eventfull environment for all party kidz in this
town.  I LOVE Pittsburgh, but it's all this bullshit that makes me rather
go to Columbus or cleveland for a party.  Well, i guess i did go off on a
rant, but i will leave you all with this. We should all be working together
for the scene and for pittsburgh, not for DJ Schmoe or john doe promoter.
Keep it together........

The fights getting stale, I think we have all heard all the fight there is 
to hear on this. Can we get over it now? :)

Two things:

Anybody know a good place to mailorder glowsticks from? I really want some 
now, I think I can dance reasonably enough to warrent them. (Call me a 
hypocrit if you like, remember my flameage way back when on dancing :) 
hehe)

Second, someone wanna identify what it was that people were selling out of 
padded cases at DG? They looked like multi collored crack pipes, am I right 
on this? Please tell me im not.  It was mainly at the door by the porta 
johns must have been 20 or so 'pipes' that were swirled in different 
colors. I think I saw atleast two sellers if not more.

There was definitly some bad shit happening at dg but I think the good shit 
out weighed it. Thats the big problem with big parties is that the bigger 
they are the easier it is for the truly bad stuff to be hidden.  I was 
asked a few two many times if I know where I could get some crystal. (I 
presume they meant crystal meth) the irony was that they were polite about 
it when I said no, sorry. My past experiences with harder drug 
users/dealers have always been shitty, but thats from originally being from 
just outside of newark newjersey where gunfire is not unheard of and your 
safety can be determined by skin color.

Me personally, as if anyone cares anymore, I go for the music, the vibe and 
to hang with new people and people on the list.  I couldnt give two shits 
who throws it except that if its a shit party I try to find out so that 
next time I wont go.  But even that doest work, I had a shit time at a HoS 
party a while back and then the next HoS party rocked ass.  Point being, im 
addicted to raving :)

Underground can be fun but big parties can be fun too.  Granted I normally 
do not like big parties but go to them anyway.  This really was the first 
big party that I was satisified with. I think that there is definitly space 
for both big and underground parties, if nothing else the big the parties 
will attract police attention while the small/underground parties will be 
left alone or only lightly monitored.

I also think that atleast in pittsburgh, the police are getting more and 
more used to the idea of raves and what they are about.  They seem to not 
be as 'upset' by them.  And a few seem to enjoy them.  ALLWAYS treat the 
police nice at parties! Show them respect.  I didnt qutie have the gohones 
to do it but I was tempted to go up to the police at DG and thank them for 
being there because they did make me feel safer. I knew that if I had some 
serios problems I could turn to them in a blink of an eye and not have to 
worry so much.

Just think of how hard it is for a cop to be a cop at a rave.  They have to 
have this front of being in power, they cant look like they are 'into it' 
it by definition because police are trained to always have the upperhand, 
if they dont then they can get themselves killed.

Its kinda like babysitting, parties are a place where kids (and adults who 
like to be kids) can go be kids in one environment where the police can 
keep an eye on them instead of having to answer a thousand calls all over 
the city.

No, this isn't an all jungle party.  The line-up is as follows: 

Joeski (NYC): house
Buster (DC): funky breaks 
Bob (Indiana): breaks/hip-hop
Tim Zelch (Pgh): trance/progressive house
DJ Squared (Pgh): drum 'n bass
Sine (Pgh): whatever he's in the mood to spin (if you know Andy I'm
sure you can understand this!)

We hope to see you all there.  Please come early since all the DJ's
are primo and you really don't want to miss anyone. Tickets are on
sale now at Future Sounds and Timebomb.  
We will be selling drinks (very cheap) and you can bring drinks in
(but no glass, please).
If you have any questions feel free to e-mail us or call our info line
at 412-734-8443.
See you all Saturday!
Peace-

um...

        what was the biggest concert in town last year?  I know you had
blur, and I'm guessing a few other huge bands... now... are there still
garage bands in town?  It didn't kill them, right?  And people still go to
their concerts, no?  Geez, the whole meaning of underground is that you
don't have 80 bazillion people at your events

Teehee -- when I first caught a glimpse of these out of the corner of my

little blown glass pipes for pot.

  Why do my words keep getting twisted?  I try to be nice and offer Downlow my
support and they turn around and insult me.  I've always liked and respected
Rich and Kelly.  I've always done my best to keep them as friends.  Now I've
lost alot of respect for them both because I think what they're doing is
wrong.  

Let me state my opinion once again:  I think Rich and Kelly are not doing this
for the good of the scene but more for the attention and respect being a "big
time promoter" brings and maybe even some money and to me that's selling out.
To me it's all about having fun but no matter what I do I can't please people.
I really don't care if I'm blacklisted from NGL or Downlow communications
parties because as of now I won't support either until they get their heads on
straight.  Although I am all for Intergalactic Circus for the fact that it's
also Electrolyte's party.  I probably won't attend it because of some list
Richard might have there but Randy has my full support (=happy b-day=).  I
hope that party fills the space to max capacity and everyone there has a
blast!  As for Remix-a-matosis: there are some very personal reasons why I
will not support that party at all and I hope everyone sees why once House of
Styles responds with a post.  I hope everyone realizes I'm just trying to do
is all for the best.  My intentions are as pure as they get and I'm willing to
fight for what I believe in.   I'm not stupid I'm just deticated.  There have
been threats of breaking legs, blacklists and blackballing DJ's but maybe
that's what I get for trying to make fun for people and not money for myself.
So I'm saying bring it on Darrin, Richard, Kelly and Sarah cause you'll have
to do more than break my legs to make me stop doing something I believe in.  I
really don't care how much money you have, how much power you have or how many
connections you have.  I'll do what I have to to keep it real because I'm NOT
A SELLOUT!!!!!!  This is all coming from me and not John from House of Styles
(he can post his own message).

I think I'm being more than fair.
peace,
Pat Friend

P.S.  Oh yeah Darrin:  you're just silly

if that's all you are worried about, you can chill, cause the
underground will ALWAYS exist, and as you keep saying over and over,
for the most part it has little to do with/isn't fueled by money.

if that's all you are worried about, you can chill, cause the
underground will ALWAYS exist, and as you keep saying over and over,
for the most part it has little to do with/isn't fueled by money.

[David Schwanke]  I was thinking about this. Ya know, I like the idea of 
techno/raves going mainstream.  And the reasoning is this:  We'll have more 
to choose from music wise. We wont have to go digging through bins at hard 
to get to music stores to find what we want.  There may actually be shit 
worth watching on television (lets hear it for AMP!) And above all else 
(and this is just me and the way I am) I like the idea of being able to say 
"Ive been in this before mtv knew what the fuck was going on" But then 
again, im the kinda guy that thinks "Back in my day..." phrases are cool.

i came back from toronto anticipating the reviews of digital genesis..

ok get ready...i know this is late but i want to say it.

you ppl need to shut the fuck up.

tom what u are saying makes so little sense its ridiculous, you want to
preserve the underground and make sure the pgh scene still runs the way
youd like it to (to paraphrase your own words)? cmon man, we've already
been over and around and back again on the whole 'who should run the scene'
bullshit.  your comment about big parties sucking the money out of the
underground is ludicrous....dan kelly had a good point (hi dan:) about
seeing flyers for little underground events at big parties.

i went to bars, then clubs, then mega raves, then underground events, in
that order, i think most ppl did too. and please...the money thing...half
these kids get paid by their parents, i've seen it, so whatever, you dont
have to take on the fiscal responsibility for the poor, huddled, shivering
crusty ravers living under a bridge trying to get into the party. they
should fucking get a job anyway.

look. pgh has sucked ass for longer than you know. im not pulling senority
on you, but i am very glad to see name brand recognizable talent in this
town for a change. 

i have no first hand association with any of the parties involved (which is
kinda weird personally, but its ok)...i mean i've seen rich talked to him,
etc...kelly i bet i would recognize on sight...those two are downlow
communications...ok, im just getting that clear for my own sake too...i
think they can be given the benefit of the doubt with no reservations...

sarah and daren and the third partner in NGL i have never met. but what the
hell, they are bringing in world class talent to this godforsaken city.
this city that so often lacks excitement, energy, and enthusiam...holy
shit? they want to bring in name talent and present them professioanlly an
they actually hav the *money* to do it? someone fetch my shotgun,
y'all...they're the "devil"

tom, this isnt directed towards you...dont feel singled out.

from what i can gather, (again, not knowing all the parties involved 
doesnt give me much of a leg to stand on) there's bad blood on a personal
level beteen pat friend and maybe john brommage and NGL...whatever...if
these kids give a fuck about the scene their personal beef needs to be
squashed immediately and ppl need to move on.


look, everyone should do whatever the fuck they want to do and not be so
ill towards one another, the first good glimmer of us getting consistent
quality is not something to shun...and the bitches who try and keep that
from happening dont need to be around.

christ, ppl need to grow the fuck up and put aside their petty personal and
philosophical differences and realise theres room enuff (i grow oh so tired
of repeating these words) for everyone to do everything in this city. all
you stupid fucks need to do is look at the competitive scenes in other
cities and think 'is that the way i really want pittsburgh to be?'


there's room for free renegades

there's room for smaller events like the pbs one on july 24 and crush this
weekend...(big up the sessions cru to the max, seen)

there's room for medium sized HoS parties like biz and cheer, etc...

there's room for massives like all this cool shit going down at the crane,
regardless of who's throwing it...


you assholes should be THANKFUL (yeah, i know..caps) that there arent any
crews in this town like local 13, or like spawntaneous (rip cleveland,
hopefully shortarm and other good crews can bring that city back from the
$25 shit ass cookie cutter party quagmire its in)...every crew in this town
is talking positivity and thats a great start. 

so (to everyone) stop your petty quibbling and get on track. this summer
will rock, with or without you..wouldnt you much rather be part of the
scene that actually contributes rather than the minority that does nothing
but bitch? let's leave them behind.


peace,
hossam

I'm really looking forward to Crush this weekend for the simple fact that
it'll be a comfortable, no-conflict party.  I'm also thinking of
introducing my sister to raving.  There could be one slight snag.  She'll
be 13 in the end of June.  She's awful young and most people may have
perceived me as down on really young ravers.  She LOVES to dance, though.
I also think she's smart enough to stay away from shade and illegal
substances.  She's also starting to be really closed-minded and I'm
fretfully searching for something to open her eyes to the world.  I almost
want her to see the tail-end of raving before it does emerge into the
bright light of the mainstream.  (I think that it's all still pretty much
underground)  Any thoughts?  Is this bad?  Is this good?  Faux pas (or as
my sister would say: fox pass)?

well...are you really prepared to expose your sister to some of the shit
that goes on? for the potential for people to go up to her and offer her
k, crystal, E, weed, acid, etc? it's hard to keep away from that stuff
100% since dealers don't wait for people to go to them, they approach
people...if she's mature enough, that's great...you know her best...

something that disturbed me was when i was at terminal velocity earlier
this year...and this kid who looked like he was at most 12 offered me
every drug under the sun...apparently, some dealer was using him to run
in exchange for freebies...

Rich and I thought it important to include everyone who has done something
significant in the scene on the comp list.  Sarah agreed.   Remember, the
old and the new coming together?  Pat was organizing the after hours for
Digital Genesis, so of course he'd get a pass.  Sarah didn't specifically
give him one.  She trusted our judgement.

NGL only has 2 events to speak of:  Digital Genesis and Remixamatosis.
Intergalactic Circus is a collaborative effort from those who have been in
the scene much longer than John.  That event has nothing to do with NGL.

Would you consider the Underground a BIG TIME promotion company (Tunnel
Vision, etc.)?  I remember watching those guys scrape and save to throw
their parties and they weren't exactly what you would call small.  They were
also the first to be written up in a local paper.  John Dwight had his
picture in local publications years ago.  If you weren't around at least ask
around.

So am I!!!  Randy and I aren't exactly millionaires and we're very proud of
the job we've done with Intergalactic Circus.  My money comes from selling
long-distance and raising other people's children.  Randy works his ass off
doing lights.  You can make it happen no matter what financial position
you're in.
Let's stop exaggerating about the underground in this city.  You're talking
about one night out of each month.  What's the underground doing the other
30 nights?

anybody seen this numark 'dj in a box' thing? it's in the latest geetar
center catalog. $399 for two turntables and a microphone. er, i mean a
mixer w/x-fade and headphones. ;)  there's also a gemini 'dj kit one' with
2 tables, mixer, hat, slipmats, cabling, and some stupid video i'm never
gonna use. think it's worth getting one of these for some 'beater' tables?
(fyi; i torture tables like you wouldn't believe. i've screwed up the arms
on my 1200SL's quite a few times cuz i'm so abusive:)  

also, fyi, slip mats for $2, stanton 500AL bc discos for $30, Lytequest
PAR56L for $55, PAR64L for $60.  ortofon ccproskit with a pair of extra

                     OK guys for those of you who couldn't download my paper
from ATTACH file here it is in print - sorry to take up so much space for
those of you that aren't interested in learning about MDMA damage but I
thought I might help someone - peace -N-


MDMA Related Compounds and Neurotoxicity

Introduction:
 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine and 3,4-
Methylene-dioxymethaphetamine are amphetamine analogs.  These drugs have great
potential as diet drugs, treatment for terminally ill cancer patients and
possibly psychotherapy.  Fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are widely used as
diet drugs while MDA and MDMA have often been used for treatment in cancer
patients and have similarities to amphetamine and mescaline, a well-known
hallucinogen.  MDA and MDMA therefore have great abuse potential and are yet
to be accepted in the medical field despite anti-depressant qualities.  These
drugs are FDA restricted (Ricarte 1985).
 The studies I have selected point to, and assess the risks involved with
these drugs, namely neurotoxicity to serotonin nerve receptors and Primary
Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) sometime seen in conjunction with fenfluramine
use.  In addition, MDA and MDMA can produce mydroasis, salvation tachycardia,
hypertension, hypothermia and sometimes death.  Serotonin neurotoxicity is
when serotonin axons are lost and PPH is a disease where pulmonary arterial is
greater than twenty-five mm Hg at rest or thirty mm Hg with exercise.  PPH can
lead to death and the affects of serotonin toxicity are not yet known.  The
first paper I have chosen, is a review of evidence linking these drugs to
toxicity and PPH (McCann 1997).  While the other article I have selected is a
study showing norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin responses to varying
doses of MDA in different parts of the brain.  I have also cited an interview
with one of the primary researchers in serotonin neurotoxicity related to MDMA
use, and a paper discussing effects on cognition in humans.
Methods-
In order to perform tests on serotonin toxicity, rats were given successive
doses of MDA at twelve  hour intervals for 4 days.  Some were used as controls
and other doses ranged from 1.25  40 ml/kg.  Neurotransmitters were then
measured two weeks after drug treatment (Table 1).  Another experiment gave
rats 10 mg MDA for 4 days and brain slices were analyzed after 2 weeks for
damage using the Fink-Heimer method which impregnates degenerated axons and
nerve terminals.  The last group of rats were given 10 mg MDA every twelve
hours for 4, 2, 1 and .5 days and analyzed 2 weeks after the experiment was
conducted (Ricarte 1985).
 Other methods were used in the reviewed studies, but were all performed by
experts in serotonin neurobiology, neuropsychiatry, neurotoxicity and
pulmonary medicine discovered through MEDLINE and the National Institutes of
Health registry on PPH.  Some of the tests reviewed used single doses of
drugs, or large and small repeated doses.  The studies evaluated short term as
well as long term effects and there were some contradictory results.  Rats,
mice, guinea pigs, squirrel monkeys, rhesus monkeys and baboons have all been
tested and functional consequences of drugs reviewed.  There is little human
testing.  Drugs have been administered orally, interperitoneally, and
subcutaneously and clinical experience included.  One important method used is
evaluating plasma level of drug concentration for interspecies comparison
(McCann 1997).
Results:  Table One






 The first table is a demonstration of how MDA affects neurotransmitters in
increasing doses.  This experiment demonstrates significant serotonin
neurotoxicity in doses as low as 5 mg/kg affecting parts of the brain such as
the striatum and hippocampus with increasing damage with higher doses, but no
functional defects were observed in rats.  When rats were given medium doses
for successive days, brain slices as well kinetic analysis of H-labeled
serotonin uptake showed reduction in the number, but not the affinity, of
synaptosomal serotonin uptake sites.  Long lasting effects were observed in
the hippocampus.  This leads to the conclusion of serotonin neurotoxicity.
Results:  Table Two






Another experiment demonstrated that a single injection led to a thirty-two
percent reduction of hippocampus serotonin (Ricarte 1985).
 When experiments utilizing fenfluramine, MDMA and dexfenfluramine were
reviewed, similar results were found.  Since the 1970s, many scientists have
found single doses of fifteen to twenty-seven mg/kg of fenfluramine in rats
produced seventy percent reductions of serotonin lasting over 2 weeks.  This
was often seen with a decrease in serotonin uptake sites and are dose related
results.  The neocortex, striatum, hippocampus and medial hypothalamus are
most effected.
 However there are problems with sensitivity and specificity for detecting
degeneration of serotonin axons in morphological methods, and some anatomical
studies have not found Neurotoxicity.  Younger rats were also shown to be less
susceptible to damage and studies may be species specific.  However as stated
in the methods section, a wide variety of animals have been tested with
primates showing more sensitivity to toxicity than rodents, and comparing
doses between species has caused some difficulty possibly solved by measuring
plasma concentration and controlling administrating methods.  It is also
important to know that serotonin toxicity is seen in doses roughly equivalent
to that needed to produce weight loss and hallucinogenic amphetamine-like
affects seen in recreational users.
 Some axon regeneration has been seen however, but studies say that is may be
incomplete with damage remaining more than a year after administering the
drug.  Severity (size and time span) of drug administration may affect ability
to regenerate axons.  Tolerance to anorectic action of dexfenfluramine has
been evident and may be related to loss of serotonin axons or denervation
super sensitivity of postsynaptic serotonin receptors (McCann 1997).
 Few functional consequences have been determined, but methods of testing may
not be subtle enough to detect small behavior changes in animals.  One paper
on human psychological study shows negative changes in mood and cognitive
behaviors of human MDMA uses.  (Curran 1997) Clinical experience has also
linked serotonin to congnition, memory, mood, anxiety, impulsivity,
aggression, sleep, pain and neuroendocrine function.  These drugs may also
affect depression, psychosis, sleep disturbance and worsening of pre-existing
conditions.  PPH may also be related to fenfluramine use because users are ten
times more likely to develop PPH with risk increasing with duration of use
(McCann 1997).

Discussion:
 In this paper I have discussed the risks involved with MDMA related compounds
including the possibility of Neurotoxicity and PPH.  The first study I
reviewed showed conclusive evidence of serotonin Neurotoxicity at doses of 5
mg/kg with long lasting selective axon degeneration.  However this study did
not demonstrate functional consequences or determine correlation of this rat
study with human Neurotoxicity or amount correlation with average human use.
This evidence is just one study, but most others that were reviewed came to
the same conclusion of Neurotoxicity as well as some showing correlation of
PPH with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine use.  A few studies however,
directly contradicted findings of Neurotoxicity or said it could be reversed
leading one to believe more testing is still necessary.  Further testing is
also necessary to determine if all these ring-substituted amphetamines
structurally related to MDMA are modified into neurotoxic compounds in vivo.
In addition more controlled studies should be conducted to determine how MDMA
related compounds effect humans physiologically, psychologically and
disfunctions arising from use.

To whom it may concern-
  Earlier this year, we (Rabbit In The Moon) were confronted by two 
promoters simultaneously, requesting us to play Pittsburgh on June 19th. 
These promoters (John w/Hose of Style, and Darren w/NGL), were both very 
professional, but we had to make a decision to work with one or the 
other.We chose to work with Darren/NGL. Our decision was based on the 
fact that Darren already had possession of a legal venue to hold the 
show. We would still consider working with both promoters in the future, 
and our decision does not reflect the quality of the promoter whatsoever. 
They are both very good people. We just wanted to post this before any 
misconceptions are derived from our decision, or rumors are spread.
See you at the show,
Rabbit in the Moon

Thanx Lou,

your point is well taken, by someone who knows what talent is.  
Education is the key.  There are many wys to educate yourself.  Without 
excluding other possibilities, might I suggest reading downlow's posts, 
shopping at hypervinyl, reading dr. cutup's website, and attending 
platform soul, NATO, and Steel City Jngle on a regular basis!

"see you at the show"?

someone thinks they are cool don't they?

maybe rabbit in the moon will be cool and give me an autographed cd and a
smile, only for 10 bucks eh?  (sarcasm intended, please understand).

i guess rabbit in the moon is okay, but why does everyone treat them like
gods?  there are SO many better live acts than them, and they definitely have
no musical reputation to back their "extravagent live show".

i'm not trying to cut on ritm for their choice of who to play for (although
BOTH promoters have their shit together), just for their choice to think that
they are "the shit".  

sorry once again if this offends anyone,
lou

Is it no longer possible for someone to make an innoculous comment on this 
list without being torn to shreds by somebody else? Im fairly confident 
that "see you at the show" is quite a common phrase from most dj's that are 
going to be spinning or playing or performing or whatever at a future show. 
I think i may have even used it once or twice and I dont even perform 
anything!


EVERBODY (and not just you CircutryX) GET OFF YOUR FUCKING HIGH HORSES 
ALREADY! Sometimes I start to doubt my beliefe in freedom of speech.

SMILE DAMMIT! HAVE FUN DAMMIT!

I just woke up. :)

_Hey Guys here is an ongoing MDMA debate feel free to add to it if you
want!
<BLOCKQUOTE TYPE=CITE>>

<P>I read this paper the first time you sent it, and in a self-imposed
<BR>exercise in self-control I decided to not post a reply to it.&nbsp;
However,
<BR>its second posting has led me to re-read it, and now I am posting.

<P>Although you do mention that several studies are conflicting and/or
<BR>totally contradictory to other studies, the one major flaw I saw
<BR>immediately is your example, "This experiment demonstrates significant
<BR>serotonin neurotoxicity in doses as low as 5 mg/kg affecting parts
of
<BR>the brain such as the striatum and hippocampus with increasing damage
<BR>with higher doses ..."&nbsp; In order to achieve this HIGH a level
of MDA in
<BR>one's body, one would need to ingest about 4 pills at the same time,
<BR>which is above the _optimum_ dose.&nbsp; One would have no reason to
over-do
<BR>their dosage all at once, as the effects would not become better after
a
<BR>certain point (about 130mg for MDA, slightly lower for MDMA).&nbsp;
It also
<BR>must be noted that while such high doses of MDA over a period of time
do
<BR>cause some nerve axon damage, it is not conclusive that MDMA causes
the
<BR>same damage, or that serotonin does not slowly climb back up to original
<BR>levels over time.&nbsp; Think about it -- rats are given much higher
than
<BR>normal doses over a period of days, then killed shortly afterwards
to
<BR>have their brains analyzed.&nbsp; Also note -- mice were not used very
often
<BR>in these studies, since neither MDA nor MDMA are neurotoxic to them
at
<BR>all.
<BR>(I also want to add that comparing MDA to MDMA is a much less accurate
<BR>comparison than MDMA to fenfluramine, as MDA and MDMA are mediated
by
<BR>*different* neurotransmitter systems. There's not even cross-tolerance
<BR>between them).

<P>By the way, anyone who reads enough about this stuff can see that George
<BR>Ricaurte (your main reference) is the _foremost_ anti-MDMA researcher
<BR>out there.&nbsp; He *hates* the stuff, and he is frequently challeneged
by
<BR>other scientists who report very conflicting findings.

<P>Now a question that I will throw out to everybody who has read this
far:
<BR>Why is it that fenfluramine, which is known to cause major heart
<BR>problems, aside from being very similar to MDMA in neurotoxicity is
<BR>legal and FDA approved ... BUT, MDMA, which is not reported to cause
<BR>heart problems, is illegal?!!!&nbsp; Is this simply because MDMA is
fun, and
<BR>fenfluramine simply makes you lose weight?&nbsp; MDMA is great as a
diet pill
<BR>-- this stuff really works.&nbsp; Just another example of the government
<BR>deciding what is safe for our consumption (apparently alcohol and
<BR>cigarettes are; they're legal).

<P>--Amanda

<P>_____________

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK&nbsp; So my turn to reply
- Please be carefull what you say I don't want a war I want to help educate
people.&nbsp; I am
<BR>for xtc legalization and agree with your veiw on the federal gov. (i.e.
they are fucked up) I am also aware that Ricaurtewho&nbsp; is not my MAIN
referance is anti-xtc.&nbsp; However, if you read the interview included
his opposition is using unproven techniques to determine if damage is caused
my MDMA.&nbsp; ALSO Ricaurte is ONLY one of several scientists that I used
in several papers and I focused on his study becuse it was one example
of pretty conclusive evidence showing damage.&nbsp; There are lots of studies
in this area and one of the other main papers I used was just a review
of the important studies done in the last 20yrs.&nbsp; There were contradictory
results as I stated but the overwhelming majority found at least some evidence
of damage.&nbsp; Of those that did ffind damage many found it to last over
two weeks and sometimes over a year at which point the studies were discontinued.&nbsp;
Also it is important to note that although one of the studies I showed
(the Ricaurte one) utilized rats PRIMATES HAVE SHOWN MORE SENSITIVITY to
damage.&nbsp; Also you are wrong about the mice at least in fenfluramine
related drugs as they "have been associated with long-lasting decrements
in serotonin axonal markers in rats, mice, guinea pigs, squirrel monkeys(Figure),
rhesus monkeys, and baboons."(McCann et al - see previous referance list).&nbsp;
Not everything that you find off the internet is correct - please referance
it and find out about the authors background. Also, I am also aware that
MDMA is more closely related to fenfluramine and it's derivatives than
to MDA but included the MDA study because in xtc pills (at least for those
of us who don't do it too frequently) are hard to distinguish from MDA,
MDAE, or for that matter a number of other drugs and they are structurally
related

<P>Please note that there are a variety of studies out there assesing different
doses, durations, species, administration and testing methods -Many of
which were reviewed in my paper.&nbsp; The animals may be kept alive of
a year and the doses are not always extremely large when you take into
account absorption rates and blood plasma level along with species variability.

<P>YES, WE NEED MORE STUDIES BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE REALISTIC -Learn about
and accept the risks - there is no such thing as the perfect drug.

My suggestion is in the bar upstairs (the one all the way at the back up
and up the stairs -- it's a separate room with its own door).  It seems
like a natural place for a net meet.  Plus, it has couches!

You have no right placing this on the list.  You are deliberately making fun
of post-nineteen-eighty people. This is unacceptable.  Haven't you ever
heard of respect; you know, it's the R in PLUR.

|>>>>> The name Jeff Spicoli rings a bell.


Hey.  I was born in 1980 (and we aren't that naive).  This may be a special
case, but I know exactly who Jeff Spicoli is.  It's the guy from Fast Times
at Ridgemont High!!  Yeaaaaahhhh  Boyeeeeeee (public enemy) !! I was so up
on everything when I was two.

Damn that was the bomb... had that on 8-track... it was still a little
too-close-to-disco to play in public tho :) I'd think that song came out
right about the time I bought my first Kraftwerk Cassette... damn...
speaking of kraftwerk, anyone going to see them in DC?

Hey is there anyone from Columbus on this list going to Cleveland on Friday
that might be able to hook a girl up w/ a ride. I have money, all that jazz.
Please just e-mail me privately. By the way, has anyone heard about Keoki ( in
June ) and Josh Wink (end of July sometime) coming to Red Zone? I just heard
this about 10 minutes ago, I was wondering if anyone could confirm it.

this e-mail flyer from the Breaks list (a jungle list):

CORRECTION:

DARA will be at SUMMER BREAKS this SUNDAY, JUNE 7th, and not on the 14th.

(On the 14th we will have:
	JOESKI
	FRANK RYDE
	DEISELBOY
	JOHN TAB
	ROB-ONE
	K-SET
	BOBBY LILES)

We apologize for any confusion.  

Peace,

DIGITAL BASS'D

Tim Zelch plays "melodic trance" . . . pretty good stuff if you are in
the mood.

Buster is from the snowball collective, so I'm pretty sure he plays
jungle . . . all the rest of them do :)

I wasn't there, but I'm pretty sure those are glass bowls.  They are not
for smoking anything other than a nice pipefull of tobacco in ;) 
Seriously though, I think they are mainly for smoking bud in . . . the
only thing is because of the strange shape of the bowl piece, most people
for soem reason don't put a screen in them which causes you to get
mouthfuls of ash if you take a hit a little too big, or there's a whole
bunch of ash.  A lot of the times you can see the flaming nugs flying
into the persons mouth through the transparent tube :)

Is this an all ages event?  Can i get some more info about this?  By the
way, (no offense to anyone) i'm not sure I want to meet anyone from the
list, the way you guys have been bitching at each other, which happens quite
often.  You have a right to vent, but please, we need a chat room for this
or something.

	What the hell are you talking about? "no musical reputation?"

	What the fuck ever. RITM have a stellar musical reputation,

ok, the ones i wear are not wax...those suck. 

the ones i wear are called "mack's" ;)

'pillow soft earplugs' they have a noise reduction rating of 22db..

you can buy them at revco/cvs, rite aid, etc...

these are silicone and they are clearish very soft very comfortable...foam
ones tend to not fit well and HURT...

these mold perfectly to your ear and come out in one piece they arent
stringy or gummy or anything. i love them

they even come in convenient little plastic carrying cases (4 to a case)
each one can be split in half and even that is kind of alot, (like if u
have small ears you may be able to get away with 1/4 a piece per ear...
they are like $3 for a 4 pack and are reusable (one peice can be used like
2-3 times before they get too nasty depending on your personal hygiene)



try em.

peace,
hossam

thursday, new york undercover, 8PM

i'm just sitting here.  a promo for new york undercover comes on.  this one
is about a drug dealer that frequents "raves".  he sells e laced with [STRIK
NYNE] (i cant spell that).  an excerpt had some guy [raver] talking to
someone else, "i don't want that here" [drugs].  so, it seems that the rave
scene will have some mass representation tomorrow.  it actually looks
interesting.  the prime-time-drama-archetype for the raver will be
displayed.  however, these are NYC ravers..they will vary from pgh ravers i
presume...but still, totally rad.

warm air mass meet cool air mass,

Andy

Becca:

Something comfortable.  Test it out in your room first.  There is no dress
code although some like to adhere to one.  I suggest: cotton, if you live on
the edge (dacron, or other polyester).  People won't look at you funny if
you aren't the most outrageously dressed...just relax =]

We do have a listing for a party in Cleveland called Continuim, although no one
has entered a line-up.  Tell pbs to give us their date and line-up to add to
the list..  Promoters are finding this list very helpful. It goes out to over
60 promoters each weekend.  It's intent is to keep from what happened on the
30th (party in Pitt & party in Cleve.) from happening.
Peace
Kelly

yeah i took my friends to their first rave and my first one in about a year
and i was not prepared
baggy pants age VERY GOOD!
fuck a fashion statement, they're built in AC!
you get hot? just sit down and roll 'em up and chill
my friend was so worried "oh i won't fit in, everyone will look at me
funny" and then we got there and she was like "oh i fit in just fine"
anything goes really, just be comfy
i was wearing a shiny silver shirt last time but lost that very quickly and
my undershirt too because i was sooo damn hot
but i danced from the 10pm-5am just about non stop (well water breaks and
such of course) so whatever works
just remember, at 6 in the morning you aren't gonna give a shit what you
look like if you are uncomfortable AND tired
cheers,

Well, I'm not sure at this point if I'm included in the list of "not wanting to
meet", but...I'll be there, working as usual.  Look for the tall gal with lots

if you are going to crush this weekend, dress to sweat.

cotton is good, but sweat doesnt evaporate off it.

i prefer soccer jersey material (lycra, polyester, whatever that stuff it) 

i mean the newer stuff wicks moisture off your skin so u stay cool+dry and
it evaporates quickly so your clothes dont get soaked.

and going out in the morning with sweat soaked clothes sucks and you can
get sick that way.

also, you probably dont want to wear super expensive clothes (its up to
you) but whatever you take to a party you better be prepared to get dirty
(unless of course you plan on standing around looking cool all nite ;)

dress, in loose, comfortable clothes, no one gives a fuck anyway.

peace,
hossam

Actually, if you smoke bud often enough, you can very definatly tell 
if your smoking through glass or metal..therefore, if your smoking 
through a nice glass bowl, it completely ruins it to put a metal 
screen in it...I can deal with sucking ash to not smoke through 
metal... :)

Speaking of sports jersey material, I got this Converse shirt made out of
two layers of basketball jersey stuff (with the tiny little holes) and
thicker stuff around the shoulders and neck.  I hadn't been that comfortable
dancing since my "naked raver" days.
                                                        just kidding,

	First off, I'd like to say I have nothing against you... hell I don't
even
know you other then reading your posts from the mailing list. But I
cannot express
how *wrong* this idea is.

	Your sister is 12 years old. She is not even a teenager yet. 12 years
old.
As her sister you have a very important part in her development. She is
at a very 
impressionable age, and I would assume she looks up to her sister very
much. 
Now you are telling me that you would like to bring her to a place where
most of 
the people are on drugs? Where people are SHOOTING UP in plain view of
everyone? How 
could you even think of such a thing? What were you planning on saying
when confronted
with the issue of the substances used? 

	I know there are many young people at parties. At some point someone
must have 
introduced them to the scene. This doesn't mean that its all right
though. I would
imagine a kid would have a good time at a rave. Hell, I would have loved
to go to
parties when I was 12. But it is just not the environment for kids to be
brought up in.
You cannot shield them from all the negative elements that are present
at these
events.

	I'm not saying that parties are horrible places, full of sin and vice,
but 
one cannot escape these things. You cannot say that a 12 year old would
be able to think 
entirely for herself in this sort of situation, especially when someone
she loves
and reveres is guiding her into it. One cannot help but think that, in
the light of
goes on at a party someone so young and impressionable could not
manifest a positive
viewpoint on these aspects...

Don't do it	

> Jenifer Foulmood

leif (also in a foul mood)

ps: Why is everyone so scared about raving becoming "mainstream"? Isn't
a party that 
costs $25 or brings in 9,000 people mainstream? That's been happening
for years...
The worst thing that can happen to parties is we'll get some dj's that
actually
know how to spin....

leif...

while i agree with many of the fine points you made, i must comment on
something you said (it is relatively minor considering everything else)...

the sessions crew has worked very hard to make it clear that ignorance and
disrespect of the sort you mentioned above (shooting up, smoking crack)
WILL NOT IN ANY WAY BE TOLERATED.

there is one reason sessions throws parties. to present quality music in an
intimate space and build a tight vibe.  anyone who does anything in
contradiction to this goal is dealt with harshly (those of you who went to
their last party in december know what i am talking about).

again, i applaud you for being considerate enough to bring these points up
to jennifer, i wanted to make absolutely clear that kind of behavior is
absolutely not tolerated at this particular party. thank you very much.

peace,
hossam

Functionally? Something rugged, your clothes will get abused bad...
something that wont look dirty when it's dirty... Something that's
really cool (as in not hot) if you're going to dance alot... Don't bring
anything extra that you cant fit into your pockets... that may prompt
you to wear pants with big pockets :) herm... would be nice to fit a
waterbottle into those pockets too... yes... mebby JNCOs? I'm not a
style expert but those are the functionality issues I'm aware of from a
Man's perspective:)

Dude, first of all, fix your word wrapping or something :)

I dunno, I can kind of see your point... but on the other hand I also
see it in a different light... I mean I would be like "See those
scumbags over there shooting up? that's definatly NOT cool"... And if
she really looked up to me she'd say "Yep that's disgusting"... if she
didn't look up to me... herm... I prolly wouldn't bring her. On the
other hand... if the first time she experiences it is when she's at a
friend's house and the friend breaks out a needle... she might not have
anyone around to tell her that it's evil... I dunno... hard call
though... I think I'd wait a few years myself?

Someone was asking about Radio Carson... I think it's down cause the
power's out in that part of the woods STILL... heh they got temporary
stop-signs on the slope in place of the stoplights... I was driving my
car and saw this big ass flash and boom, radio-carson went dead... I'm
assuming that strike took out the power line though and wasn't a direct
hit on Radio Carson :)It'd be a good assumption I think cause half the
slopes ARE out of power... dunno if that would surge the Carson tho...

*crossing fingers*

Dan K

btw, I just noticed the other day that Radio Carson is Mono!... Ugh...
hehehe now it's bothering the piss out of me :( I guess Mono Techno is
better than Stereo Country and Western any day tho :)

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, i'd like some feedback on this?

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   [1]trout@hyperreal.org


please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

   Jul 10-12 TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL Texas [major far away, but really
   looks fun!!!! WOo-HA! lots of camping for me this summer!!!] As you
   may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
   Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
   Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this
   great cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00
   camping/maintenance fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On
   average the talent we are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of
   them are unsigned and some of them are simply putting out their own
   records. It is truly a special treat to see them all in one location.
   This is a great "convention" if you will; of the best Texas has to
   offer. This year all talent and volunteers will pay nothing and be
   provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and drinks. This year we
   are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a nominal $15.00 for
   the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any profit made on
   this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us in the
   morning! Bring a can good if you can. Anyway,...back to the
   convention. The convention of sorts is called the "Texas Electronica
   Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas Electronica
   Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
   Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
   ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
   porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
   showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and
   lots of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July
   10th. Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required
   to cover maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates
   will close at Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates
   will be locked for your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will
   re-open at 9 am Sun July 12th. We will have everything you need during
   this timeframe, EMS as well. Only under extreme circumstances would
   you be allowed to pass through our 2 gates to the outside world
   between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This is a campout, please
   come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks, tents, beach balls,
   kites...whatever. QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said
   "So if you want a touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a
   huge dollop of raveyness, then this is the place to be. Just don't
   forget to pack the toilet paper along with the tent. After all this is
   the great outdoors!" The listings!!! These are in no order! send mail

what is vigra?  Sorry just dumb I guess!

Uh about the clothes thing - If u r a girl I definately suggest a tank
top of cotton or something to keep cool.  Fat pants are good and wear
tennis shoes, bring water, and posssibly a hat or hair twitstie to keep
sweaty hair out of your face also wear clothes that can get dirty! Have
fun! -N-

Wow, you guys are amazing.  80% of the people on this list have been
talking shit on Daren and Sarah for weeks and now you want to use his
space for a benefit?  For free, at that?  Do you really think they're
going to go for that?

Basically we don't believe it is a good idea for very young people to
attend parties (at least not as young as your sister).
I understand that she may come for a good reason, to dance, but we
can't condone this behavior of a 12 year old for these reasons:
1. Should something happen to her we are held responsible.  Though we
have insurance for such things, insurance companies don't look
favorably on clients who have 12 year old girls up all night in
warehouses.  
2.  Hou would your parents feel?  Would they even know about it?  I
know that mine would have freaked
out if I did this shit when I was 12.  Again, if something happened to
her we would be responsible.  This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.
3.  The parties we do are for more mature audiences (i.e. no drug
bullshit, posturing, fashion show bullshit, etc.).  I don't believe a
12 year old can make these descisions for herself.
Please don't think we are engaging in ageism.  It would be one thing
to expose her to the scene in a club, where it's a very controlled
environment.  But we all know that sometimes crazy shit can happen at
a rave, no matter how hard you try to keep it low-key, and this is no
place for a child.
If you want to get her into the music, we can send her some tapes. 
Leave your address on our info line and Dustin and I will send her our
new mix tapes and tapes from the party.
See ya Saturday.
Peace-
Andy....Sine.....Sessions 1998

Definitely....but don't not come because you think it's going to be
sweltering in there.  We're getting those big industrial size
airconditioners, so it shouldn't be too bad.

From: Matt Massive <massive@mixcom.com>
To: mw-raves@hyperreal.org
Subject: DOORMOUSE AFTERMATH

I've decided to lay low and see what people have had to say about the
actions of Dan Doormouse at Even Furthur.  The response has been varied,
but it seems there is an overall support for what he did this past
weekend.  I will stand to agree that the scene will always need someone
who pushes the limits of what is acceptable at these parties.  The
moment we decide that only certain actions, ways of dress, and
boundaries of taste are what are acceptable is when a scene has
officially homogenized and killed itself.  On most levels, this has been
true of the rave scene for a number of years.  This is why what Dan did
this past weekend was so shocking to so many.  I, for one, have felt
that the scene has needed a good kick in the ass, and anyone who reads
Massive should get that impression.  Regardless of the delivery, I have
always stood behind the writers of Massive to say what they felt had to
be said, and do what they had to do.  Dan has opted for the extremes in
the past, and has taken this to new levels.

On a different level though, I would hope that the expected response to
what he does is repulsion.  Normal people don't shove fingers in their
ass in public and wipe raw meat all over themselves.  Nor would i want
this to be a commonplace thing at every party i attend.  This is what
makes Dan's actions an anomaly, and this is what many of us looking for
something vastly different in our scene have come to encourage.  Dan
would not have done any of this without encouragement, and for that, i
am quite guilty... as are many others who know him or came into contact
with him this weekend.  Many of us have opinions of what we'd like to
see happen or see someone do, but most of us are very unwilling to do it
ourselves.  The moment someone comes along with the lack of inhibition
or willingness to make an idiot out of themselves, we flock around that
person to see what they'll do next.  Dan was our idiot.

This isn't to say that Dan isn't an intelligent person.  He knew what he
was doing the whole time- regardless of the alcohol he drank in bulk
this weekend.  This, more than anything, made what he did all the more
disgusting... and sad.  Because, at a certain point, the fun and
silliness stopped and Dan crossed the line of respect.  At a certain
point, not too long after throwing motor oil at people he didn't know
(they walked away seriously pissed wanting to kick his ass and did
nothing about it), he destroyed a tent he had nothing to do with
building, and threw a grill that wasn't his property.  He threw poles at
people and chased them with lit torches.  He stepped outside of the
boundaries of what is acceptable by damaging other people's stuff and
work, and endangered those around him.  He went from everyone's silly
retard boy who shoved meat in his ass to a straight-up disrespectful,
destructive moron.

After having the generator turned off on him, he yelled that Brenda and
Martin Bean and myself weren't 'underground' and 'punk rock' enough.  I
told him he can be as 'punk rock' as he wants to be- shove meat up his
OWN ass, wreck his OWN shit, and put his OWN body in danger, but the
moment he crossed over that, he was nothing more than an asshole.  A
drunk, fucking psychologically disturbed asshole.  He finally agreed to
pay for whatever damages he was responsible for, as well as rebuild the
tent he destroyed, and clean up the mess he left.  He yelled and
screamed that we should have known that this was going to happen, but I
asked him that if that were truly the case, why the fuck would we allow
him to do this at the sound system that WE built.  Our knowledge was
that he was going to do some crazy shit, but that nothing that was
someone else's property was going to be broken and the tent was going to
stay intact.  Though he agreed that he'd cover all of the costs so that
the generator would be put back on, the more incorrigible and
argumentive he became about it being turned off in the first place.  He
simply could not see what it was that he did that was truly wrong.  He
just thought that we couldn't deal with what it was he was doing-
getting naked, puking, spitting meat and putting it in his ass.  The
fact is, many of us had already seen it, and it was much more disgusting
a few weeks before when we saw it the first time.  So, how he surmised
that we couldn't deal with it in it's lesser form this night was just
stupid.

Anyways, the sound would have went back on, but Dan's own mouth kept it
off.  Things were more or less squashed, and although we all thought he
was an asshole for doing what he did, we were going to turn it all back
on.  Dan just wouldn't shut the fuck up about how we were all a bunch of
pussies, so everyone more or less left him there to swill more beer with
the few stoolies who remained to laugh at his stupid antics.  A few
people attempted to clean up the site and rebuild the tent so that
things could continue the next day, but dan came back and knocked it all
back down... even making sure to fuck up the poles the were needed to
keep it intact.  Again, dan crossed the line between shocking and
totally disrespectful.  Most insulting is the fact that he disrespected
the very people who allowed him to rise to this 'stature'... his
friends, all involved in the sound system, and even Drop Bass.  Though
rumors abound and dan denies nearly everything, it is known that after
what happened at the bean/massive system, he went on to spray paint
'fuck you' in the mens bathroom, piss in the hot tub that was set up
nearby, call kurt a 'cunt', tear down the fencing in front of the dj in
the main room and get in numerous fights.  If anyone here really thinks
any of this was cool, i pity you as much as i pity him.

By the next morning (sunday) the wooden wall we had built was collapsed
and the site was swarming with flies.  It smelled really bad.  At some
point, Dan had collapsed with his foot bleeding and finally went to
sleep.  He woke up the next day at around 4:00pm, and was immediately
resilient about his actions.  He wasn't up for more than an hour before
he began arguing with me about the sound being turned off again, as well
as the fact that while he slept, we cleaned up the site and put all the
equipment back in the U-Haul truck.  He still couldn't understand what
'our' problem was.  We drove the U-Haul and my truck up to near the
front gate and resettled camp, letting dan sit in his own filth.  We
didn't want anything to do with him, nor did we feel we had to explain
our actions to him.  If he couldn't get the concept of disrespect
through his head, that was for him to work out.

I was asked by some of the DBN crew what was going to happen with our
mess, and i explained that everything was more or less cleaned up, with
the exception of a huge pile of wood that we figured we'd burn but Kurt
said that the spaceowners would get pissed about.  I explained that
everyone except dan had cleaned up everything, and as a matter of
principle, he should at least have to load the wood on a truck and haul
it to the main fire or the dumpsters.  When a truck was sent down, he
refused to help, saying that it wasn't his mess.  It wasn't until Kurt
went down himself that dan helped pick it up.

It wasn't long before this that an unnamed listmember presented dan with
a full bottle of Jack Daniels.  Though it was in good fun, i think that
this was the fuse that re-lit the dan drama for sunday night.  By
nightfall, dan was back at it again, and after being told repeatedly by
security to quiet down, he was given one last chance.  He then threw a
beer bottle at the security that told him to quiet down.  (on a side
note, a beer bottle also broke Johnsin's windshield on this night...
john's car and my truck were parked next to each other, and this is
where dan was planted for nearly two hours... make your own conclusion
on this one)  so, upon the bottle throwing, they went and got kurt, and
it took nearly 15 people to flush dan out and take him up the hill,
where he was told he had to leave.  because he and the guys who he came
with were too drunk to drive, they were allowed to sit by dan's car near
the gate until they sobered up and then leave.


again, if you really think any of this saga is really all that cool, i
really feel sorry for you.  though being extreme and freaking people out
is somewhat admirable for those willing to make as big of fools of
themselves in public, fucking up people's property is not.  as of today,
dan has yet to understand this, and still refuses to come to terms to
how big of an asshole he was this weekend to a lot of people and their
property.  and so, as of today, dan doormouse is in no way associated
with massive magazine.  the store 'massive record source' is his own
business, but it has nothing to do with us.  he took the name for his
use as any person who is involved with the magazine is allowed for their
own ventures, but the store has nothing to do with massive magazine.  he
told me it would be too big of a pain to change the name, and that i can
understand, but let there be no confusion that it has nothing to do with
us.  he will no longer be writing for massive either.  while there isn't
too much damage that can be done (other than slander) by writing, i
don't need a disrespectful out of control alcoholic that doesn't take
responsibility for his actions representing the magazine while he shoves
meat in his butt and pukes on people.  there are better ways to make
changes in our scene.  shocking people doesn't always make people
think.  pissing them off and wrecking or disrespecting their stuff just
makes them hate you.


dan said that he and the members of meat had this planned from the
beginning.  that this more or less was going to be their official 'fuck
off' to the rave scene.  he said he has bored of the scene and that he
has bored of playing for the people that show up.  his store services
this crowd, so i don't really see what he's talking about, but his logic
hasn't made a whole lot of sense recently.  i asked him if he was going
to change the format of the store to fit his newfound musical tastes and
lifestyle- maybe a butcher shop cum gg allin shrine -but he really
wouldn't give me an answer.  apparently he's disgusted of the scene only
up to the point where he can make money off of it.  he doesn't care who
he pissed off or if what he has done means that he'll never get another
booking.  time will tell....


at this point, i still consider dan a friend, but i doubt i'd ever trust
him around any of my property.  i feel that such a public act by
himself, followed by the public reaction, merits a public explaination
from myself.  it's unfortunate that all of the work that all of the work
put into furthur by so many people was overshadowed by the idiocy of one
person (our system and setup was the only true 'theme-camp' until dan
destroyed it).  many people put a lot of their own time and money into
making Furthur a mindblowing event only to have it forgotton or worse
yet, destroyed, by Dan Doormouse.

What he did was _not_ cool.... and only consequences will make him
(maybe) see why what he did this weekend was so fucked up.  His 'fun'
was attained at the cost of other people's misery and loss.  Had he kept
it under control, what he did would have been merely shocking, instead
of overtly insulting.

Well, Hossam and I travelled 4 1/2 hours from Cleveland to Toronto this past weekend for
one of the best parties I have been to in a long, long time. After meeting up with some
friends at the hotel, we arrived at the party at about 12:45-1am. There was a very
organized, thorough search at the door. Some people complain about this, but I actually
don't mind thorough searches. I appreciate the fact that the promoters are concerned
with the safety of the people coming into the party as well as their own liabilities. 

The party was held at a club called Shock (or something like that) about 10 minutes away
from our hotel outside of the city. The main room was really big and really loud, but we
were looking for the jungle room. As soon as we got in, Cynthia, Hossam, and I quickly
found the jungle room and found a camp spot for ourselves next to the pillar near the 
left speaker stack. I rarely left that spot the whole night: only to go to the bathroom,
get water, and take pictures! (I have only one complaint about this party and I'll get
it out of the way now. Women's bathrooms MUST MUST MUST be stocked with TP. Sometimes I
remember to bring a roll myself, but come on...Also, the club turning off the cold water
for a while is just evil. Luckily we had brought enough money to keep ourselves
stocked.)

The
jungle room seemed to be about the same size as the main room, and when we got in there
it was packed. Mystical influence and Sniper were tagteaming when we got there, and
within a bit, Andy C came on. I can't really comment on the djs very descriptively
anymore because it's been a while, and it's becoming a blur, but I can make some general
statements. Andy C was wicked. Great tracks, smooth mixing. Mc GQ was also really great
and got the crowd going completely nuts. Randall followed and althoguh Randall also had
really great records, his mixing was not as smoothed and I noticed a few really crappy
mixes that were soon corrected. There was nothing really distinctive that I can remember
about Shimon, Red One and Freedom. Just the fact that there was unbelieveabley good
jungle pummeling me all night. Fierce came on after these guys, and although it had to
be about 6 in the morning, he was still pounding out a hard set. I am sure he was just
playing the set he had planned to play at his scheduled peak time slot. That's okay
though b/c the tracks were great. Again, his mixing was not terrific, but from what I
hear, he was very apologetic about it and attributed it to being very very tired and
overextended. Dieselboy (& Flipside) followed Fierce and closed out the night. As usual,
very smooth mixing, still dropping great tracks althoguh still not "morning jungle".
At this time, my mind was telling me I had to dance because who knows when I would be
able to hear this kind of D&b again, but I was so tired all I
could do was dance in my seat, but by the end of his set, Damian got me up and dancing
again :) The party did not end until about 9 or 9:30am, I can't remember. 

 Ended the night closed circle: dancing. I can't express to you how wonderful this
party was for me. It was something that I *needed*. Living in Cleveland, it is not often
that we get to hear quality jungle when the price is right, and there is an absence of
any regular d&b events or weeklies. In addition, there is such a HUGE difference between
Canada and Northeastern Ohio. This d&b room was PACKED nearly ALL night (it started
thinning out around the time Fierce came on, but I think it had more to do with the time
than the music!) People here SEARCHED out the jungle room instead of leaving or
complaining when they heard it. The crowd was so hyped up, screaming, jumping, waving
their hands in the air, lighters, whistles, horns, oh my gawwwsssh...I thought I had
died and gone to heaven. Seriously. No one was sitting down in the middle of the dance
floor or in front of the speakers. If people wanted to sit, they sat close to the
pillars on the floor or lining the walls of the room. There was barely *any* attitude.
People think that jungle is all about ganstas and hardasses, and this is totally not
true at all. Maybe it has that reputation in the US, but in Canada it was all about
smiling, moving to the music, and feeling the bass. The party lasted soooooo long.
Usually parties fly by, but this one seemed to be hyper-extended. that's a good thing. I
never wanted it to end. Unfortunately, it did. We left the party at about 9:30am, and on
the way home some dumbass rearended us on a slippery incline in the rain. Don't worry,
no one's hurt..but what a way to end an awesome night. 

Thanks to everyone who made this party and this weekend possible for me. You know who
you are.  I had a wicked, wicked time in Toronto, got to chill with some really
great friends and hear some mindblowing drum&bass. Such a great time, I am in
withdrawal! I hope that someday maybe people in Cleveland will come to _understand_ the way
I did this weekend.

and my friends thought it was hilarious, ppl need to chill.

"especially for us people who really do enjoy beer" 

hahahaha like im singling beer drinkers out...i imagine you sitting holding
the phone yelling 'why!? why would they fool me like this?! i just wanted
some sweet deleicious beer! (oh the humanity...)"

Speaking of which, is that show sold out.  If so, does anyone know anyone
that might want to sell two tickets, at least?

they are also doing a show in nyc (in addition to dc and detroit)


i would highly recommend going to the detroit show as its the closest and
by educated guess will most likely by the best...(one of the main
influences on the detroit sound playing in detroit, think about it)

peace,

Let me explain exactly where the bar I'm talking about is located.  There
are 3 or 4 bars in Trilogy, so I want to make sure everyone is on the same
page.  There is a stage in the main room of Trilogy.  I'm not talking
about raised blocks or caged dancing women stages, I mean the main stage. 
It's at one end of the main room.  The bar where the net meet should occur
is at the exact opposite end of this stage.  It's all the way down.  Once
you reach the end of Trilogy's main room, you'll see steps leading up to a
door.  Go through the door and you'll be in a bar.  This is physically a
separate room from the main room.  It's fairly small and has a glass wall
that allows you to see the goings on in the main room.  There is a bar and
couches and stools in this room.  There is also another mini room in this
bar up some additional stairs.  I suggest we *don't* meet in this part
because it's too dark and often being used by couples doing, er, couples
things. 

Let's meet right by the bar at midnight.  Is this cool?

Now, Rob had initially suggested that we have our own special room for a
meeting.  Is this a possibility?  Also, who was doing the list of
participants?  Is this still viable?

Keep the ball rolling . . .

Braden

<P>YES, WE NEED MORE STUDIES BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE REALISTIC -Learn 
about
and accept the risks - there is no such thing as the perfect drug.


I have only a couple of points to make about your paper.

1. I still have never seen any study that shows MDMA causes any kind
of axon damage in humans in a normal dosage range. Even with MDA, the
amount is over twice what you would need to achieve the desired effect.

2. Many of the human studies base their claims of damage on lowered
serotonin levels, which has not been proven to indicate damage.

3. And most importantly, there has not been a single study that shows 
any
kind of health or behavioral changes in long-term users of these drugs. 
So
even if there are some neurotoxic effects, what actual harm is being 
done?

-Az

PS. I happened to stumble across a reference to a study that showed that
the damage caused by high doses of MDA can be completely blocked by the
action of DXO. In case you didn't know, DXO is the major metabolite(and 
half
of the reason you get fucked up) of DXM. DXM is a common ingredient in 
cough
remedies and a hallucinogen at high doses (see 
http://www.frognet.net/dxm )

Yo,

I'm sure you all have had parental problems about going to raves. I mean,
they
see it on 20/20 or some shit like that and worry their asses off. News
shows like 20/20,
when they have had rave-stories, have showed when people have died from
the use of
drugs such as e. 

I don't do drugs. I have before, I still smoke pot a tiny bit sometimes,
but why does my mother
think that since other people do it, that i will do it.

At raves, I have never been pressured to do drugs. If i want to do them,
I do them, if I am offered them
and I don't want them, I refuse polietly and the person shuts up about
it. 

I told my mom this (the i am never pressured) and she still thinks that
it's horrible to goto raves.
She is worried that i'll be picked up or something (her words, "picked
up.")

ok, anyone have any advice to tell her?

carl.

(anyone know any stores around cleveland [i'm from chardon] that deal in
vinyl, I know of one)

Just passing the word along.  It's short notice but Dustin will be
spinning tonight (June 4) at the Club Cafe on the South Side in
Pittsburgh.  It's free to get in and this is a kick off for a series of
nights at the same location.  Starts at 10 pm. It's behind Jack's right
off of Carson.

OK once again rumors have taken hold .  There are several ways of
measuring seritonin neutotoxcity - not all of these "just measure
amounts of seritonin" please read my sources and other journals for
yourself so you don't sound too foolish.  There are problems with some
of the tecniques used to determine damage and these are explained in one
of the articles I reviewed.  Also please understand that we can't test
on humans and monkeys etc. may be completely different than us.  As for
functional consequences - look at the article I referanced from
addiction magazine - it is a feild study showing functional problems
from use- not the best source but something to review - also we do not
know if continued use will lead to amplified functional problems later
on such as parkison's disease. (sorry can't spell)

Anyways, you are and are not correct - I would appreciate a referance
for "Facts" given because not everything you find on the net is true -
There is a lot of slanted info that is not peer reviewed.

no disrespect intended, lov, -N-

<P>YES, WE NEED MORE STUDIES BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE REALISTIC -Learn 
about
and accept the risks - there is no such thing as the perfect drug.


I have only a couple of points to make about your paper.

1. I still have never seen any study that shows MDMA causes any kind
of axon damage in humans in a normal dosage range. Even with MDA, the
amount is over twice what you would need to achieve the desired effect.

2. Many of the human studies base their claims of damage on lowered
serotonin levels, which has not been proven to indicate damage.

3. And most importantly, there has not been a single study that shows 
any
kind of health or behavioral changes in long-term users of these drugs. 
So
even if there are some neurotoxic effects, what actual harm is being 
done?

-Az

PS. I happened to stumble across a reference to a study that showed that
the damage caused by high doses of MDA can be completely blocked by the
action of DXO. In case you didn't know, DXO is the major metabolite(and 
half
of the reason you get fucked up) of DXM. DXM is a common ingredient in 
cough
remedies and a hallucinogen at high doses (see 
http://www.frognet.net/dxm )

another technique is to put a bud stem down in the hole that's big

well, i gotta disagree with that.

do any of you remember what it is like to be 12? i do, that was just
fuckin yesterday for me, so ill offer some insights into the
impressionable young minds of 12 year olds...

see the problem is that there aren't enough big brothers and sisters
telling their siblings what's up. when the question about substance
use arises @ the rave, that's a perfect time to tell her (hold your to
your hat) THE TRUTH! ...that drugs are a lot of fun and she should
start using them as soon as possible (...but seriously folks :) -- no,
really that's a perfect time to tell her THE TRUSH: that drugs + raves
don't go hand in hand, and that's you dont need drugs to enjoy raves,
or life for that matter.

and it's not just raves + drugs, but drugs in general. who would you
rahter a 12 year old learn from about drugs?:
(a) her big sister who knows what's up (no lies)
                or
(b) the kids @ school (lies) and the d.a.r.e. program (lies). 

how can (b) be a better answer? please tell me.

if i had a "big sister who knew what's up" who could have told me, my
life might be very different right now.

when i went to my first rave (@ age 13) i was all alone. i didn't know
a single person, and the feeling that i got was that drugs + raves
went hand in hand. i thought it was a package deal. that would have
been sorted out right away if i had someone to look up to that could
tell me the way things really were. 

here's something else to think about: my boy's little brother (age 12,
smokes weed sometimes cause he's tryin to be cool like dat) and i were
chillin alone temporarily, and he asked me, possibly because he was
afraid to ask his brother about it and also because he looks up to me
as a big brother #2 in a sense: "have you ever done acid? i think i
want to try that" with this look in his eyes that i recognized,
because @ age 12 i had the exact same look in my eyes when i asked the
same question to a 17 year old  (that's crazy, i just realized i was
in the exact same situation, but with me takin the place of the
younger of the two)... and i thought at the time it was best to
[white] lie to the kid and say "no, i havent" (that's where the lie
stops) "but that's not the kind of drug you should be at all thinking
about taking at this point in your life. wait about four years, find
out everything you can about it, and then make the decision". the
reply i got when i asked the question was more along the line of
"yeah... it's really cool, you should try some with me next weekend!
check this porno out! those are some large titties!"  anyways, i cant
think of a better example of why it is important to chose choice (a)
over (b). well, whatever, i hope you all can see what i'm tryin to
say.. its not just important in this instance, but just in general.

I'm 28, but my mother would freak if she knew I did that.  If you think it
is easier as you get older, you are mistaken.  Mom's will worry..that is
just in their nature.  Just try to give her as little a reason to worry as
possible and your life will be easier.

well i saw ritm 2-3 yrs ago, they didnt impress me musically.  just an
observation about it:  the guy doing the music was tucked back in the
corner in the dark, some ppl didnt even know he was there really...   guess
why?  coz theres some silly guy in silly outfits jumping around the stage
and crowd with the spotlights pointed at him the whole time.  its kinda
like the ppl that think the prodigy is this green-haired-bozo-the-clown
clone.....

True about the different taste, but don't you think the ASH IN YOUR MOUTH

I know everyone is all for cubase or cakewalk or maybe another one, but I'm
stuck with Goldwave on shareware, and I don't have the bandwidth to d/l
anything else.  Does anyone else use this?  Is there a win95 version out?
Any tricks of the trade I should know about?  btw - I should have my first
track done tomorrow, and if my friends w/ some decent musical taste approve,
I'll put it on a web page or something.  It's sorta all over the map -
jungle, ambient, and even some industrialish techno.  You'll hear (or not).

Hey all :) First of all, I can't wait till tomorrow night , not so much
for Josh Wink...mostly cuz I get to meet you peeps! Anywhoo...I'll be
wearing dark green kinda-cargo pants and a black FUCT hooded
sweatshirt...I'll also most likely have a pb-cle logo taped on the center
of my chest :) I'll be with my buddy...long hair...goatee..your basic
Jesus Christ haircut...and that's where my question is: If there's a VIP
guest list thingy, is he going to be able to get into the room or
whatever? I would certainly hope so..

brian

ps..btw, I'm 6'3" with short dark hair..for identification purposes :)

the most current info for Family Affair 4 can be found on the underground
peace website @ http://www.undergroundpeace.com. According to that site,
DJThrilla was right and it is supposed to be held at a campground in southeast
Ohio near Athens. Also, at that site you can get the mail-order form for
advance tickets, which will save you some loot. If you wanna order tickets,
hurry! That cheapest you can get them is $25 I think, but that deadline is
JUNE 9TH. Just thought I'd pass on the info :)

The music sucked. The people were dancing like they were at
a club. Where were the kids? Everyone looked like they were in
their mid-twenties. Favorite quote 'Aren't overdoses common at raves?' 
Overall, it was pretty bad.

The last I heard it was 488-8702.  They might have changed it by now.

I only got the first half of it.  I thought it was a riot.  I mean,
who still says "score" when they're trying to find stuff?   I was
watching it with Andy (Sine) and he was getting really pissed off at
the depiction of the scene.  He said they should have put a disclaimer
at the end.  I don't suppose they did?  Anyway, what happened at the
end?

That really puts a bad image upon the scene.  Now i do agree that TV is a
bad influence on everybody watching.

When I went back to Colorado in Dec. - Jan. I got an invite to see
Keioke spin at a club in Denver but I was too sick- I think he may still
be spinning there weekly.  Anyways he is in Colorado a lot and I saw him
do a pretty nice set at Club Millenium in Bolder.

Is it just me, or does anyone else think that the new Plastikman album 
is absolutely and completely lackluster?

After two of the most innovative and creative albums ('Sheet One' and 
'Muzik'), 'Consumed' sounds like a bad, repetitive techno fugue which 
isn't even brilliant to repeat in the first place.

I was so excited when I saw it at Borders I couldn't resist dropping the 
$15.99 or whatever insane price they wanted for it.  (Pittsburgh needs 
some cheap record stores like Boston did...)  When I brought it home I 
was expecting some serious Richie mash-up-yer-know panning, filtering 
and layering Plastikman bizness but instead ... well ... what do you all 
think.

Personally, and I have no hesitancy saying this, personally I think the 
new album sucks.

ps: peak the new email address... my college really wanted to get rid of 
me after graduation-- they cancelled my email address already-- fOk!

i think consumed is excellent.  i think it starts from where his older fuse
material left off, with a much darker atmosphere.  i don't think richie is
obliged to make everything he puts out have 4/4 kick drums, does he?

How about a backup plan, in case our friends aren't allowed in? Like meet
outside underneith the windows of that upstairs bar? It's never very
crowded in that area...two net meet times perhaps? First under the windows
at like 12...then at 12:30 we'll try and go inside the VIP area...that way
if we can't have our friends come in, we still have the pictures and still
got to meet everyone...sound like a plan?

Ooh, I think it sounds nothing like Fuse...
have you really given it plenty of listens?  The first night I had it, I 
fell asleep to it (on purpose-- i put it on repeat and went to sleep) 
and a few times during the night when I woke up briefly between dreams 
or what not i thought to myself, "fuck, is this the same track?"

tonight we're hosting a special event called TRANSPLANT, culminating a
special relationship between ele_mental and a few select toronto DJs who
have managed to stay real in an increasingly mainstream scene. 

dave cooper, adam marshall, moonstarr, frankie gunns, and crispin plan to
bring the house down with their diverse mixtures of minimal techno, deep
house, hardcore drum'n'bass, and funky trip hop.  you won't hear a bad
record all night!  (imho ;)

admission is only $7.00, with music from 11 PM - 7 AM.

located at the WASABI warehouse, 401 dublin ave.  we know it's a
played-out space but is this all about MUSIC or new spaces???  ask yerself
and you'll know the answer...

to get to wasabi, in case you didn't already know:

get to i-71 and find i-670 (the E/W highway just N of downtown).  take 670
W to the neil ave exit, go L at the 1st light, then S for 1/2 mile to
dublin ave.  take a R on dublin ave, then go 2 blocks to corner of dublin
and hanover, and there's the space, on the L.  enter in the rear. 


bring exact change and your own water if you can.


ps- this will be the final ele_mental event for a while (with a few minor
exceptions)

That would make a great sample for a tune...

NY Undercover is always trying to promote itself by appealin' to the kids,
with the hiphop soundtrack....i can see the next episode...

Cop 1: "You know them junglists, they all smoke crack."
Cop 2: "Yeah....and the shove steaks up their ass.  That's all you need to
        know."

;)

I always try to watch they shows that attempt to portray the 'cool kids'
I think they know that us watching their crappy portrayals of ravers will
get us to watch just as much as a good one - *and* get people talking
more.   Some kind of bizarro marketing trickery.

You know, It might be me, but what is the deal with the VIP room?  I can
understand all of us trying to have a net meet to put some faces with the names,
but isn't making it exclusive kind of the antithesis of what our whole scene is
supposed to be about-inclusion not exclusion?

I think whoever is really behind this whole thing, Rob, I think this means you,
needs to take a step back and analyze their priorities.

To me, It just gives the whole scene a sour taste.

Brian's idea is what I vote for.  12:00 under and 12:30 inside. Also, so
as not to make things too complicated for Rob, let's have a guest list cut
off time of 5:00.  Cool?

hey kids...

if anyone wants to have a net meet this saturday @ crush, how about we do
it at 1:30am at the following location:

once you walk in the door, there will be someone collecting your tickets on
the left hand side (coz you will already hav bought your tickets in advance
to ensure entry, right?)...you will notice a divider/barrier on your right
hand side. let's meet on the other side of that divider at 1:30am.

so you walk in, tickets collected on left, divider on right, we meet just
on the other side of that divider. if it doesnt make sense now, it willwhen
u get there. oh christ, i'll draw a map.






	^	^							^
	|	|							|
tickets |	|divider (x)						|
	|	|(meet here 1:30am)			(back wall)	|

and re: the vip room thing, y'all need to relax. sheesh :)

rob is being nice and letting you have a chill, seperate area to hang in
and chat and he's offering you free drinks (not sam adams :) !

i mean i dont think he cares who is on the list, he never said it was
exclusive to list members only, blah blah, dont be so quick to freak.

just send the names of whoever you want to be included, and it should be
all good.

it's not exclusionary. the man is offering a special service. appreciate
it.

peace,
hossam

Here is the list so far... unless I hear from you people in the next five
minutes, I am printing it out, and taking it to Trilogy!  Remember, this is

hey there.

i'm looking for a business partner. here's the requirements;

you've got to have $3,000USD that you can invest
you've got to have a working knowledge of Linux at the LEAST.
 the more you know about it, the better your chances.

i'm not gonna tell ya exactly what the business is, since it'll blow most
of yer minds or just piss you off more, so i'll shut up now. anybody who's
interested, please email me PRIVATELY and keep it off the list.

btw; this is not one of those 'sure things.' it is very VERY likely to
take off from the results i got of the initial survey, but it is NOT
definite. ;P

Cool Idea for netmeat... hope to see you all there... I'll be wearing
the bright-ass shirt... I'll be REAL hard to miss :)

Not really much came of the after-party idea... the weather was really
against the idea of an outdoor party, and I've been real busy trying to
move apartments anyways... I dunno... If Crush ends early (say before
6?), anyone's invited to my (spartan cause I'm barely moved in) apt on
Carson St. to listen to seedees if they wanna... just look me up at the
party...

Damn PBS punks!  They don't even know how to use hotmail correkt. ;P
hee-hee...

Anyways, I'll be thar too, probably via PAT transport.  Hopefully it won't
sell out before i get there (digits crossed).

If you don't know me already, I'm probably short to you, and I'll be
wearin' a bright orange shirt.  I'll also have the FINAL PRE-FLYER (ta-da
- collect all three) for LIFE IS BUT A DREAM.  The e-flyer will be coming
soon on that one, so keep huddled up with your keyboard, and grab a dish
to hold your drool for when that comes out.  We'll def have a nice
net-meet type area with some special prizes for all you nice kids. :)

	Wow.  Honestly the best time I've ever had out.  I think I always
went to the parties ( and I normally never talk to anyone ) and just zoned
to the music.  People can be all sarcastic about PLUR, but last night, it
was there.
	I really do have this bitter view of people in general, like most
people are bad.  Maybe it stems from bad public school experiences? But my
friend Dave and I ended up meeting some of the nicest people.  I feel
lucky to run into one person like I did last night in a year.  Last night
I met so many friendly, happy, great people...specifically Braden, Steve
and Rob.  Plus Steve's friend...whom I can't remember his name...ack!
Honestly, it really has changed a lot of views that have been rooted deep
inside me.  My friend Dave called it the best night of his life, and we've
had some great times.  It was just absolutly perfect, I wouldn't change a
thing.  Thank you Braden so much for the water and just a great pleasent
dispositon that you naturally have.  I know that sounds wierd, but it's
true. :) You're just so damn pleasent to hang around with! Thank you Steve
for overall great conversation and for giggling with Dave and I for hours,
and asking Dave tough questions about the FBI...that was hysterical.  And
Rob..thank you SO much for getting a picture of Freaky-Feather-Lady! You
have no idea how much I appreciated that! The picture came out great!
	Wow. That's all that can be said about the night I had...and it
was all about meeting a bunch of truly great people.  I definitly hope to
see you guys again.  It's great to put faces to the names!

peace,

brian

ps..where should I send the scanned pictures from last night to get them
    on hyperreal?

Hehe, actually. I cant really simpathize with you, my parents missed 
woodstock and they figure I have the right to make up for it.  Every since 
I was 16 ive been going to raves and tripping. The first time I told my mom 
I was tripping she told me to go to my room and stare at the walls and tell 
her when I was done so we could talk about it.

HOWEVER! I have had to deal with friends parents who are no where near as 
understanding and the only thing you can really do (if all there is is you) 
is convince them that you know that drugs are bad for you and you dont want 
to do them. (Even if this is a lie :)  And leave it at that. From my 
experience most parents are already set in their ways of what is right and 
wrong for their children and regardless of how long a discussion goes on 
each party will have made their decisions and you are gaining no ground. 
You either gotta follow what they say and not go or go against what they 
say and deal with the consequences (if you get caught).  Woohoo, im 
corrupting the youth! Breakin the law, breakin the law.

Another possibility is somehow showing them that you are under 'adult 
supervision'.  Do you have any friends that are of legal age that know your 
parents and go to raves? Basically the other alternative is aranging some 
sort of shaperone.  Unless of course you want to take your parents TO the 
rave. :) Ill stop by and say hi and dance for them. :)

Yo,

I'm sure you all have had parental problems about going to raves. I mean,
they
see it on 20/20 or some shit like that and worry their asses off. News
shows like 20/20,
when they have had rave-stories, have showed when people have died from
the use of
drugs such as e.

I don't do drugs. I have before, I still smoke pot a tiny bit sometimes,
but why does my mother
think that since other people do it, that i will do it.

At raves, I have never been pressured to do drugs. If i want to do them,
I do them, if I am offered them
and I don't want them, I refuse polietly and the person shuts up about
it.

I told my mom this (the i am never pressured) and she still thinks that
it's horrible to goto raves.
She is worried that i'll be picked up or something (her words, "picked
up.")

ok, anyone have any advice to tell her?

carl.

(anyone know any stores around cleveland [i'm from chardon] that deal in
vinyl, I know of one)

HeLLLLL yeaHHHHH!!!!! ;-) I had an incredible time also. Everything seemed to
work out really well, and everyone seemed to have a great time. I loved
meeting those of you that I did meet for the first time, and for those of you
I have already met, it was great to see you again!! Let's see if I can
remember the people that I met for the first time: Brian (and Dave), Lisa,
Nicole, and I think that may be it for those I met for the first time. I also
saw and/or hung out with Amy (Funkybizz), Steve (DaPwezz), Stevie T, Braden,
Trouty, Todd (Hednist), Eric (JunglAlien) and Luke (Weareone). If I forgot
somebody, sorry, I am bad with names to begin with, and I am amazed I
remembered THAT much!! :-)  I thought Josh had a great set, personally. I have
heard others comment that it wasnt his best, and maybe so, but I danced my
geriatric ass off for nearly the entire 3 and a half hour set.  The lighting
was fun: those of you there, do you remember the blue spiral lights on the
floor near the stage? I dont know WHY I was so fascinated with them, oh well.
It was great getting the opportunity to hang out with everyone in the art bar,
it was so nice and cool in there, the drinks were tasty, josh was a cool guy
to meet, the "spiced" fruit was yummy, and did anyone else feel like you were
in the tropical rainforest with the plants all hanging in your face and laps?
hehe... Amy (Funkybizz) and I especially had a hilarious time (once we found
eachother), just being the dance flo' ho's that we are. We spend most of the
time laughing our asses off at eachother anyway, we probably dont notice
everyone laughing....er...umm....WITH us.  :-) Okay. Well enough said. I had a
fun night. Thank you Rob for making this possible. Keep it up. I look very
much forward to another night like Friday!  Peas and carrots... Casey

parents know, i don't smoke ((i quit really mom, really i did)) i don't even
know what Extasy is let alone LSD...since i found out about raves "bowling"
has become my sport of choice as far as my parents know ....

....."i'm goin bowling and Perkins mom, yeah i'll be home by 5 tomorrow, and i
promise i will go to bed at a decent hour....i dont know why bowling wears me
out mom...must be all the second hand cigarette smoke...goes right to the
brain..... why am i dressed up?...um...oh you know us kids......yes mom there
will be an adult with us all night....no boys, i know,..... no mom, i haven't
started smoking again.....yes my homeworks done....
...i wont be late.....{exit stage left}"

oh and not to mention, i *just* got ungrounded after five weeks (*yay* it was
only five weeks this time, not six).....hmmm..

well...that's my story....just felt the need to share....bored....need more
coffee....need another cigarette...
..damn us youngins no respect....no knowledge, we're spoiled, uninformed.....
...well so was everyone else at our age....so damn us kids and you damn us
all....soon, perhaps we'll be you....maybe...
maybe, being here, seeing what good can from this "scene" can help us from
becoming one more washed out lawyer, or caffateria maid....who knows.....
maybe i'm just tired from inhuman sleeping paterns (one i was born with, not
created from partying, god bless insomnia :)
oh well just my thoughts.....just my babbling....

Crush mini review.

Before the party, I asked like 6 different people whom I trust their
opinions about what this would be like and they all pretty much said
"Small, hot and humid space, good ass music good ass vibe, it'll be a
fun time" I think that was the perfect description too... I had a REALLY
good time. I danced soooo damn much, another one of those "If I'm
standing I'll dance" type parties, the only way I could stop dancing was
to sit down :) The music was right on... alot of really nice break beat.
I didn't really get into the first half hour of the music, but after
that, it was the bomb all night. The lineup was really well laid out, it
was pretty much smooth-transition to smooth-transition between DeeJays.
These guys really know how to throw a party. That space is WAY hot, but
still I had an awesome time... They had one of those nifty evaporative
water air-conditioners, which really saved the night. It broke down
about 4 or 5am tho, but the door was really cool about letting you go
outside and chill out. I'm glad it wasn't like 80 degree weather outside
or the heat might have been unbearable. I saw a LOT of my friends
there... unfortunately I didn't see many of my femme friends, first rave
for me in a while that I went through the whole night without a backrub
:( The vibe was really tight, PLUR was in full effect, some guy came up
to me by the bathroom and was like "You're an awesome dancer man, how
old are you?" hehehe... that was pretty cool cause whenever I dance I
usually stair at the floor to avoid tripping on people and stuff lying
around, last night I kept looking up and seeing people staring at me...
you wonder if they are like "Damn that dude doesn't know how to dance"
or if they're just tripping out on your footwork or whatever. At any
rate, even if he was just humoring me (or hitting on me?), I felt better
about busting a move :) I must have danced like 4 hours total... I was
really making an effort to pace myself and not get soaking w/sweat or
get BO heheh :) but I just couldn't stop dancing... to me that's the
sign of a good party. I inhaled a TON of black stuff, all in my nose and
my lungs tho... I think it was from the AC kicking up all the dust, but
damn that seemed like the equivalent of a year of smoking cigarettes.

I tried the Herbal E btw, a brand called "Cloud 9 X"... It's pretty damn
powerful... seemed like a cross between tripping and rolling this kind
is huge blue horse-pills that you only need to take one of, costs $20
for 4 at slackers... one did the job for me. I dunno though, everything
I read about herbal E indicates it's more dangerous than the real thing.
Apparently the active ingredient is going to be banned soon. I've cut
way back on rolling anyways though cause it's trashing my sleep
schedule, keep getting up late for work... so no biggy.

My body is SOOOO tired...


Thanks for throwing a great party :)

This may be silly, but is seratonin similar inany way to melatonin?  this
brings up my next question: would it be possible to take seratonin
supplements so as not to fuck up all those levels in your head?

The NoGuestList -> DownLow <- HouseOfStyles Saga unfolds

I about dropped my jaw when I heard this last night.

This is kinda a pieced together story, feel free to correct me if you
know more/better, but this is the gist of it as I understand it.

NGL has quit.

HOS is throwing remix-a-matosis instead of NGL.

DownLow will be doing promotion of remix-a-matosis for HOS.

Remix-a-matosis will NOT be held at the crane.


Is that fucking whacked out or what? I guess Darren/Rich fell out, but
then DownLow and HOS got everything smoothed out and are going to be
throwing remix-a-matosis instead... John was handing out flyers for
remix-a-matosis (I think they still said NGL on them as well)

What a soap-opera, boy I'd have loved to have been a fly on the wall the
last few days :)

Rumor has it that remix-a-matosis might be at this new space BIGGER than
the Crane, but south of Pittsburgh like 20 minutes, and 2 rooms! I hear
that MAYBE DJ Smoov will be spinning there too... I'm so psyched... I
only saw him spin once at Zythos and I loved his set.

Big up to John / HOS, glad to hear the rumors of HOS's death are greatly
exaggerated :) Still, it would be nice to see NGL stay with it and throw
more parties, I had alot of fun at Digital Genesis, I dunno if they
could pull it off without DownLow though? Hopefully we'll see :)...
(Please NGL do NOT get local13 involved, I hate them with a passion for
what they did at AF2) More parties is always better IMHO (except for
irresponsible raver-killers like April Foolz 2 ).

month way!>, but all the rest i heard was some nice stuff...i didn't make
it to the last sessions one - that space was quite on the illuminati hq

Thanks to all who helped in participating and promoting that snappy
hand-clappin event.  It did get a bit hot but the the ventilation and
natures' forces kept things chill.  The tight but very danceable space made
a lot out of the lighting and the crowd was hype. Big thanks to the
netter's i met for the first time um cant remember names too well but dan,
cutup and of course dj kali(sp?) for the ravers breakfast of champions!
woohoo

unless I'm wrong (which isn't that improbable) melatonin is a skin pigment,
while seratonin is a neurotransmitter.  A happy neurotransmitter at that,

You mean like if you won the lottery, got very ecstatic, and then took 
an e pill?  Yeah, you'd still feel it.  Being naturally happy, even if 
incredibly so, does not cause NEARLY as high a release of serotonin as 
something like MDMA.  However, if you were to take e one day, and then 
take it the next -- the second day would not be nearly as strong as the 
first.  And, if you took e every day for a week, by the end of the week 
you would feel none of the warm, lovey effects and only speediness.  

Incidentally, many people notice feeling slightly irritable a couple 
days after having taken e, because of serotonin depletion (it does 
eventually creep back up to close to regular levels, though.  However, 
even if you feel totally 'back to normal' in say, three days after 
having taken e -- just one use has been shown to lower serotonin levels 
for up to one year.  This isn't really something major to worry about, 
though, since you aren't going to *feel* any differently).  Being really 
natually happy, however, does not mean that any irritabiliy will result 
a couple days later, or that taking e would have any less of an effect.

--Amanda

P.S. -- Melanin is the skin pigment.  Melatonin helps regulate sleep (in 
this way, sort-of similar to serotonin, since that plays a small role in 
sleep regualtion as well.  Not as much, though)

this is not an attempt to put you down,

however it is an attempt to educate:

my knowledge of melatonin is nil.  the name of skin pigmentation is 
melanin, NOT melatonin  melatonin is some substance marketed through 
stores like GNC to help people relax and concentrate.  serotonin is a 
neurotransmitter;  i.e. y'r brain talks through the stuff.  when one 
experiences the effects of LSD(-25), one's brain is flooded with 
serotonin. this bridges all the synapses in the mind simultaneously, 
allowing unnatural things to happen like hearing color, smelling sounds!

for the record it should be noted that the proper spelling of serotonin 
is exactly as i have spelled it, and the correct spelling of melatonin 
is the same.  i would not go so far as to say that they are not related, 
as my own personal knowledge can neither confirm or deny that.  however, 
they are not spelled remotely similarly.

killin' ignorance 1 brain cell at a time,

Ok, here are a few references (with abstarcts). By the way, 
Parkinson's is caused by extreme damage to the dopagenic(sp?)
neurons, not the serotogenic. Even then only when about 80%
have been badly damaged. There was a designer drug, MPTP, which is
an opiate analog, that could cause massive damage to the opiate
receptors and was responsible for Parkinson's-like symptoms.
Anyway...

Abstract
       A group of self-acknowledged past MDMA users, participants in a 
tryptophan challenge test, were evaluated for a number of possible 
neuropsychological deficits in a battery of tests. There were no
indications of deficit, although some mild memory impairment was 
suggested. This was felt to be inconsequential (the volunteers that just 
recently flown some distances to participate in the tests, and the only 
documented drug common to all subjects was the intentionally 
administered tryptophan. The conclusions, nonetheless, are framed to 
raise concerns about the possible detrimental effects of MDMA use.

Abstract
       Dose-related serotonin depletion in experimental animals is 
tabulated. A comparison of primate results to those reported from rats, 
has allowed an extrapolation to the human MDMA-user. The
conclusion drawn that, as there have been no clear indicators of 
problems with MDMA users, if there is damage in man it may be very 
subtle in nature, possibly lying outside of our present techniques for
detecting it, and possibly being very slow in onset, as compared to the 
rapid consequences seen from the MPTP trauma in the dopaminergic system.

Abstract
       This is certainly the most complete clinical study on the effects 
of MDMA on the normal human subject. A total of 21 normal volunteers 
were administered known amounts of MDMA, orally. The entire
group had analyses of blood chemistry, timed and frequent physiological 
measures, including pulse and blood pressure (for all) and as well as 
neurological and electrocardiographic tests (for some). The neurological 
and electrocardiogram evaluations were continued for 24 hours. . 
Physiologically, all subjects experienced an elevation in blood pressure 
and pulse rate, with a peaking on the average at about one hour. At the 
sixth hour, most subjects were at or below their pre-dose levels, and at 
24 hours all were within their normal ranges. Eye dilation was seen in 
all subjects, more than half had jaw clench and an increased jaw reflex, 
which persisted in one subject to the 24 hour point. Some neurological 
reflexes were enhanced (deep tendon) or equivocal (planter reflex), and 
there were signs of incoordination
(finger-nose testing, gait) in some subjects, giving a strong warning 
against motor vehicle operation. One subject was nauseous, with 
vomiting, but there were no difficulties with either urination or
defecation, and there were neither headaches nor insomnia. Appetite was 
suppressed in all subjects to varying degrees. . At the psychological 
level, all subjects reported a heightened sensual awareness, and three 
reported sexual arousal. It is concluded that MDMA produces remarkably

Abstract
       A group of 30 MDMA users and 28 matched controls with no history 
of MDMA use were studied. The MDMA subjects had lower levels of 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in their cerebrospinal fluid, indicating
some serotonin depletion. At the psychological level, the MDMA users 
showed a decreased impulsivity and hostility, and increased harm 
avoidance and constraint.

Abstract
       In in vivo rat studies with various levels of MDMA and 
dextrorphan, the latter drug, a NMDA antagonist, completely prevented 
the serotonin-depleting action of MDMA.

Hey kidz, I was skimming through all the posts about E, and I thought that I
might be able to add a few cents here and there. See, I'm a virgo, so I'm
really neurotic about what I put into my body and have done quite a bit of
research on this subject (and, consequentally, DO take E, so according to my
findings, it's pretty safe)

Anyways, here is something I wanted to add: someone asked 
>>which leads me to my next q - if some pleasurable experience makes your
brain release serotonin, would that deplete the reserves to the point where
taking an e would have no effect?<<

And the answer is yes. According to a lot of studies that I have read, after a
while regular use of extacy does begin to deplete your body's reserve of
seratonin. AND, after a while, extacy, pure MDMA that is, will no longer begin
to have to same effects on a person who regularly takes the drug. in fact,
here is a little piece I cut off of afairly good extacy information site on
the web:

       Note on Using MDMA Many Times:
Most users of MDMA who have taken the drug many times report that after 
a certain number of sessions, varying by person from a few to a few 
dozen, the desirable effects of the drug are no longer as pronounced. 
Said one, "it loses its magic." Another person who used MDMA perhaps a 
dozen times (separated by weeks to months) noted the dropoff, waited 
three years (!), tried an ordinary dose of high-quality MDMA again, and 
found that the annoyance of the physical side effects outweighed the 
greatly diminished positive effects. He has sadly given up the drug. 
Others who have had fifty or more MDMA sessions still find them to be 
worthwhile on balance. 


Alright, I think this post has gotten just about long enough, but I hope that
you all weren't too bored with what I had to say. Just as a note, if anyone is
interesting in checking out the site on the web for extacy information that I
have found to be most interesting and seemingly accurate, the addy is:
http://www.stack.nl/~snow/xtc/index.html
and if you're at all interested, you might want to check it out.  But finally,
I am bringing this post to a close (anyone breathing a sigh of
relief?...sorry) ALSO, on another note, if anyone is going to Realm of the
Shogun in Dayton this weekend, drop me a personal email, I'm always on the
lookout for comp crazy kidz at parties :)

Herm, I'm wondering why there's not many party reviews anymore? I
remember it used to be like 10 to 20 reviews per party... I love getting
the different perspectives of the same event, it kinda makes me try to
view those perspectives at the next party.

At any rate, I finally met Hossam last night... Now I know why I've
never ran into him before at a party, he's really inconspicuous :) Very
cool, and very smart guy tho, whenever he posts, he seems to have the
most level-headed views of things... was too loud to talk to him much,
or anyone else for that matter. I finally officially met Kay, who I've
kinda seen/known since the early 90s from places like Cloud 9, and every
Pittsburgh rave I've ever been to, was too loud for us to talk either
( Steve (DaPwezz) is really one cool dude... if you don't know him, get
to talk to him more :) It's finally like getting to a point that when I
go to raves I feel like I'm around family... that's cool. I'm gonna try
and get back into the Cleveland thing this weekend... going to
Commencement, and Nocturnal Emission this weekend I think, can anyone
post or email me any info on the promoters of Nocturnal Emission or the
space or anything, predictions? I wanna make sure the next Cleveland
party I go to I have fun :)

My brain is stirring with all kinds of mad plans for Family Affair IV,
so is Steve's... We're pretty much for sure gonna have a sound system...
got speakers and generator lined up, I THINK pat said he could do
amp/turntables/mixer. (Any word Pat?) If not, we'll prolly rent one.
Steve's got alot of other stuff lined up as well... If you haven't
gotten with Steve/Dapwezz (sford1@neo.lrun.com) about this tent circle,
make sure you do cause this is gonna be insane. Also please post or
email any ideas you have for this. I'm not a veteran of multi-day
outdoor rave type parties, if anyone has packing or other general advice
please email me or post that too :)

well i don'y exactly know what the first song i heard was but i do know my
influence, my friend Brian got me hooked on this music. All i have to say
about that is that there's nothing like this type of music and anyone who
trashes it doesn't understand it at all.

What you go on to say is true, however, you did not answer this person's 
question.  The original post was asking if a _normal_ ecstatic 
experience, which would cause a release of serotonin (not e-induced), 
might cause the effects of the e to be lessened.  The answer is 'no.'  

Just wanting to clarify.

>what influenced you to listen to this type of music?

I was lured into techno by way of industrial.  When I started high 
school, oh, back in '91, I started listening to Ministry and Nine Inch 
Nails.  Later, I discovered Front 242 -- and that's what really did it, 
I think.  Then I started listening to (dare I admit) such cheese as 
Lords of Acid ... anyway, I still really like Front 242.  I got into 
stuff like Orbital maybe about two years ago -- so this is still 
relatively new to me, compared to a lot of you who've been listening to 
techno since 'way back when.'  I still think Orbital is the best stuff 
around ... it's more melodic and orchestral than, well, certainly most 
of the stuff played at raves.  I do agree that it's better to dance to 
'dj whoever,' with lots of bass and crazy beats at a party, but that's 
not usually what I'm listening to at home.  And I guess I'm a big dork 
who can't appreciate certain kinds of music, since I think Roni Size is 
boring and repetitive.  

big nerd,
Amanda

yes.  that's why you can't really roll for more than 12 hours @ a time -
no seratonin remains to be excreted.

also.  melanin is the skin pigment you are thinking of.  melatonin is
entirely another thing.  i don't knoww much about it, but it's being

Hey all,
On the 20th of June (till the 27th) i'm heading out to Yosimite, California.
I'm going out on a mountain climbing trip, but i'll be spending some time on
the ground, so i was wondering if anyone had some info on any possible events
during that time...or anything about the area...i dont know the first thing
about the scene or area in general...so any insight would be greatly
appriciated...

thanks 
*hugs*
Jade

Although the "techno/ravish" music today has changed dramatically from whatI
used to consider rave music in the eighties. I still think that my greatest
influences toward my appreciation of this D&B genre' were probably....
Howard Jones, Kraftwerk, DepecheMode, New Order, Front242, and
DJ's like Carlos, GrandMaster Flash, Jungleboy...
As to which came first....hhhmmm... okay, this geriatric pleads "no remember"
which came first. hehehe (Lost in some blurry haze of underground rave scene
of Houston,Tx. in the 80's)---note to self: must have bubble machine.

L8erz all,

influences: depeche mode, new order, erasure, pet shop boys...i know,
cheesy stuff...but hey i still like and listen to all of them...

first real techno cd: in '93 i randomly bought this compilation cd under
the 'trance' section at tower records...i was getting a little tired of
the cheesy dance music i was listening to...so thought i would get
something a little 'harder'...considering all the shit that's out there
in the compilation sections in big chain stores, i really lucked
out...turns out i randomly picked 'harthouse ch.1 - the point of no
return' on eye q records...i still consider it to be one of the best cds
i own...

I was trying for the life of me to remember what it was that got me started 
and this triggered it. It was my first and so far only girlfriend, about 6 
years ago.  She made me a tape of this really cool funky music that seemed 
to just hacked my brain and make me feel funky.  I wish I still had it but 
I spent most all of my allowance trying to find the tapes and cds that that 
had those songs on it.  I know lords of acid lust was part of it cuz I must 
increase my bust was on it (that song still reminds me of her because she 
had really small tits and we used to joke how we should trade cuz I have 
really big ones and I dont want them :)   Umm, it also had the speed racer 
sexual mix, lets get high and have fun (from lords as well) and I wish I 
could remember what else. But that was my first intro into the techno world 
of cd produced music. Prior to that however I had been collecting mods from 
bbs's and playing with tracker. I knew a lot of the medium to high game 
soundtrack programers back then so I was always stealing their shit and 
taping it and listening to it. But I didnt associate mods with techno until 
some of them started sounding similar and finally I started finding mods 
that were remixes/reprograms of real world released tracks.  Dont know 
where it went from there, my tastes stayed with primarly the computer 
(guess its called progressive now adays) stuff like lots of german imports 
(welcome to the technodome) and Dynamix II.  Somewhere in there I found 
house but didnt know it was called house and got sucked into that and now 
im back with house and progressive but with a like for damn near anything. 
 Been learning more and more recently how to manipulate my mind into 
enjoying whatever music is played at a rave.

I would say I was about 10 years old when Herby Hancock came out w/ the song
Rocket...I loved that song. Im not even sure how that song is classified...I
would make up dance routines to it. I think that song influenced me most, I
was always a "dance" music type person. Ofcourse at 10 I didn't even know what
the hell a rave was. What got me into the scene was my first rave, I went
fuckin nuts...the music was like nothing else I had ever heard. My first
"rave" type cd that I bought was the Prodigy Experience...LOL, but I liked
Lords Of Acid and all the shit too. I dunno who is worse...

Well, as for me, I guess it started with some Depeche Mode, and definitely
Deee-Lite.  I stuck with them ever since 'groove is in the heart' and bought
all 3 of their albums.  I'll always be a big fan of the band members no
matter if Lady Miss Kier can't spin.  I'd rather hear her sing, but oh well.
I was also influenced by my neighbor's brother (Dj Unix).  He had a whole
getup in his room, and i'd hear rapid beats some nights while i was trying
to sleep, or while I was at his house playing snes with his brother.  At
that time I was a big fan of alternative music.  That's back when bands used
to rock, now alt bands completely suck.  I think that's why i made the
switch to techno also.

Remember that old station "Mix Jams"? ( i forget the frequency )
I used to listen to it back in middle school...it played sort of that
technopop kind of stuff alot - the klf, crystal waters, jesus jones.
Anyway, when Metropol first opened they had a commercial on there that had
some *very* ravey (like "James Brown is Dead") music on it.  I was like
"Yeah - this commercial blows away everything on this station!"   That was
the first thing to my recollection.  

I really 'discovered' techno (started trying to listen to it, etc..) when
my aunt gave me this big ole radio when i was in the 8th grade.  It had
all these buttons for different wacky frequency bands, so you could pick
up longwave, shortwave, (a couple other weird ones), as well as AM & FM.
I would just scan the dial looking for cool sounds (even the noise came up
with some spiffy stuff at times)...occasionally i'd hit a tiny band where
i didn't realize there ever was a station before, but if i knocked the
dial slightly off one way or another, it would basically be gone.  98.5FM
wpts, i later found out, was pitt's college radio. (its now 92.1fm in case
you care).  They played almost nothing i'd ever heard before, and NO
commercials except some funny crappy PSA's about the 'dangers of weed'.
Sporadically tuning in to this station, I started listening to the 'techno
show' on tuesday nights 1-3am....the music all seemed amorphous, but
beautiful....to my ears then it sounded nothing like it does today....kind
of a happy thing. :)

Eventually I also discovered wrct (88.3), and listened to shows like
TOYTOWN, underground trax, and the techno-terrorists...You may find this
amazing, but i didn't even own a cd or tape player until i was in 9th
grade....i was a radio and record kid def...Also like Dave Schwanke - i
was heavy into Mods and the like when i was in high school, and
computer/traxx kids really taught me alot about techno, as well as made
some great tunes that were free....

As for why i like techno....its a tough thing to 'explain'.  Its just
appealing...it combines so many influences, yet maintains an internal
structure...loops and counterloops...I think there's different good things
about different types of techno.  I really like the energy and rawness of
hardcore, and that led me into jungle as my primary interests...but really
I enjoy just about all types when i'm in the right mindframe. 

a short, boring story from me,
 doctor cutup....

when i was growing up, we used "techno" as an umbrella term for electronic
dance music.  my early teen years of the late 80's were filled with sounds
we usually call "new wave" or "industrial" these days: omd, joy division,
electronic, yaz, sinead o'connor, thompson twins, culture club ... um
black box ...

and believe it or not, these were the "pop" musicmakers in the korean
american community at the time.  (that changed when we found out they were 
all gay drug addicts.)

then i got into bowie, eno, thrill kill kult, moby ...

and forget about cd's ... i'm talking cassette tapes here ...

does anyone know who did the song "the promise"?  it goes, "i'm sorry but
i'm just thinkin up the right words to say.  i know they don't sound the
way i planned them to be, but if you wait around a while i'll make you
fall for me - i promise you, i will ..."

i didn't know it was disco at the time, but i was really into blondie and
abba and this song that goes, "oooh, i feel lu-uh-uh-uh-love"

my sister had a friend who made a continuous mix tape with the theme sog
from "the neverending story" and anything box and lots of other goodies
... i thot it was neato mosquito

living in oblivion-
me

ps that song "shout" from tears for fears is begging for a trip-hop remix

hmmm.....well i'd have to say my first would be back there with depeche mode
and thrill kill kult,...but with a lot of free and sleepless time on my hand
i'd skim the channels once and a while, i discovered AMP on mtv...and what was
this music?
...well...i moved and met a weird boy who wore baggy pants and had an odd
style of dancing, unlike anything i had ever seen...listened to great bands
(some i knew some i didn't) ....
....wanna go to a rave...hmmm...sure....
.....oh that's what that music was :)   
......it all came together, i was in love...
so here i am....i guess that's how it happened...

	Way to go spreading crap rumors there chief. This is TOTALLY

	This kind of gossip is fucking idiotic.

	Actually, I think what's "whacked" is your inane desire

Wow, well, since you're inside, please tell me why John from House of
Styles was passing out remix-a-matosis flyers at Crush? Did he get a job
from NGL? I saw John and Darren at Crush, they didnt seem to be smoking
any bowls together or laughing and giggling about old times. I'm not
gonna say anymore about this tho cause there's alot of stuff I can't
really say... research it your self or wait a few weeks :)

Herm... I have no desire to tear down NGL... If you've read any of my
posts in the past 2 weeks on this subject, I've been one of the most
supportive of them of any on the list. I try to only post things that I
hear from multiple well informed people, anything I post that's just
opinion, I mark it as IMHO (InMyHumbleOpinion). Anything I hear from
just 1 person I consider private and don't post... As I said in my post,
I really hope they stay around... I want MORE parties in Pittsburgh.

I think I said this was rumor and not fact... did you actually read my
post? You seem really pissed... mebby you should calm down before you
post again, it'll save you from looking like an asshole when the facts
come out :)

OK Josh... way to go...
Ur real kewl in hard core flaming someone.
But perhaps you should have read what he
said first...perhaps you overlooked the statement.
it said "correct me if you know more/better"
NOT "be an ass and use explatives in setting
the story right."
Chill man....I certainly didn't take that as fact...
and I heard many of the same rumors and was
kinda getting the same idea way from what I was
seeing/ hearing Sat. before this was posted.
But that's why we ask questions. isn't it?

Thanks to those who came out for CRUSH on Saturday.  We had a really
great response from everyone. It was definitely our most positive
event to date....no really shady people, no noise complaints, etc. 
Sorry about the heat, though.  We had an industrial a/c but it broke
down.  Next time we'll make sure that doesn't happen.
Please give us some input (good or bad) so we can improve on our
future events.  You can call our info line at 412-734-8443 or e-mail
us at jazzstepper@yahoo.com.
Peace-
Sessions Crew

UHH? HELLO MCFLY? Correct me i *IM* wrong but DK was one of the guys that 
was defending NGL the last time this shit was discussed and gave the last 
crane party a kickass review.  Check your brain before you speak, you might 
learn something.

	The first electronic music i really liked was stuff like pretty hate machine.
I always kinda liked industrial stuff but for years refused to listen to "rave
music".....BUT then i started getting high with "toM" and listening to this
trance cd....and somwhere along the line started liking it.  Soon after that i
went to my first party, and the rest is history.

>>What was the very first techno/anything ravish song you have ever

my first was the prodigy last year
got _mftjg_ then moved on to chem. bros. and other big beat
also moby and stuff
been moving into gettin' mo stuff, starting to appreciate some hip-hop a
bit more and looove jazzy assss deeeeeeeeep jungle
and underworld is a huge fav.
i think the fact i was fed up with alt. music at the time had a lot to do
with it. like i still listen to alt. rock stuff on the radio every now and
then but never buy any, just was looking for a alternative to alternative,
came up with dance music, found that i love to dance and then started to go
to parties

yah!  gotta love that funky beat . . .

That CD was "Jungle Mix".  Yeah it sounds generic as hell, but it is an
entirely old school ragga jungle cd from back in the day that has
"Original Nuttah'" "RIP" and some other good tunes as well.

Its all about Original Nuttah for me personaly.  I heard that song and
new instantly that this was some seriously good shit.

	Actually, if you took your own advice, you'd save yourself a

	people who get a lot of crap from those that don't get it.

	Over and out.

Although my roots were in Gary Numan, Depeche Mode Remixes, Info Soc and
the others of that era, i give credit for some nameless DJ(s) on WRCT for
getting me into what we call Rave. The rave-till-dawn compliation and the
sesame street remix come to mind. They annonced the Gate-O-Rave party on
theone show i heard.  I had no real idea what it would be just thinking eh
another under-21 night-o-dancing.  I knew something was really wierd when
we had to walk through the back door and all these candles were set up in
the back alley lighting the way.  What ensued for the next 7 hours or so
blew my mind. An alcoholess event of people dancing, jumping any way they
liked to some really kicking-non-stop music!  The rest is history, i was
hooked.

I remember the very first time I got to go to a Rave, it was in the
Hill District, right above the Rainbow Kitchen, in the Laundry part of 
it.  Room was so dark you couldn't see nothin', and only 1 strobe light 
was there, and some porno videos were on, but the music was great!

They would sorta go back and forth from playing Techno to Rap, but after 
that first time I just wanted more!  

Unfortunately, the people who threw those parties quit doing it, but 
that was okay, since Turbozen moved into the Oakland area, and Deadly 
Buda threw the best parties that I will always remember!

Crush sorta reminded me of the old days, a lot of tunes I remember so 
well!  It had sort of that feeling where you just showed up and danced 
the whole night through!  

peace!

Parents suk!
I had a couple once that I used to have to lie to all the time
Bowling, Playing pool, concerts and "staying over at Linseys" quickly
became popular excuses.  Eventually tho I moved out and decided to be
straight with my mom about raves, boys, drugs etc. because she wasn't
supporting me and couldn't get me into trouble.  I actually thought it
would make our relationship beter but I wouldn't suggest it now, a year
later she is still the same, hates hearing about raves, still thinks
they are drug parties (tho I am more likely sober at a party than on any
random night) and constantly worries.  I guess that unless your parents
have "been there" they won't understand and what they don't know won't
hurt them.  Holding back some truths and telling them that you are a
good kid (assuming it is true) should help a little uh, maybe.
Good Luck! (rave on) lov, -N-

Thing is, a lot of changes have taken place since last week, I mean 
tremendous changes.  John told Kelly he was going to talk to Darren, who 
feels this is something he cannot just do part time.  Planning a party 
takes 24-7 and he just couldn't do it day after day.

Looks to me everything fell into Johns' favor, and if it has Great!
I can go to Rabbit in the Moon guilt free!  I am glad me and Kelly made 
up, I gave her a flashlight and another for Richard.  Seems the 
warehouse is sorta not in the picture, at least that space, but who 
knows?  Might be another one soon.

And yeah, all through Crush I was real happy for John, glad to see 
everyone getting along, and the vibe was good.

By the way, Pat is opening a record store soon in Mt. Washington, gotta 
go see that!

Peace out in the 'hood!

Please make sure *someone* responsible knows where you are though. It
would suck to have an accident or something and your parents would never
know where to look for you.

...as long as we're talking about boy george...

when i was in germany last summer, i was watching some weird-as-fuck
german tv show that was like a HUGE concert in some giant soccer arena
that lasted 1 hour, with all of the bands with hits in europe coming
on to play thier one hit song, hosted by these wacky german people
doing wacky german people stuff (i think it is a weekly thing.
anyways, boy george performed, and he had like 8 chins and he was ALL
fat. his song was REALLY weak and it was accompanied by these
tryin-to-be-artsy dancers that were pretty much having sex on stage.

that show is how i knew all about the backstreet boys before they made
it to america. i asked the girl i was stayin with what she listens to,
and she said "boygroup music" meaning shit like that. there are more
boygroups in europe than you could possibly imagine. its kinda scary
actually.

the end

up until I was 13, all my music came from my older brother, who had somehow
gotten  into underground stuff when he was in elementary school.  I loved
(and still regularly play) Love God by the Soup Dragons, the one album
between their crappy glam-metal phase and their crappy pop phase.  Even
though they did sampling and weird beats, the first real techno I heard was
about 3 years ago, when my cousin came home from germany.  She played some
track for me with an alarm clock in it (ring a bell, anyone? =), and I
thought it was pretty nifty that you could make music with things other than
guitars and drums.  A few more years, I was still interested in the music,
and then I saw the video for "Around the World" by Daft Punk.  If you
haven't, ask somebody who has.  I basically thought, "so ravers have these
weird little creatures dancing around in their brains, too...hmm..." and
thus I was sucked to the dark side =)

In a message dated 98-06-03 23:03:20 EDT, you write:

<< if you are going to crush this weekend, dress to sweat.
 
 cotton is good, but sweat doesnt evaporate off it.
 
 i prefer soccer jersey material (lycra, polyester, whatever that stuff it) 
 
 i mean the newer stuff wicks moisture off your skin so u stay cool+dry and
 it evaporates quickly so your clothes dont get soaked. >>

uhm, i recommend HEFTY garbage bags cuz they give you so much
freedom of movement...and it's water-proof, so the sweat has a tendency to 
bead right off and hit a non-suspecting fellow rave dancer right in the eye...
(this happened to me once and i was so impressed with the movement of a
half blinded raver batting his eye that i bit his style and called it
"liquid") and 
when you put 'em on right, you look just like a California Raisin, so it must 
be stylish...

(my mom used to dress me in these clothes that were 10 sizes too big, 
 hoping i would grow into 'em, i didn't know all these other kids would bite 
 my stylee ;P~ )

In a message dated 98-06-04 01:09:41 EDT, you write:

<< the sessions crew has worked very hard to make it clear that ignorance and
 disrespect of the sort you mentioned above (shooting up, smoking crack)
 WILL NOT IN ANY WAY BE TOLERATED.
 
 there is one reason sessions throws parties. to present quality music in an
 intimate space and build a tight vibe.  anyone who does anything in
 contradiction to this goal is dealt with harshly (those of you who went to
 their last party in december know what i am talking about). >>

uhm, when i confronted my now ex-girlfriend @ TRIBE on why she came to the
party if not for the music or to dance, she shoved me to the floor...i think
it was
then that it dawned on me that altho my new girlie wuz well enlightened in her
sexual prowess, she hadn't the slightest inkling as to what the scene was 
truley about...i apologized to walt for bringing such uniformed individuals
and
proceeded to escort layla & her friends to the door...

...sad thing is, this is a true story ;(

This dorky kid had his brothers copy of Lords of Acid - Lust and 
played it for me, I loved it! I stole it from him and went on to buy 
the infamous rave till dawn..this was when I was about 13..I started 
listening to this local radio show that played alot of cool 
stuff..god within, freaky chakra, fuse, lots an lots of other 
stuff...then, I saw this episode of beverly hills 90210 where they 
had to go to a gass station and "exchange an egg" in return for 
directions to an underground warehouse party, and I was like totaly 
mesmerized, it was so mystical and interesting! :)  Then I found this 
local access cable show about the local party scene, and then a 
friend and I finally went to a party, and I've been hooked ever since 
;)

Natalie was going to bring the fliers but at the last minute wasn't
able to come.  It's a shame but couldn't be helped.

WORD!  I haven't talked to anyone else, but I think it's pretty safe to
say that the RSP will be in full effect.  For those who don't know 'bout
the RSP, get youselves to the information center!  Nah, just kidding, but
we will be there.

I'm not sure exactly what the first techno I heard was, but among the
first techno I ever heard was the CD Jungle Mix, a tape made by an old
friend of my sister's Steve Bruder who some of you probably know, the
Orb, and most definitely Tricky.  I spent many nights zoniing to the
hypnotic sounds of Tricky in my friends basement.

But my like of techno music did not come to an apex untill I went to my
first rave.  This was on May 25th of 1996 . . . damn, 1996 seems so
close, but it seems like so long since that night.  Well anyways . . .
here is something I wrote a couple of months ago for school about this
fateful night:

	One of the most influential moments of my life was the first time
I went to a rave.  A rave is a party where many people go and dance the
entire night.  The music that moves these huge numbers of people is
techno, computer generated music, created specificaly for dancing.  While
the huge speakers blast the music is blended by the DJ, different colored
lights shoot across the venue, moving to the beat.  As I arrived at the
event I had no idea what I was getting into.  The only thing I new was
that techno would be played, which I wasn't very into at the time.  For
the first few hours most of the people were sitting down and only a few
brave souls were on the empty dancefloor dancing like I had never seen
before.  As it neared midnight, more people arrived and eventually enough
people were dancing that I dared to test my untried dancing skills out. 
For the first few minutes I awkwardly swayed, and attempted to get into
the groove while observing other people.  In a short period of time I
realized that nobody was looking at me and I was free to do whatever I
wanted.  At this point I lost all inhibitions and dove into the
experience without looking back.  As my body moved to the pulsating
rhythm spewed forth from the speakers, I gained something that I had
never even came close to realizing before.  I became one with myself and
at the same time one with the person standing next to me, and one with
the entire dancefloor, and one with the city, and one with the entire
universe.  My mind went blank and my mind was full.  I forgot everything
I'd ever learned and at the same time remembered.  I left my worries
behind while keeping all responsibilities in check.  As the beat pounded
I slide across the dance floor like an ice skater on ise.  I didn't stop,
I couldn't stop.  The only thing that mattered was the unrelenting rhythm
sent through my body by the massive tower of speakers and the searing
beams of light that cut the air like a saber through water.  These were
the only things important.  All else faded into the background.  And then
I had to leave.  What seemed like half an hour had in reality been three
or four.  I achieved a new pinnacle of self-knowledge that night, and
ever since I have never been the same.

And that's my take on it.

ABSOLUT

Ferreal, RSP, watch out or we'll be on you Advanced Dungeons & Dragons

Guess what - you are!  PBS is sooo hardcore that we even start fights
with ourselves, with kids biting their own hands, pulling their own hair,
peeing on themselves, etc.... ;)

PS:  This is just good natured jibing and in no way reflects the true
situation between RSP and PBS. :)   I never even heard of RSP before
today, and PBS isn't even a "krew", its just the moniker we're using to
promote some good music + fun events.  :)

sigh, the pb room will not go as planned, i've had one person back out from
the 2nd room and 2 more say they're performing much shorter sets than
originally planned.
so heres what i've decided, anyone who originally planned coming can still
come up and we'll do the best we can in the 2nd room with everyone.

the ppl i have talked to about coming up are:
frankie & todd
(mskw1?)
tom coxx
bryce lynch
andy

any others?

let me know if you are still interested in headed out so i can get a
schedule set up.....   

tnx,!!!  trouty.

Hey, don't forget me!  I figured you hadn't but who knows.
Apparently Trevor is getting a ride from Tom, (aka not driving me) and so
I'm not sure how I'm getting there unless someone backs out of Tom's car.
Most likely I'll find some way.  I'll let you know if I won't be there
though.

I thought Hanson were girls!?

Hmmm oh well!
This will be one of my last posts for a while as summer is here and I
don't have a computer to use!  It has been fun talking to everyone and
meeting some of you hope to cu at family affair!

My first time was New Years last year and I didn't even dance I just
walked around, talked to people, and had the time of my life - the music
and lights amazed me and the fact that I was tripping for the first time
didn't help : )
Before that time "techno" was something from the 80's to me and I hadn't
really paid much attention to it but I was hooked and that my next party
danced the night away!

                                          to care and love
regardless..."-david

if somebody can loan me the following items (that are kinda stuck where
they are for another month or so, meaning NO MOVING WHATSOEVER *sigh*) i
could do a quick lameass set. :)

Roland TB-303 and TR-909 *OR* an MC303 and an MC505
A Roland EP-9 *WITHOUT* soundbrush
A Quasimidi Raven
One (count it, ONE) BASIC turntable (meaning something you don't spin on)
and a stereo CD player..

I could possibly throw something together, and I don't mind doing longass
sets. :)

This is both a survey and a question out to you kids:

A friend of mine is planning to start up 'mainstream techno'
(electronica?) slash industrial night @ the Pollenator (the 2nd floor of
the beehive) on tuesday nights.  His concept it to appeal to the crowd new
to techno as well as an older crowd that might be tired of 'raves', but
still enjoys the music.  Consequently, he's interested in finding dj(s)
that are well versed in the more mainstream techno acts (he mentioned chem
bros, prodigy, propellorheads, accucrack, roni size to me). 

 Anyone out there think they fit that description, or know someone who
does? I'm pretty sure there's no requirement of beatmatching (although it
can't hurt) - merely playing cd's back to back with some kind of flow.

Also, I'm wondering what people think of this overall?  Would you go?  
Since its a bar, it would be 21+, which i think is one limit.  However, i
think it has a certain advantage of being the 'beehive', a pretty central
place that folks (especailly college kids) during the year will check out.

I think this would be really nice.  As an older person who is a little
tired, but not out of it completely, I would like to see this happen.  And
Geoff, you know I would be there.  What would it cost?

Since you asked...
Good luck. :)
I dont like the idea because we already have metropol's mainstream drunken 
techno night.  Laga has the 18plus jungle.  Personally, I think he might 
make a killing if you could pull off an all ages with a slighly higher then 
normal entry prices.  Pitsburgh really needs a regular all ages techno 
night.  However, for this to work you would need to find a way to make 
money besides alcohol and thats not the way things work in pgh :) Though 
the all ages may not be possible since i dont know the setup so it may 
simply not be possible to mix 21 and non 21ers.

However, it might work.  Not everyone is a jungle fan (raises his hand and 
waits for the grassy knoll to take aim). If he alternated oposite weeks for 
scj then that would be better imho then doing it every week or doing it 
with scj.  Considering scj is going to have the 18 to 21's (and their 
friends that are 21) and those that are indifferent to techno vs jungle 
would prolly end up at laga since atleast the dance floor is non alcoholic. 
 (Whereas, if they are going to drink and listen they would end up at the 
beehive. ) Just some stuff to consider.  Keep in mind that the beehive isnt 
that many steps away from laga.

Just some ideas.

Id prolly check it out cuz I like mainstream techno for the reason that I 
know the songs and dance better to songs I know.  But I doubt i would go 
very often since i tend to not like the bar atmosphere mixed with techno. 
(Used to piss me off when the drunks or boisterous would shout shit at the 
dj from behind the bar at scj, which is why is stopped going, heard too 
many "damn druggy kids" comments)

This is both a survey and a question out to you kids:

A friend of mine is planning to start up 'mainstream techno'
(electronica?) slash industrial night @ the Pollenator (the 2nd floor of
the beehive) on tuesday nights.  His concept it to appeal to the crowd new
to techno as well as an older crowd that might be tired of 'raves', but
still enjoys the music.  Consequently, he's interested in finding dj(s)
that are well versed in the more mainstream techno acts (he mentioned chem
bros, prodigy, propellorheads, accucrack, roni size to me).

 Anyone out there think they fit that description, or know someone who
does? I'm pretty sure there's no requirement of beatmatching (although it
can't hurt) - merely playing cd's back to back with some kind of flow.

Also, I'm wondering what people think of this overall?  Would you go?
Since its a bar, it would be 21+, which i think is one limit.  However, i
think it has a certain advantage of being the 'beehive', a pretty central
place that folks (especailly college kids) during the year will check out.

not everyone is...but it is a well-known fact that jungle is the supreme

Hehe. Yah, except for the fact that friday night techno at laga used to 
woop major ass.  Except that of course during the summer attandence dropped 
and laga was too stupid to bring it back.
Ill prolly try jungle again sometime at laga since my tastes are constantly 
changing.  Like the weather in pittsburgh, I dont like my tastes, I wait 15 
minutes.

You've got to use the word 'support' loosely when the dancefloor is
barely filled for Special K and Skibadee.    There's actually a couple
21+ house, techno and club nights....although yep, SCJ is the only 'genre'
18+ night....and we're damn lucky to still have it given the attendance.

A good all-ages various techno styles club night would be great IMHO....i
think the last try was the first two weeks of chameleon....but it didn't
have a good location for the kids to get to.

Personally I agree with Schwanke in that i don't like the bar-fueled
clubscene of pgh....of course that was one of the main things of the 'rave
scene' in the first place.  Still, if you can get a 'club' venue ti
throw 'raves' in like 168, in pittsburgh that's often the best you can do
without investing alot more money.  Or you can just do houseparties.
Or renedages.  

I'm babbeling.

Just to remind,

DJ Smoov and DJ Ruffian are doing their stuff at Zythos tonight starting
at 10pm... I think cover is $2 or $3... I saw Smoov spin there about a
month ago and he was the bomb... Definatly worth checking out... It's
21+ by the way... Zythos is in 2100 block of Carson street.

Dan K

See you all at Commencement, Nocturnal Emission, and Spike's
Graduation... Also, if you're gonna be in Pittsburgh, and free on
Tuesday, it's my birthday and I plan to do major damage to my cranium...
Possibly live DJs, not sure yet... if you're interested in coming, call
me (412-519-3845) Should start about 2am or so in the Vicinity of Carson
street...

( If you're emailing me in the next week expect lengthy delays cause I'm
moving... anything important dont post but email cause there's just too
much for me to go through on the list when I'm so busy )

That is probably a good idea, but I doubt that's what all the older
ravers like.  Some of that is what the newer people like, and therefore
probably not good for playing to old school heads.  I would think that
mellow house would be the best.  Something a little jazzy maybe, some
atmospheric jungle . .. .I don't really know though, I'm just imagining.

>can't hurt) - merely playing cd's back to back with some kind of flow.

That wouldn't be too hard . . . I would say I'd see if I could do it, but
I'm not old enough to even walk in there :)

anyone out there with 1200's wanna tell me what a good setting for the
tone-arm height and weight should be?

right now i have the height on my tables at 2.5, the weight reversed and
maxed, and the anti-skate at 3.

my cartridges are 500AL's...

i just want to compare with what other people have...i'm paranoid i'm
putting too much weight on the records...

thanks,

jeff

well, i have my tables settings in varying positions, cuz ive found that 
it doesnt make a bit of difference, mainly because i think theyre set up 
incorrectly....although i do have the little weights behind the weight 
removed so it puts more pressure on the vinyl.....i dont think you have 
too much to worry about unless your cartridge is tilted for scratching 
or other random do-it-yourself adjustments...

Yeah, I'd be on that list as well.

In fact, I just got my presale tickets Wednesday.  They came pretty fast
to...I just mailed them the money Monday.

On the tickets it says:
    Riverside Music Park
    Coolsville, OH

Does anyone know where the dillyo that is?

   Jul 10-12 TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL Texas [major far away, but really
   looks fun!!!! WOo-HA! lots of camping for me this summer!!!] As you
   may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
   Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
   Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this
   great cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00
   camping/maintenance fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On
   average the talent we are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of
   them are unsigned and some of them are simply putting out their own
   records. It is truly a special treat to see them all in one location.
   This is a great "convention" if you will; of the best Texas has to
   offer. This year all talent and volunteers will pay nothing and be
   provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and drinks. This year we
   are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a nominal $15.00 for
   the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any profit made on
   this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us in the
   morning! Bring a can good if you can. Anyway,...back to the
   convention. The convention of sorts is called the "Texas Electronica
   Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas Electronica
   Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
   Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
   ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
   porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
   showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and
   lots of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July
   10th. Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required
   to cover maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates
   will close at Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates
   will be locked for your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will
   re-open at 9 am Sun July 12th. We will have everything you need during
   this timeframe, EMS as well. Only under extreme circumstances would
   you be allowed to pass through our 2 gates to the outside world
   between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This is a campout, please
   come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks, tents, beach balls,
   kites...whatever. QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said
   "So if you want a touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a
   huge dollop of raveyness, then this is the place to be. Just don't
   forget to pack the toilet paper along with the tent. After all this is
   the great outdoors!" The listings!!! These are in no order! send mail

	Hey alls :) Okie, family affair is on July 3rd 4th and 5th right?
With my work schedule I can get days off the 3rd and 4th OR the 4th and
5th.  My question is (for those who have attended family affair in the
past) which would be better? Going the 3rd and 4th and getting to see it
beginning but having to leave during the middle, or the 4th and
5th...arriving during the middle and staying till the end?  Let me know
eh? :)

ok, you are in a tuff situation my friend.  Haveing gone to FA for the past 3
years, here is what i can tell you.  Friday night is always fun because that
is when you see alot of old friends, you set up your camp, you spend a lot of
time trying to get used to exactly what it is that you are in for.  But
Saturday night is THE VIBE!!!  I guess if i had to miss one night it would be
friday, because once you get their, you will not want to leave, especially in
the middle of the event.

Woah. Like. Ok.  Im sitting here reading this mail when all of a sudden my 
dream (from about 10 minutes ago :) pops into my head.  Aparently I was 
dreaming about all of us!  Hehe, I know there were about 10 or 15 of us who 
were carpooling from rave to rave across the country.  I remember knowing 
Jennifer, Amanda, Casey, Dan, and Trout explicitly and had that general 
dream "I know you but I cant name you" feeling for most of the other faces 
that I've met at the netmeets.  The only other thing that sticks out in 
memory is that everyone was driving 6 seater BLACK cars with RED leather 
except dan who was driving a RED car with BLACK leather.  I think dan's car 
only had the two seats but i cant quite remember. That was wierd.

Just to remind,

DJ Smoov and DJ Ruffian are doing their stuff at Zythos tonight starting
at 10pm... I think cover is $2 or $3... I saw Smoov spin there about a
month ago and he was the bomb... Definatly worth checking out... It's
21+ by the way... Zythos is in 2100 block of Carson street.

Dan K

See you all at Commencement, Nocturnal Emission, and Spike's
Graduation... Also, if you're gonna be in Pittsburgh, and free on
Tuesday, it's my birthday and I plan to do major damage to my cranium...
Possibly live DJs, not sure yet... if you're interested in coming, call
me (412-519-3845) Should start about 2am or so in the Vicinity of Carson
street...

( If you're emailing me in the next week expect lengthy delays cause I'm
moving... anything important dont post but email cause there's just too
much for me to go through on the list when I'm so busy )

You might want to consider the fact that FA usually ends about 12:00 noon
on the last day which is the 5th.  Just wanted to let you know.

Hello All...
     I thought everyone deserved to finally find out exactly what 's been
going on with the Rabbit in the Moon party.  First off, it is canceled.
Secondly, Downlow is no longer affiliated with NGL.  Our attempts to help
them proved to be more useless effort on our part and little results as a
whole.  We don't regret being involved with them.  We simply understand now
that it was impossible from the start for them to understand how the scene
works and how things have evolved with many people working together.
     NGL saw Digital Genesis to be a complete disaster.  We know that many
people there had the time of their lives and that given the time constraints
the turnout was satisfactory.  As NGL's only source of promotional support,
Downlow has been held responsible for the fact that NGL lost money on that
event.  In an effort to make the money up for them and bring another great
event to the city, we've been working every day to get the word out about
Remixamatosis with RITM.  Unfortunately NGL hadn't even a signed contract
with RITM or the other DJs on the Remix. line-up.  In other words, we were
promoting for an event that was in the early stages of planning (two weeks
before the party date).  This could never work. We learned that no flights
had been paid for and that negotiations were still in the works between NGL
and RITM.
     We're sorry above all that a Pittsburgh event has been promoted and
will not come to be.  Hopefully this can be avoided in the future with
better planning and communication among the promoters in Pittsburgh.

Sincerely
Kelly & Rich @ Downlow

Subject: {pb-cle} why kraftwerk is important

a brief attempt to capture some of the mythology of kraftwerk and transmit
it to you.  everyone talks about why krafwerk means so much, but what do
we really know?

KRAFTWERK emerged from germany's psychedelic/space/krautrock scene in the
late 1960s, a scene whose music was free from precedent and heavily
influenced by LSD as well as the compositional freedoms offered by minimal
music (classical, avant-garde, and so on); music that took the basic
formulas and extended, repeated, and subdued them in various ways.  ralf
hutter and florian schneider, the core members of kraftwerk, met in the
conservatory in dusseldorf, germany, and their first musical outing was
the krautrock-influenced ORGANISATION, a 4-member band exploring free-form
experimental music.  

after some personnel changes which saw the arrival of percussionists karl
bartos and wolfgang flur, KRAFTWERK emerged in the early '70s. the first
several releases by the band were in a droning, krautrock vein.  by 1974,
they had begun turning toward a more technologically-oriented music, and
their paeon to auto travel, the album _autobahn_, became their first
bona-fide classic.  an edited segment of the epic, repetitive, chanting
title track was an international hit, even making the top ten in the US.
with their 1975 concept album _radioactivity_ (celebrating the ascendancy
of the radio, as well as some sinister affinities with the nuclear age),
and their essential 1977 'euro' album _trans-europe express_, their
transformation into a technopop band was complete.  with _trans-europe_,
their technological affectations became more clear, with the eerie strings
of the title track (which of course went on to inspire "planet rock" by
AFRIKA BAMBAATAA, and "clear" by cybotron), while also showing their first
signs of plasticity in the disturbing, dr. who-like "showroom dummies,"
and the downright scary "hall of mirrors," complemented by the smooth,
peaceful textures of "europe endless" and "schubert."

at this point, kraftwerk's philosophy became more apparent.  their
intention was to create a universal music.  since the german culture had
virtually come to a standstill after world war II (for reasons which are
obvious but still need to be remembered), for a band to be singing in
german was quite a revelation, and unprecedented.  moreover, they released
albums in other languages including english, french and even japanese. 
and with each record, they seemed to progressively lose their connection
with humanity...

they reached their artistic peak in 1978 with the trancey album _man
machine_, whose essential tracks include "the robots," "the model," "neon
lights," and "spacelab."  with this record, they captured the essence of
technopop, and in fact defined it for a generation of artists and
listeners.  their seamless combination of humanity and technology was
immensely influential, even though they were seen as cold and inhuman. 
but in retrospect, they were simply pointing the way towards what would
be...technology working together with humans to make a new music, with all
the wonders as well as the worries inherent to the process.

a few years of silence while the world caught up.  by the late '70s, the
impact of kraftwerk was clear, thanks to the rise of technopop and new
wave.  japan's YELLOW MAGIC ORCHESTRA, england's GARY NEWMAN and DAVID
BOWIE, germany's DAF and EINSTUERZENDE NEUBAUTEN, american bands like
DEVO, and of course the creators of electro were just a handful among the
artists that they directly influenced.  after upgrading their kling klang
studio, they unleashed their finest moment, _computer world_, in 1981.  a
few critics have clamored about how out-of-touch the album is with the
rest of music at that time, and it's true that even in 1981, pop music had
already passed them by...but nonetheless _computer world_ is still their
most important and most influential record.  the stop-start syncopation of
"numbers" provided electro with its beat, while "it's more fun to compute" 
and "home computer" set the sinister tone of things to come: computers
integrated into our everyday lives.  but there was a lighter side, with
the willfully-nerdy "pocket calculator" to balance the equation.  with
this album, they also took the final, logical, irrevocable step of
replacing themselves with lifelike dummies in their likeness.  during
their impressive 1981 tour, they performed on small calculator-like remote
controls, and for the encore, only the dummies returned to "perform" while
the real members controlled the music offstage.

the melancholy song "tour de france" was their officially-sponsored
contribution to the tour de france bicycle race in 1983, and also became a
breakdance epic.  soon after, work began on their next album, _electric
cafe_.  after working on it for several years, they abandoned many of the
ideas and the final product was compiled and released by francois
kevorkian in 1986. in some ways it is their weakest effort, but still
retained a lot of their original preoccupations, and contains vintage
kraftwerkianisms such as "techno pop," the hilarious "sex object," and the
title track. 

since 1986, kraftwerk has not released a single new composition.  a remix
album called _the mix_ was released in 1991, and their subsequent tour saw
the departure of bartos and flur, who were replaced by two new members.
the remixes were digitally-reorganized versions of their greatest hits,
and a relatively weak effort that seemed extremely out of touch
considering the rise of the house and techno cultures which were largely
based on their music and ideas.

nevertheless, kraftwerk's legendary status has done nothing but grown
since the last breach of their self-imposed silence.  in 1997, they were
miraculously coaxed out to play live at the tribal gathering, with hutter
and schneider at the helm (along with two new members), and an eleborate
costume/stage presentation that left the crowd in awe despite the lack of
new musical material.

now, they take their music to the world one more time.  rumors of new
music have been circulating for years, but the only thing announced so far
is a possible live compilation album.  yet a live performance is more than
enough from these living legends.  and, with an appreciation of
kraftwerk's 25-year history, it's easy to imagine that their lack of new
music is a deliberate choice; yet another interrogation and commentary of
our technological culture.  or perhaps they have not written any new music
because new music is not necessary...perhaps no one really understood it
in the first place? 

to paraphrase another writer, it is impossible to tell whether they are
parodying themselves in their all-encompassing embrace of technology, or
if they are parodying us... 

either way, it is a testament to their musical influence to imagine the
wild diversity of people that will attend the latest return of kraftwerk.
new age hippies, krautrockers, punks, new wavers, goths, electro headz,
hip-hop headz, industrial headz, and everyone from the many dance cultures
that have sprouted since (including our little corner here in the
midwest)...all united under one roof, to witness the revival of one of
their most important bands. 

perhaps they did create a universal music after all...?

Sigh :(

Any chance they will come to PGH this summer under a different party
name?


Also, Any word on the space for Intergalactic Circus?

I was checking out In-Pittsburgh yesterday and noticed that right smack
in the middle is a 2-page add, one is like metropol clubs, the other is
"THE CRANE"... being rented for whatever... seemed weird to advertise a
space for rent in a full-page add.. but whatever...

Say, while we're on the subject of Kraftwerk... I picked up this CD by a
group called KraftWelt at NRM... and I have to say that they are my gods
now... It is so awesome... I would recommend it to anyone into
electronic music... I think it's prolly the best CD I've ever listened
to, the dynamic range is way up there, samples are super-pure-clean, it
has the craziest fucking beats I've ever heard on it, and even the
couple of mellow songs on it are awesome... Recommend listening to it
really loud (do to the large dynamic range) with a flat equalization
(Normally I got the bass turned way up, but this sounds awesome if you
flatten it out) I guess headphones would be cool as hell too... I dunno,
just get this CD, if you dont like it I'll be flabbergasted. :)

Btw, The Instigator and Ed Umm were telling me it's like a super-band
with members of Kraftwerk involved in it... no wonder it kicks so much
ass... It's the only CD ever to eclipse "Electronic Cabaret" by
Kraftwerk in my opinion.

I dont think its about taking SCJ down. Im just saying that when I go to
SCJ I have a good time, but that  I must admit I feel a little outta
place. I would still go, but it would be nice to go to a place where I fit
in...where I dont feel so old.  Whoa, that sounded dumb...but some of you
know what I mean.  

I think it would be good for people to have options and this is an option.
As long as its on a different night, it shouldnt matter.  What about
friday night?? What happens on fridays?

yo yo kids,
I'm out in seattle for the summer (moving into a nice apt. this sunday) 
so if anyone wants to come out to seattle and crash on my floor for a 
while, you are more than welcome. seattle is weak on the jungle (oh, 
people play it, but I wouldn't say that they can _spin_ it) but has some 
of the tastiest house and trance. (plus a bunch of outdoor parties)
so if you're interested, just email me (I also have some resources on 
getting cheap flights)
plur
Erica
(oh yeah, this is my email for the summer... I'm still checking my other 
one occasionally though)

hi, my name is Bhima (pronounced "beema") born and raised here in the
Wheeling area on a the local Hare Krsna communinty. I'm new to the pb-cle
rave scene . The only pb-cle raves I've been to are "sub-phunc" and "crush"
the both were cool parties. I don't  get on the computer too often, but I
skim through all the messages every few days. It seems like there is quite
a bit fighting going on. I give a name to thank for sub-phunc's chair beats
when the power went out and the clapping at "crush", his name is Govinda he
and his brother "Vasudeva are good musicians. They are mixing some pretty
cool beats on their ASR-10 right now. My friends and I try to get to a rave
at least once a month. Chris Bryant and I usually get it to gather thanks
to the list's help.

I am definitely going to Family Affair 4 and would to be signed up. I will
be going with a group of my friends. I not sure how many because a good bit
of my friends are going to the Rainbow Festival in Arizona. I think I would
like to be on the list although I'm not sure exactly what that means, but
every one else seems to. 

I've only met a few people on the list and so far they have all been
extremely nice and I am looking forward to meting more of you.

bhima

well, it *does* matter (according to the pamphlet distributed by stanton at
several major record shoppes that also sell hardware such as needles &
carts.)

set the height (the big ring around the bottom of the whole tonearm
assembly) so that the very bottom of the needle is about parallell with the
surface of a record on the deck and the needle is vertical in the groove.
then set the weight (not reversed) so that the tonearm floats perfectly
level over the deck (needle not touching the record) then adjust the black
ring on the weight (without adjusting the weight) to zero.  then add from
1-3 grams (set to 1-3) depending on what types of cartridges/headshells you
have.  then get that one record you bought and felt ripped off because the
flipside was just slick vynil with no grooves and put it on the deck and put
the needle down in the approximate middle of the playing area.  adjust the
anti-skate until the needle just rides there and doesn't fall into the
center or out to the edge.  at this point you have your arm set up
approximately correctly for listening to records.

"but i'm not a record listener!" you may be saying, "i'm a deejay!"  okay,
okay, let's make some adjustments so that you can work best.

if you do any backcuing or scratching, max the anti-skate.  remove that
~1cm. weight from the very far end of the tonearm (if you bought your decks
used it's likely gone already, if you got 'em new it unscrews) and put it in
the box with the rubber not-so-slip-mats.  now eek the weight up about 1-2
grams and keep a dime around in case you get crazy sometimes.  as a rule you
don't want to put that extra weight on your vynil unless you really need it.
i've got a small lightweight item that is large enough that i can set it on
the headshell while scratching or backcuing a troublesome record and then
remove it after the track is playing (ever so carefully to not disturb the
song) so that the weight is only on the record for the essential part.

setting your decks like this will require you to be a little bit more
patient and careful, but it'll make your tracks last and sound better a lot
longer.

hmm, i figured i'd chill to that fun ol' real audio site
((http://www.wnyu.org/bpm)) that has been so nicely advertised to us net
geeks, but it just doesn't seem to work....i can connect but it constantly
pauses due to net congestion ...then eventually it stopped all together a few
moments ago (about 11pm).

...i was wondering if anyone else has been able to successfully listen to this
or if my computer is just wacked?  ...and i know next to nothing about
computers so...*help*   =^)~

welp, thats all

cable company at heart.

anyhow, i dont know who all is coming from the list with intentions of
spinning, i have tiko, cutup, circutry x, absolut, mskw1, and tom.  i
havent gotten emails that i know of from anyone else?  i have set a

have left anyone off that list, email TROUT@HYPERREAL.ORG as i seem to be
able to pop3 my mail from there ok and we can see whats up, but the lineup
is pretty full right now, but email to see .......

I'm just wondering where everyone is heading off to this Saturday -- I 
was saving my money and energy for Remixamatosis, but seeing as that 
went bye-bye ... Realm of the Shogun looks great, but *usually* Dayton 
is a bit out of my 100 mile party radius.  Should I just stay in 
Cleveland for Nocturnal Emission (god, that name kills me!), or would it 
be really, really worth my time to head down to Dayton?  I guess I'm 
mostly wondering where all of you guys are going.

OK, we've got who is affiliated with who established now . . . . but some
other questions?  Namely:

Is the crane space still going to be rented out for raves?

Is Intergalactic Circus, more specifically, still going to be held at the
Crane?

Is NGL still involved in the pgh rave scene, and if so do they have any
events in the works?

and the most important question for me:

More specifically are they still planning on throwing the all jungle
party bringing in Shy FX, SS and Warren G? (please say yes, please say
yes, please say yes)

Tryin to get some shit cleared up,
ABSOLUT

guess it will depend on the space.

Wheeling?!? get out of there as fast as possible! It's bad news. I

Okay -- Nocturnal Emission is advertising 8 dj's.  And it's 25 bucks.  
Now I don't know what the price for R. of the S. is (with twice the 
number of dj's, not to mention major headliners), but I will bet it's 
around 25 as well.  What's the deal?  Is there any such thing as a party 
for under 20 bucks in Cleveland anymore?  Just wondering.

Amanda

Kinda odd that the first reply wasn't about the Hare Krsnas (is that a
mispelling?)
Well, I couldn't resist, so on behalf of myself and a bunch of my clueless
friends...
(1) We see you dancing in groups in your funky costumes.  Do you get
changed, and meet up somewhere, or do you put on the costumes in some sort
of custom?
(2) When you're done dancing, do you sorta slow to a stop or is it a sudden
thing?
(3) Do you dance the same way at raves?  I think that would rule.
(4) How do you learn the drumming/dancing/singing combo?  Is there a Hare
Krsna camp somewhere?
(5) Do you rehearse or improvise or what?
(6) Do you go to regular barbers and ask for a Hare Krsna cut or is that a
custom/ritual type thing to be done by another Hare Krsna?
(7) What do you do if, say, somebody trips over his robe-thing, or if the
drummer misses a beat?

Well, that's all I can think of right now.  I find the State College Hare
Krsnas interesting, but every time I've seen them, I've been otherwise
occupied and couldn't follow them.

                                                        peace

yeah, does anyone know about the space for Nocturnal Emission?

>Kinda odd that the first reply wasn't about the Hare Krsnas (is that a
>mispelling?)

There are two ways to spell it "Hare Krsna" and "Hare Krishna."

Az is right about the area but the entire country is flooded with reds and
billies who don't appreciate awesome beats, and our crew down here does a
good job keeping above all the bullshit that goes on with the local trash.
 
>Well, I couldn't resist, so on behalf of myself and a bunch of my clueless
>friends...
>(1) We see you dancing in groups in your funky costumes.  Do you get
>changed, and meet up somewhere, or do you put on the costumes in some sort
>of custom?

Actually the clothing wore by Krsna's is from India and that style has been
worn for over the past 5 thousand years. The hard-cores wear their Krsna
clothes 99% of the time. We aren't hard cores though.

>(2) When you're done dancing, do you sorta slow to a stop or is it a sudden
>thing?

 What knowledge are you trying to gain with this question? I don't
understand, but any ways usually it's a sudden thing

>(3) Do you dance the same way at raves?  I think that would rule.

They just jump around. I have never seen anyone dance skillfully to their
beats. Maybe we should do it sometime.

>(4) How do you learn the drumming/dancing/singing combo?  Is there a Hare
>Krsna camp somewhere?

The style originated from India and was duplicated all over the world. I
believe that the drumming/dancing/singing needs a lot of improvement. Maybe
it is because there are no lessons. I hope some day in the future they hook
up some tech 12's and mix some sweet break beats and then you can really
get into it. They have too much high end sound with their cymbals and not
enough good drum beats.

There is a Hare Krsna community called New Vridavan outside of Moundsville
near the hills Az was talking about. They have a thrown together web site
at www.newvrindavan.com if you want to check it out.

>(5) Do you rehearse or improvise or what?

If you live at the temple you wake everyday at 4:30 a.m. and dance for
about an hour and sing Sanskrit hymns praising Krsna. You basically do
whatever you want to. I don't know anyone who rehearses it is all pretty
basic.

>(6) Do you go to regular barbers and ask for a Hare Krsna cut or is that a
>custom/ritual type thing to be done by another Hare Krsna?

Krsna's ( as they are sometimes called ) belive that cleanliness is
important and by cutting their hair they keep cleaner and show that they
are not on the bodily platform. It really doesn't matter to them who cuts
their hair, it is a pretty simple hair cut, and is hard to mess up.

>(7) What do you do if, say, somebody trips over his robe-thing, or if the
>drummer misses a beat?

come on what kind of question is that! Maybe they take the guy out back and
beat him till he promises to not mess up again ; ). What do you do when you
mess up a beat while drumming or trip while dancing?

FYI I don't mind the questions feel free to ask as many you want, I love
the philosophical questions. Actually at this community there used to be
about 400 kids back in 1984 were while being raised in the Gurukula ( an
education system that tried to raise the kids using the Vedic methods used
thousands of years ago in India ). There is still a small crew  of us that
are still around the area, and most of us are into good beats and go to
raves often. There are very few gurukula kids who still follow the
principles that are required for spiritual advancement in Krsna
consciousness ie. NO meat eating, NO sex unless you want kids, NO
intoxication, and NO gambling. Now you might understand why many of us
don't follow the principles ( although we are all vegetarians and don't
gamble too often ).

K.D. and I have some equipment ie: good scanner, kick ass laser printer,
and a decent cd burner that we could use to contribute to the group. We
could help out if you guys want us to design flyers, scan pictures for a
PB-CLE web site (is there one or would that be good idea?). 

any ways that is enough for now, hope to hear more from you all soon,
bhima

goes! Im trained to follow him to raves, and now, im stuck on my own in the 
middle of the rave world, having to think for myself.  Sigh.

 Especially after having gotten kinda used to being in jeffs all the time? 
:)  Im gunna miss him/you when he is in DC. Goddamnit I hate having to find 
new people with rides to leech er I mean party with regularly.  I WANT A 
FUCKING CAR! SOMEONE BUY ME A CAR DAMMIT!  NOW! :)  I swear, if i ever get 
a car in pgh area I would gladly be the designated rave carpooler cuz I 
know how much it sucks to be without a regular ride.  Jeff has been my 
savior recently and now my messiah is going to be traipsing elsewhere... 
Sigh..

Its just easier to go back to bed.

i got stuck at fucking work today. 5:15 til 9:30. my boss calls at 8:30,
tells us to go home, before the storm hits.

dumbfuck should have called us at 8. as soon as i head out towards my car,
*wham*, it hits. and my car does NOT behave as advertized in that kinda
downpour and wind. so coworker and i hole up in office, playing quake.

ends up being 9:30 before we leave anyways. 

so we leave, and she heads to cuyahoga falls, and i head towards berea. on
80, about 8 miles before exit 11 west, *WHAM*, it hits again. i'm doing 45
on a tri-lane, and nobody dares pass me. plus, they're doing about 20. 

it abates as i'm coming up on 11, so now there's only standing water to
deal with. not a big thing, right? yeah, right. sure. only 3" of the shit
all over.

then it hits again, and i pull into service plaza, and park. i go inside,
get some mcdonalds, listen to some bitch fight with the manager over
nothing, have a cigarette, look outside, still undrivable. so i go over to
the stupid games, and plop $.50 into the pinball game, without noticing a
jammed ball. so i hit start, and it goes 'searching for ball'. and shuts
off. then turns back on, does the diagnostic mode thing. i hit enter for
the status report, and it dies again. starts again, skips diags, i hit
start, it searches for ball, and dies totally. fun, yeah.

so i waste another 30 minutes. finally it's driveable. so i leave and head
home. it's about 10:45 when i leave. we're doing ~60-65MPH, then we hit
the bridge. i start weaving, doing about 75, since there's no water. as
soon as i'm off the bridge, here it is again. so i slow down, finally get
off on 10, tkae almost 20 minutes to drive home cuz of all the bloody
water, and finally sit down, soaked. 

what a beautiful fucking day.

those dj's aren't cheap.  in "the average raver's mind", headlining dj's are
all the same, while some may cost around 600 and some around 2000, which most
of the dj's spinning at nocturnal emissions cost.  saturday in cleveland has a
more prestigious lineup than 95% of the parties throw in the pb-cle area in
the last year, easily..  no, there is no dj funk or bad boy bill, or even dj
dan and terry mullan, just detroit minimal techno GOD = Robert Hood, one of
techno's original 3 = Kevin Saunderson, one of germany's (holland) most known
and talented techno/speed garage dj's producers = Robert De La Gauthier, one
of america's best tech - house dj's = Felix Da Housecat..   

you can have 65 whoever dj's and pay them 100 bucks a piece, pay 25 bucks for
the party; and hear some teenage kids play their favourite records, 
or you can pay 25 bucks to hear the people that made the records play them
live for you.  -  i guess this is just a matter of personal taste.

quality not quantity.

possible, maybe even probable. lot of tornado and severe t-storm activity.
we lost all electiricity at work as i was leaving. i'm on my own massive
backup array right now. (3 7' tall 19" racks of APC1400's) i guess there's
a couple segments of line down from a tree or two. i can see 'em working
on it down the street. hopefully they'll be done in less than 2.5 hrs or
i'm gonna lose power totally here. :(

It is definitely a challenge to provide both quality DJs as well as the names that
the crowd will actually be willing to pay for.  For instance, Sasha and Digweed?
They're supposedly the best of the best (for that type of music, of course).
It's frustrating to an event organizer who's trying to bring new DJs into the
area.  For Intergalactic Circus, for example, I've booked Thomas Michael who is a
God out west but not known as well here.  Also Friction & Spice.  DJs are familiar
with them because they produce but not many ravers know who they are.  And these
guys aren't cheap.  It's important to balance a line-up between the "popular" (so
to speak) and the lesser knowns (even if they do happen to be the founding
fathers!).
I still would keep most parties $20 or less.  If 1,000 people show that's a
$20,000 budget and most parties can be done for that.  Unless you're talking about
a Family Affair or Bang2 line-up.  Of course those are higher budget events.

hi everybody!!

don't have lots of time to go into a detailed review cuz i'm busy
getting shite ready for my party tomorrow, but let me just say that i
know that *lots* of people, myself included, had an *awesome* time at
commencement last night... as far as the tightness of the vibe at a
party, i don't think any party i've been to has topped this one...

i know there may have been some problems with turnout or djs or
whatever, but trouty and eric, you guys throw a fucking awesome party,
period.

i'll try to make a longer version of this later, but here are a *few* of
many shoutouts from last night:

the guys at battered armadillo
    -trouty (HAPPY GRADUATION!!)
    -eric

*jade* : )   (..and all of her friends...)

the whole pbs crew whom i rode down and back with:
    -tom, ike, john, geoff, and company...

the *many* new people i met. here are a *few*:
    -steve from the list
    -jeremy
    -the girl who's moving to flordia next to larry bird  : )
    -tons of other people

and of course
    -dan, cool as hell, as always!
    -and the asian dude who was busting it out on the dance floor the
whole nite...


well, i've gotta go, but thanks to everyone for the awesome time at
comencement...

one last reminder, tomorrow is *my graduation party*!!  everyone is
welcome to come check it out! the weather is supposed to be *nice*!!!
<..for real!!> :-)

take care.

peace,

--spike

how's everybody doin this cool saturday afternoon?

i'm doin' alright myself, went to commecement, didn't get into any car
accidents, got a couple of hours of sleep, and it's all good in
general :) that's the short version :)

i didn't even think i was going to commencement @ all, because thre is
no fuckin way that my parents would ever let me drive to youngstown to
spin @ a rave, i didn't think that my parents would let me sleep over
@ my friend's house because i just did that last nite. anyways, after
a good bit of convincing, i got to accompany todd + we got to spin
together as circuit 6.

we tried to get to the party before 12:00 (cause that's when junior
liscenses expire), but we ended up getting there after 1:00... oh
well. that rain was a BITCH. at one point, we hit a puddle @ 50 mph,
and the entire windshield was covered in water and we couldnt see shit
(like the pittsburgh plunge!). 

...anyways, so we showed up sorta late (cause we're dj's and we're
cool like dat ;) and were a wee bit suprised about the space. it was
just someone's crib, located next to a bunch of other people's cribs.
i was suprised that it didn't get shut down, but someone told me that
there were actually only 2 neighbors, and one was deaf (or sumptin
like dat).

there were two rooms, one downstairs (the living room, i guess) with a
decent light setup and a nice enuff sound system. there was a large
dancefloor, but as whole, there wasn't much dancing goin on @
commencement. the room upstairs was smaller, and has two turntables
and mad computers, so people could do live pa's. the coolest part
about the upstairs was that there was sound out in the hall and in the
room across the hall (which also had lights), so there was plenty of
dance room, even if you couldn't see the dj or performer. one of the
pa guys was set up in the closet, so i walked into the room and
thought a tape was just playin, so i went over to the mixer and
started cuttin up. the guy preforming was suprised, but eventually we
just grooved :) i was all suprised to find out he was the source of
the music and i felt kinda bad for fuckin with his set, but he was
pretty friendly about it.

...and there was the upstairs, too, which had a rather large couch and
two chairs. i met trouty's "house-sharing" guy or whatever. he was an
interesting fella, with a bottle of wine tied onto his belt, a cup
balanced precariously on his knee while hittin from a bowl, and
talking to me non stop about how he used to live in athens georgia and
he knew these kkids who went to parties known as the robotwins cause
they would down mad bottles of robutussin :)

anyways, the music was pretty good. mainly jungle... dj tiko (who's
lurkin on the list somewhere) spun a nice selection of dark shit, some
other guy spun jumpup and dark shit, then we spun (i'll let someone
else review that). we had fun, tho. point alpha didn't show, and
that's a shame. neither did the instigator :(

i took mad pictures of dapwezz, jade73733377, dan k, geoff, tom, todd,
me, trouty, and i think some of jon, ian + cru...  (hi to all) -- i'll
probably get them up on the internet by the end of the summer :)

on the way home, about 1 hour into the trip dan kelly sped by us
gettin' bizzy with his bomb-ass 'girlfriend' so we pulled up next to
him and  started beepin + shit... we got pictures of that, too - those
should be fun. 

so we made it home safe (@7:00), and slept in this house that todd's
house-sitting for, and i headed back home to see if i had been busted
or not, and i wasn't! that made me very very happy. this whole "lack
of pittsburgh raves" thing this summer is kinda sad. oh well, who's
goin to steel city on tuesday? you know i am :) summer's still kickin
in for me + i'm just luvin it.
 
well, THAT's the longest review of commecement you'll see probably :)

over+out
...frankie g

ps - todd: skillz :)

what's up everybody?

dieselboy's bound to come back to steel city this summer, right?
well... someone who throws renegades should organize a renegade during
the time he'll be here, and ask him to spin @ it. he could spin 1993
shit, and he'd be rinsin' it renegade stylee like back he did in the
day. he'd probably accept too, because every junglist that left
pittsburgh still remembers their roots in the scene here. 

that's nice how 187 + d.cypol are gonna kick it with hossam @ life is
but a dream. old school style special, ferreaal.

...just a random thought brought to you in part by

Jamie, 
 I tried calling several times (starting around 9:30 pm) to leave a message to
get ahold of me.  I realize that it is VERY difficult if not impossible to
check messages during a party, but I tried regardless.  I had been in Detroit
for Kraftwerk since 8 oclock the previous night, and stayed MUCH longer than
expected.  I even made Viktor drive VERY fast in the hard rain in order to get
me home with ample time.  Well, I got back to Cleveland at around 9 oclock
(but i live in canton, not cleveland).  I had 3 of my friends pick up my
turntables to bring to the party since I wouldn't be there until later, but
they ended up not going due to the bad weather.  Apparently, there had
actually been a tornado about 10 minutes from their house, so they stayed home
(although I was under the impression that they had left for the event).
 I finally get back to my house at around 11 oclock (the drive was VERY slow
due to the hard rain).  I had all of my equipment packed into my friend
marty's car, who was going to be driving me, since my car is out of
commission.  While i was home, i failed to check my messages (being in a BIG
hurry) so i didn't directly get viktor's phone message.  I was on my way to
youngstown when we decided to quickly stop at my other friend's house to pick
up more phunktion flyers to take up to the party.  As soon as i walk in the
door, everyone at the house screams "it's cancelled".  I go inside to learn
that my mom had called over there with news that the event had been cancelled
due to whatever reasons.  I call my house and listen to my messages and sure
enough, there is a message from viktor saying that "[teknova} john and matt
had heard that the event was cancelled due to loss of venue and/or weather
conditions, and that point alpha had left a message on viktor's machine
leaving a similar story".
i tried several times again to call your voicemail jamie to see if you
actually had left a message saying "party's cancelled, stay home" but found
none.  I was at this point completely confused about what to do.  Since all of
the reason's that I heard that the party was cancelled seemed valid, we opted
to stay here and not drive the 75 minutes to youngstown in bad driving
conditions to find out for absolutely sure that the event had been cancelled.
I know that you were having problems with your email account or whatever
Jamie, but I hadn't received ANY direct information from you since last week
at Trilogy.  

I sincerely APOLOGIZE for my not showing, and if there is ANYTHING that I can
do to make it up to you I will be more than happy to.

Lou

OK, most of the shit I would have said has already been said, but all in
all I had a great time, even if there weren't many people there.  The
only thing that bothered me was the lack of people dancing.  

But even that, there were some dedicated heads who kept it alive the
whole time: Jade, Spike, some other girl that was there who could really
dance with longish hair, the aisan dude gettin BUSY, Beverly Budde and
anyone else I forgot.

Like Frankie said, it was tough as hell driving . . . . but we made it. 
I was very suprised with the house, but really liked it.  It is perfect
for a house party.  

Some reviews of DJs:

Really tall guy with a beater on:
I don't know what the deal with this guy is, but he was tearin' it up! 
When I arrived he was playing some slow breaks/hip hop and scratching
with skills.  Making tearing sounds and exhibiting great crossfader work.
 And then I came back in a few minutes and he was playing speed garage. 
With timestretched "Sound Bwoy" samples and stuff.  It was nutty

The jungle brothers:
The weren't the real jungle brothers, but they were brothers and they
both played jungle so the name seemed appropriate.  But one of them
started out with jump up and old school stuff, and slowly changed to
darker more futuristic stuff at the end.  He was pretty good.
His brother who was up stairs, (when I heard him) was playing some flat
out jump up, with 5,4,3,2,1 (I hated to play that song in our set as
well, but its so good!), and "Trick of Technology", and oldie but goodie.

Suprisingly most of the music was jungle . . . it was strange cause I was
prepared for a night of techno and trance . . . oh well.

I wish I could've seen more live PAs.  I only a little bit of live stuff,
but what I did see was cool.

Big up all the crews in the area:
PBS (geoff, tom etc), spike, jade1234 :), The President of the United
States of America (DaPwezz/steve), Dan Kelly in his fast as hell car
flying by us on the highway! all the people that were there that I didn't
know but seemed real cool.

Catch ya later,

ABSOLUT @

lou, i dont have your phone number. and didnt get the msg that you had
called until the day of the party when i'm pulling my hair out.  i checked
my VM around maybe 11 to see if there were and msgs and there were none
other than the usual silliness that ppl like to leave after getting direx.
my mini-set was fun, but kept it short so everyone who brought records
could spin. 
i really had fun until the aftermath when i realized what a bomb it was. 
ironically we had a surplus army dummy bomb there to put near the tables
for ADM BOMs set.
hmmmmm.  bad omen i guess.
i dunno it just seems like such a conspiracy against me when trevor
supposedly was in a car on the way there and decided to get dropped off and
not show.  lou no shows and i have no idea why till 8am when i check my
voice mail and stuff.
point alpha decides not to come without really telling me.  i pretty much
expected them to cancel after my talk with owen.  bob brown didnt show got
VM this afternoon with an apology that he didnt get home til late as in 2am
and wouldnt make it for when i had wanted him to spin.  fred didnt show coz
someone (i believe my stoner roommate) told him it was bumped to saturday.
the wrath of god and the weather.  a huge branch fell on my friend petes
car and dented the last body panel that wasnt dented or scratched.  he was
a rather good sport about it saying it had to happen sooner or later.
roadrunner dropping my mail and connections which are oddly enough perfect
now that the party is over.
my former battered armadillo associate with the lights being a total
fucking asshole over god knows what and pouting all morning and not telling
us what his problem is.  i just ignored him and probably will continue to
do so.
if there is a god, he really didnt want this party to happen.

well, what to say, what to say...
first off, i live a whole half hour at most from where this party was, but for
some reason it took us 3 hours to get there!!!!  i knew the way, and told the
driver of my little carpool where to go, but to no heed...and ended up *very*
very far from where we needed to be...oh well...
i got there around 2am, and was instantly greeted with the other concerned
half of my group...assured everyone we weren't dead and, then headed on
inside...
...my first smile was seeing trouty and a few other net-geeks as i just got
in, and then i went to check out the music.....
the super tall boy, (who no one seems to know who is) was given a mad set, and
i got to start the evening dancing, so i was happy........on and on through
the night, i heard *alot* of jungle...and dont' get me wrong, i like jungle,
but after so long, one seeks variety.......
...i wanted to hear frankie g and todd spin so i listened and danced to them
for awhile then went to check out the upstairs ....and was happily greeted by
a *great* but short set by trouty, it was exactly what i was looking to hear
at the time, and i was all smiles with his "canteena" (sp?) remix...welp,
after problems with the a needle on one of the tables, i headed back down to
catch a the end of circuit 6, and then i do believe tom went on...i chilled
for most his set, and danced too, cause my spirits were high, but i was sorta
disappointed that alot of times i found i was alone on the dance floor, and
sometimes, one or two others joined in ...but over all  not many peeps were
dancing ..hmmm.....well....i checked out the upstiars agian, to find it was
shut down..and headed back, to hear the beginning of cut-up's set....
....hehehe and all i gotta say, is i got to do some crazy (happy) hardcore
dancing during his set...and after a mainly jungle night, it was just what i
needed...though the fact that he was on at 5am, was a bit hard on the ol'
body, but hell, no complaints here :) and during this most everyone who was
still there, was dancing, which i was very glad to see
...after him Adam went back on downstairs this time, and played to for some
time while i was outside,..i felt the urge to continue dancing and went back
in and got a final set with him...it was pretty damn neat, cause i was just me
dancing to him, it was definatly the perfect end to a great night....

welp, i suppose some personal recongnition is due to some of the fellow geeks
there ::
~Trouty = thanks for the great fuckin time, and sorry it didn't turn out
better for ya
~Dan K = you definatly made my night all the brighter, love ya bro =^)~
~Spike = i'm *so* happy ya made it, and i hope to meet up again SOON
~Tom, Frankie g, Todd, cut-up, and all the others who spun, thanks for the
night of dancing, smiles, and hugs
~to anyone else i saw..and can't remember names, sorry, my memories just not
to great, but i had a blast
~and of course Steve = thanks for the place to crash and the ride home, had a
wonderful time

,,,and maybe i'll see everyone tonight (?)

...well enough babbling from me!

one tired, but happy girlie

i had fun until we had to deal with brian, the lighting-asshole and load up
the gear.  at least i lived ~1/2 mile from there, the sound came from pgh i
feel bad for them, but i think they're crashing here and running it to pgh
and then they said they might hit spikes grad party if they can.
i hope to make it, but we'll see what happens after tonite, i still want to
go to dayton, but am not up for the drive, so i might hit cle instead.

Hello Everyone-
For all of you with your own apartment/house who use long distance
service.  I've recently started a new job and am offering 10 cents a
minute with Excel long distance.  The rates are NOT subject to change
(most offers you see on TV with Sprint, AT&T are).  It only takes a
minute over the phone to switch and would also help me out.  Also
available are 800 #s, free pagers, and good internat'l rates too.  All
rates for these are the lowest around too.  E-mail back with any
questions.
Thanx!
-Kelly

That's a weird random thought...what happened were you listening to
'witness the strength' or something last night? ;)  It'd be cool to me.

You could have a pretty big jungle event just from the jungle dj's who've
left (or will soon leave pgh):  Dieselboy, 187, Farmer Tea, Grrl13,
Saint..

Sorry to say this, but while hossam has been an *awesome* supporter of
this event, he's technically not on the final lineup because he will
possibly be elsewhere due to real life responsibily things.  We're hoping
he can make it, but its entirely uncertain.  187 & D.Cypol *will* be there
though, with the oldskool special. :)

well...about a half hour after I arrived i started feeling mas sick and spent
most of my time crashed on a couch or on the floor.  However i caught random
parts of sets and what i heard sounded very tight.....i dont know his name but
the cat that dropped before circut 6 with the backwards hat, dropped a few
stellar tracks.  Circut6 was sounding pretty solid (the best part about them
was todd running out from behind the tables and dancing to his own set)  i
would have to say the highlight of the night for me though would have to be
doc cut up breaking in to some of my favorite happy hardcore tunes just as the
sun was comin up.....

	i wanna send an apology out to all those who i rode home with...im sure my
sick self was rather obnoxious....i slept all of saturday and should be back
in action for spike's party

why don't you guys that want parties under $25 get
together, and actually make a party on your own? 
It'll probably be not that easy, at first, but once you 
get the ball rolling it'll be a great party. I mean, check
it, get some people from the list who spin, have them dj, 
get some people who actually make their own music from
the list, have them do live p.a's, groove the place. man.

a bit late, but this is the first i've been at my house and been awake 
since then......i was rather dissappointed by the overall turnout of 
performers/dj's and the general public....i was expecting to see more of 
the list there, but i guess there were weather problems in the area etc.
i liked most of what i heard....alot more jungle than i 
expected.....circuit 6's set was weak as expected.....;)
just kidding, i liked their stuff, but theyre my boys, so my opinion 
dont count:)
i missed trout's p.a. cuz i had no idea that he was doing it, but he did 
an encore of the cantina tune for a few of us, and it was rockin like a 
piece of granite
my set was overall the best of the night (just kidding:) 
i only spun 4 songs cuz i like hearing geoff dj more than i like 
spinning myself, so i got off of the decks and let him rock me and the 
other 6 heads on the dancefloor with the early morning happyhardcore 
set....the vibe was still in mad effect @ 6:30 or so when i left... it 
seems like everyone who went had lots of fun, myself included...
mad big ups to the net crew, jade37373737333373737373733, dapwezz, dan 
kelly, spike, geoff, absolut, frankie g., etc..
sorry you had to take a los on this one trouty, it was still a phat 
party, and its not your fault....i thoroughly enjoyed myself....

peace, toM

So --everyone who went: how was it??? 

I wish I could have been there, but it was not possible. I'd really like
to know how 3D, Saunderson, and Rob Hood were. How about the Mining
Company? 


Reviews, anyone?

Kate

I arrived at the space, which was at a fairly large club in a shopping plaza
in west cleveland, at around 12:30.  i walk in to see a sign that read,
"robert hood will not be here tonite due to a motorcycle accident.  he is
alright but he has broken his leg.  sorry for the dissappointment"  well, rob
hood is probably in my top 5 favourite musicians of all time, so i was pretty
bummed out.  (now i am DEFINITELY going to have to have him play live at one
of our parties)  other than this, the party was completely awesome.  

felix da housecat opened up with richie hawtin's spastik, which i believe was
the first techno after a while of drum n bass from 3d, so people went nuts.
he continuued for nearly 2 hours with a finely mixed set of hard house and
techno

hyperactive came on next and started out sorta slow.  i thought he was going
to spin house, but after about 30 minutes of decent tech-house, he started
spinning HARD techno.  

next was kevin saunderson, who also started out with some groovy house.  he
did spin about 30 minutes of techno at the end of his set.  i thought he was
excellent, and i don't know why is the most underrated of detroit's original
techno pioneers. 

last was robert de la gauthier (from holland/germany)  i saw robert in
pittsburgh awhile ago; i liked him then, i liked him now.  i remember alot of
people on the list talking about how bad of a dj he was and thinking they were
smoking crack or something.  he does tend to scratch a beat and throw off
timing when there is a big buildup, but other than that, he is superb.  he
opened up with his mega-hit "pussy shaver" which he played for about 5
minutes.  then went into a WAY too slow version of special k or bumps of k or
whatever it is called.  then he went into his "woodstock brown acid
warning/adam beyer track/underworld bassline" which was off of cd or dat but
it had the sort of precision that just isnt possible to do at a party.  i
think robert had the highest percentage of people at the party dancing all
night, and people were completely flipping out for the first 30 minutes of his
set, and stayed dancing hard until 8 oclock.  

i thought the venue was going to be all decked out with stupid shit for the
club, but it turned out to be one of the coolest venues i have ever been in.
HOPEFULLY, stupid fucking kids won't tag it, break shit, or do anything else
to FUCK UP this venue, since it is definitely not too easy to find a new space
in cleveland.

that would be cool except in order to do a renagade it  needs to be on
a weekend and from what i know he doesn't have any free for a while.
also when he comes out it is usually between stops and only for 24
hours or so.

I got there in the middle of 3d's set, which I really liked, but I 
just couldn't get a groove..wasn't in a jungle frame of mind..then 
felix came on and kind of hit me like a ton of bricks :)  That was 
just what I needed..I didn't follow the dj's too much throughout the 
night, except for robert de la gauthier, who I thought was 
incredible..I can't understand how anybody could *not* like him ;)

Yea, I didn't know what to expect from the space - I had heard it was 
a teen club, and my little sister told me she had been there and 
thought it was pretty big and would hold about 300 people (she 
obviously has no concept of size/people stuff)..I was very pleasantly 
surprised when we arrived..coming down those stairs, through the 
plastic into this huge, cavernous dark room was awesome! This is 
definitely one of my favorite spaces..I hope we can keep it..

I think the only complaint I really had was that it was awfully hot, 
but i think John said they had the AC for 2 days straight before the 
party..maybe some of those huge fans would help?  Other than that I 
think Teknova did threw a superb party, I haven't had so much fun in 
cleveland in a long time :)  Oooh yea! I also picked up Dubtribe live 
from Family which is just fucking awesome - It totally reminds me of 
family affair last year, can't wait for this year!

hey everyone on the list i am back from the boston metro area:

i know everyone is fused to their monitors now.  well, i went up to boston
university for the orientation thingy, registered for classes, et cetera.
anyone from pittsburgh on this list going there next year?  no.  it is so
different from pittsburgh, the cost of living is like multiplied by 1.45
dollars so everyone is walking around in j. crew and j.crew-variant type
clothing -- pretty freaky!  nylon, rayon, everywhere!  i spent the entire
time looking for faults in the city, also looking for the underground areas.
i found a few clubs, correct me if you know anything, but i think that is
all i am going to get in terms of raves in the immediate boston area.
nunetheless, judging from some of the fliers, i am in for a good quasi hard
techno/trance/house time.  oh shit, another thing, every car has booty
techno emanating from it (it reminded me of being at daytona beach) so, if
booty techno runs rampant on the common streets, these people must really
know how to rip shit up.  i am sad to see that remiximatosys has been
cancelled, i am really looking forward to these final-pittsburgh summer
events (joy is like the day before i leave, bring it home H0S!!! =] )
everyone gave out their ICQ numbers..here is mine: pound839007.

fondly,

Andy

*sigh* well, my boss and i reached an agreement today, which was my last
day. he can't afford to pay me any more, or give me more hours. and i
can't live on what he was paying. 

so does anybody know of any openings in the cleveland area for network
engineers, or system administrators? i gotta find something fast, or i'm
not going to be able to make my insurance payment this month. :(

Totally cool but just a comment...
Are there going to be renegades held on random nights where no other event is/was
planned?  There seems to be little to do from now til Interglaactic Circus in
Pittsburgh.

Do you have *any* reason for those feelings?  I mean, is there 
anything that you specificly disliked? there's gotta be *something*

Due to the overwhelmingly positive response to the idea of a pb-cle
oriented party, the projekthaus has come out of semi-retirement to host
this event. The general idea here is that there will be open turntables
all day long and grills for people to put food on. (There will be separate
grills for meat and vegetarian foods). So bring some vinyl and some
burgers or a tofu dog (or pop or potato salad or chips and dip or whatever
else tickles your fancy). Now for the important stuff:

	Date: June 28th, this is a Sunday
	Time: 2:00 pm to about 10:00 pm
	Location: @ das projekthaus, 6806 Thomas Blvd, Pittsburgh

I will post full direx here later and they'll also be available on the
haus info line: 661-mskw (but don't check yet 'cause I haven't updated it
in a long time). For those of you who know you will be spinning drop me a
little e-mail. For all of you who offered to help in some way...the best
thing you could do is come as early as possible so we can get this thing
started with a bang and not a whimper. Gracias mi amigos! See you all on
Sunday.

Love and mixes-
mskw1
projekthaus direktor

I just wanted to give a shout out to both Trouty and Spike, for having
some very fun events this past weekend.   I had an excellent time @ both
Commencement and Graduation.  

Sorry about the turnout trout - i wish that house was in pgh, because it
would be an awesome spot.

Spike: thanks for an awesome time - hope you had a good one yourself,
because I definitely did.  A lovely day in the sun.  It was great hearing
some good music during the day for a change - and with other stuff to do
too.  I'm all for more things like Spikes just for the hell of it.

Mad props to all the kids who spun or entertained for free:  Trouty with
the cantina tune!!!, the 'jungle bros' as absolut put it, the lighting guy
@ troutys who played some wicked acid trance, Kali the Priestess of
Rotterdam, of course the Circuit 6 Crew (very nice stuff - check out their
'manifesto' if you haven't) and DJ Reliant with the summer jazz... :)

For all you kiddies in pgh:

www.clublaga.com

Its got the show listings, clubnights, and even the technical specs of the
space....i was kinda surprized that they have a website.

<<<<<<<Do you have *any* reason for those feelings?  I mean, is there

i guess it's sorta silly. normally i would have really gotten into the music,
as soon as i got there i only wanted to dance, but then something went wrong.
i flipped out. i was scared and shaking and on the verge of tears. i thought
everyone in the establishment felt the way that i did. i couldn't understand
why everyone was still dancing instead of leaving. i know that the darkness of
the club, the sound level of the music, and being followed by security all
night had something to do with how i felt. this really has nothing to do with
how good or bad a party is, but i hate not being able to see people's faces.
it makes it hard to make new friends or something. perhaps i can blame the
chemicals i fed my body instead of the actual party for my hatred. i don't
know.

Sorry to hear it.  If you did acid, my advice is don't do it again at a 
party unless you feel totally comfortable with the space.  Of course, I 
have no idea what you took.  There was also a batch of MDE going around 
(although there was MDMA being sold also), and this stuff can make 
people feel confused and disoriented, not mention possibly a little 
sick.

>and being followed by security all
>night had something to do with how i felt. 

I had some security guy keep shining a flashlight at my (empty) right 
hand and it really annoyed me.  And once when I was taking a break, 
lying down, a guy shined a light right into my eyes until I looked away.
Overall, I thought the party was pretty fun -- good music started around 
3-something (I think that was Kevin Saunderson?), but I did think the 
bass was too strong.  It created actual wind, and I hate the feeling of 
my chest and throat vibrating.

anyone care to share fav. experiences (live or recorded) with bands?  right
now i'm especially into groovy music like stereo mc's and anyone on giant step
records.  some of my best experiences have been with funksters like liquid
soul and brooklyn funk essentials ...

also i saw madonna's video for the title track from "ray of light" today made
by someone i had never heard of.  but she never ceases to amaze me ...

and i feel it

thats what i like.   good clean loud muzak!

the sound was good there, i wasnt really overwhelmed by the quality of the
music, but there were some good stuff now and then.
i tried to leave 4 times, but every time i'd say bye to ppl and start
heading for the door, some cool track would come on so i'd run back and say
hi to everyone again and try leaving after a bit.

what was up with the name "nocturnal emmision".  gross.

glad to see some of the pb-cle-massive there =)
dapwezz, dan, amanda?, oba, brian conti (of sphere),  __lou__&__viktor__
(who were the FIRST ppl i saw there oddly enough)

What exactly did you take?  I've had that kind of experience on acid 
(that's why I stopped doing this)..I sat in a corner shaking for 
about 4 hours in columbus..and my soundtrack was T1000's evil hard 
techno..best freakout I ever had ;-)

Yea, the security was kinda anoying - waking people up an shit and 
shining their lights everywhere, directly in peopls faces..grrr

My rave experience lately has been alot different than it used to 
be..I havn't been meeting many new people at all, and it's become 
more a very personal experience so not being able to see people 
wasn't too much of a bummer for me, but I do agree, it was aweful 
dark in there :)

I didn't run into anybody who had a bad pill, everybody seemed really 
happy..I had a molecule that was just incredible, but I havn't done E 
in well over a year, so even a shitty pill probably would have been 
incredible to me :) I think your best bet, and the best possible 
advice is just to know who you're getting your shit from..don't buy 
right away, wait a while and see who's gettin off really well and see 
where they got theirs...be careful...etc, etc

I thought the music was kickin' all night..of course I'm happy with 
just about anything with a straight beat on a large sound system..I 
thought the sound was perfect, not that I know sound very well at 
all, but it seemed pretty clean to me, and the bass was incredible!  
The only time I thought it was going a little overboard was when they 
pushed it *waaaaay* up for robert dela gauthier...but i was still 
lovin it :) 

Chris

ps - does anybody know where I could get ahold of a tape of robert de 
la gautier?  I would love to find a recording of him somewhere!

Quick review of yesterday (Spikes Graduation Party):

"A Great Day in the Park"

that just about sums it up.  There was plenty of good music, stuff to do,
and people to chill with.

I expected a more "preppy suburban" group of people from Spike's school,
but found that most of the people there weren't like that at all.  ALL
the DJs set's were great, and they were all very different.  KALI's set
was just great hardcore, DJ Lounge Lizard . . . . oops I mean DJ
Reliant/Gunsmoke/toM's set was definitely styled as hell, kicked the
refined elevator music style.  No seriously, it was great, smooth jazzy
selections. I was pleased with Circuit 6's performance.  We dropped some
roller's as well as some jump up and maybe a dark/intelligent track
thrown in as well.  MSKW's set was also a great unique style, with
selections ranging from trip hop, to old school kraftwerk stuff to acid
breaks.  I've never heard anything like it before, but hope to again. 
Geoffrey's set was wicked.  Some selections were dark and futuristic as
hell and others were just staight up old school style mash up jungle
(V-V-V I-I-I P-P-P-P-P-P Dub-Dub-Dub Plate-Plate-Plate Biz-Biz
Ni-i-i-is).

Best mix of the day goes to toM for the bold choice of "No Diggedy" out
of some jazzy as hell song.  I never thought I'd hear black street
kickin' it with some laid back 100.7 style jazz and a little jungle
thrown in as well  . . . . . and on top of that all have it sound REALLY
good.

After the main day at the park we packed up and moved our shit to Spike's
crib, where we set up the tables and sound system again as Circuit 6
played a smoother selection of jungle and heads chilled and went buck
wild on a huge trampoline.

Getting home was a BIT confusing, but we managed.

Thanks Spike,

ABSOLUT

>we need more outdoor free parties!!!!!!

True dat, and I know a good place for them: Lower Frick Park.  People
have parties there all the time on the weekends, and often times they
bring bangin' systems that you can hear clearly all the way up in Regent
Square, but the cops can't do anything cause they have a permit.  Def.
something to look into.

Everyones been talking about free parties, we do need some 
free parties in Cleveland. I think there are parties at nelson's 
ledges  (geauga county) every now and then.
I personally haven't checked them out, but heard they were
rad. I might check it out sometime soon, try and get info to
you people in Cleveland. The cops don't have permits to go there
so thats a plus. I'll check it out on Friday Night or saturday and
get back to you guys on here.

-ca

has anyone been to these ledges?

real rebels would be pushing their attendees to educate themselves about 
the drugs they take.  issues like individual dose sensitivity ARE 
important, but anyone coming to a party, especially those taking 
chemicals, have a vital need to educate themselves.  if you are a true 
socio-chemical revolutionary, you have an OBLIGATION to tell the kids 
what's up!  But you don't deserve to swing on some motherfucking cross 
(or should i say a couple of bullshit sticks tacked together with a 
nail?) just because stupid shits that don't care will continue to behave 
like punks when confronted.

this message also goes out to the "raver" who "hated" nocturnal 
emissions for "no reason."  yeah, maybe, just maybe, it was the 
"chemicals you ingested"...what the fuck is wrong with you?  somebody 
calm me down before i REALLY snap.

jesus may have died for your sins, but he never did shit for me,
art gravity

I hope that the reason all of you guys are going to hear Lady Miss Kier
attempt to spin dnb is because you can't afford to go to Columbus to hear
some real dnb djs.

OK, this is just something that my crew has discovered in the last couple
weeks:

If you want to have a good time, get a boombox full of batteries and good
music, and go somewhere secluded in the middle of the night.  You can
turn the boombox up loud, dance, chill whatever.  Its a nice thing to do
and definitely a change of pace from the normal shit you do.  Som
suggested places: in the middle of the woods in a clearing, in a canal,
and the best of all, in a little room behind your favorite run down
grocery store :)

Very good thoughts on drug education.  If I had the facts, and not just some
shady guy saying "try it for free," I could have saved myself a bad experience.

Thank you.  I was about to unsub b/c _nobody_ else on this list told this
person off.  I mean, there was a "do acid around ppl you trust" message, but
no "hey, maybe you can't handle drugs."  btw, I found a new, safe, legal,
and cheap drug, guarana.  Yes, it's the same stuff in Josta that supposedly
makes you horny, but I had 2 pills and it didn't.  It was a slow (3 hours or
so) steady energy source for me.  And I didn't get bored.  With tons of
speakers blasting great music, and all sorts of weird lights and friendly
ppl walking around (that is, the people were walking around, the lights
stayed put :), I don't see why everyone wants to be warped even further into
a parallel dimension.

Big ups for dissing jesus, but I don't see how it is relevant here.

it isn't i was just a litttle upset, and get carried away sometimes.  as 
a believer in religious freedom, i didn't intend that statement as an 
affront to anyone's personal beliefs, but it just seemed to me an 
obvious link between two situations involving a lot of faith in little 
substantial fact.

less annoyed than ususal,

Say, don't just assume that because a drug grows naturally that it's
safe... I mean... pot grows naturally, mushrooms, peyote... I'm not
saying those are safe or are not... but also consider the number of
things you can pick naturally that would kill you on the spot. Bleah...
everything I've read on the net says that the "Natural" herbal
substitutes are often more dangerous than the real thing...

Anyone headed to the Caffene Tour this weekend?

-Amy


Quick introduction, hi, I'm Alex.  I am at CMU.  I have been reading 
this list for a while, but I haven't posted anything til now.  I'm on 
ICQ my # is 11909549 (Bloodrage)  So now to get to the point, I'd love 
to go to the Caffiene party this friday in Pittsburgh.  My friend 
Christina also wants to go, but we don't have a ride.  If anyone would 
be so kind as to let us hitch a ride with you, we'd be happy to 
reimburse you for the trouble.  I live right at CMU, so we could meet in 
oakland.

peace,
Alex

Hi all
I'm don't mean to be rude but the vibe wasn't there for me..i mean i 
love spike and i live close to the park..i've never made it to a net 
meet but some of the faces were familiar and no one attempted to talk to 
me or introduce themselves...i introduced myself to dan k but he was the 
only one...you all seem to have your little group and i felt akward 
stepping...i realize i could have made the first move towards all of you 
too...but i just didn't feel welcome...flame me or whatever i just 
thought i'd tell ya how i felt...maybe you guys could step back and see 
if you're all as friendly and plur as you may think..
btw..i was the short girl, short dark hair, with a red stripped shirt on 
dancing alot with no shoes on...
until later
little sarah
ps..dan k is cool..it was nice meeting you

Ah, yes.  And my example: MDMA vs. Herbal Ecstasy.

Which one's killed more people from direct use?  Yup, the herbal shit.

Ok I was wrong about caffeine, didn't mean to confuse anyone.  I haven't 
read through all my messages yet, but me and my gf are looking for a 
party to go to this weekend.  I'd be willing to go to cleveland if that 
is the only thing going on this weekend, but like I said we need a ride.
peace,
Alex

>How about Ginsana? or Ginko Biloba?

Aren't all ginseng derivatives only for men? (Or, I should have said, 
"work best for men.") And ginko would fall into the catagory of 'smart 
drugs,' if anything.  It's to up your mental (memory) performance, not 
to getcha jumpin' on the dance floor.

	We're trying to put the finishing touches on the line-up and we're
looking for 1 more house DJ. Are there any suggestions on who would you like
to see? It will probably be for a long (2-3 hour set) in the morning.

	My choice (Mark Farina) will be out of the country, so the field is
wide open... Please e-mail your choices to me.

	Thank you for your input and help.

Hey everyone!  I am again going to compile the list of people going to Lady
Miss Kier this Friday. I dont know if there will be a VIP room again or not--
I have just emailed Rob and asked, so I am waiting for a reply. So all this
list means right now is that we are all planning to be there. Unfortunately,
only half of the people on the last list (for Josh Wink) actually showed up
(as far as my calculations went), so please come if you say you will, and let
people know that you are there!! (Yeah, just come up to us and say hi!) Please
email me as soon as possible if you are going this Friday, and I will put you
on 'the net meet list'. Here's the list so far:

Besides me.... is there anybody else who truly thinks Lady Kier does not
deserve to be called a DJ..... let's face the facts... she SUX as a DJ and
makes a lot of money from it.. just because she was in a GREAT group called
Deee-Lite...
I loved her stuff on Deee-lite.... but does that give her the right to make so
much cash
if she SUX as a DJ......??

I'd rather her be an MC and get paid to sing or MC over another DJ.... then to
hear her trainwreck every dam mix.....

DJ FLex

  kind of carpool or shuttle.  leave a message on our line or email us
  (pbsproductions@hotmail.com) if you're interested in this.
 
  one thing we want to let everyone know: this event is about nothing more
  than having a good time, and grooving to the music!  have phun, but 
  be responsible.  this music and culture are special -  we don't want it
  commodified and sold as a product. please respect the space and
  don't tag. don't bring drugs, weapons or ill attitudes.
  thanks to all the folks who've helped us this far - you're great!

  Thats's a mouthful o' peanutbutter!

  Hope to see you all there.

One more post about this topic and I will shut up...

I think it is disgraceful for people in this city to go out and support
this event in light of the fact that this is the *3rd* time in the past 12
months that Lady Miss Kier is being brought here. (Twice at u4ia and once
again this upcoming week). How long is it going to take to understand that
she is NOT being brought here for her dj'ing skills. She is being brought
here because she will draw a crowd because everyone wants to see the
infamous Deee-lite Diva. She may be a diva, but she is certainly no dj. Do
people even know that she is attempting to spin drum n bass?? Probably
not. And to me, the fact that she is going to draw a bunch of people who
would NEVER turn out for a dnb event makes me really mad because GOOD djs
like 3D only turn out 10 dancers on the floor (as described to me as what
happened at Nocturnal) or clear the floor with complaints! 

This weekend in Columbus, a good dnb lineup is being presented for
only $12 !! If people wanted to hear dnb they'd go there and support
promoters who are honestly trying to bring something much needed in this
area for relatively low cost. But unfortunately, most people are
mesmerized by the celebrity status of a diva who probably has a personal
assistant to hand pick her records. 

Arrrrghhh...like I said, I think it's disgraceful.  If I were going to be
in this part of the country this weekend, I'd make every effort to be
there. I hope that Hardsteppin' goes off really well. 

I guess I just feel responsible to make a plea for people to use their
brains and support people who give a damn about dnb and SKILL. But who
knows, maybe Lady Miss Kier has improved by now, but somehow, I doubt it.

In response to the anti Miss Kier sentiments....

I've seen miss kier the other 2 times.  Both times was a party, great
vibe.  I'm not saying she's a great dj, not even saying she's a good one.
But the crowd is always hyped, and to me that 70% of the good time.

chill.

I also work Saturday morning.  Have no money, no car...I can see miss kier
less than 15mins away from my home.

why am I explaining myself? in response to WAY to much sensless ranting
about something rather silly.  

be happy, dammit :)

<< pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org >>
Put me down for the list.

Also in response to what Kate had to say about Miss Kier.  Yeah, big deal.  So
what if she's been here two times in the past 12 months.  I saw her twice
here, and a few times when I lived out east.  People like her a lot, and she
brings a mad cool vibe which I believe is carried over from her days with
Deee-Lite.  I know that she isn't the best junglist out there, but I(and a lot
of other people) don't mind going and seeing her.
     Also you have to take in to account that there is a party in Cleveland
the next night(Caffeine), that is gonna be $25 at the door.  So, why would I
spend $15-$20 to get in the door, plus other expenses(gas, food, etc.) and
drive the 2+ hours to Columbus when I could drive 20-25 mins and have fun for
a fraction of the cost for me to go to Hardsteppin.  Besides, even though I
enjoy D&B as much as the next person, I just don't have the funds to go to
both.  I know that you probably think I'm trying to slam you, but I'm not.
I'm just saying that no matter what you, I, or anyone else does on friday, it
will still support the scene..

i wanna appologize if my crew and i made anyone feel unwelcome or left out.
Clicks are something that always bothered so knowing that my crew is so
clickish that we seem un appoachable is very disheartening.  PLEASE come talk

Wait . . . you forgot "Support your scene!!"

haha

But anyways, I thought it was slammin last night.  Sine brought the
jazzy, upright bass sounds.  Noel and Abstrakt were pretty similar.  They
both played a very little bit of jazzy stuff, a good bit of really evil
shit, and a whole bunch of futuristic rollers.  I really liked the "Tough
at the Top" remix and the extremely evil stuff.  Amen breaks flying all
over the place with that distorted, grinding bass that makes you want to
go crazy.  I've never enjoyed that kind of stuff before.

Regarding the # of ppl there . . . there seemed to be a good bit to me. 
One of the most misleading things was the amount of people in the bar . .
. if you looked around the normal area, there weren't too many people,
but then if you looked at the bar, it was packed.  Also factoring in the
amount of people that came in for only an hour or so, there were a good
bit of people.

The DJ wasn't on the stage, so it was a lot of fun to dance on it.  Let's
see, some of the activities that went down up there was general dancing,
a fake boxing match between Seth and Frankie, me being the referre, and
my favorite, the jungle congo line!  We must have had about 7 people
dancing around in a line!

ABSOLUT

Alright, I lied about that being my last post ;P

My point is _exactly that which was described by the responses to it. The
fact that Kier "hypes" the crowd is completely ridiculous considering
_why_ and -what_ they are being hyped about. They're not being hyped
because of her skill or because of the music she is playing. It just
points to the stupidity and complacency of a group of people who have no
idea about the technical aspects of the music being pumped through the
speakers (i.e. the mixes are shite). You're paying for a FRONT. 

Why is it that you people are _satisfied- paying ten bucks (that's an
assumption) for a dj who can't mix. You're being _taken advantage of_. I
am not arguing so strongly about this because she's been here 2x already
in the past 12 months, I am arguing like this because she's a crappy dj
and people should know that by now! If a truly wicked dj were brought here
3x in the past 12 months I wouldn't mind as long as I was getting my
money's worth. 

Not only that, but the fact that the music she will be playing is dnb
makes it even worse for reasons that I have already given in my previous
post. 

Please don't think that I am trying to flame anyone or disrespect you guys
who are going. All I want is for people to open their minds and consider
where they are putting their money and for what reasons, as well as
reevaluating _why_ Lady Miss Kier can draw hundreds and other dnb djs who
have good reputations cannot carry a dance floor in this city (and why you
are willing to contribute to this fact). 

However, I am baffled by the responses to "chill", "be happy dammit", and
"take some E and relax". This is a cirumstance which I feel passionately
about. I think that these suggestions (esp. take some E and relax) are
totally insulting and point to the reason why there is so much fucking
complacency in this scene right now. Complacency that has led to
overpriced, overhyped, namefronting, postersized(UGLY) flyered,
nondelivering parties and club events.

Think about it.

mini review:

i was really glad to have school be out so i could make it to steel
city. it's been way too long. anyways, i was liking sine's set a good
bit, esp the afrofunky shit he played @ first. i dont know who came on
first, noel or abstract, but their styles were very similar. the first
guy played more of a dark set, more technical, and the second guy
played mostly far out futuristic rollers. if that's the sound thast's
comin out on dubplate from cali, i'm lookin forward to the actual
releases... all the shit was tight (even if it did get a bit old after
a while, cuz rollers tend to do dat.) ... the first guy pulled a
nice-ass trick... he was playin this evil evil song and let it play
thru to the ambient part right after which you would expect an evil
breakbeat + bass drop, but instead he cut over to an afro-funk record,
which was quite suprising and fun fun fun. i thought that was a great
idea, and if i ever pull any trick like that while performing, you'll
know where the inspiration came from (respect is due where respect is
due).

anyways, big up everybody who i forced to come up to the stage and
those who came willingly or by their own decision.. the party was
definitely goin on up dere :) rsp + pbs in da house ;)

i dunno what to say about the turnout, but that whack-ass freshman
dance party was sure fun @ the beginning!

oh well.. im just killin time @ work so i'm outie.

...frankie g

ps - that was probably the first congo line @ an all jungle event ever
in all of history :)

DUDE-

DON'T YELL!  you are on a mailing list on a computer.  the way you type 
is directly correlated with the way your message is read.  WHEN YOU TYPE 
IN ALL CAPS LIKE THIS YOU ARE YELLING TO EVERYONE WHO READS YOUR 
MESSAGE.  this is annoying to say the least.

how can you know lady miss kier and not know who deee-lite are?  she is 
famous for being their diva.  super dj dimitry and towa tei formed 
dee-lite with lady miss kier back in they day.  they had huge hits like, 
"groove is in the heart."  that whole album is classic.  they have four 
cds out on elektra records.  go buy one today. and please stop yelling.  
spellcheck will help you with things like "shortst skirts"

So what if she has no skills? It's still going to be a better time than
half of the parties I've been to that have featured 'real' djs. Know 
why? Because people are going in expecting to have fun. Some
raves you go to and the dj could be spinning the maddest shit in
the world, if the people there aren't into it, the party sucks. For 
whatever reason, people like Kier and will turn out ready to dance.
That's why I'm going.

judging by the number of responses both public and private to my post
earlier today on kady miss kier, i would like to clarify my point.

i am not the CAPS LOCK-waving, passifier-sucking, net neophyte i played for
you in that post.  (i am equally not a subscriber to the oldschool=cooler
than you mentality, sorry stevieT*). everything in that post was sarcastic,
i am sorry if i did not make that clear enough for some of you.

as a recommendation to those who didn't catch the sarcasm: lurk a little,
match names in the "from:" column and see what other kinds of things a
person says, then don't rule out address spoofing, sarcasm, bad hair days,
and witty friends typing at someone's computer while the person logged in
isn't looking.  Then again, some of the wackos on this list need to
be...nevermind

i would like to point out for everyone listening that the draw of the club
to which kier is coming is not entirely drum&bass music or masterful mixing.
some of you will go there just to meet people, hang out with your friends,
have a few beers, get out of the house, and shake your butt a little.
that's fantastic, i hope you accomplish all of that and have a good time
doing it.  but it is important to go there knowing that you are going to be
paying an inflated cover charge based on the popularity of kier and it is
the popularity of kier with which i have a problem.  kate has already done
an adequate job of dissecting the problems with kier and i won't restate
them for you other than to echo the warning that you are going to hear bad
music and bad mixes and if you are going in search of good music you are
going to the wrong event.  the fact is that finding real quality music and
good parties is a difficult task that requires a proactive search and
willingness to sacrifice and risk.  just because a part is being thrown in
your back yard does not, in my opinion, constitute reason to support the
event.

finally, there is a fate worse than flaming and that is to imply that
another's opinion is altogether invalid.  if you really like kier & her
"skills" (be they marketing or mixing, in your opinion), that is your valid
opinion to which you are entitled.  if i think you are totally misled, i
still think that is your opinion and will respect your freedom to choose and
freedom to form your own opinion apart from mine.  i will not try to get you
to just keep quiet and not say what you think or try to convince you that
the situation is less important than you believe it to be.  hopefully, if i
respect you in this way, you will return that respect by thoughtfully
considering my opinion and weighing it against your own.  even if i think
the issue is a small one, if you feel it is an important one my respect for
you will cause me to consider it just the same.  Of course, respect is a
relationship and a two-way street.  if you choose to not respect me and
consider my opinion invalid, i will likely do just the same to you.  folks
on this list, please show a little respect.  i'm not here to preach PLUR,
but doing this would certainly improve the dialogue that goes on here and
reduce the noise.  remember when every pb-cle-raves post was worth reading?
is every post worth reading now?

Herm, I just picked up the brandy spanking new In Pittsburgh, and
there's an interesting article about the crane and NGL in it... I was
kinda laughing when they stole a quote and a bad joke of mine...
Interesting though, worth a read.

<< Everyones been talking about free parties, we do need some 
 free parties in Cleveland. I think there are parties at nelson's 
 ledges  (geauga county) every now and then.  I personally haven't checked
them out, but heard they were rad. I might check it out sometime soon, try and
get info to
 you people in Cleveland. The cops don't have permits to go there
 so thats a plus. I'll check it out on Friday Night or saturday and
 get back to you guys on here.
 
 has anyone been to these ledges?
  >>

ok, well i've been to the ledges, there about a whole 20 mintues from my
house...but i've never been there for a party...its like a park, there's easy
to follow trails in the woods that take you through the 'ledges', and across
from there, next to the relatively small parking lot, there's a nice large
open area, with a few benches, tables, and such....it looks like a nice place
for parties...i'm not really sure how they set them up there...and i doubt,
its very 'rave' like (dare i say), ..i say that because of the peeps i've seen
and heard talking about it the people, i'm assuming its more like 'hippie
fest' sorta stuff...but i'm not really sure....and if i'm not mistaken there's
one being held over the 4th of july weekend (?)...welp, hope that helps
some.......

forever wandering

I wasnt at spikes party so I cant tell what happened there but Ill tell ya 
that sometimes the pb-cle's do get a little clicish.  Personally, I think 
what is happening is because we are all getting to know each other face to 
face we are 'bonding' together.  As a result, and especially at big 
parties, we dont quite know who to talk to :)  Sometimes we get really bad 
spots for the net meets and most of the people at the spot are not for the 
meet.  I know for me i feel really edgy/wierd about going to up to random 
people and asking them if they are on the list. Partially because, well, 
its geekish :), partially because I dont wanna have to go through the mess 
of explaining it (especially cuz half the time at parties im messed up :) 
and mostly because I am shy at parties ;). I would bet a couple of pb-cle's 
feel the same way but maybe im wrong.

In any case, this is why i think the pb-cle badges are a good idea. Its a 
way of us finding each other without having to know each other's names/d  
escriptions.

Me personally, I will talk with anyone who talks with me but im not a 
conversation starter, i just like to dance at parties.  Thats half the 
reason why im messed up at parties 90% of the time. Im there to move and 
enjoy myself.  Its been said that part of the reason that some people cant 
handle techno (electronica/whatever) or raves is because both are based on 
self centered egotism. YOU have to dance, YOU have to listen, YOU dont have 
anyone to blame or fall back on. There is no 'band' to watch. Sometimes 
there isnt even a 'beat' to listen to or a 'single' set of speakers to 
listen towards.  Its all inside of you and comes from within you.  I mean 
what do you think glowsticking is but a purely 'look at me' style of 
dancing.  Its being uniq and being yourself, everyone's dance style has to 
be different because no one made up a 'rave' dance. (Though you could say a 
lot have evolved, since there are varios commonly excepted names for 
certain 'moves')

Essentially, when I go I go for me.  I go so i can be me entirely and still 
be with fun people.  I still think and care about everyone else but thats 
because thats the way I am.  Walking up to someone to see if they are 
sleeping or feeling sick is part of me being my careing self.  My plur 
comes naturally and i know this. I also know that I have an ego.  And thats 
why i go to raves, to let that ego out and express itself so that i 'use it 
up'. I find raves very theraputic. ;)   I dance because I want to dance but 
I also dance because I know my 'style' gives other's pleasure. Ive been 
told this numerous times by numerous people many of which i dont even know. 
 But I also get a lot of 'ego' points because I know they are watching me. 
 All I want to do in life is make others happy and provide and thats what I 
do. And raves are the best place to do this AND do it my way.  And not get 
'tsk tsk' stares from other people (which I get in real life for the way i 
act).

The point of this story is be yourself, enjoy yourself, and do what you 
feel you want to do. No holds barred. I like to believe that 99% of the 
rave attendees are decent people and dont get a kick out of hurting others. 

As for the list and raves. Well, I can fairly describe myself uniquly 
enough that anyone could notice me: Big guy, sudo mohawk of blackish/brown 
hair.  Glasses with a ducttape middle and a fuckedup black backpack with 
LOTs of ducttape holding the bottom on.  I usually have my red snakelight 
with me so people can spot me in the dark.  (I usually know a bunch of 
random people at parites and so usually end up being a focal point, whether 
its cariing people's stuff, drinks, cameras, flyers etc. or just being the 
guy everyone finds when its getting late and people wanna coordinate rides 
(wish I had a car to offer lifts for people :( )  And if its showing a 
padlock on my neck and a whistle attached to it.

The point of description is find me! :) Im always willing to talk to people 
and willing to try to get anyone anything they need (anything from a drink 
(I usually cary a butt load of gatorade) to where the bathrooms are to 
other)  Ill gladly intrudoce myself, ask you for your name a couple of 
times since I have bad hearing and cant remember names then we can go off 
and introduce each other to other people we know :)

Yeah I do think that some of the people on the list are getting clicish, 
and i know im one of them, but clics are only bad when you arent in them :) 
No reason we cant have a 200person 'clic' :)  In non rave life im part of a 
'clic' of friends that has 30-50 odd people.  (Try jaming that many people 
into a single E-Tower double at CMU (think living in a shoebox) for a 
party, its been done) Point is, I LOVE the idea that we are all getting to 
know each other and going to parties and seeing each other and even doing 
shit outside of parties.  It feels good to go to a party and realize that 
you 'know' a quarter or a half of the attendees, or atleast recognize them 
and know that they are reasonable people.  Comeon, if nothing else we can 
legitmatly win one of those 'throw a party with 100 of your closest 
friends' :)  I cant see much bad and I can see a hell of a lot of good from 
knowing 50 or 100 people at a party enough to know their names and ask them 
for something or help them with something or whatever.  It makes a tight 
scene and a good scene with enough random effect to get new people. I'll 
admit that my outwards apearance tends to ward off people but most everyone 
that even says hi to me knows im not as evil as i look :)  Its a great 
defense mecanism. You know that anyone who talks to you atleast partially 
knows you (and since i dont know half the people i know this is a good 
thing) or is a an outgoing person already and easily talked to.

Now all i gotta do is learn to tie names and faces to emails :)
I love being the center of attention but I as it turns out my personal 
motives are motives that are considered 'good' for the world. There is 
nothing better in the world then realize that you are addicted to helping 
people out. :) And what better way to achieve this then to be the person 
that many people cometo for help. I dont have to feed my addiction by going 
out and finding people to help i just let them come to me. :)  Yeah its 
twisted but hey its me and ive grown to accept it and learn it and better 
myself for it.  Thank you raves for teaching me this. :)

Hmmm...I really don't understand, and I'm honstly trying.  Me telling you
to 'be happy' is insulting?  I'm complacent because of it?? 

I don't quite find the connection, but if there is..slap a label on me.

Fun to preach about, but lets be realistic.  I'd fly all over the world in
the name of good music, but that whole responsibility thing tends to keep
me a bit tied.  And it seems now when I DO get out to have a good time
(which is rare lately) I, and others attending the event, are made into
poster children of careless ravers out to support money hungry
organizations? Ya'll's just a bit ignent. :)

Lately...truely, yes...I belive so.  I wouldn't have given the same anwser
a month ago tho..

Next time if I ignore someone (I was sorta out of it that day, and just 
hung about the turntables, may have eaten some food, but not a lot, and 
sorta played with the silly Car and Truck puzzle)  Oh, yeah, and I 
didn't say hi...BAP ME A GOOD ONE!

Or better when I spin my stupid set, will someone come up to me and say 
"YO! Hey! K.A.L.I. ya 'HO!  Over here ya stupid ((*&^%$# slutty
*&^%$ ya blind or somethin?  GET YOUR NOSE OUTTA DA CHEAT SHEETS YA
BROUGHT!  Can't ya afford 1200's like everyone else?!!"  That'll get
my attention.   :0

Actually I was getting out of depression I wanna die mode and that day 
in the Park did me a wonder!  Thanks Spike depression fit is now over I 
can live again!  (2nd person to bring me back Deadly Buda being the 
first but he doesn't know it.)  Anyway it did me a world of good!

I had fun, talked to Ryan, Todd, Doc Cut-up, met some new folks, did a 
show and tell on how to work the turntables to two nice girls but I 
didn't get their names, 'cause once show and tell was over they took 
off.  It was fun doing the Summer set and Doc Cut-up did some mean and 
nasty evil Jungle set, which was new to me, since I thought he stayed 
only with Hardcore!  So much I knew!  Ryan and Todd did some Massive 
Jungle, and Michael brought it all back to the Old Skool with his set.

Anyway to those of you who I didn't say Hi too, smack me one under the 
West End Bridge okay?  I don't wanna go under the name DJ SNOBBIE BUTT, 
I mean, I THOUGHT I met everyone....

Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry....
DJ K.A.L.I.

yeah, apparently some of us go to events for more than just the music.  

to me it's one of the most important aspects, but definitely not the only one.
i love the nightlife, i love the glamour ... i know there aren't many movie
stars and supermodels living in the pb-cle area, so maybe it's a ny/la thing
... but they definitely do attract ppl.  suckers like me :)

love and rockets

Brian,

not supporting the organizations that only seek to rob you of your cash by
providing you an attractive but wholly unsubstantial lineup is exactly what i
mean.  yeah, that means that you'll miss some parties, yeah that means you'll
make some roadtrips..but again, the search for good music requires sacrifice and
risk (which puts it in a unique class of things alongside love and self
realization, go figure).  so miss a party if it's not going to be exactly what
you want.  i stopped enjoying parties when i was going out all the time like it
was my duty.  then i started to pick and choose the events i went to (which
helped me define exactly why i would go to a party or not) and now i go to a lot
fewer parties than i once did but i have a lot more fun at the events i go to
(like the formation records tour i'm going to have a lot of fun at) and,
incidentally, i have a lot of fun those weekend nights i stay in doing "boring"
stuff :)  

if you go, enjoy yourself and evaluate the event when it's over and let me know
what you think/thought.

Hello all
its me again..i want to thank you all for the positive reponse to my 
perhaps harsh e-mail about spikes party..i may not have choosen the best 
wording then but you all seem very nice..i just wanted you to know that 
i and perhaps others would rather be approached by your whole crew than 
approach you..if you can understand what i'm trying to say.. especially 
in situations such as the small size of spikes party..also the fact that 
i was sober makes me less outgoing..sad but true..anyways don't get me 
wrong i had a good time doing my own thing at spikes but wish things 
would have happened differently..also i've rarely posted to this point 
so i didn't think many of ya would even recognize my name...things will 
be different next time..i hope to meet many of you in the future esp. 
those that responded personally..take 
care sorry for the long babbling..

sincerely,
little sarah

   Ok.  The Bridge Boogie lineup has 2 live PA's, Hip Hop, Hardcore, Happy
Hardcore, Drum & Bass, Techno, and trance.  I think that pretty good variety
(especially for a free party).  

The lineup is as follows:

Live PA's by:
Trout Soup (trouty)
TR Generation (formerly known as Pure)

Featuring DJ's:
Supa C (Tri State DMC Champ)
Beedee
Product 19
7up
Circuit 6 (DJ Absolut and Frankie G.)
Da Mofo (yours truely)
KALI

  That's the lineup.  Hope to see you all there.  Directions will be posted
tomorrow afternoon.

Peace, 
Pat Friend and the Whole O-Boy Crew =)

>You're paying for a FRONT. 
No, I'm paying for a PARTY! Most of us know she can't mix, and that
the MG covers her mixes by hyping the crowd during them, but they are
only a part of the EVENT. Remember the VIP room for Wink? The lights?
The fun crowd?

>Why is it that you people ....
Careful! Ross Perot got in trouble for that one :)

> You're being _taken advantage of....
This is true only if we are as stupid as you think we are.

Don't like the concept of this event? Then don't go.
But don't call us dumb for going.
Check the list Saturday and see how "awful" it was.

puh-leese,

yer lil sarah k!

i don't know you at all, but if i had made it to spike's, you certainly 
could have come up and said i'm lil sara k at hotmail, and i've been 
obliged to respond with a, "whoa, i'm that bastard, art gee, at hotmail.  
no, i'm afraid frankie g, and i aren't twins."  it would have been 
mostly net kids at the party, plus any of spikes crew from the outside, 
but you can't let sobriety get you down, girl.  who cares if anyone 
knows you?  just step to 'em, and say, "hello!"

later,
art gravity

Happy? :)
This is such a high volume list now that I usually just paruse the topics 
and first few lines (cuz my mail reader has a preview option) and only 
reply stuff that really interests me.  Enough craps been floating around 
the past few weeks be glad no one replied :)

<< i stopped enjoying parties when i was going out all the time like it was my
duty.  then i started to pick and choose the events i went to (which helped me
define exactly why i would go to a party or not) and now i go to a lot fewer
parties than i once did but i have a lot more fun at the events i go to and,
incidentally, i have a lot of fun those weekend nights i stay in doing
"boring" stuff :)   >>

Yes, I concur with my colleague on this one :-) I have been under this
philosophy for about 3 and a half years now, and I havent been happier with my
choices. Sure there have been some "bad apples", but I always make my good
time, so they have ALL been worthwhile, no matter what. I just know what to
look for when I want to experience a great party (I'd better, after 8/9 years
of going). And yeah, chalk it up to age (and hopefully maturity), but I LOVE
staying in to do whatever, instead of heading out to the party of the
evening... I would rather stay in and laugh with the TV or play with my cats
than go to some of the events just for the purpose of  "being out". I am more
selective of how I spend my time, and I DO feel that this Friday is a
worthwhile night out. 
1) It supports the Cleveland scene (club OR rave), which needs our help by the
way (they ALL do, really). 
2) It gives us something to do on a FRIDAY night, instead of (if not in
addition to) a Saturday of the weekend. I have been asking for Friday events
to return for a LONG time. Friday events allow us to choose which night to
lose sleep, and thereby those of us who have a hard time with the sleep
deprivation can choose Friday and recooperate for TWO days :-). Plus, a club
night ends much earlier, and is much cheaper.
3) I think Lady Miss Kier is extremely entertaining, WHATEVER she does up
there. She could spin, dance, sing, and I think she is cool as hell. I will
have a good time no matter what. Plus, you good people will be there, so what
more could I ask for?

Okay...:-) Enough from me...
Peas and carrots...

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, i'd like some feedback on this?

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

Jul 10-12               TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL                    Texas

[major far away, but really looks fun!!!!  WOo-HA! lots of camping for me
this summer!!!]

As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.

Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
"Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.

QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of raveyness,
then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

  doorcharge will be $10 - advance locations tba

  the sound throughout the night will have both balance and progression,
  so you can always choose between two styles, or experience a flow of
  sound (dub-dancehall-jungle-hardcore-techno-trance-house).  There will
  definitely be some music you don't hear at every rave - both slow and
  fast tempos - but it will all be good.

  we'll be providing lots of fun stuff in addition to the music & lights,
  including toy prizes, free fruit, face painting, as well as other drinks
  (not alcohol) candy and water ($1) will be for sale.

  parking at the venue is limited, so we advize carpooling with at least 3
  (more is better) people in your vehicle.  we'll also be setting up some
  kind of carpool or shuttle.  leave a message on our line or email us
  (pbsproductions@hotmail.com) if you're interested in this.

  one thing we want to let everyone know: this event is about nothing more
  than having a good time, and grooving to the music!  have phun, but
  be responsible.  this music and culture are special -  we don't want it
  commodified and sold as a product. please respect the space and
  don't tag. don't bring drugs, weapons or ill attitudes.
  thanks to all the folks who've helped us this far - you're great!

  If you have any questions or comments,
   email us: pbsproductions@hotmail.com,
  or leave a message on the infoline 412-734-8334

the way I see it, it goes a little something like this:

early stage (usually reached at age 14-17): "Hi like I just went to this 
one *rave* thing and it was so cool, and there were all these people 
wearing like really _big_ pants and they danced all strange and  stuff."
signs: complete awe for every dj; thinking that anyone at the decks is 
spinning really well; high interest in big name djs (who may or may not 
be good, witness lady miss kier)
sometimes concurrent with much drug usage

scenester stage: "hm, this party was a little off.. the promoters are 
shady, but hopefully there's something better happening next weekend"
often accompanied with a silly amount of naive plur

jaded stage: "this shit is wack. all promoters are just out to rip us 
off. people are just in the scene to do drugs. I'm going to a movie this 
weekend."
at the end of this stage, a groover either leaves the rave scene or 
experiences renewal

renewal: "ok, this isn't so bad... sure some people will try to rip you 
off, but most won't. there are some amazing djs out there. maybe I 
should start to produce/dj/promote"

old school: promoter, dj, producer, live pa, dedicated raver who has 
survived the vicious jaded->renewal->more jaded->more optimism cycle and 
has elected to stay with the scene.

anyway, that was both a joke and a comment on the scene.

Don't forget the pseudo-old school stage:
"I don't care, I'll go to the party force myself to have fun, only drink
and maybe get a new tape.  I understand these people, but they don't
work for a living."
Signs- works 60+ hours a week to pay for rent, car insurence,
girl/boyfriend,..etc, but still finds time to party; only drinks at
parties b/c of possible drug tests; wonders why kids wear so goddamn big
pants; often drives hatchback and deals on the side; never calls "rave"
a "rave"

Basically a representative of the we don't care generation in full efect
at a party. 

signin' off,

   Bridge Boogie will be held under the West End Bridge in Pittsburgh.  The
directions are as follows:

>From Ohio take 76 East into PA.
Get off at the Cranberry Exit and follow the signs to 79 North
Get on 79 North and follow that to 279 north 
follow 279 north to the Chateau Street Exit
take Chateau Street and get in the far right lane
Follow Chateau Street th Beaver Ave.
Get in the far right lane on Beaver Ave.
look on the right hand side for the Cardello Building
once you see it make the first right after the Cardello Building
that small road will take you right under the bridge and that's where we'll
be!!!


Hope these are clear enough and hope everyone shows up.
Any Questions call 412-431-4085 or if you get lost somewhere in Pittsburgh
call 412-973-8554 and I can come and meet you.


Peace,
Pat Friend

If you want to read the inpgh article on the crane, check out the url:

http://www.inpgh.com/current/cover/coverstory-3.html

Yeah it does quote Dan Kelly (but not directly - did they write you about
that dan?).  Its slightly informative about NGL and the whole situation.

Its funny that 'raves' are relevent to inpgh when they fall in relation to
a big business deal, but otherwise the at most a mention or very
surface treatment.  (with again a few exceptions over the years).  

I'm not going to rant on the whole situation, but the fact that they gave
up after an event that drew 1300 people (in pittsburgh no less - thats
got to be one of the top 2-3 draws in pgh ever) says a bit
about their commercial expectations.

- cutup

                  information as possible. This is not the kind of quiet
reading
                  assignment that you like. There's something more
exciting
                  about the situation you're in now. It's as if you're
having to
                  learn how to do the job as you're doing it. There's
not much
    time to ponder all the various possibilities. You're going to have
to choose one
    and act on it immediately. This isn't the way you'd like to do the
job, but you
    should be able to succeed at it anyway. Just be careful and be ready
to put in
    corrections immediately if necessary, too.

 Aries Horoscope for Jun 18, 1998 
                  The Sun is in Gemini and the Moon is in Aries. You are
on a
                  roll. You're highly energetic again today. You're also
very
                  intelligent, even more so than usual. Your mind is
going so fast
                  that it may be difficult for others to keep up. If you
notice
                  them staring at you blankly, that's why. You may, in
fact, be
                  speaking so quickly that they haven't understood a
word you
    were saying. That happens sometimes.

      Cancer Horoscope for Jun 18, 1998 
                  The Sun is in Gemini and the Moon is in Aries. That
Aries
                  Moon usually brings out the fireball in people.
Anybody with
                  Aries in their chart is going to be in a fabulous mood
right
                  now, but they'll also be louder than usual, bouncier
than usual,
                  and maybe even bossier than usual. A little of that
goes a long
                  way with you. You'd just as soon have people leave you
alone
    and let you get the job done. That might not happen now, however. It
looks like
    somebody's in the mood to order you around a little. Try not to snap
back at
    them. Instead, do something to prove again how invaluable you are.
Perform a
    job easily that this other person thinks is difficult.

  Capricorn Horoscope for Jun 18, 1998 
                  The Sun is in Gemini and the Moon is in Aries. Today
your
                  assignment is to take care of somebody at home, or
maybe
                  the house itself, or maybe both. There's something
disruptive
                  going on there, and you can nip it in the bud. It
hasn't quite
                  reached the point of a conflict yet, but there is some
agitation
                  going on. If you take that agitation and put the
energy to good
    use, you could straighten things out and avoid the problem
altogether. Just be
    thinking about what at home doesn't work well, and then when you can
get there,
    put in the correction.

  Gemini Horoscope for Jun 18, 1998 
                  The Sun is in Gemini and the Moon is in Aries. You and
your
                  friends should have a marvelous time, and it's highly
                  recommended. If you're working together on a team
project,
                  you'll get lots accomplished. You have something the
other
                  team members need, and they have something that's
                  impossible for you to get any other way. This is not
going to
    be such a bad deal, but don't procrastinate. These conditions won't
be in effect
    much longer.

 Leo Horoscope for Jun 18, 1998 
                  The Sun is in Gemini and the Moon is in Aries. This is
a
                  marvelous day for you, one of your best for quite a
while.
                  Don't let a moment of it go to waste. Over the next
few days
                  conditions will be changing as the Sun goes into
Cancer. You
                  actually have an advantage now while the Sun is in
Gemini. It
                  not only helps you think more clearly, but it also
tends to
    make others go along with your suggestions. That's certainly an
amazing condition
    to have in effect. If you haven't noticed already, people might do a
little arguing,
    but they generally will mind. That's true again today, so take
advantage of the
    situation. Get your team to do something that you'd never be able to
do by
    yourself. You'll have enthusiasm and good ideas, but that's about
all. Luckily,
    that's about all you'll need.

up your
                  favorite date and head out of town as early as
possible. If you
                  could go today, fabulous. If you have to wait until
tomorrow,
                  then make arrangements to leave early if you can.
Meanwhile,
                  continue to express yourself fully. Even though
somebody
                  doesn't agree with you, that doesn't mean they don't
like you,

Pisces Horoscope for Jun 18, 1998 
                  The Sun is in Gemini and the Moon is in Aries. Looks
like
                  you're in for a shopping expedition. There's been
enough talk.
                  Now it's time to take action. You're going to have to
go and
                  buy the item you need for your home, or it could
actually be
                  the house itself. Or, perhaps you will be moving, and
need to
                  put the money down for the first and last month's
rent. Or
    perhaps you're buying new furniture. At any rate, it looks like
there's money
    involved, and it has to do with your home. Action needs to be taken,
and it's
    going to happen now, so you might as well get out there and do it.

Sagittarius Horoscope for Jun 18, 1998 
                  The Sun is in Gemini and the Moon is in Aries. That
Moon is
                  a real instigator. It pushes you to try things you
would not
                  ordinarily have done. It's not that you wouldn't have
wanted to
                  these things. It's that you wouldn't have thought it
was
                  reasonable. You are remarkably reasonable, even if you
                  occasionally do completely unreasonable things. The
time
    you're most likely to do them is when the Moon is in Aries,
actually. It kind of
    gives you a nudge, and pushes you into action. You're thinking about
the action
    already, but with that extra shove you find yourself out there doing
it. That's quite
    likely to happen today, so watch out!

Moon
                  often stirs you to accomplish more than you would have
                  otherwise. There's a sense of competition in the air,
and
                  actually, you might be involved in some sort of
competitive
                  game. That's not a bad idea. Looks like you'll get a
lot more
                  done that way. In fact, you'll accomplish more today
than
    eight or nine other people combined, if you're not careful. And this
is definitely
    going to lead to an increase in your income.

Taurus Horoscope for Jun 18, 1998 
                  The Sun is in Gemini and the Moon is in Aries. There's
quite a
                  bit of pressure on you today. It looks like somebody
needs
                  something that only you can provide. He or she is
being rather
                  nasty about it, too. Don't snap back. You could cause
injury.
                  Instead, just work as quickly as you can to get this
person's
                  needs met so he or she will go on his or her way.
People will
    tend to speak freely tonight, but it could turn out OK, especially

Virgo Horoscope for Jun 18, 1998 
                  The Sun is in Gemini and the Moon is in Aries. You
probably
                  ought to be careful. When the Moon is in Aries,
bullies tend to
                  kick sand in your face. Not all Aries people are
bullies, of
                  course. Many of them are the heroes who rescue you
from the
                  bullies. In fact, many more of them fit that category.
It's just
                  that the Aries Moon tends to make people more bold and
    assertive, and sometimes they'll assert right into your territory.
Well, don't feel
    overwhelmed or bamboozled. That Moon could make you a little more
    courageous, too, so just stand up to them and tell them to stay on
their own turf.

Hello All...
Well, since we (Downlow) put our necks on the line (and consequently had them
cut off) I thought you might be interested in hearing what we (Rich and Kelly)
thought about the in. pgh. article.
>article said
"Sarah Lolley...plugged into the underground music world"
>we say
We met you 2 months ago and tried to welcome you into the existing scene.  So,
you've been to a party...or two?
>article said
"...local teens and twentysomethings who somehow manage to scrape together
enough money to put on shows at out-of -the-way spots, featuring performers
who mostly have never been within a gazillion miles of a recording contract."
>we say
Richie Hawtin
Heather Heart
John Aquaviva
Adam X
Dieselboy
Deadly Buddah
This was the line-up for Power Rave, Pittsburgh's first big party in 1992.
Recording contract?  Are you kidding?  Not to mention Ani, Doran Chambers,
Frankie Bones, Who, Jason Patrick,  Hardkiss Bros., Jason Jinx, Josh Wink,
James Christian, Monk, Dubtribe, Speedy, Robert da la Gautier, Scott Henry,
Feelgood, Dan, Simply Jeff, Terry Mullan, Mr. Kleen, Nigel Richards, O'Sheen,
Paul Johnson, Carlos, Scott Richmond, Carl K, Slant, Odi, Onionz, Frank Ryde,
Joeski, Danny the Wildchild, David Hollands, Wilhelm K, Jordan, Sleepy
C..........OK, my fingers are cramping
>article said
"Now, I'm the mainstream...I'm the establishment." (Lolley)
"...many of Pittsburgh's young, underground rave promoters don't care much for
the 30-year-old Lewis...He's a businessman first, a music lover second."
>we say
It's an absolute insult to the rave scene to imply that they are at one end
and we are at the other.  I know ravers who are lawyers, cooks, students, drug
dealers, frat boys, poets, strippers, construction workers, nannys, business
owners and musicians.  There are members of the ESTABLISHMENT who frequent
raves.  Respect is given where it is deserved and it is absurd that NGL is
saying that they're not being accepted because of where they work or what they
drive (Dan Kelly, are you shunned from raves because of your little red
Corvette?).  It's because they're clueless and pretending to have a clue.
Period.
>article said
"We flyered the X-Fest," says Lolley.  "There were people going, 'Oh my God,
I've heard these things are crazy!  I'm going to this'  But nobody in the
underground had ever invited them before.  That's because the rave scene lives
in cults.  Each promoter has maybe 50 people they talk to; you get in good
with that person, and they bring their 50 friends to your show."
>we say
This one had even my Mother laughing.  Where do they think ravers come from?
We've flyered malls, under 21 clubs, over 21 clubs, swimming pools and in the
living rooms of friends of friends of friends.  I can tell you that most of
the promoters in Pittsburgh weren't born with 40 inch pant cuffs and glow
sticks behind their ears.  I was jumping up and down to Nine Inch Nails when
Rich forced me to listen to that crazy thumping headache music four years
ago.  There is no secret society here.  Get a clue.
>article said
"Lewis, for his part, can't quite grasp the underground ravers' violently
anti-capitalist perspective"
>we say
Believe me, if anyone was going to be violent it would have happened by now.
And as for "anti capitalist"?  So, are parties free these days?
>article said
"We'll go more mainstream-get the biggest names and spend months and months
promoting each one."  (NGL)
>we say
Pittsburgh has had and will have the biggest names.  Unless you're considering
bringing Janet Jackson in to spin records I don't see how "Rabbit in the Moon"
or "Doc Martin" are going to attract people that have never been exposed to a
rave.  The concept itself will attract them.  Half of a rave promoters job is
to promote "raving".
>article said
"(Lolley) fears for the survival of the rave scene if it stays underground,
where she feels drug use is beginning to hurt the atmosphere of the parties."
>we say
I'd be interested in seeing what goes on in the wee hours within the city's
mainstream night life scenes, for instance strip bars?  Actually, I wouldn't.
And by the way, thanks for the good rave PR.

Peace
Downlow

thought all you guys would enjoy this. i know i did. :-)

by the way, i'd like to apologize for the latest of *my* review of my
graduation party. be assured, it *is* in the works, along with a web
page or two of pictures from the party.

also, dan, i didn't get to see you on tuesday to tell you, but HAPPY
BIRTHDAY!! :)

hope to see everybody at the renegade on friday!!

peace,

--spike

well, here it is. enjoy:

You know you're a raver when...

You break into a full dance in Tower Records when they put on Fat Boy
 Slimover the PA

You have no idea who gave you a ride home last nite, but you hugged em
anyway.

The drug store has No-Doze reserved and waiting for you at the counter.

Your hair color changes with your mood.

An 8 hour drive is a lot shorter when there's a good line-up

You pay the gas station attendant with coins because thats all everyone
who's riding with you had outside of their ticket money.

There is never an empty seat in your car.

You can instantly fall into blissful sleep on a concrete floor
surrounded by
300 people with pounding trance playing overhead.

You start purrring when you hear house music.

Your name your cat Propellorhead.

You pay rent on your own place but still manage to sleep in at least
four
other houses in a week.

 The opening on your pant leg is bigger than your head

 Your body has as many holes as a strainer

 You can dance faster than your parents can drive

 You love "rollin'" but not down hills

 Every volume control on your stereo is set to 10

 You have more tapes than CD's as well as cases for them

 You have to hike up your pants when it rains so they don't get
waterlogged

You spend more time trying to find parties than eating dinner with your
parents

 You'd even blow off your own wedding for a really phatty party with a
good
lineup

You can perfectly understand and have amazing conversations with anyone
under
the age of ten

You know where all the best toy stores are

Ravers get the most mileage out of their shoes... the toes and heels
always
curl up because they're so worn down

You always wish the DJ would spin that OC Transpo track that you keep
hearing
on the bus ride home

You always consider every place you go as a possible location for a
party

You are dancing EVERYWHERE except the main floor

You understand the art of bathroom conversation

You love homemade clothes, cuz you've seen the price tag on a pair of
Lithiums

You always order water when you go out to clubs

You realize that Evian spells naivE backwards (i loved this one!) :-)

You notice that the doors near the Mackenzie King Bridge have an "E" on
the
handle

You don't bother planning to meet your friends ahead of time... your
friends
are always already there

You have a one track mind.... it goes thump thump tweet thump thump
tweet
thump

You constantly point out the trippy visuals in every day life

You helped Adidas through the "lean" years

You always choose "E" on multiple choice questions

You are good at playing "guess what he's on"

You say hi to people you don't know... but see every day on the bus

You know what to do with a dead glowstick

..let me know if you guys liked it!!

No... I knew that Stephen was doing a story... never talked to him
though... I laughed when I saw the quotes of prolly my 2 lamest
statements on the list... I'm glad they didn't directly quote me :)

I agree... I'm not a Business major, but you have to expect that your
first night open, your first night in an industry, if you even come
close to breaking even, that's a good thing. I know it's not uncommon
for a business to go 5 or 10 years before turning a profit... I dunno,
doesn't seem like business genius to me. That's if you trust what was
reported in In PGH... Personally, I think the profit/loss margin of
Digital Genesis had little to do with NGL going out of business... I
would have bet anything remix-a-matosis would have filled the Crane...
we'll never really know now... unless maybe Intergalactic Circus is
going to be held there.

>drive (Dan Kelly, are you shunned from raves because of your little red
>Corvette?).  It's because they're clueless and pretending to have a
clue.


Heh, no, I don't feel shunned at all, quite the opposite... sometimes I
wonder if I went away, had plastic surgery, came back driving a yugo if
it would be the same? Last week in Cleveland kinda made me think yes...
I rode with a friend, got inside, and made a ton of friends I never knew
before... It made me feel all warm inside... I met the nicest little
girl who looks like she's 12 but is really 18... I was like "I'm so
fucking hot, I need to find a fan bad"... she went and asked everyone
where one was, and when she found out there wasn't one, she found this
dude with a pocket fan, and brought him to me... that's PLUR as hell :)

Herm, I dunno if I'm gonna be making it to the Bridge Boogie, I went to
the hospital yesterday, and found out my Kidney Infection from AF2 is
back, and I got either pneumonia or bronchitis to boot :( I took
mon,Tue,wed off from work to move, and was sick the whole time (ARGH).
so I might spend all weekend moving on top of all that, IF I'm well
enough... bleah... life's a bitch.

Supposedly you also recharge them :) Forget where I read this but the 
method was something along the lines of carefully puncturing both ends 
adding a small amount of rubbing alcohol and running wires from a 9volt 
battery in each end and recharging it. They said you could do this one or 
two more times of full use but that the stick turns yellower and yellower 
each time and make sure you dont get the shit on you or if you do to wash 
your hands thourougly cuz it is toxic.

Dont know if I trust that but im sure as shit gunna try just for kicks 
provided I ever actually get my ass some glowsticks.

Im also wondering just 'how' toxic they are. Cuz I thinik it would be cool 
to crack one carefully and do designs on your shoes or something. I wouldnt 
do it on clothing or anything next to the skin but it would be cool to have 
a glowing smiley face on each boot. :)

I remember at a sunshine kids event a while ago someone (I think Matt)
broke one and poured it all over himself . . . . and it was pretty cool
for a while, cause there was glowing shit all over his clothes, but it
quickly stopped glowing and just left a greenish yellow stain on his
clothes.  I don't know if it came off or what.  BTW, don't try to break
them . . . burn them open.

They're not very toxic, in fact the ones labeled "Non-Toxic" on the box,
in fact are Non-Toxic :) hehehe. I think it's hard if not impossible to
find a box or package that's labeled that doesn't say Non-Toxic.

A long time ago before there were public access ISPs in the Burgh, there
was this system called Milliways (and later Chat Thing) it later grew up
into Telerama, but I digress... Anyways, we used to have Get-Togethers
for all the members, and usually someone would make
Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blasters. As everyone knows, A
Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster is a mixed drink that glows in the dark, so
we used the non-toxic variety of glowstix mixed directly into the
drink... It really doesn't change the taste at all. I've also seen bars
selling glow-in-the-dark shots before...

When I was like 14, I was talking on the phone and fidgeting with one and
it cracked in half...so I sprayed it all over my room and stuff...it was
REALLY cool, and it didn't stain my off-white walls or carpet at all! So
for halloween I sprayed it all over my clothes and walked around in the
dark..cool effect...yes, i'm entertained easily. :)

Actually I have saved glow sticks by putting them in the freezer.  
I think it slows down the chemical reaction that produces the light
or something.  As long as they're still glowing when you throw them
in the freezer, they should still work when you warm them up again.
I also thought about throwing it in the microwave just to see what
would happen, but I don't think I want to try it with my microwave.

i'm as excited as everybody else about bridge boogie tonight!!

..but, because the car i would be driving to get there is in the shop,
i'm most likely without a ride. :-(

i know no-one would want to come pick me up at my house because i live
in the middle on no-where (the pbs crew can back me up on this), but
could anyone *possibily* pick me up in monroeville on their way
there?!?! <*please*>

i'll be checking the list all day, plus if anyone wants to call me at
home, my number's 724-727-7614 (ask for spike)

thanks in advance!

peace,

--spike


p.s. i'd be more than happy to pay gas money, money for food, and all
that other good stuff... :-)

I'm hyped about this party tonight, but so far I don't know if I can
get there.  I don't know Pittsburgh that well at all, but if someone
knows, is there a bus route near this party?  Or, if someone near
Oakland could give two grateful kids a ride, that would be sweet.
peace,
Alex

  Find 279  Go to Rt 65 and look for Chateau Street Exit.  Follow that to
Beaver Ave.  Make a right on Beaver Ave.  Look on the right hand side for The
Cardello Building.  Make the right after the Cardello Building and That wil.l
take you under the bridge.  That's where we'll be!!!

If you get lost call 412-431-4085 or 412-973-8554 and I'll get you there.

Peace,
Pat Friend

P.S.  There will be A Special Appearance by John Kelly (Moonshine Records LA).

I've heard of one person drinking the stuff and not dying.  Actually, I
don't even think she got sick.  As for designs, they sell glow paint in
little pens, and I had some on my shoes until they died of natural causes.
I tried putting some in my hair the first night, but it didn't glow and
clumped up my hair.

hey guys...

i've been working all day of this and finally got it done in time to
come to bridge boogie tonight!

the full set of pictures (ten pages, over 30 pictures...) are finally up
on the net at http://members.tripod.com/~outlet_1/g-party.html.

most of you that posted reviews for the party already said everything i
wanted to say. it was GREAT. i couldn't have asked for nicer weather,
nicer people, or a nicer day to have a party...

in particular, i'd like to thank all the DJs that brought equipment and
spun for free... tom, frankie, todd, geoff, and kay... thank you guys
*so much*

trouty, thanks for putting it on the ROM... : )

when you put something like this together and get so many people that
are willing to give so much and ask for nothing in return, it really
makes you happy to have the kind of scene that we have here...

again, thanks again everyone.... i couldn't have asked for anything
more...


peace,


--spike

p.s. see everyone at the renegade tonight!!

Can someone from the Bridge Boogie group please contact Daren to arrange
for the arrival of John Kelly. It is 10 and he wants to spin at 12. We
want someone to pick him up from Oakland area.

Do you ever get this sick feeling in the pit of your stomach?  The kind of
feeling that makes you want to puke until your guts splatter all over the
floor?  I feel this way every time I see a cop's lights flashing towards
my general direction regardless of my general innocence.  I think it's
pretty sad that anyone should feel this way in connection with the police.
I was brought up to believe that they were there to protect the innocent,
to protect the public's rights from criminal wrongdoing.  Why do they make
me feel like a criminal when I'm well within my rights? (please don't
answer this, it's rhetorical)

Tonight, the renegade was busted and busted in the hardest of cores.  It
was stopped in the middle of Trout's set, which from the sounds of it, was
just beginning to totally rock.  Due to previous engagements, we were
unable to arrive earlier so I can't really say how the first bits were,
but there were more people at the party than have probably been at Steel
City Jungle at once in a long time.  

I'm really sad about this, although I'm sure not as sad, or mad, as the
people actually involved in this event.

When exactly did we lose our right to peaceably assemble?
"The Constitution's a good idea in theory..." it's just the practice that
gets us in the end.

Jenifer Foulmood 
who has come out of her hermitage 
to express her sadness and condolences
to anyone who this might have effected
directly.

    just to add a little to what jenifer wrote, yes, the renegade was
busted...

    after searching all day for a ride, andy / aka phatandy from the list very
kindly offered me one... (also thanks to trouty, jeff, and all the other
people who offered me rides...)

    anyway, after leaving around 10:15, we arrived at the west end bridge at
around 11:00 or so. one problem: we were at the *wrong* end of the bridge.
*grin*

    well, appartly somebody from the sound crew had done the same thing
because he was there, very much in a panic, assuring us that the rest of the
crew would be there asap... also, on the other side of the bridge, a small
group of fishermen and what appeared to be white trash were having a little
beer bash of thier own... as we pulled up we asked, 'is this where the bridge
party is?' and they replied, 'hell yeah... come on down.' well we figured that
they didn't exactly look like ravers, but stranger things had happened....

    anyway, after sitting around listening to distorted WDVE coming from the
hick's '78 el dorado for a good half hour, we decided that it *might* be an
idea to check the other side of the bridge...

    thank god we did. coming across the west end brige and down those yellow
stairs to the sight of that renegade in full swing was something that i
*needed* to see.... as we got closer, it was *great* to see that so many
people worked together to put that thing on... the visuals especially were
*very* nice... they looked awesome projected onto the pillars and underside of
the bridge...

    unfortunately, i missed circut 6, dj kali, and doc cutup's sets... (sorry
guys...) but i *did* catch the tail-end of john kelly's set along with the
beginning of trouty's set... pat, thanks for bringing john kelly in.. i really
liked his set.... trouty, i loved the beginning of your set and was just ready
for it to kick it, when..... yep. the fucking cops showed up....

    it figures. tonight must have been the night when no serious crimes were
going on. for real, to just have seven or eight free squad cars, plus a patty
wagon, and a few dozen officiers laying around, the night must have been
pretty slow for pittsburgh's finest... i mean, yes we were on private
property. no, we were *not* hurting anybody. no, we were not causing any
problems, and no, we were not doing anything but having a good time... i just
hope that nobody got into any serious trouble over this. i'd hate to see any
of the people who were just out to give everybody a good time put out over
this... please don't think that we don't appreciate what you're doing, because
WE DO!!

    well, that's it for now... hope everyone ended  up having a good nite
anyway! i'm going to bed...

    peace,

    --spike

p.s. pat, it was nice to get to meet you, even if it was only for a second...
also, shout outs to everybody else i ran into, dan, tom, todd, frankie, kay,
geoff, jamie, john p, john b, and everybody else...

i guess this is farewell, folks.

i'm still searching for a job. after all the resumes, the hunting, and
offers, i still don't have one. and i've done a lot of all of that. no job
means no money. no money means no parties.

it's been great to read all of you every day. some days, it's been the
only thing that's kept me going. but i'll probably lose net access at the
end of the month, because i can't even afford that now. too many bills.
hell, my car is dead in the driveway cuz i can't afford to get it fixed.
(again.)

anyways, it's been real, and i'll miss all of you like hell. keep it real.
if anybody wants to get in touch, you have the email address. if it's
still alive, you can safely assume i am. 

as anim0l would say.. catch ya on the flipside.

peaceorgetdancedon.iloveyouall. :(

i saw dan telling big brother that the sound was his, did you or anyone get
cited, i heard the cops rambling about that sort of thing, but was doing
about the FASTEST tear down ever....  coz i heard a prick cop say lets get
the one with the most gear and get his name.  figured that'd be me, so i
wanted the HELL OUT OF THERE.  yeah i was warming up really, i put my sucky
stuff at the beginning and the fun stuff later on.  i only have enough
material to go about 55 mins or so.....  or material i'd feel comfortable
playing in public.  =)
i did see a lot of familiar faces and met a few new, but i was kinda
fidgety and nervous about playing .... there were way more ppl there than
i'd have expected!  well i hope everyone had fun while it lasted, i was
kinda hoping to hang out and relax all night....   oh well.

    I would like to thank everyone who made it out to Bridge Boogie.  We
estimated 300-400 or so people.  That's more than we could have ever expected.
I've never seen that many people under the bridge at the same time.  It
started out being a perfect night.  I'm just sorry I missed Kali's set because
I had some errands to run. I got there when Circuit 6 was spinning and let me
tell you I was very impressed! after them John Kelley went on and simply
rocked it!  Everyone I talked to was having a great time.  Then it was time
for Trouty.  He was just starting to get things banging when the police came
(sorry trouty).  They were totally ruthless.  They were taking names and info
and told us if they ever catch us there again we would be cited.  No one got
cited last night but they gave us a hell of a warning.  That's ok though cause
we have a new space we're going to try.  I apologise to everyone who's night
got ruined because of the police.  and I'm sorry some people didn't even make
it there before it got broken up.  I would like to thank everyone who helped
with their time, money, and equipment.  Thanks to Dan K for letting us use his
sound an mixer, Thanks to Randy from Electrolyte FX for intelagent lighting.
Thanks to all the dj's and live performers and last but not least thanks to
all that supported us and still support the Pittsburgh underground scene.

Thanks again,
Pat Friend and the whole O-BOY Crew

Being I'm awake and bored out'o'me noggin'....

This was both the most impressive and most disappointing renegade i was
ever at (for a grand total of 15 minutes).  Upon arriving around...1?  i
was in utter shock-mazement at the lovely underwater-styles lighting
grazing yon bridge.  And a good (as tom sez) 150+ kids in that spot!  (i'd
guess more than that!)   My heart felt like a bunny being petted by a
butterfly.  

I spied the troutster, working the nodules of control on the
audio-zombifying machines, and I new all was lovely...or so i thought.  I
spied may nice folks, who i figured i could take my time chatting with
with a lot of morning ahead.  sadly it wasn't to happen.

once a few cop cars pulled up, you could sense right away that kids were
planning to book.  hells if i know why (i can guess).  after a very
garbled an completely not understandable announcement over a loudspeaker
(think the parents on charlie brown or subway announcement speakers),
there was a mass exodus of kids (a good 50% within a minute).  we tried to
ask them what they were announcing, but it was met with a rather brutish
and unintelligent reply.  asking them if there was a complaint was met
with "leave now or leave in the wagon" from a typically violent/irrational
cop.  it was bullshit, but i think it was bullshit noone really wanted to
deal with.

i wish i knew some more details as to why these cops think it was
worthwhile to 'bust' the event under the bridge, but i think it will come
down to a basic difference of philosophy.  i'm sure there were 'illegal'
things going on, but that's not even what they were dealing with.  they
where basically saying 'we have nothing better to do than to stamp out 
ingenuity and spirit and fun'.  if the same stuff was going on inside a
bar there's no way it would have ended.  (thus another fucked up
situation - what care we going to *do* about it)  i think if we had a more
unified defence against such things, they wouldn't have been able to bust
us (maybe i'm missing something about a complaint, etc...)

Yeah, in the end its just a party - nothing to get arrested over - but it
still implies alot about our rights as citizens.  I know i'm as guilty as
many of not knowing where some of the lines are drawn.

Anyways....thanks to pat + o-oboy + all others involved + the wall crew
for a fun 15 mins....for what its worth:  i'll spin or support anything
anytime.

ATTENTION ALL DJS!!!!!!

recently i've become part of a new webcasting start-up called Media Bureau. 
my partner and i have a weekly time slot coming up of 8pm til 12am every 
sunday. we've named it twitch transmissions and it's going to be devoted to 
experimental music of ALL types...

so here's the reason for the post: we need djs. we need ALL KINDS OF 
DJS...preferrably those who are on a more experimental tip. we're not sure 
of the details yet, but i can tell you up front that you probably won't get 
paid. i know that i'm not getting any money for this, so i'm asking for the 
support of the people who make music on these lists. we're looking for dark 
music. regardless of the genre you happen to spin, this is the chance to be 
completely experimental and not have to worry about stopping the 
dancefloor....anyone who spins deathcore should get in touch with me 
IMMEDIATELY. again, we are looking for experimental music. if you're 
interested in being part of one of the most experimental, weekly, live 
webcasts, then get in touch with me...

Media Bureau will start it's first webcast on June 28...check out the site: 
www.mediabureau.com. twitch transmissions should have it's virgin webcast 
within a month....sometime in july, we're hoping....this isn't some pipe 
dream, THIS WILL HAPPEN...so get in touch with us ASAP...

peace

Although I didn't attend last night's riverbank renegade, I've been to a 
good handful or two there (same space) over the last few years.
Only once or twice was it broken up (and peacefully, at that) by the 
police.

A little lesson to learn... if you're planning on throwing a renegade in 
an area which is in plain sight from both the West End Bridge *and* the 
Southside/McKee's Rocks, I'd say it would be advantageous *not* to use 
lights, with the exception of perhaps a small strobe.

It's a renegade.  Minimal=effective, anyhow.  The less you have to see, 
the harder it's going to be to break up.

Moreover, don't expect numbers of 200-300 to show up, and apologize if 
they don't.  Just be happy with whatever you get.  

ok, look outside... it's fucking BEAUTIFUL out there!
i'm going to get a job :)

later everyone

Doh.

I misread one of the posts earlier and thought that they were *hoping* 
for 200-300.  I can't believe that that many people really showed up!

Daaaaaamn!

ok, over and out.

Yeah, I loved the lights, but I have to agree it made us more visible...

I think the cops had a real problem with the number of people there...
I've been to parties in the Irish Center with less attendance, and this
thing was just getting started really... If you look at it from the
5-0's point of view, it's their job to make sure that nothing happens to
any of the buildings / fenced in equipment down there, also to make sure
that no one gets hurt in their district, no fights break out, etc...
with that many people, it's pretty damn hard not to have SOMETHING
happen... I think they would have been cool if they came and like a
dozen people were there. but it was like the entire street was a parking
lot on both sides, people were parking down the street on the other side
of cardello, and walking to the party... there were cars and people
everywhere... I know if it was my job to make sure everything down there
was all safe and secure, I would have been a bit worried :)

We need to get a key to the Crane :)

like?

In a message dated 98-06-20 01:34:59 EDT, you write:

I think that you should definitely own either Funky Desert Breaks 1 and/or 2.
They are really great mixes, and are an essential part of any good collection.

I'm definitely going to Caffeine tonight.  I think that the line-up looks like
a lot of fun and some of my kids from columbus and pittsburgh are coming up
for this party.  From what i've heard about the space for the party and the
after-party, it should be a lot of fun with a lot of extra perks like a free
anti-gravity chamber and give aways from caffeine like records, mixtapes,
stickers, phat pants, t-shirts, etc.  I'm really excited about this party and
was wondering if there's going to be a net meet.  anyone else going and
interested?
much love,
   sharon

So exactly what was the reason the cops gave for busting the party?
If it was on private property, did the owner complain?

The cops told me it was on public property and we are not allowed to have
amplified music on any public property without an amp permit.  I think I was
lied to about the public property thing though.  I believe Cardello owned the
space and we were in fact on private property.  Maybe I'll try to look into it
further.

I wouldn't want one little netmeet determining half my wardrobe.  Especially
if other ppl think we're all together and consequently don't approach us.
And no matter how big your pants are or how many ACs they've got, a t-shirt
in the pocket is uncomfortable and underneath another is an oven.  I'd go
with the forehead tattoo idea, myself. =)

that kinda stuff. Anyways, i'll find out more next week and let you all

Hehe, was going through the archives to see whats already been said and 
asked about
FA4 and noticed that the archives think that Jade's email address 
(jade7337@aol.com)
belongs to "David Schwanke"

I was trying to figure out when the hell i said I was going to FA4 let 
alone with a lot of people and with gear :)

So anyway:
Is anyone going from the pgh area that would be interested in giving me and 
possible a few others a lift?
Did we actually start work on the caravan/tent circle idea?
If there is a slew of 'others' without rides from pgh maybe maybe we might 
just wanna head on and rent a car or something?
Anyone got some extra camping gear they wanna lend me? :) Otherwise ill 
just sleep in the open if i sleep at all.  The last 3day 'party' (actually 
a hacking con) I went to I didnt bother to sleep at cuz my friend misbooked 
our rooms for the hotel so we just stayed at the con and awake for 3 days. 
But then again you dont dance for eight hours straight at cons :)
Anyone know if its a really bad idea to showup planing on paying for a 
ticket there or is there a chance that i could be totally screwed when i 
get there. Cuz Ive already missed the deadlines for preorder and if i cant 
get a ride i cant go :(

Id be interested in being out there for the whole thing but will gladly 
conform to the transportation's schedule :). Im willing as always to donate 
money for the trip help pay for the drivers ticket (ive always thought this 
was a good thing but people never take me up on it :) and if i know in 
advance ill gladly bring 'other stuff' as well :)

Im gunna start asking local people that arent on the list if they want to 
go and maybe get a couple extra cars into the bargain but so many people 
love to go to raves but for any given event when I ask they are like 'next 
time..' sigh.

I sure as shit hope I can go. I guess i just picked the wrong time to drop 
out of the scene for a few weeks but summer classes were catching up to me 
and i gotta pass these damn things.
But im back! Dammit! :) "We gunna kick some ass today, till there just aint 
no more ass to be kicked!"

Sigh. Guess its high time I started planning in advance as to what parties 
im going to. No more waking up friday and seeing whats happening where. 
GODDAMNIT I WANT MY OWN CAR!!! :)

i've noticed a few other screwy things with the indices and such, but there
are no newer versions of hypermail that i know of.  do any unix geeks know
of another archiver thingy?   i've generally overlooked the flaws with it
coz it works 98% or so.....   oh well....  t.

hey i'm back again. i don't know if i will have the days off from work for
family affair, (grrr!) but i should still almost definitely be there. if
you need to contact me call (419.627.2121 x5098) since it's hardly ever i
can get to the library.

does anybody know what the piercing is called if it's on a girl, in the
same place a guiche is on a boy? i just got one and don't know what it is
called (if it has a name).

Ok, I know this isn't on the topic of pb-cle-raves at all, but I think
this is really funny.  For those of you animal activists out there,
you may not want to read this :)

Funny Monkey Tested On

	Captain Bananas, a funny little monkey whose simian shenanigans never
fail to crack up everyone he meets, was stresnuously and repeatedly
tested on at ViviTech Concumer Products Research last week
	The delightful Captian Bananas, a four-year-old rhesus monkey, is a
source of neverending amusement for the people lucky enough to work
with him in ViviTech's Irritability and toxicity Testing Division.
	"I just loke the Captain.  He's always doing something crazy to make
me laugh!"  Effused subcutaeneous/ocular-irritant trauma technician
Sarah Downing.  "Yesterday morning, when he saw me coming, he jumped
around his cage and squeled with glee.  Then he spun around and did a
handstand!  I was laughing so hard, I was barely able to strap him to
a table drill a hole in his skull, insert electrical probes into his
cerebral cortex to monitor pair responses, sew his anus shut, cut his
left eyelid off with shears, sela his tear ducts with a cauterizing
iron, and inject a concentrated mixture of cadmium chlorate into his
exposed eyeball."
	"Aren't you a silly little fellow?  Aren't you?"  Downing said to
Captain Bananas, patting him lovingly but carefully on the head to
avoid dislodging the high-amperage electrodes in his cranium.  "Yes
you are!  Yes you are!"
	Downing said that after yesterday's experiment, designed to measure
the time necessary for cadmium chloride to completely dissolve an
eyeball, Captain Bananas was given "the cutest little eyepatch."
	"Who's a little pirate?  Who's a liddle widdle pirate?" she asked
Captain Bananas as he scratched meekly at the square of cloth sewn
over his now-empty socket.  "You are!  Yes you are! Ahoy Captain!"
	Downing is by no means Captain Bananas' only fan at ViviTech.  "I
never get tired of that crazy little guy.  Every time I see him, he
always puts a smile on my face," said Dwayne Stebbins, a shloroxylene
chemist who has enjoyed plenty of the monkey's hilarious antics during
his study of the long-term effects of stove-cleener ingestion on
primates.  "I remember this one time, we forced 2.7 liters of
flammable lighter-fluid/paint-thinner mixture down his throat--oh, the
look on his face!  A few hours later, he really cracked us up when he
defecated the entire volume of undigested chemicals onto a lit bunsen
burner.  I tell you, you haven't tryly seen 'monkeyshines' until
you've seen liquid flame pour from Captain Bananas' anus."
	Admittedly after years of having his skin shaved off with
experimental razorblades, limbs broken and reborken to test playground
equipment, and mucus membranes injected with new industrial solvents,
Captain Bananas is a bit worse for wear.  But ViviTech spokespersons
say his remaining eye is as bright as ever.
	We've got lots of animals here in the lab, but Captain Bananas is
still everyone's favorite--not just for his bottomless bag of crazy
tricks, but also for his phenomenally high pain thresheld," Downing
said.
	As beloved as he is, though Captain Bananas will soon have to move
on.  "Unfortunately, even an irrepressible critter like The Captain
has only so many tests in him," Downing said.  "So next month, after
Captain Bananas helps us determine how much tub-and-tile spray it
takes to remove a monkey's skin, it's off to Monkey Retirement Camp
for him."
	Officials at ViviTech's Monkey Retirement Camp, a motorcycle-helment
testing range, said they said they are "very much looking forward" to
discovering Captain Bananas' unique sense of humor, as well as his
skull's elastic and tensile limits for themselves.

That's it . . . I could not stop laughing when I was reading this . .
. no matter how sick it is.

Hey hay heigh kids, cats, and donkeys of all ages!

I know you're as excited as me:  The flyers for:

 "Life is But A Dream"

Have touched down in pittsburgh, and the publicity stunts will now begin.

If you have all the 4 preflyer additions: this one will make your
collection complete.  Full color, glossy and oh-so lovely.

Anyway, the real question I have here is for kids in areas outside of
pittsburgh, as well as folks who will be going to any major events that I
won't within a reasonable driving distance of pittsburgh.

If you'd be willing to pass out some flyers, or at least put them in a
visable area, I can send you some in the mail.  I don't have major loot to
mail all over, but if it orchestrates right I want you to get some.

Send me your address and where you'd be putting them, and I'll get back
asap.  

Cool - thanks in advance!!! L:)

They said for a) not having a permit, and b) on public property... I
don't believe it is public property though... I believe it's private
property. Who wants to argue (besides link) when you're facing citations
and possible loss of personal equipment? If I get some spare time I
might try and research the legality of the situation though.

Well, only me and Dan Kelly were the first ones there.  I was supposed 
to spin my set at 10:00 p.m. but being how things were, we and some 
other folks who showed up were waiting around till 10:30 then FINALLY
STUFF!!!

Basically, a sound check is one of those important things to do, but 
because stuff came late, and the mixer no one knew really how to work.
I could hear one turntable but not the other, or if I did get the other 
turntable and hear it I couldn't hear the one I orginally heard in the 
first place.  I really couldn't get set up right, and the speed on the 
second record was wrong.  At home I hear the track THEN worry about the 
speed etc.  I skipped over 1 record 'cause there was no way I would have 
found that track, and it would trained wrecked, so I said screw it, go 
to the next IF I CAN HEAR ANYTHING!

This I thought was a pretty raw deal.  Ok, so it was a Renegade, but be 
at least more pro about the sound ya know?  Not everyone has the exact 
same thing at home or is available to know EVERY mixer out there.  I 
would have asked Dan Kelly how to work it, but I don't think he would 
have been too happy teaching someone about a mixer.  There were things 
that happened before hand and I didn't want to bother him about.  He was 
kinda mad 'cause he was there before anyone else, and waited and waited 
for John to show up, so I fell in love with his Corvette and that 
cheered him up. 

Thankfully I was on for a half hour, which wasn't long, but anything was 
better than dealing with that.  I don't know what I would have done if I 
needed to go on longer.  I really don't see how I could have done it.  
So my party mood was like in an all time low.  I mean what if some 
people really wanted to hear my set and it would have been whack because 
of that?  I mean I would have just disappointed everyone there, and 
looked like a damn fool.  Just saying this was a Renegade doesn't 
matter, but it matters to me and everyone else there.

John tried to help but see that is what you do BEFORE someone goes on. 
It is just a courtesy thing ya know, figure this stuff out first and 
then have the DJ go on.  Even at Stickmans' rave people told you how to 
use a mixer.

Other than that Circuit 6 did a killer set, John Kelly a lot of people 
were into his set, and there was a Computer set up, and that is when the 
cops came and killed it.  Oh well.

I called Projekt Haus and for those of you spinning there, the mixer is 
by Radio Shack, they have a Technics 1200 that goes to +8 but the other 
is a Technics 1700 and watch for this:  it goes up to +6 only.  So if I 
were you dudes, I would put +6 limit on both tables.  That would work a 
lot better.  What if you need a +8 and you have that one tied up and you 
have the +6 only to work on?  May wanna practice this at home.  I know I 
will!

ok, lets think about why cracking glo sticks all the way open is a bad 
idea- 
you know that crunch that you hear when you crack them? that is glass 
breaking. see, they keep the 2 reacting chemicals apart by putting one  
in glass. Also, you might want to be a little careful if you get the 
stuff (the oooey gooey insides, as it were) on you, since it can do bad 
things if you get it in your eyes (either from the chemicals or the 
glass)

There is a new (?) record store right where Deep Records used to be on
Noble & Mayfield in South Euclid. Check the web address: www.0iq.com

I have no been to it yet, although it looks very similar to Deep from the
outside. duh.

	Heya, still around god damn it. ;)

	Not throwing parties much lately, I do design work, I use that

Yeah, I love Coldcut.  Only have one of their albums, but it rocks!  The
first time I heard them was while I was doing my apprenticeship for my FCC
license.  When I was able to do my own show, I played them two or three
times a night.  Which CD of theirs do you have?

K-

thanks for the tip on the projekt haus setup.  I FEEL for you on the BB 
mixer thang, but if i have learned one thing from a dj/soundguy I worked 
with a lot, most mixer malfunctions (no offense intended; you're down 
w/me, K!) result from DJ ignorance.  I have seen experienced sound techs 
interrupt their whole night to deal with mixer trouble, and is usually 
fixed w/the (often embarrassing) flip of a switch.  My point is this:  
too many DJs don't have the elementary understanding of basic sound 
processing equipment required to perform.  I do not mean this as a knock 
too ANY DJ.  This is merely an observation which I am offering to all 
potential selectors for their own benefit.  Learn your sound gear 
jargon, and master the art of whooping a strange mixer's ass!

K, do you have any more info on the RS mixer @ the PH?

This is unofficial, so if I make a mistake, bitch at someone else :)

Thursdays at metropol is now being done by John from House Of Styles...
What I remember from what John told me when I was in an altered state of
mind:

It's OVER 18 NOT OVER 21.... wow, big up to John for that! Apparently
the over 21s who still wish to drink can do so upstairs.

There will be resident DJs on rotation, and a DJ from out of town.

DJ Doug will still be spinning the last hour of the day (Not a bad thing
really, he can kick some Speed Garage with the best of em)

It started last Thursday, prolly 125 people there. (This is all second
hand from a friend, I was sick and couldn't go)

That's about it... Dunno how much of that is accurate, but I thought I'd
post it for all you 18-20 year olds that got nothing to do on
Thursday... You might wanna call Metropol just to be sure and for
pricing... pricing used to be $2 cover on Thursday, but it's prolly more
for under 21...

I'll probably be there this Thursday, so come and check me out :)

job and i wanted to say thanks to all the people that e-mailed me trying to
help me out.  It was much appreciated!!!!!

Anyone have anything whatsoever to say about Caffeine?

Heard from a friend that they still weren't open by midnight and the
sign said that not allowed inside were: water bottles, backpacks,
glowsticks, flyers... and that the prices were $25 for first 200 people
and $30 after that (didn't the flyer say $20?)

I dunno, wanting to hear the dealy on this party.

:) Good thing you didn't ask me cause I have no idea how to work it... I
bought it cause I want to learn how to spin, and I needed a pre-amp for
my system anyhow... I dunno how to use it further than getting it to
accept input from my CD player and piping it to the amp... Also I was
half not there cause I was kinda sick, kinda pissed off cause the sound
pick-up was over 5 hours late (Yes it was supposed to be picked up from
my house at 5, but I ended up taking it to the party and no one showed
up to take responsibility for it till after 10) My date for the night
was supposed to be at 8:30pm and I was gonna come back and catch the
tail end of the party... so much for all that :P

You really should have asked Pat how to work it anyhow, it was his
party... I was just loaning him the EQ... But then again Pat didn't show
up at the party till after your set was over, and John had (thankfully)
gone to get John Kelly from the airport, leaving who knows to run the
party... herm... I also noticed Pat dissapeared when the Cops started
asking who was throwing the party, and seemed like they were deciding
who to cite... at the same time the cops were pointing at me saying
"Herm you look like the oldest, you got the most equipment here"...

I don't think anyone noticed other than the first transition... as far
as I'm concerned, that was the sound check :)

You did fine :)

Dan K

btw, I had nothing to do with the throwing of this party other than
offering pat the use of my eq provided he picked it up from my apt and
dropped it back off...

personally i think they have a small selection, but lucky for me it's heavy
on what i like.   i think they need to order a broader selection.  i dont
do my serious shopping there and really their only saving grace is that
they take plastic.   i do like the candy jars at the register tho ;)

Anyone else besides me noticing this new trend in pricing... wherein
the flyer or infoline states one admittance price, but when you get
to the door it's higher?  The cynic in me looks at the human
psychology factor of all these people going out to these events and
once faced with the jacked door price, say, "what the hey, I'm here
already" and pay it?

The cynic in me also looks at the human psyschology factor of the
greed and shadiness of promoters nowadays...

Those that live by the sword shall die by it.

I was a little annoyed at the price of this party before I even
got there. When I pull up and see the sign "$3 for parking" I was truly 
pissed off. I refused to pay and instead parked on the
street. The security were pretty much assholes paid to guard
the interior doors from people getting into other parts of the
building. They weren't letting people into the restrooms that
were inside, but had porta-johns and were charging $2 for water
and not allowing people to bring in bottles. At the beginning of 
the night, they ordered about 20 boxes of pizza to sell, I don't
think they even got through a single one of them. The dj's
were actually pretty good until about 2 or 3, we couldn't seem to
find anyone who could tell us who they were though. The space
was huge inside, two large rooms (one looked like an indoor hockey
ring). And two smaller rooms that were racquetball courts. There
was also one of those inflatable moon-walk type things that was
pretty damn cool. I saw a couple of people getting sick from what
Jay and his boys were selling them, but there was actually good
E to be had if you looked hard enough.

Overall, if I could do it over again, I would drive to Pittsburgh
or Columbus or wherever something else was. I just felt generally
ripped off. Does anyone know who put this party on? I am never
going to give those people my money again.

Well Spike.........it looks like you did your homework:-)   I was apart of
Snap-Crackle Pop Prod.   We use to throw small partires,....nothing too wild.
It was my brother and I who threw a few things together.  He's now DJ Blur,
and I run a Smart Bar Called......you guessed it,  Cafe 2000.  We use to help
John and Ryan of U.D.G. and Natalie @ Lollipop Possie promote for parties.
There use to be alot of promoters along with alot more parties.   There would
always be at least 2 parties a month, and all the promoters knew each other.
Da Jive Turkeys were the ones who started the Renegade Parties.........Aleph
Productions always made NICE!  flyers and they were apart of a few good
parties too:-)     Did anyone on this list ever go to the parties over on 10th
St.????   The ones abouve that car garage over in the South Side??????  Those
partied were GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

     The line-up there included:
Deadly Buda
1.8.7
Diselboy
X-on    a.k.a Eric Justin
and............DAMN!!!!!!!!!    I can't remember this one guy........who use
to throw the cross fader back and forth, jump all around, and have the
GREATEST acid jazz!!!!  He literally use to mix old rag time songs with quick
house beats.....DAMN!  I wish I could remember him.  OH  Kay was there
also..........lights and all:)   

But to answer your question about the promoters.............
Natalie from Lollipop Possie I think moved to Philly......she does tons of
promoting there
John Dwight from Underground Inc.  Is now the second largest DJ in Israel
Matt from the Sunshine kids ....is supposedly in Canada?
Aleph Prod.  well........Josh just said that is doing some design work.  (I
highly recommend) 
And me...........I'm just a drink slinger in my spare time:-)   I haven't done
anything in awhile but.........maybe I'll do a few parties in the future:-)   

Thanks for making feel old:-)

Old men productions? something like that...

I dunno, it just wouldn't seem like a rave without Glowsticks,
backpacks, and flyers... Herm In my opinion it just wouldn't be a rave.

Yeah, these parties in question were held on 18th Street above Kurt's 
Garage (still there)... Scott (Finger) and I threw a party there back in 
May of '94 called 'Warm Milk'-- Scott, Jedi Mindtrip, Terry Kicks and 
Eric Justin (as X-On-- his first set spun out ever) played that night, 
and we all had an amazing time :)

Kurt's Garage is also where I went to my second party ever (TZ's 
'Driving Current') as well as Flower Power 2000 and Driving Current II..  
There was also an all hip-hop party that went down there that year that 
I went to.

There was also once a party on 10th Street... it was called "Little Good 
Vibe" and Lisa of Turbo-Zen/Cloud 9 fame threw it.  It took place in an 
art studio...one fun little party... i remember someone threw on a swing 
record that night!

I really miss my young, carefree days. ahhhhh memories.

Ahh, come now...  Natalie throws Steel City Jungle every two weeks at 
Laga, right here in Pittsburgh.  She hasn't moved away!   Lollipop Posse 
was her and Scott (Finger), who is also around, but no longer spinning 
out.

That would be fine if you brought yours . . . but me and frankie-g
live about a mile and a half from the projekthouse, so it might just
make sense to use ours.  And a bunch of people have used our mixer
before, and our slipmats are high quality . . . unlike the homemade
felt substitutes used at the renegade.

On a side note, what screen width does everybody use?

That' fucking ridiculous.  In general (not always) when a promoter
doesn't let water bottles in it is simply because they want to make
money selling it themselves.  And no flyers, glowsticks or backpacks
is just ubsurd (sp?).

I had told myself I wasn't going to get into a big bitchfest about
this party, but since you asked.... >;)

> Heard from a friend that they still weren't open by midnight and the

Not only was it 25/30, but they charged $3 for parking, and all
surrounding parking lots were mysteriously blocked by cars...The
"tons of phat caffiene giveaways" seemed to consist of 3-4 T-shirts
they threw out while everybody was waiting for the door to open
around 12:15....Now, I'm not a big sound and light critic, but their
sound and lights were just plain fucking mediocre for a party they
charged 30$ for..The touted 'anti-gravity chamber' that everybody was
for some reason so excited about was just a bouncy castle (dunno what
anybody actually expected...), no puttputt, jungle gyms..the second 2
rooms were each about the size of my closet.  Water was $2 and when I
bought mine I actually asked where I could refill it and was told
there was *no* running water, although I later found a small faucet
outside by the bathrooms..Security was a real bitch too, and they
only let 5 people in at once, which made for a very slow moving
line..I don't think they even had 500 people show up, that place
seemed so empty all night...

So all in all, the party was a huge joke - not even the kind of joke
that you can kind of laugh at, but one of those bitter evil jokes
that really hurts your feelings...I guess I kind of let nocturnal
emissions the weekend before go to my head, I must have forgot which
city I was in

Aside from all that, the music *was* pretty kickin, even though there
was no setlist, and I did run into a couple old friends whom I had a
good time with (Hey Joanna!)...Oh yea, and I picked up Robert de la
Gautier's speed garage tape! I'm likin' garage *alot!*

bitches. this is why presale tix are often the best, since there's not 
much they can do if you've already got a ticket... although I have been 
tricked- buying presales and then going to the party and finding out 
that it's at this club that sucks (which is what happened to me 2 
weekends ago here in seattle...)
I wonder if it's the caffine crew or the local promoters who are to 
blame for this though...

Yea, that review sounds about right.  Rich and I got there around ten and
stayed in the parking lot handing out flyers until 12:30.  Just as many
people were turning around leaving as were staying.  We ended up grabbing
Ova and driving to Columbus ourselves.  I can't understand for the life of
me how people within the scene would attach their names to $2 water and
forced $3 parking.  I can kind of understand that certain rules (although
ridiculous) come with using a commercial space like that but I would have
all of that ironed out way before the party and not use the space if the
rules were offensive to the party-goers.
If all the DJs showed, the line-up was kick-ass.  That makes it all the
sadder.

ok, so here's something I've noticed from being back in seattle- 
promoters comp other promoters when they come to a party to flyer. I 
went out promoting with dj jon lemmon one night and we hit like 3 
parties (well, one was a club) to hand out flyers for his monthly. 
anyway, I thought this was a good thing to get in free, esp. since we 
weren't at any one party for more than 2 hours. why doesn't this happen 
more in pgh?

Here's that thing july 4th in pgh...should be fun if you're into the
harder/messed up moogly techno sounds.  I'm probably gonna pull out the
ultra-nosebleed speedcore for this one. :)  Although warning: it isn't a
'rave'.  Its a manny show.  But the acts sound good to me.  Personally
the only one I've seen is ORI (formerly REVO) and they put on an awesome

no glowsticks?!?!? Let me guess, they were selling them.
Bottled water: yeah making money.
Backpacks? Either so you cant sneak in bottledwater/glowsticks/flyers or
cuz they had their own drug dealers around.
Flyers? That alone would have kept me out no matter the distance. I wouldve 
just slept outside on the ground or in the car or something. There is NO 
reason to not accept flyers unless they were SOO damn greedy they didnt 
even want competition on future dates.  But then again I cant picture many 
people going back to something from these guys.

That' fucking ridiculous.  In general (not always) when a promoter
doesn't let water bottles in it is simply because they want to make
money selling it themselves.  And no flyers, glowsticks or backpacks
is just ubsurd (sp?).

This discussion has been all over the Midwest list about a dozen times,
so I will keep it short. Most of the time when water bottles are not
allowed to be brought in it is the SPACE OWNER who wants to make bank
off us, not the promoter. Many spaces refuse to rent their spaces out if
they don't get a concession agreement in the contract. That's a very
lucrative income for them (obviously). Another reason for not allowing
bottles is to prevent ppl from smuggling alcohol in. I hate to see ppl
blaming promoters for this water problem when most of the time it's out
of their hands. (I can't say about this specific situation, however.)

> is just ubsurd (sp?).

Not absurd, just annoying. 
No flyers = less mess later, also no cross flyering if there are other
events in the same city that night. 
No glowstix = must be the less mess thing again. 
No back packs = less chance of waepons being brought in or illegal
substances. 

Reality.

Ok......here it goes..........

Millennium Co-op (one of ...if not thee first producton/promoting crews in Pgh
headed by none other than Deadly Buddha himself)  ANYHOW!   They threw a party
called Morph 1.  It was an outdoor even and it was literally a "techno
woodstock" for lack of a better term:-)  Tons of people came ........bands
played as well as DJ's.   A good time had by all........how good you ask????
Well.....the clean up crew reported on finding over 1100 used condoms:-)
Everyone was on something.....I mean it was so bad that when one of the bands
played (I think it was a group called "Blind Sight"  They sang and played for
a bit.........and for 20 striaght minutes all the did was laugh in the
microphones and pressed the Nitrous Oxide tanks nozzle near the mike.  So all
you heard was this long, drawn out HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

You know what the worse part is?????????

No one seemed to mind :-)

Back to the story:-)

After the bands played the DJ's came on...    Great sets by all:-)   Except
Jedi Mindtrip (who I was really looking forward for)   He did mucho grande
LSD!!!  I mean everyone there was on something but he was pretty out
there...........

He gets up on stage and starts a record.....kinda starts it that is:-)

He placed the the needle right next to the record so that just the cartiage
(sp) was sitting on the record, not the needle!   just the cartiage........All
you heard was the sound of a needle skipping over and over again......I don't
mean that there was any music begin played.......I mean ALL YOU HEARD was a
tick tick.........tick tick........tick tick..........

But ya know what the worse part is???

He fuckin DUG IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

He pressed his headphones up against his ears!!!!!!!!!!!!!   he started
shouting and jumping up and down to get the crowd HYPE!!!!!!!!   BUT!!!!!!!!
there was absolutely NO music being played...........

Sadly to say..........security had to take him off stage:-(   Me, my brother,
and Jordana went that night.  Jo was the last set to perform......which at
9:00 a.m. the following morning:-)    We saw Mr. Jedi walking around
but........thats the last time I ever saw him:-(    

And thats the story:)

i dunno, morph 1 was lacking i'd have to say.
i didnt really have much fun other than the drive from the fairgrounds to
the farm in a convoy of 15 or so cars on the pa tpk around 90 mph honking
and ranting and throwing shit out our windows!
the bands were booed alot if i recall?  and they cut them way short.
the djs were crammed on 2 systems coz they didnt have the third there or
whatnot.   i dunno. 
but i digress....
there was just so much that went wrong with that event.  aleph threw it if
i recall....

Hey,

One of the greatest moments in music history was captured on video tape...
it is U2 "with or without you" on the Rattle and Hum video.

Just amazing...way better than the studio version.    

I know this isn't techno BUT it is soooo good you really out to check it out!

I wasn't on anything that night... i had a somewhat good time with the 
exception of the sound being turned to a bare minimum around 1:00 or 
2:00 and my friend losing her mind on various substances in the woods 
somehow...

but yes... jedi was mad screwy that night

i can't remember his name for the life of me now, and that makes me feel 
stupid because we were pretty tight back then.

sheeit.

oh well.

later all.

hahaha uhmm no aleph wasn't formed until maybe two years afterwards... 
it was millinneum (deadly buda), aka turbo-zen sans lisa.

i think the party went down pretty well considering that joel lost his 
original two spaces before it went down-- the second being THE MORNING 
OF THE PARTY.

Morph did go off the day as planned, at Hamburger Hill paintball range 
in lovely Big Beaver, Pa.  When Joel lost Washington County fairgrounds 
that morning, he was pretty upset to say the least, and was kicking 
things around in the driveway of the fairgrounds.  A business card  from 
Hamburger Hill caught his eye on the ground, and the rest as they say is 
history.

Sorry to hear you didn't have a very good time at Caffeine.

As for the admission price...there was NO price mentioned on the flyer I had
so I called the info line which said "first250 ppl are $25 and then $30".
Seemed a little steep to me and I had  a wedding reception already that night
so I skipped it.    I would have been pissed if I had to pay to park and
couldn't take my backpack in!

I have to agree on all of these points.  Most spaces that aren't dirty
warehouses or places that don't normally have people in it often REQUIRE that
they do the vending in order to let a promoter use the space.  During the
crazy times before a party when a promoter is going nuts looking for a venue,
vending/concessions and all of the things in question (backpacks, water,
glowsticks) aren't generally a priority.  

one reason not mentioned yet that promoters don't let water in is because
sometimes people bring bottles of ghb to parties apparently.  in detroit on
may 30, someone died because he or she drank from a water bottle that had ghb
in it.  

the only major problem with this, in my opinion, is that sometimes people go
to parties with just enough money to get in, so they don't have money to buy
water from whoever it is that is vending it.  i think it would be very fair,
and something that we may try to do in the future, if promoters actually
handed out water bottles at the door and charged a dollar extra on top of the
ticket price.  or maybe just let in empty containers in venues that had
running water.

WOW ... Caffeine sucked on so many levels..
My worst part of the experience was that a
friend from Detroit area that came down was
robbed at gunpoint.... thrown into a car....
driven down the road a wayz and kicked out.
Damn, I felt this shit had a  sketchy vibe when
we drove in the parking lot. Should have paid
attention to insticts.

Look for a Harthouse compilation CD.  They put out some high quality
acid/trance stuff. Any Hardfloor album would be very good too (they
are out on harthouse).  I just got a CD in the mail for free by DJ
Moda called Acid Factor.  It is very good acid house with some trancey
stuff too.  I don't know if it is out commercially yet, it might be
just a promo/advance copy of the CD, but if you want to contact the
man himself (DJ Moda) at ermoda@aol.com.

It seems to me like they should be though.  Now that you guys pointed
all this stuff out, I can see where the promoters are coming from, but
I think that part of the responsibility of the promoter is to ensure
that these annoyances don't happen.  I think that the promoter should
have a team to clean up the flyers and other mess, search backpacks
for weapons or whatever and check water bottles for substances other
than water (or like suggested, just have running water, and in that
case dump all "water "being brought in out).  It all comes down to
responsibility, and its always the prromoter that needs to be held to
it.  I'm going to blame the promoter if the space owners don't want
certain things, because its going to detract from my enjoyment of it,
regardless of whose fault it is.  The promoters choose the spot and if
they can't choose a good one, then fuck it, that's there decision and
will affect my feelings on attending their parties in the future.

Deal with the set.

I don't think that is the only problem.  Another one is that you have
to pay for water, thus increasing the cost even if you do have the
money.  Just because you have money to spend on water doesn't mean it
is fair for the promoters to make you pay for it.  To me, I see it
like baseball games, concerts, theme parks or any other big money
making eventa. They don't let you bring food or drinks into the event
so that they can rip you off with $6 hot dogs.  Obviously this is an
exagerated version of the water bottle thing, but the principal behind
it is similar.

That was at Paul (Groovemaster)'s apt.  The blond girl is Shana who was one of
the first rave kids in Pittsburgh.  She's still around and is helping us with
Intergalactic Circus.  Anyone remember Chesterfield house?  That's where Rich
(Digital Jesus) recruited all these crazies at the beginning.

A canadian friend of mine sent me this.  It's kind of long, but lately we
don't seem to be seeing too many positive media blurbs on raves, so if
you're feeling cynical you might want to give it a look.  It kind of makes
me want to rave again (if only in Canada) and I'm pretty bitter these
days.

  BY LEAH MCLAREN
   Special to The Globe and Mail
  Toronto
   IN a grungy public washroom at the back of what was once a Masonic
hall,
I am waiting in line. Around me the semi-naked, glitter-coated bodies
of
teen-age boys and girls embrace, massage and feed one another water. No
one complains that there is no toilet paper or hand soap, no doors on
the
stalls. Everyone just nods and smiles. The room is a sea of smiles.
    Even in the bathroom, hard-core techno beats surge up through the
floor
and make my skull buzz in a strange but not unpleasant way. I'm 22 and
I
feel old. I am at my very first*rave.*
    "Feels good, eh?" giggles a voice from behind.
    I turn and face a beaming girl in a sparkly halter top and blue
fun-fur
pants. I realize she is holding a vibrating massage toy to my head.
    "It's great for your high," she says, and opens her skinny arms for
a
hug.
    Revelling in its paradoxes,*rave*culture is as complicated as
postmodern theory and as simple as flower power. Simultaneously
spiritual
and superficial, anti-capitalist yet commercialized,*raves*are safely
desexed environments jammed tight with beautiful, writhing teen-aged
bodies. And despite their underground status,*raves*and*rave*culture
have
emerged as one of the most most powerful youth obsessions of the late
20th
century.
    What began a decade ago as a few renegade parties in abandoned
farmers'
fields is now the most electric intersection of music, fashion and
drugs
since the psychedelic movement of the late 1960s. Toronto*raves*can
attract as many as 4,000 to 5,000 people on a Saturday night. It's all
part of an international*rave*ethos that stretches from Paris to
Peterborough. Think of it this way: If Timothy Leary and Sporty Spice
had
a baby, she would be a raver.
    Alex D. (yes, that's his name) is founder and editor of
Canada's*rave*
bible, Tribe magazine. A slim, mild-mannered man who is no longer in
his
twenties, he has made it his principal occupation to archive the
Canadian
underground party scene. From spontaneously unpromoted beach*raves*in
B.C.
to vibrating crowds in Kitchener, London and Montreal, to monstrous
techno
parties at Toronto's SkyDome, Alex D. has seen it all. A former disco
deejay himself, he says ravers are the natural successors to the disco
cats of the 1970s and the after-hours clubbers of the 1980s. "It was
brought in by a younger, more dancing, fashion, non-drinking-oriented
group," says Mr. D. "A group of people who wanted to go somewhere for
more
than just a dark room and deejays. They wanted lights, they wanted
clothes, they wanted fun, they wanted glow sticks, they wanted a real
event."
    And events are what they got. The first documented*rave*was held in
the
Netherlands in 1987, and since then similar events have gained
widespread
popularity in Britain, Europe and more recently in North America. These
underground dance festivals are usually held in warehouses or muddy
open
fields that can accommodate several thousand young party goers ranging
in
age from 15 to 19 (though some are as young as 12 or as old as 50).
    Most*raves*are advertised through handbills or, more often, by
word-of-
mouth. The location is rarely announced before the day of the event, at
which time ravers call a number printed on a handbill to find out the
mysterious location. At the apointed time, partyers meet at a
designated
intersection to catch a bus that will deliver them to an abandoned farm
or
industrial zone.
    Most people attend*raves*to dance, listen to the music and in many
cases pop a pill or two. Almost without exception, the events are
alcohol-
free, and they last all night. Attendance generally peaks at around 5
in
the morning.
    Alex D. says the Canadian*rave*scene really got rolling about 1993.
In
Canada,*raves*tend to attract a young - predominately teen-aged -
crowd.
Raver kids have endless energy, no apparent curfews and come equipped
with
all the necessary party paraphernalia, including glow sticks, whistles,
candy and Vicks inhalers (for a refreshing menthol hit). The going
esthetic is a cross between Twiggy, Ice-T and Cheer Bear. Boys and
girls
alike wear glow-in-the-dark false eyelashes and giant flared
"phat-pants."
The dance floor is awash in tripped-out kiddy stuff, a giddy swirl of
soothers, hair bobbles and happy-face contact lenses.
    Ravers, like 1960s hippie "freaks," claim to feel ostracized by the
public. They see themselves as a peacefully enlightened, though largely
misunderstood, youth group. And as with the psychedelic crowd, drugs -
mainly ecstasy and crystal meth - are a big part of the scene.
    For anxious parents, this picture probably sounds about as safe as
sending your kids out blindfolded into a mine field. But
Canadian*raves*
tend to be meticulously organized and thronged with security personnel.
*Raves*pose much less risk than, say, a bunch of teen-agers drinking
beer
while driving around in a pick-up truck.
    There's even a counselling organization designed specifically
for*rave-*
related problems.
  Toronto Raver Information Project (TRIP) describes itself as "a safe
raving project by and for ravers." The support project runs a booth at
most Toronto-area events and provides free condoms, drug counselling
and
basic first aid. Equally important, TRIP provides a neutral chill-out
zone
for ravers.
    But face it, where there are kids and drugs, dancing and darkness,
there's going to be trouble. Several drug-related deaths have occurred
in
Britain over the past decade, resulting in strict anti-rave legislation
there. But ravers point out that alcohol causes many more social
problems
than ecstasy. "Raves are a lot safer than going to a frat party,
especially for girls," says Sean, a 19-year-old raver and ecstasy
dealer.
    At a recent Toronto event, a medical staffer says he has supervised
25
*raves*and has never had a serious problem. A security guard
corroborates
this: "They're good kids here," he says without hesitation. "They just
want to dance and have fun. I've worked heavy-metal concerts and this
is
way better. The lack of alcohol tames 'em right down."
    Among serious ravers, drinking is frowned upon as a negative,
unhealthy
depressant. They lean toward the milder, "happy" effects of the illegal
recreational drug known as ecstasy (see box). "E"-using ravers claim it
is
far safer than alcohol, which, when consumed in any significant
quantity,
can cause aggressive or even violent behaviour. Ravers claim ecstasy
gives
a more spiritual, loving high.
    According to the Addiction Research Foundation, there have been no
E-
related deaths reported in Canada. The drug has, however, been known to
cause severe dehydration among ravers who dance to the point of
exhaustion
while under its influence.
    The other predominant*rave*drug, crystal meth, is a pure form of
amphetamine crystal. This snortable, powdered form of speed (the drug
that
was widely blamed for tainting the loving vibes of the 1960s
psychedelic
scene) has a negative reputation among many ravers. Because a crystal
high
is so much stronger than an ecstasy high, crystal has brought a
sinister
element to the glittering lights and friendly fun
of*raves.*Increasingly
these events are also packed with strung-out, skinny adolescents whose
saucer-sized pupils and grinding jaws give them the appearance of near
madness. These are the crystal heads.
    "E provides clarity but crystal makes you edgy and belligerent,"
explains 19-year-old Amy. "It's definitely ruining the spiritual aspect
of
*raves,*but kids buy it because it's a lot cheaper." (A hit of ecstasy
costs $25 to $35, while crystal meth is under $20.)
    "Crystal-heads are condemned," declares Tania, 18. "Another name for
the crystal is bitch."
    These two are part of a growing non-drug-using contingent within the
*rave*scene. Sober or "straight-edge" ravers are unshakable in their
conviction that raving requires the mental clarity of Ghandi combined
with
the physical stamina of Demi Moore. The best way to achieve this all-
natural high is to dance, drink lots of water, rest regularly, and
maybe
treat yourself to a $6 carrot-mango-ginger juice. Many party promoters
are
embracing this healthy trend by setting up organic food bars
at*raves*so
that wilting dancers can choose to revitalize themselves with oat bran
bars instead of amphetamines.
    A dedicated sober raver himself, Alex D. describes this wholesome,
almost puritanical mentality as an essential part of 1990s underground
party culture. "Going to a*rave*is a commitment of 10 hours of your
time.
It's not like a concert where you fork out your $35 bucks for a ticket,
the band plays for an hour and then you go home wondering if you got
your
money's worth. Naturally you're gonna drink a lot of water, you're
gonna
eat fruit, you're gonna rest every so often, you're gonna pace
yourself."
    For Mr. D., sobriety is the key to his profession. At 4:30 in the
morning, with a camera strapped around his neck, he looks as perky as
an
aerobics instructor. "If I drank or did drugs," he laughs, "there's no
way
I could do this job."
    The coffee shop directly across Queen Street West from Toronto's
City
TV is known in party circles as "raver central." Teenagers in baggy
pants
and ball caps suck on soothers and share bags of bulk candy while
trading
tips on the best and biggest upcoming events. I can't get over how nice
these kids are, not just to me, but to everyone, especially one
another.
    Sean, a sweet-natured 19-year-old, insists on buying a round of
lattes
while the table of ravers chat, hug teddy-bears and stick stickers on
one
another's faces. Andrew, 17, absently leafs through a history of the
Protestant Reformation for a school history project.
    Talking to ravers about underground parties is not like talking to
lawyers about golf. For these kids, raving is no hobby, it's a
philosophy,
a kinship, a way of life. When asked to talk about the scene, they
speak
in a lingo that alternately resembles a new-age tract and an episode of
Barney & Friends.
    "Raving is spiritual," says Andrew gravely, his book still open on
his
lap. "Dancing for eight hours to the constant beats of techno produces
a
collective symbiosis, what we call a vibe, that allows ravers to
spiritually melt into each other."
    Little bells are going off all over my brain. The Jungian collective
unconscious! Accessing a deeper, collective spiritual realm through
repetitive mantras and meditative dance. On one level this is ancient
stuff. I can suddenly imagine these ravers on a historical continuum,
their dance ritual linked back to that of the whirling dervishes and
the
Bacchae of Greek mythology.
    But before I can finish my thought, I'm interrupted by more kids,
who
are competing to show off their new stuffed animals, glow sticks and
laser
pointers.
    Ravers, it's hard not to notice, like to play with toys. Their
cultural
esthetic is one of playful innocence, and yet one out of every three
ravers I met claimed to be an ecstasy dealer. This underlines the
central
paradox of*rave*culture: the tension between innocence and experience.
    Most ravers, after all, are not children, they are teenagers -
people
who exist in that painful, liminal stage between naivety and cynicism.
Perhaps that's why*rave*culture is so popular. It offers the best of
both
worlds. All the dangerous fun of grown-up night life in a safe,
familiar,
childhood space. Consequently,*raves*feel a bit like a giant
kindergarten
class trip - on ecstasy.
    As one on-line raver wrote, "Basically,*rave*philosophy is simple:
People are beautiful, capitalism sucks."
    But you'd never know it. Despite its fringe reputation,*raves*are
incredibly expensive. Ticket prices are about $35 and the clothes (like
the drugs) are designer-priced. For most partyers, preparation for
a*rave*
consumes considerable time and money. And ravers, it seems, always have
cash. According to the kids themselves, most ravers rely on part-time
jobs
for party funds, but others resort to less savoury methods of
fundraising.
    "Most ravers who deal E only do it so they can afford to buy the
clothes," Andrew confides. Even as a sober raver, Andrew admits to
having
hocked a few pills from time to time for similar reasons. Now, he says,
he
sews his own phat pants to save money.
    "I'm Hugs," smiles one young man, shaking my hand warmly. "Do you
want
a sticker?" As I pick out a purple happy face, a raver called Amy gives
my
arm a gentle squeeze. "Listen," she says, "You can't forget to talk
about
sharing."
    "Pardon?"
    "Sharing. Ravers share everything, it's very important."
    "Also safety," Sean chips in. "Raves are totally safe environments.
When I go to a party I chuck my bag with my cell phone in the corner
and I
never think twice."
    "And love!" shouts Tania, tottering on six-inch platforms. "Don't
forget about New Love!"
    For a minute the cafe becomes a chorus of
blissed-out*rave*philosophy.
"Caring!" they shout in unison. "Hugging!" "Back-rubs!" "Fun!"
    Despite the criticism that this scene is driven by superficial
fashion
and drug culture, devoted ravers like these maintain there is something
downright deep about their unending quest for bliss. As one committed
partyer put it: "A thousand people dancing together in a confined space
for eight hours has to be spiritual. It's like running a marathon . . .
except it's fun."
  Leah McLaren is a Toronto writer.
                           ** A*rave*glossary **
   Techno: A repetitive, electronic music, between 115 and 160 beats per
minute. Techno, which generally has no vocals, evolved as a minimalist,
sped-up form of the "acid-house" of the late 1980s. Although techno is
the
predominant music at*raves,*there are countless other thriving
sub-genres,
including jungle, drum 'n' bass (which uses deeper bass lines),
ambient,
trance (a slower, "trippier" sound) and darkside (which uses minor keys
to
create a creepy, disturbing sound).
    According to some ravers, the trend of stripped-down "minimalist" or
"hardcore" techno seems to be on its way out, as many deejays attempt
to
devise more varied arrangements.
    Deejays: Ravers are deadly serious about their music. Deejays have a
mystical, god-like status and are regularly compared to shamans or
secular
priests. Working only with vinyl records, a couple of turntables used
simultaneously and a simple sound board,*rave*deejays do all their
"spinning" live rather than taping the music. The deejay's job isn't
just
to play records but to improvise the progression, breaks and loops of
the
techno beats while interpreting the collective "vibe" of the room.
    Vibe: Refers to the "contact high" ravers get from dancing to the
mantra-like repetition of techno for eight solid hours with hundreds
(often thousands) of other people.
    Babies: Protective, affectionate term for ravers new to the scene.
Most
often used to describe ravers between the ages of 12 and 14.
    Crystal heads: Derogatory term for ravers addicted to the
amphetamine
crystal meth.
    New-love: The warm 'n' fuzzy*rave*ethos of sharing, caring and non-
sexual displays of affection - the answer to free love in the AIDS era.
*Raves*are not pickup scenes and there is little or no sexual activity.
Dancers, for instance, do not touch one another.
    Sharing: The constant, friendly exchange of gifts at*raves.*These
include stickers, candy, stuffed animals, massages and mineral water.
    Sketching out: Describes the hostility, anxiety and disorientation
experienced by chronic crystal users.
    Smart drinks: The all-natural amino acid/vitamin juices sold
at*raves.*
Ravers (particularly sober ones) claim the beverages help to replenish
the
neurotransmitters that are depleted by strenuous dancing and lack of
sleep.
                ***Rave*drugs: the ecstasy and the agony **
   Ecstasy is the chemical of choice among ravers who use drugs. Its
street
names include E, X, euphoria and love doves, but its chemical name is
somewhat less poetic. MDM (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which is
produced in underground labs, usually comes in a gelatin capsule or
tablet
form. It is consumed orally in 50-to 200-mg doses.
    Ecstasy produces a feeling of pleasure and euphoria with only mild
intoxication. The high lasts from four to six hours. A stimulant, the
drug
produces a strong sense of energy, confidence and friendliness.
    MDM was developed at the turn of the century as a diet drug. In the
early 1970s, psychotherapists began prescribing it as a supplement to
talk
therapy. But it is only since the late 1980s and early 1990s that E has
gained popularity as a recreational drug.
    The Addiction Research Foundation recommends that individuals who
use
ecstasy at*raves*should wear thin, loose clothing, rest regularly and
drink plenty of water. The negative side effects include paranoia,
depression and exhaustion.
    Although the long-term side effects of E have not been thoroughly
documented, there is some evidence that prolonged use causes permanent
neurological damage in animals.
    The other, more sinister*rave*drug is crystal (also known as meth,
crank, ice or speed). This is a pure form of methamphetamine. Like
other
amphetamines, crystal is a powerful central-nervous-system stimulant
that
produces such psychological effects as increased alertness, energy and
confidence (like ecstasy, only much stronger). Side effects may include
severe exhaustion, irritability and depression. Possible long-term
effects
include rapid or irregular heart rate and toxic psychosis. Overdoses of
the drug can result in death due to heart failure, high fever or burst
blood vessels in the brain.
    The drug is usually snorted in powder form but can also be smoked,
eaten or injected. The effects of crystal last from four to 14 hours.
Crystal heads often suck on large soothers to reduce the tension in
their
jaws, which otherwise causes them to grind their teeth incessantly.

Very lucrative income for the owner, huh?  Well, I guess it's all
relative, but I would hardly call a couple extra hundred dollars *very
lucrative* -- unless of course the owners' other primary source of income
is his paper route.

Reality?  How about smiling?  If we cut out those smiles of the ravers
then they'll be less chance of people getting hurt too.  Hey Robin, you've
probably not been to a Cleveland rave before, but we're accustomed to a
much higher level of tolerant behavior here.  And when a promoter -- even
if he/she is a dupe of the owner -- doesn't allow for the minimum
essentials for a good time, then the party simply ISN'T WORTH ATTENDING.

The Caffeine Tour event last Saturday was the most pathetic display of
militant security I've ever been witness to at a party/rave.  Not only did
the searches involve taking everything out of all your pockets and being
thoroughly frisked everywhere, but there were signs warning all attendees
that closed circuit security cameras were placed throughout the building
to monitor everything.  There were local cops and rent a cops abound. 
Shit, if the party had taken place at the Cleveland Hopkins Airport, there
might have been less to worry about.

For me, a party isn't just about the music, it's also about the vibe.  And
if a promoter makes me feel that Big Brother is around every corner, then
I won't let loose.  And without the freedom for self expression . . . it's
just not a party I want to go to.

I ended up going to U4ia and had a fantastic time.  I love Micro and X
Dream, but if the party is going to be like that -- then I'll be happy to
use the $30 on mixtapes instead.


Sincerely,

Braden

Yeppers.

>Bottled water: yeah making money.

Oh yeah.

>Backpacks? Either so you cant sneak in bottledwater/glowsticks/flyers 
or
>cuz they had their own drug dealers around.

David, this is not only hilarious -- but true!  Geez -- I saw Jay (Come 
on, you all have to know Jay) hanging out with security -- and the other 
family of dealers were sitting behind the T-shirt and mix-tapes sales 
tables the whole night.  This second group of dealers were totally shady 
(worse than regular ones I have to say) because they were selling these 
pills that made all kinds of people puke.  However, they also said that 
they "guaranteed their rolls."  So, when a friend of mine went to bitch 
and try to get her money back, she was then given a free pill that was 
pure MDMA (out of a sack full of these pills).  How come these good 
pills weren't being sold in the first place?  Anyone's guess.


The most horrible, shady, disgusting thing I heard about this party 
(from someone who heard firsthand) was something about a guy who went to 
the parking lot with some other guys to buy a vial of MDMA powder.  
Well, he never quite got his wares, because once he was inside the 
dealer's car he was held at gunpoint while his $1400 was ripped off.  I 
have many, many personal opinions about this incident -- ranging from 
"Don't ever get into someone's car to buy drugs!" to "Why a gun?  
Couldn't the dealer have ripped the kid off just as well by slipping him 
a vial of ground-up aspirin?"

Overall -- great music, but every single other thing sucked hard.

--Amanda

DJ Kid from Scotland is also on this lineup. I have a really wicked tape

about a year and a half (or more) ago. I will *definitely* be at this
party if he is still on the lineup.

thanks for the beautiful article on raves...it's the type of shit i'd make a
point to show to my parents b/c it's so accurate + they really shouldn't be
worried about me when i go to raves.  that this article came from thorough
research and hand on experience only underscores it's significance.  One
thing, though: the author claimed that raves were about $35.  This to me seems
about an upper limit.  Raves can be quite free, or (like Life is But a Dream)
as little as $10, which if you stay for say, five hours, puts it at $2 an hour
(or $4 an hour for five hours at a $20 party).  This is comparable to movie
theatres and while a good movie is a great thing, we'll all admit the rave is
the better deal.  for as much (fun) as can be gotten out of a good one, raves
are among the best deals in town.  Also, since when is spenind mad loot on
gear all that important to a raver?  i for one, even though i could spend $40
on a pair of dope ass jeans if i really wanted to, prefer getting all the
wackiest gear they sell at goodwill, etc., which is at least as good at a
fraction of the price.  And i've never seen one of those juice bar thingees,
although it sounds nice if just another way to take our $ (perhaps in a good
way)...are ravers generally all that anti-capitalist?  my theory (is it
yours/general raver's?) is that the big problem with capitalism is with it
people work too hard to make (too much) money and then forget how to enjoy
spending it.  my goal is 1)fun for me 2)fun for others (in that order) and
money can only help in creating fun, at least when you put it to stuff like
boxes of fruit rollups and pass them out to all around who you feel are just
dying to unlock the fruity goodness that lies within (and believe me, there is
a whole shitload of it)... that just about sums up my thoughts, props to you
if you read this entire brain spill of mine...hey tom, are you happy that i
finally added something to the list?

Yeah,

  I pretty much agree with everything that has been said so far.  The space
was dope, but in my opinion was way too big for the number of kids that
actually showed up and/or hung around.  My friends and I were prety bummed out
about the whole thing.  The parking price, the water situation, and especially
the security.  I thought it was odd, how a lot of the kids were outside
sitting on the hill were told first to come down, and then were told that they
had to go back inside. Eventually my friends and I congregated around the
bathrooms again only to be told that we had been outside for too long(10
mins).  But in that span we saw more than our fair share of kids who seemed to
be suffering from dehydration denied access to the faucet, and told to go back
in, including a person who was wearing an all access pass.  That's what I
thought was the wackest part of the whole evening.  Instead of dancing all
night, my friends and I bitched and sat around eventually leaving around
4:30-5:00, where we met Braden while loitering in the parking lot.(Hey Braden,
it's the Don, the Shaker kid).  I don't know about you guys think , but it
once again seems that the cleveland kids have been ripped off by a crew with a
dope line up, but without much else to make for an enjoyable time.......

last thing i heard on the subject is if you let people bring water

not letting people bring in empty water bottles, tho.

Ummm . . . maybe you haven't noticed, but many ravers are MAD fashion
conscious and go out and spend $70 on a brand new shirt just because
it says "Tommy Hilfiger" REALLY big down the sleeve or something
similar.  The big pants (pretty much the symbol of a raver) cost about
$50 a pair.

***NOTE: this is long, irrelevant, and may depress the more materialistic of
you.  News about me is towards the end, and happyfunravertypestuff is at the
very end.  As for the original article, I have to say "yup" to pretty much
everything, except for neglecting hardcore caffeine addicts such as myself.***

...are ravers generally all that anti-capitalist?  my theory (is it
>yours/general raver's?) is that the big problem with capitalism is with it
>people work too hard to make (too much) money and then forget how to enjoy
>spending it.  

In my endless boredom this summer, I have been pondering this.  Humans have
been around 2 million years, no?  And since we have a pretty diverse gene
pool, you can say that for most of that time, we have had at least the
minimal amount of stuff.  At some point, humans had enough stuff that they
could sit without sleeping or searching for stuff.  During this time, one
human figured out that if you plant some of the stuff in the ground and wait
for the moon to zip around a few times, a lot more stuff pops up.  Now not
only do we have stuff, we have extra stuff.  And thus sprung out the
hallmarks of human civilization: government, literature, the arts,
microwaveable pizza pockets, etc.  

What bothers me is that, thousands of years after the discovery of easy ways
to grow stuff, we still have to work 40 hours per week to get stuff.  40
hours out of a 168 hour week doesn't sound that bad, even 40 out of 112
hours awake isn't horrible.  But the amount of stuff-related tedium adds to
this.  Every time you pick out a tie, pay a bill, download productivity
software, or (and this is one of the most prominent examples) load all of
your stuff into a giant truck to move somewhere, you are doing something
that our ancestors found unnecessary.  Do you imagine that you will be
significantly happier than your ancestors with this stuff?  Even my present
job of standing around and selling antiques wears me down to the point where
I can't make music when I come home anymore.  Nobody is prepared to admit
that we HAVE actually gained something from progress, and that WHAT we have
gained is that it no longer takes 40 hours per week from every person to
make the world go around. And the situation is only going to get worse:
yesterday on TV (another annoying product of our civilization) I saw a
report on a branch within Intel which aids businesses using technologies
which would require Intel's newest chips.  Think about that for a minute.
According to DC, you can bill me about $.09 for that minute, b/c that's all
that a minute of human life is worth.  But anyway, as you see, the
uselessness of certain goods in our economy is becoming so obvious that
companies are paying other companies to make their products "necessary."  

I say no.  I'm never buying another Intel chip.  I'm going to use my present
sound system until it breaks, and then I'm going to hum and tap my foot.
I'm not buying another CD, another couch, another piece of clothing that you
couldn't imagine on a foreign Mechanical Engineering TA, another video game,
or another flashy backpack.  These things do not improve my life.  I am not
opposed to capitalism: I think that it is the most sane system of exchanging
goods and services.  However, just b/c Koopa is the best in Super Mario Kart
doesn't mean that you should race with Koopa for 40 hours per week.  There
are things that I will still pay for: a Tatami mat, food, books, soap,
electricity, water, coffee, etc.  Preserving the mind and body without
exuding a foul and repulsive odor is the sort of goal I have in mind.

I don't know about raves.  In my pre-raver days, I hardly bought anything.
Nothing seemed worth it, and I always assumed that when I grew older, I
would find something that's worth the money.  Then I got to college and
bought everything.  It was $27 raves that first made me decide to come up
with a standard for the expenditure of money.  If I decide that raves are
not worth the cost, I will not go back to my old habits of letting the money
pile up.  I will just not work as much, read my eyes out, and let the
knowledge pile up.  I think there's a much greater potential that I will use
an idea from a book 10 years from now than there is that the $10 I save can
buy anything more than a 20 oz. plastic bottle of caramel-colored carbonated
sugar water.  At least a book feels like an end in itself, even when it is
just a made up story from a guy who has been dead for a very long time.

Well, armed with my new philosophy, I'm going off to Washington College in
Chestertown, MD to teach mathematics to 11 year olds for about 3 weeks.  I
am unsubbing b/c the chances that I can make it out there just dropped even
further than they were when I came back to Lancaster.  When I get back, I
may resub.  Maybe I'll wait until I'm back in school.  Maybe I'm done.
E-mail me if you're bored, want to say goodbye, or have an interesting
philosophy (zen, anarchy, whatever).  As for where to spot me in the future,
check the math journals.  I have given up my musical career on account of
lack of talent.  And playing house producer is a lot less fun than playing
rock star.

>dying to unlock the fruity goodness that lies within (and believe me, there is
>a whole shitload of it)

YEAH!  I mean, I never got these things as a kid, and when I finally got a
box a coupla years ago, I took one out, and was like "geez these things are
small.  what a rip-off" and I crammed it into my mouth and ZING!

I may just go... I am not sure yet, but it should be one of, if not THE, most

why can't more people take the time to look into the scene before they start spreading over exagerated opinions of something they don't understand???  i loved the article.....i'd like to see trouty post this on the hyperreal page if he can do so w/o getting busted for copywrite stuff.....i think this was something that everyone who is even remotely interested in the scene should read.  granted, some of the finer points about capitalizm....fashion....and price could be argued, but overall the article was very well written....tactfully presented....well researched....and over all just plain good stuff.  anyway...i'm done throwing out my 5 cents about the thing.....all that's left to say is keep the beats bumpin' and the bodies moving and the vibe positive (put simply....go out and have fun, damnit)

here) about... um... 1995. yeah, some headz were tryin to be pretty
before then, but that's when the mad fashion bullshit really started
kickin in and every raver started lookin the same (aka the way they do
now). im not claimin mad old skool authority... just strictly my
observationz. someone who's acually old skool might wanna say
something about this topic.

which would pretty much fall under the old skool raver idea of just
lookin however you feel like lookin and being the person you feel like
being, which usually tended to be something other than the norm
(rather than the norm that the scene has created for itself nowadays,
which is kinda sad if you think about it).

The cup is not a cup. The cup is a simbiotic relationship between matter 
and energy. It is not a container but a fullfillment.  While it may appear 
to be half empty or half full it is simply a cup that contains certain 
distinct elements half of which are of one substance and half of which are 
of other but both of which contain both matter and energy for whithout one 
or the other you would have nothing.

<< does anyone have that schedule for the movies on flagstaff?  i missed the
 one tonight [the lost world] want to coordinate a meet? >>

<running to flyer on fridge> i got it i got it!!!  :)  

so yeah tonight i went to flagstaff alone but i made a bunch of friends.  i
just spent an hour walking home barefoot.  :P  it didn't hurt while i was
walking but OW now i know why shoes were invented

sun 6/28 - space jam ... wed 7/1 - gattaca
sun 7/5 - micheal ... wed 7/8 - marvin's room
sun 7/12 - rocket man ... wed 7/15 the fifth element
sun 7/19 - flubber ... wed 7/22 - desperately seeking susan
sun 7/26 - contact ... wed7/29 - tomorrow never dies
sun 8/2 - jungle 2 jungle ... wed 8/5 - crybaby
sun 8/9 - the borrowers ... wed 8/12 - the natural
sun8/16 - the muppets take manhattan ... wed 8/19 - batman and robin
sun8/23 - george of the jungle ... wed 8/26 - men in black

and now that i copied that all we better get sumpm together.  and i sure as
hell expect all you jungle headz to come out for the two movies about jungle
:P

um okay actually i am going to take some initiative here and invite everyone
to our movies, expecially you lovebirds cos it's in the park, in the dark,
under the stars, with a deee-lovely view of oakland.  you can drink and smoke
too, i don't foresee any problems with security, although i suppose i should
have a word with them.  there are never any cops until the movie ends.  then
they start shining flashlights to scare the teenage delinquents into leaving.

flagstaff hill is located in schenley park, between the carnegie-mellon
university campus and phipps conservatory in pittsburgh.  

the movies start at "dusk," which means nineish theze daze.  sunday evening
i'll bring goodies and have some stickerz made for anyone who meets me at the
gazebo at the bottom of the hill.  any latecomers can look for us kidz at the
top of the hill after that, where the rowdies generally hang.

um i know most of you don't know me so feel free to grill me with complaints
or whatever.  it's been a while since i've organized anything so i'm kinda
nervous.  i was just sitting here thinking to myself, i should *do* something
... then <poof> i had an idea ...

oh and i'm not taking responsibility for an after party!  :)

"i might be...please introduce possible applications"

Go here...http://www.fravia.org/index.html

Fravia and his little crew know alot about reverse engineering,  it's a well
done and informative site too:-)

"know of any discussion groups online?
I noticed one a while back, but never subscibed."

Try - - -
    Defcon Chat List - Send a message to Majordomo@fc.net containing the line
"subscribe dc-announce"   I just subscribed to it.....I haven't gotten any
mail yet :(


"As in software? Or? (Technically you can reverse engineer chemicals ;)"

We're talking technically...........reverse engineering is a much cleaner,
more professional way to "hack" (for lack of a better term)  a computer
program.:-)   Alot of the times when you "hack" into something you're just
tearing apart a program.  When you use reverse engineering....you're carefully
taking the program apart and looking at it.  It's like a meat cutter in a
grocery store and a surgen at a hospital.  One is just cutting and tearing
while the other is much more precise.

If anyone would like to talk more about this subject please email me
privately.

Much Thanks
Jason

Jul 10-12               TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL                    Texas

[major far away, but really looks fun!!!!  WOo-HA! lots of camping for me
this summer!!!]

As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.

Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
"Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.

QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of raveyness,
then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

  the sound throughout the night will have both balance and progression,
  so you can always choose between two styles, or experience a flow of
  sound (dub-dancehall-jungle-hardcore-techno-trance-house).  There will
  definitely be some music you don't hear at every rave - both slow and
  fast tempos - but it will all be good.

  we'll be providing lots of fun stuff in addition to the music & lights,
  including toy prizes, free fruit, face painting, as well as other drinks
  (not alcohol) candy and water ($1) will be for sale.

  parking at the venue is limited, so we advize carpooling with at least 3
  (more is better) people in your vehicle.  we'll also be setting up some
  kind of carpool or shuttle.  leave a message on our line or email us
  (pbsproductions@hotmail.com) if you're interested in this.

  one thing we want to let everyone know: this event is about nothing more
  than having a good time, and grooving to the music!  have phun, but
  be responsible.  this music and culture are special -  we don't want it
  commodified and sold as a product. please respect the space and
  don't tag. don't bring drugs, weapons or ill attitudes.
  thanks to all the folks who've helped us this far - you're great!

  If you have any questions or comments,
   email us: pbsproductions@hotmail.com,
  or leave a message on the infoline 412-734-8334

no, that's not true. there is usually a cop parked at the top of the
hill, watching what everyone leaving and coming back is doing. there
are also undercover type guys, one of which followed my two friends
around as they headed back to the woods. 

big brother is watching you.

ok, I love my phattie pants, but yes, they are mad expensive (although  
if you look at the price of "normal" jeans, they really aren't too much 
more...)
however, fashion designers have always been borrowing styles from 
"streetwear" and "clubwear", so usually at some point, peeps in the 
underground start thinking "damn, that hilfiger coat is fly" and buy the 
stuff. also, at some point elements of the underground style will hit 
the mainstream youth. remember when every 15 year old and his little 
sister had a flannel and a nirvana t-shirt? (ok, so I grew up near 
seattle, but still, it was pretty common.) then the kids were wearing 
big skate pants and listening to NOFX? Anyway, more mainstream kids 
started going to parties and wearing what they considered to be "rave" 
fashion, thus making it look more homogeneous. this is not necessarily a 
bad thing though- I remember (back in the day, as it were) wearing 
skirts & short shorts to parties and when I switched to wearing big 
pants & sneaks, it became *so* much more comfortable. (like "hey, I can 
dance for a real long time now!") really, big/baggy/sweat pants + tennis 
shoes seems to be the optimal dancing gear for me.
anyway, at some point, mainstream fashion will pass by the rave scene 
and people will probably start wearing more eclectic clothes.
E 

(hey, all those years spent reading fashion mags has finally paid off... 
;)

Damn!!!!!!!!

The night I played there they had a crowd of about 1000 on a Sunday night.
I would have loved to have played there on gay pride weekend, that would
have been a fun night.

I just called the info line for this event.  I'd like to say that I'm
pretty impressed and definitely plan to attend.  Here's why:

1) Although there aren't any huge names per se, there is a wide range of
musical styles represented: acid trance, techno, speed garage, break beats
and house.

2) It's on a Friday and Fridays are weak nights in Cleveland (except when
Rob does something at Trilogy).  If they had tried this on a Saturday, it
would have been a mistake.  Saturdays are party nights and this line up
couldn't compete against a rave with 2 or 3 national names.  Smart move!

3) On the info line they list the order of the dj's.  I love this idea! 
It allows me to know exactly when to arrive.  Specifically, I'm into acid
trance and techno and these dj's go on first and second, respectively. 
So, I know to arrive at 11:00 instead of my usual time of 1:00ish.  If I
had come at 1:00 and learned that I missed Product 19, I would have been
pissed.  So, listing the order of the dj's ahead of time has definite
benefits as far as I'm concerned.  It also re-assures the attendee that
the named dj's are actually coming.  Viktor from Phyrl does this too. 
It's a great idea and hopefully will become standard procedure for
promoters in the future. 

4) It's only $10.  They do a similar event as a weekly at IQ records in
Erie, PA.  It works really well too.  If this goes off as planned and the
turnout is solid for cRave It!, I hope that this becomes a monthly,
bi-weekly or even a weekly event too.  Friday is an open slot here.

Good luck, guys!

Braden

I think it should too.  Although on the other hand it can also be a
downfall for the promoters if used wrong.  If the line-up is listed
and does not have acts of interest in the first hours of the party,
then people will come late, thus setting things off to a sluggish
start.  One of the things that House of Styles has exceeded in is
offering a wide selection of styles, and a good line-up to ensure a
nice flow.  Most of the time they provide advance info on the lin-up
as well.

just my 2 cents

i'm headed on a roadtrip to see old route 66 from chitown to santa monica
for 2-3 weeks and will be leaving monday.
sooooo the gist of it is that i'll need someone to look over the majordomo
for a bit while i'm off, the archives and rom will keep themselves up and
stuff, so thats not much of an issue other than the rom will not be super
current :(

so if anyone has any experience with a majordomo, email me..... (schwanke???)

trouty.

> Jul 10-12               TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL                    Texas
>
> [major far away, but really looks fun!!!!  WOo-HA! lots of camping for me
> this summer!!!]
>
> As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
> Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
> Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
> cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
> fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
> are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
> of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
> treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
> will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
> will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
> drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
> nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
> profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
> in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.
>
> Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
> "Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
> Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
> Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
> ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
> porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
> showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
> of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
> Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
> maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
> Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
> your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
> 12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
> Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
> gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
> is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
> tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.
>
> QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
> touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of raveyness,
> then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
> along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

ATTENTION! PLEASE READ!

    Stealth of the Night has become a victim of substantial mis-information;
this is a party that SHOULD NOT BE MISSED! Please read the information
below; if you hadn't planned to come, I do believe you might want to
reconsider.....

    GENERAL INFORMATION
-Only $10 entry
-Lasts from 9:00PM until you guys decide to go home
-Large, beautiful, and PRIVATE virgin outdoor location.
-Blankets and Chairs welcome; a tent is probably unneeded, though you may
bring one
-Open tables after the DJ sets is a POSSIBILITY; depends on the amount of
people left
-Additional Information and directions the day of the event, call:

FAME RECORDS
(330)434-1354

        I saw it mentioned that the flyering was mostly local; that's due to
the fact that we're trying to keep cost at a bare minimum... so that we can
keep the entrance fee @ a measly $10. I even designed the flyer for my
friend for free; I also ran off the first 400 copies using my own money,
with no desire for reimbursement. This party was thrown from the heart, not
the pocketbook- all we've ever hoped for with this party is to simply break
even. If it so happens that we start making profit, then people start
getting things like free admission and water... and it shouldn't take much
for us to break even.(Although you never know... Murphy's Law seems to
govern MY life, at least....)


IMPORTANT!!! PB-CLE-RAVE-O-MATIC GAVE INCORRECT INFORMATION!!!!

    Unfortunately, the ROM gave a DJ list that is grossly incorrect and
gives the completely wrong impression of our event.  (Nothing against Trout-
I'm sure it's next to impossible, keeping the ROM correct and current)

    The correct- and MUCH richer- DJ listing is given below. However, you
probably haven't heard of most of these DJ's, and there's a very good reason
for that. MIPC, in throwing Stealth of the Night, has the distinct pleasure
of bringing you some of the best new DJ talent Ohio has to offer- not some
losers who just learned to beat match, but DJs who have been practicing for
years, without ever spinning out! Not to mention Akron stalwarts Joe Kidd,
Akshun and Conspiracy, and Zachariah.... or some of the best talent from
overseas (Scotland), down south (Florida) and mid-U.S.A. (Chicago).

    Seeing as you've probably never heard our DJ's spin before, I've added a
short bio to each DJ name in the list below in order to give you a better
idea of the kind of party we are attempting to throw.

***<<<<<DJ LISTING>>>>>***

SPECIAL GUEST DJ's

DJ KID -
spinning Jungle straight from the UK, we were blessed to have him appear for
us... Radio One, Kool FM London... the man from Scotland will
certainly tear shit up! This will be one of only two U.S. appearances; after
Ohio, he goes to Hawaii, then back home to run his nightclub, Manga.
Not only will he be spinning the newest tracks from overseas; he has three
BRAND NEW dubplates from DJ HYPE, specifically for THIS party.
not to mention...

Kid Entropy -
will be MCing during DJ KID's set, as well as spinning his own set of Jungle
beats... from Chicago, he's part of Forte, Cosmic Records and Q-systems...
one not to miss...

DJ Non-Fiction-
is a friend of my buddy who is throwing the party... from Boston and is
part of Forefront and Cartel... spinning Jungle, he's sure to throw down
hard... I've heard his mixtape, and he's awesome!

Damien Harte-
is a good friend of my buddy who is throwing the party. I've heard his
tapes, and he spins some GOOD breaks, with a little bit of everything else
thrown in...


AND NOW THE NEW LOCAL TALENT!
(Read these, and you'll realize how great a party this is going to be...)

DJ Sonic-
is a friend of mine; he was always a good DJ; now he's very good... mad
breaks like you might not have heard them before.

DJ Squirt-
is a very good friend of mine. All he's done for the past year is work and
sit at home spinning... I watched him spin the other day; he
can THROW DOWN, no joke. He knows most of the promoters around here, and
they've been begging him to spin forever... this is the first party he's
agreed to perform at so DON'T miss him...

Joe Kidd-
you probably already know as an Akron mainstay, spinning house music to make
you groove...

DJ Nomad-
is another VERY good friend of mine, he's been spinning for about 2 years
now and has gotten VERY GOOD... we finally convinced him to come
out and spin... he normally spins breaks, but he felt that a house set would
be more fun at this event... and can he spin house..

Zachariah-
you probably know as well, another Akron mainstay... spinning house... I
just saw him spinning the other day; if you haven't seen him for
a while, you probably should. Spinning house...

Rob Riddum-
I'm sure you've heard of... more good Jungle for ya!

Akshun 'n' Conspiracy-
if you've not heard of them, are a Junglist tagteam that can truly THROW
DOWN... not to be missed either...

Last, but certainly not least,
DJ Riddle-
is a friend of mine who's been spinning for a LONG time... he spins jungle,
and he's very good at it. Expect a few little tricks thrown into his set to
spice things up now and then...

    Well, I do hope this clears things up a little; I truly hope you'll
choose to attend our event. I don't usually post on pb-cle-raves, but I've
been reading it for about 2 years now, so I feel like I know you guys
although I'm sure that you probably don't know who I am. Some of you I've
met before; if you're trying to place me, I'm the guy who's usually hanging
out with Casey (hanslgretl@aol.com) when I meet you. Also, if the person who
gave you a Stealth of the Night flyer mentioned that he made it himself,
that was me.

    Yes, that was a Blatant Lead-In to an...

                                                  <<<BLATANT PLUG>>>
    If you have any comments, suggestions, la-de-da, or whatever about the
flyer, it was my first, so I'd love to hear them... you can reach me at
strahan@earthlink.net or on pb-cle-raves...

    In conclusion, (sorry to be so long winded), I stand to gain nothing if
this party goes off; I lose nothing if it flops... I've put no money into it
that I expect a return on- I simply wanted to see this party happen. If you
only knew my friend- he's been stressing SO hard the past 3 weeks trying to
pull this thing together... and now that it's actually come though the way
it was meant to, nobody even seems interested in attending! Well, I'm very
excited at least, and if you were in my shoes, you would understand exactly
why.

    You see, this is a step towards bringing our scene back together;
hopefully this party will touch you in the way that those certain parties
do... the ones that stay with you all your life....

   However, we've got something going for us that outweighs any possible
detriments; we're throwing a party out of Respect and Love; for Fame
Records, for the DJs, for ALL the people who donated their help, and most of
all, for YOU- it's this triumvirate of Promoter, DJ and Audience that allows
our scene to survive, thrive, and grow on its own. Our party may succeed, or
it may fail, but at least it HAPPENED- how many people do you think are out
there who have said, "I'm going to throw a party!"?

    A lot?

  More importantly, how many do you think actually did?




Thanks for paying attention.

PLUR (And I REALLY mean it),
Ron
strahan@earthlink.net

PS- I will also post the flyer as a .jpg file attached to a message. If you
didn't get one, this is for you. If you want, you could even print out
copies and hand them out if you wanted to... ;)

are you lookin' for 12"s or for cds/tapes?  i don't know much about
hard/acid house singles, but I've got a bunch of cds/tapes that are pretty
good.  dj acetate from chicago lays down some lovely acid/tribal house
(can't think of the tape name off hand, although i know
www.pureacidmixtapes.com sells his tapes). some good acid compilations are
'acid warfare' and 'acid resistant' (mixed by db - both are mixed
cds)...neither are particularly new or hard, but both are good and you can
find them at a reasonably good chainstore like Blockbuster music.

I'm at the vast majority of flagstaffs and will meet up w/ you guys if
convinient (we should coordinate it before each night until a general pattern
follows

As for after parties, I know the perfect thing to do.  It IS illegal, but
should be a world of fun.  It's also something i've always wanted to do, so
I'll be happy to coordinate it.  Maybe I'll even take some of the money I
still have because I bought goodwill pants for 5 instead of hillfiger for 50
and buy some fruit roll ups (or some other form of intense fruity goodness) as
extra incentive to thoroughly enjoy yourselves. oh yeah....:

the spot i'm thinking of is a train tunnel which essentially goes underneath
Oakland for quite a good distance.  It is easily accessible from flagstaff and
is (even during daytime, let alone at night) PITCH DARK :-)   I'm thinking  if
we creep down with a powerfull boombox (are you  listening, Frankie?), a
battery powered strobelight (anybody?) and about ten people, we can have a
hell off a good time (especially if a train goes by...don't worry, there's
plenty of room to either side.)

tell me (the list) what you think...perhaps we can make it work this sunday
after space jam.

<< this is a party that SHOULD NOT BE MISSED! >> 

I HAVE to agree... granted that half of these djs are my good friends, but I
didnt even know about this party until the flyers were out, and when I saw the
lineup, I was so proud!!!  They are really good djs and are WELL worth the
admission price. As a matter of fact, they are worth more to see than ten
dollars, in my humble opinion. It has been really cool to see these djs go
from good to better to incredible status, even though they havent spun "out"
yet to a wide public. I urge you to support this effort, as I can personally
guarantee a good time as long as these djs' sets are going on. 

<< You see, this is a step towards bringing our scene back together; hopefully
this party will touch you in the way that those certain parties do... the ones
that stay with you all your life.... However, we've got something going for us
that outweighs any possible detriments; we're throwing a party out of Respect
and Love; for Fame Records, for the DJs, for ALL the people who donated their
help, and most of all, for YOU- it's this triumvirate of Promoter, DJ and
Audience that allows our scene to survive, thrive, and grow on its own. >>

I couldnt have said it better myself. For those of you trying to save money
for Family Affair, its a cheap 10 dollar party, close to Cleveland and
surrounding cities, its an outdoor, summery venue, and a really relaxed
atmosphere. I might even venture to predict that this party will have a better
vibe than any of the other parties I have attended since Family Affair (the
FIRST one). Maybe its because I know and trust the talent? But that, my net
geek friends, is all the reason to go. If you havent yet read the bios that
Ron wrote on the djs on the lineup, please do so below. The lineup is
confirmed, and I dont see what else anyone would rather do this Saturday night
than go to this event!!  Email me if you have any questions about it, or you
know for sure you are going, and I will put you on a net meet list, and from
there we will set up a time and place to congregate and say "hey"!!! Hope to
see many of you there!!! Peas and carrots ;-)  Casey

Unfortunately, the ROM gave a DJ list that is grossly incorrect and gives the
completely wrong impression of our event. The correct- and MUCH richer- DJ
listing is given below. However, you probably haven't heard of most of these
DJ's, and there's a very good reason for that. MIPC, in throwing Stealth of
the Night, has the distinct pleasure of bringing you some of the best new DJ
talent Ohio has to offer- not some losers who just learned to beat match, but
DJs who have been practicing for years, without ever spinning out! Not to
mention Akron stalwarts Joe Kidd, Akshun and Conspiracy, and Zachariah.... or
some of the best talent from overseas (Scotland), down south (Florida) and
mid-U.S.A. (Chicago). Seeing as you've probably never heard our DJ's spin
before, I've added a short bio to each DJ name in the list below in order to
give you a better idea of the kind of party we are attempting to throw.
 
 ***<<<<<DJ LISTING>>>>>***
 
 SPECIAL GUEST DJ's
 
 DJ KID -
 spinning Jungle straight from the UK, we were blessed to have him appear for
 us... Radio One, Kool FM London... the man from Scotland will
 certainly tear shit up! This will be one of only two U.S. appearances; after
 Ohio, he goes to Hawaii, then back home to run his nightclub, Manga.
 Not only will he be spinning the newest tracks from overseas; he has three
 BRAND NEW dubplates from DJ HYPE, specifically for THIS party.
 not to mention...
 
 Kid Entropy -
 will be MCing during DJ KID's set, as well as spinning his own set of Jungle
 beats... from Chicago, he's part of Forte, Cosmic Records and Q-systems...
 one not to miss...
 
 DJ Non-Fiction-
 is a friend of my buddy who is throwing the party... from Boston and is
 part of Forefront and Cartel... spinning Jungle, he's sure to throw down
 hard... I've heard his mixtape, and he's awesome!
 
 Damien Harte-
 is a good friend of my buddy who is throwing the party. I've heard his
 tapes, and he spins some GOOD breaks, with a little bit of everything else
 thrown in...
 
 
 AND NOW THE NEW LOCAL TALENT!
 (Read these, and you'll realize how great a party this is going to be...)
 
 DJ Sonic-
 is a friend of mine; he was always a good DJ; now he's very good... mad
 breaks like you might not have heard them before.
 
 DJ Squirt-
 is a very good friend of mine. All he's done for the past year is work and
 sit at home spinning... I watched him spin the other day; he
 can THROW DOWN, no joke. He knows most of the promoters around here, and
 they've been begging him to spin forever... this is the first party he's
 agreed to perform at so DON'T miss him...
 
 Joe Kidd-
 you probably already know as an Akron mainstay, spinning house music to make
 you groove...
 
 DJ Nomad-
 is another VERY good friend of mine, he's been spinning for about 2 years
 now and has gotten VERY GOOD... we finally convinced him to come
 out and spin... he normally spins breaks, but he felt that a house set would
 be more fun at this event... and can he spin house..
 
 Zachariah-
 you probably know as well, another Akron mainstay... spinning house... I
 just saw him spinning the other day; if you haven't seen him for
 a while, you probably should. Spinning house...
 
 Rob Riddum-
 I'm sure you've heard of... more good Jungle for ya!
 
 Akshun 'n' Conspiracy-
 if you've not heard of them, are a Junglist tagteam that can truly THROW
 DOWN... not to be missed either...
 
 Last, but certainly not least,
 DJ Riddle-
 is a friend of mine who's been spinning for a LONG time... he spins jungle,
 and he's very good at it. Expect a few little tricks thrown into his set to
 spice things up now and then...

i got enough music to satisfy my hard house tooth yesterday.  i went to
hypervinyl and future sounds and picked up some spontaneous things and some
stuff i've been meaning to get.  here, i'll keep you updated on a fellow
ravers' music selections:

<!-----tha segregator-----!>

 The Best of X-Trax -- Volume One
    this is the best CD i own.  i special ordered it from future sounds a
while ago.  i just had to get this after i heard ACCESS by DJ Misjah and Tim
a year ago on WRCT.  and guess what..all of the songs are of ACCESS caliber
(except ACCESS, because it is now officially played-out).  funky drive by
x-connection is the hardest tune i've witnessed. it is wicked, go out and
special order your copy today.
 Psychotrance 3
    this one was recommended by john b., i accepted the purchase b/c it had
flash by green velvet (which isn't the greatest song, but funny).  i
listened to it last night as i walked by dog and was not upset.
 Hardfloor presents -- X-Mix: Jack in the Box
    this is a good comp, yeah.  it is mixed by hardfloor and its function is
to commemorate the acid house era (1988 -- the summer of love, the acid
house era) :( .. sad, that it's gone.
 Carl Cox -- The Sound of Ultimate B.A.S.E.
    john b. recommended this also, has a lot of styles on it, nicely sewn
together.  he played a particular song in the store and i accepted.  i have
no will.
 Harthouse Comp. Chap. 5 -- Bitter Fruits
    just good clean acid/hard house
 DJ 7up -- Soul Power
    i remember ppl talking about this CD in relation to some speedgarage
(which is a derivative of house) so, i said what the darn, and got it.  it
is one of those damned 80min-track CDs, i still like it.  lots of divaness,
but not diva-screech overkill.
 Depeche Mode -- Speak and Spell
    this is where it all began - fuck kraftwerk =], i've been looking for
this for a while.  if cheesy synth-pop is your thing, call me, and i will
throw mulch on various plants (to smother them, of course).
 Dj Frankie Bones -- Factory 101
    i got pissed and turned it off b/c of the one-track mentality this CD
had.  i will listen again later.  another john recommendation.
 trancesylvania 5
    i was hoping for trance8, but had to settle for 5.  really big 2-cd set,
i cannot classify this CD yet.

ha ha, funny thing happened while i was accessing the store [hypervinyl].  i
was up at the counter and i didn't know that john was acutally john b.  so i
was like, do you have any product 19 mixtapes?  ha ha.  and then that 7up CD
was on the counter and i picked it up and said how's this and john pointed
to the guy sitting in chair across the room [dave]...i have no follow-up
witty ending.  john also told me about an event on 5 SEP in one of those
c-cities in ohio.  i was real pissed because i'll be in school -- i may find
a ride down or something.  anyway, vapourspace and DJ Misjah are going to be
the primary music ditributors / headliners.  everyone on the list that gave
me suggestions..i have emailed the DJs for tapes..funkybizz, i will be
sending blanks, thanks.

i'll be at flagstaff this sunday.  we meet at the gazebo at sunset, no?
please confirm.  i'll bring some kool-aid, grape, cold, and hard in bangin'
gallon jugs.

is anyone out there 17 or over and weighs more than 103 lbs, does not have
Creutzfeldht-Jakob Disease and has not been to Zaire in the past year want
to go donate blood?  come on, free cookies and drinks, and no, part of your
soul does not escape when you donate. i do it every three months, because i
am good and used to work there.  anybody want to help coordinate yet another
pb-cle meet?

Andy

well the thing is, the tunnel is in use. trains go thru it (i dont
know how often). while im sure we could all move out of the way in
time it seems like we could find a better place. plus, my boombox is
loud, but not THAT loud, and since the space would be so damn big
there it really wouldnt be all that powerful. also, i've gotta be home
by 12 (cinderella drivers license :), and you usually get a ride home
with me. flagstaff ends @ 11. that gives us ONE hour to get from
flagstaff to the tunnel, setup (shouldnt take too long), have our
afterparty, pack up, and drive home.

Are there any places on the web that you go to buy music? Where I live
there's not much demand for any rave type music, so there isn't much of a
selection in the stores.   Also, I like your taste!  Any more suggestions?
Thanks!

Couple of things to all pb-cle kids:

Remember:  This sunday @ Projecthaus in pittsburgh 2-10pm!
Be there or be some kind of thing with equal sides.

I don't know if there's behind the scene schemes on this one, but I'm all
for bringin' some food type stuffs to share.  I'm plannin' to bring some
cutups-styleee fruitsalad + some grillstuff (although not to feed the
whole lot). Anyone else?  

Things 2:  Thanks to all the people who offered to flyer for me!  I'm
wonderin here: how many of you will be @ projecthaus on sunday?  If so I'm
gonna chince on the postage and give you a stack then.  Otherwise, I'll
drop them in the mail tomarrow morning (spike - i guess you'll have some
when you get back).

3ree.  With the little acid trend, I thought i'd drop a recommendation out
to all you kids who like jungle + acid - the new 12" by Cut-Off on
Position Chrome - "t.b.retrology/loving the alien pt. 3" is amazing...very
trancy stuttered acid drum + bass...slient grooves that build into
rockin' basslines...not really like much else out...

l8s,
 doc cutup

else. my screenname is Sieep x2. the L is really an i. oh this is so silly.
how about we have a game....think of a new screen name for danielle. sounds

Wish I would've thought of this last fall...............=0) franny
____________________________________________________________

Staking out a notoriously rowdy bar for possible D.U.I. violators, a cop
watched from his squad car as a fellow stumbled out the door, tripped on
the curb and tried 45 cars before opening the door to his own and
falling asleep on the front seat.

One by one, the drivers of the other cars drove off. Finally, the sleeper
woke up, started his car and began to leave. The cop pulled him over and
administered a Breathalyzer test. When the results showed a 0.0
blood-alcohol level, the puzzled policeman asked him how that was
possible.

"Easy," was the reply. "Tonight was my turn to be the decoy"

Is this forreal?  a bouncy castle is an anti-gravity chamber?  I
talked to somebody who was planning on going and he thought it was an
anti-gravity chamber . . . as in a simulated space environment . . . .
that's what I would have guessed too.

the "antigravity chamber" is called marketing.  as for the putt putt, just
lying.  my friend jen tore her knee up in that chamber and had to leave
early and ended up at the hospital the next day from jumping too much :/
*sigh*
on a related note:
its much like the "free giveaways" or free _whatever_ to the first 100 ppl.
UPS in akron used to always say free records on their flyers and a kid who
helps them with stuff was doing the door and was given a bag of _shit_
records that riff raffs couldnt _give_ away and was told to give anyone who
asked about the free records at the door one of those.   thats about the
closest to free stuff at the door i've seen other than maybe candy and
flyers and oh EARPLUGS, which is actually a really good idea!  since i
about half the time FORGET MINE!  sigh....
i've had it beaten repeatedly into my head to not expect whats on the
flyer. even by supposed "reputable" promoters.

trouty.

Anyone interested in checking out GREAT music via weekly webcasts should check
out www.a2-inc.com.  Starting wednesday they are going to be broadcasting a
different live set from a different dj every week.  Along with the live set
there will be an interview with the dj of the week.  Kicking off the first
webcast will be none other than myself, Lemon Lyman.  So if you like deep
house and deep techno, check it out this wednesday. I am not sure of the times
yet, but i  will post it as soon as i find out.

Thanks,
Jason

your definition of reputable promoter might just be skewed.  I have been to
parties where the price on the flyer and the price on the voicemail and the
price at the door are all the same.  I have been to events where a big pile
of good candy and funny toys are sitting on the table as you walk in and you
can have whatever you want.  I have been to parties where the water is free
($0).  I have been to events where the promoter's crew or friends are
actually passing out good records.  I've been to parties where the live acts
are tossing freshly pressed, not yet available in stores, records into the
crowd.

if the promoters put bullshit on the flyer they are bullshit promoters, no
excuses.  just because everyone else promises stuff and doesn't deliver does
not lower the standard for what a good and/or reputable promoter is.

people learning to accept getting screwed from many different angles is
*exactly* what brings this scene down.

in many ways, this is a very similar point to the one I was trying to make
last week about lady miss kier.  learn to accept less than exactly what you
want and you'll always get less than exactly what you want.  who knows,
maybe soon you'll come to want what you're being given instead of what you
were originally  looking for.  then, if you get screwed you get exactly what
you deserve and I'm the last person who is going to be willing to listen to
you complain about what you didn't get.

please note that this rant is not about the party in the subject at all, it
is simply a response to the attitudes expressed by the posts concerning this
party and a comment on the bullshit that is so commonplace now in a scene
that once delivered on promises ...

 ... so regularly delivered what was promised that people actually came to
believe that the music and the meaning behind it could change the world.

if it was, you'd have to kick up MAD loots to get into it. i dont even
think NASA has one of those, considering that the astronauts put on
all there nifty space gear and go underwater to practice missions.
this is earth, after all - you just can walk into a room where there
is no gravity. g is a constant (9.8 X 10^420 mpg/s^2 :)

Weren't you the one saying that nobody should go see LMK at Trilogy
because she sucked?(and she did!) Well guess what? The dj's at
caffeine were pretty damn good, but it was still a pretty shitty party
because of the promoters and their choice of a location, security, etc.
I will personally never go to another party thrown by those people
because they ruined what should have been an awesome time. Did
someone say it was Old Man Productions? Bastages!

can anyone tell me what tribal is? i used to think that it was house
with a sorta african tribal drums feel to it, but the only time i've
heard a dj spin tribal was @ get down (shane, i think? he went on
before dieselboy + sphinx TORE THE PLACE TO SHREDS) and it just seemed
like really simple, slowly changing, no-hook, kinda boring house.

ps - there is a record label called tribal records... they might have
what you are lookin for

I might try to do projecthaus on sunday, hopefully both that and flagstaff,
although i can place little priority on flagstaff.  i wrote this about my
expected sun trip to flagstaff before learning of p.haus:

As far as safety (incoming trains), I've walked end to end & back twice w/ no
train... a train would be harder to notice if music, dancing were going on,
though.  But there's no better way to find out for sure than to actually check
it out.  I'll lead a group down after Space Jam this Sunday regardless of a
ride home (I can always PAT bus or walk) assuming a group is following me, and
go alone if not.  Someone might want to consider bringing some pot, because
it's an excellent place to get high b/c the cherry becomes the only light
visible + it's creepy + it's getting high.  Just not so much pot that we
forget which end of the tunnel to exit from :)

I no longer am certain i'll be at flagstaff on sunday, but if i am you're sure
to find me.  

Someone mentioned there are other/better potential renegade spots near
flagstaff (i think)...maybe the golf course, especially later in the night.
Know of any (spots)?  tell me.

NOTE: if you don't want deep intellectual stimulation (not that there's
anything wrong with that), Don't read this!

this was my biggest point in my little letter about possible tunnel parties,
and it has of yet gone unnoticed do i wanted to reiterate for the
"intellectual discussion" massive.  NOTE: i will be using the term 'fruit roll
up'  as synonimous with 'any form of innexpensive (& not necesarily fruity)
goodness' and 'phat pants' for 'any form of expensive self-indulgence'....the
self quote:

Maybe I'll even take some of the money I
still have because I bought goodwill pants for 5 instead of hillfiger for 50
and buy some fruit roll ups (or some other form of intense fruity goodness) as
extra incentive to thoroughly enjoy yourselves

careful observation leads me to believe that people really enjoy being handed
fruit roll ups at random intervals.  it is also quite fun to be the one giving
them, in part because it means your world fills up with smiling faces.  

also: while some people just can't seem to get enough of that fruity goodness,
others are delighted just seeing someone passing it out. (like it's the
thought that counts or something).. this delight originates from the "creative
inspiration" which when put to a good cause results in happiness/good vibes,
etc.

some consider money means nothing.  others contend it means everything.  in
the case of creative inspiration, money is a catalyst (but so is shoplifting
skills)
[a catalyst is something that speeds/facilitates a process, in this case
taking creative inspiration and turning it into happiness/good vibes]

so next time you have some money to spare, keep this in mind, and be sure not
to buy wheat germ, because nobody likes wheat germ

I wonder if all rich people in their fifties are as unhappy as my parents...

Let me conclude with a quote from Albert Einstein, a man who (in my opinion)
definitely would have supported our rave scene:

"How strange is the lot of us mortals!  Each of us is here for a brief
sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses
it.  But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists
for other people- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our
own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to
whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy.  A hundred times every
day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of
other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in
the same measure as I have received and am still receiving.  I am strongly
drawn to a frugal life and am often oppressively aware that I am engrossing an
undue amount of the labor of my fellow-men.  I regard class distinctions as
unjustified and, in the last resort, based on force.  I also believe that a
simple and unassuming life is good for everyone"
-from "the world as i see it", a passage in the book "ideas and opinions"...i
just bought the book; contact me if you want more of his wisdom

note:Einstein believed in democracy as a political system

If you can explain to me what an "unassuming life" is, I'd be happy.

"a man can do what he wants, but not want what he wants"-Schopenhauer (I also
found this in that book)----I am not entirely sure that one can't want what
they want...

Seth

PS- I've been out of school for a few weeks now, and in case you're wondering
I'm venting my excess intellectual energy on you.  i hope you don't mind.

OMP has been around for a while and from what i know has a good reputation
for bringing on good things.  Again, this rant was not directed to this
party in particular (i still don't know what the lineup was), but at the
lack of willingness among those of us who attend parties force promoters to
deliver on what they promise or not to promise it.  That includes quality
talent, that includes free water, that includes party from 9pm - 9am (and
not kicking everybody out at 6am because they have to be totally out of the
space at 9am), that includes sensible and stationary price of admission,
that includes party extras like baloon-sculpting clowns, clean restrooms,
fresh fruit, toilet paper, jungle gyms, second rooms, afterparties, deejays,
live acts, whatever.  basically DELIVER ON PROMISES or SUFFER THE
CONSEQUENCES.  of course you, i, every promoter and every raver knows that
it is an idle threat because the next time you go to a party that advertises
two rooms and free water for $20 and you get there and pay $25 and get one
room and a broken water fountian next to a table of $2 bottles of water what
are you gonna do?  that's right, you'll probably bitch in the car on the way
home and, to use a line from the movie "Liar, Liar", "..bend over and take
it up the tailpipe" (to which the attendant replies: "you've been here
before, haven't ya?")

of course, i'm willing to support any movement to protect the individual
short of a governing action.  Some of the most effective ways of dealing
with this situation are the reviews posted to this list and others like it
that tell straight up what the situation and event was like.  if you get
scammed at a party, tell us about it.  tell us what happened.  tell us what
party it was, who threw it, how you got taken and how you're going to deal
with it.  if i had time i might collect the well-written ones that detail
the situations and describe how to avoid them and put them into a little
'zine and pass it out at parties.  i'd call it blacklist (not blacklisted
411, which is a different magazine altogether!).  promoters who deliver on
what they promise would be happy to see it happen, and those who put
together bullshit events would be terrified and, most likely, hostile.

of course your alternatives are to continue to get robbed blind and quit
going altogether, neither of which sound great.

					do something about it.

and even if it includes going out of town to support your scene ...

 ... your scene, by definition, is where you want to be and happen.  not the
things that happen in your local geographic region.

(sometimes the hardest things the intellectual massif will face will be the
temptation to stoop to the level of the ones we work against.  resist!
resist!)


enough for now,

One word of caution about that tunnel:

While a secluded location...its not an 'unknown' location.  I know several
kids who've got busted smoking down there.   While one (or two) incidents
doesn't mean its the worst spot (it was probably bad luck), I'd keep this
knowledge in mind.

I think it would be cool to set up a boom box or sound or something
*after* flagstaff right there on the stage.  Why not?  At least it could
be looked into.  Being a public park (i think that area is), it might
officially close at some hour...?

I get the feeling people don't realize that the projecthaus thing is
 the pb-cle-list houseparty that i proposed a month or so ago.

Everyone's invited to come out to the projekthaus this sunday 2-9pm (see
MSKW's post) - bring yourselves, friends, records, and food for the
grill (or whatever).  

what is it: its a big-ass haus in the eastern part of pittsburgh that
hosted a bunch of cool free houseparties a little over a year ago.  It
used to be all gutted because it was being renovated (by the lists own
MSKW), but i think its a little more together now - but there's still lots
of space there.

I'm not sure who's all spinning or if the tables are totally open, but
i've heard myself, circuit 6, mskw (of course), reliant, and trout soup
will be there to strike some groovy beats up.

its free of course as in no charge.

 Date: June 28th, this is a Sunday
 Time: 2:00 pm to about 10:00 pm
 Location: @ das projekthaus, 6806 Thomas Blvd, Pittsburgh
 
his info/voicemail is 412.661.MSKW if you need better directions.
its an easy walk from any busroute that goes down 5th avenue.  (71B i
think for example).

a couple questions i have for y'all djs, etc. :

What's the most standard mixer that's used? i.e. What one would one most
frequently see at current parties?  Also, if what mixer is most commonly used
has changed as the scene has evolved, what, over the years, has been the most
standard? 

Also, do most of you who are djs run your equipment through home stereos or do
many of you have more professional set-ups for your personal sound?

well... i dont think for mixing at home you need any sort of
professional setup. i suggest hooking it up to the largest home stereo
you can find in your house. on thing that is very important is to set
the speakers up as monitors, just cause the sound is clearer that way
and nicer for mixing. my parents wouldn't let me hook my techs up to
our home stereo, so i stole our rather powerful set up computer
speakers/subwoofer and hooked em up to my mixer. since they are self
powered (you plug em into the wall), no amp is necessary, and they
provide enuff power for a small room. no amp is necessary for a tap
deck either, so i just steal that from the main stereo when i need to
record something. i also hook up my boombox (of rsp renegade fame) to
my mixer (cause it has two outputs) if i need more sound. more sound
is always a good thing, even if it is from a 8 yaer old $80 boombox.
it would be sweet to have real monitors + an amp, but for now...

does anybody have in their own posession a sound system rivalling (or
approaching) the one at Spike grad party?  if so, can I use it for a free
party in Frick park?  assuming I can get all the permits, the party'd be a
bunch of fun, free, etc...I'd even give you some $ for use of the system.
Tentative date for the party: july 12.

any prob's w/ the date? if not, i'll go for it!

QUESTION:

I have gone to so many parties and for some reason or another I never 
get to stay till close.  Something always goes wrong its like a bad 
dream or something.  Maybe its something I will never be able to do, is 
it my curse.  So what does happen when the party is over?  Do the lights 
come on and the music stops right away?  Does the crowd weed out to 
nobody, then everything stops?  I just wonder.  

I almost made it once, the crowds dwindled, just the hard-core druggies 
were left.  I could have danced all night( me with my natural high with 
the help of a little ginseng) but my friend who drove had to make it 
home before her parents woke.  What a life!  I love raves

The irony is that Old Man Productions seemed to be run by very young
people.  If this was their first event, I think we might be a little more
patient with them.  Everyone makes a few mistakes at first -- except for
Viktor!

I just hope that this experience has taught all the promoters out there to
control their security.  If the building owner is too rigid about the
demands, then find another spot.  The USA Skates parties have had the
friendliest and most respectful security I've ever encountered.  Clearly,
the owner there is willing to work with the party promoter.  

Security should be about making sure there aren't any fights, that no
one gets hurt and that no one steals the money -- and that's it.  Leave
the freedom to the ravers!

Can I just have an Amen here? I mean really folks.... pass the word.
I totally understand trash talking on events/promoters that have
this bullshit attitude that they are just there to take money and draw
a crowd. It's due to events like these that the renegade in Pitts. was
such a success on the vibe and only the 5-0 brought down the
positivity of the event, not the promoters or the location.

What gets me even more is the lack of respect for the attending ravaz.
that this shows. Do ya'll really think that PLUR came about as a topic
of relavent discussion amongst ravaz because some naive candy suckin
wannabe got all giddy and started wishful thinkin? I don't. There are
still events, although getting farther apart, that I have attended in which
I have felt it in full effect. Knowwhaddameanvern? Nonetheless, I still
try to take that positivity w/ me every time and share it w/ as many ppl
as I can......nothing in this world makes me a happier person than when
that vibe is returned. It is my reason for going. I don't find it often enough
IRL (in real life) but I know that at a good party it feels like waves
across ma body. Kabamm!! (headbobbinfoolthatIam)

mmmmmm...... makes me anxious to go to Stealth on Sat. Mostly because
those that I have met involved w/ it, as well as those that I have talked to
that plan to go, are all ppl that I have shared this w/ in the past.
*gettinmushy*
hehehe*grin* - "hey...I luv U mannnn."

just 2cnts from another geriatric rava,

so have i.

>I have been to events where a big pile

this is rare at best.  how many parties have you been to and how many have
free stuff readily available at the door?

>I have been to parties where the water is free ($0).  
usually when i see this, its a spigot or water fountain.  never bottled,
but i really wouldnt give away free bottled water all nite as a promoter.
stuffs not cheap.   whoever thought to put water in bottles and sell it
prolly got one hell of a promotion.  8-)

>I have been to events where the promoter's crew or friends are

such as?  how often.  i 

>I've been to parties where the live acts

this is the live act promoting itself, not the promoter.  i've seen this.
at tilt 611 records dumped prolly 100 mixtapes, 10 shirts, and about 1000
stickers into the crowd at the front, but guess what, 611 records did it to
promote 611 records.   not the promoters delivering on a "free mixtape to
first 100 ppl" or "free records at the door"

>if the promoters put bullshit on the flyer they are bullshit promoters, no
>excuses.  just because everyone else promises stuff and doesn't deliver does
>not lower the standard for what a good and/or reputable promoter is.
you know, if i were really a motivated person i would try and dig out EVERY
FLYER FOR EVERY PARTY I'VE BEEN TO AND START COUNTING THE NUMBER OF "FREE
THIS OR THAT'S" AND ADD THEM UP....    then add up the free shit i got,
guess what?  i can PROMISE the numbers will NOWHERE NEAR BE CLOSE!

>people learning to accept getting screwed from many different angles is
>*exactly* what brings this scene down.
its part of being a consumer.   getting ripped at the door isnt the only
sucky thing.   i own a SHITTY '92 SATURN that costs more to maintain than
my old '83 TOYOTA STARLET.   i've had the oh-so-hyped saturn in the shop
more in 2 years than the 3 i drove the toyota.  dont get me started on the
hype around video games and computer hardware (not to be confused with dj
hardware =)
advertising is designed to get you to want something, and more often than
not its misleading or just plain lies.

trouty.

no, i want what i want, i want instant gratification, and i want it now.
i'm an atomic baby,  born and bred on microwave ovens  and teevee that's 
always there to keep me warm and happy.....

well i for one bitch during and after the party, sometimes for a long time.
 i'm sure you've heard a few on here before.  if at all possible i usually
avoid a promoter after being burned usually twice.   once i can figure a
promoter had a bad party or a conspiracy against them.  twice i see a
pattern.   well once if its pretty bad....   guess what i do when i'm pissy
with a promoter?  I DONT GO!  THEY DONT GET MY MONEY!   but i'm in the
minority i believe.  i believe most ppl will go back, drop another 5-45$ on
another party thrown by that evil promoter that changed his price.  on a
related note that follows from my last post, i'll never buy another saturn,
guess why?   i dont like the one i have, no reason to do it again.

well ppl post here alot about the good the bad and the ugly, i just think
alot of ppl hit the delete button and dont give it much of a second thought
especially if they werent at the party.

go for it.  most mags i've seen are self glorified drivel, preaching pure
PLUR and mentioning nothing bad.

>of course your alternatives are to continue to get robbed blind and quit
>going altogether, neither of which sound great.
find a happy medium....   which isnt ideal.  i want to be at a ass-kickin
party every night, but i'm hardly rich, so i pick what i believe will be
the good ones.  i go based on the ADVERTISING and what I PERCEIVE to be the
PROMOTERS REPUTATION.

usually lights and cleanup and ppl lounging around that dont want to leave.
getting direx to the afterhours or arranging one.
bumming rides and the like from ppl who realize they got stranded.
i've been to a couple that almost never ended.  the deejays kept playing
and playing and noone bothered to shut stuff off, ppl brought records in
from their cars as soon as they realized it was like open tables.  2-3 in
the afternoon and i left.

So who all's going to crave it? Only $10 bux! :)  I know you all 
probably hate the rascal house, but surprisingly enough, I've only 
been there once (when we did bLooP! last yar) and didn't think it was 
all that bad...Besides, all you people talking about all these sucky 
ass big parties that don't deliver - well, this party doesn't seem to 
promise much, it's all locals, and it should be fuckin cool :) Hope 
to see some of ya there!

well i dont know much about the performers at got moog sat nite, and most
other ppl i've talked to havent either, but the promoter sent me a cd that
i've listened to a few times.  its difficult to describe alot of it.  some
is very experimental, a bit noisy, definitely cool shit.  its not dance
music by any stretch of the imagination.   its more listening music or
atmosphere music.
theres more infos @ http://www.cdtoad.com/june27/index.html
i might go depending on alot of things?

i've been having difficulty making valid points lately, but i must say...a lot
of people seem to complain about the skating rink space, but i always always
have so much fun there. the security is usually very tolerable and being
harrassed by them is rare. the space for caffeine may have been a lot better
than the skating rink, but weighing all of the factors, i'm sure the party
would have been so much better there.  yeah, with the rad lineup and and not
being treated like i lived in nazi germany, it would have been such a better
party. oh well, i guess there isn't a reason to dwell on it now.

Any reason no one has said under the bridge behind flagstaff? The one with 
the manmade pond?  Though we may be disturbing other people that go down 
there but last i checked there is no easy way to get there by car so the 
chances of police getting us is fairly small (I dont think the dirt roads 
are public access)

I might try to do projecthaus on sunday, hopefully both that and flagstaff,
although i can place little priority on flagstaff.  i wrote this about my
expected sun trip to flagstaff before learning of p.haus:

As far as safety (incoming trains), I've walked end to end & back twice w/ 
no
train... a train would be harder to notice if music, dancing were going on,
though.  But there's no better way to find out for sure than to actually 
check
it out.  I'll lead a group down after Space Jam this Sunday regardless of a
ride home (I can always PAT bus or walk) assuming a group is following me, 
and
go alone if not.  Someone might want to consider bringing some pot, because
it's an excellent place to get high b/c the cherry becomes the only light
visible + it's creepy + it's getting high.  Just not so much pot that we
forget which end of the tunnel to exit from :)

I no longer am certain i'll be at flagstaff on sunday, but if i am you're 
sure
to find me.

Someone mentioned there are other/better potential renegade spots near
flagstaff (i think)...maybe the golf course, especially later in the night.
Know of any (spots)?  tell me.

I agree with your ideas of fruitrollups vs phat pants.  I just keep 
forgetting to get  stuff before I go. It would be nice to be able to walk 
around with bottles of watter for people but I fear too many people would 
think they were spiked.

As for unassuming life I believe einstein meant essentially what is 
followed to the extreme in the buhdic (sp?) way of life. Living minimally 
as required for basic comforts and survival.  For each person this is 
extremely different and extremely subjective in my opinion.  The krishnas 
for example have a predfined religeos definition whereas vegan is one or 
vegitarean is another.  Einstein went without shoes for a long time of his 
life. It was not purely from his eccentric style but mainly because he 
simply did not believe they served a usefull purpose and hence had no 
reason to spend on them.

Thomas edison did not have a bed.  He found his desk perfectly comfortable 
and was able to get back to his work faster.

BTW: I have that book to and I love it, though I havnt read it in a while.

Subject:	{pb-cle} phat pants vs fruit roll ups

NOTE: if you don't want deep intellectual stimulation (not that there's
anything wrong with that), Don't read this!

this was my biggest point in my little letter about possible tunnel 
parties,
and it has of yet gone unnoticed do i wanted to reiterate for the
"intellectual discussion" massive.  NOTE: i will be using the term 'fruit 
roll
up'  as synonimous with 'any form of innexpensive (& not necesarily fruity)
goodness' and 'phat pants' for 'any form of expensive 
self-indulgence'....the
self quote:

Maybe I'll even take some of the money I
still have because I bought goodwill pants for 5 instead of hillfiger for 
50
and buy some fruit roll ups (or some other form of intense fruity goodness) 
as
extra incentive to thoroughly enjoy yourselves

careful observation leads me to believe that people really enjoy being 
handed
fruit roll ups at random intervals.  it is also quite fun to be the one 
giving
them, in part because it means your world fills up with smiling faces.

also: while some people just can't seem to get enough of that fruity 
goodness,
others are delighted just seeing someone passing it out. (like it's the
thought that counts or something).. this delight originates from the 
"creative
inspiration" which when put to a good cause results in happiness/good 
vibes,
etc.

some consider money means nothing.  others contend it means everything.  in
the case of creative inspiration, money is a catalyst (but so is 
shoplifting
skills)
[a catalyst is something that speeds/facilitates a process, in this case
taking creative inspiration and turning it into happiness/good vibes]

so next time you have some money to spare, keep this in mind, and be sure 
not
to buy wheat germ, because nobody likes wheat germ

I wonder if all rich people in their fifties are as unhappy as my 
parents...

Let me conclude with a quote from Albert Einstein, a man who (in my 
opinion)
definitely would have supported our rave scene:

"How strange is the lot of us mortals!  Each of us is here for a brief
sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he 
senses
it.  But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one 
exists
for other people- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being 
our
own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to
whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy.  A hundred times 
every
day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of
other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give 
in
the same measure as I have received and am still receiving.  I am strongly
drawn to a frugal life and am often oppressively aware that I am engrossing 
an
undue amount of the labor of my fellow-men.  I regard class distinctions as
unjustified and, in the last resort, based on force.  I also believe that a
simple and unassuming life is good for everyone"
-from "the world as i see it", a passage in the book "ideas and 
opinions"...i
just bought the book; contact me if you want more of his wisdom

note:Einstein believed in democracy as a political system

If you can explain to me what an "unassuming life" is, I'd be happy.

"a man can do what he wants, but not want what he wants"-Schopenhauer (I 
also
found this in that book)----I am not entirely sure that one can't want what
they want...

the moon is out
Seth

PS- I've been out of school for a few weeks now, and in case you're 
wondering
I'm venting my excess intellectual energy on you.  i hope you don't mind.

if i am allowed to reach back to my first rave parties thru the present this
was a *commonplace* event in the mid-south in late '94.  when tribes like
*BAM* and Funkopolis were just getting started they used to do that stuff
all the time (note:  i cannot speak pro or con to the quality of those
groups or promoters nowadays)

actually, i have been to parties where *bottled water* was given away for
free.  It was _expensive_ for the promoter, but it was what the promoter
wanted to have happen.  it was a purposefully crafted situation to help
people have fun and forget their worries and enjoy the party and each other.
I know this for a fact because i was working on the sound/light crew of the
event (in august '95) and heard the promoter set one of his lackeys in line
for making a sign that said " water $2 ".  He made his money on the party
back and was able to pay everyone in full and create an awesome party.  It
was a lot of hard work but afterwards when i quizzed him on it, he said he
enjoyed it and would do it again.

> >I have been to events where the promoter's crew or friends are
> >actually passing out good records.
> such as?  how often.  i

again, back in nashville/memphis/knoxville in '94 - '96 every other party
was sponsored at least in part by a few record labels whose names you'd
recognize that were just trying to make their mark.  they'd send 2-3 boxes
of 200 cassettes each for us to pass out at the parties.  the music wasn't
exactly my taste (it was straight up "trance" and i was a househead at the
time), but they were giving it away regularly.  this is also where i we
introduced to the emit records compilation series t:me when i picked up a
_CD_ for free of t:me '96.  i still play it sometimes but it's so scratched
few CD players will track it anymore...maybe one day i'll find another copy.

granted, it is a blatant act of self-promotion, but the guys in chicago
affiliated with the Hip House record store would always toss a stack of
thier new pressings into the crowd at parties.  i got hit in the head by one
once.  This is still a regular occurrence (for obvious reasons).

sure, that's advertising.  heck, i'm a big fan of clever marketing...that's
what makes the super bowl so entertaining!  but in the 'real world' when
someone offers something and then you pay for it and they they just don't
deliver, that person gets legal action taken against them either by the
consumer or on behalf of the consumer by 'consumer groups'.  I'm not sure
that something like that is necessary in this scene at this point...maybe it
is.  but what i am sure of is that this scene will never improve, will never
regenerate, will never go anywhere but downhill if people do not use their
brains in deciding what to do, in what events to attend, and in deciding who
to believe.

i dunno.  i went there today to look for stuff in the midwest and there
seems to be alot of old stuff there and 2-3 entries for the same ones.   a
bit disorganized at best.   i was turning up cinci and cols for mountain
events (western desert states)   oh well, i'll have to keep at it over the
weekend!
i dont know off hand who maintains the grid's programming or if its still
maintained at all really, it seems like a good idea esp. for areas that a
list or dedicated web page doesnt cover.

To All INterested Parties:

Its true...its the return of the projekthaus thing. There will be a party
on Sunday, and it sure is free!!! (They have always been and will be as
long as I can possibly swing it). Geoff is extremely astute in noting that
there will be a grill (two in fact one vegetarian, one meaty) but you do
have to bring a little sumptin' to put on it. Also, at least two
turntables (maybe more) and they will be tech 12's courtesy of many list
members (thanks guys). I am going to try to have open tables but I don't
know how many will show with records. THe intention here is to have fun
and not fight over the toys so lets be nice, okay!! lovee lovee kisee
kissee...

Oh right, directions:

DO NOT take the 71B (good guess tho geoff). If you would like to avail
yourself of this cities fine public transportation get the 71C on Fifth to
Penn and Linden or the 71D (the best bus) to Fifth and Thomas. General
driving direx are as follows:

>From downtown Pgh, Oakland, and shadyside; take fifth ave away from
downtown to the intersection of fifth and thomas (one block past penn ave)
turn right. go just over one block to 6806 thomas blvd. large brick house
on your right. (71D fans get off at fifth and thomas and follow above
direx).

>From Squirrel Hill take wilkins away from downtown to Dallas, turn left
onto Dallas. Folow Dallas across Penn to Thomas blvd. Go just less than
one block to 6806 Thomas blvd. red brick house on your left.

71C fans get off at Penn and Linden. cross Penn ave and continue down
Linden past Meade street to Thomas Blvd (two blocks from Penn) Turn right,
go two houses to 6806 thomas blvd. 

If you are coming from out of town and are unfamiliar with Pgh
neighborhoods Please email me and I willl do my best to send some direx to
you. Thanks a million. Hope to see you all there!!!

i add files to a directory with a little preformatting and a script
compiles it real nice and pretty into the webspace that it sits in.  once a
week it gets mailed out by a cron job so its mostly automated once the
events are dropped in the dir.  i left it to be mailed out whilst i'm gone,
it just wont have any new additions for 2-3 weeks.
also i took the archive script down for now, coz if it blows up (and it has
before) i wont be around to fix it.....
well thats prolly more than you ever cared to know about the rom....  =)

Is anyone going that has a few spots free?
Is anyone else besides me stuck without transportation?
Does anybody know if there is going to be the ability to pull up to the 
campgrounding area? Or is the parking lot going to be a mile away?

Is coolville ohio the one on the border of west virginia?

Specifically, if I cant find a ride or I can find a couple a people to go 
in with me Im thinking of breaking down and renting a car or if I cant 
because of age (and how lame is this) ill rent a goddamn uhall. I think it 
would be hilarios to sleep on matresses in the back of a uhall! Plus we can 
cart all the shit we want to make our stay enjoyable!

Yo kids, don't be so quick to judge *all* promoters listed on every flyer.
Just remember to make the distinction between the crew that is *actually*
hosting the party and the others who just might be helping out or throwing out
their support. As we all know, promoting crews who combine to throw parties
can sometimes get the shaft when one end doesn't pull their weight and the bad
crew brings the others down. I'm having horrible flashbacks from Step Into
Hell....

What is Hardcore?
by D.J. Deadly Buda

     The adjective "Hardcore' generally refers to something's most basic
fundamental elements, it' original reason for being, it's natural state
in relation to existence.  Oxford's American Dictionary's first
definition for "hard core" is "irreducible nucleus" and the second is
"the most active or comitted members of a society". Since such
definitions are flattering to one or a group's ego, the adjective
"Hardcore" is thrown around loosely with abandon, often used to describe
pale imitations of the real thing. "Hardcore" in relation to rave
culture or "electronica" (or whatever the major media conglomorates deem
to call it at the present time) is often mis-used, as stated above, or
ignored altogether, in order to obscure the rave culture's origins and
replace them with those that are deemed more commercialy suitable to a
perceived mainstream audience. Thus, it becomes neccessary to have a
mutually agreed upon definition of the word "Hardcore"-not only to
expose some of the short history of the phenomena to those that may not
have been around for the formative years, but also re-fresh the
collective memory for those that were.
			The "Raves' of the early 90s had some very basic elements:
1.Technology had	reached a point where more people than eever could
cheaply and easily produce art and music of "professional quality",
bypassing traditional commercial avenues of production, bringing the
general populace creativity unencumbered by market limitations imposed
by hierarchies far removed from the creative/social source.
			2.The art, music, fashion and writing being produced was a unity of a
variety of sources, because the technology primarily was based on
assimilating, collaging and combining (scanners, mixers, samplers).
These different sources were a variety of late 80's early 90s
sub-cultures and a potpourri of larger , often foreign, culturual
influences. Essentially people were appreciating and assimilating
different aspects of different cultures. There was a unity of different
people. 
			3.With all the interaction, commonalities were quickly recognized,
and seemed quite fortuitous and over-whelming. A sense of spirituality
was being formed-based on the recognition of the events conspiring to
achieve this "unity", and how they were parralleled by various other
cultures' religious and spiritual practices. 
	    Thus, these basic elements had come together to begin synergizing
an entirely new culture, with it's own dance, music, art, language,
history and spirituality.

				In it's  ideal form, (notably achieved a number of times), the
"rave" came into being from Western Culture's pressing needs i.e.
community in a multi-ethnic and cultural society, spirituality that
related more directly with the world currently lived in, creative
productions that communicated the creative person's feelings and
inspirations un-hindered by main-stream society's out-dated predjudices
and mediums. The raves' relation to society was a much needed social
cohesion combined with a creative and spiritual outburst (humans' common
method of initially contemplating existence).
			The original ravers applied the adjective "Hardcore" to describe the
raves' social, spiritual, and creative elements. the term was
consciously assimilated (of course) from the punk movement's
Do-It-Yourself ideals. In fact, the hi-jacking of technology, the
repetitive shamnic dance rhythms, the internet, the dj mixing, etc. were
all considered "core" elements in their respective genres. this further
ingrained the adjective "Hardcore" to the early rave movement, as it
conspired to combine what it considered the strongest elements into a
new form.
			So "Hardcore" in relation to raves, refers to-the creative arts
exploration of spirituality, achieving a social cohesion within the
larger society. 
			In order to achieve this, "Hardcore" must constantly explore new
avenues ofcreativity, pushing limits, analyzing barriers, and
questioning existence, and existing structures, eventually refining the
conclusions and manifestations into something to be experienced, learned
from, and acted on.

I have only been disappointed at approximately one rave(the only $20 or 
more rave I ever went to).  See thats my thing I  am sooooooo f#*kin' 
cheap!! There is no disappointment there, only surprises.  Some of those 
raves had great djs and two or more rooms of music.  I am not going  to 
be tricked into thinkin' there is three rooms when there is only one.  
Most people at the cheap raves give out stuff.  I got lotsa candy, 
water, icy sticks, glow stix, ginseng, everything etc...  Always a good 
vibe.  

That is just advice I give and live by.  Expensive raves are overrated 
as far as I am concerned--might as well go to a concert at starlake 
ampitheatre.

Are you in pgh?  Cause if so, then are you talking about the clouds on
friday night at around 7-9?  I was with my boyzz frankie-g and seth
crazy baum, and about 40 geese chillin outside of the science center
when we saw some insane looking clouds.  High contrast type stuff.
Some looked like big wisps, while others looked like huge picturesque
type clouds.  Then we saw two omnimax, where we saw Dan Kelly with his
good looking girlie.  Another set of people we talked to later that
night also noticed the bomb clouds.

This is far from Old Man Productions first event.  I don't know how
many they have had in between, but I have a flyer from one of their
events that was on 8-16-97, and they had a nice line-up of james
christian, boo williams, huda huda , rob riddum and others.  With free
afterhours as well by tik tak, CARLOS, and dust.  Anyone go to this?

No, actually NASA does have an anti-gravity chamber.  BTW, frankie,
the person that told me there was an anti-gravity chamber was Ian
Erlich =)

Yeah, it was called Electric Playground, and it was held at Fun n Stuff in
Macedonia (next to Hudson) last August. James Christian and Boo Williams never
showed if my memory serves me correctly ('course, I could be losing another
memory chunk b/c of age ;-) hehe) But despite the no-shows, I had a great
time!  Huda Hudia was great, and Carlos showed up at the actual party and spun
(instead of the after party)... Dont forget that Old Man Productions also
threw Just Dance, at Peabody's also. I didnt go, but you know how things at
Peabody's go... --Casey--

Oops! My apologies to all of those involved. I just dug up the flyer, and Just
Dance on August 23rd was NOT thrown by Old Man Productions, but rather by
Superdank Productions. I just do not know WHAT I was thinking... must be the
heat... hehe... so scratch that earlier comment on Just Dance, sorry.

	Just to keep everybody informed, as of now ( 4:00 PM Sat) everything is on
track for Stealth of the Night....

	Every DJ is here except for Kid Entropy (who's coming in later today), DJ
Sonic (he thinks he needs more practice or something; he still might spin)
and Rob Riddum who just simply denied that he was ever going to spin for
us. Oh well, the DJ lineup was looking a bit overcrowed anyways; this gives
more time to each DJ.

	My friend, who is thowing the party, is @ the Venue right now finishing
setup... he just called and said that they've got the spot looking REALLY
good down there.

Also, I believe I forgot to mention that there will be lights (provided by
various contributors) and a Laser show (provided by Lovelight Lasers)...

I'll post the DJ lineup in about an hour, along with the directions.

PLUR
Ron

  FORTE RECORDINGS is the brainchild of Chicago drum and bass 
  DJ's 3D and SNUGGLES. Created in 1997 as an outlet for American 
  drum and bas producers, the label has risen in less than a year to 
  be the top domestic label specializing in exclusively drum and bass 
  and jungle. 12" releases from the label have garnered critical praise 
  from US  magazines like URB, MIXMAG, and XLR8R, as well as 
  British counterparts such as ATMOSPHERE and KNOWLEDGE. 
  3D and SNUGGLES have succeeded in corralling the top producers 
  of drum and bass in the US as part of the FORTE stable of artists, 
  following the blueprint set by GOLDIE's British METALHEADZ 
  imprint. FORTE releases have included acclaimed producers such 
  as KINGSIZE, SLAK, WISC, KID ENTROPY, FLOW and JAY WIX. 
  As well as from 3D and SNUGGLES themselves. This CD presents 
  a year's worth of FORTE work and includes 12 tracks that have 
  never before appeared on a compilation. Highlights include the 
  stunning "KEEPSAKE" by NYC phenom WISC, "CLONES" by 
  3D and SNUGGLES, and "JEWELER'S DIVE" by Minneapolis 
  native JAY WIX. 
  
  
  track listing:
  
  Q SYSTEM "Three Wheel Motion"
  DJ 3D "Millennial Dawn"
  WISC "Keepsake"
  FLOW "Smoking Section"
  KID ENTROPY "Ippon" (It's on)
  3D and SNUGGLES "Clones"
  DESPERADO "Ride the Rhythm"
  WISC "The Twist"
  3D and SNUGGLES "Template"
  SLAK "Kosmonautz"
  DJ 3D "Cairo" (SNUGGLES remix)
  JAY WIX "Jeweler's Dive"

FORTE RECORDINGS is the brainchild of Chicago drum and bass 
DJ's 3D and SNUGGLES. Created in 1997 as an outlet for American 
drum and bas producers, the label has risen in less than a year to 
be the top domestic label specializing in exclusively drum and bass 
and jungle. 12" releases from the label have garnered critical praise 
from US  magazines like URB, MIXMAG, and XLR8R, as well as 
British counterparts such as ATMOSPHERE and KNOWLEDGE. 
3D and SNUGGLES have succeeded in corralling the top producers 
of drum and bass in the US as part of the FORTE stable of artists, 
following the blueprint set by GOLDIE's British METALHEADZ 
imprint. FORTE releases have included acclaimed producers such 
as KINGSIZE, SLAK, WISC, KID ENTROPY, FLOW and JAY WIX. 
As well as from 3D and SNUGGLES themselves. This CD presents 
a year's worth of FORTE work and includes 12 tracks that have 
never before appeared on a compilation. Highlights include the 
stunning "KEEPSAKE" by NYC phenom WISC, "CLONES" by 
3D and SNUGGLES, and "JEWELER'S DIVE" by Minneapolis 
native JAY WIX.

No family affair for me.
Also, I won't be doing that Vinyl Communications Tour thing:
(i'm sad about missing that, but I'll live - 
 tom/reliant/nurse 'cutdown' will be fillin in)

I will however be in DC over the weekend of the 4th, and I'm wondering if
anybody knows of anything fun going down.  I think the whole environment
of the city will be entertaining, with people both tryin' to show their
'american pride', and people trying to show the hypocricy of the US.
But if there's anythin' great goin' on I'd like to know (I know the
metalheadz tour was last year). ;)

Any knowledge?

Trouty-

I realized that the direx I sent to the list might not be enough for you
(and anyone else coming from points west). So here goes...

Take 80 or 76 east to 79 south to 279 south to 376 east.
Take the first exit after the Squirrel Hill Tunnel, it will be the
Edgewood Swissvale Exit (Braddock Ave). Follow signs for Braddock Ave.
Stay to the left on the exit ramp, this will bring you to a stop sign
where you will make a right onto Braddock Ave.
Stay on Braddock to Penn Ave. 
Left onto Penn to N. Linden Ave.
Right onto N. Linden, two blocks to Thomas Blvd.

Just in case any of you has nothing better to do this Thursday night (July 2),
Club Elevation (Lift, whatever) is bringing Afrika Bambaataa to Cincinnati.
I'm viewing it as a kick of for my FA4 weekend :) I'm not sure on the exact
price, I can check on that...but I think it's like $10 or something. Maybe
$14. I dunno. If any one cares and wants more info, you can call the info line

Hey all-

Well, we all woke to threatening skies but for all of you who aren't
familiar with the projekthaus there is a large covered porch, and I've
cleared lots o' space for dancing and socializing inside soooo...

even if it rains we will still be hosting the pb-cle-raves BBQ today. The
grills will be up and running on the front porch and mucho musik will be
emanating from the windows and doors, so bring some food, and some records
and a little something to drink. Oh yeah- on your way out the door, shake
your fist at the sky and damn the rain to hell (I'm pretty sick of it by
now).

love + mixes

I was thinking about making a sign and putting it on my tent. Does anyone
thing this would be a good/bad idea? The sign would look a little something
like this

*NET RAVERS*
IRC #RAVE
MW-RAVES
PB-CLE RAVES
AOL  (gottah repazent)

If you guys think a set time would be good then let's do that, otherwise just
gravitate to the sign whenever you feel like it? What do ya think? How did you
guys get that net meet going at the first family affair? I wasn't there, but
Stevie said there were about 50 net kids...

okay so keoki can't make records ... but there is a reason he's so popular on
the 1+2's.  when i lived in ny he did a weekly event at one point called
disco2000 at the now-defunct limelight.  the boys and girls there just
couldn't get enough of him, he's actually very smooth on the tables, unlike
the sounds he gets produced in the presses.  his ability to work with a
technically challenging mixer is phenomenal - if you're really rolling you can
hear about 20 separate bleeps and tweaks but 

okay so anywayz

someone pleez tell me what was going on in schenley park last night.  i was
playing soccer on the cathedral lawn when i noticed a distant <bm ch, bm bm
ch> and started walking towards the music since i hadn't checked my email for
a couple daze, thinking that maby one of u kids managed to tote a system into
the woods ... i ended up taking a really bad trip cos i got stuck in a
hurricane that lasted for 3 hours.  i was totally tripping cos i was trapped
in this little telephone-booth size gazebo by one of the moldy ponds ... ducks
and mosquitos were harrassing me ... the pond started flooding ... for three
fucking hours i was just beatboxing and rapping to myself (cursing el nino was
a recurrent theme), then i started singing nursery rhymez and eventually i had
nothing to sing but scales ... then as i finally got the fuck out of there
some disco house started bumipin again and i was just like fuckit i was
starving needed a cigarette lonely cold wet 

what the hell was going on

well ... love and rockets -

>Yeah, it was called Electric Playground, and it was held at Fun n Stuff

Hey!  This was my first rave!  (I remember thinking, God -- all these 
kids are so young!  Things really opened up for me around then...)  The 
funny thing is that it was only about 3 minutes from my house -- but 
every other party I've been to has been at least 40 min away.  Blah 
blah, just reminiscing ...

There should be more parties at Fun N' Stuff.

I remember someone looking for anything by DAN EFEX.  This is for whomever
this was:  I don't know if you've found it yet, but PureAcidMixTapes has a
double tape by him called EPILOGUE.  Here's the text associated with it:
DAN EFEX
"Epilogue"
The original Epilogue double tape returns with new artwork for 98. The
Excursions in Hardtrance tape is euphoric intelligent sounding hardtrance
with heavy 303s, and the Excursions in Goa tape is geometrical goa trance.
2 tapes 180 min $16 ($2 s/h)
Hope this helps you out!  Just incase you don't have the addy for Pure Acid
it's www.pureacidmixtapes.com  and it's under the May 1998 section of their
New Dope Tapes category.  Once again, hope this is what you were looking
for!

Thursdays at metropol is now being done by John from House Of Styles...
What I remember from what John told me when I was in an altered state of
mind:

It's OVER 18 NOT OVER 21.... wow, big up to John for that! Apparently
the over 21s who still wish to drink can do so upstairs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That would be totally amazing.. can anyone confirm this?? did anyone check it
out last week? we definitely need a 18 & over club w/ amazin muzik!

It's true.  Metropol is 18+ w/ID.  It's called "Atomic" the first 3 Thursdays
of the month and the last Thursday of every month will be "The Atomic Bomb".
The Atomic Bomb will have one or two major headlners.  The cost of Atomic is
around $5 for the 18-20 crowd and around $3 for the 21+ crowd.  The cost of
the Atomic Bomb will be slightly higher (I'm Guessing $7-$8 for 21+ and $9-$10
for 18-20).  The resident DJ's will be Product 19, BeeDee, 7up, and Zemo.  

Peace,
Pat Friend


P.S.  Please don't quote me on the prices because I'm not sure exactly how
much it will be.

Well if its any consolation my ride has be disapearing and repearing and 
disapearing. So I still dont know if im going or not.  I know someone who's 
offering to make sure I get there (thanx The President ;) tho.

Ive just not said anything until I know im going but glancing further down 
my email I think I might be confirmed.

Yah, not enough aolers realize that the rest of net hates you purely on 
principle.  Not saying that I do, I couldnt give to shits and for 
mailbombing a bitter enemie those free hours come in handy, but a good 
chunk of the net prolly does. :)

O.K.  How bout this one.....
This Tuesday, we present Superstar DJ Keoki in a very rare, very intimate, bar
setting. The Location... Sexx 11213 Detroit ave.  CLEVELAND
ONLY 100 people can be admitted.
Door opens at 11:00.  Line forms when it does.  Obviously more people will
come than we can fit.
Keoki will select which people will be admitted.  He will play immediately
after selecting his audience.
Except....PB-CLE-RAVES LIST MEMBERS who contact, and sign up with Casey,
HANSLGRETL@ AOL.COM.  If you are on her list you are guaranteed admission
until we reach "legal capacity"  
Hope this is as "cool" for you guys as it is for me.  I'm proud to bring you
this.
Hope to see a lot of you there.
Rob

I remember this party- we brought a couple of people to their first rave,
and Carlos blew them away.  Driving up from p-burgh was a bitch.  The rain
kept us traveling at a a crusin' 25 for a lot of the trip.  I was really mad
at the rain, though, cause I really wanted to ride those go karts in the
middle of the night.  oh well...

I am quite suprized there are so many subscribers to the list as well, but
being a basic list lurker perhaps you can empathize as well.  Unless yer a
major gear-head or promoter you maybe goto one or two parties and month
and check the ROM on occasion to see whats up.  So if yer like me most
posts go unread ;)  And I am sure there are a lot of school email accounts
being filled up during the summer as well esp here in pgh.  It does seem
like most of the posts are being done by a few regulars which is cool but
if i can go out and start a post so can you too! hehe Props to all who
hosted/were involved in the hausparty i had a grreat time and was cool
meeting those of you who i have only skimmed list posts from.  Often posts
become confusing as the average party attendee you dont really know who
the promoters or even a lot of the DJ's are except for some of the
headline acts so a lil hand holding is always appreciated. :)  Also being
from pgh its nice to be on the list to salivate at the multitude of
activities going on by the mistake by the lake and environs ;)

peace out

This is fucking absurd!!!!  Why do you think this mediocre dj has such a big
head and is on his big "EGO TRIP"???  This is exactly why!   I had the chance
to see him last friday here in columbus, and i was unimpressed, very
unimpressed.  Its people like this that make me very angry.  What is he gonna
base his admitance on?  How cool you are vs. how cool joe blow over there is?
or maybe if i bring some crack or heroin and give him some, i could get in.  I
say teach him a lesson and nobody show up. heheheeee

hm, whoever did the local promotion for caffine out there should have 
their fingers broken ;P I went with the crew (like 3 cmu kids who are 
out here in seattle) to the seattle version of caffine and had a really 
good time. while the promoters did make us get rid of our open water 
bottle and there weren't any faucets at the space (hello 
port-a-potties), there were none of the other shady goings on (got to 
bring in our glowsticks, candy, backpacks, etc. and the price was only 
$20 at the door)
ok, so that's my rant. stay away from crack, and shady promoters ;)

whaaaaaaaaat?

damn, me + the rsp cru would be guaranteed admittance if we wore some
cut off jeans + shit :) we'd be choice picks for his
snortin-k-off-the-backs-of-little-boys self :)

i can hardly believe that.

I think I might go to the new function at Metropol on Thursdays.  I
wonder if it's very clubby inthat the people that are going are dressed in
their club gear (i.e. burgher club gear).  If Product 19 is spinning, I'm
sure it will be interesting (anyways, I forget who else is spinning).  Is
anyone else going?  Just curious.  I will be donning my full raver gear
right down to the phattest pants I own.  If anyone else IS going, please
e-mail me.

I'd definitely like to check this out.  From what I've heard from John's
mouth and seemingly confirmed by fellow listkids (Dan K, Pat) is that
Metropol basically gave him full reign as to what he wants to do with the
night.  Ideally, it will end up something like a Buzz type club, with
rotating locals for 3-weeks a month, and a bigger 'rave' type event on the
4th week.  If the price really is $5/$8 that's awesome!   Apparently
there's going to be a variety of music too, from trance, breaks, techno,
house, drum+bass....probably even some hardcore once i a blue moon. ;)
I'd like to check it out this week....I'll see if I can get a car, or hook
something up between folks to get people rides. cool?

BTW:  Thanks to Mike + Jen for hostin' the hausparty on sun.  I was a bit
vapid for other reasons, but all in all it was a *really* nice time.  LONG
LIVE THE SPACE DRUM!  DOWN WITH THE SPACE DRUM! ;)

Well, we haven't really made an official announcement about this yet,
although many people know already, but we figured its about time.  We
haven't seen any flyers (trust us, we've been looking), but they were
supposed to come out.  

Anyways, this Tuesday, the 30th at SteelCityJungle, we're proud to
announce to the full scale debut of Circuit 6.  Although we played at
Commencement and various other small events, this isour first paying
gig and the first time we will be playing on a very large system.  We
plan to tear shit up, and would love to see all the pb-cle massive
gettin' down.  I'm assuming we will be going on first, although we
haven't talked to Sine since he asked us to play nearly two weeks ago.

In addition to us, K-Set and Sine will be playing.  

SteelCityJungle happens everyother tuesday at Club Laga, 3609 Forbes
Ave.
infoline: 734-8443

Hope to see you there,

ABSOLUT + FRANKIE G 
      A.K.A. 
    CIRCUIT 6

     and to answer both of your questions 
     at once...

     i'm not sure. if you could quantify how
     NGL (which, by the way, no longer really
     exists) actually 'commercialized' the scene
     at all, it might be easier to answer. maybe
     they _wanted_ to commercialize the scene.
     but by any account (and mine, i think, might
     be considered reliable or at least unbiased)
     they failed, whatever they wanted to do.

     as far as i am concerned, making the scene
     more accessible and (oh horror) more mainstream
     was the primary issue. 

     but if you want to contest these views that's
     fine. i'm in no mood for antagonism, tho. peace,
     and stuff.

     well, that's a pretty average ratio for a 
     mailing list. many either don't have the time,
     or geniunely don't have anything to say. and
     i don't thing the signal to noise ratio on this
     list needs to go any lower. do you?

     as far as i go, i set up this account on my
     server to monitor the list traffic for my clients,
     NGL, to archive all posts for later reference,
     and _not_ to babble blithely about the weather
     or keoki's sexual preferences.

     BUT...

     i was at projekthaus sunday afternoon (the pissed
     looking guy in black, if i didn't introduce myself)
     and i met enough nice people to make me want to 
     start posting, regardless. (hi trout,mike,tom,jen,
     and whoever else's names i forget).

     so, for what it's worth, another lurker bites the
     metaphorical dust. happy? and please don't say YO!
     again like that. it's annoying as hell.

     oh, excuse any random vitriol - it's monday morning.

     :P

     later,
     henry

This has NOTHING to do w/ raves, but since this is the only mailing list I'm
on, I figured I'd post it anyways:

I'm at the point in my life where I need to decide whether or not I will go
visit college campuses.  This fall I'll be applying to colleges.  A visit
might take up several days to a week of my time and would be composed of
spending lots of time in the car w/ my parents who I get along w/ OK, but
they're not my most favorite people in the whole wide world.  It would also
include visiting the various campuses, and probably also browsing the cities
they're in.  I already have a list of colleges I'd like to attend, which goes
as follows, in no order:
MIT,Brown,CaseWestern,UofChicago,NorthWestern,JohnsHopkins,CMU(safety/i want
to leave PGH)
the college trip would probably be to MIT & Brown. 
My priorities for colleges are:
1) good academics (all above are)
2) good lifestyle @ the college
the first I'm pretty sure won't be influenced by a trip (except acid), but the
2nd might be: the trip would give me a firsthand idea of what the campus is
like/ how it's arranged, and what the city has to offer (this includes the
rave scene, although I most likely won't attend any on a trip)
SO, write back to me (don't make it a post) giving me your wisdom on the
subject.  I want all the info I can get, and if it means anything to you, it
might be a choice of going on the trip or throwing a free party in Frick
(which I still have yet to organize)

Hey guys whatz up?
I am back on the list as the moving to virginia plan didn't pan out!  I
have a recipie for you:
1shot vodka
in a glass of sprite add a glow stick I prefer and drink!

Naw just kidding!

I have never heard of glowsticks causing damage and have worn them
several times however once they are out of the container they dry
quickly and cease to glow- The same thing happens with glow in the dark
body and fabric paints!
I have tried putting them in the freezer but once they have stopped
glowing you can only rejuvinate them by injecting a certain chemical
into them.  I can't remember what it is called but you can purchase a
large quantity of it and a syringe for much cheaper that new
glowsticks...
just info 4 ya - lov, -N-

Um ok I guess I'll have to throw my own party then!  I am helping to
throw Navigate on Nov. 14th and the cost WILL NOT EXCEED 20$.  Look for
the fliers at FA4.  Like I have said before with the exception of
multiple day events like FA4 I have only been to one party that I
thought was worth 25$ and it only cost 20$!  This is a game of supply
and demand - to me a rave is worth any amount of money but I realize
that it is also just a couple of dj's on a nasty old warehouse with some
blinking lights and that 25$ is a quarter of a hundred dollars, 1/8th of
my rent per month and groceries for a week. 20,000 for a thousand person
20$ party is plenty of money for a decent lineup and to prove it I'm
gonna help do it.  Support what you believe in- pay what you can
afford... peace & respect -N-

This was a really fun, little party.  The space was interesting (my 3rd
party there) because it allowed you to mingle with the "straights" in the
Rascal House bar downstairs.  I think this dynamic allowed for a better
appreciation of "raver culture".  It was the sacred and profane contrasted
in a very direct way -- at least that was my reaction. 

Anyway, I was there to hear Product 19, and he didn't disappoint.  He
played some outstanding acid trance and hard acid for almost 2 hours! 
After he had finished, I privately wished that the whole party would have
featured this music (although I'm sure I was alone in that respect).  The
techno spun by Jeff Samuel was also great -- so I didn't complain
too much. 

My only problem was feeling a little lonely.  I didn't recognize anyone
other than Don the sound guy and Johnny Love.  Did anyone from this list
go?  Trout?

Anyway, as local line-up's go, this was a good place for it.  It was
intimate and probably inexpensive to set-up.  The lack of headliners
always brings out a younger crowd, and it was amusing to watch the
multitudes of newbies who obviously had never been to a "rave" before.

At 2:00, I headed out to Trilogy to catch the scene there.  It closed at
2:30, so I wasn't there long.  At 3:00, I headed back to Crave It! and
danced some more.  By that time, it was really packed.

All in all, I would say it was a very successful event, and I'm glad I
went.

well just so u know AOL is FUN!!!!! And I talk to lots of this lists favorite
DJs on AOL frequently.Anyways its only 9.95 a month becuase I got a LOCAL ISP
and connect to AOL TCP/IP.I kept it because there are many things I like about
it.Thinking any less of a person because of what they use to connect to the
net is as bad as hating people becuas eof there race or sexuality.So I just
had to say that hope you AOL bashers think before you speak next time.Its
ridiculous.if you want you can e-mail me back at Irondog@suite224.net.See I'm
as kewl as u are now eh?

 Keoki will select which people will be admitted.  He will play immediately

let's leave it at this.

i did tech support for an isp. we got a lot of aol switchovers.
"what's a web browser?" "what's email? is that like mail?" "how do i read
my email?" "how do i chat?" "how do i connect?" 

people who still insist on opening up aol thinking that aol is the
internet.

i have never spoken with an aol user with a clue when switching them to a
real isp. not once. and i spoke with upwards of 100 ex-AOLers.

Hey... Just wanted to reiterate some things and clear others up... 
This Tuesday (tomorrow night), Superstar DJ Keoki will be spinning here in
Cleveland at a small location, where we can only FIT one hundred (100) people
(legally anyway). Why is it being done this way? I know some of you have
brought up the issue of fairness (in many creative ways), but this is a "fun"
way (both for the people who get in, and Keoki himself) to create an
atmosphere of enthusiasm and "old-skool clubb-i-ness" at the same time. It
isnt meant as an elitist conspiracy, look at it that way if you wish, but it
all boils down to the fact that tomorrow night's gonna be fun! Remember when
clubs (many still do this) in the larger cities used to hand pick the crowd to
get in? This was (and is) because of space and other considerations. Remember
that both the dj and the attendees create the vibe, and Keoki is one HELL of a
vibe creator!!  Okay, enough of this petty, whiny bullshit about this night,
just come out with us and have fun! Email me IMMEDIATELY if you want to get in
tomorrow night for sure... See below for a recap of info... Peace, Casey

The Location:  Sexx, 11213 Detroit Avenue, Cleveland
Size:  ONLY 100 people can be admitted.
Time:  Door opens/line forms at 11:00pm. 
Who will choose who gains admittance?: Keoki himself. He will go on right
after selecting his audience.
HOWEVER!!!  If you contact me and tell me you want to go, you are GUARANTEED
admission (not free, but you WILL get in).

Here is the list of attendees so far from our list: 
Casey Grimm (HANSLGRETL@aol.com)
Stevie Tsang (StevieT216@aol.com)
Amy (Funkybizz@aol.com)
Nicole Hassoun (ncljhssn@otterbein.edu)
Brian Reynard (reynard@BGNet.bgsu.edu)

Just a suggestion, but there is a site near St. Clairsville, OH where
they have a huge country music(bleah) festival for like 100,000 people
every year, and I don't think anything else is done there for the
rest of the year. Someone might want to look into it.

AOL is the single largest ISP in America not because of the
extensive list of services, options, reliability or speed... but
because it caters to the lowest common demoninator and has the
largest budget with which to net them in.  They're deluged  with
advertisements, have artifical limits placed on file sizes, and are
censored with regards to which places they can access and what they
can say on internal message boards.

If only on the last point alone, it is a piece of crap.  I don't
care how low its fees are it is or what a brain-dead operation
double-clicking on the AOL installer can be.  Telecommunication's,
and by this I'm speaking of the internet specificially, main power
lies in its connectivity.  If the tool you use to access something
limits your ability to use it, then you deserve a better tool...
censorship is wrong -- any way you look at it.

So, in regards to the statement of thinking less of a person because
of what sort of access they choose for being online... your ISP is a
choice, just like your OS, applications, or hardware.  If "less"
equates to "ignorant, cheap, and simply doesn't care", then put a
checkmark next to my name, too.  

This goes for all you hotmail, juno, yahoo, et. al people as well.

A: I was stating what the net thinks, not me personally.
B: AOL should die. Unfortunately we cant kill aol so all we can do is hope 
that the users will stop using it.

The net went to shit around the same time that aol happened. Unfortunately 
due to the cheapness of cable modems anyone and their mother can get on the 
net.  There was a day when it was safe to assume that anyone you emailed on 
the net had a head on their shoulders. This is no longer true. There used 
to be a time when the net was its own little world.  Everything was free, 
everyone was free and nothing was regulated. This is no longer true.  Times 
they change, and technology moves on.  Its just convenient to blame it on 
aol since thats where it started.

        Yes this is the case, in addition there are some
        other changes one might note.

        I'm involved with SCJ again, and some other people
        have become un-involved. You should see some
        other noticeable changes in the near future.

        Damn it. ;) There are flyers out BTW, the fact
        that you haven't seen them is worrysome, we're
        going to fix this bad promotion problem ASAP.

Thats a bummer. I went to local13's party LSD (Lets Start Dancing) two or 
three newyears ago and had a blast. It was my first and favorite rave of 
all time as of yet.  I still have the poster I ripped off the wall for it 
and stare it every once in  while.  Its sad to hear they have gone down 
hill.

who went to lsd that local 13 were good...heh...they definitely
changed...  so i am not gonna support some capatalist money making
engine...no justification can make up for what happened in the poconos
last spring as far as i am concerned...oh well...that's just my feeling...

****************************************
FAMILY AFFAIR NET UPDATE,,,,
****************************************
so far, the response has been incredible! we are putting the finishing
touches on the event (okay i lied,  we're making a mad dash to get the rest
of this shit done) heheh. the energy is already so intense round here!
(enuff of the exclamation points!) here's the update...


1. NETMEETINGS
There will be an information / First Aid center centrally located at the
event. i will be building a big ol' bulletinboard for people to post
messages... right next to the official lineup! (what a real and correct
lineup? are we crazy? YES! this year people will actually know who is
spinning when... updated, up to the minute coverage on your favorite djs...
netmeets can be organized from there, i will try to get meetings announced
from the stages. plenty of "Hello, my name is..." stickers will be
provided. hook up with all your aol chat pals, your irc peeps, and folks
from various and assorted mailing lists/ newsgroups..... face 2 face
encounters are fun!


2. FREAK PARADE!
Bring something freaky to wear friday nite! at 4 AM. Represent your
tribe!!! participate in our "fREAK pARADE" .... pimped out, outta space,
whatever vibe you wanna bring to it. we're gonna do it up! get cho' freak on!


3. VINYL SWAPMEET
Got some records layin' around that don't quite fit into that set? Well
check this out! bring em with you, cause we're havin' a VINYL SWAPMEET!
lookin for an extra copy of that special sumpthin' for them doubles tricks?
got some classic tracks you wanna part with, or trade for somethin else? do
you wanna sell me your extra copy of that Jimmy Caster Bunch record really
cheap? heheh.... we're gonna do this saturday afronoon. see the info center
for more info onsite. and dont leave your records out in the sun!


4. OPENING CEREMONY
The West coast tribes collectives will be representing at family affair
this year. Dante, Michael Mannahan, Manoj, and others from our west coast
family will be gathering for a spiritually focused opening ceremony at 5:00
PM Friday. Join with us as we focus our positive energies for the event!



5. FACILITIES

Its all about roughin' it. primitive camping stylee.... (on a nicely mowed
fields) Electricity is somewhat lacking, there are some hookups, but i
don't remember how accessible they are. (its been a while since i've been
there) all soundsystems are generator driven.  no showers, no bathrooms.
(big blue port-o-stinks :) yay!!! i know, it sucks. all i can say is try
gettin' cozy with a big-name dj wit a hotel room :)

there is a river adjacent to the venue, swimming is officially "prohibited"
because of liability, but bring your swimwear anyway :) 
psst! its alot cleaner than that dank nasty skeeter infested pond at fa3
last year.


There are plenty of shady trees at the venue (more so than previous years.)
 less dirt! more green! and as a result, fewer roads. to avoid tearin up
mutha nature's space and getting your ride stuck, We are parking cars in
one area. happy campers will have to carry their stuff to campsites. (i
will be campin' to the right behind the main stage. down the hill, near the
trees, by the river)

we apologize for any inconvenience in advance, but this will afford alot
more room for safe camping, and make everyone's experience with us more
plesant :)

well, the extended 5 day forecast for parkersburg west virginia
(chaw-spittin' distance from the venue, yeehaw) sez partly sunny, 85 hi for
friday. check back at this url for weather updates... 



7. INNERTAINMENT
We have a plan to fit all the djs and performers on within the alotted
time. (6 STAGES!!! not including the renegade soundsystems) barring
unforseen circumstances, everyone will get to get their groove on for an
hour on one of the stages. there will be reggae bands most of the day
saturday. bring yo funk!



8. FRIENDLY SUGGESTIONS

GET THERE EARLY!!!! (like friday AM) its gonna be a wait no matter what
time you get there, but the earlier you get to the event, the faster you'll
get in, the better choice of camping space (trust me its great pickin out a
campsite while you can see :) Plus, it will make the kind peoples at the
gate's job alot easier.  

NO FIREWORKS.... there will be alot of people there. We got enough to do
without having to worry about explosives. You set it off, you get booted.
its that simple. we dont want any problems with the local authorities.

NO NITROUS, NO DRUGS .... leave the vibekillin' gas at home... (yes we're
searchin' your ride) be aware that these things hurt our scene. Actively
discourage open shadiness.

WATCH OUT FOR YOUR FRIENDS! keep track of them! arrange to meet them at the
info center or campsite at regular intervals. we really can't stress it
enough. there are going to be ALOT of people there. Be observant, Be aware,
Help where help is needed. 

Make sure YOU and YOUR FRIENDS -- DRINK ALOT OF WATER!!! If you run out,
come ask me, i'm bringin a shitload of it w/ me. (like 40 gallons!)
heatstroke and dehydration are a real threat at outdoor events. make sure
all of your friends understand this! bring alot of water and SHARE!

Remember to eat and sleep, and oh yeah, DRINK ALOT OF WATER!!!

Smile often and go out of your way to accept everyone around you

Make New Friends

**** REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE THE POWER OF EXAMPLE TO EVERYONE AROUND YOU ****


Peace, Love, Unity, RESPECT...

AOL is the single largest ISP in America not because of the
extensive list of services, options, reliability or speed... but
because it caters to the lowest common demoninator and has the
largest budget with which to net them in.  They're deluged  with
advertisements, have artifical limits placed on file sizes, and are
censored with regards to which places they can access and what they
can say on internal message boards.

If only on the last point alone, it is a piece of crap.  I don't
care how low its fees are it is or what a brain-dead operation
double-clicking on the AOL installer can be.  Telecommunication's,
and by this I'm speaking of the internet specificially, main power
lies in its connectivity.  If the tool you use to access something
limits your ability to use it, then you deserve a better tool...
censorship is wrong -- any way you look at it.

So, in regards to the statement of thinking less of a person because
of what sort of access they choose for being online... your ISP is a
choice, just like your OS, applications, or hardware.  If "less"
equates to "ignorant, cheap, and simply doesn't care", then put a
checkmark next to my name, too.  

This goes for all you hotmail, juno, yahoo, et. al people as well.

I don't know if any knows but is there techno clubs or rave things in 
Ocean City, Maryland.  I rather do more things than get drunk next 
weekend when I go there for vacation.  I would really appreciate any 
scrap of info.

yo, i'm only going to say this once.

i go by experience with the 'average' aol user. which doesn't have the
intelligence to subscribe to a mailing list like that.

and yer damned fucking right i'm an isp snob. maybe cuz i worked at one
for a goddamned long time. gee, ya think?

christ, its not like i said 'hey, all you AOLers are fucking lusers.' i
said that in my experience, aolers are dumber than a ton of fscking dead
glosticks or broken needles. i did not say 'all aolers.' i said the ones
i've had to deal with.

christ, can't i even be my usual disagreeable self anymore? 

oh, btw.. looks like i might have a job.. doing imac. at ameritech. 

would somebody PLEASE fucking translate imac for me? i don't do corp-speak
too well. ;P

Posted by Brandon Harter on June 30, 1998 at 00:38:41:

the site is indeed underwater. but the good news is we have a new space, and
way better than the one in coolville!
the new venue is approximately 2 hours north of the previous venue on 77. 
the full info will be posted on this site shortly...

Exit 83 off 77 at the Dover/Sugarcreek exit. 
go 4 1/2 miles west on old 39 (winds a bit) you will 
see a big silo on the left that sez "Alpine Music Park"
its on the right right after that.

THis venue has SHOWERS!!! and real bathrooms!!! and electrical hookups for
vendors!!!

spread the word people!!!!

Interestingly, the AOL user that posted this, in his reply to me,
MIME quoted my entire article - including full headers - only to
respond with one line of text of his own.

120 lines of text, one of which contained actual content.

I rest my case.

Cool, now we use the list to make death threats.  I'm happy to know that by
inviting the list members, I'm guaranteed a "quality" crowd.
Please let me have your address so I can be sure to send you invites for
everything we do.  I'd also like to send you a copy of Keoki's CD and an
autographed picture.

very good...id like complimentary passes also, just so i can show the 
utmost ignorance by still not attending because i refuse to tolerate 
judgement such as this.
this is utter bullshit.
i cant beleive i read what i did....at first i thought it was a joke, 
but i guess it wasnt.
you cant defend this type of eliticism. this is the kind of stuff that i 
hate. what if i was not on the list, but drove all the way to cleveland 
and keoki didnt think that i had the right vibe to entertain him.
fuck keoki, and fuck this "special event".
really, whick letter of p.l.u.r. does this represent?
i believe that it represents the other letter commonly raped and abused 
by the rave scene:

yes.

AOL is just a tool.  it can be used well, it can be used poorly.

technics 1200-MkII s are tools too.

I hope this wasn't even slightly serious. Intelligent people need 
not state their status, but dumb people pretty much always do.

O.K.  How bout this one.....
This Tuesday, we present Superstar DJ gill in a very rare, very intimate,
apartment setting. The Location... the apartment 11213 Warrensville Road
CLEVELAND ONLY 5 people can be admitted.
Door opens at 11:00.  Line forms when it does.  Obviously more people will
come than we can fit.
Gill will select which people will be admitted.  He will play immediately
after selecting his audience.
Except....PB-CLE-RAVES LIST MEMBERS who contact, and sign up with Casey,
HANSLGRETL@ AOL.COM.  If you are on her list you are guaranteed admission
until we reach "legal capacity"
Hope this is as "cool" for you guys as it is for me.  I'm proud to bring you
this.
Hope to see a lot of you there.
Rob

But there is a big difference between technics 1200-MkII s and the Fisher

****************************************
FAMILY AFFAIR NET UPDATE 6/30/98
****************************************
Okay folks, here's the official scoop.. 

mutha nature has dumped a buncha rain on our old spot, and yes the old
venue is indeed underwater. the owner was navigating his land in a boat
yesterday. since we all dont have boats, we secured a new venue (bigger and
better!)

we got showers, we got power, we got real bathrooms!

The new venue is called Alpine Music Park, located near Sugarcreek Ohio
(only 1.5 hours south of cleveland!) its alot closer to everything, and
alot further from West Virginia.

check the website for directions, etc. www.undergroundpeace.com

so far, the response has been incredible! we are putting the finishing
touches on the event (okay i lied,  we're making a mad dash to get the rest
of this shit done) heheh. the energy is already so intense round here!
(enuff of the exclamation points!) here's the rest of the update... i don't
know how many folks already read this, cause i just subscribed to mwraves
and pbcle raves (without the digest option! jeez, im a glutton for
punishment...) dont shoot me for being redundant. much of the info has
changed...


1. NETMEETINGS
There will be an information / First Aid center centrally located at the
event. i will be building a big ol' bulletinboard for people to post
messages... right next to the official lineup! (what a real and correct
lineup? are we crazy? YES! this year people will actually know who is
spinning when... updated, up to the minute coverage on your favorite djs...
netmeets can be organized from there, i will try to get meetings announced
from the stages. plenty of "Hello, my name is..." stickers will be
provided. hook up with all your aol chat pals, your irc peeps, and folks
from various and assorted mailing lists/ newsgroups..... face 2 face
encounters are fun!


2. FREAK PARADE!
Bring something freaky to wear friday nite! at 4 AM. Represent your
tribe!!! participate in our "fREAK pARADE" .... pimped out, outta space,
whatever vibe you wanna bring to it. we're gonna do it up! get cho' freak on!



3. VINYL SWAPMEET
Got some records layin' around that don't quite fit into that set? Well
check this out! bring em with you, cause we're havin' a VINYL SWAPMEET!
lookin for an extra copy of that special sumpthin' for them doubles tricks?
got some classic tracks you wanna part with, or trade for somethin else? do
you wanna sell me your extra copy of that Jimmy Caster Bunch record really
cheap? heheh.... we're gonna do this saturday afronoon. see the info center
for more info onsite. and dont leave your records out in the sun!


4. OPENING CEREMONY
The West coast tribes collectives will be representing at family affair
this year. Dante, Michael Mannahan, Manoj, and others from our west coast
family will be gathering for a spiritually focused opening ceremony at 5:00
PM Friday. Join with us as we focus our positive energies for the event!



5. FACILITIES

Alpine Music Park in Sugarcreek Ohio is the new home of family affair. this
place is beautiful! Its almost like they just built this place with family
affair in mind. it can accomodate 40-50,000 people! There is plenty of
camping space, and you will all be happy to know it has REAL RUNNING WATER,
REAL BATHROOMS and SHOWERS!!! and utility hookups for vendors,. i'll try to
get down there w/ the digital camera and do some shots of the place and
post em' tuesday nite. its a little closer to columbus than coolville (to
the north instead of south) and a shorter drive from just about everywhere. 

the park is very hilly, (thus the name, alpine) and as a result, your tent
is gonna stay dry!  the venue is a massive amphitheatre with excellent
drainage. it was quite dry when we visited last nite. count on bein hi and
dry! there is a large concrete area in front of the main stage for gettin'
down!


we are still parking the cars in a separate parking area for your safety.
bring a tent. limited mobile home hookups are available. 


6. THA WEATHER
THe weather folks are predicting scattered showers for friday, but we have
some big tents on the way. the venue is a massive amphitheatre with
excellent drainage. it was quite dry when we visited last nite. count on
bein hi and dry! there is a large concrete area in front of the main stage
for gettin' down, as well as paved areas elsewhere for gettin your groove on.

i will be posting pics of the venue on the website later tonite.


7. INNERTAINMENT

We should still be able to fit all the djs and performers on within the
alotted time. (6 STAGES!!! not including the renegade soundsystems) barring
unforseen circumstances, everyone will get to get their groove on for an
hour on one of the stages. there will be reggae bands most of the day
saturday.



8. FRIENDLY SUGGESTIONS

GET THERE EARLY!!!! (like friday AM) its gonna be a wait no matter what
time you get there, but the earlier you get to the event, the faster you'll
get in, the better choice of camping space (trust me its great pickin out a
campsite while you can see :) Plus, it will make the kind peoples at the
gate's job alot easier.  

NO FIREWORKS.... there will be alot of people there. We got enough to do
without having to worry about explosives. You set it off, you get booted.
its that simple. we dont want any problems with the local authorities.
we're gonna be makin enough noise the way it is...

LEAVE YOUR PETS AT HOME....

NO NITROUS, NO DRUGS .... leave the vibekillin' gas at home... (yes we're
searchin' your ride for fireworks and nitrous) be aware that these things
hurt our scene. Actively discourage open shadiness.

WATCH OUT FOR YOUR FRIENDS! keep track of them! arrange to meet them at the
info center or campsite at regular intervals. we really can't stress it
enough. there are going to be ALOT of people there. Be observant, Be aware,
Help where help is needed. 

Make sure YOU and YOUR FRIENDS -- DRINK ALOT OF WATER!!! If you run out,
come ask me, i'm bringin a shitload of it w/ me. (like 40 gallons!)
heatstroke and dehydration are a real threat at outdoor events. make sure
all of your friends understand this! bring alot of water and SHARE!

Remember to eat and sleep, and oh yeah, DRINK ALOT OF WATER!!!

Smile often and go out of your way to accept everyone around you

Make New Friends

**** REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE THE POWER OF EXAMPLE TO EVERYONE AROUND YOU ****


Peace, Love, Unity, RESPECT...

I couldn't agree more.  This type of event does nothing positve for our scene.
The scene and the music should be for everyone. it shouldn't just be for 100
lucky people who are deemed cool enough by a very underated dj.

wow! i got the whole weekend off of work by some miracle, the same as last
year. anyway, i don't have much time to write (hence the crosspost).
everybody remember to bring a ton of water, tarps, extra shoes, dry
clothes, food, kindling for your campfires, insect repellant, and
sunscreen. i will be around the sister DJs system, i have a green pup
tent. i've painted a sign for the system and i'm bringing my mixer (numark
dm1190), cartridges, headphones, slipmats, and a flashing emergency light
(my christmas lights were temporaily confiscated...long story). i will see
everybody else there....

Yo, I had ibm.net (and still do) before I ever had AOL. I connect to AOL
through a tcp/ip connection after hooking up through ibm.net. Anyways, I *can*
use the "real" internet. Really the only reason I *have* AOL is because my dad
gets it free from his work and we stole it and hooked it up at home too. So
*blah!!* I have renegade, stolen AOL and I'm not ashamed...it is fun, I have
met some kewl kids through the chat rooms, and surfing member directory for
people with your interests is handy. If you hate me for my internet
connection, I think that's lame.

>^^< HoUsKiTteN...for my AOL alias, I have about 20 others on *real*
internet programs if you want those, and my 20 other emailing addresses too ;)

chill jason, if anything speakin negative is what kills a scene (which is
kinda
what u did in the above post)...the reason why he is choosing the crowd is 
because the venue can hold only 100 people...in addition, i think u meant that
keoki is an over-rated dj not an 'underated dj'...

the significance of keoki & lady miss kier to the ohio rave scene:

if u remember back to the daze when u first started spinning @ the attik in
akron jason, bout the time i did PLRM which had the review of yur set that
pretty much blew u up...well one of the first dj's to play @ the attik [btw,
for those that don't know the attik was the venue that EPT (eternal peace
tribe) spawned from, when brian broke the partnership w/ matt, UPS formed
UPS is the cru that throws Family Affair)...welp the point is if it wasn't for
Keoki and his infamous reputation, so many kids would not have showed up 
to get the ball rolling for the Attik during its infancy...

...on an even older skoolah tip, it wuz also Keoki & the Project X cru that
really blew up the 'club kid' scene in Cleveland, by doing their Project X
party 
@ the Smart Bar back in the day...but Mr. Sherwood can expand on that...

the significane of Lady Miss Kier:

it is a li'l known fact that Lady Miss Kier was from Parma, Ohio (a suburb of
Cleveland)...the feat that she actually made it outta dat god-forsaken city
& blew up after forming Dee-Lite should've been phenomenal within itself
...but her siginificance within the rave scene has to go two fold...the very 
first underground party ever thrown in ohio (even before Rob's "Tidal Rave"
back in '92, even before the WRUW underground party i wuz involved with
back in '91, was an underground warehouse party thrown by the notorios 
Mike G in 1990...and who were the headliners?...none other than Lady Miss
Kier and Super DJ Dimitry...it wuz this first grand daddy family o club kids 
from which almost all the other family o club kids/raver kids spawned 
from...the second significant part that Lady Miss Kier played in the expansion
of the rave scene, is the part she played in a major party out on the east
coast in 1994 called 'Emerald Forest' thrown by Lonnie of Ultraworld...
Dee-Lite was the headlining act for that party...that party also drew nearly
9000 kids and at the time it wuz the largest attended party on the east 
coast ever...many, many ravers from the east coast (and the midwest
actually) was introduced to the scene at that party...without Dee-Lite that
party would never had as much draw as it did...

what it basically comes down to is: respect....respect for the elders...dats
it

Yeah he does!  Forreal, this dude knows how to spin a "mind intense"
set if I've ever heard one.  I've only heard him once at the party the
day after chirstmas, and it was incredible.  I remember hearing some
pink floyd in there and all sorts of other shit too.  I've never heard
a set like that played ever before ever.

You were just asking what letter of PLUR that event stands for . . . .
now the question I ask you is the same: what letter of PLUR does your
post stand for?  You shouldn't criticize people for doing one thing
and then do it yourself.

Well,
    You wanted it, you got it.  Tonight as our opening number, Circuit
6 will drop "Da' RSP Theme Song", pressed freshly on a type II tape
this afternoon, with a recent relick by the one like ABSOLUT.  Samples
have been added to fit the occasion perfectly.  Let's just hope they
don't make us start the song before everybody enters so that you can
hear it :)  I'd say arrive as early as possible so you can catch it. 
Hopefully they'll let you in early.

just for the record.....
The decision to do this in a venue that holds 100 people was mine.
Keoki is in town to hang out and relax.  He's not here to work.  He's
certainly not here for $$$.
If this was about $$$ this event would be at Trilogy, or U4ia, or better yet,
the skating rink or Rascal House. This isn't about exclusion, or elitism.  It
is about having FUN.
Rob: "Hey, Keoki, how bout we do a tiny show at my Tuesday bar"
Keoki:  "Cool...how small is it?"
Rob: "only fits a hundred"
Keoki: "cool, that will be a blast.  I haven't played a bar in ages"
            "is it a fun crowd?"
Rob:  "We'll make it so. I've got a great idea"

Again, MY DECISION.  MY IDEA.  MY PARTY
If I knew so many kids would get so freaked out by this, I wouldn't have
bothered.
I genuinely believed that this was one of the coolest things we could do  for
you 
guys.  Apparently, some of you just don't get it.
If this were a larger, more open-minded city, 1000 people would line up
outside hoping to pay as much as $30.00 to be a part of an intimate party like
this.
Again, Cleveland doesn't get it, and "beats me down"
To those who are coming....see you there.  I promise this will be an amazing
time.
To those who are offended.....

lying to your parents, throwing traditional musical constructs out the
window, breaking and entering, breaking the laws....

sounds like respect for the elders to me.

respect for the elders has never been a part of this scene (respect for each
other is the R in PLUR).

respect for the elders will destroy the CHANGE that this scene causes.
respect for the elders is what creates TRADITION that causes people to do
things 'just because' or because 'it's always done that way' and to do
things without thinking them out for themselves--individually.  just because
you are old, just because you have been around does not preclude you from
having to change and adapt.  you can choose not to, but before long you'll
be jamming to the tunes on the 'oldies' station (i did this this passed
weekend when the radio station 107.9 in cleveland had a 'flash back weekend'
and i knew almost every song, almost every word).

so rob sherwood, stevie t, lady miss kier, and keoki have been around for a
long time relative to the scene today...so what?  does that change their
music?  does that change their message?  no.  (it also does not prevent them
from growing, perpetuating changes or from staying fresh and new)

not to trash this event, it could be quite intimate and cool...but the
reasons i've seen expressed here about *why* it would be so intimate and
cool just seem all screwy to me.

> Rob:  "We'll make it so. I've got a great idea"

i think it's a cool idea to purposely select a tiny crowd for a huge name!

i'm not sure that i think letting the dj select the crowd is a lot of fun,
but that's just because it's keoki.  and that's just my opinion...maybe i'm
just jealous ;)

i can only compare something like this to getting to see the beastie boys in
a 150 person club with no advertisement (except word of mouth through the
underground).  seems like a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing that's brewing.

This past Sunday was THE BEST!  Lotsa food, fun and folks I knew from 
the list!  There was Frankie G and Todd, Dave, Geoffrey, Jenifer, 
Michael (of course Jenifer and Michael, they HAD to be there, it was 
their party after all!) Trouty came too! My dad even got a free tour of 
the house.

If you have never seen the house, it is being all remodeled and is a 
perfect old mansion thing for loads of fun!  The cats were upstairs, or 
else they woulda gotten lost, the two grills were kept busy for all the 
food, and there were about 4 turntables and 2 mixers.  My friend Kristen 
finally showed, I was glad she got back into the scene, since having her 
baby.  Jonathan D'Angelo!  He is a cutey!  :)  I got
to see him before her boyfriend Dorian drove off.

Anyway Circuit 6 was on, great stuff!  Reliant, Me, WHO PLAYED THAT 
OBNOXIOUS 'HO MUSIC for that romantic couple on the sofa,  Dr. Cutup 
killing the cats with DAS HARDKORE!  That drum machine pad was cool for 
his set, and what else...Uh, Trouty brought out drum thing Nbr. 2!
Well, enough gadgets for one and all!

Let's see, oh, when in the backyard, we had nature study, ants, ants, 
and more ants, tankety tank tanks, (pill bugs? mealy bugs?) dunno, but 
tankety tank tank name came from a real old outdated Atari game me and 
my brother played and the tanks were making a tankety tank tank noise so 
hence what we call these bugs.  Saw a big worm that went into the 
radiator pipe. Old Radiators make the steps outside.  Talk about 
recycling!  Saw a big black moving spider, a spider in the wood pile and 
a couple of moths and a cabbage butterfly!  NATURE IS NICE!

Everyone seemed to have a good time, and I even put on my devil outfit 
for Kristen because I promised her I would since my set was appropriate, 
and besides I was celebrating her first time back!  She had a lot of 
fun!  So did I and I was stuffied!  Talked to my friend Brick, and I was 
glad to see him, and that was it!  Rain was coming and warnings for 
flood was a problem, but I made it home safe and so did Kristen!  Thanks 
Michael and Jenifer for a great fun party, as usual!  Peace out, play 
for you soon?

DJ K.A.L.I.  Everyone seemed to like the puffy cheeze crackers I bought!  
Right guys?  :)  yum!

yup yup... i ate half the bag! cheese nip air crisps in da house.

yeah, the hausparty was really fun. nice day, nice music, nice people,
nice space drum, nice boca burgers... it was all good. we cut up for
about 45 minutes w/ 2 copies of when the levee breaks (like they do @
the beginning of rhymin + stealin) - that was a good bit of fun. there
were 5 turntables and 3 mixers - not bad! the sound setup was a wee
bit funky, but it sounded great. i'm all for more shit like this -
hopefully seth's gig in the park will happen. that's funny how the
same headz showed up that did @ spike's party (we missed ya, spike! i
even brought your zip disk). hopefully we can get even more peeps to
the next one. shouts out to everybody i was chillin with (i'm not
gonna list anyone cause i'll forget people, and then they'd be sad,
but you all know who you are... even if i dont :)

Bingo.

Oldschool.  Elitism.  The way it used to be.

It's all bullshit.

Think about what first drew you in to this.  The newness.  How
dynamic everything seemed.  Everything was fresh.  It had a luster
to it.  Now, a while later... why does everything seem so stale?

	"...now we've got to reach out and push ourselves, we've
	got to push it again or we're all going to keep on in the
	past and not move forward."
					- R. Hawtin

What needs to be done is new things need to be created.  New ideas.
New people.  New directions.  "It's gotta' stay fresh, yo."

So many people.  So much energy, enthusiasm, and hope.  And still,
it's the same thing, week after week.  What started with no
intentions whatsoever, grew into something that clamored to be a
movement, and now seems to have fallen on its proverbial haunches to
be just some sort of music/drug scene.

Pick up where things left off and run with it, fucker.  Quit looking
back.  What are we really doing this for, anyway.. and who?

It can be a lot more.  

Cast down the old gods.  Respect is one thing, blind obedience and
servitude to something that provided but doesn't provide is another.
Things become more when you demand them to be...

hell yeah, i've got a million and one wonderful accesories and tops and such

 <not trying to be ill in any way to anyone . . . just stating the facts>
 Ummm . . . maybe you haven't noticed, but many ravers are MAD fashion
 conscious and go out and spend $70 on a brand new shirt just because
 it says "Tommy Hilfiger" REALLY big down the sleeve or something
 similar.  The big pants (pretty much the symbol of a raver) cost about
 $50 a pair. >>

actually, i've seen (and had my mom buy =^)   $95 dollar pants....now i would
never myself pay for such a rediculous price, but hey, if my mom wants to
waist her money, no complaints here........

ok, but my of replying to this is, that i've noticed others do this too...but
its really much much cheaper to just make you own pants......you can buy cheap
goodwill pants and make them phat with inserts (sp?)  and/or one of my
personal favorites is to make pairs, of all bought material....you can make
the neatest designs and they always fit just right ....but anyway, just
thought i'd spit htat out at u all......chew well

What is wrong with AOL?  I know some AOL call letters that are fun to
talk to just like any of the other call letters like Netscape, Yahoo,
and God knows what else...I mean nothing wrong with that.

Thing is, I sorta wish I could have the Internet at home.  I wouldn't 
have to walk in crappy weather, being a target for all that lightning
(sob) and got trudgey up a steeeep hill, just to see who in the world 
posted what and if I got any friends who wrote me,  (Your crying right 
now I bet 'cause this is very sad coming up)  plus I ONLY HAVE 1/2 HOUR!

WAAAHHHH!  BOO HOO WE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! SOB THIS IS SOOOOO SAD!
sniff sob, snff!  And I use Netscape 'cause it is free and I am still 
Unemployed and going to Temps to see if they can get anything for me, 
but most want Data Entry or Telemarketing as the biggie job. :(

THAT IS SAD!  YOU'D BE GRATEFUL TO GET ANY OLD DAMN THING!  POOR K.
SHE SO PO' SHE AIN'T GOT NO INTERNET!, SHE AIN'T GOT NO CAR!  All she
got is lousy GEMSOUNDS with the pitch control upside down!  She ain't
got nothin'!  Hell, she'd be darn ecstatic if she had AOL like all those 
other folks, or maybe a Netscape, or a Yahoo!  She so po' she can't 
afford to be particular like everyone else!  

So be grateful out there, you could be like K. and have Gemsounds, and 
Radio Shack pulling you through, with NO INTERNET and NO CAR, but still 
somehow that girl makes it to parties.  Me!  uh nobody... nobody
at all....

Well, what the.... Hey!  Did you write this?  Yeah you!  Git!  Shoo!
My message!  SCAT!  Dude, whad' you do?  Is the original message still 
on here?  Huh?  ok.

DJ K.A.L.I. and my pal Tankety Tank Tank  
(Go on, go play in the back yard like all the other tankety tank tanks
their waitin' for ya.)

I just saw your note about the Krishnas and it seemed right.  I think by
"unassuming life" he is just saying that it would be just fine to live a life
that is simple and not worrying about all the things that he worried about.  I
believe he thought that you should live life simlply and not be on the bodily
platform because it allows you to think clearly and have a higher
consciousness.  I believe that Einstien refrained from eating meat for the very
same reason, maybe he thought it lowered his conscoiusness.
Let me know what you think.  What are your beliefs?
respectz,
kd

yeah well, I've got respect for the work that they did in the past, but 
that doesn't mean that I like the garbage that they're putting out  
now... nothing more sad than a star who's past their peak and resting on 
their past achievements

ALL DJ's and "music makers"

Twitch Transmissions is still looking for DJs and other electronic musicians 
for our weekly webcast of experimental/dark sound experiments....see the 
original message below for the details:

ATTENTION ALL DJS!!!!!!

recently i've become part of a new webcasting start-up called Media Bureau. my 
partner and i have a weekly time slot coming up of 8pm til 12am every sunday. 
we've named it twitch transmissions and it's going to be devoted to 
experimental music of ALL types...

so here's the reason for the post: we need djs. we need ALL KINDS OF 
DJS...preferrably those who are on a more experimental tip. we're not sure of 
the details yet, but i can tell you up front that you probably won't get paid. 
i know that i'm not getting any money for this, so i'm asking for the support 
of the people who make music on these lists. we're looking for dark music. 
regardless of the genre you happen to spin, this is the chance to be completely 
experimental and not have to worry about stopping the dancefloor....anyone who 
spins deathcore should get in touch with me IMMEDIATELY. again, we are looking 
for experimental music. if you're interested in being part of one of the most 
experimental, weekly, live webcasts, then get in touch with me...

Media Bureau will start it's first webcast on June 28...check out the site: 
www.mediabureau.com. twitch transmissions should have it's virgin webcast 
within a month....sometime in july, we're hoping....this isn't some pipe dream, 
THIS WILL HAPPEN...so get in touch with us ASAP...

peace
-john

ps: anyone know how to get in touch with Jon The Dentist?

i think it's most fun to steal the expensive clothes. i mean, the designers
are stealing from you anyway. i think we should get them back. <revolting>

<< FAMILY AFFAIR NET UPDATE 6/30/98
 ****************************************
 Okay folks, here's the official scoop.. 
 
 mutha nature has dumped a buncha rain on our old spot, and yes the old
 venue is indeed underwater. the owner was navigating his land in a boat
 yesterday. since we all dont have boats, we secured a new venue (bigger and
 better!)
 
 we got showers, we got power, we got real bathrooms!
 
 The new venue is called Alpine Music Park, located near Sugarcreek Ohio
 (only 1.5 hours south of cleveland!) its alot closer to everything, and
 alot further from West Virginia.

I dunno about u but I feel the flooding wuz a message from up above to keep it
in North East Ohio forever.I am so glad I can go now this year
  
       peace and love

This is all well and good. and i did mean over rated not underrated, I still
think it is bullshit though, and i know alot of people who would agree with
me. i just feel bad for that person who has always wanted to see him and stood
in line for hours and was not deemed cool enough by him to get in.

Just my opinion,
Jason

Well rest easy buddy, I just got back from there, and I don't think 
he had 100 people to choose from :)  I don't think anybody was 
refused admittance.  Anyways, I had a *great* time, I personaly 
thought keoki rocked, especially in such a tight little space! Most 
of the people in the room were at least groovin if not dancin, and 
the floor was open enough that I could dance pretty wide and freely 
:)  I even saw bitter ole' StevieT throw down a time or two! (Sorry I 
didn't say hey,  was havin too much fun dancin!)  I don't think I saw 
any listmembers aside from Stevie, and a girl who was with him that 
for some reason I am thinking may have been AmyFuNkyBiZz?  Am I 
right? =P  Anywas...off to bed..must work early in the 
morn...grrrr...

Oh ya, casey - where wuz you at? I had a tape for 
you...rrrrrrrrrrrrrrobert dela gauthier! :) ohwell

Chris
