Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Yeah, I think Matt had to break in with bolt cutters to that back
space just to keep the party going after that country club got shut.=20
I believe that was the Miricles party.  I practically lived down there
at the attick, every weekend. Good times, Good times!

Even when it got raided back then, the police really did not know what
they had stepped into.  They were freaked out at the bizare underworld
they had found.  They were really looking for someones underage
daughter because the parent complained.  I doubt anything could
survive under the radar that long these days unless everyone adopted
fight club rules 1 and 2.

Speaking of those poeple from then.  Chris Pulse just got married in
May.  Hes still resident up at LAVA I think.  Mike Sparx moved to
Phoenix several years ago.  Haven't seen Synapse in a few years, but I
think hes still down in Akron somewhere.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Thu Jun 02                         DJ RAP                        Cincinnati

Before emerging from the drum'n'bass underground for a major-label 
recording contract in 1997, DJ Rap was long one of the best mixers in 
the business, as well as one of jungle's best (if understated) 
producers. Born Charissa Saverio in Singapore, she spent her childhood 
living in various exotic locales around the world (her stepfather was a 
luxury-hotel manager) before settling in Southampton, England as a 
teenager. While studying to be a solicitor, Saverio became involved with 
the British rave scene and soon graduated from clubkid to working as a 
producer and mixer. Among her first released tracks was 1990's 
underground breakbeat favorite "The Adored" (as Ambience), recorded with 
Jeff B. and released on Raw Bass Records. She learned how to mix while 
promoting a record on the East London pirate station Rave FM, and made 
her reputation a few years later after standing in for Fabio for a 
last-minute slot at the Astoria. Rap continued to produce and launched 
several hardcore/jungle classics of the early '90s, including Engineers 
Without Fears' "Spiritual Aura," recorded with Aston Harvey (later of 
the Sol Brothers and Freestylers). DJ Rap formed her own mixing agency, 
spinning it into the Proper Talent record label as well. Signed to 
Sony's Higher Ground subsidiary in 1997, she released her first album 
Learning Curve two years later. The mix album Brave New World (a 
co-headlining gig with Kenny Ken) followed in 2000, and the combination 
mix-album/production-collection Propa Classics appeared one year later. 
Rap's next CD release was another mix album, the double-disc set 
Touching Bass on Surge

Wish Nightclub is excited to announce coming back to Cleveland for the 
June 4th T&G:

MAZI (Gourmet/NRK, Chicago)

If house music is truly global music, then US DJ/Producer Mazi Namvar is 
a model citizen. Born in Iran, and living in Greece, China, Japan, and 
Germany, before halting permanently in Chicago, where he currently 
resides. Involved in Chicago.s house scene since the early 90.s and 
releasing his first record in 1994, Mazi has released a wide range of 
music. Recording as Studio nova, MFO, Right Side Reverse, and most 
famously as Audio Soul Project, he.s credited with over 100 singles and 
remixes, and a full length album on NRK titled .Community.. From His 
remixes of Superfunk.s .Lucky Star., Joey Negro, and Donna Blakely to 
deep, tracky house on labels like 20/20, NRK, Airtight, and his own 
Gourmet imprint, Mazi.s work represents nearly every strand of 
contemporary house. Taking his studio sensibility, his DJ career has 
quickly elevated itself within the international scene. Behind the 
decks, his "journey" style sets have steadily garnered him a reputation

In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who later became known as the X-ecutioners. 
Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made 
their reputation by utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the 
manual alteration between individual kick and snare sounds to create 
original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes 
in some of the premier DJ battles; (first place in the 1991 "As One"; 
second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an 
episode of "Saturday Night Live"; (the first DJ to ever) has made him an 
american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hop’s 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such

their rendition of BT's "The Great Escape". Their most recent remix 
collaboration had them working with BT to create: BT vs The Doors "Break 
on Through (To the Other Side)..

Their signature tracks have been heavily supported by the likes of Paul 
Oakenfold, BT, Deepsky, Hybrid and DJ Icey to name a few. Likewise,

Sun Jun 19                         JOHN B                        Pittsburgh

Focused Motives

Sunday Jun 19, 2005 at 7:0

Prana Gallery
2010 Smallman st
Pittsburgh, PA 15222

Another rocking night brought to you by Focused Motives

John B . If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical 
guises over the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at 
a young age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the 
most eclectic and unique individuals working within electronic music 
today. Consistently escaping categorization, John s genre-defying 
catalogue spans the worlds of Electro, tr**ce and Drum & Bass, and a few 
other spaces across the bpm spectrum.
John.s career began in illustrious style as the one and only Goldie 
picked up on this mild-mannered, blonde-locked science graduate and his 
distinctive drum and bass beat constructions, and he was signed to the 
legendary Metalheadz label. Tracks such as the euphoric Up All Night 
have become instant classics in the canon of drum and bass, and 
repeatedly smashed dancefloors worldwide. John B quickly became a 
headlining name on flyers across the globe, and his touring schedule has 
been non-stop ever since. Establishing his own stable of labels (Beta 
Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse 
tastes from liquid funk to Latin, provided the perfect platform for John 
s groundbreaking sonic experimentation to develop.
>From his studio and label HQ in Maidenhead, UK, John has since made 
major waves within the wider world of dance music. Having picked up on 
John s early forays into trance production, Perfecto label boss and DJ 
superstar Paul Oakenfold commissioned tracks which ended up alongside 
the likes of Madonna and Justin Timberlake on the epic Great Wall 
compilation. John has also long worn his love of 80s electronica on his 
sleeve, way before the fashionistas jumped on the bandwagon, and he has 
been busy signing hot new electro-influenced tracks for his most recent 
label venture, Nu Electro. There is also rumoured to be a John B 
reworking of Toni Basil.s classic Hey Mickey in the pipeline.
Still just the tender age of 26, is there is much more to come from Mr 
B. Next up, godfather of soul James Brown.s new tracks are due for the 
John B remix treatment, a real surprise for even this musical chameleon. 
He s also been busy Remixing Howard Jones, Heaven 17, Digital Nation, 
Robbie Craig and S.Express. True to form, it doesn.t seem as if things 
will be becoming predictable any time soon.

DJ Tanner - Dj Tanner is no stranger to the Pittsburgh electronic music 
scene. Shortly after making his mark at Trainwreck Tuesday.s , DJ Tanner 
went on to co-found Full House Productions, throwing some of the most 
banging EDM nights in Pittsburgh.
With early trance and house influences there is no question why his 
genre of choice is progressive. Armed with his melodic mixing and unique 
programming, Tanner touches a vast variety of genres ranging from 
progressive house, breaks, techno and tech-house. His goal. crowd 
response. Rest ashore, Tanner will flex his muscle and show Pittsburgh 
an impressive display of his eclectic taste in music.

DJ NatasK . Born Joseph Kodba, Graduate of Mercyhurst College with a 
degree in Electronic Communications. DJ NatasK started throwing parties 
with his partner Anthony Lang, as Mynespent Productions. After much 
success and his strong faction of supporters the collaboration threw 
Genesis, their first large scale party featuring some of Pittsburgh.s

JAIA (Digital Structures . France) LIVE!
The act JAIA is the project of  the French producer Yannis Kamarinos, 
formed in 1995 with Jean-Michel Blanchet and first oriented  Psy-Trance 
and Downtempo.  Since 2000 Yannis is working alone under JAIA name,  and 
today JAIA.s music is more orientated to Progressive House and 
Progressive Trance (and still Downtempo too).  JAIA has already released 
an album .Blue Energy. in 1998 (Cross/EastWest/Nova Tekk), which has 
been re-released in 2000 on the Japanese label Dakini.  JAIA released 
several 12" singles too, as well as numerous tracks on various label 
compilations, such as  Island, Iboga, Wagram, Milan, Flying Rhino, 
T.I.P. World, and many others.  The new album "Fiction" will be released 
in May 2005 on Digital Structures.  Yannis has collaborated with other 
producers-DJ.s such as DADO, WIZY NOISE, and SILICON SOUND.  He has 
remixed famous artists like the French singer MYLENE FARMER . including 
her last two singles "C.est Une Belle Journée" and "Pardonne-Moi"

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

Sat Jul 23                   LAWNCHAIR GENERALS                   Cleveland

Coming to Wish Saturday July 23rd

LawnChair Generals (Viva, Westbound, Lowdown)

Seattle transplants Peter Christianson and Carlos Mendoza, better known 
as the Lawnchair Generals, have been generating beats out of their 
self-made studio for the past two years. Based on the brief amount of 
time the duo has spent manning the controls, the success they have 
attained is staggering. As goes the old adage, it is quality, not 
quantity that breeds such success; along with their blinding talent, 
both behind the decks and in the studio, and a little luck thrown in for 
good measure, the Generals have blazed their way into the record crates 
of the world's top DJs and onto internationally distributed mixes 
compiled by the industry's most prolific jocks. "The egalitarian nature 
of this industry is what allows us to completely transcend the fact that 
we're from a town that has been mostly rock oriented," says Carlos. "It 
allows us to be on equal footing with people who have been making great 
house music for a long time."

Lawn Chair Generals likely represent the next creative event in 
underground house music, a sound carefully crafted unlike much of the 
slapped together economy of the dance music prevelant to date. Carlos 
Mendoza and Peter Christianson met in 2000 and almost immediatelly began 
experimenting with the possibilities of house music. Their very first 
experiment yielded their first release on Viva Recordings, "The Great 
Escape". The pair was pleasantly surprised when this release garnered 
the praise of national and worldwide heavyweights alike. Charted in 
publications by the likes of Mark Farina and Colin Dale of the BBC, and 
broken out on dance floors by Johnny Fiasco, DJ Heather, Doc Martin, Rob 
Mello and more all over the world, their "West Coast meets Chicago" 
sound has garnered this pair more attention than they expected...Remixes 
for Viva, Deepfunk and Amenti extend this duo's sound to the works of 
other emerging underground talents such as Hanna, Rhythm Slaves and 
Alexander East.

Bailey
[[[Metalheadz, 1Xtra, Swerve, Intasound]]]
UK

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the 
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats 
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey.s South London 
stomping ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, 
DJing at house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the 
mellow hip hop of the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and 
harder; Acid House . the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the 
rave scene. It was on this acid house path, in around .91 that he found 
a turning for hardcore, inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of 
this road he entered the door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate 
station .Energy FM.. It was his ability on that very station that 
impressed Kemistry and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play 
at one of the first Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. 
Through moving on the circuit Bailey joined forces with other 
influential South London selectors and MC.s, forming the Inta Natty crew 
which consisted of himself, Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known 
for managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin. Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm 
and Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by 
playing in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, 
Canada, America and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has 
been all over the mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some 
of which include: One Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric 
Live, The End, Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldie.s club 
Metalheadz and Fabio.s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people 
want has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting 
line up, every Sunday night (11pm . 1am) and in 2003 he won the award 
for .Best Radio Show. at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for 
many projects including mixed CD.s for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of 
Sound, France.s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass 
record store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size 
& A Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja 
and in 2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing 
tracks from cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he 
has the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an 
impression and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ.s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to . 
recognition and respect.

As most of you already know, The Mattress Company Arts Center is gone.  
An electrical fire burned out beloved building and all of its contents 
to the ground in under an hour, leaving 4 people homeless and 3 others 
without a place to do business.

In an effort to help these folks, we are organizing a benefit on Friday 
May 27th at Cedar's starting at 8 pm and going through to 2 am.  The 
best of the best in the Youngstown music scene have already signed on 
to perform, we currently have 5 bands scheduled.  We are also going to 
be holding a Chinese Auction of artwork from the pool of amazing 
artists in Youngstown.  The auction will begin on Friday night and end 
on Sunday afternoon at 4 pm with a drawing to be held at Cedar's Cafe 
and the winners need not be present.  All proceeds will go to the 
victims of  the fire.  The Chinese auction is an excellent chance to 
pick up some really fantastic artwork as the YMCAC held a special place 
in the hearts of Youngstown artists and we are all donating some truly 
spectacular pieces.

There will be a minimum $5 donation at the door on Friday night 
although people are encouraged to donate as much as they would like.  
These folks need things like toothbrushes, shoes, clothing, etc.  
Nothing was saved from the building and all they have are the clothes 
they were wearing.  If you have clothing that you don't wear anymore, 
donations are welcomed at the benefit.

There will be updates on the event at http://www.sarabella.net/blog 
with info on the bands playing and the artists participating in the 
auction.

Subject: {pb-cle} Jobs and stuff?

So pretty much I graduated college a month ago and I don't know if any
other graduates have felt or feel the same if you have recently
graduated; but my brain feels like its dying.  I need to find a job
that is somehow related to my BA in Studio art.  (Don't laugh!) I was
wondering if there are any leads in the pb-cle area?  Maybe I can get
some resumes polished up, head up there and get something happenin'.=20
Kentucky sucks by the way, just in case you were wondering.

Thanx!

i notice that a lot of people on myspace consider realness the *most*

trait when meeting new people.  i assume they're talking about the

offensive headlines telling you to fuck off unless you can list their

this years festival featured some insane acts...

but when you have the chance to hear: UR live, Model
500 Live,DJ Traxx among others... and the choices here
are Misstress Barbara, and Ben Simms..you know, the
people that play at every pb-cle rave...something is
VERY wrong.

Subject: {pb-cle} Mazi :: June 4 :: Wish Nightclub

Nobody's posted this yet, so I though I'd send it
along...

Wish Nightclub is excited to announce coming back to
Cleveland for the June 4th T&G:


MAZI (Gourmet/NRK, Chicago)


If house music is truly global music, then US
DJ/Producer Mazi Namvar is a model citizen. Born in
Iran, and living in Greece, China, Japan, and Germany,
before halting permanently in Chicago, where he
currently resides. Involved in Chicago’s house scene
since the early 90’s and releasing his first record in
1994, Mazi has released a wide range of music.
Recording as Studio nova, MFO, Right Side Reverse, and
most famously as Audio Soul Project, he’s credited
with over 100 singles and remixes, and a full length
album on NRK titled “Community”. From His remixes of
Superfunk’s “Lucky Star”, Joey Negro, and Donna
Blakely to deep, tracky house on labels like 20/20,
NRK, Airtight, and his own Gourmet imprint, Mazi’s
work represents nearly every strand of contemporary
house. Taking his studio sensibility, his DJ career
has quickly elevated itself within the international
scene. Behind the decks, his "journey" style sets have
steadily garnered him a reputation as a true taste
maker on the dance floor. Mazi is regularly found in
cities such Paris, London, Singapore, Zurich, Tokyo,
Istanbul, Belgrade, Ibiza, Vancouver, Vienna, Rio,
Argentina, Peru, Los Angeles, New York, and San
Francisco.

Ken Ishii was definitely worth the whole festival and some change and a hal=
f.
I thought Mistress Barbara was very good.  My favorite by far had to
be Ben Sims and Carl Craig.  Julius "the mad thinker" was also good if
you are into that real deep house/broken beat tip.  His mixing wasn't
all that, but his tracks were swe..incredible as Napoleon Dynamite
would say.  Actually "frickin' incredible".

wow, i've heard about adam x playing good stuff, but of the dozen or so 
times i've seen him, that's only happened once, and he was playing this 
industrial techno type stuff, which was NOT par for the course for 
him.   it's usually sleepy time techno.  i've watched him kill a bumpin 
party too many times to even want to go when he's on the lineup.

<< makes it hard to tell when you suck.  >>
 
So be it, but this is what it was and sounded like  then.  This dood was 
making and spinning "techno" (this goes for  Keoki too) in warehouse parties in 
Cleveland and Akron
when most of you little bottle sucking pin heads were just getting your  
first hard-ons.
Looks like you still don't know what to do with them.
 
I saw Adam-X (aka X-Crash) live at the Lift, or was it Smart bar? years ago  
with a 909
and a 303.  Yea, it was a little raw.  But I still give him props  for doing 
it.
 
I think him and his crew rolled into town, literally, for a party Adam and  
Jay threw there.
The old owners of "the fun house" at the Metropolis.
 
You make me sick with your disrespect for the culture and history.
 
Get some school fool.
 
Know you roots bitches.  THEN talk shit.
 
This is techno.

Yeah dont care for him overall....but at DEMF a few years ago...um the
year Autechre played, what 2001 or something like that?....he played at
the afterhours eyes only...with Dopplereffekt and Ultradyne.&nbsp; He
played all dark hard electro and it was really really good.&nbsp; My
recording came out way clipped because I was getting into it and
standing too dancing too close to the speakers.<br>

> http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/troll.htm


all these years, i've been going about running this list the wrong way,
thanks for the heads up!!!   :)

"Domination Trolls
Recently, it has become apparent that there are probably trolls also
operating as list managers. I am unclear as to the specific motivations
for this type of activity, but it may be:

* gratification from dominating the emotional lives of list members
* gangland ware - where one group sets up a list and aims to defend it
from other trolling groups
* a genuine area of interest on behalf of the troll"

yeah, in louisville he played dark grindy industrial techno, it was really

Well, technically, there's still an OT list (bsp) http://pb-cle- 
ot.lists.vrillusions.com/ (/bsp) for all non rave related stuff.  But  
with all the shit talking on here, that list is pretty much dead.   
But yeah this list gets really boring when everyone takes their meds  
and chill out for a week.

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP: Charleston, WV 6-10-05 @ The Pour House

Wazzzup peeps!  I've been invited as a special guest DJ this Friday at the Pour
House Sports Bar in Charleston, West Virginia.  This sports bar is 21 and over
(sorry for some of ya... I'll make it up one day.) I'd bring $5 in case there's
a cover at the door (which may be $3)--I have only seen a cover once when there
was a band present.  If you're a drunk, the drinks are dirt cheap.  Bring about
$20 and rest assured you'll be trashed!  The place has a main dance floor, a
second room consisting of a regular bar setup, and an outdoor patio which is
not a bad size at all.  I will arrive no later than 9pm to setup with the
resident DJ, "Wimpy".

Just between all of us, Friday Night will be very interesting and entertaining
for the Coach.  Wimpy has been blasting my mix CD I hooked him up with at this
club for the past two weeks.  I checked it out first hand last week and not
only did he call me out to the crowd like I was damn celebrity or something, he
blasted the CD again. The crowd dug it.  They just bounced up and down & grinded
each other (that's all they can do--bless their po' country-ass hearts).  It
bought a tear to my eye.

Anyway, if you plan on being in the Charleston/Huntington area this Friday, drop
on by the Pour House.  It lives up to its name!  The directions are not
difficult.  Just Google Search the Pour House--4030 West Washington Street,
Charleston WV! Peace out!!

You mean the Europe Gyro. They used to throw weeklies there back from '94 through '96. Actully the first time I ever tried to  la doche vita it outside of cleveland was 2 cars/ 13 people deep out to the gyro and it happened to be the first day in area history a weeklie night ID'd at the door. Of course we where all 15-17 so it was a botched mission ;)

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who later became known as the X-ecutioners. 
Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made 
their reputation by utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the 
manual alteration between individual kick and snare sounds to create 
original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes 
in some of the premier DJ battles; (first place in the 1991 "As One"; 
second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an 
episode of "Saturday Night Live"; (the first DJ to ever) has made him an 
american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hop’s 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such 
exotic locations as Singapore, Turkey, Japan and Australia. Roc Raida is 
considered among the best of the contemporary DJ's and has brought the 
underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.

DEEP PROGRESSIVE TECHNOLOGY

Amidst the thousands of artists and producers that work in the EDM 
industry today, Curtis and Leaha are of the few who strive to create 
truly original musical compositions. The live Progressive Breakbeat duo 
has been shredding the airwaves, dance floors, and club scene with their 
exceptional productions and intense performances. Their impeccable 
fusion of harmonious melodies and earth shaking beats creates a unique 
style and sound that cannot be matched.

Burufunk is best known for their chart topping remixes which include: BT 
"Somnambulist" (Nettwerk), Deepsky "Talk like a Stranger" (Yoshi Toshi), 
and Wrecked Angle "Back to Babylon" (Electrofly) which had remained in 
the Balance Record Pool top 20 for more than ten weeks. They were also 
recognized as one of the winners in the BPM Magazine Remix Contest for 
their rendition of BT's "The Great Escape". Their most recent remix 
collaboration had them working with BT to create: BT vs The Doors "Break 
on Through (To the Other Side)..

Their signature tracks have been heavily supported by the likes of Paul 
Oakenfold, BT, Deepsky, Hybrid and DJ Icey to name a few. Likewise, 
their first release together "Outsider" was featured on Global 
Underground 024 'Reykjavik' mixed by Nick Warren. Look to Godsend Music 
for more Burufunk material launching this summer as well as an upcoming 
album in the works.

So much can be said about these visionaries... but their music is 
something words cannot express.

John.s career began in illustrious style as the one and only Goldie 
picked up on this mild-mannered, blonde-locked science graduate and his 
distinctive drum and bass beat constructions, and he was signed to the 
legendary Metalheadz label. Tracks such as the euphoric Up All Night 
have become instant classics in the canon of drum and bass, and 
repeatedly smashed dancefloors worldwide. John B quickly became a 
headlining name on flyers across the globe, and his touring schedule has 
been non-stop ever since. Establishing his own stable of labels (Beta 
Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse 
tastes from liquid funk to Latin, provided the perfect platform for John 
s groundbreaking sonic experimentation to develop.
>From his studio and label HQ in Maidenhead, UK, John has since made 
major waves within the wider world of dance music. Having picked up on 
John s early forays into trance production, Perfecto label boss and DJ 
superstar Paul Oakenfold commissioned tracks which ended up alongside 
the likes of Madonna and Justin Timberlake on the epic Great Wall 
compilation. John has also long worn his love of 80s electronica on his 
sleeve, way before the fashionistas jumped on the bandwagon, and he has 
been busy signing hot new electro-influenced tracks for his most recent 
label venture, Nu Electro. There is also rumoured to be a John B 
reworking of Toni Basil.s classic Hey Mickey in the pipeline.
Still just the tender age of 26, is there is much more to come from Mr 
B. Next up, godfather of soul James Brown.s new tracks are due for the 
John B remix treatment, a real surprise for even this musical chameleon. 
He s also been busy Remixing Howard Jones, Heaven 17, Digital Nation, 
Robbie Craig and S.Express. True to form, it doesn.t seem as if things 
will be becoming predictable any time soon.

DJ Tanner - Dj Tanner is no stranger to the Pittsburgh electronic music 
scene. Shortly after making his mark at Trainwreck Tuesday.s , DJ Tanner 
went on to co-found Full House Productions, throwing some of the most 
banging EDM nights in Pittsburgh.
With early trance and house influences there is no question why his 
genre of choice is progressive. Armed with his melodic mixing and unique 
programming, Tanner touches a vast variety of genres ranging from 
progressive house, breaks, techno and tech-house. His goal. crowd 
response. Rest ashore, Tanner will flex his muscle and show Pittsburgh 
an impressive display of his eclectic taste in music.

DJ NatasK . Born Joseph Kodba, Graduate of Mercyhurst College with a 
degree in Electronic Communications. DJ NatasK started throwing parties 
with his partner Anthony Lang, as Mynespent Productions. After much 
success and his strong faction of supporters the collaboration threw 
Genesis, their first large scale party featuring some of Pittsburgh.s 
hottest dj.s. This truly was a Genesis, starting his adventure of DJing 
and promoting! After graduation, NatasK moved to Pittsburgh, pursuing a 
career as a photojournalist for KDKA TV. Soon there after 
SubsurfaceTribe was created and over the first year in Pittsburgh, 
traveled back to native Erie PA to run Generator with his partner DJ 
Nature and long time friend Iggy. Generator showcased talent from the 
entire tri-state region. During which he kept a monthly schedule of 
bookings from Ohio to upstate New York. Currently the Subsurfacetribe

JAIA (Digital Structures . France) LIVE!
The act JAIA is the project of  the French producer Yannis Kamarinos, 
formed in 1995 with Jean-Michel Blanchet and first oriented  Psy-Trance 
and Downtempo.  Since 2000 Yannis is working alone under JAIA name,  and 
today JAIA.s music is more orientated to Progressive House and 
Progressive Trance (and still Downtempo too).  JAIA has already released 
an album .Blue Energy. in 1998 (Cross/EastWest/Nova Tekk), which has 
been re-released in 2000 on the Japanese label Dakini.  JAIA released 
several 12" singles too, as well as numerous tracks on various label

in May 2005 on Digital Structures.  Yannis has collaborated with other

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

everyone.

Last, local crews such as Nightvision and Full House represent most of
our local lineup for this event. Progressive House, break beats, techno,
all over the place, these crews will be sure to keep the crowd
movin...all night long.

Sat Jul 23                   LAWNCHAIR GENERALS                   Cleveland

Coming to Wish Saturday July 23rd

LawnChair Generals (Viva, Westbound, Lowdown)

Seattle transplants Peter Christianson and Carlos Mendoza, better known 
as the Lawnchair Generals, have been generating beats out of their 
self-made studio for the past two years. Based on the brief amount of 
time the duo has spent manning the controls, the success they have 
attained is staggering. As goes the old adage, it is quality, not 
quantity that breeds such success; along with their blinding talent, 
both behind the decks and in the studio, and a little luck thrown in for 
good measure, the Generals have blazed their way into the record crates 
of the world's top DJs and onto internationally distributed mixes 
compiled by the industry's most prolific jocks. "The egalitarian nature 
of this industry is what allows us to completely transcend the fact that 
we're from a town that has been mostly rock oriented," says Carlos. "It 
allows us to be on equal footing with people who have been making great 
house music for a long time."

Lawn Chair Generals likely represent the next creative event in 
underground house music, a sound carefully crafted unlike much of the 
slapped together economy of the dance music prevelant to date. Carlos 
Mendoza and Peter Christianson met in 2000 and almost immediatelly began 
experimenting with the possibilities of house music. Their very first 
experiment yielded their first release on Viva Recordings, "The Great 
Escape". The pair was pleasantly surprised when this release garnered 
the praise of national and worldwide heavyweights alike. Charted in 
publications by the likes of Mark Farina and Colin Dale of the BBC, and 
broken out on dance floors by Johnny Fiasco, DJ Heather, Doc Martin, Rob 
Mello and more all over the world, their "West Coast meets Chicago" 
sound has garnered this pair more attention than they expected...Remixes 
for Viva, Deepfunk and Amenti extend this duo's sound to the works of 
other emerging underground talents such as Hanna, Rhythm Slaves and 
Alexander East.

Bailey
[[[Metalheadz, 1Xtra, Swerve, Intasound]]]
UK

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the 
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats 
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey.s South London 
stomping ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, 
DJing at house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the 
mellow hip hop of the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and 
harder; Acid House . the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the 
rave scene. It was on this acid house path, in around .91 that he found 
a turning for hardcore, inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of 
this road he entered the door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate 
station .Energy FM.. It was his ability on that very station that 
impressed Kemistry and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play 
at one of the first Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. 
Through moving on the circuit Bailey joined forces with other 
influential South London selectors and MC.s, forming the Inta Natty crew 
which consisted of himself, Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known 
for managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin. Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm 
and Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by 
playing in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, 
Canada, America and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has 
been all over the mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some 
of which include: One Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric 
Live, The End, Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldie.s club 
Metalheadz and Fabio.s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people 
want has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting 
line up, every Sunday night (11pm . 1am) and in 2003 he won the award 
for .Best Radio Show. at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for 
many projects including mixed CD.s for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of 
Sound, France.s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass 
record store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size 
& A Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja 
and in 2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing 
tracks from cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he 
has the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an 
impression and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ.s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to . 
recognition and respect.

I agree...

If I remember correctly Real Audio was one of the first applications 
to allow streaming audio on the Internet (Remember the great sets on 
plus8.com/audio?).  I know that some like it because it has built in 
copy controls.  The actual player is almost like a trojan horse.  I 
installed it (several times with several versions) and it just makes 
my computer grind to a halt.

The player that Real puts out is definitely a pain.  There is an alternative
player that will play real audio files out there called Real Alternative,
its pretty minimal, plays most audio files.  Never had any problems with it
at all.

the k-lite mega codec pack with media player classic is also an option. 
so is mplayer, but it's not very user friendly.

k-lite mega codec pack installs all the files to play alot of different
formats without all the extra crap.  definately the way to go.

through the history of it all - techno, Chicago, Detroit, house, acid,
electro, even early hip-hop ‚ you name it, it's there. From the times then
European electronic music (KRAFTWERK!) infected black music and musicians
and inspired them to create something new till today. Compiled from a

Yeah I know most of you guys here can be myspace nerds, and having  
something else to look at is probably a hassle by now. I just thought this  
was interesting and different.. check it out..

www.catch27.com

Its basically like myspace, setting up a profile and all that crap... but  
youre trading your friends like baseball cards. The more you work  
yourself, the higher your card is worth. It's kinda wack if you ask me,  
but a friend of mine fucking got me started all ready.. ungh.

Here's an invite, if you feel like being nerdy for a few minutes.
Atleast you can delete yourself if you dont like it..

http://www.catch27.com/join.php?invite=25985

Been going through the site, and its hilarious.

So from what I understand, you can only have 27 people in your list. 
That's actually pretty dope compared to the people who have 
sixfuckinghundred people they've never actually met -- which is a joke 
and actually defeats the original purpose.

The whole thing looks pretty brutal so far, missing the candy coated 
hipster douchbag touch of friendster, and the horrendous page hack 
customizations and girls who think they can sing aspects of myspace. The 
fact that you actually trade people is kinda dope too, since the only 
other options of the other sites is to delete someone, its super that I 
can trade you for someone better if you piss me off. It's still the same 
"look at me" hipster BS that the others are, but the game aspect is 
pretty fun. Most of my friends would punch me in the face if I sent them 
an invite so its not entirely complete in that your "friends" list 
consists of people who love social networking sites.

Oh, and oops. I forgot to finish some of the invites I sent out  (hit 
enter too early).

Subject: {pb-cle}Mac questions....

Well I did it, I made the move to Mac and I have seen
the light for real. The thing is that when I had a PC
it was easy to get sofftware and I was familar with
everything. I am getting  the hang of it, slowly, but
I need soulseek and some other shit.. So are the warez
sites for mac? I noticed a thread about bit torrent,
is that just a P2P site also? 
I know quite a few of you use macs so please hook  up
some knowledge.

Bittorrent is a way to share files.  The client you might want to look
at is Azureus.

Soulseek only works for Windows.  pySoulseek is a hack that works on
Linux/Unix, and someone was working on SoulseeX as a native Mac port.

wow, there were alot of people out for this one.  most people i've seen
out in ohio in a long time.

it was in one of the creekway warehouses down there, the one with all the
graffiti inside.  it was pretty toasty in there, but not like that one
last year in one of those warehouses where it was closed up all night.

the music was so-so throughout the night but i could find something
between the rooms, the setup in the main room was crazy, VAST had 3
projected screens setup around the dj with a full color laser and a
shitload of lights.  totally badass stuff.

this is the first party in awhile i've seen so many people still around at
the end.

we tried hitting up this afterhours, but ended up at a house.  "300 person
capacity venue" my ass.   we couldn't get in, so just headed home.

i did meet face to face with a couple myspacers i've never met in person,
so that was cool too.

Subject: {pb-cle} Dylan @ FUZZ this wednesday!!!

FUZZ! - Practice safe sex - Go fuck yourself.
All your Drum and Bass are belong to us.

God Save The Queen.


DYLAN - (Freak Recordings - Renegade Hardware - Outbreak - Timeless -
United Kingdom)</b> - As the owner and operator of Freak Recordings, Dylan
has made himself into one of the household names in DNB. His styles range
from demented darkness/metal to ghetto funk. He's been at the top of the
scene now for quite some time, and will continue on until death do us
part. He has his roots in the electro era, scrounging up records and
mixing them on budget tables. Like many of the UK old heads, he evolved
into Hip Hop and finally into DNB in the mid 90s. He also dominated the
London Pirate radio scene show with the also legendary B Key for several
years. Shortly after, Dylan turned to the studios - borrowing money for
his production equipment. This lead to the debut of Kosmos Tighten Up and
Liquid Beats. He has since gone on to produce banger after banger,
including anthems such as Need You with Ink, TheInferno EP, Dominion and
Penitentary, to name a few. He's collaborated with the top names in the
biz, such as DJ Trace, Robyn Chaos, Technical Itch, Friction, and was one
of the Four Horsemen along with Loxy, Keaton, and Ink. He's been a
resident at some of the most noted UK DNB weeklies such as the Renegade
Hardware night at London's legendary The End. Upcoming releases on
Metalheadz and other top notch labels ensure that he'll stay on top for at
least another week or two.

RNDMTSK - (412DNB - Core Recordings) - After nearly 20 years of
combined DJ'ing, <b>FUZZ!</b> residents Midas & Alaska have discovered
their forte as producers. Starting with their remix of Pittsburghs own
GPK's (Reapa Records, UK) track The Saw Is Family due out on Core, and an
entire arsenal of home-grown on the way, these guys create an extreme dark
energy with their music. And their penises.

Ultra 3 - (RSP Crew - Regent Square) - The first 2 Ultra's have
been eliminated, and have been replaced with version 3.0. Hopefully, this
robot won't commit any mass destruction.

You'll have to pay $5 to see Dylan. Do you think that you stingy fucks can
part with that? As always, free freedom fries and free hot wings are
contingent upon purchase of booze.

16oz Iron City Drafts =3D $2. You do the math.

Just like your mother, FUZZ! sucks every Wednesday evening at the
Bloomfield Bridge Tavern (4412 East Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh) from 10ish
in the p.m. until 2ish in the a.m.

You must be born on or before stardate 339456.05 to attend.

Subject: {pb-cle} Three new album reviews from yours truly

I was gonna watch a movie tonight (I still may), but there's just so much
music that just came out!

First up is probably the most surprising bit to come out recently:  Armand
Van Helden's "Nympho".  I seriously had NO idea what to expect from AVH,
as he tends to be very hit-or-miss.  Well, it seems that he's been paying
attention to what's been going on musically and released an entire cd of
dance rock!  This is what The Killers would sound like if they had a 909
instead of a live drummer.  It's downright AWESOME, and I generally HATE
any house music made after 1991.  This album would be what happened if you
got into Doc's De Lorean, went back to 1997, and gave Robbie Rivera a
bunch of 2004-2005 rock songs to sample instead of his backstock of Gloria
Gaynor records.  Almost every track on this album is solid, most of which
have a "featuring <i>some rock band you've never heard of</i>" in the song
title, with the two standout tracks being "Into Your Eyes" and "When The
Lights Go Down", the latter being NOT a Journey remix (sadly), but a
slammin guitar and vocal loop with a pounding beat and bassline.  Also of
note for the trainspotters is "Hot City Nites", which samples the drum
roll from The Dead Milkmen's "You'll Dance To Anything"!  Good stuff from
this former resident of Boston.

Next up is Billy Corgan's extremely mistitled "Future Embrace".  Listen
Billy.  That A11th "chord" you made like 6 albums of songs out of just
doesn't sound that cool anymore.  During the "Siva" and "I Am One" days,
you were rockin, but this new one is underproduced, slow as fuck, noisy,
and downright boring.  I've listened to it like 5 times now, and couldn't
name one song off of it!  Sing in a different key for once, dammit!  The
only good track on this 1990s rehashing is the only thing that sounds even
slightly fresh, a little number called "The CameraEye".  It doesn't make
the album good or anything, but just check out this tune, and imagine the
rest of the album being just like it, but bad.

Finally, we have "Make Believe" by Weezer.  Very cool.  Who knew Weezer
was actually a GOOD BAND?  This album is actually somewhat <i>diverse</i>,
which isn't what I'd expect from Weezer, who I saw in 1996, and while they
were entertaining, they were definitely a one-trick-pony.  Not so here.
Sure, their signature droning, semi-whining, sarcastic vibe is aplenty,
but there is other stuff too.  "My Best Friend" is a White Stripes/Franz
Ferdinand-style rocker, while "This Is Such A Pity" is straight out of a
John Hughes movie, and "Beverly Hills" is nothing short of a full on rock
anthem.  Solid release from these guys; downright fun stuff.

for liking fresh music you seem awfully concerned with artists who
have been around for 11 years at the least and more like 15 years
in general. if i wanted to hear fresh music, i wouldnt be
listening to any of those guys.

Actually, I was thinking that if he were really paying attention to =
"what is going on musically" he would have known that AVH has been on =
that tired ass sound for 3 years now.

Can anyone say DOR or you all too young to remember that?

  for liking fresh music you seem awfully concerned with artists who

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Three new album reviews from yours truly

I've been under the impression he's been doing a lot of production on 
those top 40 remix CD's that xmix puts out, but I could be wrong. The 
guy seems to have his hand in a lot "mainstream" things at least. I 
dunno, I live under a rock with a bunch of schranz records these days.

I still pop in FBS vs. AVH at brixton academy when I need a big beat 
fix. Shh. Don't tell.

Subject: {pb-cle} Another sound check

Since Nick S did that sound test a couple weeks ago, thought I would  
do one, this time it's ripping vinyl to the computer.  Here are the  
the samples:

192kbps MP3 (about 2mb each):
http://www.vrillusions.com/xtrnl/pb-cle/1.mp3
http://www.vrillusions.com/xtrnl/pb-cle/2.mp3
http://www.vrillusions.com/xtrnl/pb-cle/3.mp3

If you really want to get the full WAV format (about 10mb each):
http://www.vrillusions.com/xtrnl/pb-cle/1wav
http://www.vrillusions.com/xtrnl/pb-cle/2wav
http://www.vrillusions.com/xtrnl/pb-cle/3wav

It's the first minute of Chris Liberator - Sky (Techno).  May not be  
the best sample, but figured it has a loud bassline and a high hat  
playing throughout it.  I cleaned the vinyl and stylus before doing  
this.  Still didn't do the 'archival' method of putting distilled  
water in front of the needle to help keep the needle cool, but I'll  
do that for when I do transfer them.  May be interesting to do a  
difference before and after doing that, too, but that's for later.

All recordings were done on a Mac PowerBook G4.  One of the  
recordings is from the mixer going into the line in of the laptop and  
recorded with audacity.  The other two are recorded using the griffin  
iMic, which is a USB device that has an audio input and output (idea  
is to do the audio processing outside the computer where there's not  
a lot of electrical noise).  Both are using Griffin's Finyl Vinyl  
which is a mac only app made that allows you to record straight from  
the turntable without the need of a mixer.  So one of them is from  
the turntable straight into the iMic and then Finyl Vinyl does the  
RIAA curve and amplifies it.  I then did a normal recording by going  
through the mixer and going into the iMic.  So in short, here are  
your three options:

1 - turntable to mixer to laptop
2 - turntable to mixer to iMic to laptop
3 - turntable to iMic to laptop

In theory going from turntable to iMic to laptop should yield the  
best results.  Won't say which one I liked better yet, though.  Person 
(s) who get the most right get absolutely nothing except being a 1337  
audiophile or something.

here's the way I see it...if everyone came out it would be a heck of a party. : )
so..come out! (Sorry if this was sent to the list already, don't know if Jamie did it or not yet)

TechMix @ Abbasso
TechMix 

Jamie Tyler (Plate Tectonics) 
Damon Havill (Plate Tectonics) 
 
 In the words of Jamie..."Techno Bitches!" 
 
For this month's installment of Techmix Damon and Jamie have decided to play an extended tag set that should range everywhere from minimal blips and clicks to some nice dirty nasty acid-infused techno by the end of the night. So, If you're in the mood for something a little more dirty than normal (but strangely drama-free ), stop by. we won't dissapoint. 
10 pm - 2:30 am (roughly) 
No Cover. 
Abbasso 
1222 Prospect (Enter on the Bolivar side by Gray's Armory) 
216.566.7278 

As a side note to this Jamie has pointed out that Abbasso's management has recently shifted and those that are in charge of day-to-day operations now have a renewed commitment to see electronic music once again flourish in the cave and a desire to work with the EDM community in Cleveland to see that happen. We're really looking forward to seeing what can be done with the place  
 
 
Upcoming TechMix nights at Abbasso: 
July 16: Andy James 
August 20th: T3

(check the site for mixes if you want a preview)


I'm an official card carrying member of the I HATE WINTER club.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Another sound check

And for those curious about looking at the waveforms:

http://www.vrillusions.com/xtrnl/pb-cle/123waveforms.png

from top to bottom it's 1, 2, and 3.  Yeah, I don't know why 3's  
waveform is reversed, still sounds fine, though.  that section is  
from about 27 seconds into the sample where a, umm, new sound comes in.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Another sound check

normalisation at best is marginal...at worst it just bumps up the noise
floor.

if u are gonna normalise...for the love of god, do it with waves L3...not
sonic foundry/sony normalise

but really the best bet is to just record at unity so you dont have to
normalise.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

DEEP PROGRESSIVE TECHNOLOGY

Amidst the thousands of artists and producers that work in the EDM 
industry today, Curtis and Leaha are of the few who strive to create 
truly original musical compositions. The live Progressive Breakbeat duo 
has been shredding the airwaves, dance floors, and club scene with their 
exceptional productions and intense performances. Their impeccable 
fusion of harmonious melodies and earth shaking beats creates a unique 
style and sound that cannot be matched.

Burufunk is best known for their chart topping remixes which include: BT 
"Somnambulist" (Nettwerk), Deepsky "Talk like a Stranger" (Yoshi Toshi), 
and Wrecked Angle "Back to Babylon" (Electrofly) which had remained in 
the Balance Record Pool top 20 for more than ten weeks. They were also 
recognized as one of the winners in the BPM Magazine Remix Contest for 
their rendition of BT's "The Great Escape". Their most recent remix 
collaboration had them working with BT to create: BT vs The Doors "Break 
on Through (To the Other Side)..

Their signature tracks have been heavily supported by the likes of Paul 
Oakenfold, BT, Deepsky, Hybrid and DJ Icey to name a few. Likewise, 
their first release together "Outsider" was featured on Global 
Underground 024 'Reykjavik' mixed by Nick Warren. Look to Godsend Music 
for more Burufunk material launching this summer as well as an upcoming 
album in the works.

So much can be said about these visionaries... but their music is 
something words cannot express.

Sun Jun 19                         JOHN B                        Pittsburgh

Focused Motives

Prana Gallery
2010 Smallman st
Pittsburgh, PA 15222

Another rocking night brought to you by Focused Motives

John B . If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical 
guises over the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at 
a young age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the 
most eclectic and unique individuals working within electronic music 
today. Consistently escaping categorization, John s genre-defying 
catalogue spans the worlds of Electro, tr**ce and Drum & Bass, and a few 
other spaces across the bpm spectrum.
John.s career began in illustrious style as the one and only Goldie 
picked up on this mild-mannered, blonde-locked science graduate and his 
distinctive drum and bass beat constructions, and he was signed to the 
legendary Metalheadz label. Tracks such as the euphoric Up All Night 
have become instant classics in the canon of drum and bass, and 
repeatedly smashed dancefloors worldwide. John B quickly became a 
headlining name on flyers across the globe, and his touring schedule has 
been non-stop ever since. Establishing his own stable of labels (Beta 
Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse 
tastes from liquid funk to Latin, provided the perfect platform for John 
s groundbreaking sonic experimentation to develop.
>From his studio and label HQ in Maidenhead, UK, John has since made 
major waves within the wider world of dance music. Having picked up on 
John s early forays into trance production, Perfecto label boss and DJ 
superstar Paul Oakenfold commissioned tracks which ended up alongside 
the likes of Madonna and Justin Timberlake on the epic Great Wall 
compilation. John has also long worn his love of 80s electronica on his 
sleeve, way before the fashionistas jumped on the bandwagon, and he has 
been busy signing hot new electro-influenced tracks for his most recent 
label venture, Nu Electro. There is also rumoured to be a John B 
reworking of Toni Basil.s classic Hey Mickey in the pipeline.
Still just the tender age of 26, is there is much more to come from Mr 
B. Next up, godfather of soul James Brown.s new tracks are due for the 
John B remix treatment, a real surprise for even this musical chameleon. 
He s also been busy Remixing Howard Jones, Heaven 17, Digital Nation, 
Robbie Craig and S.Express. True to form, it doesn.t seem as if things 
will be becoming predictable any time soon.

DJ Tanner - Dj Tanner is no stranger to the Pittsburgh electronic music 
scene. Shortly after making his mark at Trainwreck Tuesday.s , DJ Tanner 
went on to co-found Full House Productions, throwing some of the most 
banging EDM nights in Pittsburgh.
With early trance and house influences there is no question why his 
genre of choice is progressive. Armed with his melodic mixing and unique 
programming, Tanner touches a vast variety of genres ranging from 
progressive house, breaks, techno and tech-house. His goal. crowd 
response. Rest ashore, Tanner will flex his muscle and show Pittsburgh 
an impressive display of his eclectic taste in music.

DJ NatasK . Born Joseph Kodba, Graduate of Mercyhurst College with a 
degree in Electronic Communications. DJ NatasK started throwing parties 
with his partner Anthony Lang, as Mynespent Productions. After much 
success and his strong faction of supporters the collaboration threw 
Genesis, their first large scale party featuring some of Pittsburgh.s 
hottest dj.s. This truly was a Genesis, starting his adventure of DJing 
and promoting! After graduation, NatasK moved to Pittsburgh, pursuing a 
career as a photojournalist for KDKA TV. Soon there after 
SubsurfaceTribe was created and over the first year in Pittsburgh, 
traveled back to native Erie PA to run Generator with his partner DJ 
Nature and long time friend Iggy. Generator showcased talent from the 
entire tri-state region. During which he kept a monthly schedule of 
bookings from Ohio to upstate New York. Currently the Subsurfacetribe 
hosts Smooth Grooves, a Wednesday night weekly at the Z-Lounge on east 
Carson Street.

JAIA (Digital Structures . France) LIVE!
The act JAIA is the project of  the French producer Yannis Kamarinos, 
formed in 1995 with Jean-Michel Blanchet and first oriented  Psy-Trance 
and Downtempo.  Since 2000 Yannis is working alone under JAIA name,  and 
today JAIA.s music is more orientated to Progressive House and 
Progressive Trance (and still Downtempo too).  JAIA has already released 
an album .Blue Energy. in 1998 (Cross/EastWest/Nova Tekk), which has 
been re-released in 2000 on the Japanese label Dakini.  JAIA released 
several 12" singles too, as well as numerous tracks on various label 
compilations, such as  Island, Iboga, Wagram, Milan, Flying Rhino, 
T.I.P. World, and many others.  The new album "Fiction" will be released 
in May 2005 on Digital Structures.  Yannis has collaborated with other 
producers-DJ.s such as DADO, WIZY NOISE, and SILICON SOUND.  He has 
remixed famous artists like the French singer MYLENE FARMER . including 
her last two singles "C.est Une Belle Journée" and "Pardonne-Moi"

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

featuring hundreds of performers from around the world. Continuing the 
tradition that began at the very start of the electronic music scene, 
Destiny returns with its boldest production to date and very special

graced the stages of WEMF. In total, over 200 artists are booked for 
2005. Two main stages cater to Trance, House, Techno, Breaks, DnB & 
Jungle with smaller sub stages providing hardcore, psychedelic and 
ambient beats to complete the full spectrum of electronic dance sounds.

Traveling to WEMF each year has become the thing to do for those who 
want an experience of a lifetime. In the past decade, well over 100,000 
people have experienced the WEMF phenomenon. License plates from 20 
states and 5 provinces were observed last year and busses were chartered

[whaaaa? a pgh party?]

P.U.M.P. (Pittsburgh Underground Music Production) is Pittsburgh's first
annual underground music celebration on 07.16.05. Department of Energy,
Nightbreed Productions, Koala-tea, Nightvision, Full House, Electrasoul,
and Death x Stereo are just some of the crews working to make this event
one to remember.

First, Nightbreed Productions and Department of NRG bring their
specialty to the table and made it possible for this event to be held in
a virgin venue.  This multi room WAREHOUSE with over 15,000 square feet
will provide you with adequate dancing space, multi room environments,
and most of all provide that underground feeling associated with
underground music.

Second, Koala-tea brings on their skills and makes it possible for some
of our big bookings for this show. Plus, Koala-tea is bringing out some
of their drum n bass talent, along with Pittsburgh's own Death x Stereo
crew, the drum n bass for this event will be off the hook.

Third, Electrasoul along with Electralight will be providing sound and
lighting for this event. With FOUR stages already confirmed and state of
the art lighting and visuals, this event holds lots of suprises for
everyone.

Last, local crews such as Nightvision and Full House represent most of
our local lineup for this event. Progressive House, break beats, techno,
all over the place, these crews will be sure to keep the crowd
movin...all night long.

Event runs from 9pm till 6am. Admission will be $20 all night plus on 
site, secure parking available. Vendors please contact Department of 
Energy at 412-708-0473 before May 31st. Any further questions please

Sat Jul 23                   LAWNCHAIR GENERALS                   Cleveland

Coming to Wish Saturday July 23rd

LawnChair Generals (Viva, Westbound, Lowdown)

Seattle transplants Peter Christianson and Carlos Mendoza, better known 
as the Lawnchair Generals, have been generating beats out of their 
self-made studio for the past two years. Based on the brief amount of 
time the duo has spent manning the controls, the success they have 
attained is staggering. As goes the old adage, it is quality, not 
quantity that breeds such success; along with their blinding talent, 
both behind the decks and in the studio, and a little luck thrown in for 
good measure, the Generals have blazed their way into the record crates 
of the world's top DJs and onto internationally distributed mixes 
compiled by the industry's most prolific jocks. "The egalitarian nature 
of this industry is what allows us to completely transcend the fact that 
we're from a town that has been mostly rock oriented," says Carlos. "It 
allows us to be on equal footing with people who have been making great 
house music for a long time."

Lawn Chair Generals likely represent the next creative event in 
underground house music, a sound carefully crafted unlike much of the 
slapped together economy of the dance music prevelant to date. Carlos 
Mendoza and Peter Christianson met in 2000 and almost immediatelly began 
experimenting with the possibilities of house music. Their very first 
experiment yielded their first release on Viva Recordings, "The Great 
Escape". The pair was pleasantly surprised when this release garnered 
the praise of national and worldwide heavyweights alike. Charted in 
publications by the likes of Mark Farina and Colin Dale of the BBC, and 
broken out on dance floors by Johnny Fiasco, DJ Heather, Doc Martin, Rob 
Mello and more all over the world, their "West Coast meets Chicago" 
sound has garnered this pair more attention than they expected...Remixes 
for Viva, Deepfunk and Amenti extend this duo's sound to the works of 
other emerging underground talents such as Hanna, Rhythm Slaves and 
Alexander East.

Bailey
[[[Metalheadz, 1Xtra, Swerve, Intasound]]]
UK

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the 
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats 
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey.s South London 
stomping ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, 
DJing at house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the 
mellow hip hop of the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and 
harder; Acid House . the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the 
rave scene. It was on this acid house path, in around .91 that he found 
a turning for hardcore, inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of 
this road he entered the door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate 
station .Energy FM.. It was his ability on that very station that 
impressed Kemistry and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play 
at one of the first Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. 
Through moving on the circuit Bailey joined forces with other 
influential South London selectors and MC.s, forming the Inta Natty crew 
which consisted of himself, Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known 
for managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin. Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm 
and Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by 
playing in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, 
Canada, America and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has 
been all over the mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some 
of which include: One Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric 
Live, The End, Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldie.s club 
Metalheadz and Fabio.s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people 
want has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting 
line up, every Sunday night (11pm . 1am) and in 2003 he won the award 
for .Best Radio Show. at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for 
many projects including mixed CD.s for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of 
Sound, France.s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass 
record store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size 
& A Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja 
and in 2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing 
tracks from cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he 
has the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an 
impression and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ.s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to . 
recognition and respect.

I don't believe that "unity" applies to digital audio.  For example, 
"unity" would be where the reference mark of zero (as painted on the 
mixer channel) is equal to a reading of zero (as painted on the vu 
meters) on an analog tape deck.  The "zero" in the analogue world is 
a reference, but the "zero" in the digital world is a maximum - and 
the zeros are not the same 0db vs 0dbv (?)

Digitally recording as close to zero as possible without clipping 
means the convertor will use as many of the 16/24 bits as possible.

Sort of like in the digital photography world.  Can't go from low-res 
to hi-res just by changing the dpi..But one can always go fro hi-res 
to low-res.

yeah, I was going to normalize it, but didn't want to do any sort of  
post editing at all.  I have this mini compressor, forget who it's  
made by, something with an A.  But was going to have it go through  
that, plus in finyl vinyl I think at -6 it starts to show red bars.

When I finally do decide which way i like better, I'll probably just  
always keep the levels at the right level according to the program so  
I don't have to bother with getting more cables to hook up the  
compressor.

There was a white label remix of a dancehall tune called "Badman" that

song is.

Mainly just for archiving and listening and stuff.  Maybe FS or use  
on cd's for backup or something, but not the main reason.  Main  
reason is I want to listen to them to at work so I get a better feel  
for what I have.  Been practicing a few times and being surprised at  
some track I have because I usually play the other side.  I already  
have about half of my records in a db, and I'll link the mp3s to that  
too (yes, most of this is because I'm bored and don't want to do more  
important stuff like cleaning my room)

Heh.  I've been debating attempting to archive all my vinyl, but I think  
it would take WAYYY too long.  I have like 3500 records.

bought some since then.

touring all over hell and back the past year.

The track was released on Jungle Expiditions records (#001) out of Canada.
Here is a pic of the label.

Fuck.. I didn't even realize this. I should have put two and two together.  
Damn..  I havent seen those guys in a really long time. Thanks for the  
heads up btw. One of those guys used to grab my ass all the time at  
parties, and would never introduce himself. Altho, I wouldnt either.. Just  
thought it was hilarious..

Thats really funny...  Im kinda shocked.

Actually you're wrong.  That's a DIFFERENT Buccaneer remix.  That's the  
Star Wars riddim remix.
http://media.ragga-jungle.com/play.php?file=Dubs/Mad+Dem+Sound/Twinhooker_-_Any_Bwoy_Dis.mp3



The song I posted is a "Badman Sonata" remix.


Similiar, but different tunes.


After a day of researching and help, I know!  And knowing is half the  
battle!


Actually, you're probably right, but he has the wrong link up for Badman  
Time.  He has the Star Wars thing up there instead.

Now that I think of it, that is his name. I always had to ask someone  
else..
He would always wear something that covered his identity too. Like a hat  
pulled over his face or something.
I always thought those guys were awesome, and crazy. I never took the time  
out to actually meet them and get silly as well. Good to hear theyre doing  
things.. even though Keiths married now. Tell his ass to get up all  
ready.. Im sure it would be hot if he did.

Are they living around here anymore?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Another sound check

what i meant was record with the output turned up to the mixer as far as it
can go before clipping...that way you dont have to normalise...i guess im
kinda spoiled atm....but most ppl tend to record their dj sets either way to
loud or way to quiet figuring normalisation will fix it...but it wont...if u
start with a clipped signal...you'll end with one...and if u start with a
signal close to the noisefloor...normalisation is only going to raise the
noisefloor up.

best bet for dj's is to record with the master at about between 12 and
3oclock...the channel gains around 9-12....and the eq flat....its better to
cut the eq's then to boost them for digital recording....when you play live
its a different story....but even then you should probably cut eqs instead
of boosting(i have a bad habit of boosting eq's live myself)

true that...only the really big boxes(like sherry's pink box) come close to
holding 100...most record boxes hold like 60....you'd be lucky to stuff 50

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Another sound check

Very good advice. Counting on any one particular filter or effect (ie 
normalize) to "fix" a mix means your already aiming low before you ever 
got started ;)
I also completely agree about removing eq vs boosting it, I call it 
reductionism (anybody know a dictionary of mixing terms?) pull away from 
what is to be accentuated instead of pushing it (and probably your 
levels) past where they should be. Also if you push your eq's your 
almost sure to just keep getting louder and louder until you start 
mashing your sound. Also I use master @ 8/10 on mixers with sliders.

Go to the Dubplates section....year 2003. The badman time link on that page=

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Another sound check

the technical term for cutting eq's instead of boosting is "subtractive
eqing"...admittedly its a technique that works best on a 4band dual swept
mid eq(the "british" eq)...but even on a 2 or 3 band dj mixer...its
definately a good idea to never boost any of the bands while you are
recording digitally..if u are recording to tape...i dont think it really
matters...cuz tape can handle the saturation pretty well....well vcr's and
reel decks anyways, most cassette decks have a limiter built into
them...which just squashes sounds that are overly saturated.


"cuz knowing is half the battle"

I just go by the 0db mark on the mixer.  I'll adjust the gain so the  
track is peaking at 0 and then adjust the master so it's at 0 (which  
is between 12 o clock and 3 o clock).  The input on the computer was  
set to 50%  Probably should have adjusted that using audacity which  
shows the levels better than finyl vinyl.  Although I had problems  
getting the iMic to be recognized in it (I guess it's a known bug)  
any other free soundforge-like apps for the mac?

BLeh, I gave up on my mac for that reason. The big sound editor is 
Quattro, free is Audacity. There used to be a free version of spark, but 
it crashed like me after work.

I was hammered then, I'm hammered now. Forgive that minor part where the

Should be partying it up in vegas in a few weeks doing this sort of 
thing @ DEFCON. Well, minus the liquor... before hand.

my mix i just posted is pretty darn loud and clear. i set the
mixer to a little over 0 and had the audio peaking at -.1 db in

Yeah, I don't really have a choice at the moment.  My linux server's  
motherboard stopped working.  And until I can get a new one (the ones  
I got off ebay don't work, working with the guy now) my desktop pc is  
being used for the server (just hooked the server's hard drives into  
it).  So I've been using my work mac laptop in the meantime till I  
get the ocmputer thing all straightened out.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ARTHUR BAKER, DOC MARTIN, TOMMIE SUNSHINE, PRINCESS SUPERSTAR: THIS SUNDAY!

i heard arthur baker's recent shit. how can someone so great fall
off so hard? the shit was like some wack breaks/breakbeat garage
type nonsense. i mean honestly, in the early 80s the guy was damn
near untouchable. he did so much great shit i could play hours of
just his music. 

"confusion" by new order came out on his label Streetwise, as did
many many many other classic dance jams. its one of my favorite
labels of all time. 

the rest of those people on the lineup dont deserve to hold his
cock while he plays, regardless of how wack his new shit is.

Court: mushrooms not banned by drug law=20
 =09=09=09=09=09=09=09Source: AP
 =09=09=09=09=09=09=09 =09=09=09=09=09=09=09 =09=09=09SANTA FE -- The state=
 Court of Appeals says
growing hallucinogenic mushrooms is not banned under New Mexico's law
against manufacturing an illegal drug.

The appellate judges overturned the felony drug trafficking conviction
of an Alamogordo man for growing psilocybin mushrooms in his home.

Under state law, drug trafficking includes the manufacturing of illegal dru=
gs.

But the court says growing mushrooms was not covered by the drug
trafficking law's definition of "manufacture."

The hallucinogenic substance in the mushrooms -- psilocybin  -- is an
illegal controlled substance under state and federal law.

i heard arthur baker's recent shit. how can someone so great fall
off so hard? the shit was like some wack breaks/breakbeat garage
type nonsense. i mean honestly, in the early 80s the guy was damn
near untouchable. he did so much great shit i could play hours of
just his music.

"confusion" by new order came out on his label Streetwise, as did
many many many other classic dance jams. its one of my favorite
labels of all time.

the rest of those people on the lineup dont deserve to hold his
cock while he plays, regardless of how wack his new shit is.

Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher // metalheadz, swerve, intasound


Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
?Energy FM?. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MC?s, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin? Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldie?s club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CD?s for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to ?
recognition and respect.

// philly M.o.C. // illyemcee.com, substitution



Destroying trends, smashing through adversaries, and perfecting the art of
being; Illy emcee's album "Living in the Moment" is here to forge ahead, and
rearrange the current sound of hip-hop. Geared towards the educated
consumer, this album is laced with engaging lyrical content and rock solid
production. Working with German based hip-hop phenom, Minnox, as well as
Philly based artists, Dstar, J Smooth, and Ducketts; Illy focuses on
bringing back quality and creativity to music.

Moving from Baltimore, to Philadelphia proved a prosperous relocation.
Linking up with the likes of Armmani, Sharpness, and Messinain, he could be
heard at Diesel Boy?s infamous club night, Platinum. Illy also sets it off
the second friday of every month, with Mental Sharp at "the free hip hop
party".

On the production side, Illy forms the "Brigade" with Noisemachine and
Tension. They aim to please with quality tracks ranging from catchy dance
floor killers, to melodic, vibing jams. Illy's work can be heard on Phylum
recordings and the knowledge mix cd (may 2005 mixed by silver), as well as
and collabortations with the likes of SS, Skibadee, MC Trip, Killa Kella,
Spor and the Black Sun Empire.

Yeah Bailey said he's hyped about coming back here..

btw nick.. he said he almost forgot about the anaconda incident, but has a  
new thing we should watch out for..  something about trying to sell his  
black cock on the streets when he's drunk. i thought that was the most  
hilarious shit i heard all day.

this should be super fun...

Subject: {pb-cle} Feelgood 6/24 in clev? can anyone confirm

on Feelgood's website it says he will be at Cloud 9 in Clev. on 6/24... but 
on Cloud 9's website there is no mention of him.
Can anyone confirm or deny that Feelgood will be in clev. friday 6/24? If he 
is i may just have to come out of my shell.
Thanks
Becca

I'm almost positive this is at Tramp/Funky Budha...just down the street. I

I feel like an ass asking this, but does Tall Paul still Dj at all?.. Ive  
got a really old mix from him that's super good, but I never really hear  
anything bout him.

I could honestly ask this same question about alot of missing Djs.  
Carlito, Invaderz.. :(

BTW.. I asked about Dj 3D to someone the other day, forgot who it was. Its  
ironic I saw his name on a flyer recently in Chicago.

Just rambling.

Yeah I was there for that. I also remember him last at Bass Invaderz @ The  
Players Club with Max (Mc Duh which is coming out for Mathematics).

Ive always loved that dude man..

I was told a long time ago that he got arrested from child porn or  
something like that, and I hadnt heard about him since, until the other  
night when I saw him on a flyer.

Nah.. I can find the flyer Nicks talking about. I forget what the name of  
the party was, but it was in 1999 if Im not mistaken.

I also remember not alot people were there, but he did smash down a nice  
set.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Final Scratch Vs Serato

A buddy of mine picked up final scratch for the exact same reason and
he's trying to sell his.  He said it would work fine and then it would
glitch on him.  Like the pitch control would suddenly go off while he
was mixing and weird noises amongst other things.
And I saw richie play in louisville last july and a few of his mixes
he had to bail out on because the program would change pitch on him as
well.  I haven't heard of Serato before.  But apparently there's a lot
of problems to be had with final scratch.

Serato, hands down.  I've known a few people who had Final Scratch and
sold it for Serato Scratch.  I've used Serato, never had any problems
with the PC software, only had a problem once with the OS/X version.=20
Turned out it was the MP3, which also wouldn't play in Winamp.

Dont get either. Get Ms. Pinky. The best digital vinyl setup there is. Dont=
=20
make the mistake of getting either of those. Research at the links below an=
d=20
read the few reasons why Ms. Pinky would be the best choice.

http://www.mspinky.com/
http://www.dacs-audio.com/Distribution/MsPinky/MsPinky_main.htm
http://www.cycling74.com/products/mspinky.html

Why you ask?
You can scratch any audio and/or video files at the same time.


But most importantly..... Physical Location Stamps!!!!

Unlike other systems which employ "timecode" on vinyl, MsPinky's vinyl=20
records (available in black or pink) contain specially modulated *physical=
=20
location stamps*. As the needle traces the groove, MsPinky's software=20
listens to the sound coming from the record player and is able to tell=20
instantly the* *physical position of the needle on the surface of the=20
record. There are approximately 155 totally unique physical position stamps=
=20
per rotation of the record, and the duration of record playback at 33-1/3=
=20
rpm is 18.5 minutes. To give you an idea of the latency, this means that=20
MsPinky's software reads a new physical position stamp every 12 millisecond=
s=20
when the record is played at 33-1/3 rpm. Velocity and direction information=
=20
is updated every *1.5 milliseconds*.

One clear advantage of using *physical location stamps* as opposed to the=
=20
"timecode" used by other systems is that the absolute position information=
=20
can be decoded whether the record is spinning forwards, or in reverse. With=
=20
other commercially available "timecode"-on-vinyl systems, if you take up th=
e=20
needle while the record is spinning forwards... then begin to spin the=20
record backwards.. and then place the needle down on the surface of the=20
record in a new location while the turntable still spins in reverse-- the=
=20
"timecode"-based system will not accurately track to the new position! This=
=20
is because "timecode" cannot be demodulated in reverse. *Physical location=
=20
stamps*, however,* *can be decoded accurately and reliably regardless of=20
whether the turntable is spinning forwards or in reverse.

Position stamps can be used in many different ways besides just calculating=
=20
a time clocking signal. They can be translated into time values for cueing=
=20
up a sound file, but they can also be used to change color or texture=20
mappings in a 3-D animation inside Max/MSP/Jitter<http://www.cycling74.com/=

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Final Scratch Vs Serato

If you want to scratch audio and video, Serato wouldn't be in that category=
.

However, I'm certain that Serato knows where on the record the needle
currently is.  And yes, it will play backwards.  I'm not sure if you
take the needle up, then spin the record in reverse, then put it back
down, but I can check this weekend.

I second that emotion. Ms. Pinky is super. With the others you're paying 
for an overpriced one trick pony sound interface also. The only thing 
FS2 has going for it is Traktor integration, which is a bonus in my 
book. I love "the stripe" and some of the other features of Traktor 2.6.

If you already have an ASIO compliant sound interface with enough ins 
and outs, you might give DJdecks a try on the cheap and see if it works 
for you. It works with a few of the different timecoded vinyl formats 
(including Ms. Pinky) and your existing sound interface. It's $30 to 
buy, then the cash for the FS or Ms. Pinky records and you're set. Info 
@ http://www.djdecks.be. Cool little demo video if you hunt around. If 
it works for you great. No need to blow $$$ on the others, unless you're 
lacking ASIO.

the unreleased stuff I get because it isn't as good as the vinyl I
buy.  I have finally made a few I would consider playing and I think
it is well worth the 50 bux to get it pressed even if it is just so I
can have it on vinyl.  I wouldn't get acetate though, they got that
new shit now that lasts just as long as regular vinyl.

Besides I am way to lazy to set up one of those systems and the last
thing I want to do when I am djing is stare at a computer screen.

Or just fucking learn how to spin on cd players and quit pretending
that your mp3's are vinyl.

Possibly as importantly, Ms. Pinky looks like it's $100, instead of
several hundred.

Anyone ever have some hands-on time with the software?

on note @ Detroit Richie seemed to be having those same problems (listen 
to the first 20 min of the set, random backspins) untill somebody 
switched some cable for him.
As for just pressing tracks most producers test play their tracks 
digitally for crowd reaction before sending them off to press, not to 
metion some tracks have a time and place and arn't really meant for 
release (sans richie, beyer, corola on and on.....). maybe I should just 
go digital decks and screw all this marketing mumbo jumbo ;)

  Dont get either.  Get Ms. Pinky.  The best digital vinyl setup there =
is.  Dont make the mistake of getting either of those.  Research at the =
links below and read the few reasons why Ms. Pinky would be the best =
choice.

  http://www.mspinky.com/
  http://www.dacs-audio.com/Distribution/MsPinky/MsPinky_main.htm
  http://www.cycling74.com/products/mspinky.html

  Why you ask?
  You can scratch any audio and/or video files at the same time.


  But most importantly..... Physical Location Stamps!!!!


  Unlike other systems which employ "timecode" on vinyl, MsPinky's vinyl =
records (available in black or pink) contain specially modulated =
physical location stamps. As the needle traces the groove, MsPinky's =
software listens to the sound coming from the record player and is able =
to tell instantly the physical position of the needle on the surface of =
the record. There are approximately 155 totally unique physical position =
stamps per rotation of the record, and the duration of record playback =
at 33-1/3 rpm is 18.5 minutes. To give you an idea of the latency, this =
means that MsPinky's software reads a new physical position stamp every =
12 milliseconds when the record is played at 33-1/3 rpm. Velocity and =
direction information is updated every 1.5 milliseconds.

  One clear advantage of using physical location stamps as opposed to =
the "timecode" used by other systems is that the absolute position =
information can be decoded whether the record is spinning forwards, or =
in reverse. With other commercially available "timecode"-on-vinyl =
systems, if you take up the needle while the record is spinning =
forwards... then begin to spin the record backwards.. and then place the =
needle down on the surface of the record in a new location while the =
turntable still spins in reverse-- the "timecode"-based system will not =
accurately track to the new position! This is because "timecode" cannot =
be demodulated in reverse. Physical location stamps, however, can be =
decoded accurately and reliably regardless of whether the turntable is =
spinning forwards or in reverse.

  Position stamps can be used in many different ways besides just =
calculating a time clocking signal. They can be translated into time =
values for cueing up a sound file, but they can also be used to change =
color or texture mappings in a 3-D animation inside Max/MSP/Jitter!=20

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Final Scratch Vs Serato

See I am starting to think this "testing it on a crowd" thing is
bullshit.  If you are a good dj, you already know what people are
going to dance to.  You don't test the vinyl you buy do you?  Of
course not because you wouldnt have bought it if you didn't think it
was good, same deal.  I know most of the tunes that I have written in
the past are filler tunes because of my expirience as a dj, thats why
I don't bother testing them or sending them out to lables.  Basically
if you don't know, then let me save you the trouble, your tune sucks.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Final Scratch Vs Serato

why spend all that money to press one record?

thats assinine tom, and you know it.

besides you cant press 1 record...i think the minium is like 300(there maybe
one place out west that will do 10 record test runs, but its still like
300bux or so)...and these days its around 1500bux for a 300 record run...for
1500 bux you could buy a dedicated lappy, serrato, and it'll pay for its
self if u make more than 1 track you ever wanna play out.

and dont give me no jibba jabba about dubplates...at 40bux a plate..its even
dumber...cuz they dont last but 50 plays(if your lucky)

Here's the question though. Would you pay for it if you were a wealthy  
producer?..

Well thats a stupid question.  You don't get wealthy from producing dance m=
usic.

There is new technology with dubplates, they can cut straight to vinyl
now instead of acetate, so the record should last you the rest of your
life if you take care of it.  Thats what I was thinking about doing
but I just saw that they are asking 60 pounds for the service, ouch!=20
Change of plans, get a label or distributer to back you or stfu!=20
heheh.

The producers don't usually pay out pocket unless they are just starting
out.  It used to be the record label, but now it's not even them, it's the
distributor paying for the pressing (which is destined to implode anytime
soon)


It's all really stupid.  It's not the 40s.  But even beyond that, vinyl
essentially killed the electronic music scene.  Why?  Because in order for
anyone to even break even while pressing vinyl, the tune has to be
something that people besides the producer would play (and buy), and
therefore all tunes pressed must adhere to some formula, hence making
electronic music the formulaic crap it is.


Surely, Tom, in your moonbat communist anti-capitalist anti-american
bubble, can understand this.

I'm sure SOME still do, but generally nowadays it's the distro paying.

Its not stupid honestly. You dont think Fresh, or Dbridge, or any of those  
guys arent (lets put it this way) "comfortable" where they stand at the  
moment?... Im sure theyre pumping out tunes on a regular, but theyre  
feeling a bitter better than where most of you stand with your tunes alone  
right now. (And Im not saying that in a bad way either.)

We've all ready had this discusion a while back if I recall.. To bad they  
arent archived.

Agreed, but I'd hazard a guess they are making most of their money from  
DJing out, not from record sales.


And I'm sure Fresh, since you used him as an example, is making quite a  
pretty penny from advertising on DOA.

I'm sure some of them are doing pretty well but not wealthy.  I doubt
djing is going to give them much of a pension.

Get a nice cd player. Its much easier to set up at a live show, plus it 
doesn't crash, ever.
I suggest the technics, its pretty solid, lots of features.
But if you just wanna play your tracks, then i recommed the numark axis 
8, its cheap.

The distributers are everything now, at least in dnb.  I would say at
the moment it would be beter to send demos to the distros than the
labels because the distros have to ok the tunes for the small and
medium labels.  That is or will be a problem, I agree.

I've made it a point to not support anyone who has booked him (or anyone

Subject: {pb-cle} pressing vinyl is retarded

Point is well made but probably goes one step to far. While in the 
growth of a trend the original format ultimitly becomes a hinderance to 
the growth of the trend their always comes a cultural or marketing 
impass upon which after formats change and things cycle again. As for 
distros paying for the press it gets kinda scary there (wallmart 
anyone). On the same token I know with most techno (not electornic) and 
various other 'camps" much attention and intent is put into every 
release, catch adam beyer 4 times in a month and you can see the 
progression of his ideas catching a common rythm getting matched with 
various atmospheres untill finally he'll release the cumulation of this 
test and play style onto the market under whichever of his labels fits 
the feeling of the music. however it's obvious the marketing and distro 
system of electronic has had enourmous impact on the quality of material 
esspecially in the more commonly accepted genres in america.


entropy:
The producers don't usually pay out pocket unless they are just starting
out.  It used to be the record label, but now it's not even them, it's the
distributor paying for the pressing (which is destined to implode anytime
soon)


It's all really stupid.  It's not the 40s.  But even beyond that, vinyl
essentially killed the electronic music scene.  Why?  Because in order for
anyone to even break even while pressing vinyl, the tune has to be
something that people besides the producer would play (and buy), and
therefore all tunes pressed must adhere to some formula, hence making
electronic music the formulaic crap it is.


Surely, Tom, in your moonbat communist anti-capitalist anti-american
bubble, can understand this.

1500 bux will get you like 700 records + 100 test presses and that 
includes mastering and stampers and labels and jackets.  Dubplates are 
definitely what's up in terms of making you think twice about the 
quality of your tune (is it bomb enough to put your $ where your mouth 
is and cut it??)... And itd be nice to have 50 gigs to wear them out at 
right?

I used those guys for a run of 300 whites in 2001.  They had a deal then  
for 300 whites for 975.00.  With shipping (from CA) I think it was 1075.00  
total.

They have different deals now, but the vinyl was quality.

*shrug*

I think you mean 'dance music scene', not 'electronic music scene'.

Im sure... but what about letting others hear your snazz, by letting your  
friends play it?..

Honestly.. I do what Ive always done, and I probably wont spend time in  
buying anything other. Play it on cd. Until it gets a release or put on  
wax, then Ill just do what I do now.

Hell, the DANCE MUSIC "scene" is doing just fine.  The Killers and the

If your goal is to get people to dance to it, it can't hurt.  They do
it for every last movie that's released, and it helps them tune
that...

You have a point, I guess I just can't be arsed to drop a half assed
tune that I wrote when I have so much good music in my crate.  There
are other ways to test your tunes... like mixing them in private and
then listen to the recording yourself.  Or ask the freinds that you
trust for an honest review (I know that can be hard to get)  Accually
what I have been doing lately is giving out all the tunes I am working
on to my freinds, I figure the ones that they spin are worth
developing further.

If you press quality music, it's not too hard to break even, even at 
small qtys, and you don't need a p+d deal either.  DIY is still very 
much well alive.  Anyone here can press a record tomorrow if you wanted 
to, after spending time saving up.

Digital is killing more than just vinyl, but the effects of that won't =
be seen for a long time yet.

I don't think digital is HELPING vinyl, but I don't think its going =
anywhere any time soon. =20

The last few weeks I have caught more and more wind of consumers (who =
don't know who i am and what i do) commenting on how djs who play cds =
are boring. Both in a local and national context.

people have over 20 years of deejays playing records on national
television to help brainwash them. theres just something not right
about it changing. and as "progressive" as people who play CDs or
other non vinyl think they are, the shit is still wack. and i
think most people are going to feel the same way. theres an
expectation that deejays are on another level of musical knowledge
and commitment from a normal everyday person. if youre playing
shit from the same format, it takes away part of that mystique.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Final Scratch Vs Serato

heres the thing about duplates..when u do a run of records you get some...to
make sure the final cut for the mother plate will be right...if u price a
run of records...it usually includes 3-10 dubs(depending on the order
size)5-25 test presses(again, the more records you are gonna run, the more
t.p.'s u get), then your main run of records...there is a bunch of copies to
reference around...this happens to make sure the final cut comes out
good..and i know u have alot of records that were poorly cut...i certainly
do...9 times out of 10 its a promo too...but this is the old model...not to
say its a bad model...but it keeps stuff outa peoples hands longer..im
starting to think the reason cybertron took so long to get out...is cuz
dillinja didnt like the way it was sounding on the club systems...so he kept
remixing and mastering it...til all the frequencies fit right and it sounded
good everywhere.

so anyways.... if u are a wealthy producer(actually label owner)....u ar
getting the dubs anyways if u are cutting wax...u cant spin all of them...so
u pass them around to your friends...who are also wealthy producers...mostly
anymore it seems the guys with plates are the bigger djs...the producers
usually use cds anymore...the best dj will use anything availible

bedtime for me

Well thats a stupid question.  You don't get wealthy from producing dance
music.

There is new technology with dubplates, they can cut straight to vinyl
now instead of acetate, so the record should last you the rest of your
life if you take care of it.  Thats what I was thinking about doing
but I just saw that they are asking 60 pounds for the service, ouch!
Change of plans, get a label or distributer to back you or stfu!
heheh.

in pittsburgh im pretty sure there's more right now than there
were 5 years ago. 2 dance shops closed down, one because the owner
moved away the other because the owner was a crackhead.

I had a very enlightening conversation this weekend with an old friend. 
I've never read Orwel's 1984 but my friend was saying something to the 
effect that "Progressive is one of the words that our government has

You didn't miss any point.  He's an anti-American radical who is worthy of  
jail time.

I really dont have a one sided stance on this whole topic. I appreciate all=
=20
mediums...analog and digital and the advantages, disadvantages, and=20
possibilities of both. But just from experience I thought I would throw out=
=20
some numbers.

Now to master, plate, and press 500 copies (+5 test pressings) of a 2 sided=
=20
12 inch record with greyscale labels, and plain white diecut sleeves it wil=
l=20
run you right around $1500 dollars. The average price you will get from a=
=20
distributor per record is $3 (if your lucky enough that they even want to=
=20
distrubute the record). So if you sell all 500 copies to distro for $3 that=
s=20
$1500, you break even. But chances are you arent going to sell all 500=20
copies. You will want to send/hand out some promo's to dj's, producers,=20
magazines, and friends. Now if you dont sell all of them to the distro and=
=20
sell some at your shows or through your website then you can make up a bit=

of that. But my point is...vinyl is really hard to make a buck on. Your=20
lucky if you make enough to press the next record. And what happens when yo=
u=20
get that distro check and your broke and your rent is due? There goes the=

next record.

Anyways...just wanted to throw some data out there.

im honestly wondering where you people who reference record

can get that done for about $1000 with 2 color label art and many
more test presses.

releasing records does not require full time employment. treating
it like it does is delusional. spending money on records is just
like spending money on gear or records or whatever your poison is.
it requires sacrifices. if youre dedicated, youll do it. if youre
not, you wont.

its a good point. "progressive" is whatever corporations want it
to be in order for them to sell more units. digital isnt as good
as analogue? call it progression! then people will buy all their
albums and movies again at inflated prices! you really should read
1984, BTW. i just re-read it for the first time in about 11 years
and its amazing how correctly orwell predicted the manipulation of
governments of the future. the guy was obviously brilliant. its
like the bush administration uses the book as an instructional
manual.

theres ways to ship cheaply. i mean you could also just go pick
them up yourself from archer for the cost of gas money.

that wasnt directed at you, that was a general commentary. i know
youve put out records as well as any number of other things. i
just find it funny that people promote, buy records, buy
equipment, but then complain that pressing records costs too much?
its the same idea, you spend money to make your contribution to
music. thats how it works.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} pressing vinyl is retarded

In my experience, generally you ship to distros on their own account, 
billed to them.  Worldwide distros have freight forwarders that you ship 
to in the us and its not too bad, and you can bill them for that 
shipping as well.

Though, shipping out promos tends to be the highest hidden cost, if you 
are sending them to people and distros all over the world it can get 
expensive, quickly.  Nearing a couple hundred bucks.

But yeah.. For $1500 you can get much more than what you were saying 
jbible.  We use archer and overhead is about $600 and after that records 
are $1.15 unit cost and $1.00 for extra tests.  75 promos + 720 records 
w/ 2 color labels, mastering, plating, jackets = 1500.   500 records + 
75 promos = 1245.  300 records + 75 promos (that's a lot of promos for 
only 300 press) = 1015.

Also distros should pay you at least 3.25-3.50 to start each.  Sell 500 
and you should break even.

I don't care how poor you are -- don't buy records, do drugs, drink or 
go out to dinner for a few months and almost anyone save enough to do 
their own vanity pressing of 500+ that sits in their basement for years 
to come!  Its really not hard and not that expensive to press a record.  
DIY you motherfuckers..

My only point was your lucky to break even on low quantity vinyl=20
pressing...especially if your a first timer. But thats a sacrifice you have=

to be willing to make going into it.

Where do you get your mastering/plateing done? Do you get it done right at=

Archer. How is there mastering? I just really trust Aardvark.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} pressing vinyl is retarded

  everyone should read 1984.  that way it makes politics that much
more amusing.  It's been my favorite book for years now, i pick it up
and just read random parts whenever i feel like getting into that 'my
government really sucks' mood.  the movie for 1984 doesnt do the book
justice, but it still is alright... makes much much more sense if
you've read the book and know what winston smith is thinking, instead
of just the things that go on physically.

and entropy, seriously just go off yourself with a rusty machete. =20

archer's mastering is expensive and i dont know any labels that
have used it that i know of. usually people use NSC or scratch
free, though ive seen "hot wax" on recent detroit records.

Haha the subject for the topic is awesome.  LOL...
Might not be safe for work.
If it is safe for your work and you show it to your boss and he gives
you a hearty laugh, a pat on the shoulder and a promotion I'd say you
are in an awesome career.

I AM playing on WRFL tonight with Trent Marshall.
He is covering a shift for someone.
Its 12am to 3am.  I'll be down there around 12 as soon as I get off of work=
. =20
It'll be ALL Drum and bass. =20

http://wrfl.uky.edu:9000/listen.pls

That's the link you click to listen to the show.
Its a winamp link so you have to winamp to make it work.

If you don't have winamp you can get winamp here
http://winamp.com/player/free.php

Or if you live in Lexington turn your dial, not your political
preference, all the way to the left to 88.1.
Starting at 12 midnight to 3am. =20

That is if you don't work a normal 9 to 5 job.
LOL...

on a club system...which sounds different then studio monitors.

See I am starting to think this "testing it on a crowd" thing is
bullshit.  If you are a good dj, you already know what people are
going to dance to.  You don't test the vinyl you buy do you?  Of
course not because you wouldnt have bought it if you didn't think it
was good, same deal.  I know most of the tunes that I have written in
the past are filler tunes because of my expirience as a dj, thats why
I don't bother testing them or sending them out to lables.  Basically
if you don't know, then let me save you the trouble, your tune sucks.

seriously though, how many times can you possibly have to do that?
the whole point of monitors is to be able to hear things clearly
so you will know how they translate.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: [BmoreStormin' Brainz] Re: How was Starscape?  How was Aftercare?

Hi guys!  Heads up!

Limited number of promos available right now.  These records have been imported
from Germany and are available RIGHT NOW!

The Dark Promo
A. Back Issues 8:25
B. Latest issues 5:43
Dark Techno

The Deep Promo
A1. Love at last 3:54
B1. heaven over cologne 7:06
Deep Hard trance

Each promo has received reviews and 5 stars overseas.  If I'm not mistaken,
there are 5 and 17 copies of each vinyl, respectively.  Unfortunately, audio is
not available for either of these tracks.  The price is an amazing $1.00 per
promo. It's a steal!  Shipping, unfortunately, is not included.  That will
probably be an extra $5.00, from experience in buying records.

Also, 6 copies of of the Rosendal Release available for $8.00.  I have this
single LP.  This is a good downtempo, chill-out house mix, and it's great music
to f*ck to. ;-D  There are three different tracks on this record that has
received positive responses in the lounge and online.  Buy the rosendal release
and get a promo record for free while suplies last... and believe me, these
records probably won't last very long.

Finally, for $8.00, you can get the RV aggelen Secret nights EP.

When you place an order for multiple records, save on shipping by having your
records shipped all at once--that should be a no-brainer.

If interested, please give my man Tony Russo a shout-out to purchase and/or to
obtain further information.  His contact information is below:

Subject: {pb-cle} Let's try this again... promo vinyl for sale

Hi guys!  I wanted to pass this along to the DJs and vinyl collectors.

My friend is selling a limited number of promos available right now.  These
records have been imported
from Germany!

The Dark Promo
A. Back Issues 8:25
B. Latest issues 5:43
Dark Techno

The Deep Promo
A1. Love at last 3:54
B1. heaven over cologne 7:06
Deep Hard trance

Each promo has received reviews and 5 stars overseas.  If I'm not mistaken,
there are 5 and 17 copies of each vinyl, respectively.  Unfortunately, audio is
not available for either of these tracks.  The price is an amazing $1.00 per
promo. It's a steal!  Shipping, unfortunately, is not included.  That will
probably be an extra $5.00, from experience in buying records.

Also, 6 copies of of the Rosendal Release available for $8.00.  I have this
single LP.  This is a good downtempo, chill-out house mix, and it's great music
to f*ck to. ;-D  There are three different tracks on this record that has
received positive responses in the lounge and online.  Buy the rosendal release
and get a promo record for free while suplies last... and believe me, these
records probably won't last very long.

Finally, for $8.00, you can get the RV aggelen Secret nights EP.

When you place an order for multiple records, save on shipping by having your
records shipped all at once--that should be a no-brainer.

If interested, please give my man Tony Russo a shout-out to purchase and/or to
obtain further information.  His contact information is below:

Tony Russo
Cobalt Recordings and PMR Records
Co-Owner

Uh, what?

"I bet you are fuck in bed would have been great with him"?

"I bet your fuck in bed would have been great with him"?

Neither makes sense.

I don't have any of these  =(

Gots to check Tipper, new to me.
And the Orb is one of my biggest influences  ever. 
I don't even have UFOrb though!
He released one , not sure the name , but I wasn't impressed  so I kind of 
dropped out.
 
I was impressed with Bikes and Triks because it sounded so  much like his 
usual (Adventures Beyond) that I'm lovin it.  It does lack in  some areas I

God I would love to check that show and get an autograph

Thanks for the info!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Final Scratch Vs Serato

when i check my tunes on a system...ill walk away from the booth and
actually listen for a min or so...thats the only way to get a good
reference...short of having a trusted ear in the crowd letting you know.

not to mention the fact that i can reference shit on 6 15s whenever i want
and sit perfectly triangulated at the critical distance.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Final Scratch Vs Serato

the whole point of monitors is so you can tell how the track will sound on a
majority of systems (radios, cars, tv's, etc)...no studio monitor can
replicate what a few thousand watts will do...what ive found is when i mix
down on monitors...my stuff is too bright for a club system...like painful
in the high end....so i gotta re-eq the whole thing or reset the faders and
mix-down again.

i know im not the only person with this problem...thats why proper studio
suites have 3 sets of monitors for referencing(one set is always a big
jamming set of speakers).

Which is the same as the mainstream music industry.

The artists make their money from touring, not from record sales.  But you
get tours and high fees from a hit record.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Another sound check (ANSWERS)

OK, since aparently people were too busy bickering about records vs cds, 
only one person actual did this (goose, and he got one right, but is the 
winner of absolutely nothing by default, though)

1.mp3 = turntable to iMic to laptop
2.mp3 = turntable to mixer to laptop
3.mp3 = turntable to mixer to iMic to laptop

1 was easy to figure out because there was a lot of record noise other 
two were really difficult.  Can hear a very slight difference but can't 
really tell which one is really better.  Was really impressed with the 
line in of the laptop, thought it would sound terrible compared to going 
through the iMic.  I'm almost leaning towards just plugging from the 
mixer into the laptop without the iMic (#2).  I'm not really sure why 
the third one's waveform is reversed and not really sure how to fix that 
aside from flipping it back in soundforge or something, if there's even 
a problem with it anyway since it sounds fine.  Only reason I'd use the 
third one (from mixer to imic to laptop) would be for the recording 
software it has which is really nice at splitting tracks up and stuff, 
but the inverted waveform worries me for some reason.

You may now go back to your vinyl/cd/mp3/tape/8 track/wheel to 
wheel/phonograph bickering

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

JAIA (Digital Structures . France) LIVE!
The act JAIA is the project of  the French producer Yannis Kamarinos, 
formed in 1995 with Jean-Michel Blanchet and first oriented  Psy-Trance 
and Downtempo.  Since 2000 Yannis is working alone under JAIA name,  and 
today JAIA.s music is more orientated to Progressive House and 
Progressive Trance (and still Downtempo too).  JAIA has already released 
an album .Blue Energy. in 1998 (Cross/EastWest/Nova Tekk), which has 
been re-released in 2000 on the Japanese label Dakini.  JAIA released 
several 12" singles too, as well as numerous tracks on various label 
compilations, such as  Island, Iboga, Wagram, Milan, Flying Rhino, 
T.I.P. World, and many others.  The new album "Fiction" will be released 
in May 2005 on Digital Structures.  Yannis has collaborated with other 
producers-DJ.s such as DADO, WIZY NOISE, and SILICON SOUND.  He has 
remixed famous artists like the French singer MYLENE FARMER . including 
her last two singles "C.est Une Belle Journée" and "Pardonne-Moi" 
(Polydor/Unive
 rsal) -
with BLUE PLANET CORPORATION, the Moroccan singer TYOUSSI 
(Fairway/SonyMusic), and the French pop band JPEX (Wagram). JAIA also 
has been remixed by TOTAL ECLIPSE, MINIL:OGUE, and JIMMY VAN M for 
example.  He is also working with Oneletronic, a company making sound 
libraries for cinema and TV, collaborating with other artists like JOHN

Greece.

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

featuring hundreds of performers from around the world. Continuing the 
tradition that began at the very start of the electronic music scene, 
Destiny returns with its boldest production to date and very special 
milestone - our 50th major event!

Over the past decade, some of the biggest names in dance music have 
graced the stages of WEMF. In total, over 200 artists are booked for 
2005. Two main stages cater to Trance, House, Techno, Breaks, DnB & 
Jungle with smaller sub stages providing hardcore, psychedelic and 
ambient beats to complete the full spectrum of electronic dance sounds.

Traveling to WEMF each year has become the thing to do for those who 
want an experience of a lifetime. In the past decade, well over 100,000 
people have experienced the WEMF phenomenon. License plates from 20 
states and 5 provinces were observed last year and busses were chartered

[whaaaa? a pgh party?]

P.U.M.P. (Pittsburgh Underground Music Production) is Pittsburgh's first
annual underground music celebration on 07.16.05. Department of Energy,
Nightbreed Productions, Koala-tea, Nightvision, Full House, Electrasoul,
and Death x Stereo are just some of the crews working to make this event
one to remember.

First, Nightbreed Productions and Department of NRG bring their
specialty to the table and made it possible for this event to be held in
a virgin venue.  This multi room WAREHOUSE with over 15,000 square feet
will provide you with adequate dancing space, multi room environments,
and most of all provide that underground feeling associated with
underground music.

Second, Koala-tea brings on their skills and makes it possible for some
of our big bookings for this show. Plus, Koala-tea is bringing out some
of their drum n bass talent, along with Pittsburgh's own Death x Stereo
crew, the drum n bass for this event will be off the hook.

Third, Electrasoul along with Electralight will be providing sound and
lighting for this event. With FOUR stages already confirmed and state of
the art lighting and visuals, this event holds lots of suprises for
everyone.

Last, local crews such as Nightvision and Full House represent most of
our local lineup for this event. Progressive House, break beats, techno,
all over the place, these crews will be sure to keep the crowd
movin...all night long.

Event runs from 9pm till 6am. Admission will be $20 all night plus on 
site, secure parking available. Vendors please contact Department of 
Energy at 412-708-0473 before May 31st. Any further questions please

Sat Jul 23                   LAWNCHAIR GENERALS                   Cleveland

Coming to Wish Saturday July 23rd

LawnChair Generals (Viva, Westbound, Lowdown)

Seattle transplants Peter Christianson and Carlos Mendoza, better known 
as the Lawnchair Generals, have been generating beats out of their 
self-made studio for the past two years. Based on the brief amount of 
time the duo has spent manning the controls, the success they have 
attained is staggering. As goes the old adage, it is quality, not 
quantity that breeds such success; along with their blinding talent, 
both behind the decks and in the studio, and a little luck thrown in for 
good measure, the Generals have blazed their way into the record crates 
of the world's top DJs and onto internationally distributed mixes 
compiled by the industry's most prolific jocks. "The egalitarian nature 
of this industry is what allows us to completely transcend the fact that 
we're from a town that has been mostly rock oriented," says Carlos. "It 
allows us to be on equal footing with people who have been making great 
house music for a long time."

Lawn Chair Generals likely represent the next creative event in 
underground house music, a sound carefully crafted unlike much of the 
slapped together economy of the dance music prevelant to date. Carlos 
Mendoza and Peter Christianson met in 2000 and almost immediatelly began 
experimenting with the possibilities of house music. Their very first 
experiment yielded their first release on Viva Recordings, "The Great 
Escape". The pair was pleasantly surprised when this release garnered 
the praise of national and worldwide heavyweights alike. Charted in 
publications by the likes of Mark Farina and Colin Dale of the BBC, and 
broken out on dance floors by Johnny Fiasco, DJ Heather, Doc Martin, Rob 
Mello and more all over the world, their "West Coast meets Chicago" 
sound has garnered this pair more attention than they expected...Remixes 
for Viva, Deepfunk and Amenti extend this duo's sound to the works of 
other emerging underground talents such as Hanna, Rhythm Slaves and 
Alexander East.

Bailey
[[[Metalheadz, 1Xtra, Swerve, Intasound]]]
UK

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the 
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats 
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey.s South London 
stomping ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, 
DJing at house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the 
mellow hip hop of the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and 
harder; Acid House . the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the 
rave scene. It was on this acid house path, in around .91 that he found 
a turning for hardcore, inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of 
this road he entered the door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate 
station .Energy FM.. It was his ability on that very station that 
impressed Kemistry and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play 
at one of the first Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. 
Through moving on the circuit Bailey joined forces with other 
influential South London selectors and MC.s, forming the Inta Natty crew 
which consisted of himself, Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known 
for managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin. Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm 
and Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by 
playing in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, 
Canada, America and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has 
been all over the mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some 
of which include: One Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric 
Live, The End, Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldie.s club 
Metalheadz and Fabio.s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people 
want has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting 
line up, every Sunday night (11pm . 1am) and in 2003 he won the award 
for .Best Radio Show. at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for 
many projects including mixed CD.s for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of 
Sound, France.s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass 
record store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size 
& A Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja 
and in 2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing 
tracks from cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he 
has the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an 
impression and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ.s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to . 
recognition and respect.

He is the inventor of the break beat.

I did an interview with him at WRUW two or so years ago.  His story 
is actually somewhat tragic.  He got into a bad contract very early 
in his career and 'lost' the right to most of the mbm songs that made 
him popular.  The label (something to do with X-T-C released the 
material and didn't pay him much/enough.  The contract lasted for 10 
years or so.  He couldn't release his own material!!!  He could 
perform it live which is at least some consolation.  He was genuinely 
a nice guy and his music goes back to the early early 80s - no drum 
machines just power drums.

Old picture of his studio:
http://www.digitalchemist.com/mbm/history/home_studio.html

I can't find a newer one but it looks like a space shuttle...

i think that there are a couple kinds of formats of minidisk, one
not having lossy compression on it. they make minidisk
multitracks, a guy i knew a while back had one. 

i have records that were mastered from cassette tape.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Final Scratch Vs Serato


You can do PCM on Hi-MD units, I can't remember if my regular old one does
PCM or not. I'm actually kinda down for the Hi-MD units, if I had the cash
to blow on one I'd be all about it.

On that note, I actually use my MD unit more than my iPod, which collects
a lot of dust. If it weren't for that sonic stage crap, I'd have never
bought the iPod in the first place. The MD is super for field recordings
and such, I love it so. You can't top the battery life, I think I've had
the same AA battery in it for 3 months.

- Mike

hmm. MD... my initials. gives new meaning to my MD unit.

I was thinking about going....not sure if I want to
because I will be at WEMF the next week, and most of

does it sound like muddy, runny poo? given the headroom (or lack thereof) i would think it would lack a lot of the crispness that carries over from 1/4" analog mastering...

hahaha, did you say that most of the lineup will be at WEMF? have you been 
to a WEMF in the past few years? most of the lineup doesn't show up!

of course bang IS a local 13 party, but they have more credibility than the 
WEMF people in my eyes at this point.

Hot shizz.

Yeah Mr. Jack was definitely the hot shizz.  I still listen to his
stuff that he released way back in 97-98 and its still the hotness.  I
love how he had those old samples from frequency nerds who would
explain different sounds, frequencies, wavelengths, etc.  Good times.

analog mastering...

theo parrish's "1987" ep is mastered from cassette tape, and it
sounds pretty good to me. ive heard the basic channel label was
all mastered from cassette as well (and id guess maybe the rhythm
and sound stuff too by the sound, but not the burial mix or the
maurizio stuff, theyre too clean. the main street stuff might be,
especially the last one. the first 2 sound really crappy on the
vinyl pressing, lord knows if that was intentional or not. i love
it either way) but those guys are so on the hush hush that i
havent been able to confirm it. it certainly does sound likely. 

i mix down to a $5 vintage akai cassette deck. its the bomb.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Final Scratch Vs Serato

cassette mastering really comes down to a few things.
1. clean heads.
2. competence.
3. quality equipment

something mixed down to a nice 3head cassette deck will sound better then
something mixed down to a 15dollar boombox deck...it can be done..but most
people only do it out of necessity..all those people u mentioned bought
nicer 2tracks when they made some scrill...why...cuz you get what you pay
for....something mixed to an otari or studer half-track is gonna sound a
million times better then something mixed down to the most top of the line
nachamichi cassette deck...there is just more real estate for the signal to
live on with a half-track then with an 1/8" cassette.

hehe, moritz von oswald of basic channel is part of a long line of
very rich (like super old money) very powerful european royals. i
think he mixed down to cassette because he liked the sound.

of course! but lo-fi analogue shit is still nice sounding.
honestly, aside from samples and some 12 bit FM i just dont see
much need for any digital signal path. i prefer analogue
degredation over digital. 

>oh and btw...i hardly even use my 1/4" deck...its just too much

>the ass...its constantly fucking up in some way when im recording..

thats why i went with the $5 vintage cassette deck. if something
goes horribly wrong, throw it out and buy another. people just be
throwing them shits away. and it still beats the sound of digital.
plus you can get real nasty recording to old ass busted cassettes.

Subject: {pb-cle} Saturday June 25th - Woody McBride and more - $5

Reminder for the show on Saturday...

"The US is one of the few places in the world where Electronica is an 
either unfamiliar or a suspicious word to the mainstream. But then I 
think, "why are we complaining? - we want it to stay "Real" and 
"Underground" anyway - maybe it is simply a cultural difference and 
not ignorance and oppression? Or perhaps this blockade against new 
ideas is the fuel that makes the US a creative place?"  - Woody 
McBride

$5 over   $7 under   9:00pm
B Side Liquor Lounge (below the Grog Shop in Coventry)
2785 Euclid Hts Blvd

Featuring: Woody McBride (Minnesota), Mike Parker (Buffalo), Dub Mos 
Papa (Detroit), and t3 (Cleveland).  Live video mix by IndoorFlash 
and custom subs by T.F.L.  More details at 
http://www.midnightmixer.com

Big thanks to Grand Poo Bas (http://www.poo-bas.com) for logistics 
that make the show possible...Twice!

Tune to the Raver's Edge on WRUW 91.1 FM at 6:00pm to hear Mike 
Parker spin a guest mix and tell you about his life of all work and 
no play or was it all play and no work day job as an art teacher and 
night job as a multi media artist.  Thank you to Vitruvius for making 
this happen!

Dub Mos Papa is a new solo project of Matthew Ulrich who will be 
making his third appearance in Cleveland.  Not as abrasive as 
Autechre, less coy than R.D.J., more contour than Kid 606.  The hour 
mix is a debut of original digital dub composed in the studio and 
re-cut in front of you.

For one whole year the show has gone on.  Some hands grew tired and 
others strong...

Ramzi

Its in this mix.  Its toward the end.  Actually the vocals of the
bootleg only seem to come in for a few bars.  Maybe its just the way
he mixed it, but hopefully its the full track.  Its a mix full of

yeah i was first considering both, but I have a dr appointment  
saturday morning and since I don't have any contacts and the ones I'm  
wearing aren't going to last long, figure this would be more  
important :)

btw, emailed woody mcbride about his latest mix cd and said he'll  
bring some of those and his smily shirts for sale for those  
interested and don't want to pay shipping.

Subject: {pb-cle} Feelgood last night 6/24


location - Tramp, the warehouse district.
a place where Chach-y (sp?) men who wear blouses come out and try to rub up 
against you. God cleveland rocks.

definately worth $5 though (i would've paid that to run into Casey & Ray)

I've never been good w/ 'formal reviews'  but highlights of the night 
include...
*running into Casey in the bathroom
*seeing RayG for the first time in like what 2yrs?
*Live saxaphonist accompaning Charles
*Feelgood was pretty cool too ;)
*free parking
*vanilla stoli and cokes
*actually DANCING, even if i am uncoordinated and havent really moved that 
way in 2+yrs
*Crystal & Monica from cincy

lowlights of the night include...
*creepy men trying to dance with us and them not getting the hint after we 
stop dancing and walk away from them.... that we are soooo not interested.
*actually.... that's probably it.  these cheese-factor in cleveland seems to 
have risen since i've last been out

hope everyone is enjoying their weekend.
luv
becca

Honestly...anyone that likes techno in the littlest bit within the whole region who didn't have a really good excuse for missing this is an idiot.  Granted I'm joking somewhat there....but still.  WOW. 
 
I really don't think I've heard music like that in Cleveland EVER. Let alone at b-sides?!?!  I can only imagine what he would have done to a huge crowd if he played that good for a small group of heads.

That's not really saying much as often as we get headliners here. 
Anywho I'll second that awesomeness.  And I actually got the pictures up 
already!!  Not many, but o well.

BTW, if you can get his cd, do it.  You can send him an email from his 
website and get it that way.  Still waiting for the album to come out on 
vinyl

Really Tom, you shouldn't write things like that.  You never know what can 
happen to you......  (karma thing)  Anyways  I was just forwarding an email 
to the group to what everyone thought about erasing god from historical 
fact.  Why does the letter upset you?

actually i do know what will happen to me karmically: not a damn
thing. the same thing that has happened to me karmically my entire
life. as a matter of fact, the more fucked up shit i say and do,
the better my life is. who knew? 

>Anyways  I was just forwarding an email 
>to the group to what everyone thought about erasing god from

>fact.  Why does the letter upset you?

the idea that anyone cares about references to mythical characters
upsets me because it means people are fucking idiots. which isnt
really suprising, just continually disappointing. theres plenty of
things that one actually should worry about, that shit isnt one of
them.

Wow.

1. The WWII Memorial isn't in Arlington; it's directly between the
Lincoln and Washington Monuments.
2. "Yesterday, December 7,  1941-- a date which will live in
infamy--the United States of America  was suddenly and deliberately
attacked.  So help us God."  was never in FDR's speech.

The quote on the memorial, indeed on the pacific side: "No matter how
long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the
American people, in their righteous might, will win through to
absolute victory."

A few sentences later, at the very end of his speech: "With confidence
in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people,
we will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God."


I find it odd that this message is a victim of the historical rewrite
that it's trying to warn about.

Subject: {pb-cle} after "ravin out" at the ledges this weekend

Post rave report:
OMG, shit got fucked up, but I had a damn good time anyways.

Memorable performance:
The magic vanishing stages
The Undercover K two hour house marathon.
The Darryl/Nox/Dangermouse triple tag
Boompsie
Cloud 10 vs Darbe
Evasion
Cloud 10 at his campsite after the music was shut off
Alex Forte
The guitar player in the sewer pipe
The magic appearing renegade stages
DVS (plays house while surrounded on all sides by junglists)
9MM

Lets do this again next month...

It went like this...........
    The promoter had zero cash on hand and *thought* they could get away 
on pre-sale cash to pay their bills. In the end they didnt pay their 
sound and light bill
so the official party was over before it ever started. Now on Fri night 
the owners where being dicks because of the bullshit promoters and 
collected ours and the rest of the generators people had brought. But 
finnaly early on Sat we spoke with the owner and because of the fact we 
had all been screwed by the promoters they agreed to release the 
generators and let everyone setup so people could have a party of their 
own ;) I'd like to thank everyone that stopped down (warzone. far back 
corner stage). So ya theirs the scoop!

Damn.  Seems like shit never changes...   everyone just  wants to make bank 
instead of having a good time.  I say if ya don't have  the money to spend or 
loose, then don't do it.
Or, just use drug money to pay for the thing  ;)     This is not a new 
concept.  A rave is a rave.  No drugs, no  money, no promotion, no ravey   =(  
Should of promoted better in PA & NY and did some food  vending to cover it.  
But this is what ya get when the am's step in, and  run the scene into the 
ground even more.
Its a shame.  Someone someday will step up to the plate and bring  it I 
suppose.
Where are the rich spoiled kids from Shaker/Cleve Hts, Brecksville when you  
need em>?
Or eccentric business owners with money to burn?  Oh well...
The underground is like roaches, we never die!

Starscape this year was *much* better than either of the past two, I
think; fewer thugs, less fucked-up looking people, a bunch of new
faces, and (from my view) better music this year.

Shit, I remember when Spontaneous did a gig in East Cleve, in a old old  
warehouse.
Shit, It was unbelievable, and it was free from what I remember.
And there were even Cleveland cops there directing traffic and protecting  
the party.
_F@cking_ (mailto:F@cking)  great stuff.  Connections  help.

I believe you are talking about the first 4/20.  It was at the 
General Electric warehouses that I believe are on or near Nela Park 
or Noble road.  I've driven by it a few times since then.

They threw a party called "no shit" in the same
warehouse they threw "4/20", but it was almost a year
before...I think.... All I remember was when Oni went
on (this is when he spun old school breaks) the whole
place went nuts. I was standing towards the back and I
turned around to see 3000 heads all bouncing up and
down in sync. It lived up to the name by far....

tried posting this a bit back, didn't seem to get through....  *shrug*

so candy ravers got made fun of all the time? i can't wait till clowing
catches on.   oh my......


http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/magazine/19CLOWN.html


Slabs of bass beat split the air, seeming to warp the walls as the Rice
Track Family started dancing at the Silverado Park Teen Center one Sunday
in May. Outside, dusk was falling on a mellow evening in Long Beach,
Calif., the sort of night when fluke winds swirl in from the desert and
ruffle the fronds of the royal palms, rousing the rats from the crowns.

The tune on the boom box was ''Piggy Bank,'' by 50 Cent. As Rod Soriano,
whose dance name is Hot Rod, cranked up the volume, the other boys at the
rec center started to pop their chests and sway. Abruptly, each in turn,
they began to whip their arms around, hunching their shoulders, bending
their bodies toward the sound and the violent lyrics, trancelike, as if
some sort of battle was about to begin.

They shut their eyes then and let their heads nod. As the beats filled the
room, the dancers started quivering and then caroming, at first
delicately, then spasmodically, then picking up velocity in an alarming
but strangely graceful way. They looked like rubber bands do when the
tautened elastic is sprung. So submerged were the dancers in the dance
that it was not clear how they managed to avoid crashing into the
cinder-block walls or into the sharp-cornered foosball table or, for that
matter, me.

The dancers took turns showing off their moves, first a teenager called
Chris (Pokeey) Tanedo and then Marvin (Junior Pokeey) Salvador and then
Raf (Young Pokeey) Ocampo and then Mark (Baby Pokeey) Irang and then Cliff
(Little Pokeey) Sung and then Laurence (Solow) Gogit, the only member of
the group whose nickname is not a play on the Tagalog word for ''scar.''

The dance they were demonstrating is called krumping, equal parts break
dance, pantomimed battle and demonic possession. As break dancing did 25
years ago in the South Bronx, krumping arose spontaneously some time in
the last decade in neighborhoods in Long Beach and throughout South
Central Los Angeles. And, just as break dancing was confined at its
beginnings to a fragment of a New York borough then in ruins, krumping is
still mostly unknown beyond the freeways that border these ragged areas of
L.A.

I just watched it, that's great.  Go ahead and take "erasing god from 
historical fact."  I first put the email letter on the list to see if anyone 
got the errors, but it seems some people wanted to dive to deep into the 
letter.  Dean was all over that.  Must be a history major or around 75 years 
old.

For those of you who've vibed on Ian's sets the past couple years, 
he'll be in town this weekend; hope you'll join the family reunion 
for one hell of a party...

saturday, july 2 :: mix. @ abbasso

HeadRush Music presents Our House with Deviant and Ian

funky and soulful house music all night long...

Who's Ian?

This grown-up kid is the definition of old-school, and he plays 
the realest of house music. Hear the veteran at work as he 
recreates the vibe like it used to be: Head-bopping, ass-shaking, 
lip-puckering soulfulness. After more than 15 years at the decks, 
you know his roots run deep. He currently resides at "The Family 
Sessions" on Thursday with the Gomez brother in Hartford, CT.

You'll remember him from his kick-ass Summer Series sets during 
our nights with Mazi, John Howard (twice) and Pete Moss here in 
Cleveland, as well as his sets at our "From New York with Love" 
event and Twist's 4th of July BBQ in 2003.

Join a minister of brotherly love as we preach a gospel of house 
for all ..

Saturday, July 2

No cover; Doors open at 10pm
21+ please

abbasso (inside bottoms up)
1222 prospect ave, east of e9th st, downtown cleveland
216-375-5425

Note: the upstairs Bottoms Up bar will be closed. Enter Abbasso 
through the Bolivar Rd. entrance and head down the stairs. Just 
follow the beats...

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/magazine/19CLOWN.html


Slabs of bass beat split the air, seeming to warp the walls as the Rice
Track Family started dancing at the Silverado Park Teen Center one Sunday
in May. Outside, dusk was falling on a mellow evening in Long Beach,
Calif., the sort of night when fluke winds swirl in from the desert and
ruffle the fronds of the royal palms, rousing the rats from the crowns.

The tune on the boom box was ''Piggy Bank,'' by 50 Cent. As Rod Soriano,
whose dance name is Hot Rod, cranked up the volume, the other boys at the
rec center started to pop their chests and sway. Abruptly, each in turn,
they began to whip their arms around, hunching their shoulders, bending
their bodies toward the sound and the violent lyrics, trancelike, as if
some sort of battle was about to begin.

They shut their eyes then and let their heads nod. As the beats filled the
room, the dancers started quivering and then caroming, at first
delicately, then spasmodically, then picking up velocity in an alarming
but strangely graceful way. They looked like rubber bands do when the
tautened elastic is sprung. So submerged were the dancers in the dance
that it was not clear how they managed to avoid crashing into the
cinder-block walls or into the sharp-cornered foosball table or, for that
matter, me.

The dancers took turns showing off their moves, first a teenager called
Chris (Pokeey) Tanedo and then Marvin (Junior Pokeey) Salvador and then
Raf (Young Pokeey) Ocampo and then Mark (Baby Pokeey) Irang and then Cliff
(Little Pokeey) Sung and then Laurence (Solow) Gogit, the only member of
the group whose nickname is not a play on the Tagalog word for ''scar.''

The dance they were demonstrating is called krumping, equal parts break

<<I find it odd that this message is a victim of the historical rewrite that

odd? maybe...
ironic? sure....
surprising? no fucking way.

this is the typical modus operandi for both these email chain letters and
the Christian Right's battle plan...

tom's reaction is the PRECISE thing they're hoping for: to make people out
to be "God-haters".
(nevermind the fact that he actually IS one of the God-haters. most people
aren't quite as polarized as tom.)

this is the kind of shit that depresses me about being a Christian...that i
have to be lumped in with the kind of inbred fuck who writes this shit...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} after "ravin out" at the ledges this weekend

Just wanted to say Ihad an awsome time out at the ledges.  Only got
charged the $10 park fee.  Would have enjoyed camping out with a bunch
of freaks worth it on its own, but there was some good renegade
action.  I got there and Boombsie was tear'n it up.  Listened to some
dnb people deep up the camp site.  Who were those people up there,
anyone?  There was some pretty good dark stuff being thrown down.  It
was good to see list folk, and hang out and talk synth & computer
shop.  Yes, I'm a geek.

Sorry I missed everyone in the morning and afternoon, I was out in the
quary.  I love swimming there.  I was cliff diving at the ledge for a
couple hours and swam the whole quarry just about.  The owner was
doing one and a half gainers and hand-stand flips off the ledge.  It
was a beautiful day.  I have no idea why that water is so nice and
clean with all the dirty hippies that have been at that park.  I guess
its because its spring fed.  Its the clearest water anywhere that I
know of.  Oh yeah - and no leaches to be found, although i did find a
few snails.

If anyone wants to go out there on the weekend someday just to swim
and jump off the ledge like a nut, hit me up.

Oh yeah - I had to get a tetanus shot from that nail that got me from
the skids I used for firewood.  Good thing I was drink'n or that could
have really hurt, lol.  It was worth it though.

good times, good times!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fuse-In (last post regarding I promise)

fyi, I'm starting to mirror these off my server.  I'm rather limited  
to the number of downloads and filespace, but it's better than  
downloading off tek-know.net at like 3k/sec :)  Right now just have  
mistress barbara's set on there, I'll get more up there over the  
course of the day.  the bandwidth limits get reset tomorro, so pretty  
much anyone that tries today will get it.  Just don't post this on a  
bunch of lists :)

http://files.vrillusions.com/

I'll make the site look more pretty later

fyi, I'm starting to mirror these off my server.  I'm rather limited
to the number of downloads and filespace, but it's better than
downloading off tek-know.net at like 3k/sec :)  Right now just have
mistress barbara's set on there, I'll get more up there over the
course of the day.  the bandwidth limits get reset tomorro, so pretty
much anyone that tries today will get it.  Just don't post this on a
bunch of lists :)

http://files.vrillusions.com/

I'll make the site look more pretty later

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Stay up Forever Collective . Hydraulix . Apex
Deck technician, production wizard and mainstay of the acid techno 
scene. Initially helping to kick start the London techno movement with 
the Liberator DJs, D.A.V.E.s focus has shifted from his earlier acidic 
productions to a darker style of techno which is reflected on his own 
labels HYDRAULIX and APEX.  When he rocks the house you.ll know why 
D.A.V.E. was recently voted into DJ Magazine.s world.s top 100 chart!

DJ MICRO . Long Island

1992 as resident DJ at Caffeine in Long Island and has continued around 
the globe and back.  His skills as a DJ, producer and remixer have 
built his reputation as one of the most exciting talents around. This 
local hero will be deputing his new CD,  .TECH MIX 5., with an official 
kick-off party at BANG and you.re invited!

D-FUSE  - Texas

His DJ sets include true live performance. Adding a unique angle to his 
shows, D-Fuse uses the Roland HPD 15 Handsonic to play live percussion 
during his sets. This man truly interacts with the crowd on a different 
level!

featuring hundreds of performers from around the world. Continuing the 
tradition that began at the very start of the electronic music scene, 
Destiny returns with its boldest production to date and very special 
milestone - our 50th major event!

Over the past decade, some of the biggest names in dance music have 
graced the stages of WEMF. In total, over 200 artists are booked for 
2005. Two main stages cater to Trance, House, Techno, Breaks, DnB & 
Jungle with smaller sub stages providing hardcore, psychedelic and 
ambient beats to complete the full spectrum of electronic dance sounds.

Traveling to WEMF each year has become the thing to do for those who 
want an experience of a lifetime. In the past decade, well over 100,000 
people have experienced the WEMF phenomenon. License plates from 20 
states and 5 provinces were observed last year and busses were chartered

[whaaaa? a pgh party?]

P.U.M.P. (Pittsburgh Underground Music Production) is Pittsburgh's first
annual underground music celebration on 07.16.05. Department of Energy,
Nightbreed Productions, Koala-tea, Nightvision, Full House, Electrasoul,
and Death x Stereo are just some of the crews working to make this event
one to remember.

First, Nightbreed Productions and Department of NRG bring their
specialty to the table and made it possible for this event to be held in
a virgin venue.  This multi room WAREHOUSE with over 15,000 square feet
will provide you with adequate dancing space, multi room environments,
and most of all provide that underground feeling associated with
underground music.

Second, Koala-tea brings on their skills and makes it possible for some
of our big bookings for this show. Plus, Koala-tea is bringing out some
of their drum n bass talent, along with Pittsburgh's own Death x Stereo
crew, the drum n bass for this event will be off the hook.

Third, Electrasoul along with Electralight will be providing sound and
lighting for this event. With FOUR stages already confirmed and state of
the art lighting and visuals, this event holds lots of suprises for
everyone.

Last, local crews such as Nightvision and Full House represent most of
our local lineup for this event. Progressive House, break beats, techno,
all over the place, these crews will be sure to keep the crowd
movin...all night long.

Event runs from 9pm till 6am. Admission will be $20 all night plus on 
site, secure parking available. Vendors please contact Department of 
Energy at 412-708-0473 before May 31st. Any further questions please

http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/

A Teknival is a free non-commercial weekend-long gathering, a 
celebration of the DIY (do it yourself) attitude, and an experiment in 
non-hierarchical organization. The festival encourages group autonomy 
and self-sufficiency.

Teknival is free from an entrance fee, but also from authority and 
leadership. Each individual or group is free to get involved however 
they want, for the love of what they do.
Ontario.s 2005 Teknival will take place July 14-18, *NEW* Location 
southeast of Bancroft area. Some pics of the location here!

Driving directions will be released in early July

it is LEGAL for us to be on Crown Land provided we play by some simple, 
and often complimentary rules.
1) the regular laws apply regardless of permit
2) no permanent damage or changes are allowed without a permit
3) no profit may be made on Crown Land without permit
4) we can be there for as long as 3 weeks
5) it is for use by all members of the public, which means we can not 
limit access to it and must share it!

so the law supports the gift-exchange free spirited essence of teknival!

Bring enough food, water, shelter and supplies for yourself and everyone 
you bring up. Get together with friends into camps to share resources 
and responsibility.

Sat Jul 23                   LAWNCHAIR GENERALS                   Cleveland

Coming to Wish Saturday July 23rd

LawnChair Generals (Viva, Westbound, Lowdown)

Seattle transplants Peter Christianson and Carlos Mendoza, better known 
as the Lawnchair Generals, have been generating beats out of their 
self-made studio for the past two years. Based on the brief amount of 
time the duo has spent manning the controls, the success they have 
attained is staggering. As goes the old adage, it is quality, not 
quantity that breeds such success; along with their blinding talent, 
both behind the decks and in the studio, and a little luck thrown in for 
good measure, the Generals have blazed their way into the record crates 
of the world's top DJs and onto internationally distributed mixes 
compiled by the industry's most prolific jocks. "The egalitarian nature 
of this industry is what allows us to completely transcend the fact that 
we're from a town that has been mostly rock oriented," says Carlos. "It 
allows us to be on equal footing with people who have been making great 
house music for a long time."

Lawn Chair Generals likely represent the next creative event in 
underground house music, a sound carefully crafted unlike much of the 
slapped together economy of the dance music prevelant to date. Carlos 
Mendoza and Peter Christianson met in 2000 and almost immediatelly began 
experimenting with the possibilities of house music. Their very first 
experiment yielded their first release on Viva Recordings, "The Great 
Escape". The pair was pleasantly surprised when this release garnered 
the praise of national and worldwide heavyweights alike. Charted in 
publications by the likes of Mark Farina and Colin Dale of the BBC, and 
broken out on dance floors by Johnny Fiasco, DJ Heather, Doc Martin, Rob 
Mello and more all over the world, their "West Coast meets Chicago" 
sound has garnered this pair more attention than they expected...Remixes 
for Viva, Deepfunk and Amenti extend this duo's sound to the works of 
other emerging underground talents such as Hanna, Rhythm Slaves and 
Alexander East.

Bailey
[[[Metalheadz, 1Xtra, Swerve, Intasound]]]
UK

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the 
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats 
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey.s South London 
stomping ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, 
DJing at house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the 
mellow hip hop of the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and 
harder; Acid House . the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the 
rave scene. It was on this acid house path, in around .91 that he found 
a turning for hardcore, inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of 
this road he entered the door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate 
station .Energy FM.. It was his ability on that very station that 
impressed Kemistry and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play 
at one of the first Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. 
Through moving on the circuit Bailey joined forces with other 
influential South London selectors and MC.s, forming the Inta Natty crew 
which consisted of himself, Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known 
for managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin. Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm 
and Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by 
playing in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, 
Canada, America and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has 
been all over the mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some 
of which include: One Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric 
Live, The End, Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldie.s club 
Metalheadz and Fabio.s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people 
want has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting 
line up, every Sunday night (11pm . 1am) and in 2003 he won the award 
for .Best Radio Show. at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for 
many projects including mixed CD.s for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of 
Sound, France.s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass 
record store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size 
& A Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja 
and in 2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing 
tracks from cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he 
has the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an 
impression and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ.s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to . 
recognition and respect.
