notice that in india cows walk the streets and it is not altogether 
uncommon for people to defecate in the streets.........there is a reason 
for that and its because the difference in economic status has been so 
imbedded into their culture as being unchangeable, thus the people see 
nothing wrong with the difference in castes...... in india it is a 
cultural and religious belief that your caste is where you belong in 
life.....not quite compareable.....and yeah, i see that there is less of 
a problem with security of ones valubles in other countries, but that 
has to do with the culture involved....i think america's problem is 
based on the "american dream" of being poor and then making millions of 
dollars....it is really a distorted vision of how our corporations 
actually work.....every now and then, a person will make it big in the 
business world, but is often bought out by the larger 
corporations......the point is that everywhere there are starving and 
poor people because of corporate powers.....now, whether or not the 
people take the problem into their own hands is dependant on the 
culture, but because there isnt stealing or complaint, doesnt mean that 
there isnt a problem with the economic distribution....
im tired and need sleep......

Hey, here's something i think many people will be interested to hear.
This summer at the 2 day Tibetian Freedom Concert i've heard a rumor
that KRAFTWERK will be performing, oh and this happens in DC, kinda close
if your thinking of going :) But can anybody confirm this, i mean i can 
definitely see this as being the truth!!!!! (hopefully). Something to think 
about!! If true i know i'll be there, Kraftwerk plus a good cause, ahhhhh!!!!
I may be there regardless though, i dunno. Okay im done...................

"Cosmic rays are very energetic atomic nuclei accelerated in interstellar 
space; they diffuse inward in the heliosphere through the solar wind's
electric and magnetic fields and are observed on the Earth and by spacecraft

> I highly recomend TRIBE. I know the promoter and hes totally legit. If

i recommend tribe too. i have never heard of the promoters of entropy, has
anybody? and $15 is kind of a high price for 5 DJs, 1 PA, and a second
room that hasn't been confirmed. i know the promoter of transformation all
too well (i've already posted about the shady stuff he has done), and
what's up with booking such talentless crap as "Superstar DJ Dimitri" and
wilhelm k? might as well count them as money thrown away (this stuff
happens way too often, in general). but the good news is collective
intelligence are very cool, i know walt and melissa, they are awesome =]
and their parties are always full of so much vibe. so go to tribe, i will
try to go to it.

Any Lost In Space fans out there gonna see the movie this friday?  It looks
pretty sweet, if actually watched how corny the original series was compared
to this movie.  The soundtrack looks to be pretty good to, hopefully with a
new rendition of the Lost In Space theme song on it!!

This may be a rare situation in which it would definitely be worth
rescheduling one of these parties.  The promoters should get together are
discuss this, because I can almost guarantee that no one is going to do well
with such a split crowd.  Combining would be nice, but somewhat unfeasible.  I
hope something is able to be worked out.

WHat do u mean the promoter of "Transformation" is shady? I would like to know
because i am playing there.  I do agree that Wilhelm K is a waste of money,
but that's because He has never been anything but a snotty dick to me ever
since the first time i met him. As far as i know the guy from "Badass" is
allright, and I know Rob RIddum VERY well, and he is a great guy. Please let
me know

Oh my gosh!!!  I LOVE "Lost in Space"!!!  I watched it all summer when I
was in high school!  It was on the Sci-Fi Channel.  That darned Dr. Smith,
he always lands on his feet!  What an annoying little fellow!  I'm kind of
wary of seeing this new take on that wonderful campy series.  It just
looks like it's going to be all dressed up!  I see the ads for "LiS" and I
think "Starship Troopers".  It was entertaining and all but I guess I
expected more.  Excuse me for having cultured tastes.  I love sci-fi, but
lately so much of it seems to be so plastic and all special effects
tricks.  Whatever happened to substance.  Have you noticed the quantity of
(broad term) electronic music in sci-fi, lately?  As if in the future
there are no more genres of music...Mozart and Haydn have been eliminated
and the world of rock'n'roll has been obliterated.  It's as if the only
way to go is into the weird world of electronica!  Except for Star Trek
because Star Trek is perfect.

Wed Apr 08                   LOWEST OF THE LOW                   Pittsburgh

[sounds interesting, but somewhat off-topic???]

Invisible Reoords is pleased to announce the "Lowest of the Low" 1998
North American tour
featuring 5 main bands complimented by special guests at various points
in the tour.

"Not Breathing" will open the evening with its blend of hard techno and
experimental noise.

"Bagman" is the side project of Lee "Bastard" Fraser of Sheep on Drugs.
Lee remains one of the most prominent artists working in the field of
jungle and electronic music.

"F.M. Einheit" of Einsturzende Neubauten will make a rare North America
appearance with his 4 piece band.  Industrial madness.

"Scorn" - Dub terrorist Mick Harris' group Scorn has recieved critical
support and has established a wide audience for his pioneering ambient
dub.

"Pigface"  - if your familiar with the old; this is ALOT different,
ambient and danceable with some of the old thrown in too.  In addition
to the usual suspects including Martin Atkins, Charles Levi (My Life
with the TKK), Bob Dog, Curse Mackey (Evil Mothers) and Meg Lee Chin,
three other performers have been confirmed:  Gus Ferguson (Test Dept and
Dead Can Dance), Vas Kallas (Hanzel und Gretyl) and Jared Hendrickson
(Chemlab).  Additional contributors TBA.

    The evening will be seamless...with respect to your time, money,
ears and eyes; this event will be coming to you complete with an ultra
low end sound system and state of the art visual manipulations (Genesis
P. Orridge) to stimulate and already overstimulated audience. This is
not to be missed.

>then JunglAlien hasn't mastered the "art".  By the way, speaking of Hackers
>(the movie), none of the tones work in the U.S. anymore. and as for
>Junglalien, next time, research your project before getting your hands dirty,
>because it IS a felony." Send replies to: FACESTATIC@aol.com  NOT me. thanks.

The tones most certainly do work in verios places in the US.  
I can name two payphones near craig street in oakland that work just fine.
As well as one on carnegie mellon campus.
Or they did 1 year ago so unless the payphones have been replaced there is
no reason that they shouldnt work anymore.

Some technical information (then ill stop the public version of the thread
before I get reamed for being off topic :)

The tones used in hackers were not correct if anyone thought that (i hope
not).
If you are using a pure tone generator then for best results put a couple
of cleanexes between the speaker and the headset if the tones are TOO good
the phone company will notice.  An operator once told me she 'knew' because
their phones dont make the tones that clear. Hehe.  You can also help the
situation by scraping your real change on the coin slot, occasionaly this
sounds like a coin 'kachink' to the operator. or drop a penny in just
before the quarter tones.

In general you need to find a COCOT (Company owned coin operated telephone).
These are phones that are not directly owned by the phone company in the
area (usually AT&T) but owned by a third party that then pays at&t for the
phoneline.  They keep a chunk of the money.  Nearly any phone that has high
rates is a COCOT, since the last time I used a payphone in pgh the going
local rate was still a quarter for the initial deposit (this was several
months ago) if the deposit is higher (say 30cents as I have seen in one or
two places) then it is probably a COCOT.  


A good way to check if its possible to redbox a telephone is to drop in a
quarter and see if you can hear the tones on the headset. If you cant then
its unlikely it will work but may. If you can then there is a good chance
that you can.  The question is whether or not the phone turns off the
mouthpeace prior to making the connection.  Many phones, especially cocots
dont turn it off because they want ot make money off of the people who have
legitamite dialers for stored numbers, such as watches, personal dialers
and some laptop modems.  

Now if you can hear the tones on coin drop and it still doesnt work. Some
phones will turn on the mouthpiece after an initial contact so you may need
to drop in a nickle or quarter to start the connection then try the redbox. 

For best results of making things a little cheaper you could mix the redbox
with real money. If operators are listening the difference in tones are
chopped up to the verying degree of quality of the phones.

I will say though that in high risk areas it is much harder and harder to
find them, specifically university areas.  Morewood's phones used to work a
long time ago but ive seen them work on those phones since then so I dunno.
 I personally havnt used them. Boon dock areas (out west, down south,
bumble fuck towns) are high probabilty places.  Its still possible to play
with the switching there as well (or so i hear) but more and more phones
are moving to outof band switching at a faster and faster rate.

Unfortately all the good phreaking is done over seas these days. 

Hehe, and to bring the content back on topic. Raves are good places to play
with stuff like this.  Large amounts of people makes it hard for police to
showup and 'nail' someone.  Especially if they dont have 'proof'; of bad
usage.  (which they cant usually from the other end except for the really
wacky shit like 2600bursts which will get you nailed in 2 shackes of cats
ass).  Plus most phones at raves are 'out there' enough from regular
university/teenage/hacker usage that the chances of them being abused are
small. Though places like centers (irish, whatever) probably are not
cocot's since they are probably courtesy phones for the patrons and cocot's

You really should denote which tones you're talking about:

If you mean standard DTMF (1-0,*,#), then they should still work as
they're used to denote the destination of the call.

If you're referring to the 5500-2200Hz tones which denote a coin being
dropped in, they should still work in Oakland, and they have been known to
work sporadically in the outlaying areas (at least every other suburb..
Richland and Wexford no, Allison Park yes, Hampton not sure (presumed
not)).

If you mean blue boxing, only if you're out where Whitley Streiber lives.

It's not so much the payphone as it is the switch that it's linked to.
COCOTs (privately-owned payphones) are right out, they use a different
method of recording coins being dropped in.  Standard payphones, it's hit
or miss these days.  The software at the switches is getting pickier and
picker about tolerences, and the newer revs of the software can pick up
recordings or synthesised tones coming through the mouthpiece more
readily.

<nod>

At best, it was a king hell dialing string.  Nothing more.

If the signal quality is too poor, they will also notice.  There is at
least one phone in Oakland and two downtown which don't even accept
quarters (oh, the irony)...

Has the penny technique been known to work?  The coin sorter in the
payphone should let them drop right through without even registering.
Remember, it's not an operator you're tricking, it's the software down at
the telco's switch.

> In general you need to find a COCOT (Company owned coin operated telephone).

Ummmmm...  no.

COCOTs use an entirely different method of recording coins put in.
Specifically, one that the microcomputer installed therin can understand.

If they're covered with stickers and/or advertisments for cheap
international rates from a company you've never heard of, it's a COCOT.

I try to avoid them as much as possible.  They filter out local
special-purpose numbers (like ringbacks and ANACs) and they practically
rape you on change.

Sometimes the newer public phones don't echo the tones so as to give the
newer folks any ideas.

Blow into it.  If you can hear your breath through the earpiece, then
that's that.

Unfortunately, COCOTs do turn off the mouthpiece for this very reason.
There was a flaw in the early 90's models where you could dial an 800, be
hung up on, and then use a white box (if you felt like building a tone
tialer) to jump off to another number.  Solution:  Deactivate the
mouthpiece.

Not sure where in Pittsburgh does this, but it was pretty common in
Rochester.

This technique works.

They've upgaraded the software for just this reason.

If you're lucky enough to be out in the middle of nowhere, you might be

of history...

IBM built OS/2.  Are you sure?

Wow..  talk about offtopic.

see blacklisted411.com .
when it's up.
boxes still work in the US.
Lots of diff. methods of doing the same idea
but I find it easiest to use personal digital recorders.
anyway,
jus my 2 cents

I saw a special on the sci-fi channel hosted by Gary Oldman, i think it'll
be sweet, i admit, i'd like the movie to be as bad as can be (as in the
special effects like they were on the original show), but what would be the
purpose?   When i heard Gary was playing doctor smith, i was like, what?
Dr. Smith is supposed to be some betraying sissy, but i'm gonna see it
anyway.

Never fear, Smith is here!!

from the annals of the 'the more things change, the more they stay the same."

this is a from a 1922 news article:

""Freda was a clever dancer, though personally I used to think her steps
of an exaggerated type,"  an acquaintance condescendly remarked. 
"Always full of energy, even at four or five in the morning she would
still be dancing and showing very few signs of fatique."  As she danced,
she chewed gum to mask the involuntary grinding of her teeth."
--from a book by marek kohn called _cocaine girls_

and this is from f. scott fiztgerald's _this side of paradise_ (1920):

amory blaine is described as living in a world of "vast juvenille
intrigue," "petting parties," and girls "deep in an atmosphere of jungle
music and the questioning of moral codes."

IBM has OS/2 and almost all financial institutions run it on almost every
machine they use with the exception of mainframes.  it has historically been
more stable, more robust, and more secure than the MS OSes.  Why they don't
use some unix flavor i'm unclear.  OS/2 was selected because of it's
superior mainframe integration which is obviously a huge concern to banks.

OS/2 was originally developed as a joint partnership venture between MS and
IBM for financial and corporate computing environments.  during the first
rewrite some deep differences emerged between the two teams about which
direction the development process should go.  The resulting split gave IBM
OS/2 and MS just enough of the rights to still make a few bucks off of every
copy that IBM sells (that's huge funny to me, microsoft even owns the
competition.  see also: macintosh).  From that basis, MS developed Windows
NT which still claims to support OS/2 applications and it does, but it only
supports OS/2 apps developed through OS/2 version ONE.  That represents
about zero percent of the useable applicatons, give or take.  Most OS/2
machines are running microsoft applications anyway.

The next revision of NT will not support OS/2 applications of any version,
but will still support POSIX.  go figure.

There are many methods for hacking ATMs, but almost none of them result in
free cash.  at best, you can reprogram the options list or see the list of
recent transactions, occasionally make a wierd noise or funky screen junk.
It would be fun to include your message on all the recipts it prints though
;)

for more info on hacking ATMs check back issues of 2.6K magazine.  It's a
great resource for clever social manipulations, pranks, tricks, phreaks, and
it's got great payphone photographs on the back cover.  I also recommend it
to any sysadmins because knowing what the enemy uses and tries serves me
well in creating a secure a defense against information attacks.  That helps
me keep my (day) job.

okay, that was off topic. and geeky (but it felt good).

what's going on in and around cleveland on april 10?  that's a friday and

Just an interesting little tidbit..I think IBM and Microsoft were 
working together on a windowing system, they split, microsoft making 
windows and IBM Os/2..I've heard rumors that a good majority of the 
Win95 code is origionaly from Os/2...can't confirm, but wouldn't be 
surprised :)

Heh, doesn't discussing geek stuff disqualify us as ravers or 
something? ;-)

One small question...........does anyone know of any message boards like this
one that deals with "program disassembling"   

I've got a few question that I would LOVE to get answered, and I was wondering
if there is a board that could help me out?  

I just need to crack TimeLOCK 3.03 and a few other things:)  

Much Thanks
Jason

I was hopeing that was obvios. I didnt plan on getting into an allout
discussion. Just refuting what the guy said.

Umm, you are trying to say that COCOTs wont or may work? I put them on the
may list. Many cocots dont even think about turning off the mouthpiece.
But more and more regular ones DO turn off the mouth piece.
But as I said i havnt actually played with this stuff in a long time, I
never have a reason to call anyone anymore.

Umm, actually it was the operator I was fooling.  Last time i heard the
software at the other end doesnt listen for the coin drop. But the
operator's usually do when they are trying to determine if you are boxing
the phone or not.  Most operators do fall for the penny trick.  (One
didnt, "haha now drop in 24more of those and ill think about it") Actually
that is another way to redbox a phone that doesnt turn the mouthpiece on
until you are ready to talk.  Ask them to complete a call for you and
punch it in then. Worst case scenario you call back in ten minutes on a
different operator.

Mabye we are talking about two different styles of COCOTs, either that or
the the COCOTs of this year are a lot different then of about two years
ago.  Originally the COCOTs were put on regular phone company payphone
lines. Just having it a COCOT let them charge more, and had them in charge
of the maintance/upkeep.  Im not talking about COCOTs that are on regular
phone lines.  Those are a whole different ball of wax (and much more fun
:)

I'm still saying not all of them do.  And of course there is still the
point that if you dump the phantom quarters in halfway through the call
the mouthpiece is going to be on.

Well the exact boot line I *THINK* was "Microsoft Operating System/2"
It went by very fast but the Microsoft and /2 stuck out.
Microsoft scared me, /2 confused me.  I thought most banks used
proprietary software on proprietary machines.

It doesnt in my book, but we already had that war. :)
I expected to get reamed six ways from sunday for replying the first time.
Ive gotten a couple "you get burned yet?" posts and not a single
flame-"get off my fucking list you geek" post.  I feel much better about
the list in general, thank you all for being very considerate.

Hey Clevelanders,

My company is looking for an executive assistant.  You should have 5 years
experience or combination 5 years education/training and experience.  You
should be proficient in Microsoft Office, good with the telephones, able to
handle multiple projects, energetic and fun.

My company is small, mostly young, cool and has a bright future IMHO.  While
we are a serious business, the stodgy office is not for us and
business/casual is the daily dress.

For more information, email me privately...

james.gill@cclr.com

I think it's more likely that it's because OS/2 1.3 was partially certified
as capable of handling up to Top-Secret government data so long as the
machine was physically secure (that means not on a conventional network). I
used to work at a RADAR tracking site with one.

Yeah IBM had pressure to support the 286 because it sold a ton of ATs and
PS/2s and promised they'd write a new OS for them... Microsoft knew the 286
was brain-damaged (no way to return to 8086 mode), and wanted to skip the
286 in favor of the 386. so when 1.3 was close to completion they parted
ways with IBM, and went on to build NT, recycling much of the OS/2 code...
that's why OS/2 1.3 console apps will run on NT...

OS/2 1.3 was stable as all hell tho... I never saw it go down once in the
year or so that I hadda use it. That's prolly why NT is so stable...

Pointless post of the day (almost).

I can't really tell whether that whole
  
"we are one" aka "we are on e" 
 thing is clever or annoying.

But I'm leaning *heavily* towards the latter.
In effect it seems to be saying:

"It looks like we ravers have unity, but in fact, 
 we're just bound together by our love for extasy"

Whether or not this is true - must it really be the next 'fashion trend'
of the rave scene?  Oi!  

Now for the -Almost- part:

	An intelligent woman once told me that "the scene" is made up of many
different things...and to critique one harsly without looking at all of the
other aspects of "the scene" is pointless.   

	If some people are going to ridicule "candy ravers" and some express their
negativity towards the junglists......While others talk badly about Sesame
Street and shoes....hacking,cracking and phreaking shouldn't be any different.

	Granted.....I'm not a member of the Phrozen Crew....But I have done my fair
share:-)  And like Big Bird, Shoes, AND DRUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!   "Technological
manipulation" is also a huge part of the rave culture.  Wether you see it or
not.....

	If could be your favorite DJ ripping off a sample from an old disco tune, or
it could be one of your favorite PA's generating serial numbers to get the
full versions of Cakewalk or Cubase:-)   

     My point is..........The beautiful thing about this scene is it's
diversity.  And thats my two cents!   Honestly I was thinking.........the next
time I do a Smart Bar somewhere, I'd like to "host" a Net-meet,   And a "Hack-
meet"   (for lack of a better term)  I think alot of the people on this list
might be interested in who know's what and how to do it:-)  

      One Love

Hi all,

Here I am, all alone in Bloomington, Indiana.  Come visit me!!  It's only
a three hour drive from Columbus and a seven hour drive from Pittsburgh.
You can do it!  The reason I request:

Oh my gosh!  This rave is for a good cause!!!  WSA (Women's Student
Association) and OUT (IU's Gay, Lesbian, Bi group) developed this project.
They received a grant with the proposal that the procedes would benefit
various charities.

Straight from the flyer:

Calling all ravers...Calling all ravers...raver needs help:

Hello,

I go to Indiana University and recently I was asked to be a part of a
sociology presentation about subcultures.  Included in this term are goth,
industrial, mod, sXe, and ravers.  Hi, I'm a raver...and you are......?

Anyway, you can debate all you want as to whether or not raving has
achieved subculture status, but my plea remains.  I'd really like some
suggestions on how to present raving.  I may be in a little over my head.

Thank you very much,
Jenifer Foulmood

What's up everybody?

I wanted to let everyone know that I will be playing on Geoff's radio
show on saturday sometime between the times of 2-4.  I'll be using me and
frankie-g's collective records (frankie-g can't make it) and be playing
almost mainly jump-up with some various other shit in the mix.  It is on
WPTS . . . I don't even know the call number.  Oh well, if you're going
to listen you know what station it is.

ABSOLUT

Will NOT.  COCOTs don't use the same mechanism that standard payphones
use.

Oh, yes they do.  Input to the mouthpiece never reaches the phone line
directly.  Tones cannot be entered via dialer, only the keypad.  And those
digits are buffered and checked against the database of the microcomputer
controlling the phone.

To discourage phreaking.

Thanks for the clarification.

Even though you just threw in a penny, it will come up on their console as
a fake when you hit the quarter tones.

Heh.  Operators with a sense of humour.

Point taken.

Perhaps.  I'm most familiar with the "bulletproof" sylte of COCOT from the
early to mid 90's, which are still in widespread use.

That's the way they work.  Different lines would mean a different telco.

Same phone line, different bill to be paid.

None of them do.

Are you still talking abotu COCOTs?  Assumption:  you are.

COCOTs do NOT use tones to denote change.  Ordinary payphones generate
tones which the switch then interprets.  COCOTs use a slightly different
mechanism which is interfaced with a computer in the COCOT itself.  You'd
have to crack the phone and fiddle with the computer itself.

AFAIK.

Wed Apr 08                   LOWEST OF THE LOW                   Pittsburgh

[sounds interesting, but somewhat off-topic???]

Invisible Reoords is pleased to announce the "Lowest of the Low" 1998
North American tour
featuring 5 main bands complimented by special guests at various points
in the tour.

"Not Breathing" will open the evening with its blend of hard techno and
experimental noise.

"Bagman" is the side project of Lee "Bastard" Fraser of Sheep on Drugs.
Lee remains one of the most prominent artists working in the field of
jungle and electronic music.

"F.M. Einheit" of Einsturzende Neubauten will make a rare North America
appearance with his 4 piece band.  Industrial madness.

"Scorn" - Dub terrorist Mick Harris' group Scorn has recieved critical
support and has established a wide audience for his pioneering ambient
dub.

"Pigface"  - if your familiar with the old; this is ALOT different,
ambient and danceable with some of the old thrown in too.  In addition
to the usual suspects including Martin Atkins, Charles Levi (My Life
with the TKK), Bob Dog, Curse Mackey (Evil Mothers) and Meg Lee Chin,
three other performers have been confirmed:  Gus Ferguson (Test Dept and
Dead Can Dance), Vas Kallas (Hanzel und Gretyl) and Jared Hendrickson
(Chemlab).  Additional contributors TBA.

    The evening will be seamless...with respect to your time, money,
ears and eyes; this event will be coming to you complete with an ultra
low end sound system and state of the art visual manipulations (Genesis
P. Orridge) to stimulate and already overstimulated audience. This is
not to be missed.

Wednesday April 8th, 1998  Metropol
advance tickets $12.50

Wed Apr 08                   LOWEST OF THE LOW                   Pittsburgh

[sounds interesting, but somewhat off-topic???]

Invisible Reoords is pleased to announce the "Lowest of the Low" 1998
North American tour
featuring 5 main bands complimented by special guests at various points
in the tour.

"Not Breathing" will open the evening with its blend of hard techno and
experimental noise.

"Bagman" is the side project of Lee "Bastard" Fraser of Sheep on Drugs.
Lee remains one of the most prominent artists working in the field of
jungle and electronic music.

"F.M. Einheit" of Einsturzende Neubauten will make a rare North America
appearance with his 4 piece band.  Industrial madness.

"Scorn" - Dub terrorist Mick Harris' group Scorn has recieved critical
support and has established a wide audience for his pioneering ambient
dub.

"Pigface"  - if your familiar with the old; this is ALOT different,
ambient and danceable with some of the old thrown in too.  In addition
to the usual suspects including Martin Atkins, Charles Levi (My Life
with the TKK), Bob Dog, Curse Mackey (Evil Mothers) and Meg Lee Chin,
three other performers have been confirmed:  Gus Ferguson (Test Dept and
Dead Can Dance), Vas Kallas (Hanzel und Gretyl) and Jared Hendrickson
(Chemlab).  Additional contributors TBA.

    The evening will be seamless...with respect to your time, money,
ears and eyes; this event will be coming to you complete with an ultra
low end sound system and state of the art visual manipulations (Genesis
P. Orridge) to stimulate and already overstimulated audience. This is
not to be missed.

Wednesday April 8th, 1998  Metropol
advance tickets $12.50

Awwlll..That's ok.  The R0M is a privelege, not a right!  Just as riding a
yellow bus to school every morning is? Thanks for providing info.  yeeeaahh,
27 and BOOTAY battle are very close together!  what a great way to close out
the pps career.  in fact, over 5 brashearians may come -- great job guys!*

I'm sorry.  I have to rant or maybe be just a little shocked.  Forgive me
Mtv haters of the list, I've been watching Music Television.  

I was watching some little man do an interview with the new woman from
Lost in Space.  It cut to the man in New York and he put on a Crystal
Method video of Busy Child (which btw, I think I like it).  The video was
pretty neato, as are some other videos that have been popping up out of
our misty rave culture.  When it came back to the program, there was a
-----DJ----- spinning a JUNGLE track!!!!!  The other little host man was
talking about RAVES!!!!  He was saying "that's a kind of trancey track,
right".  (Of course, he was wrong!!!!).  Oh BooHoo.  I knew that we were
probably heading for this, but now that I see it with my own baby blues,
they're just welling up!!!!  Oh dear, does anyone else want their clothing
back before someone sees us in our underwears?

That's a really weird thing Jen.  Its hard to believe someone academic

It's not actually the academic that organized it.  At IU, we have a
program called CUE: CommUnity Educators.  There's a CUE in each dorm.  The
CUE at Read Center has experienced an appalling amount of abuse at the
hands of her floor and suite mates (she identifies as a "goth").  Many of
her friends are branches of that "subculture".  She decided to do an
educational program and started the ball rolling with the CUE people.  I
thinks it's almost more like some people are tired of being stereotyped.

I don't know if I want to do that.  I have this weird policy about being
honest.  

Thanks anyways,

Yo tom - here's my proposed post to tha list...tell me what you think.
Maybe i'm thinking about this too much.
Anyway - we'v got to deciede stuff REAL soon.  Let me know about G&K ASAP.
Did you try the Neville Ice Rink?  Once we deceide on a date/place we can
confirm all the djs, and see how much fundage we need upfront. K?

Groovy Gravy.
- geoff

--------
Allrite kiddies...time for my daily big post to the list...

THE END OF THE BEGINNING IS NEAR.
Go into your house for three days.  If you are not taken, than be glad.
That's what the Duncan Donuts lady used to say - and now its coming due.

The rave scene has been putting along like Herbie the love bug for some
years now - maybe it knows where its going, maybe it doesn't, but we know
its good at the core...don't we?  Don't we?  I haven't been so sure for a
while. I like the individuals out there, and the music for the most part, 
and what i can tell is locked in the deep reaches ov every ravers mind is 
a little tricky, brilliant box of goodness. But its the *environment*
that's been degrading the most.  (Not failing to give props to promoters
like House of Styles & Steel City - who are the main reasons i still go to
events)   What are we afraid of?  Being ourselves?  Showing each other
that we're not 100% coolkids through and through?  That we might, eek, be
individuals?  That we can get together and dance, groove, interact without
the clics that divide our  'progressive' society?  That we might actually
enjoy being goofy!?  Its debatable whether raves ever like this - maybe
people at large aren't ready.  

But that's irrelivant.

We'v got to give it a shot.

So its time to fuck things up!

If you don't know by now, I'm trying to put together a medium size event
this summer (hopefully first in the series) together with a collective of
folks and other technology pirates, with the intent to infuse the scene
with some energy and renegade spirit!  Or at the very least, we want to
throw a inexpensive, unique event and have good time. I want people to get
hyped - because we intend to blow off your skullcaps and dip your brain in
hersheys chocolate shell! But, i need your folks help.  If you do an
original pa, or spin a unique style, or even a traditional rave style with
some energy - I want you there. We'll be having two rooms, with one main
room featureing the main lineup, the second room being the "Free-4-All"
Galley - encouraging experimentation, collaboration, sets from new
djs/acts or non-ravelike acts.  If you do something unique or cool - make
abstract home sci-fi films, juggle torches, large artwork or jewelry, gaff
tshirts, etc.. - I'd like to talk to you.  We want to hit folks from all
sensory angles.  

Much more is in store on this one - and of course this list will be kept
up as things develop.  I wanna see all you'r smilin' painted faces at this
thing! :)

This Century has been far too much about fear - lets end it now.

- thee 3rd Annual Doctor Cutup

Forget it Jennifer. Rave culture is now the "alternative" of the late 90's.
A large group  of multi-media executives all gathered about a year ago to
make this happen. (if you believe in conspiracy theories ;-) The genie is
already out of the bottle. I figured I'd take this time to tell the list
that I did an interview iwith MTV in Miami at the AMP house for future
airing. I am not sure when it will air but I have been informed that it
will air several times. It's pretty short. They asked me "if living in
Pittsburgh influenced my dark sound." To which I responded, "Absolutely,
Pittsburgh can be a very dark place."  The interviewer was one of the
producers of Amp and he was pretty cool. I didn't even realize the
interview was underway until I saw the red light on the camera. It was very
conversational. I signed a release last week allowing its use and it is a
bit spooky knowing I'm now a "public figure". What is even more scary is
that I'm about to take a huge step in my life in general that will no doubt
be affect my live PA's. It will be controversial and that means, you
guessed it, MTV and music mags like URB, Mixmag and Rolling Stone are going
to want to talk about it. I'll tell you all more about this huge step in a
few weeks or so right before I issue a press release to all promoters,
music media, and the internet.  Believe me, the pb-cle family will be the
first to know about all this and I hope I continue to have your support.

Other than that, some things of note.

One of my tracks (The Return of Shaft) on the "Rock & Roll" aka "This is
Jungle Sky Vol 5" compilation, is reviewed in the April or May (not sure
which) issue of Rolling Stone.

The new album, "Quality Rolls" will be coming out later than expected due
to the release of the above compilation. It will now most likely come out
in June or July or possibly even next fall. That's ok because I have gone
back to work on it to make it even better than it would have been!

Oh yeah, and if you haven't already seen it, I made the cover of URB this
month as part of their "Next 100" feature. (Too bad the photo on the cover
is now obsolete - I cut off my dreds).


Take care and have a peaceful and fun weekend,

Forget it Jennifer. Rave culture is now the "alternative" of the late 90's.
A large group  of multi-media executives all gathered about a year ago to
make this happen. (if you believe in conspiracy theories ;-) The genie is
already out of the bottle. I figured I'd take this time to tell the list
that I did an interview iwith MTV in Miami at the AMP house for future
airing. I am not sure when it will air but I have been informed that it
will air several times. It's pretty short. They asked me "if living in
Pittsburgh influenced my dark sound." To which I responded, "Absolutely,
Pittsburgh can be a very dark place."  The interviewer was one of the
producers of Amp and he was pretty cool. I didn't even realize the
interview was underway until I saw the red light on the camera. It was very
conversational. I signed a release last week allowing its use and it is a
bit spooky knowing I'm now a "public figure". What is even more scary is
that I'm about to take a huge step in my life in general that will no doubt
be affect my live PA's. It will be controversial and that means, you
guessed it, MTV and music mags like URB, Mixmag and Rolling Stone are going
to want to talk about it. I'll tell you all more about this huge step in a
few weeks or so right before I issue a press release to all promoters,
music media, and the internet.  Believe me, the pb-cle family will be the
first to know about all this and I hope I continue to have your support.

Other than that, some things of note.

One of my tracks (The Return of Shaft) on the "Rock & Roll" aka "This is
Jungle Sky Vol 5" compilation, is reviewed in the April or May (not sure
which) issue of Rolling Stone.

The new album, "Quality Rolls" will be coming out later than expected due
to the release of the above compilation. It will now most likely come out
in June or July or possibly even next fall. That's ok because I have gone
back to work on it to make it even better than it would have been!

Oh yeah, and if you haven't already seen it, I made the cover of URB this
month as part of their "Next 100" feature. (Too bad the photo on the cover
is now obsolete - I cut off my dreds).


Take care and have a peaceful and fun weekend,

[Lots of lame shit cut out]

gee, nice re-posting of some lame text file that has been around for
years. what else to expect from an AOL kiddie, eh?

there are plenty of newsgroups out there to have your "hacking/phreaking"
discussions (please note i used that term lightly when dealing with the
recent traffic on this list). last i checked this was
'Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves'. so take it alt.2600 or something more suited
for this shite.

Well everyone, I was watching Amp to see if the long-awaited, amazing new
1.8.7 video would FINALLY be on tonight.  The new video was not on, but
the long-awaited interview of 1.8.7 was!!!!!  Unfortunately, it was very
short, too short for my likeings, but then again, I could listen to him
talk for hours (those were the days)!!  Although I was very disappointed
that the new video was not on, I supposed I was satisfied that at least
the first one was on, even if they did cut it short.  I have this show on
tape, too, if anyone is interested.

I would also like to publicly apologize for being so into Mtv...I blame it
on society....."That's bullshit.  You're a white suburban punk, just like
me" "But it still hurts"...(gurgle)

Name that quote!!!

Just thought i'd drop a lil' info to the list...

Remember former Pb-Cle'rs Farmer Tea and Grrl 13 (Amy)?
Well, they'v got their own domestic drum & bass label now, based out of
South Beach FL - and their first single is out in shops now.

I took a listen @ hypervinyl the other day and its wicked!  No jokin -
both have some really thick and original production!  Check out 'Cerulean'
if you like the Shadowboxin' style business - just not so minimal!  The
flip is also quite ill, building and building on some minimal breaks up to
a nice amen rhumba.

In case you wanna check it out its:
BOOSTED 001  Aria Trece "Cerulean"/Send Breaks "The Chase"

they also have a website: www.boosted.com

bigup!

Emilio Estevez in REPO MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is
a classic 80's movie, i strongly recomend it! FUCKIN' JOHN WAYNE!!!

Anyway as for the ever so popular mud tv, my friend and i saw the same
"interview" the mtv dude said so is the trance? DJ said no. The next
question was is this Rave music? [dumb ass]. The dj said it was more drum
and bass so the dude asked if he was the only one who did d&b! 
BWHAAAAAA!!! we got a good chuckle. The mtv dude, trying to regain some
dignity i guess, commented that the music was hip-hop dance style with rap
lyrics over it. Oh well, can't really blame the dude for being an
uncultured fuck, he does work for mtv after all. 

trying to live liff that's completely free

    Woah, gotta get this one.  Toby and Amy were a super nice couple. 
Through some friends I heard the were doing well in Miami (Love that
city).  I guess things are taking off now.

    Has anyone heard the new Sleepy C, Dave Trace 12".  I hadn't heard
any of their tracks before...but I was impressed.  Very cool funky
breaks.  Was broke when I saw it so I didn't buy it...next time though.
    I love when people in the Penn/Ohio area release stuff.

haven't seen it mentioned here but columbus has had a few releases lately
to add.  titonton's got a solo ep on a new columbus label called residual. 
the ep's entitled "arousal" and it contains some great experimental techno
with melodic elements.  meanwhile, the 21/22 corporation just put our
"trace elements 3" out into the world.  4 diverse melodic-style techno
pieces, including one track each from dan curtin, dego (as nu-era),
titonton & morgan, and dac crowell.

any feedback on either of these would be greatly appreciated.  the
columbus cru is eager to hear how these things are being received.

You know I could just as easily say "thanks for making my case on why
people named Randy are complete generalizing morons.  you've been very
helpful...now go be condescending to people based on their email
addresses."

BUT, I don't mean that.  Its rediculous to assume that all people named
Randy make big generalizations.  In fact you probably are a cool guy but
felt some need to respond negetively to the addmittedly stupid post the
guy made.  The point I'm trying to make is that its easy to make
generalizations based on people's appearances weather it is clothes, skin
color, email address, or whatever.  I think we should try to avoid falling
into this pattern of behavior.  Indeed there are plenty of stupid people
on aol as with any large service provider but there are a good number of
smart people on aol as well.  Just the same way, I'm sure there are lots
of smart people with email addresses @mit.edu as well as some real idiots.  

Please excuse me for being all woo-woo PC enforcer today, but I think this
is an important issue.  I will be quite honest about the fact that I have
and sometimes still make generalizations based on appearances but I try to
catch myself and question it when I do.

-Brendan

PS - Hope to see a bunch of you in Space!  We have a vanload coming from
CMU.

Hehe :) I understand where you're coming from... however there's some
historical basis for assuming AOLers to be somewhat lacking in net savvy...
The case isn't really as much as it used to since AOL has gone unlimited
INET access... but say a few years ago, anyone who was using AOL to access
the Inernet was getting ripped off... this didnt mean they were stupid, just
ignorant of the Internet, and / or computers... About the time an AOLer
figgured out that they didnt have to pay $200/month to play on the internet,
that they could in fact buy unlimited access from a local ISP for $20 per
month, was about the time they started to learn some net manners, customs
etc... So you ended up getting ALOT of annoying posts from AOLers on the
news groups, IRC, etc... Never really happened too much on mailing lists,
cause they're a little more difficult to figure out :)

The typical case was the average "Christmas User" who's mom and dad bought
them a computer for christmas and it had one of those America Online disks
free with it. so they log on to the I-Net and think they are the dude from
"War Games" all of a sudden, talking like they are 'leet and gonna hack you
and nuke you etc... I've seen it for over 10 years over and over and over...
Used to happen on C-Serve, BBSs etc... now it seems the common dumping
ground is AOL, simply because they appeal to the average brain-dead american
family (i.e. They advertise ALOT on TV, and they give you the disk for FREE!
:0)

Nowadays, the point can still be made someone mildly, cause AOL's data rates
bite ass, the lag is high, ping is high, dropped packets are high, and the
likelyhood of getting a busy signal from them is High... where as my
friendly ISP is $25/month, and has none of those problems, and is
triple-homed, so basically 3 backbones have to go down before I experience
outages...

Of course, like any generalization, this one has exceptions... like people
who had thier E-Mail address so widely distributed when they were a
net-newbie that now they are pretty much stuck logging on to AOL for email
purposes at least... There's really no where in the US that AOL is the only
choice so that's no excuse :) (there's AT&T worldnet all over, and
Bell-Atlantic all over the east etc)

my 2c worth
Dan

i just have a quick question....recently i joined the pb-cle rave list in 
order to post parties to my site from western pa....which i do consider 
part of the northeast...but i've noticed that on the list there are A LOT 
of events taking place in cleveland or columbus, ohio.
my question: would you folks that actually use my site (calendar for the 
northeast) like to see events in ohio listed? is this really the 
northeast?. i'd like as much input on this as possible, anyone from any of 
the northeast lists...i know i would go to a party in cleveland if i 
thought it was gonna be sick...but i don't want to waste my time posting 
parties no one would ever think about going to...this calendar takes up too 
much of my time as it is....

please give me some kind of response to this (in my email, not the various 
lists)....thanks!

-john

ps: i'm taking most of the graphics off of my site today because i'm 
finally admitting that the calendar should be more functional than 
pretty...it should be  a lot faster to load no :)

> subculture???????? What is this word supposed to mean i never understood.To me
> it just what people that try to hard to be different label themselves.Hey I'm

Don't you see?  That's EXACTLY what a subculture is!  It's a scene that a
lot of (usually) individual people seem to pool, just because they have
similar interests.  We're a subculture because we all like to go to
parties, for one reason or another.  We all like electronic music, in one
form or another.  Many or most of us hold similar philosophies that deal
with "peace, love, unity, respect", although I can find a few exceptions 
on the screen in front of my face.  Subculture isn't a whole bunch of
clones running around trying to be EXACTLY like each other.  Subculture is
a bunch of people who feel ostracized by the general mainstream public.
They find solace in people with like attitudes.   

> ME MYSELF AND I I don't try to be my own weirdo self and start my own

On the contrary, I think you're trying too HARD.  Besides, I don't think
you can have you're own culture unless people want to follow your beliefs
and if this list is any indication of the general populus' view...well,
you do the math.

> Somehow I always end up in these "subculture scenes" but to me thats

Well, you could always just leave this "subculture [scene]".

> being YOURSELF

Yet again, you totally miss the point.  Most people don't go to (two
words) raves because they want to be in a subculture.  They're a part of a
subculture because they go to raves.  Duh.  If you looked at it even
closer, you might see that any one person could be in any number of
"subcultures" if they so chose because of the number of interests and
beliefs they identify with.  Honestly, I think that anyone that identifies
with only one group is pretty uninteresting.  Diversity is the key to the
future, as cliche as that may sound, and I do hate cliches.

P.S. to all who were in columbus at maxwells....i had a great time playing for
everybody down there....what a dope ass scene.....it was refreshing to get a

Whassup kids!!!  just wanted to say that it was great coming back to cleveland
for SPACE.  As usual the vibe was intense, open, loving, and everything else
good and open.  i was rolling really hard so it was a lot of fun just watching
the party and the crazy kiddies running around-a lot of the party was spent
pacifier in mouth and eyes wide open because everything was just so
interesting.  The music was intense and i loved it!  
much love,
  sharon

*prenote all quoted names are generalizations used only for the lack of
better communication. They were all based on the socially defined LOOKS of
people.  Though I talked to a bunch.  

Cleveland last night taught me something that I had not seen before.
Something that I had simply not thought possible in todays society.  There
really are places/times where large number's of people can get together and
throw their prejudeces out the window.  Around here, in the general
populace anyway, you would rarely see a 'punk' be perfectly at home at a
rave glowstickin out like notomorrow.  See a crowd filled with the biggest
diversity of styles of dress that I have ever seen and EVERYONE having fun.
 Most pittsburgh parties that I have seen where a 'clubcouple' come in
(he's macho, she's short skirt sellin booty) the vibe changes immensely.
The most gorgeos thing I saw was the 'clubcouple' that had fun and no one
cared.  I watch people and their reactions, I saw only a few 'youngins' :)
give them dirty looks, and ill admit that I gave them a dirty look at
first, but I gave them a second thought because the vibe of the place was
so insanely great.  He was dancin his ass off to the last dj, havin a mad
fun time. You would expect her to get all pissy and keep getting him to try
to leave, and I think she did for a while. But she gave up and just started
dancing. Admitedly she looked like she was 'clubdancing' but no one cared
about that either. That is what she knew, but she started to have fun.
This was the first time that a 'clubcouple' at a rave made me happy, and
that was when I realized that this party was what I think raving should be
about.  

Raving has a chance to bring back the love/peace of the seventies.  But mix
it with the technology of the nineties.  Ive got a couple true 60s hippie
friends.  But they dont take technology or any of its uses as an attack on
their beliefs.  They envy it, they embrace it, they are in awe of the power
and occasionly try to convince of the numerous ways I could make the world
a 'better place' through it.  

Society has changed, there are things we cant avoid.  Waste production has
gone up, work/stress has gone up.  But the ability to love has not changed,
just become a bit more hidden from view.  I believe we have the ability to
create in our day and age the CyberHippie.  In love with human kind,
allowing the ability for each of us to love as we wish. If we love
computers, love computers, if we love nature love nature, if we love each
other love each other.  

Commercialism, is unfortunately (in my opinion) part of society that we
cannot defeat.  We cannot defeat it by force, we can only defeat it by
cunning, and carefull planning, but with that extra umpf that doesnt
require cunning orcarefull planning, that umpf called 'love/joy/pleasure'.  

We have the ability to expand our minds and move into the commercialism.
Embrace it, learn it, understand it and CHANGE it.  Someone pointed out in
the car on the way back that the ability to break any law is proportional
to the speed at which you break it.  The slower you go the better your
success to break it safely.  Well, that is what we will need to do to break
the laws governing commericialism.  The parts that we as a collective most
probably disagree with. We dont need a manifesto, we dont even need to
define which of those laws we do not want.  But as collective if we take
the time to trust our innate human abilities to 'do the right thing' then
we will be able to change society as we see fit, slowly.  

Boy am I rambling, this is the best dayafter ive had in a long time.

"Take a little trip, do a little thought, change a little life"
Wow, man, groovy. :)

Invisible Reoords is pleased to announce the "Lowest of the Low" 1998
North American tour
featuring 5 main bands complimented by special guests at various points
in the tour.

"Not Breathing" will open the evening with its blend of hard techno and
experimental noise.

"Bagman" is the side project of Lee "Bastard" Fraser of Sheep on Drugs.
Lee remains one of the most prominent artists working in the field of
jungle and electronic music.

"F.M. Einheit" of Einsturzende Neubauten will make a rare North America
appearance with his 4 piece band.  Industrial madness.

"Scorn" - Dub terrorist Mick Harris' group Scorn has recieved critical
support and has established a wide audience for his pioneering ambient
dub.

"Pigface"  - if your familiar with the old; this is ALOT different,
ambient and danceable with some of the old thrown in too.  In addition
to the usual suspects including Martin Atkins, Charles Levi (My Life
with the TKK), Bob Dog, Curse Mackey (Evil Mothers) and Meg Lee Chin,
three other performers have been confirmed:  Gus Ferguson (Test Dept and
Dead Can Dance), Vas Kallas (Hanzel und Gretyl) and Jared Hendrickson
(Chemlab).  Additional contributors TBA.

    The evening will be seamless...with respect to your time, money,
ears and eyes; this event will be coming to you complete with an ultra
low end sound system and state of the art visual manipulations (Genesis
P. Orridge) to stimulate and already overstimulated audience. This is
not to be missed.  

Wednesday April 8th, 1998  Metropol
advance tickets $12.50

this was an interesting post that might have at first seemed like blather,
so i pasted it again for those of you who deleted it ...

well you know, a lot of ppl who subscribe to this list claim that
commercialism is a really bad thing.  and i guess that's natural as a
defense for your sense of independence - like if you like something, you
wanna be able to say you're into it because you like it and not because
someone told you to like it - whether it's through something you bothered
to look into, something you noticed other people you respect are also
into, or something you came across on mtv or waiting for a subway.

but come on ... everyone who subscribes to this list is subjected to
media, and you all make decisions about what you like and what images
appeals to you, whether you want to admit it or not.  there's nothing
wrong with that.  

so all i'm saying is that i don't think it's a so bad to watch mtv or read
vogue.  it doesn't mean you're going to sell out.  and it doesn't mean
that everyone who is on mtv or in vogue magazine is selling out, either.
roni size, jamiroquai, tommy hilfiger, and jennifer aniston just want you
to know they're there.  respect your intelligence enough to say "hey i can
accept pop culture as a medium of relaying images to me, but ultimately i
decide what i'm gonna wear, who i want to meet, what i want to do, what
i'm gonna listen to ... i admit that there are other things going on in
this world that i don't know about."

i adore dkny

rumor and I don't know if there's a shred of truth in it, so call hypervinyl

Space,

    There was some awesome music there, the DJs were up in the right order
and everything was flowing smoothly music-wise, and I liked the space, and
there were alot of women there :) and the parking was cool. That's about all
I liked about that party.

    I ran into SO many assholes there. I didn't have a good time at all... I
thought the vibe really sucked. I see what the people mean now when they say
the scene is going to hell... they must be from Cleveland or go to partys
there alot... alot of NON-PLUR people were there... Right after I walked in,
I was walking across the floor and this dude was walking towards me with
this evil look on his face... then when he got close to me, he like jumped
up in the air and came down on my shin... then he started laughing... It
hurt like a motherfucker, and I was like REALLY pissed... had it not been at
a rave I woulda beat the crap out of him... I was just like "Do I know you?"
and he said no... so I just tried to blow it off and walked away... then
later I was  sitting next to a post on the dance floor, felt some water
splash on me, looked up to see this dude throwing water on Pope Trout
himself... I was like "what the fuck"... (Did you know that dude Trout?)
Then like not 10 minutes later some asshole who'd been dancing next to me
for like an hour decided to jump up in the air and came down on me, one foot
in my crotch and the other on my friend's cup of coke, blasting me from head
to toe with coke... then he ran off, not even an apology or anything...
wierd... Then finally I was like to my friend ova "lets get away from these
assholes and go chill next to the wall"... so we were laying down just
rolling on E... had our stuff in a little pile... I got up to go to the
bathroom, came back and our stuff was gone, and my friend said these dudes
came over and were kicking him in the stomach, he woke up and was like "what
the fuck are you kicking me in the stomach for?" they tried to say they lost
a bowl there... total BS... then they left... after I got back I realized
they had took our stuff... What the fuck is that? bleah... My second
Cleveland rave, my second bad experience... I dont think I'll be going to
cleveland for any partys any time soon.

    Just wanted to say also I met like 5 or 6 really cool ravers there :) I
can't say it made up for the 5 assholes tho...

Dan

I wasnt trying to bash commercialism as a whole. But select parts of it.
Thats why I didnt specific what parts I dont enjoy. The parts that you dont
enjoy are for you to decide.  Me personally, I dont like the way that
commericalism/mass media tries to manipulate the minds of people
underhandly.  Some advertising campaigns do this excessively, but some do
it the way that I think is 'right'. Explaining the good parts, letting you
know whats available and why their product is the best. Which makes sense.
What I dont agree with is the stuff like the new camel add campaign.  

Camel called the shot thats going to sell a shitload of cigarettes to new
people without them even realizing why is that they are buying them.
Plasmatic designs are going to sell alot of things now and in the future
because of the way acid works.  When you trip and you see nice colors and
you get a good feeling the next time you see nice colors you are going to
get good feelings. So now when you see camel adds you are going to get good
feelings.  Shit im a smoker, an addict, and no longer proud of it.  But
when I see a psychadelic camel add I get a smile on my face because the add
is pleasing to the eye, but unconsciosly the mind is making a link between
camels and pleasure.  There are a lot of people out there that do not
realize this and dont even notice that they are choosing one brand over
another based on the advertising.  Classic example is the long iles of
'generic' stuff at grocerystores.  Many brandname products have *exact*
generic counterparts, many times put out by the same company, the only
difference is the advertising that was involved.  Laundry detergent and
perfumes are the text book examples.  

Its nice to know that there are people in the powerfull positions that
understand whats going on, but its upsetting that they are using to promote
something that is completely unrelated to it.  

Of course you could then argue that we are going to have to change the
world underhandedly as well.  Ahh the joy of hypocracy. :)

Almost two days later and still happy as fuck, that party was the bomb. :)

Umm "hey I can accept pop culture as a medium of relaying images to me, ..."
I do, I did, i have.  That was nowhere near what I was getting at.  I watch
mtv, i love vh1, I read all sorts of pop magazines.  I was trying to
emphasize that there is a lot that goes on inside your mind that you cant
control. As much as anyone would like to say I decide what im giong to
buy/wear/etc you never have full control over it, thats a part of life.
Advertising affects you unconsciosly, thats the whole point of a good (form
their perspective) advertising campaingn. I havnt worked in advertising
personally but I have a friend who is extremely into it, and the first
thing she was taught at her job was that the less they see the advertising
and the more they see the product the better.  To me that is underhanded. 

Getting back to my pyschadelic examples, frutopia was the first such
campaign that I can remember doing this.  Now, personally I love the taste
of some of the versions of frutopia. But evertime I see that vending
machine I think of the commercial and I think of the time I was tripping
when I saw it and how happy I became.  As I happen to like frutopia I like
that idea because I get some mental enjoyment out of drinking it as well as
the taste enjoyment. But it makes you wonder how much of that taste
enjoyment is actually from the taste and how much of it is from the mood
that it brings upon me and the memories.  And I know this happens to other
people because I have discussed it on several occasions in the past.

Looky here little man: the last time we had a SUCCESSFUL net meet in
Pittsburgh it took place at the smart bar.  When I say successful, I mean
15 people.  From what I understand, net meets aren't usually THAT
successful!  The smart bar was also being run by someone on the list,
therefore making it possible for him to attend and make a record of who
actually showed!  I bet if you asked those 15 people, myself included,
most of them would say they were happy with the experience.  What's wrong
with having a net meet at a smart bar?

This is going to be somewhat lenghty, so if you don't feel like reading it,
just delete it....

>From the posts I have read and from the hundreds of people i talked to, it
seems that almost everyone at space last saturday, which was by the way, my
party, had fun.  I also noticed the diversity of types of people that were all
getting along dancing or socializing or just generally having a good time
without thinking about normal stereotypes.  The music, in my opinion, was
better than I have heard at a party for I don't know how long, and I also got
this reaction from lots of people I talked to.   The lineup, although somewhat
close to the scheduled timeslots, got shifted too much due to several
reasons..
1. the skatery cut an hour from our lineup, the day of the party, due to
daylight savings time, this is why adam x only got to spin 1 hour, and lauren
isaac (curtis) didn't get to play live at all (who also by the way, along with
2 other people (marty and john), threw the party with me)
2. the fucking marriot hotel (at the airport) REFUSED to give us the room
numbers or even connect us to the rooms of half of our dj's, despite the fact
that we were the ones that booked their rooms.  this caused adam x to arrive
late, and got to spin for even less time.  
3. juan atkins, who drove down to cleveland with his wife and kids, blew out a
tire 30 miles west of cleveland, and didn't have the proper jacks/tools to fix
it.  this is the reason that i missed the net meet, because i frantically
drove out there in order to get him to the party to spin.

well, if this wasn't enough, on the way home from changes juan's tire and
driving him to the hotel, i get a call from john saying that we had over 950
people clicked in as paying 20 dollars, but somehow, i have NO fucking idea
how, we were about $7000 short of breaking even.  so we were all really bummed
out for the most part, seeing as how we only need about 875 people to break.
this will seemingly impossible incident may very well cause both of our summer
parties to get cancelled altogether, or moved back into the fall, because this
7000 was ALL of our own money that we now have to work for and get back.

well, that was all of the bad stuff that happened, so now, on to the good
stuff =)

11:30 i finally got to start my live set, after being delayed for about half
an hour due to the rollerskating session that had to go until 11.  i had lots
of fun playing, obviously =)

12:15 or so, the atomic babies played a fucking GREAT live set, and they
played an extended set since adam didn't get to the party until about 1:30

1:30 adam x whips out a real hard set of techno, half of which i missed cuz i
was fixing juan's tire =).. btw, that is why i wasn't at the net meet

2:30? mike dearborn - i didn't get to see any of his set except for his last
20 minutes, which definitely was indicative of the rest of his, hopefully,
which i'm sure was flawless.

4:00 - juan atkins - i don't even know what to say about this set.  the man
that originated techno here definitely lived up to it.  honestly, i have never
seen a better set of music in my life.  several people from detroit and from
outside of ohio said that they haven't seen juan spin like he did for quite
some time.  at this point, i completely stopped caring that i had lost all of
my money and started enjoying myself.

6:00 baggadonuts tore it up with some EXCELLENT techno/trance.  doug is a good
friend of mine and the rest of shortarm, and he had been hanging out with us
since friday night, when he spun at a house party down in cincinnati.  poor
doug had to sit through all of the crazyness that occurs during the day of a
party and didn't complain at all =)  

6:40 the dever, who had been really psyched about coming out to the party,
played some hard yet blissful trance.. at this time, there were still about
500 people left at the party, and a good deal of them were still dancing and
keeping up to the rather hard music.

7:20 john kelley, going along with the latest fashion of hard trance early in
the morning, also played the first half of his set in that fashion, and
probably would have continued to except alot of people started actually asking
him to play breaks =)

the last 3 dj's had their times cut WAY more than i would have liked, i
apologize to them, and also to all of the people that only got to see so
little of what they can do. 
i cannot express how bad i felt about all of this, but it seemed like all of
the dj's understood.  we are possibly going to try bringing them all out again
($ allowing as well as them being up for it), for another party and give them
all the time that they deserve

well, sorry about rambling, but i thought i would let everyone know at least
SOME of the stuff that we had to go thru in order to bring this party to you
and yes, we are all still in high school =)

Sorry this is so late coming, but "the day after" was spent in a dazed (but
happy) state and I finally got a good night's sleep last night!!  I came away
from Space with a great feeling, and coming from someone who has been in this
scene for a long, long time (I won't sink to advertising myself as being as
old as I really am...hehe) that is saying a lot for what HAS become (in my
lowly opinion) a slowly sinking ship. If I could give this ship a name, it
would probably be "All The Best of Intentions" or "The Good Ship Lollipop"
because the way parties started out, that is what they were like and about
(although of course money was also always at the root of promoters' concerns).
Unfortunately, holes in this ship have been made and/or slowly formed, as
equally by shady people who have an undying hostile attitude towards life, as
well as by people who come expecting something that was never promised in the
first place (use your imagination). Fortunately though, there are still crew
on this ship with also undying hopes of staying afloat, and undaunted efforts
at helping people to have a great time (and take a new or better understanding
away with them) under "their roof" for the night. Thanks, Lou (and the rest of
you involved in Space) for a great time. The music was fun and attention-
keeping, the people were friendly and outgoing (I think there was an invisible
sign on my head that read "if you are from out of state, please talk to me!!
hehe) and there WAS an outstanding feeling of fun going on!! (oh yeah, that's
right, it's ok to say you are having a great time, to laugh, smile and say the
party is fun...this isn't gothic industrial era anymore, is it???!!!! ;-)
[Thank Goodness...]

Lots more than you've EVER heard from me,
Casey

P.S. Mad props (I can't believe I just used that phrase) to Amy (FunkyBizz)
and Steve (StevieT) for being the cool-as-hell people that they always are.
You made my time double the fun!!! And it WAS cool meeting YOU, Crazyme33

    Steve, the Thursday night hip hop Dj there wanted me to be the
resident DJ on Fridays but the manager didn't want to deal with a house
night.  In fact he didn't want to deal with anything other than live
bands.  There's so much you could do with a place like laga but the
manager has no vision.  Hopefully he changes his mind about Fridays a
good house night on Fridays would be cool...I'm not a huge fan of Soba. 
This was the end of last semester maybee he's wised up now?

the owner pulled the plug on hypersonics cause of the after party for
Cheer. there was one tag in the bathroom and there were some cigarette
burns on the carpet.  this says nothing about the people that were
there, who were very chill, and everything about the fucked up owner of
club chameleon.  if you have any doubts about his integrity, see the
totally offensive ad for the club in last weeks 'in pittsburgh.'  it
says something like "rumors, club chameleon is not a gay bar, a black
bar, an asian bar, a white bar..."  what kind of fucked up paranoia led
to this?  he should have added, not a raver bar.  

this said, i would still go to clever, which is going to be there on
april 19th, in spite of the owner, to check out terry mullan, shane and
dustin.

Well, as far as Friday nights go, it doesn't seem as if there's a lot to
do unless you're over 21.  I have my own opinions about why Laga was
stupid to discontinue the house night, but most of you have heard it
already, I'm sure.  There IS something to do on Friday nights...every
Friday night.  There's this event that's been posted on the list called
NATO, EH.  I've only been twice because I'm at school most of the time,
but it's a pretty nifty event.

It's at this cafe called Sip (it had a REALLY nice write up in the
Best/Worst issue of In Pittsburgh).  If you get there BEFORE nine, you can
get AMAZING, albeit expensive, vegetarian/vegan dinners.  At 10, the
spinning begins with everything from funk to disco-y stuff to regular old
house.  There's not a lot of space to dance, although some of us make
space, ahem.  Their coffe is also very very good.  I recommend the
chocolatte.  It's latte with a chunk of really good chocolate just melted
in the bottom by the hot coffee.  My mouth waters just thinking about it.

This is not a rave.  This is not a party.  This is something to do on a
Friday night that is not sitting at home picking at your earwax.  I
recommend this night highly.  It's located on Spahr (I think) in
Shadyside.  If you keep your eyes open ALL of the particulars will
probably be posted.  There are also little mini fliers that can be picked
up at Avalon (last time I checked) and I bet at Slacker's, too.    

You know you want to.

Ahhh,
You have just expirenced the "New Wave" of Cleveland promoters and New
promoters parties.

I have thrown about 25 parties in Cleveland from 1991 till my last in
November of last year. We have always had good events and good people. So
don't just blame Cleveland. It's all about where the promoter promotes his
show.

It seem as if the new wave of promoters in Cleveland are promoting to
totally regular headz, (which is cool in moderation, but not when 60% of
the crowd is white trash bullyish assholes)

Again, don't just slag the city because alot of good things happen here in
Cleveland.

I think the problem is people must get to know the promoters... don't just
go to a party because it says that "Dj Awsome" will be there, because if
you know the promoter sucks, or draws crappy people, even if the Dj's show
the vibe will probably suck!

Once again... research a promoter or event as much as you can before
going.This will allow you to make an educated desicion!
Or just post a question on PB-Cle raves..... I'm sure some of my fellow
Cleveland Headz will give you the straight dope on some of the Cleveland
promoters.

Peace,
Sleepy C

Yeah, I was there the last night it was open... there was like 5 people in
the place, some dude came to the door to come in, so the bouncer went over,
talked to him, then came back and sat with us, the dude didnt come inside...
and Trevor was like "Wasnt he 21 or what?" and the bouncer was like "No, he
smelled like pot so I wouldnt let him in"... heh what a moron... That's just
bout the stupidest thing I've ever heard... I'm not sure if Trevor's too sad
not to be doing that any more, after all the shit like that.

FWIW:

    The Beehive in Oakland was re-modeled, and the upstairs is now a bar
called "The Pollenator"... 21+ only... DJ Spike is spinning House there
regularly on Saturdays and Sundays from 10pm to 2am.... I was there last
night, and it really was a pretty good set... that's from a person who's
into Jungle and Break Beats...


Also, fwiw, last night that DJ A-DEE from LA who's gonna be spinning at
Zythos on saturday was there and he guested for like 1/2 hour... He's pretty
good, I guess we dont get alot of LA DJs in the burgh, cause It was almost
all new music to me :)

Do you ever have anything good to say? Were you even there? Why do you think
your the shit?
I have never once read a positive message from you. And your the king of
ravers? Well at least you act like it. Seems fucked up to me. If all of the
old school raves were a bunch of kids that act like you then I'm glad I
wasn't involved untill the scene became "shit". Parties are what you make of
them.

True :) I've heard from 5 or 6 people who've experienced the same scenario
at Cleveland parties... typical case being - they are sleeping or napping or
just laying down, and some kids come up and nudge them... if they dont wake
up the kids go through thier stuff and steal what they can.

I would think this would prompt promoters to get security... however both
parties I went to in Cleveland had NO security. These were big parties
too... G-Spot had like 1500 people or so.

If I was a cleve. promoter I'd get security, namely some off-duty cops, and
set up a sting for these bastards that are ripping off all thier customers,
giving Cleveland, and the promoter a bad name. It wouldnt be hard... have
someone go in, dance for like 20, go lay down in a dark corner for like an
hour or so... wait till the punks come up and rip em off, then bust thier
sorry asses.

Dunno... this may be far-fetched, but then again I bet cash it would work.
It's not too hard to spot them either, I thought I had saw some kids doing
the same thing earlier, and I looked around for security to say "hay keep an
eye on them 2", but their was none present.

:P  You've seen me.  I can LOOK way over 21 if I want.  Unfortunately, I
don't have the id to go with it.  Do you see the woes of the underaged
social butterfly?  Even if you just want to go hear the music and/or
dance, it's impossible!!!  Let's not get into "the drinking age is stupid"
argument/agreement thing, again.  Sorry I brought it up.

	Hey! I've heard this song mixed and remixed and different places
and I'd love to know the artist/title/label/whatevah you can give me.
Sounds like an old school hip-hop song, pretty simple beats with the
refrain "Get Retarded".  It's sampled at the begining of a Doctor Octagon
track as well, if that helps.  ANy help is GREATLY appreciated! :)

Feelin' silly cuz I think I outta know this ;)

i'm trying to make this a short review (of space). the party started kind
of late like an hour or something, same as the last one, presumably
because the stupid skate rink took forever to close. =/ but it wasn't too
big of a deal. all the music was so good like i think everyone else has
said already. lou, sorry you lost money! i thought you would have broken
even, it seemed like there were a lot of people there. and i hope you put
out some records, i'll buy a copy of every one. i had been scheduled the
night before to spin at the afterhours, but the guy who was supposed to
run it along with 1 of the DJs left at midnight to get flyers printed and
they said they'd be back in a half hour, but they never came back. so that
left the rest of us to take care of doing the afterhours party, but none
of us knew what was going on. we knew U4ia had been booked as the location
but we didn't even know if the rent had been paid. so everything was
completely insane and at about 7:00 we finally managed to get everybody
involved together and to leave the party. we got to set up at 9 and we
found out there was a $300 debt for the rent and to use the cartridges
that were there another $100 needed to be deposited. so brian (another DJ)
borrowed the $100 from a friend and we paid the rent from the admission
revenue. someone on the list posted something about the security being
mean, i don't know who you were talking about but the owner was at the top
of the stairs most of the time and there was a bartender at the bar, the
only other people working there were us, DJs and other associated people.
we couldn't do the breakfast food and juice like one of the flyers had
said because none of us had money (the guy that disappeared had taken it
all), so considering the circumstances, i think the afterhours went pretty
well. thanks to everybody who showed up. i don't have time to write
anymore.

I heard a similar thing from Trevor - he seemed like he was tired of
dealing with the night.  I did hear that sometime in the near future
Fridays at Laga are going to be like Laga's old techno-trance-breaks-house
(and even jungle i hear) night.  I was told this by that guy Josh who
works @ hypervinyl now and is affiliated with 5-star productions (he also
djs, but i don't know what his moniker is).  

Also, about that Chameleon ad - i saw it too - kind of cheesy, but it
wasn't as bad as that other post made it out to be, it said something
like:
Club Chameleon is not:
  a gay club
  a asian club
  a black club  
  a white club
... its a club for everyone.  (yeah that last line is the saver).

Of course they're pretty hypocritial with the statement, since its
obviously not a club for under 21 folks. (well maybe it is now)

l8s,
 cutup

To ravers in the Pittsburgh area:

I am hoping that somebody out there can help me locate a long lost friend
I made in the rave scene (from Pittsburgh) whom I have lost contact with
over the years, but am desperately trying to find.

Her name is Natalie, she is about 5'8'' or so, with brown or dark blonde
hair; a very good soul and kind hearted girl.  She is still living in the
Pittsburgh area, and she works part time at restaurant-type jobs.  I
believe she is still with a guy named Zone, and she used to promote
parties in the city pretty actively.  She's been in the scene for a while,
and has some close friends down in DC-Baltimore (where I'm from)...

Can anyone help me locate where she is?

Thank you,

Allen

hey kids,

i just wanted to let you kids know how much fun i had at SPACE this past
weekend... it was my 1st Cleveland party, and it certainly wont be my
last...

my friends and i got there around 12 having gotten a bit lost (it took us
like a half an hr to find rout 79 North or whatever which is where the
directions started (none of us are from pittsburgh originally, so we dont
really knowour way around) ... we also stopped at a small gas-mart or
whatever and spent like a half an hour running around in there decididing
what we wanted... choices, choices... how does one decide??

we pull into the space, and there was a long ass line, but by the time we
pilled out of the van (there were like 10 of us) the line was gone... the
search was a joke... i didnt even have to open my bag...

i liked the space a lot, parties at skating rinks are where its all at...
but it was kind of empty... i believe they could have fit like 1500 kids, (i
figure for the line-up, thats how many they were expecting)

the vibe at this party over all was a good one... a great one when one
considers what was going on.. all the kids i talked to agreed that there
were like 2 parties going on on satarday nite... all the shady asses had
kinda taken over this one corner/side of the party (by the lockers ... those
of u who were there know what i'm talking abt) ... but the real party was on
the dancefloor where there were smiles, hugs, tons of candy, and glow sticks
galore...)

the music was excellent... everyone i talked to had a different fave dj for
the evening... my 2 fave sets bellong to Mike Dearborn and John Kelly... but
everyone rocked it... when u party in pittsburgh, u often have to sit
through some not-so-good sets... but the overall concensus was that "there
was not one bad set" the whole night... which is always a good thing...

the best thing abt this party was the lack of shade... i guess my smile
scared away all the shady asses... although i have to admit, when i first
walked into the party, the cleveland kids seemed less aproachable than i am
used to.. but as the night progressed, they seemed to soften up.. and i got
to meet a bunch of them...

one disappointment was the lack of representation from pittsburgh...
cleveland is only 2 hrs away (which is kind of a treck, but if u have a car,
its not taht bad) ... although, after reading some of the reviews, i realied
that there were quite a few kids from pittsburgh after all.. (there still
should have been more though)

we did have a netmeet... at 2 am by the skate-rantal place... kids i met..
trouty, and dan kelly...everyone else from the list who i saw i eiether
drove up w\, or go to school w\.. or both...

towards the end of the party i was getting very tired ...for those of u who
care i was sober as well as sick the whole night (at one point, i was
running a fever... but this party was totally worth it...)

the atomic babies and adam x's set really took a lot out of me.. i couldnt
stop dancing and running around all happy.. there was lots of good hard
house and techno (just the way i like it) and by the time john kelly was on
(he was up last) i was way tired... but i havnt heard him spin in a long
LONG time... and he was awsome.. so i had to get up and dance some more...
what a great evening...

random memories:

one short little girl who asked me why i walk the way i do... aparently her
sister and i share the same problem... i asked her why she didnt bring her
sister allong... answer: b/c she is only 7 years old...

getting glitter blown all over myslef by various people... "close your eyes"
they all said...

seeing greta... from this list... she was running around w\ a pair of
cruches, yet she was still much faster than the rest of us... i hadnt seen
her since last april or may.. it felt great to see her... totally made my
evening...

running around feeling like an indian (er... native american) w\ a feather
in my head...

taking lots of pictures of some awsome dancers...

making sure i gave extra candy to all the hard asses i bumped into... (what
are kandyravers for, right???)

shout outs...

matt, bendan, dave, blithe (sp??), joel, dave, alex, alex's girl, and of
course donny.... in many ways, the car ride up was my fave part of the
entire evening... matt.. thanks so much for the ride... remember dude.. keep
both hands on the wheel when your doing 80....
brendan.. thanks so much for hooking me up w\ the ride... i cant even begin
to tell u what it means to me... joel...partying sober is hard,hard work...
you were a real trooper most of the night... i'm glad we both made it after
all... donny... another great evening... thank u... for hugs, smiles, candy,
making sure i found the netmeet on time, and for the note the morning
after... it means a lot...

lou... thank u so much for everything... you are one of the most down
promotors i have met in a long time... i felt really bad, b/c i got let in
for free, and i know turn-out was low... (i'll make it up to ya, i promis)
... it was really above and beyond the call of duty to comp some random kid
who u dont know... and i apreciate it... here's to many more well -excecuted
parties... u did such an amazing job... from the standpoint of the
party-goer, everything was done beautifully.. from security all the way till
the lights came on.. congrats my friend...

sean... one of the coolest kids i met in a long time at a party... thanks
for intoucing me to all those kids... i didnt mean to dis you towards the
end.. u just kinda looked preocupied and i didnt want to interupt.. next
time (and there will be one) i'll know better.... give me a call sometime...
u can tell me all abt telemarketing...

b4 i forget... thanks to everyone who offered me a ride to the party... i
took the van b/c it left from my school.. but i still apreciate all the
offers... it shows that u kids care.. which is totally amazing...

to anyone else i may have forgotten, i appologize... everyone at the party
made me feel so welcome... it was like going back in time...to a time
[not-so] long ago...  when all [ravers] were like one big happy family...
donny ran up to me at one point and started screaming ...."i love the
midwest..." over and over.. i think i;d have to agree...

until  next time kids,

galve.

why would you do that?  on top of all that you're getting raped for $10 to
see a show that ends at 2:30 and they are not friendly about their
guestlist.  and you can catch dusting every week at soba.

Hi all!

	I've just gotten back from the sociology/subculture program.  It
was an incredible success!  I tried very hard not to use the term
subculture when referring to raving; I like community much better.  The
turn-out was amazing!  There were over 100 people there!  They were all
very curious.  
	At the end, there was a question/answer period.  Somebody asked me
to dance!!!  Some of my friends were there, so we all danced because we
all have very distinct styles.  A lot of people had drug questions.  A lot
of people wanted to know how we get into raving, why we do it, if we're
running from society.  I answered as best I could.  MANY people wanted to
know how they could find out about raves.  Many had experienced snootiness
in the hands of ravers not wanting mainstreamers there, but it kind of
makes you think, what were we before we were ravers?
	I used that opportunity to promote the HELL out of our upcoming
party, Estrogen Project.  It was an over all educational experience on
just about everyone's part.  I still got a little flustered.  It's a good
thing I had my friend Lucas to help!  Anyway, I love raving and I want
other people to have the opportunity to experience raving.  It was great!

Love ya,
Jenifer Foulmood

Man...

I didnt know there was so much PLUR on this list, but I got like 8 emails
from separate people who expressed various PLUR emotions to me reguarding my
bad experience at space. People who've I've never seen email the list, or
anything. That's cool as hell really :) And yes I met some cool people there
at the party too :) I guess those 3 personal events and witnissing the 4th
just kinda made me forget about that... at the time tho I was trying to have
a good time, getting into the music, smiling like crazzy, rolling my ass off
:) etc... I say again that was one of the best all-around lineups I've
heard, my friend Ova and I both kept saying how awesome the music was. Ova
said people kept coming up to him saying how cool his hair was etc... but he
still felt bummed bout the scene... it's literally a rude awakening to get
kicked in the stomach then discover you've been looted. I guess someone
sooner or later will get those punks. Next time yer at a rave, look around
for these guys, they both had hoods on, were wearing dark clothes, solid
colors... when I saw them earlier in the evening they were pretending to
look for something they lost... I thought it was odd that they were
searching the whole damn floor.. keep an eye out for them :) And thanks to
all the cool people who offered me comfort :)

PLUR

A while back I asked people if anyone could list the clubs / coffee houses
in pittsburgh to get my daily dose of good music, and no one seemed to
know... now I've compiled a little list of places I thought I'd post and if
anyone can add to it :) I'm just listing the nights/places with live DJs

Sunday    - The Pollenator - DJ Spike - house - 21+ - upstairs oakland
beehive.
Monday    - Nothing to do that I know of
Tuesday   - Various at Zythos - 21+ - South side, 2108 E carson.
Tuesday   - Lava Lounge - DJ Spike + guest - House - 21+ - South side,
carson street.
Tuesday   - Every other week at Club Laga various DJs and styles- 18+ -
Oakland
Wednesday - Soba - Various DJs - 21+ - Ellesworth avenue in shadyside.
Thursday  - Metropol - Unknown DJ - 21+ - Strip district
Thursday  - Pegasus  - Unkown - 21+ - Location unknown to me.
Friday    - Cafe' Sip - Various? - All ages - Spahr avenue, shadyside.
Friday    - Zythos - Various djs? - 21+ - 2108 E. Carson.
Saturday  - Soba - Various DJs? - 21+ - Ellesworth Ave in Shadyside.
Saturday  - The Pollenator - DJ Spike - House - 21+ - Upstairs Oakland
Beehive.

Notes:

Zythos has no real dancefloor, but usually great music, and comfy seats, low
cover and alot of cool ppl there. $2 or $3 to get in.
Lava lounge is kinda overly clubbish. - $2 or $3 to get in.
Laga is prolly the most like a Rave of all of them, there's drinking area
too if yer 21+, and free water, it usually runs out tho :( $5 to get in.
Soba had some awesome DJin, kinda clubbish, real nice atmosphere tho.
Metropol has been playing some really good break-beat / Speed Garage / House
lately, however if being in a crowd of about %60 gay bothers you, don't go.
I've heard Pegasus is pretty much gay only, never been, don't have any info
on it.
Cafe' sip doesnt really have a dancefloor either, though you could prolly
push tables aside and make enuf room to bust out?, and smoking area is VERY
small and detached from the rest of the place (20 foot hallway?, can't see a
DJ or a speaker).
Haven't been to a regular full night at the Pollenator yet, so don't know
what it's like.

Disclaimer: No offense to anyone if I missed your event, or stated something
you disagree with... Just trying to state the facts as I see them. If I
missed something please email me, gonna put this on a page after I feel
comfortable about the listing. No offense to gays either... I usually go to
the Metropol event and have a great time, I'm not gay tho so I have no
interest to go to Pegasus, and thought it might be important for others who
share the same views - or even the opposite views :)

i had the *best* time at this party and it was by far one of the best ive been
to yet! i agree that at first a lot of the kids here didnt seem too
approachable but after a few hours everyone was so nice and friendly and it
was such a fun time. i didnt get to meet anyone at the netmeet even tho i was
standing there the whole time.. i guess i sorta felt a little silly and didnt
know what to say to anyone but i still met a ton of kids that nite.. including
a rad kid named sean that blew glitter on my face (haha i guess that was the
trend of the nite) and a cool vegan kid from buffalo named matthew that shares
my love for hardcore (yay snapcase) and a cool guy named jack and his girlie
that introduced my friend and i to a bunch of kids, and a ton of other names
that i dont remember but i remember all the faces so i know ill be seeing you
all again and i cant wait! i think the lineup was excellent, i thought
everyone played a great set and eventho i didnt dance all nite i still had a
blast running around and being silly and just having a great time. i think the
vibe was great and in general everyone i talked to seemed to be having a blast
too! way to go lou and all the people that helped him out that nite.. i just
wanted to add that around 3 or so i was sitting outside cooling off and a
bunch of kids from .. um.. i dont remember where they were from but somewhere
in PA and they drove like, 6 hrs to get there... anyway, they came all that
way and didnt have enough $ to get in and the kids at the door let them in
anyway, which was so nice of them.. can you imagine driving all that way and
being told you had to turn around and go back? now ive been to some other
parties where i could easily see the jerks telling them to do just that, but
it was nice to see some nice people understanding their problem and helping
them out so they could enjoy the evening too. thats about it for me :o)

Just thought I'd mention that I'v got a listing of club nights in
Pittsburgh on the *TECHNOLOGY* homepage that i run.  Its not fancy, but
it's got the info.  Thanks for the post Dan - you had some listed that i
didn't know about (mostly cos i don't go to clubs that are 21+ only).

One note on Pegasus - depending on your taste, the music can be either
really bad or alright.  Primarily its cheesy club house, diva house - and
the play the *same* songs every week (with a little variation).
Occasionally they will play some hard house and speed garage too.  The
place has an awesome vibe though - better than any other pittsburgh club.
And its not exclusively a 'gay club'...although its not everyone's thing.

Thank you, but not really nessasary.

I'm not just talking about old school partys, I am also talking about some
recient ones. I guess I jumped on this "space" party a bit hard, but I hate
hearing shit about Cleveland, and how the scene really sucks. I hate
getting private emails from kids asking what happened to Cleveland.
 I travel alot each weekend all over the country and play at parties that
are sick!! And I'm havin a great time and what happens.... some kids will
come up to me and say, "Oh yea your from Cleveland ...... I went to a party
there once a few months back, and it was booty." This just happened this
past weekend in Texas. Well I always say that not all parties are like
that.
But you know what, I'm gettin sick of trying to explain to people that
Cleveland partys don't suck. It used to be that when people takled about
Cleveland the words were much different,"Yo Cleveland is the bomb, ultra
tight!"

I'm not always negitive ,I'm just seeing reality,  I'm trying to be the
devils advocate. ( but unfortunatly seems like some people on this list are
a bit to slow to see this. If you know me, even a little ,you know I don't
think I'm the king of anything, I'm just a person that has to say what's on
his mind)
 I figure that if someone always brings up the negative parts about a show,
and not just the positive parts , people would realise that some things
need to change. Don't get me wrong, there are some decent parties going on
here in Cleveland, but most are not top quality.

Also, I'm not really trying to slag any one patacular person at all, just
trying to bring the over all quality of parties up in Cleveland. I really
do care about the scene here, even though I take alot of shit because I do.
Please understand that back in the days when I was first startin to do
events, there were 4 or 5 old school club people that would rag on every
show I did.
And I got mad at first... but then I tryed even harder to make the next
show better. This happened for years, and I think each show did improve
over the last one. And don't take this as "I'm the greatest ever, because I
have been to a few  shows thrown here in cleveland that blew some of my
shows away.

Anyways, if you still don't understand my comments ...  sorry, but
hopefully I explained my negative comments enough that you get it??!!

Well, if not ...I'm still the king of Ravers!  ;)

Great listing Dan!  Just wish I was 21 as 90% are 21+ (damn pgh clubs!).
To add some info on Pegasus:

It has 18+ nights on tues and thurs w/ $3 entry (free if you are 21).
Dj's spin mostly gay house (kinda to really cheesy IMHO) with some normal
house thrown in.  All in all the vibe is usually pretty good and I'd say
that 70% of the club is gay and 30% straight.  Everyone seems
to get along pretty well.  Last couple of times I have been there, there
has been a bunch of raver type kids (ahh, generalizations) in addition to
the normal club crowd.  I'm straight and I have a pretty good time there
so I'd recommend it if you are comfertable being in a gay club (you WILL
be hit upon so if that freaks you out you might want to skip it).

pEace,
jP

I'm not bitter at all! I'm glad people are doin events!
 I just want to make sure that they are all good events. And by this I
don't mean huge events, just good ones. I agree with you, from what I've
heard from people Lou/Shortarm seem to be cool guys, so don't take what I
say to be doggin any one patuclar person. ( I mean I didn't say... "SHort
arm sucks" so don't take it that way.)
As in my last post, my intentions for being harsh is to be the devils
advocate... I don't mind if some people don't agree with me, write back an
intelligent counter post and lets sort out some statements.... that's how
people and scenes grow in positive ways.

oops i forgot to say a couple of things:

i completely lost track of time when the net meet was supposed to be. i
think adam x was spinning and i love his track selection but all his
mixing was long slow fades, no tricks, which was making me kind of sleepy
so i laid down for a while and when i got back up mike dearborn was on,
with an equally phat track selection plus mixing tricks all over. =] so i
couldn't miss that, then i looked at my watch + it was 2:30.

and i was glad to see costas too! and steve where were you? i didn't see
you at all.

then what i forgot to say about the afterhours, sorry for the few small
mistakes around the beginning of my set. =/ people told me they loved the
set so that made me happy. while i was spinning there were about 5 people
crowded around me which was really bothering me. i don't know who they 
were. they were going in between me and my records (which were right
behind me) and between me and the turntables. then one of them started
playing with the EQs. that is so rude i can't even explain. so i had to
pretty much push him out of the way to put on another record. brian had
told me spin as long as i want then he would go on next. but these guys
were saying how many more records are you going to play, when i had only
been on for 45 minutes. i wanted to go an hour, but they just kept
bugging me so i said 2 or 3. so he said 2? ok. there was nobody else
around because we were upstairs and i couldn't do anything. anyway they
stole brian's spot to spin. yesterday i found out what the words on
"numbers" by kraftwerk were that i couldn't understand, ichi ni san shi
means 1234 in japanese. i was talking to some japanese friends.

speaking of rude fucking people this isn't really rave-related but i am
totally pissed off since what is like the stupidest thing in the world
that has happened. the night before last it was about 8 at night and i
needed to sleep since i was up almost all weekend but my roommates who are
assholes were being so loud + would not shut up. so i wanted to stay up +
did this big line of crystal which was really dumb because then i passed
out and woke up at 1 am all sick and shaking. so i took a codeine
(painkillers) but i still couldn't sleep. and last night it was 1:30 am
when i needed to go to sleep but my roommates were being even louder and
wouldn't turn down the music when i asked politely. so i turned music on
loud enough to shake the bed and walls and put in earplugs but i could
still hear the music downstairs. somehow i fell asleep and somebody woke
me up at 3:30 because i had a phone call. i don't care if my friends call
and wake me up, but somebody in the house who i couldn't find had another
phone and kept yelling into it and holding down the buttons so i couldn't
even talk longer than 5 seconds. then i just went to my friend's dorm and
slept in his room. i came home at noon to get some things and turned on
some music that was quiet and my roommate started yelling and banging on
the walls. he said "what do you expect! every fucking morning you play the
same fucking shit and wake up everybody!" i don't even play music in the
morning and my music is every possible type of electronic dance music
(except top 40) that i can imagine; i have more than 50 tapes and 20 CDs.
all they play is gangster rap, puff daddy, and the same 10 CDs of
alternative music, at 3x the volume at 3 + 4 am. i'm now sleeping at other
people's places and the studio, and taking showers in the gym, because i
have cleaned the bathroom before, changed the shower curtain, etc. they
haven't done anything for it. there's black + orange mold growing in the
shower, termites coming out of the walls, the floor is sticky, the toilet
is too dirty to sit on, since i gave up on cleaning it after they peed all
over it every day. they are acting like children. i can't wait to move.

from the December '95 PLRM interview w/ DJ Ian Mariano...

<<another thing is i think human history as we know is coming to a 
close becuz right now there=92s so much history available. raw history 
thru the internet, thru underground writing thats never been available
before. technology is more powerful  now in the hands of one person  
than ever before in history. and the reason why events seem to be
happening faster & faster, its becuz the information is more & more
available. when we 1st had to transfer information, it took years to
get from one point to another. and then faster means of transportation
came about that carried information faster. and along came telephone,
then news services then radio & the telegraph, and then the tv, and 
now we have the internet & information is being transfered faster &
faster. & we=92re reaching an attractor point if u will & after that, 
who knows what will happen. its a very delicate time in human history 
& what we=92re doing as the underground scene along with those connected 
by the internet with all this information, is trying to up the people 
to a higher level of thinking then what yur used to. no longer can we
think like our parents did in the 50=92s or the 60=92s. the first death
throes of the way of thinking was the hippy movement & all those people:
Aldus Huxley, Timothy Leary, Terence McKenna..
PLRM: yeah Mckenna was the one that came up with closing date of 2012.
coincidentally its also when the Mayan calendar basically ends.
IAN: there=92s alot of echos in history. there are several similar
parallels. alot of people think america is just fine but we=92re skating 
on thin ice here. there are alot of parallels between america & the 
roman empire.
PLRM: i think one thing i learned when i interviewed Chris & Alex 
from Spawntaneous, as dark as their interview was, it pointed out that
there is definetly something wrong with our system. but our government 
is so bent against change that something is bound to happen whether it 
be a revolution or something.
IAN: there is going to be a revolution, look at the miltias here. 
look at how people do not trust the government. its reaching a point 
of collapse. its a major problem with a non-ecological view of things 
- i mean ecology in its purest sense, the understanding of consequences.
when u do anything there are going to be reprecussions. and u become a
juggernaut like our government is, its very hard to change things from
the way they are. because of the beauracacy. i mean the ideal of america
is still a very good idea. but the execution of that ideal has failed i
believe as a democracy. but i also do believe there=92s hope. and that=92=
s 
why we do this, to show there=92s hope for the future,  that we create
something that will last that will bring people up higher and create a
new synthesis of ideas, information that people have never before seen
on this planet. 
PLRM: i=92m happy u sed that cuz many people who have been involved with
the scene for a long time, all they see is the bad aspects & they lose
faith in it. but if u remember all that u=92ve experienced & u take it in
a but at a time & u analyze it, break it down, & think about it on a
grander scale, that=92s when u learn something. u figure out something is
going on. there can be change. and there can be hope.
IAN: i mean if u stop learning yur dead.  when u close yur mind, 
that=92s the 1st sign that something is very wrong. my greatest joy is
people dancing on the floor, stop, think about it & then continue what
they=92re doing. i like it when they get lost in the music & forget who
they are. they=92re somebody new. u can see it in their eyes when they=92=

really into it. when they start seeing something new & that=92s why i do
it.>>

I don't have lots of time but I just wanted to chime in that this was a
great party.  Amazing music without a single bad point.  I really loved
Juan Atkins, Mike Dearborn and John Kelly.  The others also had awesome
sets.  Cool space with a good sound system and quality lighting.  Its
really sad that the promoters could put together such a good party and
still lose money.  Somebody was saying "whats wrong with commercialism?"
in an earlier post.  If a promoter is very commercialistic their top
priority is to make money.  This promoter was not and their top priority
was to put on a great party and the great results are obviously a product
of their good intentions.  They could have cheaped out on any aspect of
this party and probably made more money but they chose not to and it
shows.
  I had an amazing time.  I was sober, tired and kind of sick but I danced
quite a lot.  (Thanks for the glowsticks Joel.)  The cleveland kids seem
pretty chill.  It was nice to see a pretty diverse looking crowd.  I met a
few cool people.  One cool girl, whose name I forgot, gave Joel and I dope
Mr.  Yuck stickers and little plastic monster finger puppets which fit
nicely on the glowsticks.  I was real tired and I sorta fell asleep for a
while during Baggadonuts set and woke up to John Kelly's sonic assault and
promptly started dancing again.  Its rather surreal sleeping at raves
especially right in the middle of the dance floor.
  Thanks to: the promoters, the DJs, the crew I rode up with, especially
Matt for driving and Costa for being Mr. Vibe and everyone else for being
your cool selves.  The ride was half of the fun.

a reception in ohio that he so greatly deserves...i think it wuz actually one
of the few points of the party where i actually danced (a rarity nowadaze)!

It seem as if the new wave of promoters in Cleveland are promoting to
totally regular headz, (which is cool in moderation, but not when 60% of
the crowd is white trash bullyish assholes)

Again, don't just slag the city because alot of good things happen here in
Cleveland.>>

this is exactly why, when i helped promo for Family Affair and 420,
i specifically only passed out flyers to ravers at partys, for example
w/ 420 the areas i hit the hardest were (in order of # of flyers):
toronto, upstate new york, and columbus...cities that i know that 
have a real good scene and some real kewl kids and are willing to
travel to cleveland for a phat party...but i'll be the first one to tell
u that i've been to some real good partys and some real bad partys
in cleveland!...

...i remember when i drove a rental van full of kids from cleveland to
philly for this party called A Rave Called Scott 2...it took like 9 hours to
get
there...and we had never traveled that far before and didn't realize it would
take that long (we figured philly wuz right next to baltimore which only
takes 6 hours from cleveland)...i had already dropped $140 as deposit for 
the rental van (which wuz a huge gas guzzler)...and one of the kids that
wuz traveling w/ us lost his wallet somewhere along the way (and he was
supposed to pay for another one of the kids)...we were really freakin cuz
we seriously didn't know if we had enough money for gas for the ride home!
...we got to the party @ around 3pm, so i haggled pretty hard w/ the door
guy especially since we missed half the show...i think he eventually let
us in for half price after he learned of our situation, but there really wuz
no way we could have afforded full price @ the door if we wanted to have
enough money for gas on the way back...i remember that party really well
because i had my camera stolen at that party and a few of my other friends
had some of their stuff stolen at that party too (u think theft is bad in
cleveland, u should go to philly!)...we were lucky they didn't take any of 
our wallets!...

...in toronto they give u a $5 discount if u show proof that u came from
across the border...that's a decent deal...but i think any promotor that
has been a raver and has traveled to an out-of-state party should know
to give some kind of discount for the out-of-state ravers...these are the
true 'hardcore' ravers!

Just got back a nice SCJ.  Place was nicely crowded and everyone was
groovin down to all sorts of jungle (must say that the stuff is starting
to grow on me).  Got to chill with some of you pb-cle folk too.

Anywayz, I thought space was a great party.  After this and Cyber Ex I
have begun to expect good things from cleveland parties.  And I must say,
I LOVE the cleveland kids!  I always end up meeting tons of nice people
(and such cute girls!).  This party was no different.  The vibe was right
on with a packed dancefloor and ravers distributing toys, candy, water and
mr. yuck stickers (very cool!).  The music was just about perfect.  Almost
all techno which was a nice change of pace as I've gotten used to jungle
and house.  In particular I thought the atomic babies and Mike Dearborne
(sp?) had wonderful sets.  However, everyone's set was just flawless.  The
space (hehe) was pretty cool as well.  I'm sure shadiness could be found
if you looked in the dark edges but I stayed on the dancefloor for most of
it.  I stayed sober so I ended up getting sleepy and actually took a nap
along with branden and blythe in the middle of the dancefloor!  It was
bizarre to wake up with people dancing all around me and then get up and
join em!  The ride with brendan and all the cmu kids was awesome (though
sometimes scary!).  Stopped at the coolest gas station (it had glowsticks
for 50 cents along w/ lots of raver toys and it was called speedmart with
a cool lil logo).  All the kids I went up with were wonderful!  Anywayz,
I'll be doing a lot more raving in cleveland.

Shout outs to:
the people that DID show up to the net meet
the cool girl (marissa?) that gave me the toys, stickers and herbal E
(fell asleep anywayz)
blythe, branden, costa and donnie; you guys are awesome!
matt, for the ride and the explanation of the evils of refined sugar (bad!
bad! bad!)
all the wonderful cleveland kids that I run into at every party up there,
keep it real!!!!
shortarm for throwing a crazynice party, sorry you lost money

pEace,
jP

 The Hacker's Manifesto

Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. 
"Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after 
Bank Tampering"...Damn kids. They're all alike. But did you, in your 
three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind 
the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what 
forces shaped him, what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world...

Mine is a world that begins with school...I'm smarter than most of the
other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...Damn underachiever. They're 
all alike. I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers 
explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. 
"No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..." Damn kid. 
Probably copied it. They're all alike. I made a discovery today. I found 
a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If 
it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't 
like me...Or feels threatened by me... Or thinks I'm a smart ass...Or 
doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...Damn kid. All he does is 
play games. They're all alike. And then it happened... a door opened 
to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an 
addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the 
day-to-day incompetencies is sought...a board is found. "This is 
it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even if 
I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them 
again... I know you all...Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. 
They're all alike...You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been 
spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak...the bits 
of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. 
We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few 
that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are 
like drops of water in the desert. 

This is our world now...the world of the electron and the switch, 
the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing 
without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by 
profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and 
you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us 
criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without 
religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, 
you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe 
it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. 
My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what 
they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting 
you, something that you will never forgive me for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, 
but you can't stop us all...after all, we're all alike.

Well,

pHryL. has the pleasure to announce to all of you that any US resident (with
a show of proper ID) will be allowed to PROGRESS for only $15US at the door.
We feel that we are offering the ultimate bargain here - seeing a top notch
line-up with some of the best artists Europe has to offer in the world of
Techno and drum and bass.

We are also inviting anyone who has never attended a Toronto party before to
come join us and experience something that you will not forget soon. If you
have ever talked to someone who has partied in Toronto, you know why I say
this. If you haven't, try it for yourself.

Another quick bit of news is that ADAM BEYER, CARI LEKEBUSCH and CHRISTIAN
SMITH (NEUROMANCER) will be performing a 6 hour 3 turntables tag-team. Such
a treat by DJ's of this magnitude has only been performed once before when
ADAM, CARI and JOEL MULL did it at the ENERGY party in Zurich, Switzerland
last August in front of 26,000 people. So, this is something that will be a
North American first.

Also, stay tuned for 'sub pHunC 27' coming in Pittsburgh in collaboration
with House of Styles on May 16 for another talent packed line-up.

I'm feeling especially famous today, everyone.  My friend Stephan put a
whole bunch of pictures I sent him on his webpage.  There are a few
Pittsburgh ravers on there and some friends of mine from here that are
ravers from other places on the globe, and of course...ME!!!!!

webpage:
www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/2955
actual pictures:
www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/forbidden/124/picseng.html

I'm also famous today because I was quoted TWICE in the paper.  They had
someone covering the subculture program.  First they misquoted me and made
me a year lower than I am, but I wrote them a letter about that.  The
second quote was "I don't use drugs.  I don't subscribe to that
lifestyle," said Weber, who has been a raver for the past 2 1/2 half
years.  "Weber said the type of lifestyle she does subscribe to is a sort
of ideology or philosophy of the rave culture called PLUR (Peace, Love,
Unity, Respect."  

Hee hee, these are only the FIRST fifteen minutes of my fame!!

Love ya,
Jenifer Foulmood

they played shitty music, if this place dies, there will be no place that i
know of, except u4ia (filled with middleschoolers) in the cleve area to
go.....

the agora and its security suck ass. they tried confiscating vapo rub, not
to mention tons of empty and unopened water bottles. i wouldn't be
surprised if they confiscated prescription drugs that prevent life-
threatening conditions.

For those of you not already aware, I've taken over the duties of
both calendar maintenance and calendar list administration for
mw-raves.  Since this area also includes Ohio, I've also crossposted
this to pb-cle-raves.

Along with one-off events, raves, parties and general "git-downs"
that I'd appreciate getting info on in my mailbox, I also maintain a
list of weekly club events.  While for some states I have lots of
info (Illinois), others I have little (Indiana) or none at all (the
Dakotas and Tennessee).  C'mon.  I'm sure there are plenty of places
near where you live where you go to get some type of groove on when
you can't get to that local megarave(tm).  E-mail me and tell me
about it.

I'm also attempting to build a list of streaming audio sites within
the midwest area.  These could employ RealPlayer or any other type
of streaming audio/video technology, as long as the stream is of
relevance to mw-raves (ie, techno/ambient/etc. music).  If you're
involved with any site in any way or know of any, please e-mail me
privately and let me know the URL, showtimes, etc.

Finally, I'm trying to create a directory of contact points within
the midwest for promotional groups and info lines.  If there's a
promotional group or some guy/girl you know who's running a
voicemail or a website that has information, get in touch with me.

Places to check:

	http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/mw/mwravescalendar
	http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/mw/mwravesclubs

Above all, realize that these compliations are _our_ responsbility.
They're only as useful as we make them.  That is to say, the more
time and effort we all put into keeping my mailbox filled with the
latest and most accurate information, the more complete and
ultimately valuable these resources become.  If there's something
you'd like to see but don't, or something you don't think should be
there but is... let me know.

I look forward to hearing from you.



- Craig

we'll mail you some flyers for next week's reinforced tour stop here in
columbus, to anyone who provides us with the following info: 

- your name
- your mailing address
- quantity desired
- your reason for wanting that quantity

we have already mailed some to the major record stores but if there's a
place where you think these things may go QUICK (the show is next friday,
after all), or if you could be so kind as to hand a few out wherever you
go after you get them, we'll send more.  

we do need everyone's help on this one!  this event means so much to the
ele_mentals (as we have been reinforced headz since back in the day) but
the short time we've had to get it together means no one knows about this
only midwest appearance of the drum'n'bass pioneers.  so if you can spread
the word, just specify how many you want and we'll try to suit your needs. 

we usually honor most requests, but if you don't get yours by say, next
wednesday, it's because the mail lost them or we ran out of money.

so start typing...we need some little elves out there to get this thing
talked about...

ok this is simple, and i have said it before. big pants can be found for
cheap all over the place. discount stores like gabriel brothers have them
sometimes and i have never seen them cost more than $20 there. sometimes
they are on sale at a big department store (like j.c. penneys and
kaufmanns). they can also be found on sale once in a while at the small
stores like gadzooks and pacific sunwear, but that doesn't happen often.
now is probably a good time to look, because of winter clearance (they're
making room for shorts). and when one of those stores goes out of business
all the clothes are like half price or less. i got these pants i'm wearing
for $15 when merry go round went out of business about 2 years ago. anyway
you can't always find them for really cheap, just keep looking hard. i
don't understand why anybody pays $60 for pants.

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org

Hello,
Mr. Negitivity here! And I'm in disbelief!!
Cleveland...... Doc Martin played in here last night at U4IA!!!????
Hello..... Doc Martin??!!!........... Did people forget???
Alow me to break it down... 280 people for Doc Martin??????????
280 people came out to hear one of the best house Djs there is!!??
(Mean while, a few months back, 1300 people came to see lady miss Keir, who
while looking really good, and being really nice, can't spin her way out of
a paper bag!!??!!)
People always come up to me saying , "Man no one every brings any one good
into the clubs in Cleveland", or "Man there's nothing to do here,no good
clubs, Cleveland sucks".
Well...... ARRRGGGHHHH  people try to bring people in  and look what
happens.... 280 people.
I can understand some people had to work in the morning, and some had
school... but I know that alot of people just didn't come. People need to
support events like this in order for them to keep happining! Not to
mention that Doc probably felt pretty unappreciated, and will probably
think twice before returning to Cleveland.
And on top of the low attendence... I saw one of the rudest things I have
ever seen at a show. The dancing boxes set up infront of the dj..... People
were sitting down on them facing away from the Dj. I mean they were like 5
feet in front of Doc,... sitting there looking the other way.
Doc asked me if that was a Cleveland thing to Sit on the Dancing boxes and
seem uninpressed. I told him not really....and a .... those people were
from a special school, that a...... only let there patients...er a students
out once in a while.... YEA that's the ticket! I felt like a moron!

Please write to the list and tell me why only 280 people show up to see Doc
Martin.
Peace , but no respect for anyone without a really good excuse for not
being there last night.
Sleepy C

ps. just incase you were wondering... I had nothing to do with the Doc show
last night, so don't think I'm upset for $$$ reasons... I just bummed that
Our City dosn't know or respect real tallent, real deep, as good as it
get's, no flash but a lot of true tallent, tallent.
Maby 1300 people will come if Doc wore a dress and called himself Lady Miss
Martin??!!

Hey, Doc is one of my favorite dj's too, along with Lady Miss Kier, cuz
i'm a big Deee-Lite fan, but i don't usually whine when i miss a show, I
live about an hour from cleveland so i know that i won't be able to make
alot of shows.  I would have went to the show, but i had school at 8 am
the next morning, otherwise, i definitely would have been there.

Matthew

*Brian giggles a bit cuz he's thought U4ia has always been better than
 Trilogy*

...at least since pleasure began.  I like 'Real' a lot too, but it's 21+
now :(  Trilogy I just burned out on.  Too many undesireables....ie
strippers and the 35-40 year old drunk males watching them.

my two bits, :)

I went last night and to be totally honest I wasn't all that impressed.  It
was alright but I wasn't blown away or nuthin'.  Maybe that's because I'm not
a DJ so I don't "appreciate" his skills but his records didn't grab me.

As for Miss Lady Keir, I love dnb with the raps on top so that's why I went
then, but I think a lot of people went because it was the day before
thanksgiving-it's a party night.

One last point, what's up with the little freestyle battles?  Don't get me
wrong, I apreciate psycho dancing, god knows if i'm not already in pain, I'm
movin'.  But once they were goin' at it no one else was dancing, they were all
just watching whoever was up.  I don't know about you, but I think that was
kind of dissin' him to.

I just don't like people using the floor to show off...I mean I don't think I
saw anyone do more than just random moves.  Not once did I see someone explode
when a break came or anything.

btw, I was right in front FACING the dj.

I was really surprised that two weeks ago when John Acquaviva was at u4ia
there were even LESS people. It seemed like there were a lot more people
dancing for Doc Martin than for Aquaviva, and there looked as though there
was a larger crowd. It might have only looked that way because the second
half was not closed off. The question that I have about all of this is
whether a) people these days just don't know who these djs are and don't
know what they are missing or b) people are just lazy/tired/busy and don't
show up. 

In any case, I was there and had a really really really
great time both nights. Personally, I thought Aquaviva's set was more
interesting and more skillful than Doc Martin's. Doc had a few crappy
mixes and there seemed to be a few problems with the sound. However, the
house he plays is more dancer and Cleveland-friendly than Aquaviva's. In
any case, both were a great time, and I am glad u4ia is still bringing in
some great djs! I'm just waiting for the next big d&b dj that will be
here (hopefully not LMKier again! :/) Any news?? 

PS- What is with the cost of the same beer being a different price at the
different bars at u4ia? Now that was strange... ;)

well, mr. c, i was going to write to you about your post from monday (where
you had to explain to the kid from texas that not all cle parties are
lousy), but you kinda said some of the things i was going to say
already.....

but before i say *anything* i want to start out on the right foot...i don't
leave my house much and i know about three people in this town and i've got
_nothing_ personal against _anyone_ (well ok..ONE person but... that's
*personal* and not important for this discussion).  but i am not here to
talk down the cleveland scene or any cleveland people--djs, dancers,
drinkers, dumbasses alike, they all create the "scene".  And if i had
anything to say bad about anyone it would have been YOU, sir, for putting
those ~swim/g~man tracks on your now historical driving music promo
tape...but the truth is that i totally dug them and felt completely
vindicated after getting a lot of heat in chicago for playing "that slow
shit"  ;)  but i am going to be direct and critical, and i want that all to
be taken as constructive criticism.  If i didn't care about cleveland, i
wouldn't spend the time and energy to reply.

>People always come up to me saying , "Man no one every brings any one good
>into the clubs in Cleveland", or "Man there's nothing to do here,no good
>clubs, Cleveland sucks".


obviously, you and i both know this is an untrue statement.  Talented and
"name" acts (not always the same) alike come here regularly...at least once
or twice a month to spice up the suprising and varied local flavor.  As to
not being any good clubs, i'm not much of a clubber but i've hit the big
ones -- trilogy & u4ia several times each and i've always come away with the
reaction same: needs work.  It's not something i can really put my finger on
because, as i said, i'm not a club person.  I personally would prefer a
dirty, dark, hard-to-find warehouse with a single 40watt light bulb so long
as it had a urinal and a water fountian.  tho these glitzy fancy clubs can
be great for proper light displays and expensive drinks, but I'm kinda
turned off by the quality of u4ia's sound system and the clientele that
surrounds me when i go to trilogy.  And i went to some really nice club just
on the west bank where swamp did some experimental thing sometime last month
i think it was.  that was a super nice space and the freight elevator would
have been a nice touch had it worked, but they needed some real lights, a
real sound system, and a coat check.

...do you see what I'm getting at so far?  i've yet to mention the music,
but the _environment_ has to be done right.  You don't have to have
something mad fancy, but what is worth doing is worth doing right.
environment is a huge part of the experience.

the best regular events i've been to since i've lived here (almost a year)
have been at that spot on Detroit avenue accross from that rough 1stop gas
station or whatever it is.  those booty house/jungle events that alex was
doing at the start of last summer.  i've also been to several fantastic more
artsy events in the space below it.  nothing fancy, nothing great, but it
felt somehow genuine.  maybe it was me, dunno.

>Well...... ARRRGGGHHHH  people try to bring people in  and look what
>happens.... 280 people.
>I can understand some people had to work in the morning, and some had
>school... but I know that alot of people just didn't come. People need to
>support events like this in order for them to keep happining! Not to

got to work in the morning.  got to work at EIGHT AM in the morning.  my
alarm goes off at 5:59:59 and i'm out of the house by seven ... if i got
home by twelve thirty i'd be out all the time but that's not reality.
reality is whoever makes these schedules thinks it's a saturday and the main
act should start at twelve thirty or one and go until two or two thirty.  so
i'll get home by.....three? three thirty?  four?   nope.  not me.  i've got
a life.  if it's raving or clubbing vs paying the rent, sick as it sounds
i'm for paying the rent.  i tried the other--it doesn't work.  and oh, four
hours of undertalented kids playing before that late act doesn't help much.

and before i go on....there are things to do here on several nights of the
week: sunday, wednsday, thursday, etc  but never anything regular (that
lasts) on friday or saturday nights...friday especially--the ONE night i
ever really want to go out.  I have no, repeat NO desire to begin promoting
here...not because of the scene, but because i'm just too dang busy...but
there's a huge defacit of stuff to do for people like us on fridays.  ANY
PROMOTERS OUT THERE? *taps on monitor, screams into mouse* CAN YOU HEAR ME?

>And on top of the low attendence... I saw one of the rudest things I have
>ever seen at a show. The dancing boxes set up infront of the dj..... People

>feet in front of Doc,... sitting there looking the other way.


i've seen this in every city in the midwest to degrees proportional to how
much energy the crowd had and how much fun they were having.  two a.m. on a
thursday morning i want to be between the sheets snoozin not having my
hearing stolen by a substandard sound system....even if the music was good
and well played.  So the question i want to ask is not why were those people
sitting there, why were they rude, but why were they even at the club at
aLL.

Hmmmm....how interesting....people really do find knowledge to be half the
battle.  So, does anyone here admit to making snap judgements based purely
on how one is dressed?  I know I do.  Can we help it?  Do we judge each
other on how we're dressed.  If I walked into a raved dressed in little
pants and started to bust a move, would I be given funny looks?  If
someone walked in dressed in a prom dress, would they be given funny
looks?  I almost feel as if we've started to judge each other in silliest
of ways.  Didn't ravers once party in the most outrageous of gear, wearing
pajamas to pajama party-inspired raves, wearing fuzzy pants, plastic
pants, crazy crazy stuff?  Have we grown lethargic in our fashion ways?

[snip]

So then, what did you do about it?

Did you speak with a manager?  Explain the situation?  Point out the
security personnel that grabbed you?  Demand an apology or some sort
of compensation?

So then, what are you going to do about it?  If things haven't
changed either in staff, management or policy... who is to blame?
Them for treating their customers like punks, or their customers who
act like ones by tolerating it?

After reading Stevie T's message about the Taggin' thing, i figure i'd
share a little saddening tidbit that I forgot about in the afterglow of
CHEER...

Apparently some punks decided to tag all over the bathrooms of the Irish
Center during House of Style's last rave, CHEER, and so because of it they
lost their clean-up deposit, and its getting increased by $200 for events
there in the future. BTW: HofS lost money on that event! :(  To me that
just really sucks - i mean, the irish center is *the* venue for pittsburgh
- we can't really afford to disrespect it.  I don't figure anyone on this
list is the kind of punk that would do that kind of stuff, but if you know
kids who are - give em' a big ole' pimp slap from me.

now doesn't that just brighten up your day?

<< So, does anyone here admit to making snap judgements based purely
 on how one is dressed?  I know I do.  Can we help it?  Do we judge each
 other on how we're dressed.  If I walked into a raved dressed in little
 pants and started to bust a move, would I be given funny looks?  If
 someone walked in dressed in a prom dress, would they be given funny
 looks?  I almost feel as if we've started to judge each other in silliest
 of ways.  Didn't ravers once party in the most outrageous of gear, wearing
 pajamas to pajama party-inspired raves, wearing fuzzy pants, plastic
 pants, crazy crazy stuff?  Have we grown lethargic in our fashion ways?

     Hmmmm ... I always here everyone talk about how people shouldn't be
judged on the way they dress, but I think that's so silly.  It's well-meaning
liberal thinking bent all outta shape.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I think
it's stupid to think a person HAS to be a certain way just because he or she
dresses a certain way, but the way a person dresses can be SO very useful many
times in getting an idea of what they're about.  I mean, fashion is a form of
communication just like all other art.  No one would ever say "Don't judge a
person on what they say".  Well, to me, what a person says and how a person
dresses are so closely related.  They're both just a mixture of conscious and
unconscious communication.  
     Also, this isn't really a reply to your letter Jenifer.  Your letter
seemed to focus more on the problem of the homogeneity of raver fashion.  I
just wanted to express myself and test the waters here for this idea.

I accidently deleted the post, but this is in regards to the way security
treated stevie T (that's right, right?).

Anyway, as far as complaining to management(that spelling's probably
wrong, my brain's on crack today), you really should because they can only
change what's wrong if they know what's wrong.  If they don't change
what's wrong, well then, they're wrong, and you might want to think about
not patronizing (is that right?) them.  

On the other side, however, it can be very difficult to speak up when
you've been wronged.  I know this because my neighbor's alarm went off all
weekend and I still haven't been able to confront her about it!  Give the
boy a break, he might be too shy for his own good!

Well, it looks like the only word I can spell to day is "wrong".  Don't
even mention dictionary!  I left mine at home and everytime I GO home, I
forget to bring it back with me!  It's very frustrating!

Well, I guess I haven't really been expressing my self very well, lately.
These are my thoughts:  I do feel as if how we dress says something about
our personalities in that we make the choice to wear a certain article of 
clothing.  We pick it up off of the floor (usually in my case) and adorn
our earthy bodies with it for one reason or another, be it subconscious or
an actual effort to impress.  What IS upsetting is the stereotyping that
happens as a result of many people wearing similar types of clothing.
Take goths for example.  Many people look at them and their black clothing
and think they must be depressed or satanists or whatever.  In reality,
some goths really are depressed, but then again, many are happy just being
really quiet; some like black because they hate having to color
co-ordinate.  Go figure. It really depends on the individual and being
lumped together as the same being kills the individual's meaning.

Many times we look at each other and we end up stereotyping ourselves.
Looking at a candy raver, many peole think drugs and sugar.  While many
candy ravers are also drug-users, there are still many who DO NOT use
drugs and pretty much despise it's usage.  They might just like the
glitter, the childish look, the squishy way candy ravers just seem to be.  

I don't like how if you dress one way on any given day, you're
automatically labeled into whatever group.  I love clothes.  I love phat
pants.  I love black vinyly pants.  I love dresses.  I love mod.  I love
goth.  I love the 70's, the 80's, victorian stuff.  I love corsets!  Some
day I want to pair a really nifty corset with some phat pants.  I can't
wait til my hair is long so I can do wonderfully different things with it!
I get SO BORED with one style.  I think people should costume themselves.
Dress like a school girl cause you feel childish.  Dress like a mod cause
you're feeling very brit-pop.  

Sorry to rant.  I feel like a diva!

Chalk it up to boredom, I'm sorry I'm posting so much.  Maybe I'm just
getting back into the swing of things.  Anyway....

Does anyone else kind of wish that other forms of music were spun at
raves?  I just hear songs that I wish I could dance to in a rave
situation.  There are some Portishead songs I'd love to get my body
on.  I also hear just regular old house or jungle or trance songs that I
NEVER hear played at parties!  On a different note, there are songs that I
wish would be remixed into jungle versions.  Has anyone heard the new Ani
DiFranco album?  There's a bit called Fuel that would make a really nifty
jungly song.  I wish I could spin and produce so I could just do it
myself.  When you want something done and all.  I'd also like to hear
classical bit mixed or sampled in.  Just a thought from the thought
factory.

Definitely!  The RedHeaded StepChild plays the occasional
Portishead and Tricky tune, although he rarely gets booked.  I think other
music can fit into the environment of a rave very well - i'd love to see
it.  In fact, I wish people would even just play some of the different
tunes that even fall within the realm of rave music -there's so much
quality stuff that doesn't get a chance in loo (sp?) of the 'anthems'...

Same here.  Of course songs i think deserve a junglized treatment might
not be agreed upon...like Hammer's "U Cant Touch This" with a really dark
Ed Rush Treatment would be evil. :)  On another note, theres an
interesting mixtape i heard about called "The Best of Milli Vanilli" (i
can't remember who its by, but its in the resonance records catalog
online).  The dj uses all jungle remixes of popular artists or jungle
tunes with popular artist (micheal jackson, the busta ones, the spice
girls, etc..) acapellas.  I'd like to hear it at least....

Hey - I'm working on the jungle/classical megamix - I'v got 5 tunes with
classical samples, and am working on fitting them together.  I'l letcha
know.

Well, as the promoter of wednesday nights at maxwells, all i can say is i am
sorry. I can't believe this happened. I have never had any other complaints
about this sort of thing. I will Talk with the owner and see what i can do so
that this doesn't happen again.

Absolutely. As an old schooler (tm) I was around when it was like this.
That was back in like'92 and part of '93. Around  the fall and winter of
'93 and on into '94 eveything and everyone went dark. NO MORE FUN & GAMES.
RAVIN' IS SERIOUS BIZNESS! So that was reflected in the attitudes (dawn of
the gangsta aka polo raver), music (anyone remember Darkside Breakbeat
(hint, it was a precursor to "drum & bass" and dark tribal house?) , and
fashion (this was the debut of the "raver uniform" ie: big shirt, 'phat
pants' and  Adidas sneakers.

> Have we grown lethargic in our fashion ways?

Not so much lethargic as conformists.  "Back in the day" you used to go to
a rave and not know who or what might show up. I remember one party where
some kid came covered in green fur (that must have got hot considering it
was the middle of summer). It also wasn't uncommon to see a more diverse
mixture of people than you see now.

        There was a wider range of ages and demographics  older clubbers
would show up to see what this new "rave thing" was about. Punks would show
up.  Goths would show up. Metalheads would show up. Drag queens would show
up. Strippers would show up. Most of the more interesting people fashion
wise became un-interested in the scene through the years as it became
increasingly homoginized suburban teenagers (no offense to anyone who as a
teenager grew up in the suburbs) who brought with them the attitudes (ie:
wannabe gangsterism, conformity with their peers - other ravers, and a
rather bland sense of fashion).  This only happened here in the USA and to
a lesser extent in Canada (from what I can tell). People still dress pretty
freaky overseas. When I was in Israel everyone wore alot of really colorful
stuff and there were all sorts of "freaks" there. Very few "phat pants"
though. Phat pants actually a joke to most people from overseas - you have
to admit they do look rather silly especially when they are so big that you
can barely dance without tripping over the material.

        I wouldn't be suprised if as the new millenium approaches and a new
generation of ravers enters the scene that things don't get a bit wackier
than they are now. Everything goes in cycles and most of the people I talk
to now are bored to death of this one.

Did someone say Portishead? hehe, i'm a big portishead fan, and i agree
there should be a wider variety of music played, perhaps even reggae?  I
thought that's what chill rooms were for at some parties.  I've never been
to one that had a chill room, but i thought there might have been trip hop
dj's spinning in those rooms.

I'm completely with Jenifer on this one -- different kinds of music at raves
would be great.  Even certain techno that never gets played at parties would be
great -- like Underworld and Juno Reactor and Orbital.  Yeah -- huge names in
the business right now (well, maybe not J.R. so much as the other two), but
that's only because it's such freakin' good music!  And yes, Portishead would
rule.  

Oh -- and for the people who went to Metamorphosis last fall in Columbus --
remember when *some dj/don't remember who* started playing Billy Joel and then
mixed it with a decent beat and some bass?  Well, some people may have hated it
but I thought it ruled.  Incidentally, Orbital does some great mixing with
Belinda Carlisle ...

As per the other music thing, I could appreciate some more variety, but...
portishead?  I only have the most recent album, and it's nothing to dance
to, IMO.  Heck, it's nothing to smile to - most tracks seem like they
belong in a funeral.  So if you hear any portishead at a party, I'll be the
one sobbing in the corner :)

Well, I'll admit, I recently bought the new album, and I don't love
it...yet.  You might check out the "Dummy" album (no wisecracks!).  And
anyways, who wants a world full of happy, happy, joy, joy albums and
artists?  That would be boring beyond belief!!  Everybody's sad
sometimes!!

So the trance is gone from Trilogy.  Big Deal.  No one had been dancing to
it the last 6 months anyhow.  In fact, if you paid attention, whenever
trance was playing the dancefloor was full of old men standing in front of
the speakers.  It was to a point when you could watch a MAJOR change of
dancefloor activity from trance to house.  The people standing around
would leave, and then people would start dancing again.  It would be nice
if some of the remaining dj's would incorporate elements of trance into
their sets -- but, alas, I don't see that happening :(  Its nice to know
that Ian had enough integrity to not alter his sound, but look what
happened.  I only wonder if that will one day happen to house music and
the dj's playing it.

Once again -- as with all the posts of late on this newsgroup -- support
your scene, if you don't it will dissapear. 

Just to proove a point... gotta cut and paste this...
>>know of, except u4ia (filled with middleschoolers) in the cleve area to
>>go.....

First off, IMHO, Trilogy is a better space.  But, it has been ruined (like
ANY good space) by the cheeseball pick-up crowd.  Unless you are in the
fun areas, the bar crowd there sucks.  U4ia is a lovely space, but several
of us were talking wednesday at doc martin, and it just doesn't feel
comfortable.  Its almost too nice.  Plus, you have to contend with their
regular clientele which can at times be as annoying as the guidos at
Trilogy. However, U4ia is MUCH more tolerable in that aspect.  

The thing that is so HYSTERICAL about the Trilogy/U4ia comparison is,
well, the house dj's are still the same.  At least for Sunday/Church - I
think Friday and Saturday Trilody has different Dj's.  MY POINT:  I don't
see how the music can be much different when the same dj's are
playing both nights in question. 

Now mind you, U4iA has done a BRILLIANT job at trying to bring in the
best dj's in the world -- but no one cares enough to support it.
WHY?   Is it because of inconsistensies in the quality of the dj's?   Is
it because its a midweek event?  Is it the space?  Is it the promoter?  Is
it just simply the fact that no one cares?  It certainly is odd, that is
for sure.  Did people just not KNOW Doc Martin was gonna be there?  I
wonder if people from out of town would have traveled had they known.  If
you are part of this list, and not a trilogy-pleasure-whatever regular ---
would *YOU* have known about it if you didn't read it here?


Also, to trouty, from what I understand, 1148 is now back to
ghetto-hip-hop on sunday as they were years ago, and the space where real
was held has been closed down.  Both these events have been gone for at
least 3-4 weeks.  I could be wrong, but you know how gossip travels.

Oh, well, I ended up cover two posts at once... oops.

friday and sunday at trilogy are both fun.
i don't know about the friday dj's, but it is like a small sunday.  not as
busy, but better people usually :)  no backroom, either.  the music is a
little bit harder, almost techno, but there is no jungle.  the music on sunday
is more underground, but it gets boring sometimes.  i usually dance all night
on fridays.

last time I was at trilogy on saturday it was cheesy radio music.

The Allegheny Board of Licenses recently passed a resolution creating a
special ordinance requiring a special party permit for all gatherings in
any structure within any residential or commercial zone.  If the
gathering is more than 40 persons a permit must be applied for and
purchased.  The base permit costs $15 for application fee and $27.50 for
a permit for a party of up to 40 people.  For 40 more persons the permit
goes up to $38.50.  This means a permit for a party of no more than 80
persons will cost $81.00!  

Fines for those not having the proper permits will be fined $150 for the
first forty people and an additional $60 for each aditional group of
forty.  Partying is about to get expensive.

hm, I'm not sure about this one... sure juno reactor and underworld have
put out some good stuff, but they're turning pretty commercial. _and_
jr's last album pretty much sucked... I really enjoy all of these groups
older stuff more than what they're doing now... maybe it's because
they've started to make it big and are making their music more
"accessable" or maybe they're just not as inspired... who knows. a major
reason I like raves is that a lot of the music is *new* or at least I
haven't heard it much (although this has not been the case at scj
lately.) that's my whole problem with commerical radio- they play the
same stuff so much that it just gets plain boring. even the best music
starts to lose its glitter when you've heard it 10 million times. (hey
hey low attention span here) 
anyway, I guess my point is that portishead, jr, etc. are already
getting played in other places, so why should a dj spin them at a rave?

(take me underground)

So the latest rumor is that I was in hypervinyl and Trevor was talking to
somebody about Rachel and the Ghetto Booty Battle etc.  And what he said
was:
1) she has no space
2) the Beastie Boys aren't coming
3) her main investor moved to florida (or somewhere else far away, I
can't remember)

Now, this should be taken with a grain of salt because I've heard Trevor
talking about his disbelief in this party before he really knew any
information on it.  But who knows . . . . . .

I HOPE it happens, although at this point things are looking grim.

ABSOLUT

PS-She is selling advance tickets already.  That takes some guts if what
Trevor said is currently true.

I think a variety of music genres is always good. It keeps you guessin at
what'll be played next. I was just listening to Velvet Underground and
Nico and was gettin a groove on in my room by myself! just think of the
possibilities if it were sampled in dnb songs or remixed? Man, I think the
songs on that cd rock as they are but i sure would be intrested in a tape
with some mixed tunes from the cd. Just my 2 cents.

Are you sure about that whole having to pay that permit thing?

That seems a little unlikely I mean that would mean if you want to have a
birthday party somewhere you'd have to pay for a permit.  That would also
mean that any concert is going to have to pay a shitload of money more. 
Also, how is one supposed to know how many people are going to show up
for an event?  

If that's for real its some mad bullshit.

Where did you get thsi information?

hey kids-well, i spoke with my friend neil last night and he's helping this
girl out with the party.  The beastie boys are definitely NOT COMING but their
dj is (to the kids who were at spontaneous combustion-aren't you excited?  :P
).  He said the reason for this is because if the beastie boys did come, as
was planned, it would 1)be the biggest party in the country and 2) they
wouldn't be able to accomodate all those people and 3) they don't want to
accomodate all those people.  also, i saw the flier set-up and it's really
really phat.  if you guys see a flier with fat albert spinning and his kids
breaking floating around grab one because that's for the infamous GBB.
alright, that's all i gots ta say.  
much love,
   sharon

If I were in a club and two security guards were to physically grab
me and lead me into a bathroom with the idea of accusing me of doing
something that I didn't do... I would _certainly_ have gone to the
management, explained the situation, and have _expected_
reparations.    

> plus the guard will most probably learn from this incidence
> and will not repeat the same mistake again...

What will the guard learn?  That if they didn't get the guy who did
it this time, maybe the next customer they manhandle might be the
one?  Physically restraining customers should always be the very
last resort, and only when employees have not only physically
witnessed the customer doing something wrong, but have legal grounds
to believe that the customer would try to escape.

I believe, as Thomas Jefferson did, that if you don't stand up for
your rights then you don't deserve having them in the first place.
When situations such as you descirbed go unchecked, it's as if
you're saying, "hey, that's okay, I don't mind being physically
assaulted and wrongfully accused."

Never tried to justify it.  Please quote me where you thought I
did.

I didn't quote him, I believe all I did was indicate agreement with
one of his beliefs. 

Jefferson championed the natural right of expatriation and the
gradual emancipation of all slaves.  His earliest legislative effort
had been one to secure to master the freedom to free their slaves
without removing them from the State.  It was unsuccessful, but a
bill he introduced to prohibit the importation of slaves was passed
in 1778.

...along with being one of the founders of our country, noted
statesman, scholar, linguist, mathematician and a bunch of other
things.  I don't agree with everything he did and said, but some of
his stuff was IMO, quite sound and admirable.

 i guess the big preflyers must have just come out because i got one
 saturday. the whole design looks pretty amateur. the front is a
 graffiti-style sketch in pencil, which isn't drawn particularly well, just
 ok. if a flyer is going to have graffiti types of pictures on it, they
 should at least be done in paint (and photographed and scanned), or in
 marker, or done on the computer from the start. the pencil looks pretty
 crappy. the back is done in 5 (FIVE!) dfferent fonts, including one
 really obnoxious crooked, spiky serifed one. and it looks kind of just
 thrown together. (go ahead call me a design snob ;) ) also there are 6
 really obvious misspellings (i'm quoting now):
 
 suberban knight
 minnasota
 boo willams
 strickly jazz unit
 dj assualt (2x)
 
 i don't know if "kenneth grahm" is spelled like that or not. it's pretty
 sad that somebody probably actually got paid to "design" this flyer. 
 anyway, i would like to see dj assault + james pennington + woody mcbride,
 but i doubt the whole thing would be worth it.

I know this reply mail is a little late in coming, but I just saw it as I was
cleaning out some old mail from my box.  Just as Steve (Sleepy C) has nothing
to do with the production or promotion of 420 this year, neither does my
brother, DJ Kevy Kev, who also has a hand in this project (does the flyers and
spins one night of the three). He didnt do that pre-flyer you saw and has not
yet been commissioned to do the main flyer, as Chris from Spawntaneous can't
seem to get his act together, on WHO the acts are actually going to be, or so
I am told. So those of you who have seen the past 420 flyers hopefully will
know the difference between the work of kg2 graphix (dj kevy kev) and the shit
that is out there right now. 
Just wanted to clear that up in case anyone else was wondering. I hope this
event ends up being better than it is shaping up to be right now...

I guess it was a toss up whether to get RAKIM or   Run DMC!!  It would have

Woah - where did this come from all of a sudden?  Its not as if there are
billions of raves that are making loads of money around here - quite to
the contrary.  Can you tell me where you found out about this?  Thats
absultely absurd.  What are their grounds for such an ordinance?

~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~++~ 

In March AOL Watch uncovered bounties -- sometimes as high as $6-per-head
-- paid to customer service agents who convince AOL's customers not to
cancel their accounts.  ( http://www.aolsucks.org/list/0091.html )  Just
days later, the Washington Post reported on AOL's plan for a "broad
internal campaign" to address subscriber concerns (noting that some
critics "charge that AOL's telephone agents make it difficult for users to
cancel their accounts...") 

 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1998-04/02/139l-040298-idx.html

The Washington Post cites a subscriber whose request to cancel AOL
"repeatedly was ignored by customer-service representatives," as AOL
continued billing for seven months -- and then offered a refund for only
$29.85 of the $99.50 charges. 

The paper notes the 66-year-old woman eventually did receive a full refund
-- only after inquiries from a reporter! 

AOL assured the paper they were committed to their users -- but
subscribers don't buy it. "I've seen the lack of empathy AOL exhibits
towards its customer base," one Wired News reader complained, citing an
"overreaching marketing team with no concept of its customers' true
needs."  ( http://www.wired.com/news/news/wiredview/story/11462.html ) 

AOL is even having trouble providing basic services like e-mail.  Their
system status reports showed that for nearly four hours early Monday
morning, "Up to 5% of mail was unavailable at any given time due to
periodic system maintenance."  It's not the first time.  After nationwide
outages in January, February, and March, Bloomberg News reported that on
March 26, nearly 25% of AOL's members couldn't access e-mail! 

		http://www.aolsucks.org/list/0092.html 
		http://www.aolwatch.org/bloomberg1.htm

A company spokesman told the news service AOL had kept outages to 
3 percent of running time in 1997 -- though this mid-day problem lasted
almost 20 minutes.  A subscriber complained about the same problem a month
earlier -- and received a response from Steve Case's office.  "We hope you
understand that we have been in a period of transition," it rationalized,
since the move to flat-rate pricing "in December 1996."
( http://www.aolwatch.org/suxlet.htm ) 

As AOL enters its 17th month of "transition", dial-up customers are now
expected to pay an additional $2.00 per month.  (Though in this month's
1800-word Community Update, Steve Case avoided any mention of the price
hike.)  At the same time, "Logging onto America Online during the day
could become more difficult," TechWeb writes, "now that the service
provider has unleashed AOL Enterprise, designed to lure employees of major
corporations onto the network between 9 and 5." 

	http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19980330S0010

Unfortunately, with an ongoing track record of problems, it may be hard
for AOL to attract businesses.  Wired News reported corporate customers
"demand comprehensive service agreements, guaranteed bandwidth and network
availability" -- and an industry analyst observed AOL "has been very bad
at that..."  ( http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/11352.html ) 
Now AOL's problems are even affecting celebrities.  Rosie O'Donnell uses
AOL for her talk show's "Interactive Mondays" -- but according to the
show's e-mail newsletter, she had to cancel the March 23 edition "due to
AOL technical difficulties." 

Even technology columnists are becoming increasingly cynical about AOL's
search for profits -- including the managing editor of ZDNet's AnchorDesk,
who wrote that "considering the lousy job it is doing being an online
access company (the service is back up after another outage...), AOL is
wise to look around for alternative revenue streams."
( http://www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/story/story_1917.html )  Chris Stamper,
a reporter for ABCNEWS.com, reacted angrily when AOL sent Tel-Save's
customers e-mail urging them to sign up their friends.  "I sent the
message to the TOS SPAM complaint department," he told AOL Watch, "along
with the rest of the day's junk mail."  Stamper had previously written
about AOL's victory against one spammer on their ten most-wanted list. 
("Does this mean Tel-Save gets that empty slot?" he asked.) 

One subscriber attempting to research the long-distance service's offer
says they received a discouraging message from AOL's software:  "We're
sorry, you do not have access to this area."  But another customer claims
they were switched to Tel-Save without being asked!  "How dare AOL take
the liberty to change MY carrier WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!!!" she wrote in
an angry e-mail to Steve Case.  "If I had WANTED to change long distance
carriers, obviously I would have done so..." 

		http://www.aolwatch.org/teleprob.htm

She soon encountered another facet of AOL's customer service.  While she
attempted to switch back to her original long-distance, Steve Case's
office refused to help her!  "America Online operates the same way a
newspaper or magazine does," his staff replied, "in that it does not have
direct control over the vendors that offer products online.  If there is a
problem with a service, the member must contact that vendor to voice their
complaint..." 

Then they gave her a phone number which returned the following message. 
"We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed..." 

A second e-mail returned a second phone number -- which also gave the same
message.  ("I hope I have been of service to you," the form letter
concluded, "and thank you for using America Online.")  In a third round of
e-mail, Steve Case's office replied that "we encourage you to look for
help online first, which in many cases will save you time....  Please let
us know if we can offer any additional assistance."  Ultimately the
subscriber located the appropriate phone number -- herself.  ("I'm sure
your reps could have found out the same information," she wrote in a
fourth e-mail, "but all you could do was pass along stupid form letters.") 

Then she cancelled her account -- after six years on AOL.  "This whole
mess has proven to me, once again, that your attitude toward customer
service comes from some archaic notion that your customers are stupid,"
she wrote in her final message -- leaving AOL with a warning.  "A service
company's reputation is made or broken upon the strength of it's customer
service department.  Apparently that little truism has not broken through
to AOL yet, and I doubt it ever will."  
( http://www.aolwatch.org/teleprob.htm ) 

There no indication if other customers had their long-distance carrier
switched -- but at least one AOL customer service representative isn't
confident.  They told AOL Watch "I will bet you lunch that they get into a
'slamming' incident with the FCC before it is over..." 

So why aren't more customers cancelling their accounts?  When speaking to
the Washington Post, AOL acknowledged a long-suspected secret:  their
phone reps issue refunds to customers who complain.  One cancelling
subscriber told AOL Watch they weren't surprised when they received a free
month -- "This is my third one!"  In fact, the refunds are apparently
offered in response to many complaints.  ("What you said about getting
FREE time because of pop up ads is true..." one AOL Watch reader confided,
"but it can also be done for ANY reason -- same result, FREE TIME...") 
They'd seen an opportunity, and planned to deliberately seek out credits.
"I am telling all my friends to tell all their friends -- and so on -- to
'cancel' AOL on April 1.  A little April Fool's joke for ol' Steve Case to
ponder..."  At least one customer service rep has told AOL Watch it wasn't
confined to April 1...  "Already people are calling up feigning being
upset, like, 'Yeah, yeah, just give me my free months!'..." 

Still, many other cancellations are legitimate.  "After almost 7 years, on
April 15th I'm pulling the plug on AOL," one AOL Watch reader wrote. 
On-line enthusiasts find better alternatives waiting.  "As a recent
graduate from America Online, your new EarthLink Network membership
affords you a real treat," reads EarthLink's "Guide for AOL Graduates" --
"true, unhindered, and FAST access to all the resources of the Internet,
access you never had as an AOL member." 

AOL users who don't want to pay the new $2.00-per-month surcharge to
continue dialing in to AOL -- an additional $24 each year -- can easily
switch to a local internet service, where they'll often find better
performance.  "Originally, AOL's network was not designed to allow access
to the much larger Internet," EarthLink's guide notes, "and so, while it
is possible now to use AOL to reach the Internet, AOL's strength remains
the content of their self-contained network." 

Earthlink has launched a "Get Out of AOL Free" campaign, waiving their  
normal $25 set-up fee for AOL refugees -- and hundreds of AOL refugees are
joining EarthLink every week!  (Ready to try a net connection? 
<A HREF="http://cgi.earthlink.net/quitaol/na/index.jhtml?RN=801703">Click Here
</A>!) 

Ironically, it's not just difficult to cancel your AOL account.  Though
AOL's Chief Operating Officer gloated that AOL's users now spend an
average of 50 minutes a day online, for some that's also non-consensual. 
Wednesday one user attempting to sign-off was told "Due to heavy traffic,
this feature is temporarily unavailable." 

"Many share your interest in this area," the warning continued.  "Please
try again later." 

Two other AOL Watch readers reported the same problem -- but with a
different message:  "Pardon the delay, this feature is temporarily closed
for maintenance or improvements."  "How in the hell would AOL perform
maintenance on the 'Close' button?" one asked.  The other subscriber
attempted to call customer service -- only to be told no operators were
available to take their call.  Repeated attempts to leave AOL returned the
same messages -- much to their chagrin. 

"The closing of AOL is one of the best features!" 

With all the customers leaving, the only people left may be AOL's on-line
"underground". Two self-identified hackers named Hex and Glaze have been
inserting their names into various pieces of AOL's content.  (Last October
they struck seven areas in one night: http://www.aolwatch.org/livehack.htm )
Now they've apparently left AOL's subscribers an Easter egg.  Clicking the
"Help & Info" button on the Member directory (located under the "Members"
menu) displays searching instructions -- but it's currently giving
subscribers a very suspicious example...

Boolean searches will "only finds profiles which contain BOTH words" the
window advises users.  Its example?  " 'Hex AND Glaze' will only find
profiles containing both 'Hex' and 'Glaze'." 

		http://www.aolwatch.org/hexsrch.gif

This latest problem is especially ironic, since AOL recently tried to beef
up security to prevent content hacks.  "Given AOL's reticence about such
matters, I wasn't surprised when no one responded to a query on this
subject," a reporter for Yahoo! Internet Life wrote. 
(http://www.zdnet.com/yil/content/depts/dblscoop/9804/ds980408.html#scoop2) 
A hacker web page offered their own analysis.  "Young teenagers easily
outsmart adults paid to work for America Online." 
( http://www.inside-aol.com/news/rmpw.htm ) 

As if that weren't enough, AOL's users report trouble with other
departments, too.  One disgruntled subscriber used their member profile to
hammer a single theme:  AOL's terms of service.  They listed their hobby
as "Trying to figure out what words and phrases are non offensive to
everyone so that I am compliant with TOS."  But even they weren't immune
to AOL's profit-seeking.  AOL tacked an advertisement onto the
subscriber's angry profile.  Its message?  "Stand out from the crowd." 

		http://www.aolwatch.org/halfjack.gif

With the ongoing litany of subscriber complaints, AOL continues to insist
they're committed to their customers.  But they've also apparently
discovered the perfect symbol for their service. 

A balloon filled with hot air.

THE LAST LAUGH

AOL's policies have even discouraged their customer service staff, to the
point where some have contacted union organizers.  It's a stark contrast
to the happy picture seen in the Washington Post, which reported "casually
dressed colleagues toss beach balls or juggle beanbags even as they field
calls." 

That may have been just for show.  One customer service staffer told AOL
Watch that "After the reporters left -- they confiscated our beach balls!"

Here's a special lil' one just in time for easter...
- cutup
----

A chicken and an egg are lying in bed. 
The chicken is smoking a cigarette with a satisfied smile on it's face
and the egg is frowning and looking a tad put out. 
The egg mutters to no-one in particular "I guess we answered THAT
question."

Tagging the Irish Center?  I would think such a shrine would
not be disgraced!  His Deadliness Himself (Deadly Buda) made
the Irish Center a place where we could enjoy a lot of good music,
dance the night away with no problem at all.  

Like my parents say to me before I leave the house:

GROW UP!

this may only be my opinion, but i felt the need to state it ((and i'll try to
make it short since its off topic))....

since i've joined this list i've seen alot of hostile and just plan rude
remarks concerning others opinions, when they are stated...well maybe its just
me but what i've always loved about this "scene" (for lack of a better name),
is that everyone is so different, but can just enjoy loud music, dancing,
etc... as one...

enough said, interpret as you will....

hoping i'm not wrong,

The Young Man's Ferrari

A hip young man goes out and buys a 1997 Ferrari GTO .  It is the best and
most expensive car available in the world, costing about $500,000. He takes it
out for a spin and while stopping for a red light, an old man on a moped (both
looking about 90 years old) pulls up next to him. The old man looks over the
sleek, shiny surface of the car and asks, "What kind of car ya' got there,
sonny?" 

The young man replies, "A 1997 Ferrari GTO. They cost about a half million
dollars!"
"That's a lot of money," says the old man, shocked.  "Why does it cost so
much?"
"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!" states the cool dude
proudly.
The moped driver asks, "Can I take a look inside?"  "Sure," replies the owner.
So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.  Leaning back on
his moped, the old man says, "That's a pretty nice car, all right!"

Just then the light changes so the guy decides to show the old man what his
car can do.  He floors it, and within 30 seconds the speedometer reads 320
mph. Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror.  It seems to be
getting closer!
He slows down to see what it could be and suddenly, whhhoooossshhh! 
Something whips by him, going much faster!  "What on earth could be going
faster than my Ferrari?!" the young man asks himself.

Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot cooming toward him.  Whoooooosh!  It goes by
again, heading the opposite direction!  And it almost looked like the old man
on the moped! "Couldn't be," thinks the guy. "How could a moped outrun a
Ferrari?!" 

Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whooooosh Ka-BbblaMMM! 
It plows into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end. The young man
jumps out, and it IS the old man!!!  Of course, the moped and the old man are
hurting for certain.  He runs up to the dying old man and says, "You're badly
hurt!  Is there anything I can do for you?" 

The old man moans and replies, "Yes,  Unhook my suspenders from your side-view
mirror!"

DIRECTIONS:
>From the Western PA/Ohio area, get to 90W towards Buffalo.
Then, follow the signs to Canada (take I-190) and use the Peace Bridge
in Buffalo to cross (using the Niagara Falls crossing will extend your trip
by 1/2 hour). PLEASE don't try to bring stupid things you're not supposed
to have with you across the border. You will get yourself and your travel 
companions in a big trouble. Once in Canada follow QEW to Toronto. Take
the Yonge Street exit there, and drive north through downtown Toronto. The 
Masonic Temple/Concert Hall is located in 888 Yonge on your left side. 

As a point of reference, the venue is located 198 miles from Erie, PA
(usually takes 
3 hours of leisurely driving [70 MPH], and in Canada the speed limit is not
strictly 
enforced, so you can go little quicker). 

If you are making an early trip to Toronto, and need a cool place to hang
out
prior to the party, go to West Queen Street (it intersects Yonge on the way
to 
the Masonic Temple - just turn left on Queen from Yonge). You can check
Speed
Records for the finest selection of Techno around, as well as many other
interesting 
clothing/food/chill-out places there, as well as meet tons of party kids on
this street.       
Not too far away is also Eastern Block - the premiere jungle/drum and bass
record 
store. Just ask someone around you who seems like they know, and they can
point 
you out to the store.

+++++++++++
We've also secured the best sound in the city as myron & cosmo return

This is for those of you who are considering going to Toronto this
Saturday for "Progress" (Adam Beyer, Cari Lekebusch, Neuromancer,
Bailey, Freaky Flow, Adam Marshall, ect) but can't make up their minds.

I went to pHryL's last party, "Clockwork" on December 20th, and these are
a few of my thoughts (N.B. This is *not* the Clockwork that is taking
place on May 24th in Columbus -- how original).

The Venue

The Masonic Temple (aka The Concert Hall) is an amazing place to have a
party.  Like most true old style Masonic Halls, the building has no
windows.  It looks like a enigmatic castle from the outside, but it has a
myriad of interweaving rooms and secret passageways on the interior. 
"Clockwork" took place on the first floor and in the basement.  Altogether
there were five rooms downstairs (including 3 chill rooms).  Then,
upstairs there was the main dance floor and a balcony above that. 
Counting the balcony which allowed you to stare down at the main dance
floor below there were 3 levels of fun.  I love parties where you can move
around and vary your experience.  As far as that goes, "Clockwork" was the
ultimate.  I hear that "Progress" will be in the same Masonic Temple, but
they are varying the rooms they are using this time to make it feel
different.  Great idea! 

The Audience

Of course, the highlight for me was getting to watch Juan Atkins spin live
for the first time.  When he came on at 2:00, there was already a sizable
crowd.  By 3:00 A.M., the entire giant main ballroom was completely full
of crazy, fun loving Ontarioans dancing madly to the Detroit techno.  I
learned later that over 1,700 people had turned up -- not bad considering
that other parties were also going on that night.  Toronto is indeed an
outstanding city to have a party!  If you've never been to a rave there
before, you should check it out.  First of all, there aren't the same
security concerns that a Chicago or Detroit or NYC party might have.
Secondly, these kids really know their music.  Perhaps this is due to the
slightly older age group (not so many teens, most in their early to mid
20's) in attendance.  Whatever the case, it was a really pleasant time.
Finally, Torontonians are really friendly.  There wasn't a frown in the
place.

The Music

With a line up that included Juan Atkins, Nigel Richards and Neuromancer
(who will also be at "Progress"), it was a sure win from the outset.  I
was pleasantly surprised by the jungle room, though.  The local Toronto
talent, which is just beginning to be appreciated in America, impressed
me.  Besides the jungle, I'm glad that pHryL is continuing their tradition
of having an experimental room for this upcoming party.  At "Clockwork", I
found it to be a wonderful alternative to the throbbing techno and driving
jungle rooms.  I came upon this space pretty much by accident.  The room
had been completely covered with colorful spraypainted images.  Inside
there were experimental sounds being played live by 4 musicians on
synthesizers all night long.  The people listening sat on the floor
against the walls digging the ambient/experimental jam.  I have to admit
that I also lost myself in the slowly evolving soundscapes that were duly
carved in the early morning hours by these guys.  It was a nice dessert to
the other musical entrees.

P.S.

If you get to Toronto on Friday, make sure you check out the club scene. 
I'll be at the Beat Junkie (on Richmond?), Area 51 and several others. 
The record stores are also pretty good.  Most of the best selection is on
Queen West.  If you're planning on going to "Progress" this weekend,
e-mail me and we might hook-up for dinner. 

Sincerely,

Braden Albert

Nope, I didn't get that, but I sure wish I did! I think it's cool as 
fuck..here's my take on the whole GBB situation, for those 
interested...:

I met Rachael a week or two ago, and she is just one of the coolest 
possible people you could ever hope to meet!  As far as I can tell, 
after everything I've seen/heard about the whole Beastie Boys 
situation, it's not her fault at all, and certainly not some evil 
ploy to scam party kids.  I will definatly be at this party, and 
supporting her in any way/shape possible!  Think about it, how many 
promoters do you know that would actually send out apologies *before* 
an event for an artist not showing?  Wait, lemme rephrase that...How 
many promoters do you know that send out apologies *at all* for 
artists not showing? :)  I think it's gunna be a bad fucking party, 
and I hope to see you all there!!

|So, here's the deal.  Please tell me if this has happened to you.
|
|I got a really neato envelope in my box today.  It was yellow and it had
|an irridescent butterfly sticker and a dot sticker butterfly and a puffy
|heart sticker on it.  Inside was this xeroxed letter that said:


Hey.  I got that.  I was going to transcribe that letter too, but I waited
for you to do it.  No, I got a white envelope sporting the winnie the pooh
theme and it was addressed to "Kids".  I looked up the address because I am
anal/nebby and it orginated from Morningside (15206), but it was postmarked
in Cleveland (uhhh huh, something's definitely up =]).  What are "Ghetto
Fabulous Pants"?  I can't resist the intimacy of the promoter (the letter),
compound that shit with all of the hype surrounding the event and I think
this automaton (me) will be attending.

Geez, come on.  Lemme rephrase..."I think it's going to be a fucking 
bad ass, awesome, unbelieveable party, and I hope to see you all

*hahahah* i thought i was bad, this easily is the most belated review of a
party EVER :)


to contribute, i was at a party at the space several months ago, and it is
dope :) nice wooden armory floors, great acoustics, fantastic women :) i
mean music :)



>Finally, Torontonians are really friendly.  There wasn't a frown in the
>place.


it sounds fake, but its *really* true :)

again, make sure you hit the queen/yonge st. area... you *cant* miss eaton
center, a mall so enormous you actually get dizzy inside...


traxx on yonge (pronounced young) st is an ok record store, play de record is 
tucked in the back of a convenience store an if u can deal with the cramped
quarters you *will* find amazing records...and they are cool about playing 
recs for you too considering the situation...its on yonge st. too, make
sure you check it..

but as far as speciality shops go, yeah speed for techno and eastern block
near yonge and bloor (2 blocks n of bloor on th left side actually :) for
drum n bass (dominik also works there so check it for some hardcore)


see you all saturday :)

im interested in hearing who is thinking about/definitely is going to this
party....roll call?



btw, t.o. (toronto ontario) is 5 hrs away from both pgh and cle. just as
far as bmore/dc and how many times have u driven there? i dont think youd
get this linup for $15 in dc thats for sure :)

o canada,
hossam

 This letter was sent to me a while back. Take it as you will! They are
basically asking for support (in the way of us calling our college/"hip" radio
stations and asking them to play their Jane's remixes, which happen to be, as
they say Break Beat and Trip Hop. Take their request as you will!!  Just
thought I would pass this along, since there are some radio people out there.

>>>Our Band/Project "DEEP RED" just remixed Jane's Addiction's new single "So
What".  Warner Brothers has serviced nationally all the major alternative
radio stations (including College radio) and many big name Dj's with CD's and
Vinyl.
 We are asking our friends in cyber land to help us make everyone aware that
these mixes exist. These are the only remixes that have ever been done for
Jane's Addiction and we feel that this is sygnificant...besides the fact that
they are excellent mixes.
 What we are asking is that everyone call their local alternative and or
college radio station request line and request that they play the remix's of
Jane's Addiction's track "So What"  by DEEP RED...ie if you live in the Bay
Area CA forinstance you could call Live 105 at 415-478-LIVE and request it
(Live 105 is already playing it so they will know exactly what your talking
about).
 Your help is very much appreciated.  If you would like information on how to
obtain a CD or Vinyl Copy of the Jane's Remixes please Contact Warner Bros. at
818-846-9090 or via the web at www.wbr.com tell them you heard it on the radio
in your area or at a club or rave and would like to know where or how to get a
copy.
 Peace...
 Mikael & Orpheos
 DEEP RED
 & the MEPHISTO Crew from SF CA
 PS It is most likeley that because they are Break Beat (the Voodoo Funk Mix),
House (Jane's House Mix) and Trip Hop (Down Tempo Addiction mix) remixes that
they will have a better chance of getting played in the evening hours since
day time programming is usually conservative playlist crap.   Feel free to
forward this letter to any friends that might be interested in calling in our
mixes of Jane's. >>

  What was that whole deal about a month ago when you were rather adamant
about saying that not only were you not promoting this event but you weren't
going to be performing there either?

What is the whole deal with this party anyway?  I haven't even seen a flyer
besides the crappy pre-flyer...I mean this is only a few days away.

All you kids that were at Spontaneous Combustion know what I'm talking 
about:

   DJ Hurricane + hip hop for 2+ hours = NO DANCING for 2+ hours

No offence, I had a lot of fun at that party, but I talked to many a 
kidd-o who were waiting for his set to end.  He's fun to watch for a 
bit, but then you want to GET FUNKY...

HEY, GBB still sounds like the bomb party...Just trying to make any of 
you out there aware of what will be going down if you're wanting to hear 
Hurricane spin...I wasn't expecting it...

I think he had said that although he would be playing there, he had 
nothing to do with actually throwing/promoting the party, and that 
was why he was upset that psychoactive was on the flyer...?

> What is the whole deal with this party anyway?  I haven't even seen a flyer

I think that was probably the actual flyer, if your talking about the 
one with the graffiti style thing on the front that was like drawn in 
pen or something..the whole thing seems way shady to me..especially 
for 30 bux....*Shrug*

I'm definitely planning on going to this party as it stands i will be in
Buffalo that day, then the plan is to get up to Toronto. I will most likely
be there. Chances are 80%, it all depends on whether or not my friends car 
can make it from Buffalo to Toronto and back. Im really hoping to see some
of you there!!! :)

	Hey all...if you get a chance before the end of the week...go too
www.muse.ie and listen to the real audio track featuring a mix by Dave
Holmes.  It's damn interesting! It includes a Japanese version of "Son of
a Preacher Man", some GhostFace Killer and other surprises too.  It's over
an hour worth of music so check it out! :)  

Hope you enjoy, :)

Now, just exactly how are they gonna house and play 50 djs?  I mean, even
if you do go and pay $25, how could you possibly hear them all?
(I credit mskw1 for his eyebrow raising question)

> * so far there are 3 rooms and a possible 4th small live pa type
> chill-out room

Still, that's 16 djs in each room with 2 left over (this is for anyone
else who can't do math).  Just how long IS this party?  How long will
their sets be?  This is sounding more and more insane with each post.
(No disrespect to the posters, it's just: my eyes are popping!)

That is all.  I'm still going.

shit. there's shoes like that in stores all over greenwich village and
soho...well they were there last april, what those places have now
probably looks likes it's from other planets. =} those places aren't cheap
but i'm sure their shoes cost somewhat less because a whole bunch of
people on our field trip bought some and we're all starving artists. some
day i want to go back with a few $100 (i went there with $50 for 4 days,
and managed to get 3 records) and spend it all on clothes from the future.
nyc is at least 2 years ahead of cities out here in cutting-edge/space-age  
fashion...oh i'd have to spend another $100 or so on records too. =D

> ps - my birthday is january 13th and i wear a size 13 :) :)

my birthday is sept 7th and i wear a size 9 1/2 (women's) =]

p.s. i got my knee surgery and my knee is lumpy and swollen and has 3
incisions (small ones at least), it looks freaky, and i have to get
another surgery and i can't dance (or do any sports) for a whole year. =o

> And you're quoting Thomas Jefferson, who supported slavery?

not to mention OWNED slaves himself. back then practically everyone with
any power or voice in this country was white men, and most of them
believed that they constituted all of humanity. anybody not white was
considered savages and more or less equivalent to animals, and women were
more or less owned by their husbands, and children by their parents. so if
you put the idea (people standing up for their rights) into context
(people equaled white men to them), you could understand what he was
thinking. but still the basic concept makes sense. civil rights are often
a "use them or lose them" situation unfortunately, because governments
many times begin to take for granted those whom they are governing.

hey:

i just came across this old link that i had (i think i got it from the
list -- but i'm sending it back).   these are some superb fonts.  they will
revolutionize the rave flyer business.  soon, every averge being will be
producing flyers for events that will never exist  -  oh what fun!  or you
can just use them...

So, I know that many of you have expressed your extreme like of the movie
"Event Horizon".  I just finished watching it; it's now 1:40am.  All I
have to say is, I don't think I'll be able to go to sleep tonight.  Oh my
gosh.  That movie was kind of scary.  I don't do so well with scary movies
I could barely make it through Friday the 13th.  In fact, I don't think I
did.  Oh my gosh.  I can't believe how scared I am now.  I think I'll have
to go to sleep with the lights on....all the lights.  I just thought
everyone would get a chuckle over brave Jenifer Foulmood losing sleep over
a little old movie.  Oh my gosh!

A few friends and myself are planning on throwing a moderatly sized party on
August 29th in the Pittsburgh area... Most of the others involved are
long-time ravers and have good (great) connections, so I'm confident it will
be a pimping party. Having said that, this is the first event I'm really
involved in, and I want to get as much information overload on the process
as possible, so I'm wondering if any of you on here who've thrown parties /
events could send me email or post some of the following information (or
point me to a faq or web page of similar)

What are some of the things often overlooked, at the last minute you're like
"Oh shit we forgot about X"...

Things to count in when calculating expenses (besides space, djs, sound,
lights, and security.)

Equipment needs (stuff like extention cords, ladder, etc...)

Info on space preparation and cleanup

Any tips, things to watch out for... etc...

Anything I didn't mention above :)

Thanks in advance for any information :)

Dan

Someone actually liked "Event Horizan"???? I thought that movie was terrible,
not the least bit scary.  And the acting was horrible!!!!!!!!  it was like a
bad rip off of Aliens.  Just my opinion.

I don't have the E-Flyer, but if you have web access, you can check out
the Phryl productions website @ www.phryl.com, and it has all the info.
Hope that helps.

Anybody else use the ICQ chat client?

Anyway, my # is 9033386 in case you wanna chat sometime.

Ok, all the people who send email from AOL need to start spelling or at
least making SOME sense.  Facestatic, Junglalien and the rest; you know
who you are!  I love reading posts but I like comprehending them even
more.

Ok, all the people who send email from AOL need to start spelling or at
least making SOME sense.  Facestatic, Junglalien and the rest; you know
who you are!  I love reading posts but I like comprehending them even
more.

THU. One more day till Friday...
Did you know that duck`s,When they Quack that it dose not Echo...
One of the great and many things..

ARIES (March 21-April 19):  
If you have to travel today, or even if you just drive around, be prepared to
hold on to your temper. It doesn't seem to be dangerous, but it sure does look
as if you're going to run into mix-ups. Even for the drive to and from work,
give yourself ample time. For you, it's a perfect day to be stuck in a traffic
jam. This may not seem very important as a forecast for you. What we're trying
to tell you is that if you're not ready for some real screw-ups, you could end
up gritting your teeth all day. Tomorrow is better for any travel.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20): 
Today's schedule is heavy on work, light on playtime. You're most concerned
about getting something important finished on time. But you should have no
trouble finding the missing pieces that held you up, Taurus. Focus on your
priority tasks today. A need to revise or correct an error that you discover
is also likely. On the whole, your most productive time will be spent on this
project today. It's very important that you take your time with it, too. Your
goal is to complete it, and not to have to go back to it again.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21):  
Here's another day when you might hear from people from your past. You still
need to be on your guard, though. This time it's people who have sensitivities
you don't even know about. It's easy to step on such toes or hurt such
feelings. Once again, you're safest among those you know best. Hey, if you
knew what we know about today's blessings on loving ties, you'd know exactly
which people to hang around today. Enjoy closeness with your loved ones and
let the rest of this crazy, mixed-up world go by.

CANCER (June 22-July 22):  
It's a mixed day today. You'll have several successes, but a long period of
boring routine could help to put you off guard. Use the time to catch up or to
develop some new ideas of your own. The secret is to stay alert for
opportunities that poke through an apparently humdrum day. You'll get more
than one chance to show your stuff, but not if you're half asleep, Moon child.
Don't buy into a pervasive feeling that not much more is going to happen on a
routine day like this.

LEO (July 23-August 22): 
Either somebody sugar coats a situation for you today, or you're putting that
kind of spin on things yourself. A deceptive trend now isn't necessarily dark
and dangerous. It's just likely to help you put your head higher in the
clouds. That's what could be dangerous, Leo. Make a reality check when you
find yourself overly enthusiastic about any nebulous plan. Nevertheless, it's
a remarkable day for creative thinking and creative work. Go ahead and have
some fun with it.

VIRGO (August 23-September 22):
Today is a good day for the kind of work you do best. Attack budgets, records,
proposals, and anything else that involves meticulous detail. The best route
of all is to deal with financial record-keeping (and financial planning, too).
The energy will apply to both your work and your personal affairs. Be careful
though, Virgo. It's best to just work on ideas. Spending your hard-earned cash
is a another matter entirely. But you may find it easy to work out a plan to
pay off an outstanding debt now.

LIBRA (September 23-October 22): 
Your thoughts today are probably more focused on romantic notions than on your
work. You'll need to get a grip on that, Libra. Love is supposed to enhance
your life, not wreck it all to pieces. You're past the danger of any serious
errors in the work you do, but that doesn't mean you can't still produce some
little messes if you aren't careful. Save all those dreamy thoughts for the
proper time. That's after work, Libra. Time spent then with either friends or
your sweetie will warm your heart.

SCORPIO (October 23-November 21):
It's funny how it always works this way. Just as you begin to feel perfectly
satisfied with your financial situation, new ideas about adding to your income
start popping in your head. Don't allow complacency to help you minimize their
worth, Scorp. Explore those possibilities. Your regular work goes
exceptionally well today, too. Keep up this pace, and you'll soon be freer to
indulge in the work you love best. Some of you call it a hobby, but we know
all about your idea of relaxing. 

SAGITTARIUS (November 22- December 21): 
It's important to follow up on promises and obligations today. Disappointing
someone who counted on you could lead to repercussions later. Pay special
attention to what's expected of you by subordinates and children. This looks
like you're the one who's supposed to come through and take action. If you
don't, you may lose more than respect. You may lose the trust of people who
matter to you. Don't look for an earth-shaking crisis either, Sag. This whole
thing comes up in a subtle way that you may deem unimportant.

CAPRICORN (December 22-January 19): 
Make it your business to complete some work today that was held over. Put off
new stuff for now. Your powers of concentration seem to have taken a vacation,
Cappy. That's why it's best to work at something that's already been developed
and checked out. It's the kind of day when you could find yourself taking the
wrong exit on the expressway or misplacing the very thing you need to take
along with you. You may not be as able as usual to concentrate on details, but
you're sure likely to be preoccupied.

AQUARIUS (January 20-February 18):
You may hear from someone from your past today. Bet you're trying to guess
who, huh? That won't do you any good -- this is a real surprise. Today's best
work revolves around mental activity and new ideas. It's time to let go of
some old ideas and attitudes that don't work anymore. The first step is to
admit they weren't workable at all. We know it's hard for you to give up on
the products of your own mind. But you know, first you can be impulsive, and
then you can get stubborn about your own impulsiveness. Odd, huh?

PISCES (February 19-March 20): 
It's not a day to force issues, Pisces. That could also include a warning
about revealing ideas or plans too soon. Nevertheless, it's a good day. You'll
be most productive by working away quietly and keeping to your own schedule.
Just because there won't be any pizzazz doesn't mean you aren't getting ahead.
The pizzazz comes later, when the record of your reliability holds up under
scrutiny. Found money is possible today. You know, you discover a check you
didn't deposit or a bill you've already paid.

whose skills are known only those in the overworld.
Making a P.A. will be experimentalists L.P.N.
featuring ED-UM and 666 AUDIO and a long awaited
appearance from OMBIENSE who haven't been seen
since their P.A. at Trancednece 3-1/2 years ago!

Well people,
                        I just received word from Jungle Sky that the full
interview with me in Florida as well as THE NEW VIDEO will air this weekend
on AMP. So set those VCRs. I will need one of you to make a copy for me
because I don't have cable nor do I have a TV at the moment. Also as far as
the big news I'm going to announce June 1st, I'm sorry but I cannot
disclose that at the present time so y'all can stop emailing me. I'll just
say this, you'll read about it in Mixmag US, possibly URB as well and you
may see a mention of it in the New York Times. Additionally, talks are
underway for an interview on MTV News about it. If you needed a hint lets
just say it is of a personal nature which will be of interest to alot of
people andmy cut my dreads off has something to do with it but that was
just the beginning. You'll hear it here first as I plan to make the
announcement here a day before everywhere else.

I picked this up off another mailing list, it blew my mind...Not 
really rave related, but still.....damn!

-----

This story came from the  "Daily Texan" - the University of Texas
newspaper.Apparently it occurred during Fall Premier-a UT tradition 
that is a celebration of the end of midterms. "Reason to not party 
anymore"-This guy went out last Saturday night to a party.  He was 
having a good time, had a couple of beers and some girl seemed to 
like him and invited him to go to another party.  He quickly agreed 
and decided to go along with her. She took him to a party in some 
apartment and they continued to drink, and even got involved with 
some other drugs (unknown which). The nextthing he knew, he woke
up completely naked in a bathtub filled with ice.  He was still 
feeling the effects of the drugs, but looked around to see he 
was alone. He looked down at his chest, which had "CALL 911 OR YOU 
WILL DIE" written on it in lipstick. He saw a phone was on a stand 
next to the tub, so he picked it up and dialed. He explained to the 
EMS operator what the situation was and that he didn't know
where he was, what he took, or why he was really calling.  She advised
him to get out of the tub. He did, and she asked him to look himself 
over in the mirror. He did, and appeared normal, so she told him to 
check  his back. He did, only to find two 9 inch slits on his lower 
back. She told him to get back in the tub immediately, and they sent 
a rescue team over.

Apparently, after being examined, he found out more of what
had happened. His kidneys were stolen. They are worth 10,000
dollars each on the black market. (I was unaware this even
existed.) Several guesses are in order: The second party was a sham,
the people involved had to be at least medical students, and it was 
not just recreational drugs he was given. Regardless, he is currently 
in the hospital on life support, awaiting a spare kidney.
 
The University of Texas in conjunction with Baylor University Medical 
Centre is conducting tissue research to match the sophomore student 
with a donor. I wish to warn you about a new crime ring that is 
targeting business travellers. This ring is well organized, well 
funded, has very skilled personnel, and is currently in most major 
cities and recently very active in New Orleans. The crime begins when 
a business traveller goes to a lounge for a drink at the end of the 
work day.  A person in the bar walks up as they sit alone and offers 
to buy them a drink. The last thing the traveller remembers until 
they wake up in a hotel room bath tub, their body submerged to their 
neck in ice, is sipping that drink. There is a note taped to th ewall 
instructing them not to move and to call 911.  A phone is on a small 
table next to the bathtub for them to call. The business traveller 
calls 911 who have become quite familiar with this crime.  The 
business traveller is instructedby the 911 operator to very slowly 
and carefully reach behind them and feel if there is a tube 
protruding from their lower back.  The business traveller finds the  
tube and answers, "Yes."  The 911 operator tells them to remain 
still, having already sent paramedics to help. The operator knows 
that both of the business traveller's kidneys have been harvested.

This is not a scam or out of a science fiction novel, it is real. It
is documented and confirmable.  If you travel or someone close to you
travels, please be careful. Sadly, this is very true.  My husband is 
a Houston Fire- fighter/EMT and they have received alerts regarding 
this crime ring. It is to be taken very seriously. The daughter of a 
friend of a fellow fire-fighter had this happen to her.  Skilled 
doctor's are performing these crimes! (which, by the way have been 
highly noted in the Las Vegas area). Additionally, the military has 
received alerts regarding this. This story blew me away. I
really want as many people to see this as possible so please bounce
this to whoever you can. MicheleShafer - DML/Lab Administration

Ah yes, the famous 'kidney harvesting' story.  The version of it I got two
years ago was about a business man in New Orleans who had 'something slipped to
him in a drink' -- and the rest is history.  Same bathtub, same message.  And
when I heard the story back then, I actually believed it.  Anyone who's
interested can find that exact same (not exact, but a version) story on the
Urban Legends Homepage -- as it is, indeed, an urban legend.  It is a very
cool, creepy story, though.

Woah! How did i miss this one?  Sounds incredible!  Who are QPG and MB?
I'm guessing the Sessions kru has something to do with this?  Anyone with
more background email me.  I'd be very willing to help out if needbe.
Is the bus meant to pay for the thing, or is it just coz there's limited
parking?  Also another Q:  What's Artificial Gravity?  I haven't had time
or a good enough signal to listen to Radio Carson - do they do shows now?

I'm beaming over this one! :)

And another thing:  Just wanted to give 187 some public props for his
tunes on the new Jungle Sky comp (Rock & Roll).  I just got a copy the
other day!  If you get a chance folks check out "The Return of Shaft" -
this one rocks you 187 stylee like none before!!   Its the closest
translation of his live PA to a tune that i'v heard, and i mean that in a
good way.  Respect!

actually, its the people who put on the after hours for cheer.  the main
figure is link (as in mod squad), who is a bartender at zythos.  i could
have him call you if you want.  

as far as the bus goes, its cause there's not really any parking.  the
money is for the bus, the party is free.  link just wants people to get
together in the afternoon for fun in the sun.

that post, i think it was from ben on the mw list, about record boxes he
was making, made me realize i need cases or a case for my turntables and
mixer, but the only ones i ever see in catalogs are icky grey-carpeted
ones. i want one or three (depending on what size) made out of treadplate
because they would last forever and be waterproof (well maybe i'd have to
put in gaskets), not to mention WAY stylee. =D anyway where can i get
cases like this? a coffin case would be ok if it had wheels on the corner,
for transportation. otherwise i would need 2 turntable cases and 1 for a
19" mixer. and ben i forgot to ask how much are those boxes are.

If you've got a spare day or even a few hours, I'd hit your local Guitar
Center or Sam Ash.

They've got some NICE coffins, and other nice little toys. Well worth the
trip and time. :)

DON'T order from upstairs!  They're shady as hell.  I've had experience
with them being shady and I've talked to people in the past year or two
that have told me shady stories.  If you want an online ordering place
www.pssl.com is really cool and they'll even work out discounts.
My first 1210 turntable came from upstairs 5 years ago, but I hear
they're still shady.  They take advantage of the fact your not in NY to
go to the actual store.

Sorry , I read the post out of order and missed the initial question.  I
got my coffin at www.pssl.com they have a really good selection and nice
prices.  Guitar center has a few styles too.  
Also I'd recommend getingg the individual cases.  It's much easier to
transport if you have a normal sized car.  My coffin weighs a ton! 
Everyone hates moving it, plus it dosn't fit well in my car.

Has anyone ever tried to make their own turntable case?  cause they cost
a good bit of $$ (anywhere from $90-300) and it seems like a pretty
simple design . . . but on the other hand . . ..  .

i'm sending this to both lists, because i don't remember who is on what
one and it's rave relevant, and might be of interest to other DJs.

yeah i saw that. (they finally sent my catalog after like 2 months) but
it's plastic (not as durable as metal), + i don't really like the way it
looks, all bumpy and i think it has that fake leather-texture. but the
wheels are such a basic idea i would have thought it had been implemented
a long time.

but then, unless you have 3 arms (you could do a lot more tricks that
way), you've got to balance your mixer on your head to carry it. ;) i know
mine would fall off and break. i've carried my old mixer in my backpack
before because it fit and i was only going across the street, but my new
one is really thick, and the sliders would come off of it. 3 small cases
cost more than 1 big case too. but i think i'll get a coffin, even though
it might have to be custom made in metal, with wheels.

i play both, usually techno though, and my tonearms are always at the
back. when they're on the side, they get in the way and i bump them and
fuck up the set. =o you can still reach the pitch control since it's
under the tonearm, and power, start/stop, 33, and 45 are in front of you
still. but if somebody really wants them turned around i'd just take it
all out of the case.

ARIES (March 21-April 19):  
Okay, you'll have a much easier time on the go today. It's also a great day
for organizing your thoughts and planning your next move. Planning work of any
kind will go well, but the real focus is on planning for your own success and
well-being. For some of you, those plans may include making your current
romance a permanent relationship. Even if that's not the case, Aries, look
forward to some good times in the heartthrob department as the day goes on.
Some of you may receive an invitation to a social event.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20): 
Finish the work week with any leftover tasks or assignments. That project you
worked on yesterday is near enough to completion now to wrap it up this week.
The weekend will be good for travel or a quick getaway. You feel an urge to
expand your horizons, Taurus. Don't overlook the possibility that a new
intellectual interest can do that for you, too. Some of you have felt that
you've been in a jar lately, anyway. Now's the time to break loose and explore
the world around you.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21):  
You move into another period of popularity. That should help ease the feeling
that you've been walking on eggs around others lately. You may get a
surprising or last-minute invitation. Accept it. It'll be fun, and it seems to
offer you some sort of personal advantage. That element of surprise is strong
in your forecast now. Before the day is out, you should experience a
pleasurable and unexpected event. Today should make up for the less pleasant
days you may have had earlier this week.

CANCER (June 22-July 22):  
This could be the best day in an up-and-down week. You get a chance to use
your smarts and show your stuff. An influence that helps you deal with
difficulties diplomatically teams up with a surge of impressive initiative. To
you, it's a matter of handling what needs to be handled. To observers, it's a
new insight into your potential for leadership. Today could make up for all
the uncomfortable stress of the preceding week. Face it with supreme
confidence, Cancer, and be ready to take action.

LEO (July 23-August 22): 
While you're making your plans for some social activities or even a short
trip, keep this in mind. It's an excellent time for you to network about your
ideas. Look for opportunities to do that today and through the weekend, Leo.
Romance continues to thrive, unless you lost your head and resorted to cave-
man tactics. Yes, even a lioness can come on too strong. Don't let that little
remark stop you, though. This is indeed the time to enjoy your love life.
We're just warning you about scaring anyone off.

VIRGO (August 23-September 22):
Finish your week, Virgo, but look forward to the weekend, too. It'll be a fine
time for just enjoying yourself. You may want to make some calls today to get
things going. Tickets for a special event, or reservations for a family outing
are in order. There's a tendency here to be overly generous to those you love.
It isn't dangerous enough to warn you against planning a good time. Just talk
yourself out of any notion that you have to go first class. Get prepared for a
little romance this weekend, too.

LIBRA (September 23-October 22): 
It's been really hard to get your attention this week, Libra. Yeah, we know
what you're thinking about. So okay already, it's another fine, fine day for
romance. However, it's also a day to avoid mixing romance with business. And
if you just happened to fall in love with someone on the job, be careful today
not to let that blossoming relationship cause any trouble there. If you've
been really wise, the two of you have managed to keep the whole thing pretty
quiet, anyway. Still, keep your mind on your work.

SCORPIO (October 23-November 21):
This is a good day to visit your bank or talk to a financial advisor. Now that
finances are increasing, you could use some help in making the most of the
trend. The day is filled with satisfaction for you in other ways. What you
manage to accomplish now makes up for that awful, get-nowhere day you had
earlier this week. You end up today ready to exercise that special ability --
walking away from one thing and throwing yourself completely into its
opposite. Yep, it promises to be a big, fun night for you.

SAGITTARIUS (November 22- December 21): 
Take the lead today in resolving business matters. You'll probably end up
calling this one of your luckier days if you do. It's a favorable time to
engage in investments and speculation. Heck, go ahead and buy a lottery
ticket, just for kicks. You're in a pretty good mood, and you're ready to
enjoy yourself after work. Still, a situation may arise at home that needs
some handling. Use the energy that's been with you all day to resolve it. That
means dealing with it in an upbeat fashion. Don't make a federal case of small
things.

CAPRICORN (December 22-January 19): 
Well, thank heaven. Your energies are up again. That old go-get-'em Cappy
attitude is back in place, too. Look forward to a profitable and pleasing day
because of it. This is a great day to clean up outstanding projects once and
for all and get started on new ones. We could, in fact, warn you about being
too impulsive, but we trust your Capricorn good sense. Find a way to use that
good energy in your pleasure pursuits today, too. Touch football on the lawn
is good. Dating is good. (Wink-wink.)

AQUARIUS (January 20-February 18):
Popularity reigns supreme. It's nothing new to you, just another day when
you're set to reap the benefits of it. Some interesting opportunities to
circulate should be coming along now. Surprisingly, you may be planning a big
party of your own. But it's not the usual spontaneous gathering of friends at
your house. This one has you exerting real effort to "make things nice." Some
of you will spend much time today on those plans. Physical labor is involved
here too, somehow. 

PISCES (February 19-March 20): 
Now then, here's the day when you can flaunt your best ideas and suggestions
to an appreciative audience. It's a day to take action in your own behalf,
Pisces. Step into the open and refuse to be shy about your capabilities.
Tonight is heavily romantic. Heck, the whole day is romantic. We're just
trying to follow a reasonable timetable here, Pisces. Heaven forbid that all
this lovey-dovey energy should seize upon you in public. It spills over into
tomorrow, too.

Well hello out there in T.V. land!!  Has anyone else seen the new 187
video??!  Hmmm?  Well, if you did, then you know it's wonderful.  If you
didn't, you should be kicking yourself in the pants right now and cursing
the day you ever chose not to have cable.  Moving along, the video is
quite disturbing.  I mean, I've seen some civil rights footage in my day,
but not like this...not all at one big old blast in the kisser.  This
video is so damn good, I have a problem watching it (that's how disturbing
it is, it's just so violent).  Being the privledged princess that I am,
I've already seen the original cut and I can tell the common masses that
we did not get to see some of the most brilliant parts because they cut
the last minute and a half or so.  Perhaps, if you're all well-behaved, we
may organize a SPECIAL pb-cle viewing party with the FULL and EXPOSED
director's cut.  Only if you're good.

Her Imperial Highness, 
Lady Foulmood

ARIES (March 21-April 19):  
Here's another top-dollar day for love and romance, Aries. Make sure you
schedule some private moments to take the best advantage of it. Actually, it's
a positive day for you all across the board. You could wake up sort of grumpy,
but that'll pass. Get a good breakfast, and the sluggishness will go away.
While you'll probably enjoy yourself socially today, too, there's something
you need to remember. You've learned a lot about whom you can trust and whom
you can't. Be careful not to repeat any of those mistakes now.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20): 
Spend at least part of the day with your favorite someone. The astrological
climate promises you a special feeling of closeness and some carefree fun
together. Even a small disagreement that might turn up won't spoil that, Venus
child. Put work aside for the time being. And you certainly don't want to
waste this glorious day stewing over bothersome things about your job, do you?
>From now into the early part of next week, you need to relax so that the
problems you perceive can shrink down to a manageable size.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21):  
People are very willing to help you and support your goals today. You may run
into a business contact socially and make more headway than you've made all
week. Come right out and ask for any help you need, Gem. You should get a good
reception for your requests today. Close ties are eager to please you.
Business associates are willing to cooperate. For some of you, this will all
work out at a social event of some kind that's connected to your work or
career.

CANCER (June 22-July 22):  
Romantic blessings insinuate themselves into a week completely devoted to your
responsibilities. Draw a heart around the day on your calendar and get ready,
Moon child. Depending on your current situation, a number of things could
happen today. Some of you may tumble head over heels in love. Others will find
the climate warm and wonderful for pursuing memorable private moments with a
partner. It's up to you to decide whether you need to be out there ready for a
new event, or wrapped up in privacy at home.

LEO (July 23-August 22): 
Contacts made at social functions this weekend are especially favorable for
the self-employed. That new person you meet now may turn out to be your newest
client later on. It's hardly necessary to tell you to be at your best. You're
so charged up with positive energy, it'd be hard to do anything else. But
here's a tip: Don't expect the most important encounters of the weekend to
take place only at parties and gala events. Keep your eyes and ears open in
the most routine of places, too, Leo.

VIRGO (August 23-September 22):
Here's a day with enormous potential for having fun. Family activities are
highlighted, and (maybe for a change) the kids are easy to please. That's
partly because your own mood just delights them. You didn't know that, did
you, Virgo? Get involved in the kind of activity best suited to your romantic
needs, too. Couples should relax and have fun together if they hope for
private special events later on. Virgos still looking for love should make
sure they're out in circulation today.

LIBRA (September 23-October 22): 
This is a great day for planning and executing changes on the home front.
Those of you contemplating marriage or live-in arrangements can succeed with
negotiating the necessary adjustments together. The rest of you can have a
wonderful time just working on making the household more comfortable and
functional. Beauty in your surroundings is always a key factor in your own
sense of well being. Sooo, Libra, there might also be a few important matters
of different tastes to work out here.

SCORPIO (October 23-November 21):
The weekend may bring unexpected guests to your door. It's just as likely that
you'll want to celebrate the breezier sense of springtime by staging a little
party. Many people never guess that you love to entertain. Well, okay, you
love to entertain on your own terms. Work up one of your easy-to-do menus and
put on that "I'm relaxed, you be relaxed" air you have about you. Your idea is
that the party should be informal and apparently effortless. Yeah, and how
much effort does that take beforehand, Scorp?

SAGITTARIUS (November 22- December 21): 
It's a good day for entertaining at home. On the other hand, you and your mate
may also enjoy treating some others to dinner out, or to a cultural event.
Either way, the treat's on you, Sag. You could make a major purchase for the
home today, after putting it off for some time. If something like that is on
your agenda, you'll find your money's worth -- maybe even a bargain -- today.

CAPRICORN (December 22-January 19): 
Here's another good day for you, Cappy. It's not a perfect one, but pretty
good. You may have to settle some disagreement at home or deal with a
cantankerous child. But you can also take care of personal business and
errands to your great satisfaction. Singles get good influences for starting
off on a weekend getaway, and couples should consider that little pleasure,
too. Really, almost anything you've planned for your own pleasure works out
very well. Enjoy the day.

AQUARIUS (January 20-February 18):
Your usual interest in group activities is overshadowed today. The much more
promising way to spend your time is in a private little tete-a-tete. That
comes later though, after a day when you manage to pack in a variety of
errands and things to do. Early hours may see an argument between you and a
close tie. No, no, no -- not a lover. Nothing's going to spoil that today,
Aquarius. Anyway, you can diffuse that little disagreement easily by just
listening to what the other has to say.

PISCES (February 19-March 20): 
It's a good day for partying with friends. Have some people over tonight, why
don't you? Some Pisceans may meet a new romantic interest today. The rest of
you, the ones who've already been smitten, know from yesterday's hint what you
ought to do with today. Do you want to eliminate anything less pleasant from
today's agenda? Don't -- repeat, don't -- bring up a discussion about money.
And run and hide in your room if anyone else brings it up.

Is there anything going on tonight in the Cleveland area (aside from 420)
worth checking out?

So where is it going to be? I just tried the infoline

It would be spam if I was selling something. I'm not selling anything. 
By listing all the lists that this message is sent to I'm letting the
DJs and the listeners know how far of contact they got.  I've already
got Dj's form Colorado and San Fransico sending me tapes to play since
they can't make it.  I keep telling everyone, this is free promotion for
YOU!  This is getting your names and your sound out to people who want
to hear it.  This connects the DJs to the promotors,  all over the US. 
I'm not making anything off of this.  I had to put up with all my
neighbors complaining and the cops showing up.  Most of the ravers are
only on one or two of the lists.  They see the message, they see who all
is receiveing this message, and they see that people all over the place
are getting this.  It pulls them here to hear YOU.  My site isnt hugh, I
have no banners! I have to use that third party counter right now until
my server supports cgi.  I though I was helping to bring this scene
closer together.  I still don't see how it's spam.

If you are going to toronta I hear that a place called area 51 is the shit

How waz 4:20 i think it would stink realy bad being at  trilogy i think that
they should of held it d-z the discovery Zone Hell Ya!!

ARIES (March 21-April 19):  
Time spent with friends is pleasant for you, and you'll probably bask in the
special support you get today. Today is a good day to mull over a problem
you're having with a boss or other authority figure. You may feel you're
getting nowhere fast in that situation. Maybe you just need to rethink your
approach. Challenging a decision won't get you the reasons you're asking for.
And you may really need to hear those reasons to understand. Plan ahead for
the next encounter and find a better way to handle it.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20): 
It's a good to find your activities around the house. If you must travel, be
prepared for some delay in getting there. You may be puzzling over a matter
that concerns your sense of professionalism and right actions. Think if over
if you must, but don't dwell on it. Remember? We've already told you that you
need to get your mind off serious issues and have yourself a little fun.
You'll see -- the time you take to unwind this weekend will help you restore a
more positive outlook about things that trouble you.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21):  
Spending a quiet and peaceful day at home will be more satisfying than any
other activity. Inspirational reading and music will go a long way toward
satisfying today's mood. Powerful insights are possible, Gem, if you make the
time for reflective thought. More importantly, that's the activity needed to
nourish the spiritual side of you now. This is the side of you that not many
people get to see. It's the side of you that needs nourishment from time to
time, too.

CANCER (June 22-July 22):  
Little things could threaten your usual Sunday routine, Cancer. Try to bear
some minor frustrations that start off your day. It'll get better. Look at a
forced change in some of your plans as a chance to improve on them. And try to
be sensitive to the feelings of your loved ones when things go awry. Later,
you can almost feel yourself becoming more alert. That's because your
intuition perks up and gives you a sharper focus. Pay attention to hunches and
special insights now.

LEO (July 23-August 22): 
Are you finding it a little hard to get going this morning? That's the effect
of all that excitement you've been having lately. A new work week is coming up
soon, Leo. You'll need to be back in good shape by tomorrow, pal. Things are
due to start picking up speed there. Maybe it's time to review your diet or
increase your exercise. Not in the mood for that? Well, okay, but at least do
something to help yourself recover from the indulgences of the weekend. How
about an ice pack?

VIRGO (August 23-September 22):
Today is a quieter day, and one suited to solving problems. Just don't be
discouraged about things that come up for your attention, Virgo. You're able
to deal with almost anything. By the end of the day, you should be feeling
pretty good about how you've handled things. If you've played the weekend
right so far, yesterday you were able to relax and enjoy yourself. Today,
you'll do best if you follow that up with some extra quiet and rest. Tonight
is not a time to engage in ambitious projects. Put your feet up and relax.

LIBRA (September 23-October 22): 
Make the most of a rather difficult day. Plans may go awry, especially your
own plans for spending time with a certain someone. You'll knock yourself way
off kilter if you insist on making a big deal about it. This isn't the time to
entertain doubts about a relationship just because other matters have
intervened today. Just chalk it all up to one of those rare days when you
don't feel in sync with the universe, and try to find something to take your
mind off some silly notions.

SCORPIO (October 23-November 21):
Hang around some older and wiser people today. You're in the mood to enjoy
their reveries and soak up their advice. You're probably in the mood for one
of those secret family recipes, too. People would be amazed to see your
patience with cranky complaints and sour comments on the state of the world.
You'll run into some of that today for sure, but your reverence for experience
and lives lived well makes you tolerate that kind of thing with gentle
amusement. Treat yourself to a favorite pastime, Scorp.

SAGITTARIUS (November 22- December 21): 
Yesterday's luck with shopping doesn't extend into today, Sag. You'll need to
wait nearly a week now if you didn't take advantage of it. This may sound
silly, but you may overreact to a situation with embarrassment. Don't let
yourself feel that way. Even a real goof-up isn't any threat to your standing.
Cultural interests continue to be your best bet for recreation. Even pop
culture works. Movie buffs should indulge themselves with a marathon of the
latest or their favorite films. 

CAPRICORN (December 22-January 19): 
Dig into some tantalizing projects today, especially ones that tax your mind.
You'll enjoy that, Cappy, if you see it as a big puzzle to solve. Today's mood
is less focused on entertainment and more focused on getting something useful
accomplished. There may be obstacles to that, but you can handle it. And even
though yesterday held its little romantic joys, there's much more to come next
week. That's why we're suggesting that you get caught up with some work today.
You don't want to miss what's coming.

AQUARIUS (January 20-February 18):
You're going to make this day hard on yourself if you go back to worrying and
fretting about recent events. Keep it up, and you'll be afraid to move
forward, Aquarius. Instead of focusing your present meditative mood on the
negative, turn those powers toward seeking positive insights. Inspirational
conversations, reading, or simple reflection on your real values and goals
should help you out here. Spend some time with a wise and trusted friend, too,
and take the advice you get to heart.

PISCES (February 19-March 20): 
Hey! You aren't going to sink back into worrying in the middle of a weekend
like this, are you? Why don't you just continue enjoying yourself? Today's a
good day to get in touch with people by phone. Have a long talk with a close
buddy, or call up the family and talk to every single person who's home.
Remember that the most pleasure this weekend comes from getting together with
friends. Okay, maybe not the most pleasure. You know what the most pleasure
comes from.

what up yall', i just got home from 420 and i had a bomb ass time. i was
really doubting it before i went, but they really pulled it off. i caught a
great vibe and ran into some charma on the way. at about 4am i was chillin at
the top of trilogy behind the couches with some kids, and i took my wallet out
for something but evidently forgot to put it back in my pants. about an hour
later and on the other side of the spot i realized i lost my walet and started
trippin out, i had $200 dollars cash and some other important necessities in
it. i run back to the couch area and there is a different group of kids there,
and i'm like "yo,have any of you seen a wallet", expecting a short and
negative reply. however the kids shine there light and find my innocent wallet
lying right next to my lighter i apparently left too. everything was intact.
much love out to that cinci crew who found it, you know who you are. but the
cool thing was that the kid who found it, reminded me that it is pretty phat
to have a scene in cleveland where i can leave a wallet at a party for an hour
and come back and get it, it really makes you feel good. so basically the
party was phat, and the kids were all down as they should be.
much love to rakim-nice show! and sleepy c-you really did surprise some kids,
you went off yo, well done!
-merely an honest review from a happy customer.
peace- max

ignore....i made a million friends, i was on Cloud 9 all night...i talked to
alot of people...and danced for all i was worth... :)...but i was glad to hear

All I have to say is this party was the best party I have been to in a really
long time!!!  The main reason I went was because of the swedes, but I had the
time of my life!!!  The Toronto scene is the vibeiest scene i have ever
witnessed. I went with one other person to a strange city, and ended up making
a whole bunch of new friends.  Of course the music was Fucking AMAZING!!!!!!!
Cari lekebusch is as good a Dj as he is a producer.  Adam Beyer was also
amazing, as well as Neuromancer, but i have to say the suprise of the night
was the 6:00am set of ADAM MARSHALL. It has been a while since I have heard
this guy, but his set of slow, deep ass techno blew me away.  I couldn't pull
myself off the speaker!!!  All in all, I had a great time and plan on going to
more Toronto events in the future(and Viktor, you still owe me 10. heheheeee)

Just out of curiousity, has anyone ever heard DJ Jazzy Jeff spin?  Has
anyone every heard Afrika Bambata?  Derrick Carter?  Terry Mullan?
Plus five more.  All in the same spot at the same party?  There's this
party in Detroit called Tight 2: Tighter...on May 2nd.  Given a choice
between Gbb and a party such as this one, which would you pick?  Just out
of curiousity.

JEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  These guys are GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!! 

DJ Jazzy Jeff...............most people associate him with his time while he
was "working" for Will Smith!  BUT......he's no chessy DJ.  If you ever get to
see him spin he is really GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   He was spinning in a DMC
compettion a few years ago.  All he had was 2 of the same record.  He walked
up on stage, and started one.  Now they were both recordings of some New Age
song.  It started off with these really light rain drops.  What he did
was.....he'd let you hear one rain drop........wait a few seconds, cut the
record over and play the other rain drop on the other record.   He did this
and honestly...........it was one of the TOUGHEST build-ups I ever heard.
.....Drip .....Drip.....Drip drip........Over and over ...faster and faster.
I mean he took it to the extreme!    Then he just
stopped.........and.......POW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thunder hit and he just walked
off stage!   He's the only DJ I ever heard that could make rain:-)  

Afrika Bambata........they're old skool.....very old skool;)  All the breakers
should appreciate them:-)  

Terry Mullan is good too!!!!!!!!   

My 2 cents
Jason

yeah i like it when a hip-hop dj plays with two copies of the
same record.  that's a lot of fun and a good way to showcase the skills.

i've been listening to a show we have on my college radio station 92.1
every friday night.  i never knew his name until a few days ago but the dj
there goes by "black steel" and he's pretty good - tho his name doesn't
get around a lot.  old school + new school selections and no puffies.

i've also been listening to the other local college radio in pittsburgh
(88.3) for the past couple hours ... some delicious trance has been going
on, altho the record playing now is kinda like hard house.  oh.  now it's
the spin spin suga song.  

also i think terry mullan had a gig at chameleon in pittsburgh tonight.

blah blah blah.  

i feel you 
david

I still think the D-z iz a Great Idea..Or The I-x Center

Your horoscope for Monday, April 20, 1998

ARIES (March 21-April 19):  
You and a partner differ widely about the use of funds now, Aries. Try not to
push it today. Brand new energy affecting your financial judgment will
encourage you to do just that. Just think twice before you head off on an urge
to make new investments or crack open that nest egg. You'll be on this kick
for some time, and you won't always be wrong about it. Today, when the
influence is new and powerful, keep a level head about impulsive expenditures.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20): 
Today you enter a period that focuses on your inner concerns, knowledge, and
goals. There's a danger that issues of anger you haven't resolved may blow up
in your face. Get to the bottom of any impulses you feel to blow your stack at
someone. We're talking about any anger or resentment you've suppressed for too
long, Taurus. No, we aren't recommending that you go ahead and explode with it
now. What we're recommending is that you manage it better by understanding its
inner causes. Chill.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21):  
You'll find that the time you spend with close ties today will result in new
inspirations. Try not to talk yourself into believing you're too busy to
indulge friends who want your company. It's an ideal day for planning a
business trip that includes fun. Well, you're calling it a business trip, but
your Gemini eyes are on the possibilities for getting together with people you
like. Oh, you'll learn a lot, all right. But once again, the real benefit is
what you can absorb from unscheduled gabfests. Go ahead and make your plans,
Gem.

CANCER (June 22-July 22):  
You're facing a mixed week, Moon child, so hold on to the fact that its real
outcome is progress. Today is good for meetings and talks, but not so good for
dealing with personal finances. In that regard, it'd be better to postpone any
discussions with loved ones about money. See what we meant by a mixed week?
You can make great gains in discussions about work, but you can end up in an
argument if you talk dollar signs to friends. The day also holds an element of
surprise for your personal life.

LEO (July 23-August 22): 
There's a potential for an argument today, and it'll be the fault of both of
you if it happens. You'd be wise to back off as soon as you read the signals
that a discussion won't go well. In spite of this very real potential for
stress, the day is a good one for you, Leo. And there's plenty of energy to
enable you to enjoy your favorite pastime. Yeah, we mean romance. Someone may
give you a small gift that pleases you greatly or do you a favor that's just
as pleasing. What gets to your heart is the thoughtfulness behind it.

VIRGO (August 23-September 22):
Take a last look at your finances before you move ahead, Virgo. It's a good
day to make some moves to help yourself function more efficiently.
Redistributing the money you keep in several accounts, for example, is one way
you might manage money better. Considering ways to reduce debt more easily is
another. The workday goes well enough to allow you to take some time with
these matters. And -- you won't want to believe this -- there's something
you're not seeing that could improve your financial situation.

LIBRA (September 23-October 22): 
Your usual diplomatic skill may fail you today if you ignore signals from
others. Not everyone you run into is in a good mood. Even your most gracious
approaches could set someone off. Yes, it is rather disconcerting, but you
need to understand that you can't always turn the battleground into a peace
garden, Libra. Take it in stride and move on. The last thing you need now is
to convince yourself that you're some kind of failure because of someone
else's mood. 

SCORPIO (October 23-November 21):
Sooner than you expected, the end of a Mercury-retrograde motion clears away a
cloud of confusion. You not only understand what you have to do, but you know
just how to do it. It's a good day to sign contracts and finalize agreements
that were part of that cloud, Scorp. Some of you are forming new partnerships
in business or career. You can safely complete purchases you kept on hold,
too. Not only is it a day for increased activity for you, it's a day when that
activity pays off.

SAGITTARIUS (November 22- December 21): 
Communications are emphasized today in a big way, Sag. Pick up on delayed
meetings and postponed discussions now. You may need to tread lightly on some
toes at some point in the day, but on the whole, you'll succeed in reaching
agreements. You're especially articulate and persuasive now because what you
have to say makes so much sense. Chalk up a powerful day for dealing with
others, but don't let it go to your head and lead you to force your opinions. 

CAPRICORN (December 22-January 19): 
Messages and information open up and flow for you again today. Something is
sure to try your patience, however. Don't spoil a very productive day by
losing your temper over it, Cappy. It's a good day to catch up on outstanding
payments and bills. Follow up especially on money due you or your company, and
feel confident about making any financial decisions. A rebate of some kind may
also be on the way. The forecast applies to family finances as well as the
workplace.

AQUARIUS (January 20-February 18):
Think this one over, Aquarius. Have you alienated a true friend lately? Blown
up at a loved one? Put a wedge between yourself and some co-workers? You may
start this day off stubbornly holding on to your own point of view, but there
are energies that can help you. Spend some time in thought and you'll come up
with ways to heal the breach you've created. Today promises an end to such
madness, but you're the one who's going to have to do the work. Remember
today's key words -- your relationships.

PISCES (February 19-March 20): 
If you're ever going to win respect for your own point of view, Pisces, you're
going to have to return the favor. We're talking about a relationship of
considerable importance to you. Today offers you an opportunity for a long and
successful chat, but there's something you need to know. Don't be so ready to
put all the focus on what the other person has to realize. There are some
things you have to realize, too. It takes two, you know. There's one more
thing: Drive carefully today, especially in heavy traffic.

driving into toronto at about 6:30 on sat evening, we tuned into 107.9
(energy 108) and just happened to catch flipside's radio show...neuromancer
was there doing a set, and flipside got on the mike and started chatting
with christian and viktor about the party, and he read down the
lineup...andy and i were really excited to hear our names broadcast over
the air by one of toronto's biggest radio stations...grins from ear to ear
:)

then they played the brand new roni size remix of sarah mclachlan's 
'sweet surrender'...wicked tune...

got to the space where preparations were under way, everything was 
looking good...


chilled for a bit, and got back to the space around midnite...the main
floor was pretty full, and we went upstairs to the jungle room to catch
everfresh...he was playing to a pretty sparse crowd, but it was still early
(from what i hear toronto kids tend to arrive sorta late to a party, but
they stay til the end).
                      
12:30 rolls around and andy goes on...starts off with some upfront drum n
bass but as the set goes on he switchs to some *really* nice, really funky
jazzy stuff...kids were starting to filter upstairs around this point.

at the last party that i went to in this space, the 2nd room was in the
basement, so i kept wondering if anyone realized that they could go
*upstairs* (it was closed off last time)...it was kind of frustrating to
seethe main room so packed (and there was a *thick* vibe down there) and
thejungle room not quite so full.

bailey came on after andy and schooled everyone. one of the tightest sets 
we've ever witnessed. a 10" flight case packed full of plates, he played
thetunes you'll all be hearing in about 6 months to a year. flawless set,
thanks for bringing him over, phryl :)

freaky flow came on next, and by this point (4:30) the room was looking
pretty good.  i think most of the kids there were techno heads, and weren't
really into the styles that sine and bailey were playing, freaky flow's
jump up/hip hop/scratching style was easier to get into, which might
explain why
*more* people were in the jungle room for freaky flow than for bailey.

honestly, im not griping. we all had a *wicked* time at the event, i have
alot of friends up in t.o. and everytime i go up there, i make more :)

also, the reinforced tour (which i was trying to catch in the states) was
in town that nite, apparently they booked the toronto show long after word
about progress came out...maybe thats where alot of the toronto junglists
were that nite.

it's a shame, cause talent like bailey dosnt get over here every day, and
to have
two great events competing for the same crowd...nobody wins.

but all that aside, a great production, good sound and lights, everything
ransmoothly and efficiently, great music, smiles all around :)

props to viktor, phil, tanya, and the rest of the phryl crew for pulling
offyet another brilliant event. :)

peace,
hossam

I've never heard Jazzy Jeff spin even though I am from the Philly area.

Afrika Bambata is one of the forefathers of hip-hop.  For me that is the
only reason to see him.  I've have seen him spin close up an all he does is
play records.  He is a human jukebox.

Terry and Derrick are well worth the money.  They are both great D.J.'s.

Here is my review of Progress on Saturday in Toronto...  I was WAY too tired
to write it on Sunday, so here it is today =)

This was only my 2nd Toronto party, and the first was an elitist and abstract
party with the orb, mix master morris, and a live japanese drum act, so I
didn't know exactly what to expect.  

I arrived at the party at around 12:30 after sitting in THICK traffic on Yonge
st for about 30 minutes.  Not 2 minutes after I got there, Adam Beyer, Cari
Lekebusch, and Neuromancer (who, for those who may not know, are THE biggest
names in techno right now ) arrive and walk in.  About 4 minutes later, I
walked into the main room, which was a sort of concert hall in a masonic
temple.  I think Green was spinning at this time, or it may have been Lotus.
In about 10 minutes, Cari Lekebusch took the stage and spun some EXCELLENT
techno.  I didn't really walk around the whole building much until after Adam
Beyer and Neuromancer spun, so I don't know how the rest of it was, but along
with my party on the 4th, that was THE BEST music i have heard for I don't
know how long.  And this wasn't my first time seeing any of swedes.  After
Christian (neuromancer) finished, Adam Marshall spun some slower and deep
techno, during which i walked around and saw the rest of the party.  Then
Kenny Glasgow closed the night, with some HARD techno, and amazingly, there
were still 400/500 people there dancing when he dropped his last record at 9
am.  

I only saw a small handful of Cleveland people there, which is sort of a
shame, considering alot of people didn't want to go to 420, and since Adam and
Cari come to North America VERY rarely.  Toronto is only about 4 hours from
Cleveland, the same distance to Cincinnati, and the parties there are almost
always worth the drive.

Please feel free to call or write and comment on anything you liked or
did not like about the tapes.

See Ya Soon!

Hey Hannibal, this is DJ Kali, and no, I didn't forget your request
for The Deadly Buda Live Set.  I just went through my tapes on the
weekend and found it.  It will arrive at your address in Boston.

I am sorry Stickman dissed you on it.  (Why would he keep two of 'em?)
I mean they were both the live set, so why he did that I do not know.

Anyway that should be going out I would safely say Wednesday, 'cause
I have no idea of how to mail it out tommorrow.  I can tape it 
tommorrow, but in no way, will it go out, so Wednesday is good.

I Appreciate your Patience on this one!
DJ KALI

What's up all? For all of you that made it up to Toronto for PROGRESS this past weekend,
there is nothing to say, but for those who didn't, you should have. This is the
second time I've been up to Toronto for a party. The last was in October for
"Empire," which was also a pHyrL. party. 
  The night began with Green, pHyrL's own from NYC, who opened up the night
with a great Techno set, following was Lotus from Toronto. Then came the
Swedes. If you have ever seen any of these guys before, you know what they have
to offer, but if you haven't, I HIGHLY recommend you should. Cari Lekibush was
the first who delivered some fine Swedish beats, following was Adam Beyer, who
was absolutly amazing, one of the best sets I've ever seen. I also saw Cari
down in Cinncinatti before and he was great, this set though blew that one
away. The last of the Swede's was Christian Smith aka Neuromancer, who was
keepin' the feel going, and delivering some fine Swedish Techno. 
  Next came the local Adam Marshall, all I can say is WOW! I had heard a tape
from this guy and was highly anticipating this set. And damn was it smooth,
spinning some deep, slow, techno. Lastly was Kenny Glasgow, now if you
ever want to hear some of the hardest, darkest, thumping Techno, you have got
to see this dude. He closed the festivities, by keeping the 500+ kids bumping
until the end. 
  Now for upstairs...I only periodically checked out what was going on up
heree, but I got to see the BEST Jungle set I've EVER seen. Bailey from
Metalheadz was spinning a lot of his own shit, keeping everyone in the room in
awe. Freaky Flow, a local from Toronto, followed with his great scratching
skills, making the crowd scream for more. I didn't see any others though, cuz I
was too into the Techno downstairs.
  Also upstairs, was the "Sound Sphere Room." They had Toronto dj's with mad
loads of equipment delivering everything from Intelligent Jungle, to House, to
Ambient. Great chill environment. 
  If anyonne gets the chance to check out another pHyrL party, go! The shit was
really organized and provided some of the best Techno you can get. The Tronto
scene in general is better than any party in the Ohio and surrounding area. For
instance, if you made it out to "Space," some more great Techno I might add,
only about 1/4 of the crowd was on their feet dancing, the rest were sitting on
their asses, giving backrubs and indulging in the mass amounts of hard drugs
they consumed. In Toronto, there will be 2000+ kids filling the dance flow,
staying on their feet until closing time. Don't get me wrong, there are drugs
there, but that isn't what the kids go for, unlike Cleveland, they go for the
vibe, the music, and to dance. Everytime I've gone I've met the nicest people,
and had the best time. If you haven't been to a party up there yet, you must
go!
  
peace.

Yeah - Blakk Steel is like an institution.  He's not a major trickster
like Swamp or Supa-C (although they guest spot on his show occasionally),
but he's had the best, highest quality hiphop show in pgh as long as I can
remember.  Never commercial, always ruff, rugged and raw, with
continuous mix + tricks + guest mcs + enough bs'n to keep it
interesting.  Sadly, this is the last semester doing the show...so listen
in to WPTS 92.1fm Fri nights 9-midnight if you can before he's gone!

There's a chance i might take his coveted slot next fall for a drum & bass
show...but i don't feel too right about it.  We'll see.

> Afrika Bambata........they're old skool.....very old skool;)  All the breakers

afrika bambataa (shit i don't remember where the 2 As go) is a he, the
soul sonic force is a they. the planet rock video was on TV last new
year's eve and i recorded it. the best parts are the 2 breakdancers all in
white dancing outside, and the guy walking on his hands with his legs over
his shoulders and going under this guy bent over backwards upside down. i
don't know the names of these things if they have names. then they played 
step into a world by krs-one. there is a breakdancer in it, almost at the
end, who is spinning on his head and arm and elbow, it's in slowmo, he 
went around 3 or 4 times. watch these videos (if they ever get played
again ={ ) they are so funky. :D

i have heard a few times that phryl, whichever crew/co. does hullaballoo,
and maybe 1 other promoter are the only reliable, not shady promoters in
toronto out of like 20. but i haven't been to any parties in toronto yet,
mainly from a lack of rides and money, but i'm still wanting so bad to go
to a hullaballoo party or one of these by phyrl.

well I was at least trying to dance ;) (hard when you have a piece of
cartilage torn off in your knee that is stuck so you can't move it or
stand on the leg. then i had to rest a lot), where was everybody else? but
if i could have i would have been running and jumping ecstatically all
over and dancing as much as possible all night. yummy hard techno! :9

columbus is EXACTLY like that every time i have been there except usually
on a much smaller scale. ohio isn't all bad. columbus has been pretty
consistent with good vibes, quality music, lack of bullshit, etc. there
are some people throwing parties around akron and cleveland who are doing
this too which is great, but it seems like there's just as many people
around not caring about the people in the party, just the money they're
getting out of them, also like you say people going there to get drugs
and lie around on the floor oblivious all night. the shadiness these
people exude is killing the good vibes and positivity and happiness
everybody else (you know who you all are =] i love ya, keep it up!) is
creating. :/ anyway, wherever you are or wherever you're going, do some
research! is your money going to a good cause, as in funding an even
better future event? vote with your dollars and support those who provide
you with quality events/parties so there can be more.

(for all you college studs and students who live within the 412 area)

(oh and we are broadcasting realaudio on the web now www.wpts/pitt.edu)

no the show on 88.3 doesn't compare, in my humble opinion.  they have
excellent selections but they just play cd's - they never even use the
tables.

yeah, those are the techno terrorists (i thought everyone knew about them).
i have about 20 tapes; i've been listening for about two years.  they are
matt + sean...one of them plays a lot of (i don't want to say: cheesy)
house, but that's just fine.  the show seems to start off with cheese and
progressively reach harder stuff around 11PM -- but, there is probably no
real pattern to the show.  you can call in or request stuff off the net.
future sounds gives them music.  the hometown advantage of this station is:
sometimes they throw their playlists online http://techno.dhp.com/index.html
.

if anyone's looking for more techno on the radio, go read carnegie tech's
programming guide:

Oh my gosh!!!!!  Thundercats is on the Cartoon Network!  I taped it today
because I have chorus every day right after it starts!  Boohoo!  I always
wanted to be Cheetarah (which might make sense because she's the only
girl!)  I guess I sort of wished that Liono was a girl.  Wahoo!
Thundercats Hooooo!

ummmm....because i'm part of wrct, i do know for a fact that a lot of
dj's here use turntables.  as for the show late on friday nights, my one
friend that useto train with terrorists just told me they used a cd
mixer.  but  just because of that doesn't mean they have bad music

i don't see the point of this thread, but to clarify a bit - 

almost all djs that i know at wrct, including myself and my co-host who
do the show after the Techno Terrorists, use TTs. 

the one major exception are the Techno Terrorists, who mix both off CD
and with vinyl (though usually it is more CD). i'm almost positive erica
c does, as does another guy brad, and so did dj karova, as well as all
of the hip-hop djs. 

as for the vinyl collection - yes we are supposed to have the largest
record collection in PA, however barely any of it is techno/jungle/etc -
most of it is rock/jazz/experimental and an ok amount of rap.

wrct- we have more records than you do. (that's a fact!)
as far as I know, the techno terrorists mostly mix off of cd, but you
never know... 
most of the other techno djs, if they mix, mostly do it off of vinyl. it
needs to be said again- vinyl is far superior because you can just do
more cool shit with it. (besides, vinyl sounds better, more organic)
that's that.

i have managed to forget mentioning this for a long time but i maintain an
informal ele_email list featuring updates on upcoming columbus ele_mental
(and ele_related) events, often with directions and detailed lineups and
artist info. it's sent out only as an event approaches. 

you get most of the same info through my posts to the mw and pb-cle lists,
but through the ele_list, i do usually provide more specific event info,
and promote a few more locally-oriented events which i don't post
elsewhere. 

i decided to mention this now because we have a lot of smaller events
coming up, and i figured there's probably a few of you who are in the
central ohio area who didn't even know i maintained such a listing.  i'm
also guessing there's a handful of out-of-towners who would just like to
be kept up-to-date in a more personal way.

so if you want to get on our mass-mailing list, please reply to this
message with your full email address.  if you can, also give me a word or
two as to why you want to be on the list, where you're from, or just
general feedback on how we're doing our job.

ThunderCats Hooooo   I like panthrow he Seemed at lest pretty Dependable

Your horoscope for Tuesday, April 21, 1998

ARIES (March 21-April 19):  
People in your life want some of your time today, Aries. Work off the busier
part of your schedule as early in the day as you can. You'll need to leave
time for an unexpected friendly visit or call, and you'll certainly want to
leave some time for other things on a day that brings romantic promises. Some
of you who have launched a new love interest will discover today that it's
going someplace after all. The climate says you're due to receive and give
much affection today, so don't crowd out the time you need to do so.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20): 
This week is a good time for private chats and a low profile. Working quietly
on your own is your best modus operandi now. An inner sense tells you this is
so. Obey it. The fact is, Taurus, you could get some of your best work in
months accomplished this way. Trust best friends and mates as the only
sounding boards for any complaints you have. Not until you reach an
understanding of your inner self should you attempt to lay your case out in
the open or force issues.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21):  
Rewards for past efforts come due today, Gem. Not only should your work go
smoothly, but you should reap some special success. It's a good day to market
your talents and abilities, and it's especially good for the self-employed.
Many Gems will take the first step into a brighter future. Some may celebrate
an engagement now. Events seem to be the result of someone else's appreciation
of you. It could be a higher-up or a close tie, but either way it's a happy
day for you.

CANCER (June 22-July 22):  
Don't expect time for any breaks or a long lunch, Cancer. You've got a lot of
work to clear away before you can relax today. There could be a real
breakthrough on a budgetary matter. If you've been waiting for approval for a
special use of funds, it could come through today. By the end of the day, you
should feel pretty good about what you managed to accomplish. Face the day
with self-confidence. Your abilities are simply being challenged, not
questioned.

LEO (July 23-August 22): 
You may close a deal that you've been working on for some time. Meetings and
interviews are set to go so well today that some of you may be accepting a new
position. These possibilities are so strong today that you should approach any
talks with complete confidence. It's almost certain that something important
is going to go your way. Romance continues to be joyful, and married Leos will
feel a special closeness with their mates. You may be surprised to discover
that you have new insights into what love really means. 

VIRGO (August 23-September 22):
High energy helps you to accomplish a great deal today. That's good, because
there's much more in store for you. In terms of romantic relationships, it's a
day for deeper commitment. Yes, and here's how to go about it. Take advantage
of opportunities for intimacy and joy. For married couples, the result is a
strengthening of loving bonds. For those involved in a serious relationship,
the possibility of wedding plans is real. For all you singles, we're sorry to
say that new introductions are not definite. But what the heck, you could try.

LIBRA (September 23-October 22): 
Both your own creative work and collaborations with others go well. You'll
find it easy today to work smoothly with others, and there is no longer any
danger of a moody minefield to walk through. You and your mate should also
find it easy to reach decisions that benefit the family. In short, you'll be
functioning in your typically Libran way, finding relationships easy to
manage. Yeah, and you're glad to see it back in good form again, aren't you? 

SCORPIO (October 23-November 21):
Home and property matters take precedence today. Some of you will finally be
completing plans for a change of residence. Yeah, we mean those plans that
have been up and down for months. You won't agree with everything said to you
today, especially if it comes in the form of advice. That's because you feel
certain of where you're going and what you need to do about it. Besides,
people should know better than to make comments that sound like commands to
you. Your career prospers now, Scorp. 

SAGITTARIUS (November 22- December 21): 
Today is another day when your words are skillfully assembled and your mind is
sharp. It's a good day for mental work and projects that require great
attention to detail. In fact, most of your focus today is on your work.
Surprisingly, you feel the need to get others to perform at their best. You'll
be talking some people out of their worries and fears. And you'll find your
verbal skills useful at home, too. Plan for some refreshing entertainment or
recreation tonight. 

CAPRICORN (December 22-January 19): 
Your social life is highlighted today, but more important, so is your love
life. That's where you'll find the day's best enjoyment. Some of you will make
your first advances in a new romance today. Of course, if you're already
involved, you may find that it's a good time to take the big plunge. Even if
you don't, you'll be happy with the progress of any ongoing romance tonight.
Shopping for domestic supplies is favored, but concentrate on necessities
rather than luxuries. 

AQUARIUS (January 20-February 18):
A continuance of sober thought can provide new solutions to old problems. It's
not that you don't have the insights into yourself that will help. It's that
you've ignored them. Use that fine mind of yours to take an insistent look at
reality. We know it's been hard. You've been shadowboxing with confusing facts
and ideas for some time now. Chalk it up to two difficult energies in your Sun
sign -- a foggy perception and a heavy dose of impulsiveness. Come on, pal.
You can work this out.

PISCES (February 19-March 20): 
Both work and financial matters go well today. Yes, that includes shopping,
but you'll find what you want off the beaten track. The best news is that an
answer you've been waiting for comes early in the week. If you didn't get it
yesterday, look for it today. This possibility is directly related to your
career hopes. Indulge a thoughtful mood after work. Just remember that you're
searching for insights, not worries or problems, Pisces.

yeah, what better place to write pointless messages about cartoons and
post daily horoscopes than on a rave-releated mailing list.

stop wasting everyone's time and take this bullshit somewhere else.

PAAAAAAACCCCCEEEEEEE!!!!!

Tranzor-Z rocked all known sheep!  That cartoon was frightening addictive
(and horribly dubbed, but that's the charm of it).  Every afternoon or on
Sunday mornings at nine.  I wish the Cartoon Network would pick up on it.
I also miss Robotech.  Oh, for the dream of having a VCR in those days, I
need a toon-bender...

pHryL.'s next event is "SUB PHUNC 27" in Pittsburgh on May 16, in
collaboration with House of Styles. We promise to offer another good show,
with several very interesting things in terms of decoration, sound set-up
and lighting style. Christian Smith (Neuromancer) and Adam Marshall from
Progress will be making the trip to Pittsburgh, along with Vapourspace, DJ
Fake, Alexi Delano, John Selway, Mike Bryant, Miss Sage Molotov, Point
Alpha, with the local representation by Pure, the Instigator and Product 19.
Be sure to check that out if you have a chance as we showcase Swedish
techno, along with some great techno, tech-house and tech-trance
DJ's/producers from NYC, LA and Miami and deep D&B from Upstate NY. We will
try to bring the Toronto flavour down in this area for the ones who can't
travel up there. If anyone needs a flyer, or is interested in offering some
promotional help, please e-mail me your address. We would greatly appreciate
your help.

	P.S. Just to address [JuNgLALieN@aol.com]'s comment, the only
Swedish DJ who played in Erie
	was Alexi Delano at Platonic Love (4/12/97). We were not graced by
the presence of Adam, Cari or 
	Christian here before...  And Alexi has not yet played in Toronto
(due to his visa status in 
	the US). As soon as he is allowed to, we will have him there!

Just me DJ KALI and I decided to help some of you (you cute guys know
who you are!)  about what kind of party to throw and how to do it, and
who I know that does it best.

It couldn't hurt Pittsburgh if you forgot about some of these big
names and maybe turn around and LOOK to see if there is any talent
in your backyard!

Things I am seeing...

1.  A lot of local DJ's get lousy slots.
2.  Most locals never get to spin at parties, except small ones.
3.  Most various kinds of music never really get heard.  Hardcore,
Ambient, stuff that is rarely heard.

Thing is most people dissed Deadly Buda for the parties he did, but
one thing the guy did no one seems to do is see what is available 
under their noses.  I mean HIS DEADLINESS put as much into local talent 
as the Headliners, no one was second best.  But as I see
it, a lot of locals are being used as fillers.  Just put ANYTHING
ANYBODY in that slot OK!  That shouldn't be the case.

It is fine to go ahead book a few BIG NAMES, but to sacrifice the
supporting locals, that is getting way out of hand.

Just my thinking thought of today, and missing the vibe of the past,
(maybe I'm love sick over HIS DEADLINESS by listening to His tape,
I dunno.)

DJ KALI

snip....
I was around with Buda back in the day, and he did focus attention on
locals.... the locals who deserved it. I too support the locals, here in
Cleveland, having a guest local at my thursday club almost every week,
playing at the main hour.

But one thing.... the Locals... the new Dj's have to make sure they got
skills before wanting the dope slots! I get tapes from kids every week, and
I listen to all of them, and let me tell you.... a lot of em suck!! I am
not trying to come off as arrogant, but 4 trainwrecks a side is pretty bad.
And then later I will hear the said Dj complain about me not booking them,
or what time slot they got.

Buda focused on the locals that put time and effort into there Djing, and
so do I, but the upcomming Dj's need to really take the time to get good
before "comming out". There are a few Dj's that reciently emerged from the
Cleveland/Pitts scene who Rock.And most of them have been doin small gigs
or sittin at home practicing for a few years! Take my boy Kevin
Cunningham.... Kevin started practicing about 3 1/2 years ago, and did not
play out till .... ohhhhh I think last summer. But when he did play, people
were like ...DAMN.... kid got skills! And that's the way it should be. It's
a lot easier to support locals when thay got the skills, instead of trying
to support a dj that may need another year of practice.
Don't get me wrong, all the Dj's that gave me tapes... I'm not doggin you
directly, you all can be excellent Dj's.... just don't rush it.. take your
time and things will be a lot more exciting when you do break out!

Trust me,If you can relate this to Djing... I got into golf reciently, and
I'm bustin my ass tryin to get good, but I know I'll need at least 4 more
years before I can say "I PLAY GOLF".
Shit even if some one offered me a spot to play at a pro match, at this
point I'd be the comic relief! But in 4 years or so with lots of
practice.....INTRODUCING.... Happy C.. the Dennis Rodman of the PGA!!!

Peace,
Sleepy C

I thought that this would be appropriate to send to all of you, considering
that the topic here occasionally is school (high school or college). The
following is from a 1950's Home Economics textbook intended for High School
girls:  "How to prepare for married life".  (Side note: What an amazing leap!
Just try to picture a "raver"-girl in this role!! Had me rolling on the
floor!) Peace... Casey
 
    1. Have dinner ready:  Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a
    delicious meal, on time.  This is a way of letting him know that
    you have been thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs.
    Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospects of a good
    meal are part of the warm welcome needed.

    2. Prepare yourself:  Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed
    when he arrives.  Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair and
    be fresh looking.  He has just been with a lot of work-weary people.
    Be a little gay and a little more interesting. His boring day may need
    a lift.
 
    3. Clear away the clutter.  Make one last trip through the main part
    of the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up school
    books, toys, paper, etc.  Then run a dust cloth over the tables.  Your
    husband will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and it
    will give you a lift too.
 
    4. Prepare the children:  Take a few minutes to wash the children's
    hands and faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if necessary,
    change their clothes.  They are little treasures and he would like to
    see them playing the part.
 
    5. Minimize the noise:  At the time of his arrival, eliminate all
    noise of washer, dryer, dishwasher, or vacuum.  Try to encourage the
    children to be quiet.  Be happy to see him. Greet him with a warm
    smile and be glad to see him.
 
    6. Some DON'TS:  Don't greet him with problems or complaints.  Don't
    complain if he's late for dinner.  Count this as minor compared with
    what he might have gone through that day.
 
    7. Make him comfortable:  Have him lean back in a comfortable chair
    or suggest he lie down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready
    for him.  Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes.  Speak
    in a low, soft, soothing and pleasant voice.  Allow him to relax and
    unwind.
 
    8. Listen to him:  You may have a dozen things to tell him, but the
    moment of his arrival is not the time.  Let him talk first.
 
    9. Make the evening his:  Never complain if he does not take you
    out to dinner or to other places of entertainment; instead try to
    understand his world of strain and pressure and his need to be home
    and relax.
 
   10. The Goal:  Try to make your home a place of peace and order
    where your husband can relax.

Oh... I am WAY of school. But actually, I will never be FREE of it... I am a
teacher now (seventh year). I finished my Master's and Phd here in Cleveland
(Undergrad at OSU~~ woo-hoo!!!!!) ;-) But I see this kind of thing all the
time when I go through some of my older colleagues' teaching materials...
amazing isnt it? Peace... Casey

This was mailed to me at another email address I have, along with many other
addressees. I thought I would send it along because amongst the spelling and
grammatical errors, there is a message that may be tired and over-discussed/
commented on in this list, but nonetheless is relevant to our rave-theory and

 Tranzor-Z rocked all known sheep!  That cartoon was frightening addictive
 (and horribly dubbed, but that's the charm of it).  Every afternoon or on
 Sunday mornings at nine.  I wish the Cartoon Network would pick up on it.
 I also miss Robotech.  Oh, for the dream of having a VCR in those days, I

Just a reminder that the Inaudible radio/webcast is broadcasting
all the latest and greatest techno & house music Wednesday from 
9-11 pm eastern standard time. On this week's show you can
expect to hear unreleased tracks from Detroit Escalator Co
and Low Res plus new material from Boards of Canada, 
Moodymann, Theo Parrish, Mark Broom to name a few.

During the Inaudible show we will be giving away promo 12"s 
and cds so yet another reason to tune in. 

The show will be accessible by visiting WCSB 89.3 FM for
those in the cleveland area. For those people out of the area

Digital Genesis

Info Web Site: www.noguestlist.com

Rumor is the space will be brand spanking new, it's in the Strip District,
and has a capacity of over 3000 people. Should be a good time :)

Dan

Oh yeah, as for rumors, rumor has it that SubPhunc 27 (Phryl/House of
styles) will be in the Irish Centre, with twice as much sound as has ever
been put in there before, and it will be layed out with the djs opposite the
doors, i.e. the long side of the room. That's gonna be tha bomb as well.

ARIES (March 21-April 19):  
A deceptive influence hovers around your financial dealings today. That
doesn't always mean someone is lying to you about it. You could be kidding
yourself with a bright idea that you haven't fully investigated. The key is to
avoid impulsive buying and trading. Stick to reasonable deals with reasonable
expectations. People rarely double their money overnight, and steady
conservative gains are safer than some pie-in-the-sky scheme. Yeah, you hate
that word "conservative" don't you? Make it your motto today anyway.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20): 
Call this a relief day. Warm and wonderful relations with loved ones are
always vital to your well-being, and here's a day to soak it all up. The
emphasis is on having some fun. Keep that in mind when people not so close to
your heart seem to be taking advantage of you or trying to pull a fast one.
That's not important. What's important is to recharge your batteries in the
company of your favorite people. Some of you will have a red-letter day in
romance. Well, you know, sometimes Venus just smiles.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21):  
It's another great day for business or career, Gem. You feel charged with
enthusiasm now as events unfold. There's a warning flag about finances. Almost
everyone needs to be careful about money deals today. It's really not enough
to cloud your own wide horizons, as long as you stay away from dubious ideas,
especially the ones that aren't your own. Still, you should be careful about
details and fine print today. You're good at that anyway, particularly when
you put your mercurial mind to it.

CANCER (June 22-July 22):  
You're probably going to have to deal with more hard work today. A new
assignment is going to require some backup study before you attack it. Today's
deceptive trend affects financial affairs, and it affects almost everyone.
That means that some people (like you, for instance) are in danger of being
misled and others are cheerfully involved in the misleading. Cheer up and look
forward to indulging a romantic mood that's moving in now. A matter at a
distance, perhaps overseas, seems to show up now, too.

LEO (July 23-August 22): 
Guard against confusing or incomplete information. If people can't give you a
straight answer, it's more likely that they don't want to. Still, there's an
air of cooperation about your work with others today. You find it easy to get
along with most people. Help comes from unexpected places, and you may find
that service providers are willing to give you extra satisfaction. Just take
that one danger seriously. Don't let anyone try to fool you with claims about
not having answers to your questions.

VIRGO (August 23-September 22):
That trend for heightened romance continues. Yeah, we know we've been talking
about this for a long time, but sooner or later it's going to kick in. You
should have caught on by now that the repetition of excellent opportunities in
love is what makes this year a romantic one for you. Anyway, it's another day
for warm and deep feelings and outcomes. You wanna hear about work instead?
Why? Things couldn't be going any better in your career either. Geez, Virgo,
you already know that.

LIBRA (September 23-October 22): 
We know it's one of your favorite pastimes, but skip the shopping today,
Libra. Neither buying nor selling is favorable. A business function turns into
a social pleasure for you. That's a switch, because you habitually turn social
functions into business advantages. Take a careful stance with the flirtatious
manner of a business associate. Sure, it could be true romance, but it could
sure be something less promising, too. Besides, who says you have to decide
immediately which it is? We thought you liked plenty of time to decide.

SCORPIO (October 23-November 21):
Today's best feature is the focus on your love life. You may have been too
busy to notice the subtle changes in your partner's thinking. One of the most
amusing things about you is how unaware you can be of your effect on others.
Well, you're going to be blissfully surprised at the new direction your
romance takes now. Gee, and here you thought it was all up to you, Scorp. Oh,
there's just one more thing. It's not a good day to sign papers, especially
things like contracts and deeds. Tell 'em it'll have to wait.

SAGITTARIUS (November 22- December 21): 
You'll continue to see progress on the job today, and you'll feel immense
satisfaction because of it. Pay careful attention to incoming information,
however. You need to question the source and the methods for gathering facts.
Today's probability that something won't be what it seems makes it necessary
to do this. Make sure to check details, but especially keep an eye out for the
possibility of missing information. You may have to research the whole matter
yourself before you can relax on that point.

CAPRICORN (December 22-January 19): 
Today should bring some promising developments and a piece of very good news.
Someone may try to involve you in a risky financial plan, however. You want to
give that one a wide berth. There's a risk of misjudgment in the air today,
especially when it involves trusting a proposal on face value. Believe us,
there's very little substance behind that face. You're in particular danger
because the ploy will be aimed at your business ability. Skip it, and turn
your attention to a better way to spend your time tonight. Yeah.

AQUARIUS (January 20-February 18):
Today's deceptive aspects complicate your life all the more. While everyone
else is in danger or being victimized by con artists, you're more likely to be
kidding yourself. You may be still finding it hard to let go of an unrealistic
scheme. Get your mind off of it and treat yourself to a sense of beauty with a
special gift or outing. Not only will that afford you great pleasure, but it
should put you back in touch with yourself. That bright brain of yours can
help, too. Consider things from the perspective of an objective observer.

PISCES (February 19-March 20): 
This should be fun. Someone mistakes your natural compassion for gullibility
and tries to put that mistaken notion to use. The attempt could involve
foisting some troublesome gossip on you, hoping to win your allegiance.
Somehow, we don't think it's going to work. It's a good day to complete or
even initiate important communications. Later on, a choice romantic influence
makes up for feelings of uncertainty in your love life. Enjoy a lovely and
enchanting mood.

Fraggles Rock!!!!! 
if the fraggles ever threw a rave, it would be awesome. 
a rave in a cave, yum. 
some of their music was rather technoey, especially the doozerish stuff. 
anyone remember the episode where they discovered 'yippie water'?
and i would love to see a techno remix of 
"Funeral Dirge You Can Dance To" and some other random songs
*sings "pick me up and lay me down and spread the news all over town
and tell them all to come or they'll be sorry
pick me up and shake me twice
i'm coming back from paradise
this poor boy is here to live in glory...
dance your cares away
worries for another day
let the music play
down in fraggle rock...
what we are is what we play never get a holiday
ecstasy's the only pay 
music makes us real
round and round round we go where we stop we never know
round and round to and fro singing as we go...
when you long for the height of the mountains when you long for the blue
leave your heart where its deep and its down again
lose your heart til its new
seek your heart on the high blue skyway
keep your heart and its bound
steep your heart in the deep of the earth again
lose your heart and its found...
music grows in the rose rock and rain and the blowing snowstorm
everything seems to sing everywhere i go
i say one two play me do let me sound as sweet as you
play me loud play me long let me be your song
play me down on the ground
song comes singing from the midnight places
play me high in the sky
song comes drifting through
play me high play me low play me where the wild winds blow
play me wide play me long play me for your song"
music keeps the rock alive, 
music keeps us all alive.
and fraggles are the embodiment of PLUR in foam form
and wow i haven't slept in way too long now.
and i haven't danced in way too long now.
does anyone have anything to tell me about the scene in southern
california? thinking of moving out there soon.
also, some friends and i have been wondering:
there is such an incredible amount of positive energy at every rave.
can you Imagine what could be done with that energy 
if it was at all focused?
but what could possibly be a worthy focusing point?
just a fraction of a thought..

A big NO on the horoscopes. Everyone complains about stuff
being off-topic on this list, and now we are getting horoscopes?

Jeez-- anyone that's literate and has Netscape or a newspaper can get
Horoscopes.  

There's no need to overload my already heavy inbox with yet another 20,000
k message.

Vote "no" on proposition H.

I used to be really interested in my horoscopes, especially because I'm on
the cusp of Leo and Cancer.  Most of my friends were deeply into
astrology, etc.  In fact, some of them, when we first met, were able to
tell me what sign I was as well as a lot about me.  I admit, I read my
horoscope in the IP and CP.  Still my horoscope does not consume my
curiousity.  I'm sorry Static guy.  I say no on the horoscope.

I say leave the hoeroscope issue alone.  this is a free-form list; he is not
obligated to send them everyday.  i view it as a service to the list and he
is trying to be nice/help/confuse people with no religion/etc..  We can
manage an extra 8K per Day.  if you have something against horoscopes, do
not click on it or press 'd' (how many times have we been through this?).
Who is to say what value is assigned to each message?  Whether it is someone
saying "yes", "having a conversation with someone else while broadcasting to
the entire list", or someone trying to tell everyone how to think (or the
*correct* way to think)..which therefore renders my entire message "VOID"

Ok, if 'scopes are ok, then can we start talking about cars too?  How about 
the conflict in ireland?  Maybe clinton's schlong?  Get real folks.  This list
is for pittsburg/cleveland raves.  End of story.  No horoscopes, no cartoons, 
no cars, none of that.  Just all raves.  Tastefully done, but definately all 
raves.

On the subject of horoscopes.

End this thread NOW please.  We don't need it, and it seems that the
people in support of it are the same people who OBVIOUSLY post to feel
important.  There are plenty of places to read your daily horoscope, and I
am QUITE sure that there are several mailing lists that will send you a
soroscope... we don't need it here.

Now, if you agree with me... fine.  If you don't, then please subscribe to
alt.drama.teen.wannabeimportant.thinktheyalreadyareimportant.immature.ravers
to carry this discussion out further.

Also, please, no flames about how "dated" the use of
alt.you.suck.go.to.hell flames are.  Most of the people on this list
wouldn't remember their use the first time around ;)

Tay Sachs:

You missed my point.  I said that FACESTATIC is performing a service to the
list.  Although, under current dogma..you are free to speak of the size of
the president's penis and conflicts in other nations... You have to
understand that you cannot classify and regulate every mailing list.  People
who rave also do other things, and as it has been proved in the past, they
may even relate to "raving".  Thank you very much, we will continue to talk
about cartoons, stuffed animals, clothes, the way people think, mathematics,
drugs, neurotransmitters, and other things that are fun!  Just cheel.

	It cracks me up that this conversation always seems to come up 
every few months or so.  I guess I've seen it at least four or five times
and I've only been on the list since about September or October!  Oh my
gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!  I'm on a rave list....now what? 
  	So what do we talk about?  Do we exclusively talk about raves?
After awhile, and I know some of you agree with me, it becomes BORING to
talk only about raves and music.  I think that even as a list, we become
bored, thus explaining our seemingly innocent posts about cartoons,
horoscopes, etc.  
	Of course, we shouldn't be talking about "Clinton's schlong" (but
then, again who should), but there are other things we all pretty much
have in common.  Very often these commonalities are brought up because
there's something we were talking about connected to a party.  Awhile ago,
weren't we talking about video games, and wasn't that conversation started
because someone brought up the spectacle of video games being played at a
party somewhere?  Then there was the Sailor Moon fiasco when someone
brought up the idea of a Sailor Moon inspired party!  And what about the
arguements over morals, religion, philosophy?  Think, weren't many of
those started over reviews of parties, stolen records, etc.?  I wish I
could chart our posts.  I think it would end up looking like a spiderweb,
with raves at the center of it all.
	After we find that some of us have very similar thoughts, likes,
dislikes, etc., many of us branch off and just have our own conversations
and friendships.  Just a thought.

No, I'm never going to read it, because I don't really care about
horoscopes too much.
Why doesn't somebody just make their own mailing list so that only
selected people will get it?

i'm glad someone else on this list isn't discussing horoscopes...

anyways, is no one else pissing their pants about this????

i love sasha and digweed...sure...people say they have no talent, they
can't mix, too many breakdowns and buildups, blah blah blah...all i know
is that on march 27, 1998 i had the most amazing time ever at twilo in
NYC when these two were spinning...it was fucking incredible and i WAS
NOT under the influence of any chemical substances...

it's annoying that it's on may 30th though...for the past year i've
missed their sets every month at twilo cause i couldn't make the trip
out to NYC...and now that they're coming to pittsburgh, there's a chance
i'll be in NYC that day...hrrrmm...

anyway, what's this new place it's going to be at???

Okay, I've had my fill of all this arguing.

WTF happened to PLUR here?

I treat the horoscopes with the same policy I treat spam; I don't wanna
read it, so I don't, and I delete it. If you're too immature to NOT read
something, and delete it, then you have no real right whining. Nobody's
FORCING you to read it. If you don't want to read it, you don't. Bottom
line. Now can we PLEASE get back to normal insanity?

hm... let's see... this is pb-cle*raves*, so I think it should be about
rave related things. if you want to read email about other things, maybe
you should just write to some of the people on the list *individually*.
sorry, but pb-cle is not my life, so I have no problem with it being a
restricted-topic list.

Lets take a trip out into the deep far realms of possibility.

Imagine yourself with a life that involved interests including raving, but
also outside raving.

Imagine yourself subscribed to say 10 mailing lists. for your 10 different
interests.

Imagine sifting through every piece of irrelevant drivel (about %50 or so?)
that you get in pb-cle raves times 10...

bleah.

I vote no to Horoscopes.

I'm not saying dont post a message that doesnt have the word rave in it,
just make some sort of small attempt to pause before you post, reflect apon
what you have written (heh, maybe even read it to make sure it's readable so
you wont have to spam us twice with your nonsense, and a spellcorrected
version of your nonsense), think if it's considered even part of the rave
culture, then submit it.

Thanks for letting me waste your bandwidth.

Dan

As she said in the rest of her post, how do you define 'rave-related'?
If you are clever enough, you can probably find a twisted enough
path to link anything back to raves. So should we all go just by
your definition of what is proper for this list or just let the 
conversation
flow? 
 
-Az

Maybe you should start a separate list: 
'strictly-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org' and it could be the true raves
list.

-it is brand new
-it is clean
-it is legal
-it is called something like "crane" I couldn't understand and the

and I've heard great stuff about this guy . . . was he at temptation?
-noguestlist are planning events there that "will boggle your mind".

I hope this is on the up and up, because this may be the thing that pgh

They are most definitely not E (MDMA), and have been sold to me
at the last several parties I have been to. I did a little research and
came up with this:

from Pihkal #106:  MDE; MDEA; EVE; N-ETHYL-MDA; 
(with 200 mg) Very stoned. There was some nausea in the beginning of the 
experience. As it developed I found it very difficult to concentrate on 
what I was thinking or saying simply due to the extraordinary nature of 
coming on to this material. There is noticeable jaw-clenching and rice 
crispies in the ears. This is a meditative material not unlike MDMA 
except there are more difficulties in forming words. And there is a 
problem in focusing the eyes, what I want to call `eye-romp.' My 
anorexia was extremely long-lived-- perhaps a total of 72 hours. This 
may have been too high a dosage. 

I took two of those one night and that's exactly what it felt like.
Didn't want to dance, talk, or even think. Felt nice, but not for
a rave. I just wanted to sit there and stare at the dancefloor.

Don't bitch at me for talking about drugs, I'm just trying to
let people know what they are getting.

-Az

yeah... he's f*%kin incredible. during his set, the dancefloor wasn't
all that packed, but everyone who was dancing or listening was blown
away. he played a set of the most subliminal trance i have ever heard.
i dont know if sumbliminal trace is actually a style, but that is the
best description i can give it. my friend (who was trippin) liked it
so much he danced throughout the entire set without stopping, and when
he was done, he was like "oh my god! who was that last guy? he was SO
fucking good... every sound that came out of the speaker connected
with me.. it was amazing... that was the greatest musical experience i
have ever had in my entire like... etc. etc."

Just felt like I should drop some of the mad rumors I hear from my
underground german gnome friends.  According to my sources, this
"No-Guest-List" productions crew is a big money crew who deceided it would
be a good idea to get into rave promotions.  They got their idea for
getting Sasha & Digweed by looking at a copy of that zine (cough cough)
'sweater'.  Take that for what its worth - and let me remind you that I'm
not responsible for what i hear, for i am a perfect angel. :P

Reguardless of their motives, I'm always happy to see new promoters at
least trying to put something together.

We def could use more promoters that are up * up & have the resources to
put quality events together.

i probably just went past it today. i went to pittsburgh today for the
1st time ever (!) for an art field trip and i couldn't tell which river is
which but as we left in a western direction we went over a river, then
passed like a mile of warehouses and about every other one is empty. =D

i agree, they are available anywhere. well static said there are no more
horoscopes anyway, but in the event that something of this nature happens
again in the future, i would say the 2 most mature and respectful (to the
listmembers) things to do would be:

1. start a separate mailing list for the subject, like absolut said.

or

2. put your information on a webpage.

you can even put "send a message to this address for the ________ mailing
list" or "________ website: http://..." in your signature. that's
perfectly acceptable. but if you post a message:

* every day
* that is completely not-rave-related 
* and this big: 7,953 (does that stand for bytes or what?) 
* and only a few people are ever going to want to read it...

it's inconsiderate because you're using up a ton of bandwidth, and if
there's a digest for this list (i think there is), the people getting it
have to scroll through several really long messages that half don't even
care about. so everybody think about stuff like this please if you haven't
before. thanks!

Nah, this is 2 rooms, and CONSERVATIVLY estimated at 3k people capacity. I
think millenium is like 1k max on a good day when the firemarshall isnt

          Full ON

qpg and mb sound and light are presenting an
outdoor daytime/evening event north of pittsburgh.
while the party is free, purchase of a $10 bus
ticket will make attendance much easier as parking
is reserved primarily for the talent and
production crews.

Full ON will be held April 26th from 2PM to 12AM
and feature the first area appearance of JOSH RYAN
in quite some time.  Other esteemed DJ's include
PGH's smoothest jazzy groove innovator, SAINT, the
legendary DUST, all-time champion RUFFIAN, steaming
hot FUNK TEA, mad junglist KIRA, and of course the man
everyone begs to be punished by, THE INSTIGATOR.

There will be a surprise house set by a local DJ
whose skills are known only those in the overworld.
Making a P.A. will be experimentalists L.P.N.
featuring ED-UM and 666 AUDIO and a long awaited
appearance from OMBIENSE who haven't been seen
since their P.A. at Trancednece 3-1/2 years ago!

More info can be obtained through the infoline:
   >>  321-DJDJ  <<

Bus tickets will be available starting this week at
HYPERVINYL, TIMEBOMB, and during PLATFORM SOUL on
Tuesdays at ZYTHOS (21+), or through the promoters
and DJ's.  This is very renegade, very unprecedented,
and 100% secure.

No Markers, Glass, Drugs, Alcohol, Weapons, Attiude,
or Littering will be tolerated.  Keep the vibe postive and real.
Feel free to bring food, blankets, water, juice, energy, and friends.
There will be a grill availble for those who wish to cook.

Listen to Artificial Gravity on Radio Carson for
more announcements.

Don't think it's just one guy who happens to have these for sale.  Drug
dealers certainly don't makes their stuff; and they usually don't have a clue
what they're actually selling.  I think it's safe to say that a
huge batch of these were produced somewhere maybe not even in the area, and 
were bought by many, many dealers over a multi-state area.  Maybe some guy in
New York made a pound of the stuff and it spread out to all his guys, then all
their guys, etc.  At any rate, the chance of getting actual MDMA when you buy
"E" is only about 50%.  The other half of the time one will actually be getting
MDA, MDE, or a substance that is nothing like these, like pseudo-ephedrine or
simple aspirin.  Certainly when a dealer refers to a pill as a bit "smacky" you
should assume you're getting one of those other, E-like substances.  (not that 
it actually has anything like smack cut with it anyway.  This is completely
false).

If you wonder where I get my information I can tell you if you send mail to
me.  Also, the guy who wrote the original post really knows his stuff.

I have to go public with this one, I am unable to access your Website
for some odd reason.

This is DJ Kali and I just want to know if you would like free tapes
that I made.  

I am glad Digital Genesis is being thrown on May 16th.  My Birthday
is on the 20th.  I will be 35.  35?!  NO!  NOT ME!  Wait....
1963 take from 1998...OH GEEZ!  But I don't look it, and I don't feel
it...AND I SURE AS HELL DON'T DANCE LIKE IT!!!  People my age do
stuff like HAVE CAREERS, FAMILIES, DO BORING THINGS, STOP DOING THINGS
ALTOGETHER!  They don't Rave, they don't go and listen to Techno unless 
they go to METROPOL and get stuck there listening to it, maybe
not even understanding it, or what the history of it is or was....

Gee, maybe this is my DESTINY?  Yeah, 'fraid so.  

Anyway the tapes I made are HARDCORE and it is in 2 parts.  One part
is pretty hard, the second more Jungle beats here and there.

DEADLY BUDA approved of them, said the choices were good, and the
differences in the second tape make it very interesting since it is
not the same BOMP BOMP BOMP it adds more variety.  And he would know
for listening to His stuff, it is phenominal.  Only He can put in
an interrupt that would crash anyone elses' set, make it work for Him,
but I am NOT THAT GOOD LIKE HE IS!!!

Some of His stuff can be so demented, it makes me wonder HOW DOES HE
DO IT?  Thing is I am putting together a new tape now, the first
side Hard yet, Trancey.  The second Way Dark.  I already dreamt of
the cover.  It is called YIN & YANG and I can't wait to work on the
dark stuff tonite.  It hasn't quite made my standards yet.  The 
ingredients are there, but it needs more of this, some of that, maybe
something else.  But the 2 part set is ready.

Please contact me, my E-mail is:  djkali@hotmail.com
My Voice Mail is:  1-412-260-0066

Hope to hear from you soon.

DJ KALI

Gotta go public on this one, can't reach www.nogueslist.com and trying
to get pHryL.

Now I get home and see I read it wrong again!!!

May 16 (apologies guys)  is pHryL Sub Phunc 27.  Okay.
and May 30 is Digital Genesis!  Good thing I got a calendar at home
THIS 1/2 HR SUCKS!  I can't read everything in detail of 1/2 hr. and
comprehend!!!  :(  

Okay for pHryL and NoGuestlist, free tapes!!!  Gee, most I can do
for getting all messed up like this!!!

So if you guys would like tapes, my E-mail is djkali@hotmail.com
and Voice Mail is 1-412-260-0066  Major Duh I know I know.

Anyway the truth about Buda is still on the first message I sent
looking for www.noguestlist.com and yeah, only He could do things I
sure as heck never gonna figure out.

Well, hope you like the tapes anyway guys!  AT LEAST I HAVE TIME TO
HAVE THEM MAKE MORE SENSE than I do when I am on the Website!!!

(Soon to be 35 and already confused they have a word for that.)

DJ KALI  ("Are you sure that is your name dear?"  OH SHUT UP!!!)

Greetings to any Promoters!!!  This is DJ Kali, and just to let
anyone know free tapes are available, as well as information on 
people that are willing to help out planning parties.

Apologies to pHryL and No Guestlist for messing up on whose doing
what!  ("Maybe this Technology is too much for you. I mean at your age!"  
SHUT UP! I ONLY GET 1/2 HR!)

Anyway, to anyone out there the tapes are a whole lot more together
than I am.  Besides I HAVE TIME to do what I want on those, here in
Library World, goodness!!!  OH!  There goes 10 minutes already!

Gotta Go!

Well, hey! From one 35 year old to another, happy b-day a little early!
I have been 35 for oh, about 6 months now, and I can honestly say, I
sure don't look, feel or act like what most ppl expect 35 yos to be like
either. Ain't it great??!! 

> Gee, maybe this is my DESTINY?  Yeah, 'fraid so.

No most definitely not! I wanted to post this to the list to remind
everyone there is not death after 25. Hell, I have a full-time job, and
wear a suit to work. Basicaly what growing older means is finally having
enough money to go to most of the parties I want to, getting over many
of the shynesses and insecurities of the young. Whoo hoo! Being a raver
at this age is the ultimate! I'm sure Kali will back me up. 

Someone once told me that youth is a state of mind, that it is all about
remaining open-minded and young in spirit, accepting the youthful side
of yourself and giving it some freedom once in a while. 
 
All the silly candy raverisms like playing with toys, "worshipping"
cartoon figures, and dancing in public places are really the best thing
you can do to stay young. No wonder I like my Ninja Turtles backpack so
much. 

Peace and b-day grooves,

Ok, I mean absolutely no disrespect here:

I know K, I know what she wears and nobody jump on my back about fashion
not mattering, I'm just curious.  Clothes often do make the man or woman
:p  What do over 25 ravers wear?  I know some wear phat pants.  Do you?
How do I put this delicately?  I just can't imagine my mom (when I was 14)
wearing phat pants.  Do you dance?  Do you like candy raver things?  I
wonder if I'll be a raver after college.  Just a thought.

yeah, i was wondering about this.  why is it that we think so highly of
ourselves and our alleged plur ethic when most of us are mildly surprised
when we meet ppl older than college age in the scene?  (other than ppl who
make their livings off the industry)

i was talking to a girl a lot older than me at a club last weekend, and my
friend was taling shit about her like, oh she's too old to go to clubs.
and i disagree with him but still i know what he means - like, we expect
ourselves to grow out of this silly phase we're  in right now where we do
things that are fun.  why is this?

silly rabbit, trips are for kidz

plaid shirts. :)

to be honest i wear a colostomy bag and depends and try and rock shit with
my walker on the dancefloor.

*cough cough hack hack WHEEEEEZE*
hossam

(25, 26 in may and looking fwd to it.. its nice to have money and still be
able to have this much fun :)

you dont wake up and realise youve 'grown out of it' but you def. grow and
change as a person and thats where most of the changes in behavior stem
from (in my opinion)

OH! So that was YOU! They want to send you a bill; one of the little

I know, where would we go if we got old and were ostracized from the
group?!  Do you know that K was at my FIRST party?  She was so odd
looking.  Everyone was so odd looking!  I loved it!  I just wonder if
older ravers subscribe to the phat pants look or if they go for something
else.  What a thought!

	 *Clothes often do make the man or woman :p  What do over 25 ravers
wear?  I know some wear phat pants.  Do you? How do I put this delicately?  

	An interesting question. I'll be 27 in May (therefore the "sub pHunC
27" name for the party which I organize as a b-day party for myself). I
think Hossam's khaki's are a very cool idea. I've been wearing them several
times to parties. Along with a button down shirt (not tucked it though).
People sometimes give me weird looks. But oh well, I just am not into the
Polo/Hilfiger/Nautica look. 

	I think what you wear depends a lot on your background too. As Joe
(1.8.7.) pointed out in a post couple of weeks ago, the fashion trends are
very different in Europe and in North America. Being from Europe, I can tell
you that people there actually laugh at the baggy and the phat pants being
worn here. It's very easy to spot an American at a party because he stands
out due to the clothes he/she wears, and the style of dancing as well.
Normal, everyday clothing is usually worn, especially by the techno elite
(very similar trend among the techno crowd in Toronto exists as well).    

	*Do you dance?  

	Yes, but not always. Only if the music warrants it. Getting older
has it's disadvantages too.
	 
	*I wonder if I'll be a raver after college.  Just a thought.

	Well, depends on what do you define as a "raver". I personally do
not view myself as one. I do go to parties, but that's about that. I started
going to them before I went to college (in '87), and I am still going to
them 3 years after college...

	For the over 25 crowd here, is anyone a member of the
RAVER-GERIATRIC list by any chance (except Braden)? It's a very different
type of list where a lot of things, among which politics, gun control,
legalization of drugs, drug/party relationship, age distribution among party
goers and the likes are discussed. You need to be over 25 in order to be a
an active member, but a younger person is allowed as a passive observer too.

Hmm, this is a damn cool thread.  I certainly plan on raving until I'm 25
or so (I'm 19 now).  Back in seattle and san fran most (or at least A LOT)
of the ravers are in their early to mid 20.  The pittsburg/cleveland crowd
on the other hand seems to be comprised almost entirely of high school
kids with a few college kids thrown in.  

I have another question for you older ravers:  Do you guys still do drugs
at parties?  I don't look upon raving as a phase, but I do view my drug
use as a phase that I will go through and then quit.  Still I have a hard
time imagining raving but staying sober ALL of the time (honestly, after
having a few awesome E experience, could you still go to clubs/raves and
not ever indulge?).  Something I'll have to think about in the coming
years.

Also, have many of you gone from being ravers to being
producers/promoters/dj's/light gurus/etc?  I think I would get bored with
the scene if I didn't try to change it.  Maybe not tho, raving is
certainly great fun!

I think I'll be wearing phat pants for a LONG time.  It might look
ridiculous but I can never go back to tight jeans.  Khakis sounds doable
tho.

pEace,
jP

I don't think you are right about this.  I go to high school and see the
amount of people my age, and I think its a lost less than you see it as. 
I would say MAYBE half of the people at pgh parties are in high school.

Yeah . . . I mean, I might not wear BIG BIG pants for an extended period
of time, but I know I'm not going to be wearing normal sized pants for a
long time.

I seriously don't know what's gonig on with the pgh scene.  First we have
the Ghetto booty battle (if it happens or whatever) with some BIG name
DJS and a line-up like pgh hasn't seen for a long long time (if ever). 
Then comes Sub Phunc 27, with an incredible line-up again, unlike pgh
parties of the recent past.  THEN comes digital genesis with a huge brand
new space able to be used more and sasha and john digweed.  and now:

Intergalactic Circus.

Here's the info line summary:

atomc babies 
felix da housecat
richard humpty visions
picture and spice (I can't really understand this)
thomas michael
kevin 
dust 
7-up 
zemo 
joshua ryan

That is a sweet line up.  Since when did pgh start having raves like
this? :)

<< I certainly plan on raving until I'm 25 or so (I'm 19 now). The
pittsburg/cleveland crowd on the other hand seems to be comprised almost
entirely of high school kids with a few college kids thrown in.  >>
 
Well, some of you know this already, but I am 31 years old. I didnt start
"raving" until I was 23, because that is when parties were first introduced to
this part of the country, to my knowledge at least (1990). Before that, I just
clubbed and went to small after hours parties at people's houses where locals
would spin. It is now 8 years later, and I still go to parties, but not nearly
as much. And I DO think it is largely because of the age average. It is hard
to find people around my age to go with, so it is good to know that there are
some of you out there. I hate to reduce it to age this much, because I have
found, through becoming friends with MUCH younger people in the past year and
a half, that even though there is a basic developmental maturity difference,
common ground is definitely there for meaningful friendships that afford both
parties (no pun intended) to learn from one another, in MANY ways. 

 >> I have another question for you older ravers:  Do you guys still do drugs
 at parties? >>

Well, to be honest with you, I never really did any drugs at parties until
last year, around February. And dont ask my why I started, because I still am
not sure. However, even as that may be, I still only do drugs one out of every
four parties I go to. I just prefer to be sober most of the time for a few
reasons: 1) I go to raves and clubs to hear the music, dance and see my
friends, and I see doing any drugs as just a little extra bonus or treat every
once in a while to differ my experiences, and 2) I hate the week after a party
when I have done drugs... I am tired, cranky, my jaw and tongue are sore, and
I look like hell ;-)  I am a fully grown adult now (hehe) with a  professional
career (I am a teacher with a Phd) and do not have the time or the energy to
take the full impact of drugs, plus I would by lying if I said I didnt feel
just a little bit hypocritical about doing the drugs at all. I am supposed to
be a model for these kids, and although I am certainly not expected to be
perfect, I can't, with a clear conscience, be as effective as I can and need
to be while I am actively using recreational drugs. Other professions might be
more allowing of and less affected by the mood swings, etc. that go along with
(at least my experience of) drugs, but mine isn't. Since I am in the business
of guiding young children through young adults toward leading healthy, happy
and productive lives, I cant very well condone drug usage, and it would be
difficult to explain to my students why I use drugs, even as occasionally as
it is. My point is that while I do feel slightly guilty about hiding a side of
me from my students, at the same time everything that I do makes me "ME", and
I am grateful for some of the experiences and insights that drug experiences
have given me. (I just havent made a career out of it)

>>could you still go to clubs/raves and not ever indulge?>>

Absolutely. If recreational drugs fell off the face of the earth forever, I
wouldnt even think about them again. Not that I have anything against people
who DO them, its just that for ME, I have just as good a time without them,
its just a DIFFERENT sort of time WITH them. 
 
>>Also, have many of you have gone from being ravers to being
producers/promoters/dj's/light gurus/etc?  I think I would get bored with the
scene if I didn't try to change it.  Maybe not tho, raving is certainly great
fun!>>

I havent. I know many people who are and have become producers, promoters,
dj's etc., but I havent ever felt the need to change the scene, as you say. I
feel that I make a difference just by being there and spreading positive vibes
to all that I can. And also by me still showing up to parties, as long as I
have been going, does show that the scene is still worth the time and effort!
 
>>*Clothes often do make the man or woman :p  What do over 25 ravers wear?  I
know some wear phat pants.  Do you? How do I put this delicately? I think
Hossam's khaki's are a very cool idea. I've been wearing them several times to
parties. >>

It all depends on how I feel that night, actually. When I first started
"raving" (man, that term has ALWAYS sounded so CHEESY to me) I wore "club
clothes" to raves, but did sort of evolve to different clothes based solely on
comfort, considering that I would be there all night (all those suit jackets,
bustiers, miniskirts, etc. started to TORMENT me by 3am). I think I wear the
baggy pants just to be comfortable, but also to look good too, which I think
they do on many people. I am definitely no slave to fashion though, and I will
always wear what is comfortable, depending on the event. 
 
 >>	*Do you dance?  
 >>>> 	Yes, but not always. Only if the music warrants it. Getting older has
it's disadvantages too.

Yeah I agree!! Its getting harder to just dance for the hell of it. I have to
really feel a groove, or else I just bob my head and stuff ;-) 

>>For the over 25 crowd here, is anyone a member of the RAVER-GERIATRIC list
by any chance (except Braden)?>>

NO. I have never heard of the list. But maybe I SHOULD be though, because with
the exception of this thread, very few posts on THIS list catch my interest,
besides the posts for upcoming parties (no offense to anyone in particular).
Sorry for the extremely long reply post...but I really liked this subject, and
felt I had something to offer in the way of my reply. Thanks for reading!

I think pgh havin these because its summer.  Lest we forget over the
long, cold winter, the pittsburgh rave scene isn't quite as small as we'd
think.  It just seems to happen in a cycle.  A ton of People try their
hand at promoting, maybe one succeeds, and the others sort of fade away.
So we have lots of events for a while.   I can't say if this is good, bad
or neither.  
  
> Intergalactic Circus.

Interesting - did you get this a flyer, or hear it?  Who's promoting?

> picture and spice (I can't really understand this)

Maybe Friction and Spice the Speed Garage Duo?

BTW: I'm listening to KISS FM a UK pirate on real audio right now with JJ
Frost on the tables - ooooyeah!  There was just a commercial on with MC
Skibadee rappin' the lineup of the World Dance (a huge rave with every
huge jungle & hardcore dj playing), and then a public service announcement
about the dangers of speed.  Weird stuff.

As I said in the original post, I didn't want to offend anyone, although I
may have.  It's just a curious thing to me.  I've known K since my first
party and she wears the most outrageous things!  Have you ever seen her?
She's all spandex and shiny 80's shoes.  She plays with things like air
traffic control lights.  Her make up is also TOTALLY WILD!!!
I love her, though!  My boyfriend, who will be 30 this October, looks like
he's about 20 and he wears phat pants (that he actually made himself).
Hossam wears khakis.  I just wonder if some older ravers don't wear phat
pants just because of their generational gap.  Quite honestly, I can't
tell the difference between young ravers and old ravers (unless, of
course, they're 13)!

I wear phat pants to parties because they are so incredibly comfortable to
dance in.  Not only that, but they also look really neat.  Kind of like a
long flowing dress.  I think it makes a dancer look very fluid.  

Let's not have the arguement over whether or not this is a relevant topic.  
Please.

No offense taken .......it's opened up a good thread on here for once, and
I think we all know who K is.......but we also know that K is not the only
example of those of us over 25...............;-)
The fat pants R kewl....don't get me wrong....but raves are, and always
have been kind of a idividualistic fashion enverionment..........I like to see

all of the diff. in the ppl......whether it's the fat pants themselves or hats
or
the khaki's or whatever..........*smiles*
I totally agree on the fluidity that the baggies give in the motion of
dancing...
kinda gives ya no reason not to dance....as long as the person keeps
moving, the style still looks good..........and ravers like to look good ;-)
what else is a rave about if not to smile, have fun, go nuts bein' yo bad
self,
and look good doin it....hahahaha
& these "old bones" just aren't ready to give up that yet.
definately a relevant topic

Well this statement depends upon where you go to the rave/party. Since we were
referring earlier to the age of the "ravers" at the parties being so young,
and party-goers individuality vs. dressing alike, this might be something to
think about: The fact that the current increase of attendees being so young
(ages 10-17), correlates with the fact that they have a tremendous need to
"belong", and therefore, want to look like everyone else in order to belong
(in their socially underdeveloped minds). Thus, the phat pants etc. would be
one way that everyone could participate in the standard uniform of the rave,
at least in that person's particular area or region. Individuality has always
been something that people would like to have, it connotates
independence/leadership, spotlight/attention, and confidence. Unfortunately,
too many times, people that go to raves, like I said, dont WANT (or are
afraid) to stand out, and therefore try to "fit in" as much as possible, and
there you have the mass numbers of people in JNCO's, etc. (Remember the
pajamas and sleeping bags??)  Now this is not including the fact that these
clothes might just be the most comfortable things to wear, but I am just
commenting on what I am seeing at parties in the last 3 years or so.  Back in
the club days, it was the "fashion" to dress as crazy/silly as possible, with
NO emphasis on comfort.  (boy am I glad THAT has changed, though it WAS fun to
see the array of characters around 2am) ;-) Anyway, just some random
thoughts...FIRE AT WILL... ;-)

I just have one question for the whole huge pants crew... how is it
possible to wear those 49" cuffs? I can't see anyone walking in those
things... let alone dancing in them. 

	There comes to a point when enough is enough and you just start looking
silly.

 just my 2c

My perspective as a raver has gone through a sort of evolution over the
years.  When I was 15 it seemed like almost everyone was older than me.
Now I'm 21 and it seems like everyone is younger.  This is just my
impression - i really think I'm about the average age.  When your out of
highschool, half of the ravers being in highschool does seem like alot!
I know in HS i could only go to a rave every two months if i was lucky
because of no money, no ride, or not enough events.

I have to say, i do prefer big pants, especially for dancing, and the
airflow they provide, and in general ability to hold more in pockets,
etc...I'v destroyed a couple pairs that weren't big enough coz they
couldn't take my brock'd-out dance maneuvers. :)

Still, i think there's lots of room for variety and comfort in ravin' gear
- trust me you can rave without JNCOs!  I'v worn the pjs, garbage bags,
plastic hazard pants, jockey pants (not recommended for airflow, but they
are stylin'), and numr'us pairs of 'bignuff pants and had groovin' fun
every time.

As for ravin'...i dunno i think i'll keep it up as long as there's good
sounds and the beats move me...while i enjoy other parts of
the scene, thats' all i really need to make me happy.  But who can say
what things'll be like in 10 or even 5 years - i make think differently
then.

l8s,
 cutup - the raver left at home

Hey everybody....


    Well, after I just got done telling everyone how I had everything
ready to go for april foolz II tonight in the Poconos, I find out that
IT'S SOLD OUT! Yep. I know what everyone is saying, '...but the place
holds 8,500 people!' That was my reaction too, but that's coming
straight from the infoline...

    Listen, if ANYBODY has ANY extra tickets for any reason (friends
canceled out, got more presales than you needed 'just in case', found
them on some bum in the street, whatever...), please help me (and
however many of my 3 buds) out if you can... I would appreciate it more
than words could ever describe.

    I'll be checking my email all day or if anybody wants to call me, my
number is 724.727.7614 (ask for spike). Thanks in advance to everybody
and hopefully I'll see lots of you down there tonight....


    PLUR...

Okay, I haven't read my email in a couple days and you guys really went
crazy on this topic, so bear with me as I try to answer a few of your
questions/comments . . .

Right on! That is one thing that is so cool about the rave scene!

Hehehe. First, just remember that "older" ravers are not at all like
your Mom. Moms have to preserve a certain amount of dignity, and be
perceived as an authority figure. I, at least, try to tone that down for
the parties. Now I don't your Mom personally, but if you ever saw your
Mom outside of her "mom" role maybe you wouldn't be so surprised to see
her in phat pants. Many times, Mom's just need to re-find that youthful
part of themselves. 

It took me a while to imagine myself in phat pants, but now I always
wear them to parties and at home. I don't always wear them out to
non-rave functions because I have a wardrobe full of other cool clothes,
too, but most of my jeans are baggy, even when not phat. 

I have always liked the phat pants style, and once I wore a pair I fell
in love with the comfort. I look young enough that it doesn't look
ridiculous (I hope! Someone please tell me when it does!). The one thing
I live in fear of is being one of those old wrinkly ladies wearing the
clothes of a 16 year old and trying desperately to feel young. So, I
have pretty much decided I WILL have to get some clubby style clothes
some day. But they are not very practical for dancing as most of them
make you sweat too much. 

As for other older ravers, I know many of them do not wear phat pants.
Whether that is from discomfort with the idea or simply not digging the
style depends on the individual.

Yeah, I went to the Winter Techno Music Conference in Miami this year
for the first time and the phat pants look was definitley NOT in
evidence. And its not just the pants, its your shoes, too. Even when I
wore baggy street pants, I stuck out at the convention and parties
because of my addidas shoes. Most of the parties were in clubs. I was
one of only about 3 ppl that looked like a "raver." The bouncers at some
of the clubs wouldn't let me in because of the way I was dressed, so I
missed Tony Humphries and a couple other good shows. This kind of
discrimination made me MAD!!! 

Most of the time I didn't feel uncomfortable, hell I actually felt PROUD
(becuase I was one of the few there to really DANCE!) but I will
definitely be shopping for a few clubbier outfits for next year. 

> Do you dance?  

I guess I just answered that. HELL YEAH! When I sit behind a desk 50+
hours a week all I want to do is dance when I hear good music. Getting
older does not have to mean you get tired earlier or don't like to dance
as much. Most of that misperception seems to me to come from ppl who
have never tried raving _without_ drugs (though I'm sure it is a highly
individual thing). You have to learn how to let the music flow through
you and how to get high off your own brain chemicals. I have been known
to dance for 6-8 hours straight if the music is good. I don't go to
parties to socialize as much (though I definitely do anyway). I go to
DANCE. I KNOW I will be dancing when I am 95. Dancing keeps you young
(and it's good exercise)! 

> Do you like candy raver things?  

Sure! When I first started going to parties in the early 90's, it was
cool to dress in costumes or wear pajamas or glitter (at least at
parties in Omaha -- we were a little slow). I used to wear glitter and
toys and costumes, but now I don't have so much time to spend getting
"glamourous." 

I have been hauling around the now infamous Ninja Turtles backpack for
two years. Time for a new backpack! One of the greatest feelings is when
some little kid comes up and is ooohing and aaaahing over the ninja
turtles. Their parents prolly think me weird, but even my Mom had to
admit it was fun when this happened once when she and I were shopping.
Retaining your appreciation for childhood things is one of the best
things you can do to remain young at heart.

A milestone for me was the night I used a pacifier for the first time. I
still feel ridiculous using one but it works for its intended purpose!
Vicks masks too, if that's your thing. 

A photographer tried to take my picture at Family Affair last year while
I was dancing and sucking on my pacifier. Boy was she surprised when I
nearly ripped the camera out of her hand to avoid getting my picture
taken! Just didn't want to be immortalized with a pacifier in my mouth!
Hehehhe.

Damn, sonny! I been looking for a boy like you with some gumption all my

wind dam and hydrofoils. How about yours? ;->


For those of you who have made it this far, Joel brought up a good
point:

I think if ppl stop categorizing other ppl according to age there is a
point where you "trancend' all that and it no longer matters. It
happened to me about 2 years ago. Now, I will cheerfully party with 14
year olds and 45 year olds all night long and never feel the need to
categorize a party based on what age group seems predominant. I honestly
don't notice! Most ppl have a hard time with this, but keep an open mind
about it becuase if you can learn to let go of that "label," parties,
and nearly every other life activity become a lot more enjoyable. You
don't have to waste time feeling too old or too young or whatever, you
just ARE and you feel a much deeper involvement in it. Suddenly you'll
be surprised at how much you have in common with someone of another age
group. 

Joel again:
> I have another question for you older ravers:  Do you guys still do drugs

> use as a phase that I will go through and then quit.  

I HOPE for most ppl experimenting with every drug out there is just a
phase. If you love the music and you're surrounded by friends, both
known and unknown, what more do you need? It is possible to get high on
the music! I actually find I can stay up later and party harder drug
free (with the help of a little caffeine and a well-placed nap). Drugs
wear your body and mind down. I definitely do not mean to sound like I'm
preaching, this is just an observation based on 20 years of partying. 

Having said that, an older raver I know does occassionally see the
desireability of a little E for special occasions. ;->

Joel again:

I haven't gotten bored with it after 7 years but I love it so much I am
driven to contribute to it in addition to partying. So, last year I
started High-R Frequencies magazine, which covers the underground dance
scene in the Midwest. A few copies have made their way out Ohio/Penn way
through distributioon at Family Affair and some other parties. (Your
very own LemonLyman wrote an article on the Swedish Techno producers for
the last issue!) I hope to be able to start distributing in Cleveland
and Columbus regularly starting with the next issue (due out in May or
June), cuase there is so much happening there, and cause I STILL  feel
like I am FROM Cleveland. So keep your eyes peeled. I will announce it
on this list.

It's great to have an more "official" function and I have learned sooo
much about the scene, the artists and the whole process of making music.
So far, I haven't gotten that "Emerald City" syndrom where everything
looks shiny and bright until you go behind the scene and see what the
wizard (raves) really looks like. I already had accepted that there are
bad elements to the scene. High-R Frequencies is my attempt to promote
what is positive about the scene. 

Well, granny is getting ready for her nap, kiddies so I better wrap this
up, hehehe. 

See you on the dancefloor,
(I will be hitting a couple Columbus parties on Memorial DAy weekend.
Come up and say Hi! Look for my Ninja Turtles backpack with flashing red
light on top, I'm sure I'll still have it then.)

Right on, girl! Especially those REALLY wide bottom pants. I love the
way they look too! (Though I must admit I had a hard time figuring out
how they were supposed to fit when buying my first couple pairs. ;-> )

This is the objectionable post:
*** Miss Mary had a steam boat the steam boat had a bell
***
*** Hey there operator connect me to number 9 if you disconnect me i `ll
*** kick you from be hind
***
*** Clap With me {{{Static}}}

Just so you know, your posts are now very much like "the little boy who
cried wolf" because you are officially being automatically trashed and
when you eventually DO have something important to say, unfortunately you
will not be heard.

The sad thing is that neither I nor anyone else on this list should
HAVE to ignore another member.  Expecially since this is a somewhat
"closed" list.   Shameless attempts at being the daily center of attention
are getting old.  No wonder our scene seems to be headed toward the
gutter sometimes... GROW UP.

I gotta say, being on this list was THE BEST THING that EVER happened
to me!  I mean everyone dissed my SENILITY problem with the parties,
I thought I would get hate mail!

Instead, and I sorta knew, everyone is like Hey!  I am almost that
age, and Kali for Prez, and I even got a BIRTHDAY CARD RIGHT HERE
ON THE LIST!

I am glad you Promoters are out there, and I am more than happy to
well, MAKE YOU HAPPY  :)  Good new with my Birthday, now I can't 
promise, may or may not happen, but for the tapes, MAYBE I will
get a Mini-disk, no more of the Amateur sound, you know what I mean!

The covers are made by computer, and the tape I am making now, which
won't be ready any time soon, will HAVE A GLOW IN THE DARK COVER!

The title is Yin and Yang.  First side is X-tremely Dark Evil Nasty
Hardcore.  The other side is Softer, more like you could Ice Skate
to it if ya wanted, (though I am not sure that would go over too
well at the next Winter Olympics)  It is a lot of older stuff, stuff
when Raves were just starting here in Pittsburgh.  Let us just say
it was like a Trip Down Memory Lane!  ("See it IS age!"  OH QUIET AND
GET BACK TO YOUR QUILTING!")  

Anyway, it gives you not only how evil Hardcore had gotten, but how
basic and fun it all really is!  :)

For those of you who hate Hardcore, uh, ok.  Ignore Me!

Peace Out,
DJ KALI  (Happy Birthday for anyone else out there whose Birthday
is coming up!!!)

Everyone keeps mentioning the "clubber" look.  I'm dumb, will someone please

Still, can't believe this, I mess up the dates of 2 important events,
screw up what Promoter throws what, and the only thing I get is
COMPLETE NICE-NESS!!!  Do you realize that sometimes in the EVIL
CORPORATE WORLD  this kinda thing goes on the BAD EMPLOYEE REPORT?
"You messed up the meeting between Bob Blob for Blobby Bubbles and
Roy Shmoy Sunny Shrooms!!!  You told everyone Bob Blob does Shrooms
and Roy Shmoy Blows Bubbles!!!"  You get the idea.

So far, I had just the kindest comments on my age, pHryL nicely and
very politely setting me straight and wanting tapes, and I HAVE TO
MAKE UP FOR MY ERROR!  But no one so far has said "HEY KALI YOU 
F*** C*** THAT DATE WAS MY PARTY HOW DARE YOU SAY THE 16TH IS THIS
WHEN EVERYONE ON THIS LIST KNOWS IT AIN'T THAT!"  Not once have I
gotten a message NO!  I DON'T WANT ONE LIKE THAT I REALLY REALLY
DO NOT THAT AIN'T MY POINT!

Point is, everyone looks at us going to these all night events, looking 
all different, being who and what we are and being snooty snobs, they 
say "Oh, those RUDE IMBECILES dancing all night, DOING THOSE THINGS LIKE 
DRUGS, AND WHO KNOW WHAT ELSE!  I am glad my Kid
doesn't do that and stays in Boarding School away from those HORRIBLE
PEOPLE!"

Well, I would like to challenge (too bad I am not working) but I am
saving these messages for a reference to people my age and whoever who
tries to look down on us and see for themselves WHAT RUDE IMBECILES
REALLY ARE!  I would like some snotty snobs make a BIG ERROR kinda like 
I did on whatever site they have and just see who is the most
forgiving.  Chances are, the Snooty Snob Site would cuss 'em out
write a report and fax it to their Snooty Snobby club!  It would be
posted EVERYWHERE!!!  "Melinda has just made a TOTAL ASS of herself as 
usual stating that she has her Birthday the same day as THE GOLF 
FESTIVAL!  Silly B**** doesn't know that is not the date, but the date
of the Best Looking Tennis Racket, and that we know that goes to Gary 
Get-A Life Already the VII."

So, for those out there who feel sad because someone just by walking 
down the street you darkened their day by wearing RAVE GEAR etc., 
remember someone told them all wrong!  Fit in, Do what others do, do not 
be yourself, be part of a team, do not be creative... blah blah
They are actually hurting themselves!  

So Thanks for being nice to me out there, 'cause living here in the
Brentwood Zone I need it!!!   :)

Peace Out,
DJ KALI

Greetings Fashion Folks!  This is her Trampiness DJ Kali for that
how shall we say, OVER 25 and STILL RAVING group.  Heavens!  It is
1998 already!  When I started to Rave it was 1992, and I was 29.  

What to do?  Well, I had the best fashion advice at the kind folks
at Pegasus, if you are not familiar with Pittsburgh, yes, it is a
gay club, and the best dance floor you have ever seen!  3 Tier floor
nice lights, fruity drinks, ah, just like yesterday....  OH!  Fashion 
yes!

How many of you dress "Standard Rave Gear?"  ok.  "Imaginative, but
not Practical for dancing?"  ok.  "Who gives a damn, and I look like a 
'Ho!"  me!  oops!  uh, ok. now.

So, how many of you "Standards" are under 25?  uh huh.  Over?  ok.
"Imaginative"  I see.  and "'ho"  we all know who that is.

Ok, now what works best for you?  For those who like to dance, I would 
say Standard gear is best for Breaks, something about those super-wide 
pants gives Break dancing a Unique flair!  Those cute scuffly feet, and 
spins on the floor, I highly recommend Standard in all those type of 
Circly Situations.  

For those who like to walk and talk, and dislike to dance and prance
Imaginative is A DEFINATE for you!  Just imagine breaking up the mundane 
atmosphere with a KILLER OUTFIT!  One with a Billion Feathers
like such:  THE MANIAC AT THE MARDI GRAS!  Or how about this theme?
THE CAMELOT CONTEMPORARY Look?  Or if you were back in 1992 CMU
Architectural Hall Rave - MARIE ANTOINETTE IN VIENNA Look?  Simply
fabulous for those who dislike having their nice outfits all sweaty
and makeup everywhere.

Now for you (you know who you are)  The "Go as a 'ho look.  Well,
I have this to say.  You like to dance.  Yes indeedy, but do not do
the Break dancing very well.  Probably one of those HARDCORE 'Hos' back 
in Deadly Budas' day am I right?  I must admit I am sure you feel
inferior because well, you just can't carry the Standard look, too
awkward if not break dancing.  No way are the Imaginative costumes
any good they would be wrecked by all that Trance Dancing and I would
hate to see the cleaning bill to get all that sweat off of them, not to 
mention feathers flying and lace everywhere!  So you did the next
best thing.  You got STRETCHY STUFF.  Body suits, excercise pants,
for that tight fit, and to top it off, you sorta do go Imaginative
by decorating your hair and makeup for that night.  In other words
Old Skool still Rules for you who remember the God Forbid '80's.

Now, I have seen this too in Fashion Fun world, the GLAMOUR LOOK you
know the re-visit the '20s' '30's '40's '50's and so on.  Fabulous
darlings, just sooo fabulous!!!

Now about age.  WHAT AGE?  DANCE! WALK, TALK, RE-LIVE RE-VITALIZE
ANYTHING YOU DARING DARLINGS OF THE DARK!!!  WHATEVER THE MOVE, MAY
YOU ADD ON OR ALREADY IMPROVE!!!   ;)

Your Funny Fashion Fool,
DJ KALI

HEY!  DID ANYONE SEE MY FALSE TEETH ON THE FLOOR?  SPEAK UP CAN'T
HEAR YA!  WHA'D YA SAY?  WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST ASK ANYWAY?

Me when I am 80 years old and STILL HAVE THE VIBE  maybe by then
I'll be rich and famous and throw damn good parties, may not remember
them, so I'll make sure the Video monitors are on and I can Trance
Out daily in the old mansion!  ;)  What the heck, maybe I'll still be 
dancing and DJ'ing there is always hope!

Ok, underage people (that means U under 35)  raise your hand!  Ok.
Now how many of you plan to do "Recreational Substances?"  Ok., no
that is fine.  NO, HEY, FREE CHOICE IN THE CLASS ROOM WE ARE ALL
ADULTS (Young) ANYWAY, SO NONE OF THIS ANTI ANYTHING STUFF!

How many DJ already?  uh huh.  Promote.  Great!  Welcome everyone!

Todays lesson (Yes it is ok for the older crowd to take notes if you
rememberd to BRING ANYTHING BEING SOOO OLD AND ALL!)  Amazing some
of these people remembered their Website!  Ok now class this todays
lecture on "Whatever Shall I Do When I Become Their Age!"

Well, I have to be honest.  I never tried anything to get me in the
mood to dance.  I never needed it. That is just me, and I have known
people who tried things, but that doesn't bother me.  Just be careful
kids of what you put in your mouths, I mean, don't use yourself like
Mrs. Hicks chemistry set.  I mean some things just don't mix well with
other things, and you might get very sick and not feel very good.  Then 
you gotta bother your pals for a ride, or maybe need a ride you
really don't want like to the hospital.  Just a warning no lecture.
Just play safe ok?  

You Danced Yourself in a Trance is there life After?  Yes, why not?
Save up for some Turntables or music equipment, drive yourself crazy
making that song or set, AND BOTHER PEOPLE WITH IT, anyone!  Your mom,
dad, Promoters, people on this site!  Anybody anyone will do!  
Magazines, etc.  Local Record shop!

Promote and don't be shady!  Rule 1.  Start small.  Be big on the first 
try and get a Migraine.  Do small things first.  Your new, haven't 
really done it before, so take your time.  Choose a space
and if you don't know how contact me I'll get ya in good with some
folks.  (I won't mess up the date I promise!)

What else?  What about art?  Doing some Murals is a plus!  But not
in the space that is called Vandalism and it isn't polite. What about 
classes in Art?  Or make stuff to sell? 

Open a Store!  Jewelry, clothes, and it doesn't have to be like anyone
elses!  Do whatever maybe get a job that you don't care much for first 
to get the money to get the stuff to sell to get the store, to get more 
stuff to sell to make the money to keep the store, to buy more
stuff and make more money...etc.

Well, hope that is a help.  Me?  My 1/2 hour is up and my brain is
going to sleep now....

DJ KALI

EXACTLY!!!  I was so shy when I was little, that people actually marveled
at the fact that I could speak.  I only spoke to my one or two friends at
school.  I never spoke to strangers.  I couldn't stand to make to friends!
No wonder I was a late bloomer.  I didn't start being outgoing until I was
at least 17.  I didn't start going to raves until i was 17.  Hmmm, anyone
see a connection?  
I wasn't very touchy-feely as a child.  I hated when people touched me,
even if it was just to shake hands.  I didn't even like my family hugging
me.  Now, I hug just about everyone I see!  It's really weird the
transition I've made because of raving.  I don't think it's a matter of
growing up and out of a shy phase.

 year olds and 45 year olds all night long and never feel the need to
 categorize a party based on what age group seems predominant. I honestly
 don't notice! Most ppl have a hard time with this, but keep an open mind
 about it becuase if you can learn to let go of that "label," parties,
 and nearly every other life activity become a lot more enjoyable. You
 don't have to waste time feeling too old or too young or whatever, you
 just ARE and you feel a much deeper involvement in it. Suddenly you'll
 be surprised at how much you have in common with someone of another age
 group.  >>

{{Clap, clap, clap...(much applause)}}}  WELL STATED.... I couldnt agree
more... this is why I havent felt the need to recognize my age in the past,
say, 10 or so years...

WOW!!

I don't think it would be impossible to dance in 69".  I think it depends
on how you dance.  Do they sell kikwear in Pittsburgh?  I've never seen
it.  Where can you get those pants (can you tell I'm an inch whore)?  I so
want big pants like those.  The sheer size makes me giggle!  I WANT A PAIR
OF THESE PANTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Denim shortage!!!  I want to house
several small children.  I want to camp out in my pants.  Wahoo!!!!!!!!!!!

"Culture Shock" -- it was small and unpublicized, but Damn!  Haven't had this
much fun in months.  People were at their absolute friendliest, there was a
wide variety of ages, and my little brother picked up two girls (Eeek!
Yikes!)

P.S. -- Does anyone other than me think it's just not right for a 17-year-old

Well, morally, societally, historically, and religiously speaking, its
probably not considered "right", because of all of the emotional, physical and
societal consequences, but technically, at long as he/she is using a condom or
other protection and not being a dickhead to the people they are sleeping
with, then experimenting isnt a bad thing. The key is to recognize that there
is obviously a need being filled there, (other than the obvious physical
need), an emotional one that the person doesnt feel they can fill anyway else
at the time, and maybe never will (my dad is 56 and is still that way ;-)
Consider all of the psychologists who have commented on why this happens
(Freud and/or Erikson with the psychosexual stages of development, and getting
stuck in just one haunts the person the rest of their life: anal, oral,
phallic, etc.)...Just wanted to answer the question as best as I could think
of... [How this is rave related...to those of you who just cant figure out how
it can be tied: Raves...social atmosphere...meet possible sexual
partners...mix with drugs or other good feelings being spread around...a
little extra time or a dark corner...BOOM!!] hehehe...j/k   PEACE, everyone...

sup everybody?

most of you know a little bit about me already, but just cause im
replyin to this email: 

i found out about raves many years ago from the hyperreal web page
which lead me to this list. i went to a rave and fell in love. it was
really hard to go to them cause i was so young, but i managed, and
about 2 years ago started getting permission from my parents to go
(before that it was all about sneaking out and all dat). i've been
going to about 1 a month for the last 2 years and i just cant get
enuff of that good wholesome ravey goodness. the reason i became a dj
is probably the same reason almost any other dj became a dj. during
these past several years, i've been blown away by all of that amazing
music that is bein spun... i've been on dancefloors jam-packed with
vibe, and the dj is the guy at the root of that vibe. i can't even
wait till i'm spinnin @ a rave with a large crowd of headz goin
brock-wild! 

anyways, as far as my future goes, i'll be going to college the year
after next, and i'll definitely keep it up thru college, no doubt. by
then, i hope to be a good enuff dj so that i can spin regularly @
clubs/raves/parties/etc in whatever city i move to. after college, who
knows? i don't think there's much of a chance of me becoming a
superstar dj or anything, so ill probably end up with some sorta
post-college job. i am pretty sure that i'll still have the same love
for the music + the vibe + all, but who knows, cause both the rave
scene and i will have changed quite a bit by then, i imagine. it is
funny to imagine myself married in 20 years and have a set of tech 12s
in the living room, with me bustin' out the old jump-up up rekkids to
re-live the days of old :) :) 

as for the use of recreational substances, for the time being,
whichever i choose to use, i find an excellent addition to the already
excellent raving experience. i hope to continue to use them at a rate
where it wont affect me to the point where i dont want to use them any
more (which happens to so many people as they get older). the way i
look at it is that if you "have" to stop using a drug, you've mis-used
it, either taking it too often, with no purpose, in too high of
dosages, in the wrong combination with other drugs, for the wrong
reasons, etc., etc. im saying that i hope to continue this for the
upcoming years of my life, because for the time being, it adds a sense
of oneness/all dat to specific raves i go to, and raves in general, as
well as my life as a whole. if i grow out of the drug phase, and can
still feel that connection, i'll be just as happy... probably more
happy if i still love it to the extent that i do now.

anyways, as long as im ramblin': how about all of these bomb-ass big
scale raves we've got coming up? i'm siced as a mofo! i'm hoping they
all go off well and the promoters can start focusing on whats really
important (bringing in uk jungle djs and mcs :) hehehe just kiddin.

keep ravin, dancin, spinnin, promotin, and readin yo emails...

If you look, though a lot of that is kind of fading away.  I mean there
are still individuals with their own shit, but a lot of it is just people
gonig out and buying the latest tommy h and nautica. (not to dis tommy h
or nautica, cause some of their shit rocks, but a lot of it is just a
follow the crow/popularity kind of thing)

No doubt.

>what else is a rave about if not to smile, have fun, go nuts bein' yo
bad self,

Yeah, but again, the same people that i mentioned above that aren't being
themselves, feel that dancing and going buckwild is a stupid thing to do
and just makes a fool of yourself.  There's nothing worse than stuck up
ravers :)

There needs to be more people out there just to have fun, cause that is
what ravings all about.

Good point.  Regardless of everything . . . it looks like a good summer
to come :)

>Interesting - did you get this a flyer, or hear it?  Who's promoting?

I got a flyer at hypervinyl and it has an info line on it which is
355-8425.

In the corners it lists the people invovled and they are: 5 star (I think
this is zemo and 7-up . . . anyone know?), linear loop (?), and down low
communications (eric d and I've also heard the redheaded stepchild anyone
have any more info?)

	Forgive me if I get all nostalgic.  It's a nasty habit that I
picked up somewhere along the way of growing up.  Has anyone heard any
rumors about any renegades this summer?  Specifically under the West end
Bridge?  I've heard rumors that stickman is gone.  I know that Joe is
gone.  I don't know who else comprises the Jive Turkeyz.  I'm going to be
very sad if there are no renegades this summer (especially in that 
specific spot!).  
	Does anyone else remember those parties?  Do you remember the
Josta truck just showing up and giving out free cans?  Do you remember
standing around in the dirt?  Do you remember the river and the boats.
I'd better stop, now, before I start to mourn for my lost innocence.

considering the jive turkeyz:
Rick moved to Florida with his family...
Joe is of course in Philadelphia, and Eric moved there over a year ago...
opus has gone off into his own slinky world

i think that's about it, but anyone can do a party on that street-- it
doesn't take anything more than a generator, two tables, a mixer and a
effective enough sound system.

someone should do it up.

nope... you're wrong about that one, cause that IS what raving is
supposed to be all about, no matter how little it has to do with that
nowadays...

So, if you think I'm so wrong, then what is why do you think raving is
all about?

I'm not trying to be smart or anything, but I'm confused as to how you
could disagree that going to raves is about having fun.

What do you go for . . . The pleasant relaxing ambiance?  The serious
political issues that are dealt with?

 . . . . huh . . .

:)  Yeah yeah!  Pgh renegades have been some of the wickedest shit that
I'v been to.  While they're never too illegal, they'r always an
adventure.  Remember that night when there were military helocopters
flying around pittsburgh and people were freaking out thinking it was
UFO's or something...then that night Adair (who I'd never seen spin
before) played "the helocopter tune"? :)  Just the whole atmosphere is
what i really want to have at a rave....magical, special, a little
dangerout, and not pre-packaged to sell ya.  I think raves, in the
years of late, have lost some things I thought they'd standup
straighter for - our personal freedom, our tribal roots, and against
the tyranny of "the way things ought to be".  Renegades at lest give
show a twinkling of this stuff...

PS: Josta people were some of the most popular kids in pittsburgh that
summer - i must of gotten a case worth of free cans from them at various
times.

Here's a review of April foolz, prolly doesnt have the information you
really wanted to know about it, but that's a reflection on what I found out
myself :)

First off, there were no tickets available for purchase in pittsburgh cause
the lamers never mailed them to the ticket shop. The On-line (and telephone
callin) ticket allocation was sold out. The At the door tickets were NOT
sold out. So we went without tickets and bought them at the door.

I got there at 7:30pm, there was no one supervising parking other than
pointing you off of the main road, so I knew I was gonna get parked in... I
wondered into the lodge, thinking the rave was there, and saw some security
guard shouting at some ravers sitting in the lobby telling them they would
have to leave. The kids showed him thier keys and said they had a room, and
were waiting for thier friends... the guard told em he didnt care they'd
have to leave... I thought Damn... if I'd payed for a room I'd expect to be
able to chill in the lobby... but whatever... I finally found the line for
the convention center at like 7:45. I got in line and asked the dude in
front of me how long he'd been there, he said since 5pm... I was like "how
the hell have you been in line for 3 hours and you're still at the end?" he
said people had been cutting in line and the event staff kept pushing the
line back. by 11pm I knew what he was talking about... yeah I stood in line
for 3 hours, when I got there I was like 20 feet from the door, at like 10pm
I was over 100feet from the door. Fucked up no? They had no fucking
organization what so ever... to top it off, there was a skunk loose that
kept terrorizing the right side of the line... fucker sprayed somewhere you
could smell it... we told the event dudes... thinking they may call some
sort of an animal control person but they didnt... Finally I got really
fucking pissed off at like 10:30 and went and cut in front of like 1.5k
people and got in at like 11pm. (The event staff took my water bottle at the
door).
there were 6 urinals and 6 stools for all 8.5k people... heh so as soon as I
got out of the 3 hour wait in line to get inside I went into the 30minute
wait to take a piss

It was probably between 130 and 140 degrees inside. no exageration. Standing
still, I was dripping with sweat. all of my clothing was soaked. The room
could probably hold 5k people and they had 8.5k people in there. I'd
describe it as a 1-room event. Yeah they had 2 rooms that would have been
put to better use as coat-check rooms that were the jungle and hard-core
rooms. but it was at least 30 degrees warmer in them... yeah it was like 160
to 180 in the jungle room. The girl I was with in there passed out and I
carried her out. At like 1:30 I'd decided I'd had enough, so my friend and I
went and sat in the back corner as close as we could get to an open door. It
was really wierd how muggy and hot it was in there... soon as I sat down tho
it got like 30degrees cooler... was like maybe 90 or 100 if you sat down,
you could hold your hand up and feel the 130 to 140 degrees heat tho. We sat
there for like 2 hours, and the heat kept getting lower and lower... at like
3:30 It was so low that you hadda lay down to get under the heat level... at
that time I was like fuck it, I dont care if I'm parked in, I'll just sit in
the car for 3 hours till I can get out. IT didnt seem like heat was the main
problem tho, I just couldnt breathe... It seemed like there just wasn't
enough oxygen in there. There were no fans, and only a couple of doors open.
If you went to Cheers and thought it was hot before they allowed re-entry,
try imagining that times 3.

At any rate... as for the music... for like 10 minutes I was right before
the stage and it was nice and clear and it rocked :) but when I went toward
the back of the room all I could hear was muffled echoes. it was really
quiet... my friend said the sound reminded him of Terminal Velocity. I
thought it was worse... The light show sucked ass. G-Spot and any House of
styles event had more lights and they just plain looked better. I think
G-Spot had more sound wattage too.

Well, there's not much info about music in this review cause I didnt' hear
much that I could make out.

Sorry for my second negative review in a row... I guess I have bad luck when
I travel out of town... I dont think I'll be going out of town for a rave
for a LONG ass time.

For a positive note, among the kids there, PLUR was in effect :)

Dan

Has anyone seen the new Gap commercials?

The first one I saw was comprised of Crystal Method's "Busy Child" and
bladers and skaters...in khakis. Slogan: khakis rock

The second one I saw was comprised of breakers breaking to groovy stuff.
Slogan: khakis groove

hmmmmmm.

DJZ here in dorktown ....  errrr youngstown (niles/boardom) sell them at
the hefty price of 80$....   ouch.

i dunno if i'd ever get into them.   a interesting note is there are
DRAWSTRINGs on the cuffs so you can pull them in and look like hammer in
CANT TOUCH THIS circa '91  ....   well minus the shiny gold rather in denim.

The Rave Scene is an Artistic Movement.  These aren't some lil' teenybopper
mixers.  Try some frat parties.  I hear they're pretty "FUN".  I go because
the music, the fashion, and just the whole idea of the scene are so fuckin
artistically awesome and cool.  If they weren't, I wouldn't be there.  Period.
And I hope not many other people would be either.  To me that means raves are
about art.

I'm sorry that these replies were so cutting.  I don't mean to disrespect you.
I just sort of had to sacrifice politeness for effectiveness. =)

Does it really matter what raving means to us individually.  Should you
really be telling someone that raving should be about fun to them?  No one
has the right to dictate, to the masses, what they should believe.  If
raving means fun to you, congratulations.  If raving means art to him,
hallelujah!  Raving is spiritual to some, drugs to others.  Who cares?
Raving is escape to me and shelter to you.  So what?  I can't quite
believe that we're having this discussion yet AGAIN.

<DING DING DING!> Good answer, good answer. Now do you wanna try the bonus
question for the matching Beaver Down Toothbrush and Toaster?

Doesn't the 'artistic' essence of raving go hand-in-hand with the fun of
it?  IE: if ravin' had the same raw artistic elements, yet if it wasn't
fun, would it still be ravin?  It is all personal, no doubt.  I see the
art and 'fun' (pleasingly experiential...hard to really catagorize)
aspects of ravin' to be intertwined in a way that creates the emergent
property that makes it enjoyable.  Without either it would be something
less.

To me raving is about getting free snackcakes.  Sadly, I'm always
disappointed. :P.

 I did this track for one reason.  I had a big discussion with a DJ, a
 Rave/techno DJ that is, I just told him that I think that 90% of the
 Techno releases are made in 2 hours pr. track.  and that I basically dont
 think that it's very hard to do a good rave track. I mostly did it just to
 provoke him a little, he is one of those DJ's that feel's that Musicians
 are tools of DJ's, hehe.  And he said, "OK, let's see you do a good rave
 track in 2 hours", and I did.  The title is just another little message to
 that DJ.

This reminds me: I have a question to post to the list in general.

How many people would be into coming to a show that featured both
industrial bands and drum&bass/techno djs or acts?   Why do i ask?  For
one, I'm considering teaming up with some local industrial promoters to do
such an event.  They're trying to bring the act Haujobb to town - their
music is more or less dark techno with techstep influences.  In addition
we're considering getting some dark jungle or techno djs/live acts, and
another 'industrial dj' to round it out.  The whole thing would probably
be a weeknight show at somewhere like Laga.  

To me, I think this would be a fun, unique event that would bring together
two groups that share alot in common, but have very little interaction.  
If it doesn't seem like people will come, its not worth doing the show and
loosing money on it.  So what are people's thoughts?

have a phun one,
 cutup

Silly, renegade implies illegal!  When people have block parties, it's
usually a party for the BLOCK, you know, as in neighborhood.  Since we
don't all live in the same neighborhood, let alone same city/state, it
might be difficult.  When you block of the street, you have to get a
permit from the city.  Renegades are done without permits.  As far as
renting a generator, if you look in the phone book, I would think under
rental, you'd find various rental places (Taylor Rental, for example in
washington, pa, rents EVERYTHING including generators).  I would think
anywhere you rent amps you can rent generators, as well.  I would ask
mskw1 about that.  Just a thought.

No doubt, no doubt.  I just think it's pretty disrespectful to say that raving
is about having "fun".  As if DJs #1 concern should not be to mix awesome cool
music but to make sure everyone has 'fun'.  To say that raving is about having
fun seems so selfish to me.  As if the quality of a rave is based upon how
much fun you can personally extract from it.  As if it's all there to service
you.  I mean in that sense raving would be no different than anything else
that some people happen to find very very fun, like crocheting or going to see
the tribe.  But I think it is pretty different.  And that difference, whatever
you want to argue it is, is, by definition, "what raving is all about".

Damn, this is kinda scary.  I've always gone to raves entirely to have fun
and meet new people.  True, I adore techno, house and breaks and think
quite a bit of it is incredibly artistic.  However, at raves I usually
lose all my seriousness and just flip out!  Going to raves is all about
none-stop dancing, glitter, candy, stickers, backrubs, really cool people
from places I've never even heard of, awe-inspiring light show, dj's
throwing down old favorites and scratchin' up new ones, drugs and hugs.
In a word, the most fun I could ever get for $20.  It doesn't bother me
that people might go to raves for different reasons.  I just think they
are probably missing out.  Of course, I've never been able to take
anything all that seriously which is probably why I ended up a
candy-raver.  

PLUR to the max,
jP

(sorry for being so disrespectful)

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!  All of my kids went to April Foolz and my girl and I 
couldn't make it, so we were all up for going to Full On on Sunday...

            OUTSIDE...IN THE WOODS...AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

When we heard it was cancelled we were crushed (to all you kids at 
A.F...it is always nice and COOL {well kind of} outside...)
Not to mention we were 2 hours into the trip...

Anybody hear when it's gonna be rescheduled for?  I've got 4 big ol' 
water jugs and a bunch of cups in my trunk that need sharin'! 
                          Yeeeeeeeeeeee HA!

Hey, what' up.  Where do you live?  If you live in pgh, then you are in
luck.  All you need is some money.  This is the only place I've heard of
this working, but there may be other places.  Go to the photo place on
Murray ave in squirrel hill.  And tell them you need photo ID.  They will
ask you how old you are and your birthdate and shit, andyou tell them
whatever you want.  Then they give you this ID that says on teh back rela
big that it can't be used for anything too important, but I know people
that use it to buy cigarettes and shit. 

Depending on how young you look they may ask you for ID, so you might
want to bring someone elses ID of some sort just in case.

Man, this is the kind of person I like to see at a rave.

Well, generaly "awesome cool" music leads to fun.

>> As if it's all there to service you.  

Yeah . .  it is.  I'm not understanding where you are coming from.  Do
you think that there is some higher power that a rave is put on for?  Is
it a sacrifice to a god or something?  Why would you pay $20 for
something that you aren't going to get anything out of?  do you see it as
being selfish to think that you will enjoy the rave?

I don't think you read all of my post.  I said that I'm not trying to be
smart . . . just trying to understand.  And I'm asking this person that
respond to me: If he thinks I'm so wrong, then what does he think raving
is all about?  I'm asking this out of curiousity and so I can understand
where he is coming from and because I can't imagine what he gets out of
it other than fun.

Steady getting misunderstood,

I just got off the phone with my friend from Virginia Tech.  He said two
friends of his went up to April Foolz this weekend, but only one came
back.

The other kid took two Es which were cut with something.  He passed out
late that night, was taken to the hospital where his kidneys failed, and
died.

I hope that this information may be useful to anyone who happened to buy
something there, but just might have not taken it.  This may be an
isolated incident, but it's not a myth. 

I've read about the heat, and perhaps that was an attributing factor to
his death, but accoring to the hospital, that was not the main case.


Be careful.

No fake IDs.

--Damn this part was so good I just had 2 leave it on for the emphasis
of the repetition !!!


vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
Damn, this is kinda scary.  I've always gone to raves entirely to have fun
and meet new people.  True, I adore techno, house and breaks and think
quite a bit of it is incredibly artistic.  However, at raves I usually
lose all my seriousness and just flip out!  Going to raves is all about
none-stop dancing, glitter, candy, stickers, backrubs, really cool people
from places I've never even heard of, awe-inspiring light show, dj's
throwing down old favorites and scratchin' up new ones, drugs and hugs.
In a word, the most fun I could ever get for $20.  It doesn't bother me
that people might go to raves for different reasons.  I just think they
are probably missing out.  Of course, I've never been able to take
anything all that seriously which is probably why I ended up a
candy-raver.  

PLUR to the max,
jP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

--uhhh....one word...NO

 IE: if ravin' had the same raw artistic elements, yet if it wasn't
> fun, would it still be ravin? 

--once again....No...then it would just be performance art, but probably educational!!

 It is all personal, no doubt.  I see the

>

--Absolutly the #1 concern!! The DJ is there because this is a business and they get PAID...
As long as ppl have "fun" and enjoy the DJ, he will continue to get paid. Otherwise...
They might as well sit at home.

  To say that raving is about having fun seems so selfish to me. 
  As if the quality of a rave is based upon how much fun you can personally
  extract from it.  As if it's all there to service you. 

--HHhhmmmmm....see waht I mean? Now U get it. It is enjoyable, but it is a business. 
And being all cut and dry here, I love this business, as long as I have "fun" @ it.
When the time comes that I don't....I leave it for somethin else...but we have such a
fantastic base of PLUR support built into this culture that I don't see that happnin'
any time soon.


  I mean in that sense  raving would be no different than anything else that some
  people happen to find very very fun, like crocheting or going to see the tribe. 
  But I think it is pretty different.  And that difference, whatever
> you want to argue it is, is, by definition, "what raving is all about".
 
--Can I say Amen? hehehe....I hope it is "different" and it stays that way!
Sides, I never claimed to be normal....Just plain ole ME!! 



> aaron and the anti-PLUR commission

> --R U serious? anti-PLUR? Oh I gotta hear the responses on that one.

April Foolz was not what i consider a good party... i had lots of fun... and
i am quite happy i attended... but it wasnt anything specacular... but still
worth the 7 hr drive (each way)



i only waited on line for abt 45 mins... (i got intothe party at 9:00) which
really suprisded me.. i thought i'd be on line for 3 hrs... i walked it..
and Dever was rocking it... i started running around and jumping and smiling
(there was LOTS of room to moove at this time... i was SOOOOOO happy and
excited for what would happen next...

the music was good.. nothing SPECTACULAR but good none the less... i enjoyed
everyones set except for Rabit in the Moon.. they turned the fucking party
into an overcrowded concert.. they played really mellow shit when i wanted
to dance... and towards the end of their set they anonced that they will be
signing autographs on their new cd.. i sat there like: WHATEVER.. thats some
fucking nerve they have... signing autographs... how cheezie.. who are
they -- the fucking spice girls...???????????? not only that.. u had to buy
the fucking cd... if they had an ounce of coolness on them they would have
given a way a few dozen copies.... but its good to finally know what u are
dealing w\   ... rabit in the moon gets NO respect from me... grrrrr!! now
i'm mad... i mean.. this was supposed to be a party... he whole point is
that the dj is not some distant unattainable preasance... my god... rabbit
on the moon thinks they are the big shit...... they really need to get over
themselves.. they were totally spinning for the wrong crowd...

ok moving on... i met so many cool kids there... everyone who i came into
contact w\ was super friendly and happy... my Chuckie (fom the RugRats) doll
was a big hit w\ everyone... although i gave it away after a while b/c i
couldnt dance w\ it any more and i got tired of carrying it... i gave it to
rhonda (the midget raver from DC) .. i asked her to hold on to it for me for
a bit... and then i told her that if i dont see her b4 the party ends, the
doll was hers to keep... i also had lightsabers w\ me.. which i had othe
kids hold onto for me.. (god i had way too much shit w\ me...) but aparently
everyone who played w\ them loved them...

kids from lotus, second sign, notes from the mind, and boo 2 all recognized
me.. although i totally couldnt place them at 1st..  it was good to run into
them.

i went to the netmeet.. buti didnt find anyone (not that i expected to) i
didnt have a laminate.. but hoepfully that will change soon... i ran into
Sonix from this list but i dont think he recognized me... w\ my newly dyed
hair...i was sitting down after having gotten a backrub and he just walked
away after giving me a hug and saying hello.. next time...

people i looked for but didnt find... e.wow, mark, deryck26, and a few
others.. i ran into stephanie.. who was all pimping w\ her bouble wrap
pannelled pants... (they were awsome)  and lisa w\ her awsome red hair
(although i thought it was way too hot to be waing a wig) ... and andie...
my longtime rave partner... it was just totally cool overall...

the thing is.. i wish local 12 wasnt so greedy... if they were at all cool,
they would have limited copacity to 5000 heads, so there would be room to
move... if they had done this, i would not have had the oportunity to go (i
had a friedn of mine pick up my tix from satelite the night b4 the party and
i met up w\ him just b4... so had they limited copacity, i wouldnt get a
ticket ) but it still would have been cooler for everyone else... i
understand they were reselling tickets so taht everyone could get in at the
door... (instead of cutting the tix in half,they took them and resol
them.. ) which means there were upwards of 10 thousand kids there... at
least they had peramedics and were prepared for people passing out and
stuff...

having said all that, it was just way too hotto have any fun.. i stopped
having fun at abt 12:30.. (when itpacked itself up) the restof teh time
(till abt 4 anyway) was a constant struggle just to move around..

my friend donny was having trouble breathing b.c of the heat.. and he doesnt
have athsma or anthing.. it was just way hot.. i saw hima t one point and he
was like... "i cant fucking breath.. but this music is making me cry" ... he
told me after the party taht he couldnt dance for more tahn 10 mins w\ out
having to go outside to get air... he also said :u dont know what kind of
torchure it was for me... to be listening to such good msic and not be able
to dance.."

he hated it... also.. he didn t like the drug situation... he told me that
he got asked to buy drugs so many times that he started yelling at all the
dealers ...like.. "get the fuck away from me.. i dont wantyour fucking
drugs.." atone point we were talking abt how all the drug dealers ruined
this fucking party and like 50 people turned their heads to look at us...
such a damn shame..

as Kostas has pointed out we saw a few kids smoking crack...  i didnt mind
it as much.. b/c u know.. the choice is your own to do what u want.. but i
do think its rather shady... i just satther like whatever...

i did roll... i waited till 12:00 to make sure things would be ok.. and then
i dropped.. and i know now that i shouldnt have... i took a crown.. even tho
i had taken them b4 and knew they werent bad.. but i wasnt impressed.. it
wasnt a happy roll..  it was so intense.. i felt more fucked up tahn
anything else... thats the last time i take crowns... EVER... i took them at
brass monkey 2... and i knew that they were so strong.... but i got like 12
backrubs... which were all lots of fun...

at one point, this girl pucked on me (on my shoe actually) and she sat there
appologizing.. i was like.. dude.. its totally ok.. i undrstand.. my parts
were so dirty anyway.. that it didnt matter.. i was just happy that she felt
ok...

thank u;s and other random stuff...

JaseN... thank u thank u thnk u thank u... for just being such a totally

Oh, I'm sorry.  I guess you just didn't UNDERSTAND all of my post.  He
replied to you that raving was art to him, and you replied back sort of
nastily.  To re-iterate in simpler terms, I don't care why anyone person
raves as long as they're getting something out of it that they consider to
be positive.  I don't care if you think I'm trying to be smart.  I don't
care if you think I'm being rude.  I don't care that raving is all about
fun and games to you: CONGRATULATIONS!  By saying "I can't imagine what he
gets out of it other than fun", belittles his views.  You're essentially
saying your ideas don't matter because I can't possibly understand you!
If this ISN'T what you're saying, then perhaps you should be more
articulate as to your feelings.  JUST A F#*!ING THOUGHT.

Kids, I know you want to cling to the urban legends like they're the gospel,
but if someone dies DIRECTLY from taking "e" then it is news to not only me,
but also to all the labs that test samples every month and conclude again and
again that INSTEAD of the stuff being "cut with something," it is SIMPLY NOT E
AT ALL!  This sort of story makes me feel absolutely terrible -- my heart goes
out to that poor kid's family and friends.  However, didn't several people post
about the tremendous heat inside the party?  Wasn't it insanely crowded? 
Dehydration is a very big deal -- something that one needs to be constatntly on
the lookout for.  People -- this is serious -- make your friends drink sports
drinks and take regular breaks from dancing.  Make them eat a nutritious meal
with a lot of carbohydrates before going to a party.  And keep in mind --
several prescription drugs have terrible interactions with other substances. 
If someone is on a presecription drug that is a MAOI, they MUST NOT
MIX this with any other drug without consulting a doctor.  Even some very 
common, usually harmless substances, like nutmeg, can cause a horrible, 
life-threatening reaction with such drugs.  I also wonder, did the hospital 
test this person's  blood and/or urine for all drugs?  A major reason why the 
"e cut with poison/heroin" rumor is because when someone is rushed to the 
hospital and the doctor ask either the victim or his friend what might have 
caused the problem, one might simply say, "He took esctasy -- and it was 
probably cut with something."  Then -- IN MOST CASES -- the doctors, to save 
time in aiding the victim will NOT ACTUALLY TEST THEM to find out if what they 
had been told was true.  Also, most people (as in doctors too) know so little 
about the drugs in the methylenedeoxy group (MDMA, MDA, MDEA) that they take 
others' words without questioning or researching.  It just doesn't matter that 
much to them.

Oh, and you know how someone's body shuts down when one dies of dehydration? 
Usually by kidney failure.

Okay, so how exactly does MDMA work?  What does it do?  Well, (basically --
this will be the simple, 100 words or less explanation) it causes
the brain to excrete a large amount of serotonin, the chemical used to regulate
mood and sleep.  The brain is always replenishing its supply of serotonin, and
after about a week its levels are back to normal.  MDMA has never been proved
to cause nerve axom damage (unlike MDA, which showed some damage in lab rats
that were given a tremendously gigantic dose daily for months -- nothing that
would ever happen with 2-4 times a month recreational use).  When the serotonin 
is released, body temperature rises slightly, and heart beat speeds up a little 
-- no more than like drinking a little coffee.  The PROBLEMS can occur because
you're so damn happy that you might be more prone to just not notice your
body's natural warning signals.  You're hot and sweaty, but dancing feels
great.  You have energy, so you don't realize how tired dancing for hours on
end is making you.  If you do not take regular breaks and keep drinking water --
YOU ARE NOT BEING RESPONSIBLE and could quite possibly be hurting yourself. 

I feel so terrible about this death having happened, and I know people
want to put the blame on the drugs rather than on the person.  Perhaps if MDMA
were ever legal, there would be more educational information about it, and
quality would be controlled.  But that ain't gonna happen no time soon ...

|ps - gbb is less than a week away. im excited as a mofo.


I don't know about that.  I liked it when mother fucker was expressed as
mutha fukka or the quirky, mutha fucca.  I think the former two spellings
give off more steam and they seem to make the reader giggle or perhaps make
you think of someone violently accosting you at dusk you with guns,
pinchers, and locusts.  I hear everyone [like 5 people] saying mofo
now'a'days -- where did it orginate, please?  I really want to hear hear

Sigh... my friend and I were both saying that we'd prolly hear of 20 or so
cases of people passing out... I'm suprised I didnt see more people passed
out on the floor. I did see ambulances outside when I left... I didnt expect
this, but I'd have to say the heat factor had to be a major part of it. Your
body just isn't made to be that hot for that long.

For the young kids who are healthy, w/plenty of energy who weren't too
drugged out it shouldn't have been too much of a prob, but for us old fogies
who're out of shape with asthma etc, it was hell... I couldn't even think
about the music... there was one thing on my mind - "I'm hot as fuck, I
can't breathe, and I need to cool off"

It seemed like the heat kind of nullified the E I took... I took 2 hits of
good stuff, and I felt almost nothing.

I was just wondering if it seemed alot hotter to me cause I waited outside 3
hours in the cold then went inside with a shocking temperature change...

I'm interested in hearing what other people thought of this event.

at any rate, sorry to hear this.

Dan

Never done it myself, have read alot about outdoor parties on the HyperReal
website... you should check it out...

Main thing I think would be if there would be neighbors to complain about
the noise...

If you do throw it, I'll come :)

I'm thinking about building a set of rather large speakers for this sort of
thing. Plan is to mail-order the woofers / tweeters / crossovers, and build
the enclosure from some sort of cheap wood that's better than plywood...
that way I could come and have something to offer... If anyone has done this
sort of thing before give me some tips :) Also if anyone has a program that
would tell me the correct enclosure size for the woofers, that would rock
too :)

April Foolz was not what i consider a good party... i had lots of fun... and
i am quite happy i attended... but it wasnt anything specacular... but still
worth the 7 hr drive (each way)

i only waited on line for abt 45 mins... (i got into the party at 9:00)
which
really suprisded me.. i thought i'd be on line for 3 hrs... i walked it..
and Dever was rocking it... i started running around and jumping and smiling
(there was LOTS of room to moove at this time... i was SOOOOOO happy and
excited for what would happen next...

the music was good.. nothing SPECTACULAR but good none the less... i enjoyed
everyones set except for Rabit in the Moon.. they turned the fucking party
into an overcrowded concert.. they played really mellow shit when i wanted
to dance... and towards the end of their set they anonced that they will be
signing autographs on their new cd.. i sat there like: WHATEVER.. thats some
fucking nerve they have... signing autographs... how cheezie.. who are
they -- the fucking spice girls...???????????? not only that.. u had to buy
the fucking cd... if they had an ounce of coolness on them they would
havegiven a way a few dozen copies.... but its good to finally know what u
are dealing w\   ... rabit in the moon gets NO respect from me... grrrrr!!
now
i'm mad... i mean.. this was supposed to be a party... he whole point is
that the dj is not some distant unattainable preasance... my god... rabbit
on the moon thinks they are the big shit...... they really need to get over
themselves.. they were totally spinning for the wrong crowd...

ok moving on... i met so many cool kids there... everyone who i came into
contact w\ was super friendly and happy... my Chuckie (fom the RugRats) doll
was a big hit w\ everyone... although i gave it away after a while b/c i
couldnt dance w\ it any more and i got tired of carrying it... i gave it to
rhonda (the midget raver from DC) .. i asked her to hold on to it for me for
a bit... and then i told her that if i dont see her b4 the party ends, the
doll was hers to keep... i also had lightsabers w\ me.. which i had othe
kids hold onto for me.. (god i had way too much shit w\ me...) but aparently
everyone who played w\ them loved them...

kids from lotus, second sign, notes from the mind, and boo 2 all recognized
me.. although i totally couldnt place them at 1st..  it was good to run into
them.

i went to the netmeet.. buti didnt find anyone (not that i expected to) i
didnt have a laminate.. but hoepfully that will change soon... i ran into
Sonix from this list but i dont think he recognized me... w\ my newly dyed
hair...i was sitting down after having gotten a backrub and he just walked
away after giving me a hug and saying hello.. next time...

people i looked for but didnt find... e.wow, mark, deryck26, and a few
others.. i ran into stephanie.. who was all pimping w\ her bouble wrap
pannelled pants... (they were awsome)  and lisa w\ her awsome red hair
(although i thought it was way too hot to be waing a wig) ... and andie...
my longtime rave partner... it was just totally cool overall...

the thing is.. i wish local 12 wasnt so greedy... if they were at all cool,
they would have limited copacity to 5000 heads, so there would be room to
move... if they had done this, i would not have had the oportunity to go (i
had a friedn of mine pick up my tix from satelite the night b4 the party and
i met up w\ him just b4... so had they limited copacity, i wouldnt get a
ticket ) but it still would have been cooler for everyone else... i
understand they were reselling tickets so taht everyone could get in at the
door... (instead of cutting the tix in half,they took them and resol
them.. ) which means there were upwards of 10 thousand kids there... at
least they had peramedics and were prepared for people passing out and
stuff...

having said all that, it was just way too hotto have any fun.. i stopped
having fun at abt 12:30.. (when itpacked itself up) the restof teh time
(till abt 4 anyway) was a constant struggle just to move around..

my friend donny was having trouble breathing b.c of the heat.. and he doesnt
have athsma or anthing.. it was just way hot.. i saw hima t one point and he
was like... "i cant fucking breath.. but this music is making me cry" ... he
told me after the party taht he couldnt dance for more tahn 10 mins w\ out
having to go outside to get air... he also said :u dont know what kind of
torchure it was for me... to be listening to such good msic and not be able
to dance.."

he hated it... also.. he didn t like the drug situation... he told me that
he got asked to buy drugs so many times that he started yelling at all the
dealers ...like.. "get the fuck away from me.. i dont wantyour fucking
drugs.." atone point we were talking abt how all the drug dealers ruined
this fucking party and like 50 people turned their heads to look at us...
such a damn shame..

as Kostas has pointed out we saw a few kids smoking crack...  i didnt mind
it as much.. b/c u know.. the choice is your own to do what u want.. but i
do think its rather shady... i just satther like whatever...

i did roll... i waited till 12:00 to make sure things would be ok.. and then
i dropped.. and i know now that i shouldnt have... i took a crown.. even tho
i had taken them b4 and knew they werent bad.. but i wasnt impressed.. it
wasnt a happy roll..  it was so intense.. i felt more fucked up tahn
anything else... thats the last time i take crowns... EVER... i took them at
brass monkey 2... and i knew that they were so strong.... but i got like 12
backrubs... which were all lots of fun...

at one point, this girl pucked on me (on my shoe actually) and she sat there
appologizing.. i was like.. dude.. its totally ok.. i undrstand.. my parts
were so dirty anyway.. that it didnt matter.. i was just happy that she felt
ok...

thank u's and other random stuff...

JaseN... thank u thank u thnk u thank u... for just being such a totally
cool kid (he bought me my ticket on friday nite and then met up w\ me at the
hotel b4 the party.. ) i couldnt have gone to this party w\ out u.. if ever
need ANYTHING.. just ask.. its yours... we have to party together more often

Sarah and co.. for the ride.. for hugs.. for watching my stuff.. and for the
floor to sleep on...

Todd.. thanks for helping me fid the food room and the joungle room.. i was
SOOOOO fucked up at one point...

Mark.. i didnt get your message until sunday nite... i ont get voiecmail and
pages when i'm ROAMING so.. i didnt know where to find u.. although i
lookedall over for ya... next time for sure...

Sean.... dude u grow taller each time i see u... this has gotto stop
already.

romulous... i'm so glad i got to meet up w\ u finally dude.. and i'm glad u
had a good time.. (i did too)... i'll be home faily soon.. we can get to
chill

Spike.. dude.. i'm so sorry for no getting in touch w\ u on satarday.. i
tried.. i was so afraid that u'd go to the party w\ out tix and have to
drive home.. i felt so bad.. i looked for u all nite..

Steph and Rob... for being possitive when there was only negativity all
around (none of the kids i was w\ liked the party... and it got frustarting
after a while)

Kostas... thank u.. for bringing out the best in me like u always do... for
dragging dina out w\ u... (only wish she had more fun.. and iw ish i got to
chill w\ her more.. i totally expected to bond w\ her.. but i didnt see her
much) ... for bringing w\ u lots of dumbdumbs.. and for that other gift u
gave me...i'm so glad i finally found u... thank u for a great 4 hrs... i
wish i could have come to the afterhrs (evn tho i heard they lasted maybe 20
mins) i hope u got me page.. the kids who i was w\ were not interested...
one of them got sick and spent the whole night in the hotel room... up until
that point i spent most of teh party alone.. as always, it was good to
chill.. SEE U AT BJORK 2 weeks from today... yeiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

i guess thats all for now kids...

much love,

galve.

I knew somebody who had the same idea . . . but they never threw it.  I
think geoff may have been involved . . . ask him.

the place they were thinking about was underground . . . that would
prevent sound from going everywhere, but aboveground it seems like the
sound would spraed over the surrounding area like a blanket causign
complaints from all around.

ABSOLUT

PS-geoff, I'm talking about steve bruder's plan to throw a party at the
place he used to valet park.

I say:
Fuck you.  I started going to raves before I was 18 (as I currently am)
and if I was in a city where there was an 18+ thing in full swing I would
hate it.  I think its bullshit that there should be an age limit on
raves.  sure sure kids are going can get in trouble, but this goes back
to the large discussion on people taking responsibility for their own
actions.

I think going to a rave is the best thing I've ever done in my life, and
I would like to pass that incredible experience on to others . . .

Man . . . look.  I'm not trying to start anything with anybody.  I think
what I'm trying to say is getting lost in the fact that I can't use an
inflection on my typing.  In none of these posts did I mean any
disrespect.  by saying "I can't imagine what he gets out of it other than
fun" is not me trying to belittle him.  Its me expressing that because of
the fact that raving is soo predominantly about having fun it is hard for
me to understand where he is coming from.  I'm not trying to say that his
opinion is wrong or anything of the sort.  I'm merely saying that its
hard for me to understand what he is saying.  

I'm sorry if I offended you, but I guess I should make sure what I'm
writing will be taken the way it is meant to be taken.

Steady getting misunderstood again and again . . .

	Perhaps people came on too strong for your tastes, but I think you 
should realize the position you put us in.  1) You are very young.  2) It
is illegal to provide someone who is underage the means to procure an
false identification.  (It's also illegal for someone under the age of 18
to buy cigarettes or to have something pierced without consent of a legal
guardian, in case you hadn't noticed).  
	Those laws are there for a reason, whether you agree with them or
not.  In case you hadn't noticed, smoking is BAD for you.  I've had many
loved ones die or almost die BECAUSE they smoked since the ripe old age of
12 or 13.  As for being pierced (correct spelling), you must be an adult.
What if you don't want it in two years.  What if you're done by someone of
disrepute and it's done wrong, irrevocably damaging your body?  You need
to be a responsible (and I stress responsible) adult in order to make
these decisions.  Maybe you'll be responsible at 16.  Maybe you won't be
responsible until 26.  Just take a good look at yourself in the mirror.   
	I really tried to give you the benefit of the doubt.  I tried to
give you a chance to establish yourself on the list.  Quite honestly, I
think you're immature and you don't seem to possess common sense.  By the
way, while you're in school, you might want to learn how to spell.  If
that doesn't work, buy yourself a dictionary.  They're cheap, in some
cases cheaper than drugs.

but you've got to love their satire and their attention to detail!
*grumble*
now really, i figure i find out about this whole new scene of phat music
that the rest of the world seems not to like and you'd figure we'd be
united, around something or another (i figured it would be our love for
music and having fun) but there are always those wonderful people who think
they are "holier than thow" which is one of the things that drove me away
from boring old sucky music.
this is just someone trying to have some fun and get some smokes and you go
off on a wonderfully sarcastic tirade with some chip on your shoulder!
don't like crystal method or the wee little ravers?
fine, just keep your shite attitude to yourself and then the next time i
run into you at a party we can talk about about happy things like politics
and football since you don't seem to be able to offer any genuine advice
and never learned when to keep your fucking mouth shut!!!
fuck off!

Being my culturally isolated self, I learned about it on the net -
www.jiveon.com to be precise...
they have this daily jive mailing list, and after a few weeks, I was
cracking people up in my old hick high school by speaking in jive.  The
best ever is the JiveGuy's resolution of Zeno's paradox using convergence
of geometric series.  The best part is, it's made by

Deuce
Ofay

well i have to say that i agree with jenifer here. i've never smoked in my
life but my neighbor smoked since she was 12 and at the ripe old age of 19
she can't play basketball or run anymore

as for piercing, well maybe wait a bit more, i've wanted an eyebrow ring
for 2 years and have allways had the excuse of playing soccer all year to
not be able to get it and i'm glad i didn't beause i know that i just
wasn't responsible enough last year.  i'm getting one in july though! so
call me a hypirite or whatever but i'll be 18 in sept and i think i've
waited enough
and dictionaries are cheap but there are probably some horendous spelling
errors in here some i'm not gonna preach
 and i just sent a rather nasty message to someone on the list on this same
subject, well i'm really sorry, just the original message pissed me off
tons, so don't take too much offense, i see where you are coming from, i
was very funny either way

In a message dated 98-04-27 22:13:25 EDT, you write:

<< the thing is.. i wish local 12 wasnt so greedy... if they were at all cool,
 they would have limited copacity to 5000 heads, so there would be room to

 had a friedn of mine pick up my tix from satelite the night b4 the party and
 i met up w\ him just b4... so had they limited copacity, i wouldnt get a
 ticket ) but it still would have been cooler for everyone else... i
 understand they were reselling tickets so taht everyone could get in at the
 door... (instead of cutting the tix in half,they took them and resol
 them.. ) which means there were upwards of 10 thousand kids there... at
 least they had peramedics and were prepared for people passing out and
 stuff.. >>

Hmm. why doesn't any of this suprise me. "Rave called Happiness" anyone?  This
Local 13 crew has no respect from me or any of my friends. And to think that
when Rabbit in the Moon played they "Turned it into a concert"? The whole idea
from the begining reminded me of a concert. Even the Flyer was to big!  Maybe
it's just me but i always try to shy away from anything that looks like it
Screams "The biggest RAVE in history!!!!"  And every time i see one of this
crews events, thats what it screams to me.  Like i said, maybe it's just me,
but i like smaller events(at most about 2000) where u have great music all
night, room to dance(and breathe) and can cool off if u need it.  
keep it underground, these people will take over if u let them.

> It's not like we haven't seen it b4 but it can b prevented.....
> promoters as well !!!! R U listening?

When a promoter sells out an event to capacity and then turns around
and resells the reclaimed tickets to get another couple thousand in
the door, it appears as though the only thing they're listening to
is the sound of their workers' grunts as they drag the overstuffed
bags of money out of the venue.

There's a certain "reasonable" limit to anything.  With regard to
venues' stated capacities, usually these can be exceeded by 150% or
more when it comes to throwing a party... but obviously if you
wanted to you could just keep packing people in until no one could
move.  

When this example of "reasonable" is surpassed the _only_ thing that
benefits or improves is the promoter's (and possibly venue's)
earnings.  It's certainly less safe, the people that attend don't
have as good of a time, the performers don't play to as receptive an
audience, it's harder to manage, etc.  And the more people and money
this involves, the worse things get.

Many people were dissapointed that night at AF2 because of it.  In
all likelihood several were made physically ill, most likely
dangerously so.  One person (allegedly) died.  All because the
promoters decided it would be okay to weigh the disadvantges of
packing all those extra people in there vs. all those extra
thousands of dollars.

Can a cash value be placed on human life and safety?  I wasn't
there, but it sure seems by the various accounts as if some people
have.

Now what remains is... what are people going to do about it?

ok people don't shoot me if this turns out to be wrong but i've been
informed that this fridayAMP will showthe video for my track - Defcon 1 off
of "When Worlds Collide" in it's entirety for what is widely rumored to be
the last episode of AMP to air on MTV. does that mean MTV is saying no to
electronic music, probably not, it's just that they will likely serve it up
in an unmixed (and ultimately uncool) format like all their other video
shows. so set your VCR's for this friday's amp.  i believe it comes on MTV
at 2am but check your listings or the mtv web site. i was told the
reasoning of playing it first and in it's entirety is that this is the
video that is likely to get them sued. no show, no one to sue.

you knew it couldn't last forever, nothing good does.
so there, they decided to go out with a bang. pittsburgh style!

take care,

Just a little comment on this --
	When you're a kid, i.e. 16 or younger, people with think you're stupid no
matter where you go - internet, parties, even teachers in schools blow you
off.  You haven't been introduced to good literature, you prolly haven't
started a coffee habit yet, you can't solve a rubik's cube, your friends
are still going to the same school so you can't e-mail them, you can't
drive, your video game system has just been made obsolete and since you
don't have a job, you can't buy a new one, you have to plan social events
around groundings and/or detentions, and if you live in the suburbs, you
can't even take a scenic walk in nature.  Basically, your life is pretty
boring, but I hope you at least have the sense not to sit around listening
to Nirvana and writing weak poetry.  You need a fake ID to do stuff, right?
	Well, if you're using boredom as an excuse to justify doing things that
will KILL you, then I agree with Foulmood that you're immature.  A family
friend just died last year to lung cancer.  He had quit about 20 years
beforehand, but it still got him.  As for piercings, I'll quote my friend's
mom, who said "If it's the dumbest thing you do in your life, I'll be
pretty happy."  But is it worth doing something that could get you thrown
in jail or at least heavily fined?  What is your piercing supposed to say
that is so important to you?  Most people I know with odd piercings were
trying to look "tough" or "extreme."  IMO, that effect is killed when
you're in HS because you live with your PARENTS.  Now before the
how-does-this-relate-to-raves team jumps on me, I just want to say that I
have no problem with young kids joining the scene.  Youthfulness is a major
component of raves.  It's not like sex or existentialism, where a certain
level of maturity is required to really appreciate it.  I also disagree
with whoever implied that you are just riding an MTV bandwagon - if you
were, you would probably be listening to puffy or ska or whatever.  

							Just some thoughts, don't kill me if you disagree :)

     Alright, this is my last post on this subject.  I'm sick of it. 
     I totally agree with foulmood that whole problem is people telling other
people what raving is all about.  That's why, in my original reply, I said
nothing about my personal views.  I just said I was sick of hearing people try
to tell other people how it is.  I only went off on my "art" tirade after
directly asked what I thought raving should be about.

     On a separate note, about the whole shayne a.k.a. gruncie/fake id thing,
I feel obligated to say something on her behalf because I'm the one who
suggested that she write the list.  (I remembered someone on the list asking
me before if I needed a fake id, but I couldnt remember who.)  
     First of all, I dont think shayne is what you might call a typical 14
year old.  I'll agree that that age sounds pretty young when you say it, but
if you'd meet her you'd probably have a hard time telling if shes 14, 16, or
even 18 for that matter.
     Secondly, and I'm refraining from lapsing into another debate, I believe
to the highest degree in giving people control over their own lives.  What
else do you have but your own life and if you can't do with it what you want
then why is it even worth having?  I believe in giving people freedom even
when applied to such topics as drugs, suicide, and the young.  No corallaries.

i don't think it's a bad thing to let kids go to events where drugs,
alcohol, dancing, kissing, etc are taking place, or even for them to
participate in them.  let kids learn and take responsibility.  don't try
to hide homosexuality or drinking from them.  and i don't feel guilty when
i teach kids about stuff like this.  

sincerely

Where's my PLUR bat?
Look, she speaks the lingo! The ever powering and instant debate winner:
PLUR!  I've got to be gracious now to a 13 year old who wants to take up a
habit that will make you hack lungs and get nose cancer!  I've been
smoking for years... since I was 16.  And I still wasn't allowed then...
what a fucking waste of money it all is! *puffpuff*

And don't come running to me when your eye becomes infected and your
tongue has to be amputated.  Or you need a stomach pump because you've
swallowed your barbell!

Please, help this girl out!  What is this world coming to?!  This girl
needs to SMOKE and PUT HOLES IN HER!  Everyone knows you have to be an
*individual* these days!  ESPECIALLY in grammar school!

To sum up your lengthy post concerning E (well documented info on
Hyperreal, I'm sure) the crux of the matter is that this kid died.

I just spoke to another friend of mine who also goes to Virginia Tech, and
the message is spreading around very quickly in Blacksburg.  She told me
that a few more friends of hers who went up with the kid in question
almost bought from that dealer, but decided against it.  

The doctors test revealed that he died of kidney and liver failure due to
the ingestion of pills which believed to be E initially.  It was the kid's
second party ever, and that is all he injested.

Regardless of what you have read about "E doesn't contain Heroin, speed,
etc", the pills that he swallowed were SOLD TO HIM AS ECSTASY and he of
course took them.  People trust people at raves these days (god knows
why?) and NATURALLY he's not running around with a couple test tubes and
the other assorted lab equipment that's required to check what is inside a
pill.

It's a pill, and a pill can contain anything from MDMA to PCP to Lye to
sugar.  And i'm sorry but that's just plain frightening.  Social awareness
should not concentrate less on applauding the drug as being a
fuzzy-fun escape, but the reality of it being a catalyst for sick fucks
who have actually been lowered to the point in their lives that they have
to sell *poison* in a pill form to make a quick $30 dollars.  Because
that's *exactly* what happened in Philadelphia.  This isn't some UK Betts
story about that girl who died of heat exhaustion.  

Kidneys and livers do not just decide to fail from heat stroke, 
certainly not in the body of a healthy college student.

I'd like to finally add that this is one of the reasons I am getting fed
up with people trying to defend the *child* on this list in her attempts
to get a fake id.  Anyone who is over the age of 20 can attest to the
notion of *maturity*, provided they are still somewhat sane like myself.
Giving a 13 year old an ID these days is almost like selling their lives
away to debautchery.  I'd like to think more positive about humanity, but
I have strong doubts, especially coming from a child who can't spell and
actually says "plur" and capitalizes the "E"s in their name.

toungue in cheek, yet gravely serious,

hannibal

Not really.  It still apalls me to think that you would help a child get
an id, to buy cigarettes or to go to a club.  Either way.

Any smile casted by my end was strictly facetious.

look that one up.

I'll get you all, my pretties!
And your little dog, too!

Raves may be a microchasm in the whole scheme of it all (widening by the
second..) but I would hope that common sense is still something that
should be applied.

well, the place we're going to have it is definitely going to be an
industrial park, on a friday, at night. the only difference between the
two possibilities is that one of them is surrounded by trees on all sides,
as well as pretty far from the nearest neighbour. and since it's gonna be
at night, everyone's gone home, and no complaints. };)

But Amanda, it wasn't heat exhaustion, it was organ failure!

I also  really would like to see the promoters take a stand to conflict
some of the other allegations that they have been recieving in regards to
this party:

1) extreme overcrowding can lead to ineffective fire/police/EMS service
2) ineffective searching of what seems to be entirely shady dealers
3) poor sound
4) ticket mishandlings

but therein lies more threads.

<< so am i alone in not seeing what age has to do with the negative
ramifications of smoking, peircing, or clubbing? >>

     No, you are definitely not alone.  
     If one's sole argument against doing things like smoking is that they are
bad for you then I don't really see why all this animosity is focused on lil'
14-year-old Shayne.  I mean I'm sure there are dozens and dozens of other
people on this list that do potentially harmful drugs.  Why has there never
been any condescending reprimand of them?  Why don't you go up to strangers
who are smoking at parties and say, "You know, smoking is bad for you, you
should quit" and get as hostile as y'all have gotten towards Shayne.  Is it
because, when you reach the age of (umm ... I forget what it is ... oh yeah,
this is America in late 20th century) 18, you suddenly attain the right to do
these intrinsically atrocious things to yourself?  Where's the logic in that!?

After many attempts to respond to the original post, I will just
add this:

>
>But Amanda, it wasn't heat exhaustion, it was organ failure!
>

Perfectly healthy people can die from kidney failure caused
by heat exhaustion. Do a search on 'heat kidney failure' and
you will find several examples of just that. Here is an example:

AP:11/17/96
Donald R. Roventini Jr., 16, died from heart and kidney failure
brought on by dehydration and heat exhaustion on the first day of
(foorball) practice on Aug. 14, according to the federal lawsuit filed
Friday. 

It does happen. The fact that the place was so hot that nobody
could dance for more than ten minutes couldn't have had anything
to do with the death. E does make you do some stupid things,
like dancing far beyond your limits, but if you use common sense,
these kind of things don't have to happen.

I agree, the promoters are every bit as much to blame as the
kid himself.

hm... looks like some peeps are buying into the common american notion
of creating a "child proof" society. life is dangerous & there's no way
to take all elements of danger out of it. there's always the possibility
of dying in a carwreck or spontaneously combusting ;)
more importantly, people learn from their experiences. apparently sex &
trauma are the 2 greatest maturing agents. I'm sure everyone can think
of someone that they know who was sheltered as a child and is now pretty
damn naive or plain stupid about stuff. I think dealing with stress, bad
situations, and not getting what you want are integral parts of growing
up. I don't think that it's good for society to try to destroy all of
them, but rather, channel them a little better through education, etc.

> Anyone who is over the age of 20 can attest to the

> away to debautchery.

look who's never been abroad... I spent 2 years in Hong Kong drinking
from age 17 in bars (and avoiding sleazy old men...) they're drinking
age is 18, but isn't strictly enforced... how do "kids" manage that if
they aren't _20_ and "mature"? Back in the day people got married when
they were 13/14. are current times more dangerous? doubtful. but there
is now this artificial "teenager" period where the child wants to strive
for independence (and, I would argue, has most of the skills necessary
to do that) but is held back from increased responsibility by parents
and society. Which is not to say that I think teenagers are necessarily
ready to be completely on their own, but that the laws and restrictions
placed on them are inappropriate. so what if this girl wants a fake id?
she'll at least be going to legal businesses (because she's probably
doing it so she can get into bars & clubs... anyone can just get alcohol
if they try hard enough...) Besides, who's to say that just being young
will lead to rampant drinking? being throwing up drunk once was plenty
for me...

as for drugs, well, they are *illegal* and once you do something that is
illegal, those actions are your own responsibility. not to say that
other circumstances don't come into play, or that the E-related death
was not regrettable, but it's pretty naive to think that drug dealers
have any obligation to their buyers (although they could have sold a
safer type of bunk e, say altoids?)

America is supposed to be the land of the free, but in many ways, we
have less freedom than the citizens of other countries. sometimes
freedom means that people deny their own responsibilities.

well, that's my contribution to social change.

Oh no not again.

Let's not turn this into a "e is safe/e has this or that" argument-- which
has been debated endlessly in waves on every mailing list around the
country for ages.

And I would hope that you wouuld find a more repuatble source than any
Nicholas Saunders book. He was a hippie.

OK anyhow, something in that pill killed the kid. Maybe it should have
been heroin, since "heroin's safe" according to people who endlessly
defend E.  But it was something in the pill.  My friend at VaTech said
that another kid died last year at the school after taking what he
believed was E-- test results found trace elements of four other narcotics
in his system, even though he only took the pills.

Take it as you will.  A pill can be anything, and THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS
DISCUSSION is to realize that SOME PEOPLE DO put wack shit in them in
order to make some quick money.  I would consider the rest of you
fortunate, at the least.

18 is still an early age in this country where bizarre morals and dated
laws that shuold have never been written run rampant.

Common sense has to be acquired these days.

I'm just looking out for the common man.  And I think that anyone should
be able to voice their opinion on it.

well what happens is ppl reply to all senders, so that you're getting is a
reply directly to you and a copy from the list--therefore 2 copies.
i get 3 sometimes, one to me, one to the listadmin (me) and one to the list
that i get also.   makes for really boring email sometimes!
anyhow, if its a reply to a msg you posted thats why.  or even a reply to a

Generally, people who overdose on narcotics die of cardiovascular
failure, not kidney/liver failure. As I said in my previous message,
it is much more likely that the heat exhaustion caused the death
than any pill he got.

Prove to anyone that there has ever been even one case of 'wack
shit' (meaning something that will kill you) being sold as E. If this 
dealer was selling shit that was so bad, why didn't everyone else
who bought from him wind up dead? I mean, did he only sell the
bad stuff to that one person and nobody else? Get real. If the place
had been better ventilated, the kid would still be alive today, E or
no E.

Does anyone know of any REGULAR (i.e. weekly) drum & bass events going on
in this city? It's getting very dry. Barely anyone supported Alex's Friday
night things a while ago at the Pieta, Aaron&Jeff's jungle at 1148 or hte
Rhythm Room, and I am not about to pay to get into Trilogy for 30 min of
jungle every other week and on a Sunday (sorry Mike :-). In any case, I
would think there would be more d&bheads with the recent turnovers and
possible some new weeklies catering to the steppers..or maybe not...

Dyin for some d&b

Ok... now this is obviously not a good thing to do, but come on we were
all little kids stealing smokes from mom/dad/brother/sister at one point
or another. I'm not endorsing what this person is doing, just lighten up
ok? :)

Secondly, the grammar and spelling of the above message is better then
half of the posts I see on this list... just something to think about.

If I may, i'd like to refer you to the excellent pages at
http://ecstasy.org/. If you take a look at their most recent studies, it
shows that 75% of the pills tested that were marketed on the street as
ecstasy contained *NO* MDMA (the active ingredient in todays
ecstasy)!!!! Only 6 out of the 35 pills tested contained MDMA. So what
does this mean? You should be very careful with what pills you take as
you're probably not getting ecstasy. The previous post about avoiding
MAOIs with drugs was very true as well.

Educate yourself and others before you take ANY drugs. You'll be safe,
and you'll find yourself having a much better experience that way as
well. :)

Ok, like I am not really supposed to say anything, 'cause like I don't
wanna build up any hopes or get in trouble with certain people who
bounced the idea around, but like Renegades are going to be happening,
but I can't say when, or where or who, 'cause nothing is definate, 
so I should just shut up, but I can't really, 'cause there are solid
plans, but not so solid they are set in stone, but I just want everyone 
out there to remain hopeful, and don't get too nostalgic, 'cause these 
ones will really be good, but I can't say how good, and
now I will just go sit down and behave myself, and let the Ultimate
Machine that all Ravers worship handle things.

I thought I might be posting this sometime today.

Deep Thoughts, by Amanda Gusman, junior, Kenyon College

	"Man, it's gotta suck to be a drug guru, like
	Leary or Saunders ... cause you might say a hundred 
	intelligent things and one dumb thing -- and all
	people will want to quote and cling to would be the 
	one dumb thing."

I will not answer any responses to this seriously.  All comments from me will

Now, I have a 20 page paper to write, for school, in the process of developing
and bettering my mind.  Adieu.

Oh my gosh, call Columbo!  I bet someone was out to get this kid!  I bet
they were disguising his murder with his use of illegal substances!
That's it!  Everybody looks at his death and says either it was the drugs
that killed him or it was the non-existent ventilation that killed him!
Perfect crime.  This guy'll never be caught.  Someone please call Matlock!

Oops, my bad. I was thinking of Alexander Shulgin, who co-wrote

well, if an 18 y/o wants cigs, he can go to the store and get them.  As
long as I'm not going to be around when they need one of those holes
punched in their throat, fine.  If a 16 y/o wants cigs, she can either bum
them off of people, which I don't mind, or get a fake ID.  The latter
requires an older person to stick his neck out at the risk of jail time
during the expensive process of making one.  It's also a risk every time
Ms. Nicotine gets carded.  An analogy follows.
Dumb : Using the toaster in the bathtub.
Dumber : Asking somebody on an internet mailing list to shoplift a toaster
for you to use in the bathtub.
I think the law is just as stupid as you do, but this is not the proper

I was gonna keep my Big Mouth Shut, but since you mentioned it Hannibal, 
I'm not one for fake ID's either.  There is a good reason
for a lot of things, but a fake ID I never believed in them.

13 yrs old huh?  What is the rush to grow up so fast?  I know what
usually happens when people sometimes think they are more than what
they are capable of, and that is when it hits, the reality, too much
way too soon.

Trust me, you don't look this young at 35 if you lived a life time
in a year.  That is what is going on, "I can't wait gotta do this
and that, and the other..."  Too bad common sense never seems to kick 
in.  By that time a kid is on the way, empty sheets of LSD are on the 
floor as well as containers of other substances, and a dude who suddenly 
walks out saying "Not my problem, got stuff to do."

Just a warning.  Maybe whoever that is will be lucky and the bad stuff 
won't happen.  I just pray they know what they are getting into.

 Maybe I should have been a little bit more clear on this... what I
meant to say was that everyone has at least one point in their younger
years where you could relate to how this girl feels. Weather it be
smoking, drinking, or staying out late. 

 Personally, i'd have to agree that smoking should be regulated. I don't
smoke, but I did when I was younger and I can tell you how hard it is to
quit.

 Hannibal
May I ask you  a  question or two, since you  seam to be trying to figure out
my life and tell me what to do and not to do...
What kind of  community  did you grow up in?
Me  well, I  grew up and am still living in a Jewish Orthodox community, I go
to a Jewish Orthodox day  school here, I  speak  and learn Hebrew, learn
Bible, and Talmud everyday
( I am in school from 805 till 430!! And only in 8th grade) I am also forced
to be religious around my house 
I HATE IT  I WANT TO GET AWAY.. 
That is one of the reasons I smoke I need something, understand where I am
coming from?? 
About raving, I guess I need to do something that I myself found, enjoy, and
nothing is pushed upon me.. Can you understand that?
Yes, maybe I am 14  but I dont feel like it I feel 9 and other times I feel 29
get it??

And what ever before one ridicules (ehham!!) another maybe they should talk to
them find things out, instead of making them feel dumb!!!.. I really want to
love everyone, I am only writing this so maybe you will understand, yes maybe
I am wrong, maybe I am only 14 but  hey we only learn from out mistakes
right?? Any comments, email me
   peace
     Shayne
p.s. yes this was addressed to  Hannibal but after what has been said on the
list I feel everyone should read this!

HEY KIDS, THE STORY IN THE POCONO RECORD IS sooooooooooooo FUCKED...
"...wild, with teenagers slamming into each other as live bands pelted
out alternative music..."
                         

                          ~~~WHAT THE FUCK?!~~~


I really am sorry that a kid had to lose his life, and that others were 
taken out in ambulances; it's so sad.  The wack-ass media is having a 
field day on this one.  I couldn't even read the rest of the article(s).


comments anyone?               *hugs*
                                 Miss Corey Lea

Exactly... and the stories I've heard is that the doctors tested him and he
died from E... well we all know you can't die from 2 hits of E, so the story
was modified to say 2 hits of supposedly E that was probably tainted...
excuse me, but It seems unreal that a doctor would have a result chart that
would say "tainted E" in one column with a check next to it... Common sense
says that if it was tainted with say Arsenic, that Arsenic would have
appeared in his blood and be attributed as the cause of death. not "Tainted
E"... bleah.. It's anyone's guess as to what happened to him, and my money
is on Heat exhaustion... I have to consider the number of kids that came
with exactly $30, and had thier water bottles thrown away by the
door-checkers, and couldnt afford to buy water so just went without. At any
rate I dont think anyone with common sense could remove all liability from
the promoters.

That is, of course, unless it's your express purpose to kill yourself or you
don't mind if that results.  (After all, it IS pretty fun to eat toast while
bathing.)  Also, if you heard that an anonymous person on that list is adept
at stealing toasters, it's not so unreasonable to write the list. (Let me
repeat.  I told Shayne that I had been asked by someone from the list before
if I wanted a fake ID, but I couldn't remember who.)

Ok, its not pb-cle related, but its rave-related, and quite humorous to
me.  Check out the website for the dutch hardcore label:

www.thunderdome.com

And look at the 'dating service'. 

I particularly like the guy who's playing the recorder. :)

Well i wasn't goin to respond any of this age stuff, but i'm simply no good at
keepin my mouth shut and i felt the need to prove the point further....me
being 16 and all.....

<< When you're a kid, i.e. 16 or younger, people with think you're stupid no
 matter where you go - internet, parties, even teachers in schools blow you
 off. >>>
very very very true...though, i've actaully managed somewhat to avoid this
since  in the "rave scene"...

<<< You haven't been introduced to good literature,>>>
*sigh* by far not true...list of books i most recently read:
~"Brave New World", by Aldous Huxley
~"Thus Spoke Zarathustra", by Friedrich Nietzsche
~"Junky", by William S. Burroughs
and the list goes on...i'm a active reader...((grew up without a t.v., thank
god!!))
 
<<<you prolly haven'tstarted a coffee habit yet, >>>
hehe...nope but i drink alot of tea =^)

<<<you can't solve a rubik's cube, >>
can anyone??

<<<your friends are still going to the same school so you can't e-mail them,
you can't drive, >>>
i've got friends across the US and across the seas...most of which are at
least 5 years older than me..not all..but alot...and i've been driving since i
first turned 15, though, true i can't get many places on my own, but that's
where the friends normally help and step in, but i get my license soon! (would
already have it if it weren't for ohio's drivers education law *but i'm not
even goin to touch that subject*) 

<<<your video game system has just been made obsolete and since you
 don't have a job, you can't buy a new one, >>>
never really cared for video games (which also falls in with the fact that i
grew up without a t.v., which helps in the whole game video gave thing), and
i've put in over 12 applications in the last week trying to get a job, but no
one seems to hire unexperienced 16 year olds...hmmm....

<<<you have to plan social events around groundings and/or detentions, >>>
guilty as charged on that one...but hey i can't help it my school and parents
are all anal facist pigs!!!  (( i was only 3 minutes late to school when i've
gotten my last 2 saterday schools!! plus i get grounded if i dont make my bed
every morning, clean my room everynight, do laundry by 6pm every friday, set
the table for dinner by 5:30pm every evening, and i have to be in bed asleep
by 10:30pm on schoolnight, the list goes on for ever......hence i ended up
well earning one of my nicknames "the lil' runaway"))

<<<and if you live in the suburbs, you can't even take a scenic walk in
nature.>>>
i've always lived in one suburb or another, some nice...some really not so
nice, but i've always managed to get to the great outdoors, i mountain climb,
hike, and camp, whenever possible....((luck was on my side with this though))
 
<<<Basically, your life is pretty boring,>>>
thankfully no, though i have to credit raves for now filling my long insomnia
filled weekends =^)
 
<<<but I hope you at least have the sense not to sit around listening
 to Nirvana and writing weak poetry.>>>
we all (or mostly all anyway) have had our "lesser" days, some of us just
moved up alittle quicker, i actually rather enjoy writing poetry (though i
hope its not "weak",,,i'm particularly fond of beatnik poetry) and one of my
main focuses in life, is art and music (i draw quite a bit, and play the
violin,... though techno tends to be my favorite, i have a wide appriciation
for most music, except country *ew*, every person has there limits:-)~

<<<  You need a fake ID to do stuff, right?>>>
nah, i've been smoking for too long already ((on and off since i was 10, and
no i'm not lieing)) but i'll get my own i always have,((with help sometimes
true, but if possible i try to get them myself)) i try to stand by my
convictions...
 
<<Well, if you're using boredom as an excuse to justify doing things that
 will KILL you, then I agree with Foulmood that you're immature. >>
hmm...i dont suppose this relates to me, for those reasons anyway..though i'll
be honest, i have done, and will continue to use drugs, but i know moderation
is always important, and i try to find all the info i can on a drug before i
use it ((**thanks for the info about "E" Amanda))...but i honestly do it for
the fact that it can somewhat liberate the mind, and let me experience this
world in a slightly different light..even if for only a night....the rest is
up to me of course...((though i've gone to as many parties sober as i have
with drugs, music is enough, but i like to indulge too))

 <<<A family
 friend just died last year to lung cancer.  He had quit about 20 years
 beforehand, but it still got him.  >>>
i'm not gonna touch this with a ten foot pole! ((i still sometimes live in
denial))

<<As for piercings, I'll quote my friend's mom, who said "If it's the dumbest
thing you do in your life, I'll be pretty happy."  But is it worth doing
something that could get you thrown in jail or at least heavily fined?  What
is your piercing supposed to say that is so important to you?  Most people I
know with odd piercings were trying to look "tough" or "extreme."  IMO, that
effect is killed when you're in HS because you live with your PARENTS. >>
i've wanted piercings, even tattoes before, and i'll have them someday...for
reasons such as, well...i'd like to think of myself as an artist, and why not
use myself to display art, though i'm waiting till i really know what i
want,(( and until i'm out of the house considering i'll be kicked out if i
come home with them on me now))

 <<<Now before the
 how-does-this-relate-to-raves team jumps on me, I just want to say that I
 have no problem with young kids joining the scene.  Youthfulness is a major
 component of raves.>>>
i've run into every age of people at the raves i've gone to, actually most
people think i'm at least 19, but once age is mentioned...no matter what
people say, i've seen the looks i've gotten...though over all, MOST people
have respected me more because of my age, and i respect that in return....

 <<< It's not like sex or existentialism, where a certain
 level of maturity is required to really appreciate it.>>>
**NO COMMENT**

<<<I also disagree
 with whoever implied that you are just riding an MTV bandwagon - if you
 were, you would probably be listening to puffy or ska or whatever.  
 
 							Just some thoughts, don't kill me if you disagree :)
 
 									Jim >>>

i'm glad you stated what you did...its given me a perfect chance to show that
some of us teens actually use the brains we were born with....basically i'm a
foolish girlie, who wants the world to know she appriciates everything she was
blessed with ((even though she was not blessed with the gift of good
spelling))..and i suppose i should mention i've only been to 6 raves, but its
already become a major part of my life ((not the only part though, of course))
and i'm sickly addicted to them...but bein new i think i've managed pretty
well..i've already made friends with some of you on this list...i'm a pretty
quick learner.....if given the chance.........

....just one girlie who loves loud music, and dancing on clouds....

I would just like everyone to take a moment and think back when we were
all her age.  Ok now that everyone has done this remember how much we
hated the grownups limiting what we were doing.  I say we leave well
enough alone and let her experience things for herself

Just a reminder that the Inaudible radio/webcast is broadcasting
all the latest and greatest techno & house music tonight from 
9-11 pm eastern standard time. 

During the Inaudible show we will be giving away promo 12"s 
and cds so yet another reason to tune in. 

The show will be accessible by visiting WCSB 89.3 FM for
those in the cleveland area. For those people out of the area
can listen over the internet by visiting http://www.wcsb.org
every Wednesday from 9-11 pm EST. The show will be broad-
cast in the AudioActive format (which is actually much
better than RealAudio). You can download the Audio Active
plugin for free at http://www.audioactive.com/player/

now i have to ask ... who can't spell?

and i despite the fact that i am 21, i still don't understand what you're
saying about maturity and debauchery.  but i will have to give respect to
hannibal@bu.edu cos i usually agree with what he/she says.

Shayne,

  I think that you are looking for escapes from your background which are 
a bit more mature for your age.  Growing under strict religious discipline
or not, clublife, raves, piercings and yes cigarettes are specific acts of
defiance.  Defiance should not be taken strictly in order to escape from
realities in life, nor should they deviate for the sake of deviation.

There are plenty of choices that you have to make for yourself during
your time here on Earth.  I think that in order for you to experience
raving in the late 1990s from a safer and more realistic standpoint you
should first face the trials that are normal for a 14 year old to
experience.  Broaden your worldview, start to learn who you are, and your
surrpondings.. Then in time assimilate, upon will, to whichever level of
experience you wish to partake once you attend a party. 

In short, live raves vicariously through this list for a while, if your
interest is piqued.  But really, you are too young to party now.

hops off of mezzanine, leaps into the fray

-hannibal

i totally think anyone should be allowed to go to a party.  i wouldn't
uninvite anyone, whether she was ugly, retarded, 12 years old, gay, black,
carpenter, dropout, athlete, millionaire, whatever.  just knowing only one
thing about someone is so not enough to make a judgement like that.

so what are we gonna start asking for id at house parties and renegades?

whoever wrote that message to shayney saying that all 14 year-olds are too
young to come to our parties is ... uh, someone i disagree with.

now where is the geriatric raver brigade?  no 30-somethings have anything
to say about this?

peace and luv,
i which have little to do now that exams are done

Okay -- I'm looking at this flier for a Dayton party on 5-30, and after it
lists all the dj's it says "Master of Ceremonies: Different Strokes Star???"

Different Strokes star?!!!! As in Arnold, Willis or Kimberly?

I don't know how much I like this.

I'd like to know too: I'd really like to go, but I'm debating pending
further evidence.

If you go to the TECHNOLOGY homepage:
http://www.pitt.edu/~gmmst22/technology.htm

And scroll down to the event listings, click on Getto Booty Battle, and it
will take you there.

I'm really hoping too - should be massivly enjoyable if so.

there is an important legal aspect to consider here too.  let's assume
you're throwing a house part or a renegade, let's assume you're twenty years
old and you've carefully weighed the possible ramifications of intervention
by Big Brother for whatever reason.  You've considered that if the party is
shut down you run the risk of being fined or possibly detained, perhaps even
roughed up a bit by some ugly g-man.  okay....now consider the same party
where the cops walk in and notice that a significant percentage of the
attendees (or even one single person) appear to be under age.  and then find
naughty substances in the pockets of some of the attendees, or even some of
thoes younger people.  now the situation is totally different from a legal
standpoint, isn't it?  in addition to the fact that there may be other
specific ordinances, such as curfews, in effect in your community.

i'm not anti-kids, this is just something to consider.

friend, i think you'll find that there are a lot more people in this
community that have very similar backgrounds, and i think you'll find that
almost everyone who participates in raves does it for the reason you stated
above (walk away from anyone who does it for any other reason).

just be careful. (and that has nothing to do with your age, people that are
eight or eighty still need to be careful -- but especially in the party
world)

This party you r speaking of is a Muvment production.  I am good friends with
Kimyon, who runs Muvment. If you have ever been to one of his parties, then
you wouldn't be suprised.  Yes it is defanitly Arnold, Kimberly, or Willis. I
am not saying who, but it is one of them.  If you were at the last party he
threw, then you remember Ron Jeremy(yes the original porn star!).  It's all
about being different. I like the Idea that at these parties, u never know
what kind of weird shit might happen.
Different does not always equal bad.

Someone asked for a geriatric raver's opinion on the subject.  Here's what
I think:

What is termed "illegal" by the State implies that the State is wise
enough to determine what's right and wrong. 

They have it right with laws against murder and rape.  I'm not so sure
they are even close with the present mandates against cigarettes and pot. 
If you follow the history of why some of these laws exist, you'll realize
that it's pretty much about money and greed, not ethics and justice (ie
how much did the states attorneys general make off with last year -- $300 
billion?)

So . . . don't get caught up on "illegal" as a sole indicator of
just/unjust behavior.  In this respect, the fake id thing is harmless.  So
is smoking "underage".  If you end up blindly adhering to what reinforces
social norms, you'll never live a life worth living.  Dive head first into
the warm, soothing waters of a self created reality -- from my experience
there's nothing like it.

I agree with those who've mentioned that maturity is non-age related.
Hell, I'm old and still pretty immature!  :)

Hey, are any of you kids going up to Detroit for "Tight to Tighter" this 
Saturday instead of Dayton or G.B.B.?  (If you want more info on the 
party go to Midwest Raves at hyperreal...)

I was at a party a few weeks ago in D-town and mad kids told me they 
were going...Just in case any of you want a little change of scenery...


                         *hugs*

Can you even read?  The kid could just as well have taken pure
MDMA and had the exact same results. I did do some
research and found a case in California where some truly 'bad e' went
around. About 50 people got sick from the stuff, and the dealer went
to jail.  It's true that if he hadn't taken the stuff, he would probably 
still
be alive. Probably. Just possibly he could have been dumb enough to
dance himself into oblivion without the help of drugs.  Hell, better
ventilation and he woulkd still be alive, less crowd and he would still
be alive, if he had stayed home he would still be alive, No raves and
he would still be alive. Considering the number of people who do
ecstasy every week without serious side effects, it is still a 
reasonably
safe thing to do. When was the last death like this in this country that
anyone can remember?

I heard that it was gonna be at some Fairgrounds (I forget the name,
Jeannette?) that was illegal to have parties at. This is pure rumor, but
also in said rumor, since it's illegal to have parties at said fairground,
likelyhook of event getting shut down is high.

>whoever wrote that message to shayney saying that all 14 year-olds are too

They're an asshole is what I think you mean :)

>now where is the geriatric raver brigade?  no 30-somethings have anything
>to say about this?


Okey, I'm 31, and I have to agree with Braden, I'm old but not mature...
hell, at times I think I was more mature when I was 14... On the other hand,
why should I be mature? to make someone else happy? fuck that... maybe to
get a job? got a kick-ass job. Nope i cant find any reasons to be mature, or
anything that really links maturity to age.

I would think that in the Online community people would have gotten past the
age issue... there's so many times that I've had an online friend who was
really mature and I could have swore was 40 or so, and has turned out to be
13, and vise versa...

Whoever wrote the message about bigwheels, That's the immature asshole who
shouldn't be allowed at raves. Fucks like that give people a bad impression
of the scene. That person shouldn't be allowed to smoke, or even post email
without the supervision of someone with common sense and a bit of class.

That's all I have to say about that.

Dan

>> what's the latest lineup for saturday?

I'm not exactly sure, but I know someone who should have it in advance
enough time so that I can post it to the list.

In case anyone doesn't know, there is going to be an insane jungle battle
on EIGHT (yeah I said 8) turntables, with phantom 45 and danny the
wildchild (who is going to be in the DMC championships this year) vs
ground zero and someone else.  I never even heard of an event like this,
and I love scratchinga nd jungle, so needless to say I can't wait!

I talked to someone who said that Freaky Flow was going to be in philly
that night . . . can anybody confirm this rumor? If he is going to be in
philly, there is a chance that he will play there and then come to pgh
before the party ends.

About the fairgrounds . . . I believe it is going to be held at the
Fayette County fairgrounds.  I've never heard anything about raves not
being allowed to be held there . . . but anybody else know anything for
sure?

Its going to go from 4:20 on saturday to 7 o clock the next day.

Mike Finelli (for those that know him) is rumored to be spray painting
pieces for all the big DJs to announce their names of soemthing.

There's also supposed to be like five different music areas.

Some things that were going to happen but I'm not sure if they are still
in included are: a raffle where if you brign in a canned food you get a
ticket, and whoever is vending will raffle something off throughout the
night.  Also I've heard stuff about a room where you can bring spraypaint
or markers and just tag the fuck out of it.  (unless this is outdoors I
would think you could safely say that you should bring a heavy duty mask
if you want to spend any time in this rooms, cause the fumes will be
insane).  

Regarding the "who is going" post . . .I'll definitely be there.  I'm not
sure 

I think that's about it . . . .

Another kid who died at Virginia Tech a few months back dropped some E,
thought that he was going crazy and would kill people, and then ended up
having some kind of attack on his body and died.

Doctors found trace elements of four other drugs.  If you want to do
further research, i'm sure you can call the hospital.

Perhaps my point is that I personally know of two deaths in a very small
niche of this country within the past 12 months.  Perhaps.

Sorry to hear about the people you know. Strange that they were
both Va Tech students though. Perhaps something strange going
on there... ;-0
 Seriously though, how many people attend raves all
across the country every weekend? I'll make a rough estimate of
100,000. Does that sound too high or low? At most of the parties
I've been to and the people I talk to, over 50% of them are on one
drug or another during the course of the night. So by these figures
around 50,000 people a week are doing stuff at raves. If there 
is one death every three months at a rave somewhere in the US,
the mortality rate is 1 in every 600,000 uses of drugs at a rave. Even
with one death a month, it is still 1 in 200,000. How do other
activities compare to this? Not entirely sure, but the death rate
for childbirth is about 6 per 1000.
  It is a terrible thing when any young person(or anyone for that
matter) dies in a manner that could have been prevented. It's
up to each individual to decide what risks they are willing to take,
and keep themselves informed as to what the risk actually are.

i think this is the best strategy if you're underage. because when you're
at least 18 you can get anything you want pierced and nobody can say shit
to you, except maybe your boss, if they're assholes. also if you're
getting pierced by somebody who doesn't worry about the age of who they
are piercing, they're probably not caring about safety either. plus the
majority of people in high school change completely, as in tastes, when
they become more mature. not that i'm accusing anybody in particular on
the list of being immature, but i know this from personal experience. i
was totally immature in high school. so that's an important reason
especially concerning tattoos because you have to pay even more to get rid
of them then they cost, while you can take the jewelry out most piercings
and it heals with just a little scar. 

i got my inner conch (lower part of the hollow part of the ear. extremely 
painful, 14 gauge) pierced and a 2nd piercing in my lobe 3 months ago, now
i have 1 ring, with a cylindrical hematite bead, through both holes. i've
never seen anything like it on anybody else. it looks really cool.

i don't think i will be at getto booty battle because i'm getting more
surgery on friday. =(

Although I was very excited for the gbb earlier in the month, I later
decided not to go.  I am going to Iowa instead.  Damn, I just keep getting
deeper and deeper into the midwest!  Anyway, I hope everyone who's going
has A LOT of fun.  I hope everyone who's going is EXTREMELY careful.  From
what I understand, this party has been promoted into the far reaching
galaxy!  Have fun everyone.  Dance one for me.  Don't take any wooden
nickels.

Love ya,

Silly, it's part of the mystique!  It's part of the underground!  It's so
we won't get busted ahead of schedule (I love when Captain Picard says
that word)!  It's part of the fun of calling and having to get directions!
It's part of the challenge in getting there!!

Wahoo!  Long live the mystery!! (unless, of course, you have connections!)

ah, back to something we last discussed about a week ago ...

someone corrected me in my impression that the techno terrorists on cmu's
college radio actually do use the tables.  

my impression was otherwise because i sat in on one of their friday
nights, and the boy i was with told me that he usually just plays cd's.
just to clarify.  and try to redeem my credibility.

Hey all mah name is Moseley, I'm returning home after 4years from D.C.  I
guess you could say that I'm a little nervous about returning home.  I'm not
sure what to expect, but I hope that I can find a new family in oHIo.  I'm
sure I can.
By the way do N-E of you know a cute young grrl named LeaH that lives in the
Columbus area?  She visited here last summer and we had a g00d time!!   That
grrl could dance her (__l__) off.   Well hopefully I can find her and some O
you when I return home on the 23 or 24th.

Well I can't think of anything else to say right now.  SooOoo I'll C-ya'll
later.


Moseley

 I heard that it was gonna be at some Fairgrounds (I forget the name,
 Jeannette?) that was illegal to have parties at. This is pure rumor, but
 also in said rumor, since it's illegal to have parties at said fairground,
 likelyhook of event getting shut down is high.

I heard it was at the Irish Center...i find that very hard to believe
((especially because of the amount of space this event will need!!))...please
let me know its not true!!!!!!!

I don't know as far as GBB is concerned, but I do know that some 
parties are described as "basicaly a laser light show with a showcase 
of music and kids dancing" which is too far off..but if somebody 
finds out where a party is and calls the owner saying about the event 
they're renting for is one of those evil rave parties, that could put 
a damper on things...

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I

east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, i'd like some feedback on this?

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

all.

-

Taking you on an extended mindride:

the RICHIE HAWTIN experience
.Windsor, Canada.
-----
Minus is Richie's latest project, inspired by theories of subtraction,
advancement and experimentation.  These concepts are also driving forces

in one of his rare and innovative dj explorations.  Returning to make it

count in what will be one of only a few 98 U.S. appearances.  Capturing
all of our hearts and minds, get ready to let the man and his music take

control.

-

STEVE "SILK" HURLEY
.Chicago.
-----
Original groove master of Chicago house music responsible for classics
like "Jack Your Body".  A dj/producer/remixer/songwriter who has worked
with the likes of Prince, New Order, Madonna, Inner City, Janet &
Michael Jackson, Paula Abdul, Inner City and the list goes on.  From and

beyond the era of "jack" with a sound and style smooth as "silk" this
rare performance promises to be a legendary feature from a legendary
man.

-

Kanzleramt U.S. Tour :

The final stop of the tour.  Heiko, who is resident at the legendary
Omen club, and Johannes are two of the more prolific techno artists to
come out of the Frankfurt area in a long time.  And Slip leads the pack
in our neck of the woods.  Expect everything from hard, twisted techno
to subtle, deep techouse.

SAVAGE AURAL HOTBED  (live)
.Minneapolis.
-----
Feeding our oldest and most primal form of self expression - the dance -

in a most primal way.  An experience in tribal industrial performance
art that'll work you into a frenzy.  One man's junk is another man's
treasure - one man's pain is another man's pleasure - one man's symphony

is another man's savage aural hotbed!

-

FIERCE
.London.
-----
The No U-Turn posse is known to rip up dancefloors wherever they go with

a sound that is both scarily apocalyptic and funky as sex.  As one of
the most consistently exciting stables, the No U-Turn artists
represent!  This is the soundtrack of life in the future.

-

LAURENT HO
.Paris.
-----
Uncivilized World, Epiteth, SixSixtySix, Ingler, Industrial Strength
Beneath a beautiful city lies a destructive wall of sound - the sound of

L.Ho.  Known around the world for the quality hardcore he produces and
djing ability.  A man who loves his machines and the noises they make.

-

NATURAL BORN SUCKERS feat. Daria Black
.Montreal.
-----
Drop Bass Network
First time U.S. performance from a new DBN producer.  Described as the
Spiral Tribe sound, it is heavy and psychedelic.  Prepare to be drawn
into the speakers by the hypnotic style.  But don't feel too secure, it
could eat you alive at any moment.

-

KEVIN YOST
.small-town, PA.
-----
Guidance, i! Records, Nervous, Yellow
His talent as a producer is renowned worldwide, but Kevin is also a
respected up and coming dj.  In his first Midwest appearance he is sure

-

that has earned the respect of the world dj fraternity.  As a dj Pablo
delivers a unique mix of industrial and European trance.  First U.S.
appearance.

-

DAN EFEX
.Chicago.
-----
For years a favorite that never disappoints.  Well known for his smooth
mixing skills and ability to take you on a journey.  Dan is largely
responsible for trance music's favored status in the Midwest.

-

DREW YOUNG  (live)
.Milwaukee.
-----
UK44, Forever Forward, Amnesia
Another Midwestern trance aficionado.  Drew represents the live
performance side of things that put trance where it is in our area.
Expect his music aggressive yet beautiful.

-

TOP SPEED
.Indianapolis.
-----
This scratch o' matic was recently featured in hip hop's Source
magazine.  His cut n' flex battle dj performances have been generating
talk and attention everywhere he goes.  Witness.

-

TJ RICHTER
.Outer Space.
-----
This man/dolphin was seen naked under a cookie monster suit at Teenage
Wasteland.  Like a hopped-up funnycar on a drag strip TJ's performance
art is quite an ear & eye full.  On saturday night he will lead the
ceremony to light the Burning Man setting the night and himself on fire!

THEME CAMP and SOUND SYSTEM VILLAGE:
-----
New to Even Furthur this year is the creation of Theme Camps in the same

area as the DIY Sound System Village.  In an effort to create a more
surreal vision of our community, we are calling out for expression to
you who are creative.  Pristine river front campsites along the main
road of our campground will be reserved for individuals or groups who
want to create unique themed areas for themselves to live in and others
to visit.  These sites will also be home to the do it yourself sound
systems Even Furthur has become known for.  Do you have an idea for a
camp or a small sound system and some dj's/performers?  Leave a message
on the info line 414-777-3998 and we will call you to discuss it.  There

is a limited number of these sites available so call to reserve your
spot early!  This event is about our love of freedom and our belief in
the unique power of every individual.  Even if you don't want to create
a theme camp we encourage you to let your freak flag fly and sport
costumes, erect architecture, create artwork, invent games, play
drums/other instruments, or contribute performance art.  Lets make Even
Furthur all it can be and more...

Vendors will also be housed in the Theme Camp Village.  If you are
interested in vending please call 414-777-3998 to register.  You must
register in order to vend anything, no exceptions.  Sorry, no outside
food/beverage concessions will be allowed.

As always we are looking for past Even Furthur video footage...if you
have any or know someone who does please call 414-777-3998.  Your help
is greatly appreciated and you will be rewarded.

..............................................................+

FURTHUR GUIDELINES:
-----
Even Furthur takes place on a permitted rural setting for 72 straight
hours from noon Friday May 29th until Monday June 1st.  Don't forget
that this year the Monday of the festival is not the Memorial Day
holiday so you will need to take off from work or call in sick!
All official sound stages are weather protected and the main stage is in
a warehouse so the event goes rain or shine!  Come prepared to deal with
the possibility of bad weather - you know it's going to rain, it always
does.
-
Come prepared to camp and cope in an outdoor setting.  Things to keep
you happy include a sleeping bag, tent, food, plenty to drink, a
backpack, extra clothes, flashlights, grills, bug spray, sun block,
drums, toys, first aid and love, love, and more love to share with
everyone.

Jul 10-12               TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL                    Texas

[major far away, but really looks fun!!!!  WOo-HA! lots of camping for me
this summer!!!]

As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.

Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
"Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.

QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of raveyness,
then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

Hey, Jay, I just wanted to go public with this one.  

For those out there who don't know what I have been talking about with 
Jay, here it is: You gotta love this guy!   :)

The tapes are Promotional:  the sound isn't quality, if they were they 
would cost something, but they aren't so they don't.

Promoters are basically the ones who would want them anyway to hear what 
I play and how I play it, for listening enjoyment though, they are 
useless.

I offered a tape exchange for Jay, and he (this is sooo cute!)  Thinks 
he has to run out buy turntables and start mixing down tapes to send!  
Now you don't have to do that!  Certainly a tape is lying around 
SOMEWHERE, under the bed, in the sink someplace that he can make a copy 
and send.  I DON'T WANT THE ORIGINAL!  Too many tears are shed over the 
loss of those, so to help him out, I just want copies.

There is no ignorance involved just wanna save you time and grief!  
Ignorance is GIMMEE!  This is THE CUTENESS AWARD!  If ya heard of the 
BAD RAVER AWARD and seen one, THIS IS THE CUTENESS AWARD and he gets it!

                             :)  Cuteness Award
Only goes to the following person who is worthy of a Cuteness Award!
                               JAY
1.  Worries about the price of the tapes (close to 2 weeks of 
conversation and I have been telling him they are for free but GOSH DARN 
IT ANYWAY!  He STILL wants to give me something!

2.  Sweet guy is gonna try to Promote MY tape!  :)  (cuteness plus)

3.  Thinks (you gotta love this!) because he is not a Promoter I am NOT 
gonna send a tape!  Holy heck!  Jay that would be a TOTAL BAD RAVER 
AWARD FOR ME!  Of course you are gonna get the tapes, I am sitting right 
here, with them right now, and when I am done answering all the nice 
boys and girls I will mail them out so do not pout! :(

4.  I even offered for HIS NICENESS to be HIS PERSONAL DJ!  What a deal!  
How many people would I offer that to?  (yeah yeah I hear ya DJ KALI 
would go with ANYBODY so damn desperate to give out tapes even!)

This is an award not everyone gets, this guy was the only one who wanted 
to give me something!  That is not to say I want ANYTHING, but he was 
the only person I got so far that actually cared.

For the real Promoters, though, they are exempt because they are 
Promoters, tapes are like Resumes' that is just the way it is.  They
usually don't give you anything for the tape but a chance, and that is 
what is to be expected.  It is a business, and a professional one.  

End of Cutness Award dude, print it out and hang it on your wall, and
show it off to everyone who comes in!

Peace Out,
DJ KALI

Jay this is DJ Kali and I can only provide tapes.  If I still had
my car BIG RED, I would give you a ride, but since His death was in
1996 it just can't be done.  

If I find out anything or anyone who will take you, I will let you know, 
but right now, there isn't much I can do.

I hope you find someone fast!

Enjoy your Award!    :)
DJ KALI

If it were Janet Jackson I would camp out in front of the promoters house
for a week until it was time to pick her up at the airport.  I'd also spin
all their parties free. :)

So who is it?  What is eveyones guess?  I say Dana Plato because I saw her
on a talk show recently and she is kind of a hippie now.  She would be open
minded enough to enjoy herself.

Hi Andy, this is DJ Kali, I didn't know a WarGames sample was on there!  
(What is a WarGames?)  I use the samples already placed in the songs.  
Here is a method that I use. 

1.  Interrupts.  When a part goes longer than say so many seconds, you 
can place a sentence in there, or start on another song completely, just 
make sure you line things up.  Can you make a sentence fit?  Sometimes 
you have to shorten it, but it can still make sense.

2.  Sound effects:  A droning surreal sound comes on, what could be 
better than a BLIP, or FIZZ or another sound effect?

3.  Make a story.  If you have a song about war, how many other war 
songs can you find and make it all sound good?  This is what I called 
Theming.

4.  Breaks:  Not like break beat but totally freak out the listener by 
placing in such a freaky thing like an unexpected noise, sentence, or
saying.  Use samples that are used in the songs.  The best have no 
background sound to them.  Just a plain sentence works!

For your other question, no I don't use drugs, had no interest in them.  
If I feel happy, I wanna KNOW I am happy.  If I feel sad or something I 
wanna KNOW I feel sad or something, and hopefully the party will help me 
think out a solution.

I agree with the ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT like they say, if it ain't broke 
don't fix it, or even TRY to improve it.  If you let all your goofy 
thoughts, and disturbing giddiness settle down, did ya know you can 
access your Pychic Awareness.  Try this.  You go down your street.
Now, there is a road, can you sense ANYTHING COMING UP FROM THAT ROAD?
Or when driving:  Will someone from a sidestreet be coming up soon?
Give yourself a 3 foot distance or so, I used this when walking down
streets late at night, and I have never been wrong.

Dungeons and Dragons makes you pay so many silver pieces I found out to 
get this awareness.  Actually it comes for free, but being SO GROWN UP, 
we forgot to use this.  It can be re-accessed with practice.  

How about when you get lost in a FOG CLOUD at a party, is there someone 
there you might accidentally hit while dancing or are you clear?  
Chances are if in the right mood, you won't hit anyone or anything, you 
will automatically know if they are there or not!

Try it! :)

Original is better!

DJ KALI a.k.a. K.

Hey Viktor, this is DJ Kali, and I am glad you liked the card!  How 
about the picture of the cake shaped like a WAREHOUSE!  Dream come true!

Yeah, I HAVE TO GO TO SUB PHUNC 27!  I mean miss out on a GOOD PARTY?
Bootie Battle I can miss, Digital Genesis I heard is $30.00 and is going 
to be like a concert (stand and stare at the 2 DJ's)  Oh Pleeeze!  No, I 
can't say who told me, I'd be tracked down and probably never seen 
again.  Let us just say I know things, see things, and can't say who 
tells me things, except that I am on the side of GOOD PEOPLE and not 
shady ones.  I am the thorn in the Corporate Techno side of life.  I am 
what most Prissy Listners of Techno fear.
I play Hardcore that is enough.

But to miss out on SUB PHUNC 27? NEVER!  Dude, I have that written in 
gold on my calendar!  You should see it!  BIG TOO!

Happy Birthday and I'll bring a nifty gifty!
DJ KALI a.k.a. K.

I am just speaking of Pittsburgh when I say Renegade, I am not sure 
where you folks live, but in some states they can be an unwelcomed 
event.

Thing is, there is a person I know you can talk to about throwing such 
an event.  Contact me at 1-412-260-0066 and I can give you their number.  

Hopefully, it will be fun, and not get busted, and I wouldn't worry if 
it is in an area that is secluded and away from houses and stuff.  We 
used to do ours under the WEST END BRIDGE!  Was that fun!  :)

Hey contact me soon, it might work out, this person knows how to do 
things right!

DJ KALI  a.k.a. K.

(Ya know, I would say names but knowing my luck, it wouldn't be 
appreciated, so I have to be secretive, and I don't like it and I am 
sure you don't either, but why start something up?  I mean maybe this 
person wants privacy!  I mean maybe they AREN'T ready to do Renegades!
I don't wanna say they do when they don't, and for the other folks I 
can't mention when it comes to Digital Genesis, let us just say I am on 
their side, and I can't be in any connection to it.  So I am not going!  
Goodie!  I can save $30.00!  Put it toward that mini-disk, make some 
REALLY GOOD TAPES!)

secluded and secretive the way I should be:

 Just a note if your gonna buy E NEVER BUY CAPSULES especially if U don't know
the person.Its so easy for some idiot to just put a bunch of crap in a cpsule
and say yeah its E.Im my younger stupid drug infested days I rember I bought a
capsule of "E" I dunno what wuz in it but the next day slime wuz comming out
of my eyes and black splotches started appearing on my arms!!!! Go ahead tell
me how stupid I wuz i already know.But if your gonna take E BUY IT FROM
SOMEONE U KNOW.And I'd say u have a slightly better chance of gettin a safer
pill if its pressed rather than in a capsule.Just don't do any drugs of course
is your safest bet.

Does anybody know who is on the front of the CRUSH flyer (this goes out
especially to the alephlabs guys), cause a friend of mine said he got the
flyer from the girl that is on the front of it!  

Umm . . . also the flyer has an extra added bonus.  For those of you that
haven't seen it yet, there is a picture of a blond haired blue eyed girl
of just a rectangle from the top of her forehead to the bottom ofher
nose.  Now if you take this flyer and put it over right in front of your
face pointing away from you, it is like a mask but you can still move
your mouth, and it is absolutely hilarious!  Kind of like a getto version
of that shit they do on conan o'brian.  This may be kind of silly, but
once you try it you'll understand.  

ABSOLUT

Ps-I send way to many messages to this list :)

OK, here's the deal:

The infoline for the GBB is 1-800-325-9203 but that isn't all there is
too it . . . it is more than in infoline . . . it is an active-infoline. 
Which means that someone will be answering the phone and talking to you
personally.  I'm sure they can't do this 24 hours untill the day of the
party of anything, but if noone's there they will have voice mail.

The deal with the location is: it is at the fayette county fairgrounds. 
What people said about events being shutdown before isn't true because
there has never been an event here before.  She said she just signed the
contract last night and gave them the money to completely finalize the
plans, and they've neer seen an event like this before.  I asked if they
knew it was going to be all night and if that was cool, and she said that
yeah, they knew and that she needed to get special clearance for it
because of that . . . so its all good and legal.

I also alsked about the insane jungle battle, and I didn't talk to her
extensively about it because she had to go and answer another call, but i
got the impression it would be two people mixing at all times, with the
two teams tagteaming.
It seems amazing to me that she could pull this off, because rather than
spending X amount of money to get Y amount of hours . . . she is spending
X amount of money and getting Y / 4 amount of time.

Tix are going to be $25 at the door (I had heard somewhere else they
would be $30.

Excellent advice. I gave up on buying capsules a while ago. Unless
they let me taste it, of course.

I got the same thing pierced about 6 months ago and it still hurts

It does look cool though:) And it did hurt like hell too get it done.

Peace,
Luke

Agreed, any fool can go into GNC and buy empty capsules, and put anything
they want into them. I woouldnt buy a capsule from someone unless I trusted
htem enough to say let them borrow my car, or stay at my house when I wasnt
there etc... on the other hand if you got like 3 or 4 diff kinds of E, it
can be cool to crush them all up, buy some capsules from GNC, and mix up
your own brew... I did that for april foolz...

peace, love, unity, and respect.

After that if you're still bored, check out cafe sip in shadyside, corner of
spahr and ellesworth, I think they quit at 2am or so... also , if you're
into drinking etc, I think ZEMO or 7up may be playing at metropol's private
lounge, I'm not positive about this tho, I'll know for sure later on
tonight. If interested send me email and I can fix it so you can get in.

Have fun

Hahaha! Yeah, we ravers better laugh now, but we'll be crying the next
time we go to book a space for a big event like April Foolz. It may seem
funny to read the obviously exaggerated reports (I hope!) in the media,
but this kind of story will only add fuel to the fire. 

Personally, I am horrified to read about this kid's death. Horrifed at
the loss of his young life, that it happened at a rave, and that any
drugs you could buy at a rave could be that lethal! (Call me naive). 

It sounds like the combo of the high heat, hard to breath air and drugs
was what killed him, not just the drugs. The first tow are aspects that
promoters have complete control over when booking spaces. If there is no
A/C, then rent plenty of HUGE commercial fans! 

I feel as if somehow there must be something our scene can do to begin
policing ourselves and teaching those who attend our events about
responsible/smart ways to party. Older, more experienced ppl need to do
their best to "school" the younger ones. 

There is going to be a "Scene Conference" out here in the central states
area (in conjunction with the Cygnus Loop party in Lincoln, Nebraska,
May 9). This is exactly the kind of things they need to be talking about
and looking for answers to. I'm going to take copies of some of the
articles and posts to read to everyone. 

I just have one final question. Were the needles and syringes from the
ravers or did the media/cops just find the kids a convenient scapegoat?
I sincerely _hope_ shooting up is not that popular on the scene. It's
bad enough to watch what meth, coke and K can do to the scene, now we
have shooting up coming back into vogue??? God, I hope not!!!!

This whole thing makes me realize how lucky we are out here where drugs
have not "taken over" the scene. 

Sad story. . .

Does anyone know what these blue capsules were called and could you give
a more complete description (color, size, etc.)?? Some blue capsules
were going around here at the last party. They came via Detroit (and
supposedly Canada before that), so it's possible they could be the same
ones. Some ppl I know bought some. In case they can't taste the
difference before taking them, it would be nice to know if there were
some identifying characteristics . . . help, anyone??!

My bet's on Willis. I know he was a professional break dancer way back
when. I read it in a book, and it had the picture to prove it too. I forgot
the name of it though if anybody was curious. Maybe he'll start up a 
circle, *shrug*. Just thought i'd share that useless information.
peace, luv, 'n' beats..........
