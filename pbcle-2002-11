Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} haunted HOUSE at havana

got to say thanks to everyone that came out last night to Havana!  I've been 
doing this at Havana for close to 3 years now and it just keeps getting 
hotter.  Thanks to Nina and Fred for the help promoting.  Thanks to the DJs 
for the great sets.  Thanks to all of the local sponsors who donated tons of 
money for prizes ... and big thanks to the live musicians who add so much 
flavor to the night - we'll be bringing them back - Live Bongos, Trumpet, 
Trombone and Flute - it was crazy!!

I'm only sorry that the place isn't bigger - we had to shut the doors at 
about 12:30am because of reaching fire code capacity.  Alot of heads don't 
understand this rule and there were some angry people left standing outside 
in the cold ... but whatever.  Go to any other city and you will wait to get 
into a club.  We do our best to keep it moving and let people in as people 
go out.

next week - no cover - iPhunk preparty with Osmotic and Coalesce.
See you there.

Thanks,
Jason C
havana

have you seen U-Turn? Anyone that hasn't really should... it was the first movie Oliver Stone made after NBK (I think...) and the next closest thing. Even better than NBK, in my opinion.

Subject: {pb-cle} weeklies calendar, promoters/lighting/sound/VJ listings, member links

i've gone thru all the weeklies listings, promoters etc listings & member
listings and spiked any that were DOA.

so if you have something that should be on there, double check the links.

some of the weeklies were iffy so i left them on, so if people could
double check them?

well, i just saw a commercial for what could be the dumbest rave related =
television program ever.

in the next samurai jack on cartoon network jack goes "undercover" in a =
rave. or in other words he puts a pacefier in his mouth and wears baggy =
pants while fighting a kung fu dj.


this looks like it's going to be either the funniest thing i've ever =
seen... or it's going to make me punch myself in the face.

i didn't catch when it's going to be, i never watch that show. but they =
run advertisements for the show constantly so i'm sure i'll see it again =
soon.

or stay at home, pick your favorite 3 CDs and sit and listen to

fuck deejays.

What's this "rave" thing you speak of..?
-----------------------------

it's a thing in the middle of the woods where evil music turns children into
kung fu electrocash zombies.



my favorite part had to be when the sound system came together and formed a
mecha with the DJ sitting at the controlls spinning records. i hate when
that happens! it always ruins the vibe of a good party!!!

  well, i just saw a commercial for what could be the dumbest rave related
  television program ever.

  in the next samurai jack on cartoon network jack goes "undercover" in a
  rave. or in other words he puts a pacefier in his mouth and wears baggy
  pants while fighting a kung fu dj.


  this looks like it's going to be either the funniest thing i've ever
seen...
  or it's going to make me punch myself in the face.

Subject: {pb-cle} Last night's WYEP set

I managed to catch most of the set last night during a random night drive
to the middle of nowhere (though now at least I know how to get to
Puxsatawney now).

There was a one track that I didn't catch the name/artist for that I need
to get. It was during Count Zero's set, played around 3AM, and had lyrics
that sounded like they were written by Val Kilmer's character from Real
Genius:

"subatomic particles racing through my veins..."
"faster...faster...I must go faster faster..."

Assistance appreciated, and really nice set overall there.

Danke,

We are still looking for promoters in cities on the East Coast/Midwest to book the Invasion Planete North American Tour to take place late March of 2003.  If you or someone you know may be interested please contact me.  Further info Below. I am back online now but will be makeing myself scare from events for a while as I concentrate more on personal studio time and the record labels.  I will however be djing an electro set at "the big techno rave party" Bump3 in Cleveland on Nov22nd.  More info soon.  I will also have a new electro mix cd available later this month featureing some test presses from our generous zombie nation bretheren over in Holland from Creme/Bunker. One last thing if anyone is in need of a new computer I am offering my services to build custom pc systems for a very low price.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Digweed at Moda

It all makes sense now! Moda doesn't want any public announcements on PB-CLE aka ROM because they know thats where the "smart" kids are *aka* pb-cle listees are dwelling who knows that 40 bucks is better to be spent on getting your drink on - and after that 5th or 6th drink -that dj isn't so bad feeling - at a local spot .. but people who listen to the radio 96.5 only know these "supposed" TOP DJS from essential mix cd's and crazy rave movies. lol ...

I wonder if he requested that mixer.  Rotaries do give you more precide
control over sound levels.  Those old uri's had rotary volume controls and
no crossfaders.  If you think that rotary looks good check out this one.

You mentioned A&H.  They did just recently release a rotary mixer as well.
Its almost too old school for me though.  It has no crossfader and the eq is
global (although it has 1 highpass filter per channel).  Although I'm sure
the sound quality is superb.  Its sick for sure.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Halloween pics from Groove


the xone:64 is a sick mixer...the eqs are tits...in fact most of the clubs 
in europe that are upgrading sound are spec'ing the 64 or the 464...i know 
fabric was a test site for that xone...i also know that ritchie hawtin specs 
a 464 on his contracts...its funny how most americans are always so far 
behind the europeans on things like this...i guess most american dj's would 
rather have effects than a sonically accurate mixer...that rotary a-h looks 
sick...but i dont think i could live with the global eqs(it probably has a 
$2000 price tag too)...global eq's require godlike skill in the mix and 
intimate knowledge of all your records to make everything sound right

fucking stupid. 

>global eq's require godlike skill in the mix and

i dont know about all of that. it does require some knowledge of
how your records bass and drums come in, but thats about it.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


I just came back to Cleveland after a half year hiatus and was wondering if there is still a drum & bass night on Wednesday nights in Cleveland?  When I left, it was at Spy Bar, but then I heard it moved to Wish.  Is there still currently a d&b night at Wish on Wednesdays and is Wish on the same street as Spy?  Thanks in advance.. 

                                                                                                         -Sore

I'll comment...thats total bullshit. "patrons of a disorderly house with 
controlled substances?" What a crock! Seems to me a guy who is sitting in 
the dentists office, while two hoodlums are ripping pages out of the waiting 
room magazines, fits that loose terminology. Blecch!

Subject: {pb-cle} Protect our events and our friends

If police show up, have a few video camera's available
with people or hide them away....

This could cause a danger to yourself and what may
take place at your event, but if used with inteligence
one can use a camera as a powerful weapon to fight
back.  

Consider your options, have your word against the 5-0
or have some kind of documented footage of what "takes
place".  Make them show they had proper cause to
enter.  
This is where it gets a little more helpful...
   a.  Law enforcement does not have allowance to
"bust" an event if a riot might be caused by their
form of entry.  Most of the time they start quietly,
but we all have seen otherwise as well.  Although, BE
CAREFUL, a riot may be what they are looking to
insite.  The camera may sound a little hazardous, but
pending on the rave act, when they start busting,
camera's of their own will be there as well; setting
the example for those who also plan to be a part of
the "raves" which are "SOO ILLEGAL"
   b.  When large groups are restrained inside an
enclosed area, there still must be proper fire exits
to support the group inside.  Closing off an area and
not allowing exit can be considered entrapment and
cause extreme danger to those inside.  Analogy:  what
does confined to one area, surrounded by the same
people for an extended period of time and you are all
thinking the same thing, "when the hell am i gonna get
outta here".  Do you see what I am getting at.  

This is basic protection of ones civil liberties which
is often violated, almost on a daily basis by "crime
fighters" everywhere.  How can we fight this act if
passed; this is a simple concept which we all should
pay significant attention to.  Protect our scene, what
is truely left of the underground and protect our
music.      
"The Grateful Dead" is a perfect example, back in the
day of Jerry, it came to the point that a grateful
dead sticker or wearing a tie-dyed T from the band
would be considered probable cause to search.  I cant
imagine anyone wants that to happen here.

Will come back soon with more info on protecting our
events and those that keep it real.  This is personal
knowledge, guidance and recommendations from the legal
profession will be commin VERY SHORTLY

Vote yes on ISSUE 1 people

Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect 
Brian
aka 3-ball

p.s.  If anyone else has help in this situation,
please share the knowledge.

No, but I should probably add it to the collection.

About 80's --> techno, look at it this way...   most old school hip-hop =
producers (and most current) grew up on 70's funk, soul, and r&b,... so =
look what gets sampled most.

With current 'techno' producers, the 80's electro and euro-pop were =
probably major influences...   but since 'techno' lends itself better to =
straight remixes rather than obscure samples,...  viola...!

Subject: {pb-cle} research paper (ugh)


So, for British Lit. I have to do a research paper basically on anything 
relating to England and I really want to do something involving British 
music (NOT THE BEATLES!!) or the early rave scene and how it affected either 
society or modern music/rave culture. The only problem, of course, being 
that I'm dumb and clueless... any suggestions?

It was kept off my record. We were all very angry, but there was nothing we could do about it. Technically we WERE wrong. If no one heads out and supports the events with hundreds of people and open drug use, then you won't have a problem.

rave is dead

Yes, Please don't write the paper on the rave scene.  Go get yourself a 
good grade and write it on winston churchill.

Plus, its not like you are going to find any reputable references on the UK 
rave scene.  That alone would get you a bad grade, if your teacher has any 
brain in their head anyway.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} research paper (ugh)

well instead of writing it on the rave scene...you could write a paper oh 
how in the uk in the late 80s and early 90s electro turned into acid house 
turned into hardcore melded with dancehall reagge and hiphop split into drum 
and bass and happycore...that alone could be 40 pages worth of history...you 
could use discography's as references and various news clippings from scene 
mags...you could drop lots of names...tell how the various crews got in the 
game...explain the differences between the genres...hell you could even burn 
a cd with different tracks on it and hand that into your prof with the 
article telling him/her to play a certain track when he/she gets to a 
certain paragraph to hear the difference in the music...the resources are 
out there...it just would take some dedicated surfing...

music has alot to do with liturature in my opinion...music is just another 
form of poetry

I think that's where the phrase "tell it to the judge" comes from.
Basically they fuck you and then its up to getting a judge to dismiss the
ridiculous charges.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: I'm not going to comment, just pass this along.

Not only do they set a precedent, they are encouraging to a HUGE degree that 
other cop shops do it. Just for arguments sake, lets take the $100, 300 
people, and 90% waive rate for granted...

   THATS $27,000 IN A NIGHT!!!

There may be some reputable law enforcement spots out there, but even they 
would be "stupid" to pass up a chance to bring in thousands of dollars for 
various operating and vehicle capital. That kind of shit could buy them a 
decked out new cruiser every single week.

The little people like us don't stand a chance, but a collective or a group 
like the ACLU might. Remember when the cops were handing out all those 
jaywalking tickets in Pgh last year for $90 each. People went ape shit and 
they lowered the fine to $15.

Sure, public opinion is going to differ from jaywalkers to ravers, but the 
fact remains that the jaywalkers actually did something wrong while the 
ravers were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

This is an outrage, but I have no idea how one would go about getting the 
ball rolling to make this stuff stop.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: I'm not going to comment, just pass this along.

i never thought of the math...well the rave act just made a whole lot more 
sense to me now...it would make sense to pass legislation like that because 
it would legalise shit like that...i bet if you look at the records of any 
the bill authors' home districts you see something like what happened in 
detroit happening...except someone did take the ticket to court and 
won...this will just legalise police extortion(which is what this is all 
boiling down too)...it seems law enforcement is keen to make money anyway 
they can now...riddle me this...i live in parma ohio....anyone from the 
cleveland area knows how notorious the parma police(or the border patrol as 
i like to call them)is...in parma they will pull you over for just about 
anything they can...shake you down, run your id, and try to find more 
offences...in fact...the police have a deal going with the with their 
officers...take an extra traffic shift...write 8 tickets...and regardless of 
how long you were out you get paid 8 hours of overtime...

1984 was only 18 years off i think...scarey to think the repubilcans have 
total control of this country for 2 years too...thats right...the white 
house, both houses of congress, and the supreme court...there are about 20 
or so federal judges that are going to be appointed too now...they were 
being held up by a liberal senate...which all means...less liberties for 
us...more power/control for the federal gov't...and just to think the 
republican party was for more power for the states...and less control by the 
federal gov't...when the faction was termed during first few 
presidencys...how things change...i wouldnt be surprised if we goto war 
after thanksgiving...nothing like a war to get ppl out and shopping for 
xmas...what with all the advertising they'll be shoving down our throats on 
the news channels...i read somewhere that fox, nbc, and cnn sold speculative 
advertising to lots of corporations that would run only if we went to war...

sorry i got long winded...

I thought ppl that started tha whole club-kid, raver style and lifestyle dressed up a lot... I remember about Michael Alig and tha Limelight crowd and all, they always got crazy with their attire.

So technically, Halloween and raves go hand in hand... no wonder Majick was always so special.

yes this is true...but id rather have liberals spreading the wealth around a 
bit more than conservatives that want to keep the rich rich and the poor 
poor...dont get me wrong...i know 90% of politicians are currupt as 
hell...it just seems to me that the democrats are a bit more willing to let 
ppl have fun...and arent slamming all kinds "conservative values" down our 
throats...

id like to knock up a bush daughter to see if that changes his stance on 
abortion...i hear they like to get drunk...and probably have the same taste 
for our columbian friend as thier father...of course...it would probably 
mean castration for me

you can't just go around assuming teachers are smart! She specifically said

Since New Years falls on a Tuesday you can expect the Control the Night and 
Quantum Bass collective to have something in store for you.  We are looking 
along the lines of a live band, food, drinks, great local DJs and a 
headliner.  As always this event will be low priced.  Keep learned at

really good time there. I wouldnt mind going to check it out, but havent
gotten the chance to yet. Are there locals playing at Moda, or do they have
a different out look going on?..

If you notice men in black suits driving late model V8s following you
around,
don't question why they're there or what they're after. :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Digweed at Moda

Moda currently has two residents.  DJ Shell and Sammy O.  Both are in that
proggy sort of vein.  Shell touches more on the trance side of it while
Sammy stays closer to the house side.   Sammy plays one weekend a month, and
Shell plays when there is not a headliner.  Normal cover charge is $10, and
for the guests it is relevant to how much they payed.   They have a base
charge, and then a seperate admission to the VIP.  A table in the VIP will
cost you between $200 and $600 + tax and gratuity and maybe more for new
years eve.  The drink prices are about a $1.50 cheaper than mercury and
about $.50 cheaper than Spy.  The club is very dope in many ways, but the
traffic flow is awkward I think.  The bars surround the dancefloor.. and
from a djs standpoint that is never good.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Thu Nov 21            SYMBIOSIS: Live Art/Music Auction     Antioch College

"Symbiosis: Live Art/Music Auction"
Thursday, November 21st - 6pm until 2am
Birch Space @ Antioch College - 450 Corry St, Yellow Springs, Oh 45387

Symbiosis, defined in biological terms, is a mutually beneficial
relationship that exists between two or more organisms living in close
proximity or contact. You are cordially invited to witness as both
students and faculty from Antioch College create their own manifestations
of symbiosis in artistic terms - a stunning interaction between art and
music. The art and music are performances themselves, the spontaneous
creation of various mediums of art simultaneous to both live and DJ
musical performances encompassing a broad range of music.

At the end of each performance, an auction will be held that provides the
rare opportunity for the audience to acquire both the original art and
recordings of the music that was just experienced. All proceeds will
directly benefit the Performing Arts Committee at Antioch College.

Of Art:
Professor Chris Garcia (ceramics & sculpture)
Ally Adduci (oils)
Sara Duda (acrylics)
Erin Ford (ceramics)
Bryan Heidel (4-D mixed media)
Daniel Marks (sculpture)
Kyle McCann (ceramics)
the Antioch Media Collective (film and video)

Of Music:
the Beast (bluegrass)
Dr. Falafel w/ Method Moyle (breaks/hiphop dj w/ mc)
erth (live psychedelic trance)
Mo Mizuho (violin & voice)
Prodjeckd Grande Omega Minus (glitch/idm)
the Quartet (post-rock)
Reverberber (glitch/idm)
Will Robinson (live groovy breakbeats)

This event is open to the entire community. Entrance is free of charge.
Please be aware that access to the Antioch campus is restricted to the
Birch Space. Wandering, loitering, and any form of disrespect will not be
tolerated. Positive interactions and bidding on the auctions will be
encouraged.

Please contact daniel at 937.769.1027 during business hours for additional
information or email at dmarks@antioch-college.edu. MapQuest supplies
comprehensive directions. The Birch Space is located 1/4 mile south of the
intersection of 68/Xenia and Corry St on the right. The Birch Space is the
ground floor section below the dormitories.

Bio:
Steve Lawler is a definitive DJ and producer: a tastemaker whose sets 
combine quality house music with the power to move dance floors around the 
world. In the last few years, he's ignited crowds in the worlds best clubs 
such as Zouk in Singapore, Space in Miami, Twilo in New York, Pacha in 
Buenas aires and the mighty Space in Ibiza. Courtesy of home in the summer 
of 1999 and 2000, he provided the groundbreaking sets of the season for 
many of those lucky enough to hear him. Just after the first two months he 
had been crowned 'King Of Space' by the locals - a rare and well deserved 
honor. For over a year, Lawler set the capital alight with his weekly 
Friday night residency at Deepsouth at home. I f you were lucky enough to 
catch one of his 6 hour sets, you'll know exactly what it felt like as he 
weaved his magic across the club's sound system, wowing clubbers and 
critics alike. In Febuary2001, Steve decided to finish his stint at home 
due to overwhelming demand for his skills across the UK, and farther a 
field to the USA and the rest of Europe.

Sat Nov 30                    ROCK THE BELLS 2                       Dayton

Wishing Well and Groovefuel Recordings, on Saturday November 30th, bring 
you.......

"Rock the Bells 2, The Second Ringing" featuring the following djs and/or 
acts........


Donald_Glaude ( Moonshine Records, Eden Records ) Los Angeles, California
A veteran DJ for over 15 years, Donald Glaude has cemented his reputation 
as a crowd-rocking favorite and one of the most in demand artists in the 
country. He is one of those rare DJs who perceives their role to be that 
of an all-around entertainer and performer. He exudes energy, dropping 
track after funky track, arms aloft, and has been known to join the 
dancers on the floor. Join us at Rock the Bells 2 to witness the man DJ 
Dan considers "one of the most entertaining DJs in America to watch live." 
__________________________________________________

Huge Surprise Orlando Breaks dj to be announced seconds before he takes 
stage. This guy has accomplished many things in the breaks world and 
people all over are playing his records. His blend of progressive and 
funky breaks will leave you in awe and wanting more, he flat out rocks the 
decks, and has done it in Dayton before.
__________________________________________________

UF0_! ( Phunkatech Records, Phylum Recordings, Circa ) New York City
Featured in magazines such as URB, XLR8R, Lotus, Mixmag, Knowledge, and 
many other 'zines, UFO! is one of the most sought after producers in the 
United States. Record labels across the country clamor for a UFO! remix, 
which guarantees a dance floor hit. A Bay Area native, UFO! pioneered the 
San Francisco Drum and Bass scene and co-founded the much respected 
Phunckateck collective, creating a new community in music. Now residing in 
New York City he is rocking more crowds then ever.
__________________________________________________

Charly ( Bassdrive, Well Known Djs ) Philadelphia
Spinning around the East Coast over the past few years has gained Charly 
the reputation for clean sets, crazy mixes, and an incredible vibe behind 
the decks. Headlining around the country with UFO!, Juan Atkins, DJ Seen, 
and AK1200, has earned, as well as provided, Charly immense respect. Once 
Charly is seen in action, it's easily understood why she has been touted 
to be the next best thing for the US Drum-n-Bass Scene. At the young age 
of only 18 she is sure to be the next superstar in drum and bass.
__________________________________________________

Trevor_Lamont ( NateFx, Soulbrothaz, Aliensquad ) Lexington KY
Trevor is one of the most respected and skilled DJs in the Midwest and is 
never to be missed as you might miss something spectacular. His experience 
reflects on his sets as he can always work the crowd with his soulful 
house music and break it down to its roots.vs.Samm-e ( Soulbrothaz, U.S. 
Hispanix, House Purists, Dr. Sun Prod, Senor MTSU ) Murfreesboro
Samm-e is one third of the nationally acclaimed Teamsters crew consisting 
of him, Halo, and Trevor Lamont. When he hits the decks there is a vibe 
that comes over the room and with him on two while T is on two, things 
could get crazy, and memorable.
__________________________________________________

Guy_Smilee ( www.gagproductions.com, www.neutralmusic.net ) Rochester, New 
York
Guy Smilee is one of the most popular happy hardcore djs in the US and 
with Jumper by his side they always bring the house down. Guy can scratch 
with about any part of his body, and make sure you watch on November 30th 
as you can see him in action. Like I said Jumper will be by his side and 
you all know he can rock it and let's show him how much we love him in 
Ohio. w/ Mc_Jumper ( GAG, Ruffneck Playaz Crew, www.neutralmusic.net ) 
Rochester, New York
__________________________________________________

Big Regional Surprise Act to close out the main room and rock it for an 
hour. These guys have been ripping it for a year now and have been ripping 
it all together for about 2 years. They made their debut last year on 
December 15th and will be closing out the main room at 5 with a set to be 
remembered for a lifetime.
__________________________________________________

Kid Chaos ( In the Groove, Infinity Prod )
This house music enthusiast is always a hit on the dancefloor. His fusion 
of disco house and groovy tech-house has helped him gain recognition 
throughout the midwest and get him on lineups with names such as Too 
Short, Sandra Collins, and more.
__________________________________________________

HE10 ( In The Groove ) Tucson, Arizona
Coming to us all the way from Tucson he is ready to throw down the dopest 
uplifting trance we have seen in a long time. The awesome track selection 
and flawless mixing will bring him back to our city more often, hopefully.
__________________________________________________

Mike_Donovan ( Bounce Theory, Scarab Records ) Dayton, Ohio
Mike is co-founder of the Bounce Theory in Dayton Ohio. Deep tech-house 
music for the sophisticated listener featuring smooth, deep, jazzy 
grooves. He will be promoting his new cd Paint the Town Redd so be close 
to the decks and you might get a copy.
__________________________________________________

Chromix_live pa ( Groovefuel Recordings, Do:Loop Records ) Cleveland
This Northern Ohio progressive and hard trance producing phenomenon has 
been writing tracks since the age of 15. His unique and powerful live set 
will leave you begging for more and make sure you watch out for his first 
release on Groovefuel Recordings later this year.
__________________________________________________

Matthew_Kelly ( 4-Score Productions, Katatonic Resident ) Nashville
This crazy scratching breaks master representing Nashville will make his 
first Wishing Well appearance and a long awaited one at that. Make sure to 
catch his set as his whole crew including Michelle make it up from 
Nashvegas.
__________________________________________________

Clay-Born ( Wishing Well, Breakline Crew ) Louisville
Clay is always bringing a new crate of records and a totally awesome 
performance to every event which keeps his sets fresh and new and the vibe 
totally flowing to the deep basslines and dirty beats that make up 
nu-skool breaks.
__________________________________________________

Foursqare ( Wishing Well, Metronomix ) Louisville
Last year around this time a dj was born to the scene to show everyone how 
to rock it, Foursqare style. The dope ass house sets she drops are enough 
to make people like Paul Johnson and other house legends say WHOA!!! 
__________________________________________________

e21 ( :SCENE:, Stellar Gruve ) Atlanta
The man behind SCENE Ohio made his first Wishing Well debut at the last 
Rock the Bells and rocking it this year will be no different. The trance 
selections he brings to the table are amazing and his attitude towards the 
music and his presence on stage show it all.
__________________________________________________

Nero_X ( Hypnotik Therapy ) Cincinnati
You thought you wouldn't hear the techno but what party is a party without 
techno. Get there early to hear this man bring it hard. Dino is an up and 
coming superstar in the Ohio scene so look out for him whenever you can.
__________________________________________________

Jigglypuff ( Independent ) Cincinnati
If you thought Guy Smilee was enough happy hardcore for the night you were 
totally mistaken because this guy will bring it in early to set the vibe 
and the night off on the right foot. Let the man we call Chester know how 
much we love him and be right next to the decks when he throws down.
__________________________________________________

Def_Leper ( Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids ) Dayton
What can I say? Sliced bread had a good, long run but now this is the best 
thing to hit the scene. If you miss this set you should be shot with many 
Fruit Pebbles until your bum is sore. The 80's pop and hardcore mixture 
will have you dancing on tables and screaming at the top of your lungs.

***WINTER WONDERLAND 2***

DDR - London, United Kingdom (LIVE PA) - www.damndjs.com - Techno/Acid 
Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well 
as Stay Up Forever, Cluster and Choci's Chewns.  Whether you like trance 
house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno 
- Chris Anderson is one of those rare jacks-of-all-trades who has his hand 
in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic 
culture and if you like hard, techy, funky and acidic beats - look no 
further!

DJ Rip - Chicago, Illinois - Substance USA - www.fusedmanagement.com / 
www.djrip.com - Hard Progressive/Hard House - You know him, you love him 
and after last year's performance, we just had to bring him back.

over the U.S. and Canada and on into Europe.  His production work includes 
works with Angel Alanis, Bam Bam, Alex Peace and more.  Rip is now taking 
his efforts to the next level moving his work into the progressive/tech

throughout the Midwest and Canada together and separately, they have left

bass lines, they will be performing a special hour and a half tag team
that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002 
WMC in Florida and had to bring her in to Ohio for her first appearance!

Mon Dec 23                         ARRIVAL                           Toledo

GlassCity Records Presents:
*Arrival*
Monday, December 23rd 2002
Toledo, Ohio
Robert Armani - Chicago - Techno - High Octane

When you put the words "Chicago" and "Techno" together one man comes to
mind, Robert Armani! The south side "Crown Royal Funksta" has been a
techno staple for the last decade and his discography puts him in a league
all his own. On his first trip to spin in Italy he realized his true
calling while studying to be a Chicago Police officer (we almost lost
him). Just the mention of "Blow It Out", "Burn Out", "Big Dick", "Playing
With a Rubber Band", "Ambulance", and, of course, "Circus Bells", brings
back memories of dancing to them over the past ten years at rave parties
and in clubs all around the world. Dance Mania, ACV, Dust Traxx,
Djax-Up-Beats, and High Octane are the labels where his music has been
released and his remixes of JB3 (Joey Beltram), Paul Johnson, Dave Clarke,
Blake Baxter, Armando, and even Gary Numan have elevated him to the
highest of heights. With sixteen full length album releases and over sixty
single releases it has been hard to avoid Mr. Armani's work while flippin'
through any techno bin. His relentless tour schedule has him on the road
non-stop and his hard hitting, dirty, Chicago Techno has rocked clubs
since his early days of spinning. This is a man of Techno royalty and we
are happy to live under his reign.

Translucent - Chicago - House/Techno - Transparent, DTX 

Translucent, also known as Jason Torres, has been playing and studying
music for over sixteen years. Having been influenced by jazz artists such
as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Charlie Parker, Jason started playing
the trumpet and piano at a young age. His dedication to music earned him a
full jazz scholarship to the prestigious Roosevelt University in Chicago
where, in 1994, he was influenced by another style of music known as House
Music. Jason then began DJing and started something new and fresh in the
dance community: playing live trumpet while spinning records, combining
the elements of live jazz with electronic music. Noticing that Jason had
something special, Paul Johnson, the creator of the gold record "Get, Get
Down," helped Jason create connections in Chicago. Since then, Translucent
has played live trumpet with such greats as Derrick Carter, Timo Maas,
Mark Farina, Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr., Glenn Underground,
Cajmere, Boo Williams, Carlos, and Halo. Recent recording projects include
Glenn Underground's new album on Guidance, work with Derrick Carter on
classic, and Gene Farris on Fluential.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: I'm not going to comment, just pass this along.

This is crazy stuff. That whole "write 8 tickets, get 8 hours" is sick to 
me. That pretty much pees in the face of "...to protect and serve"

Regarding the whole war thing. I didn't really read the details about the 
Yemen thing until last night and that is really, really, big, serious shit. 
Basically the U.S. killed 6 Al Qaeda operatives, including one of the 
biggest, in Yemen. They did it with full knowledge and cooperation of the 
Yemen regime. They attacked in secret and blew these guys up in a country 
that is suppposed to be in a state of peace. A sneak attack on them is 
totally an act of terrorism on our part, because it was a decision made 
simply on U.S. beliefs. It was supposed to follow international due process 
of law. Now the precedent has been set that we can kill anyone, anywhere at 
anytime by claiming they are part of a "terrorist" organization. What 
qualifies for that monicker? Following by example, everyone in the U.S. 
qualifies. The Yemen government urged any Al Qaeda supporters to come out 
now, or face a similar fate.

North Korea threatened Japan by claiming they might lift the moratorium on 
Uranium enrichment and may actually conduct a nuclear test (according to 
Post-Gazette.) U.S. declared there will be no negotiations until all major 
weapons testing and manufacturing has been eliminated. Korea countered by 
saying they were selling off some of their used reactor fuel. This is scary 
fucking shit.

Not going anywhere in particular with this post. Just worrying about the 
future a little. Lets all hope.

i never thought of the math...well the rave act just made a whole lot more 
sense to me now...it would make sense to pass legislation like that because 
it would legalise shit like that...i bet if you look at the records of any 
the bill authors' home districts you see something like what happened in 
detroit happening...except someone did take the ticket to court and 
won...this will just legalise police extortion(which is what this is all 
boiling down too)...it seems law enforcement is keen to make money anyway 
they can now...riddle me this...i live in parma ohio....anyone from the 
cleveland area knows how notorious the parma police(or the border patrol as 
i like to call them)is...in parma they will pull you over for just about 
anything they can...shake you down, run your id, and try to find more 
offences...in fact...the police have a deal going with the with their 
officers...take an extra traffic shift...write 8 tickets...and regardless of 
how long you were out you get paid 8 hours of overtime...

1984 was only 18 years off i think...scarey to think the repubilcans have 
total control of this country for 2 years too...thats right...the white 
house, both houses of congress, and the supreme court...there are about 20 
or so federal judges that are going to be appointed too now...they were 
being held up by a liberal senate...which all means...less liberties for 
us...more power/control for the federal gov't...and just to think the 
republican party was for more power for the states...and less control by the 
federal gov't...when the faction was termed during first few 
presidencys...how things change...i wouldnt be surprised if we goto war 
after thanksgiving...nothing like a war to get ppl out and shopping for 
xmas...what with all the advertising they'll be shoving down our throats on 
the news channels...i read somewhere that fox, nbc, and cnn sold speculative 
advertising to lots of corporations that would run only if we went to war...

sorry i got long winded...

<<This is crazy stuff. That whole "write 8 tickets, get 8 hours" is sick to

1) If you had a chance to get paid for 8 hours of work while only actually
doing ONE hour of work, wouldn't you?

2) On an average road, how many people would you guess break the speed limit
per hour?

Unfortunately I can't quote a specific resource, but I recently read a study
that showed that 75% of drivers regularly break speed limits on any given
road.

Now, on a road that gets even 100 cars per hour, that's 75 cars breaking the
speed limit in one hour.

Do the math.

Furthermore, have you driven lately?? I drive 10 miles...from downtown
Pittsburgh to my house in Greentree. I'd bet that on any given day, I see 20
traffic violations in that trip. (I'd venture to guess that number doubles
on my way home Friday afternoon...)...crossing lanes in the tunnels, running
red lights...even something as simple as not using turn signals ARE
ticketable offenses...

When it comes to traffic violations, it doesn't take Scherlock Holmes to
catch someone doing something stupid.

I'm not excusing abuses that obviously happen by less than reputable cops,
but I for one would like to see some areas get a little tougher on morons in
traffic.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: I'm not going to comment, just pass this along.

I am totally with you on what you're saying. My problem though is with 
getting 8 hours for writing 8 tickets. Why not get 8 hours for WORKING 8 
hours, and write whatever the requisite number of tickets is to suit the 
situation? Makes perfect sense to me.

I was never saying that they shouldn't write tickets. I'm the first to agree 
with you that Pgh is full of some of the shittiest drivers I have ever seen. 
I feel that I am conscientious and careful when talking on the phone when I 
drive, but some of the assholes in Pgh make me reconsider my position on 
making it illegal. Some of the fuckers around here need to get rammed off 
the road for not paying attention. Ticket the piss out of them, I could not 
care less about that.

doing ONE hour of work, wouldn't you?

CAR RAM ROD

anyways, i've taken my stance on driving and talking on the phone, i only
talk on the phone when i have my hands free setup with me... other than
that, i've been cut off so many times by dumb bitches in suv's that are
talking on their phones and not paying attention.  I love when i get to stop
at a light and yell out the window at them "Shut up and drive, assholes like
you should take the bus" :o)

Heh. I agree.

And considering that WE'RE footing the bill...yeah, that does kinda piss me
off.

But if you step back and think about it for a moment....if my company
(Stargate) gave me a free paid personal day for something stupid and
frivilous...should Stargate's customer's be upset about that?? I mean,
that's where their money is going...

Are the terms "taxpayers" and "consumers" synonymous? Do "taxpayers" have
the same "consumers rights" as "consumers"??

yes dave ... and I like romantic dinners by candle light and walks on the 
beach and horseback riding and ...

Someone pointed out to me that Osmotic might have played at Havana about 2 
years ago (I can't keep track)
If he did, that was the old 'trancy' Osmotic ... tonight will be the new 
improved deep and hard house Osmotic.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Tonight@Havana - iPhunk Preparty

i'm pretty sure this is the year that definately turned my interests from
shit that banged to shit that was fucking sweet to listen to.  Deep House
used to not do it for me, now, I cant seem to find enough places to hear it,
and i'm not about to drive to pittsburgh just to hear deep house... i think
jeff pons should get back into spinning again, or someone should hit me up
with info for the columbus area if they know of local events that are
featuring deep house, or at least have it represented in a lineup...

its not even just deep house man. its the deeper techno, the deep 
jungle stuff, just music thats more about a groove and some melody 
than it is about hard banging crap. deep dance music is just the 
best, no question.

There is an all Deep House night in Indianapolis called Keepin' it Deep, first Saturday of every month at Eden. Also I think there's gonna be a Monday night thing startin up in Dayton here pretty soon called Put On Ice, lots of deep house, more laid back kinda clubnight, don't know where its being held at yet, but I'm sure I can find out.  There's also Clique on Fridays in Covington(just across the river from Cincy) at Bar Humbug.  I dunno about Columbus, but that should give you a few options nearby...

damn

I was praising my love of deep house and other deep shit like 3 
years ago when people were all about hard/dark jungle and happy 
hardcore.  That was right around the time Tom was starting to get 
into that and 2step.


And thanks for saying goodbye last night celeste, blah.  I was all 
about trip-hop like 7 years ago.  3 years before i started going 
to parties.


btw, that guy tommy who did some reggae shit first at the bbt last 
nite, played in the second room at one of my parties like 2 and a 
half years ago.  If i had known that was him playing last night 
and even knew that the reggae was on first, i would have seen 
him.  But i suck and i missed it.

Hahaha.  Sorry.  I was tired and didn't feel like waiting for a ride or
for the bus, so I called a cab.  I didn't expect it to show up so
quickly, so like the bitch I am, I basically just cut and ran.  Besides,
I forgot to feed my cat, and she was pissy when I got home.

I've been about trip hop for 6 years now methinks?  Way before I started
really listening to dnb or jungle or a lot of other stuff.  Can't say I
ever liked happy hardcore. Trip hop will always be my shit.  Mellow,
chill, ambient stuff is the BEST stuff to listen to when going laying in
bed and just relaxing.

Deep house is always good.  So long as Goose knows that liking it
reinforces the fact that he's super-gay.  But that's only for him.

Subject: {pb-cle} Legowelt track on new Ritchie Hawtin/Sven Vath mix cd.

--0-1209337039-1036714702=:49890
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


  I have been going on sometime now about Legowelt a dutch electro/neo-disco producer.  This man is a great talent, one of the hardest working men in electronic music, one of the most skilled producers of electronic dance music, and a great freind.  This guy has so many projects coming out its very hard to keep up with.

  It now seems that some more reputable names in EDM are shareing my outlook.

 Legowelt's track Disco Rout has been licensed for European release to Sven Vath's Cocoon label and the 12" with mixes is due out next month (http://www.cocoon.net).  Vath and Richie Hawtin's new mix CD "Cocoon club" also features the tune (http://www.m-nus.com).

 

  I must admit its a bit shocking but Danny deserves every bit of recognition he gets and I can only say congratulations.  I must say though I am sorry to all those who missed his recent live performance when we had him out to Cleveland although you can expect us to have him out again this summer.  I also must say I am honored to be releaseing some Legowelt tracks to kick off the start of me new record label.

Here is a video of the Legowelt track Disco Rout.

-Check the video for Legowelt's Disco Rout (from Disco Nouveau) by genius Brazilian design firm, Lobo at http://www.lobo.cx.  Inspired by 1930's Swiss poster design in the style of Esther Williams, etc.  The Video is featured in this year's ResFest (www.resfest.com)


Also if anyone is interested my mix cd will be completed shortly (soon as these test pressing arrive hot off the presses from Holland).  The mix will feature tracks by Legowelt and other dwellers of the dirty dutch discotheques among others.  The CD will first be available at Bump3 where I will debut my new mix complimented by some very special visuals I am putting together.

Good for him.  I know for a fact shit tons of people scour the track lists

for me it started in the summer of 1998. derrick may played in
cleveland and it was awesome. then in 1999, i got into basic
channel, maurizio, and aril brikha. then in 2000 i got into more
detroit stuff and the house/2-step stuff. its snowballed from there. 

and really i always loved intelligent jungle, from 1996 on.

crackhead, before 1996 i didnt listen to jungle. i wasnt
specifying the year of the music, i was specifying the year that i
began listening to it. 

1994 stuff that was "intelligent" was my favorite.

Its definetly good to see that Ritchie is embraceing and supporting Legowelt who has been at it since the mid 90's while other DJs (like Keoki) are supporting all the NY "electroclash" trendies.  It may sound corny but after losing a bit of faith in Ritchie's integrity this raises my respect for him a few notches.  It for me anyhow separates those "superstar DJ's" who support whats good and those who support what they can cash in on.

Was it Logical Progression that started you, or was it before that??

Back in the day, i was all about Moonshine's Speed Limit 140+ BPM comps,
since that's all I really knew at the time.

Then I picked up a copy of Logical Progression...all the rules changed.

nah, actually by the time i first went to a rave, i had only heard 
ragga/jump up. then at my first rave, dieselboy spun, and he 
played mostly atmospheric shit, it sounded like i was actually in 
a jungle. then at the second rave i went to, sine played a set of 
intelligent. by then i was hooked, and shortly went out and got 
LP1. one of the first records i ever bought was "atlantis i need 
you" by ltj bukem. its still one of my all time favs. 

and yeah the 140 BPMs up until 6 or 7 were so fantastic. i dont 
have them all, but ive had them all on a dubbed tape or something. 
also, moonshine used to drop the dope jungle comps, like the Kings 
of the Jungle shit and sub base had the drum and bass selections 
out. i bought just about all of those commercially avaliable comps 
back then. unfortunately, alot of them bit the dust in this old 
red car i had that i kept CDs in.

Is there a hotline?
I don't have access to a flyer.

I wanna know if this is a Pgh. metro area party, or if it's happening out
somewhere. I want to stop out and see some music after work, but I don't
wanna travel 2 hours to stay for 30 minutes...

My dad had his surgery wednesday morning.  They were originally going to =
remove about half of his right lung, but they found some other =
suspicious spots, so they ended up removing the entire lung.  The =
surgery took about five hours all told, mostly because they were being =
careful in deciding to remove the whole lung.  So now we call him =
"Lefty".

Suprisingly, he's up and around, alert (thanks to some drugs), and was =
even able to walk around yesterday.  I went to visit him, and he's in =
good spirits, which hopefully will continue.  I'm not sure when he'll be =
able to come home, but I guess he won't be able to help me move in a =
couple weeks.  bastard.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} deep music

Yo -

Think some of you guys can hook me up with some info on early jungle 
producers/albums/etc.?

I would really like to get to know the early stuff before I beocme more 
familiar with the new music that is coming out now.

Haven't been on Soulseek in a while. The fact that my burner isn't working 
puts me off. Think I'm gonna hit that up late tonight. You get my messages, 
pipecock?

You want jungle or before jungle?

Or both?  (some of the same people)

Early jungle (94-on) = Shy FX, Goldie, M Beat, Marvelous Cain, Tom & Jerry, etc, etc....

Before jungle (Hardcore 87-93) = Bizzy B, Goldie, Bukem, Acen, DJ Phantasy, Krome & Time, 
Sonz of a loop de loop era, The Smart E's, Luna-C, Rebel MC, etc, etc....

does anyone still have a copy of volumes 1 and 2?

My collection begins at 3, and the first two are out of print for quite some

Tech support sucks...but it sucks less when you have a good soundtrack.

Some tight ass techno and such got me through this day.

So I just watched 8 Mile here while at work... not too bad, that movies =
gonna make alot of money tho cuz it's eminem... but i've taken alot of =
what clevr or zone (forget which one) said and started to listen to the =
shit that isnt played on the radio, and i have a decent amount of =
respect for him doing what he did, but then again, he's white, and he =
knows that is the only reason that he rose up above the rest in making =
the money.  But he's smart by putting out the poppy shit to make the =
loot, and the lyrical shit to keep the tru heads happy, so this is my =
thanks to clevr or zone for having me actually give him a second listen.

And another thanks to salty jen for having me take a listen to jurassic =
5 f/ nelly furtado - thin line... that song is dope as well.

>So I just watched 8 Mile here while at work... not too bad, that 
movies gonna make alot of money tho cuz it's eminem... but i've 
taken alot of what clevr or zone (forget which one) said and 
started to listen to the shit that isnt played on the radio, and i 
have a decent amount of respect for him doing what he did, but 
then again, he's white, and he knows that is the only reason that 
he rose up above the rest in making the money.  But he's smart by 
putting out the poppy shit to make the loot, and the lyrical shit 
to keep the tru heads happy, so this is my thanks to clevr or zone 
for having me actually give him a second listen.

So I just watched 8 Mile here while at work... not too bad, that movies
gonna make alot of money tho cuz it's eminem... but i've taken alot of what
clevr or zone (forget which one) said and started to listen to the shit that
isnt played on the radio, and i have a decent amount of respect for him
doing what he did, but then again, he's white, and he knows that is the only
reason that he rose up above the rest in making the money.  But he's smart
by putting out the poppy shit to make the loot, and the lyrical shit to keep
the tru heads happy, so this is my thanks to clevr or zone for having me
actually give him a second listen.

And another thanks to salty jen for having me take a listen to jurassic 5 f/
nelly furtado - thin line... that song is dope as well.

well here's a tip: dont bother with the new shit for the most 
part. there's enough old jungle to keep you occupied. jungle lost 
the plot sometime around 1998. there have been at least 25 
absolutely stupendous records since then, but compared to what was 
coming out before then, it doesnt even compare. if i were to make 
a jungle top 100, 90% of it would be from 94-96. and at least 5% 
would be earlier hardcore stuff. so basically, the last 4 years of 
jungle might amount to like 5% of the good jungle ever made. 

entropy gave some good hints, ill drop whatever's in my mind cause 
i dont have his list here:

artists pre 1998 - goldie, photek, dillinja, lemon d, peshay, alex 
reese, x-project, foul play, omni trio, johnny jungle/pascal, dj 
zinc, dj hype, ganja cru, krome + time, bizzy b, marvelous cain, 
remarc, ray keith, trace, PFM, a guy called gerald, doc scott, 
boymerang, ez rollers, shy fx, blame, adam f, johnny l, SS, 4 
hero, ed rush, aphrodite,  paradox, dj crystl, hidden agenda, 
digital. 

labels pre 1998 - metalheadz/razor's edge, good looking/looking 
good, whitehouse, suburban base, moving shadow, prototype, ganja, 
tru playaz, formation, SOUR, no u turn, reinforced, congo natty. 

i think we've already discussed the best albums on here, check the 
archives, it was recent. the allmusic.com guide to drum and bass 
is a good place to look. search for the labels and artists i 
mentioned, youll see some stuff come up. ask me if you need more 
info......

Subject: {pb-cle} Anti Rave Legislation Question

So with all the talk of the anti-rave legislation possibly coming around, I
was wondering....

The basic jist of the new legislation being discussed basically holds the
venue owner/promoter accountable for the actions of those in their care.....

With that in mind, does a prison warden have to do time if an inmate is
caught with drugs?

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Anti Rave Legislation Question

The Anti-Rave legislation your referring to (which, by the way, will
never pass since it can't muster up the backing that is needed) only
involves those who throw events and 'knowingly' throw that event as a
place where drugs are being consumed.

If a prison guard knows that drugs are being consumed and does nothing
about it, he has other issues about being a guard than just being caught
for the RAVE act.

Even if this did pass, the burden of proof is on the prosecution to
prove that you knew the drugs were being consumed.  That would be
difficult to prove in court, beyond a reasonable doubt, in front of a
jury.

Yeah, but is the issue that "hard?"

I mean, if you can create a strong enough correlation between EDM and
illegal drugs in the minds of jurors, does it make a difference? I believe
that this is unconstitutional, but I still worry that a strong prosecutor
would be able to get a conviction on an innocent promoter.

"Do you mean to tell the court that you threw an all-night techno rave
party, and did not realize there would be illegal drug use?"

I don't know how it works, though. You're the law scholar here, Lenny.

No.  "Breakcore" is a form of Gabber (which isn't Hardcore), that developed out of Gabber 
producers trying to make jungle-type tracks.

before 1994, Hardcore was just Hardcore, before is split up into "jungle/dnb", "happy 
hardcore", "nu skool breaks", "nu nrg", etc, etc, etc......there were a couple different 
styles, like Darkside and Belgian Techno, but for the most part, it was just Hardcore.

no. if you want breakcore, look to Doormouse, Abelcain, dj scud, 
Bombardier, Venetian Snares, etc. lables like Addict, Distort, Low 
Res, Praxis, etc.

i disagree. if anything, im thinking its just jungle made by non-
jungle people. it really has about nothing to do with gabber at 
all, reguardless of the fact that some of the people who make it 
or put it out once were associated with gabber. its got way more 
to do with noise and IDM than with gabber if youre going to 
compare it. plus, people like panacea definitely put out tracks 
that alot of people play with stuff by breakcore producers. 
panacea is definitely a jungle producer. even people like Keltech 
and Tech Itch on their nasty days make tracks that are breakcore 
or at least similar enough that they can be interchanged in a set.

I would love to see Kool Keith. Any info on pricing?

I've seen GWAR at least 4 or 5 times back in the day (90-93 or so) and I 
always got a big kick out of it. People talk shit on them, but its a show 
put on by art students cum musicians and isn't to be taken seriously. They 
were doing uber offensive shit and shocking people long before it became so 
trendy.

"After mugging talk show hosts in the bathroom, remember to always draw your 
swastikas turning to right. Never to the left, always to the right."

Subject: {pb-cle} ultramegasooperhappyfunravepartyreview

okay, so i haven't been to buffalo since lift 1 (1997?)  its just so cold
up there usually   =)

anyhow, this time the weather wasn't too bad.  damn warm for november?
we get there and wait in line under a marquee that says "nov 12 gwar" and
talk with the kids in line behind us about how cool it would be if gwar
played this party  =)

heh.  that'd rule.  anyone know if they're playing clevland?  someone said
columbus....

the venue.  some small converted theater, apparently a concert hall.
reminded me of the opera house in toronto.  a bit crowded.  thinned out
around 2.  stuffy most of the night.  blah.

music.  on point.  slammed all night.  well until 5:30 or so.  figured at
that point with the drive ahead it'd be a good point to leave.

we got there and someone (hoggs?) was playing jungle and forcing in a bit
of hip-hop.  jungle--good, hip-hop--bad.  some ragga-ish stuff.  nice
start to the night =)

sigma - goa-ish stuff, nu-nrg, trancecore stuff, acid trance.  good set, i
think kids were getting tired at this point though.

everyone in between (berzerker, simon apex, frisky, d-minus, jarefox, mc
jumper)...  non-stop hard trance, freeform, HHC.  the spectrum.  though mc
jumper did get on the mic a few times and wreck things.  yucko.

didn't hear too many of those played out HHC anthems thank god.

visuals.  from the start i thought it was jbrick but wasn't sure.  he's
gotten better.  not once did i see the credits of a movie winding out.  he
did still stay on one movie/clip/theme for far too long though.  an
improvement over his past VJ gigs i've seen.

sound.  a bit overpowering and distorted.   looked like the house setup.
not enough speakers for what was being driven into them powerwise.  alot
of distortion.  oddly it sounded fantastic with earplugs in.  *shrug*
trish complained of ringing in her ears even though she wore earplugs all
night!  i had a light ring in mine, not anything major.

lights.  looked like the house setup of some oversized par/can lights.  a
huge disco ball too   =)

all in all probably the best party funwise since goaheads kiss the sky.
best party musicwise since wemf 2002.

funny how i listened to this stuff all the time when it first came out and 
loved it.  Then for a long period of time it seemed like i was embaressed to 
listen to it cause it seemed so out dated.  Now its like 10 years later and 
i fucking love that shit, i guess i always did.  I absoutly love the 
production, what they did with the samplers of the time just fucking amazes 
me.

thanks a bunch

Subject: {pb-cle} LordsOfAcid&PraghaKhan

What a great show last friday. I've seen them a half dozen times now and i've never seen the same girl twice. This show had to be my 2nd favorite (the Sextacy Ball w/ My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult being 1st). Got a chance to hang with them for a little bit and were pretty nice for a bunch of Germans (FYI:nazi's aren't usually very cool). Pragha Khan, being the mastermind behind the Lords sound was excellent as well, playing VERY hard in true German (and Pragha) fashion. Too drunk to remember Groove afterwards but i heard it was a great time as well.

I would love to see Kool Keith. Any info on pricing?

I've seen GWAR at least 4 or 5 times back in the day (90-93 or so) and I

always got a big kick out of it. People talk shit on them, but its a
show 
put on by art students cum musicians and isn't to be taken seriously.
They 
were doing uber offensive shit and shocking people long before it became
so 
trendy.

it's 
funny that I'm considering going?

Mushroomhead kinda dominated that show.  GWAR is real funny. I laughed so

Subject: {pb-cle} listen, download and promote here....

Greetings again from audiomind and aba productions!
(this is just a one off...email)

This time around I have some info on aba productions and some new =
promotional opportunities coming around.

First check out a new mix and an old mix second:
They both cross and cover many genre's and some are original tracks.=20
from techno, to tech trance, to house to breaks.... (but no cheez)

confessions of an open mind
http://www.clubradio.net/music/smihurl.cfm?mixid=3D2131

fusion
http://www.skoolhouse.com/realaudio/fusion.ram=20

(mix download here for fusion, mp3:)
http://home.emira.com/~audiomind/audiomind-fusion.zip

[email for track listings and/or demo request for you promoters and such!]

Second I decided to go ahead and put up a few tracks and will continue to =
do so in the future, so check back often, here:  (I am keeping some of the =
tighter tracks for vinyl release and not download, but you can download =
all the tracks on this page and all tracks i add in the future.)

www.mp3.com/dj_audiomind=20

Third, in the future if anyone wants to be included on the list for future =
releases, downloads, promotions, etc you can subscribe here:
djaudiomind-subscribe@yahoogroups.com=20
You can subscribe to digest mode on the preferences page on yahoogroups if =
you want.
But i dont see that many messages would come through here and it should be =
fairly low traffic.

You will be able to upload original tracks on the yahoogroups page and/or =
samples or pics.
I will include some original samples on my yahoogroups page for those to =
download and use in their tracks if you wish also.  Please let me know if =
you use them, just by hitting me up with an email (please email me for aba =
email addy, so the abusive spammers dont take over the addy) or by posting =
to djaudiomind@yahoogroups.com .
I want to see how many people like the samples or not.

Fourth i have been doing a radio show for some time now and would like to =
let you all know about a pretty good promotional opportunity, if you =
choose to be a part.

Everyday Thursday from 7-9pm+ eastern us standard time (though the website =
is through the uk and the times will read Friday from 12-2 am) I do an =
online radio show at=20
www.dancetraxx.com .(the radio section under audiomind)
It is a well known and awesome radio station that pulls in about 30,000-50,=
000 hits a month.  You can promote your mixes on the site as well.

For a little while now, every other week i have been promoting those =
exceptional electronic mix cd's and original cd's (of any and all =
electronic genre's) on my show for everyone in the world to listen to, of =
artist who have sent me cd's for promotional opportunities.
I play two cd's from artists who have mailed me cd's, that i feel express =
extremely good talent, motivation and artistic expression.
I have gotten an extremely good response to this and I hope to continue it =
long into the future.

So if anyone feels they would like to contribute their artistic side =
(either with a mix cd or an original produced cd by an independent label =
or otherwise) feel free to send me a promotional copy to:

Chris Dooley
ABA Productions
720 High Meadow Lane
Suite U
Charlotte NC 28217 USA

I give all cd's a listen and comment and review those i play on the air.
Please include a complete track listening with your cd's for those that =
ask for track id's.
Please let me know by email or otherwise that you are sending me a cd or a =
promotional item and surely get back in touch with me after a week or so, =
so that i know you are truely interested in the promotion and so that you =
can remind me to give you a review of the cd if i havent done so already.
Cheers!

Five, for those in the past that have sent me cd's i applaud you.
I have recvd a ton of extremely good mix cd's and original tracks from you =
all.
Even those that never gave me an email back to ask me what i thought.
I apologize if i havent gotten in touch with some of you, as i have been =
extremely busy myself with promoting and traveling, etc.
Also in the past 6 months to 1 year, times have been mighty slow in the =
scene here.
But from my understanding it is a nationwide and even worldwide thing =
going on.
Turnouts have been mediocre at times and money has been dwindling and the =
ability to throw events.

BUT.....

Lately in the past 2 months, things have really begun to pick up and =
hopefully we can get some of you still out here to play, if you are still =
interested.
But please send me items, cd's, and tracks for review first, so that i can =
decide who to bring out and who to hold back on for the time being.
We here at aba review and go through everything, no matter how long it =
takes!

Please keep it real and include a bio and picture if you have that.
This along with any production credits/tracks, a well presented cd and =
other relevant info will receive greater attention and response than those =
done with less motivation.

Below is just a few things i thought might be of interest to some:

an email newsletter i receive weekly at=20
www.yellowtimes.org is very thought provoking and knowledgeable on world =
events from a different perspective.  Not for the faint at heart.

I also receive a weekly news letter from www.skrufff.com magazine.
Based out of the uk it is an extremely good electronic newsletter about =
the scene and members include many top djs and artist.
The read is a once a week email info letter.
Tell jonty i sent you.
It is a great newsletter.

ther sites for aba and audiomind (and sites where you can upload mixes, =
tracks, whatever)
www.audiomind.tk=20
www.clubradio.net=20
www.skoolhouse.com=20
www.globaldjs.com=20

Subject: {pb-cle} VELVET Tonight - d.c. space, Osmotic, Jwan Allen - FREE

Well I left my fancy template at home, for I am visiting the lush paradise
of New Jersey.  But here is the jist:

DC Space - 12:30-2
Osmotic - 11-12:30
Jwan Allen - 10-11

If you don't know what DC space plays, and you live in Pittsburgh, shame
on you.  He will rock it with some deep and vocal house.  Osmotic, well,
the "new" Jason :) will be there playing some deep house and progressive
grooves.  And Jwan Allen, don't sleep on him.  He will be playing the
finest Detroit techno, broken beat, and deep house you can buy (and even
some things you can't buy).

$1 Yuenglings and Iron Cities from 10-12.  With only 3 Velvet nights left
including this one, it astounds me that some people I know have never even
been out once!  :) Well, you are missing out on one of the dopest beer
specials in this city, soon to be no more...

Memphis Lounge @ Zythos on the Southside.  Exact address, check the website.
All the info you need is at: http://ratana.chemlab.org/velvet

holly hiss batman...  i really can't believe that dara tape was 93, damn 
thats good breaks.  question for you, mr Entropy, or who ever.  i'm just 
wondering what you would list as top most frequent break samples used in 
those tracks of that era, besides the amen of course.

i'm guessing assembly, funkdrummer, apache, yet i know theres got to be some 
others, and i'm sure you probably know.  lol, i'd ask this on the production 
list yet your banned.  i know its more the style yet i often wonder on some 
of the breaks cause they fucked'm up so good.  help a brotha out

I encode them directly from tape and just normalize em.  That way if others wanna clean em 
up, they can, cause everyone does it their own way.

I personally, prefer the "hiss".

thanks for breakin off a piece of knowledge!  the last 2 are the ones i 
think i was asking about, i have them too, i just have so many others as 
well its hard to sift and figure out whitch ones those oldschoolers used 
sometimes.  Just to set you at ease, i personally just call the sampled drum 
riff portion of any style track the break portion.  if i'm talking many 
portions i use plural as in that case.  To further set you at ease, in my 
mind, compared to any of the other music of that time frame, that shits 
HARDCORE by deffinition.  I SO miss machinegun drums and the pitching of the 
drums <- not sure what thats called, where they go up or down in pitch as 
machine gun stuttering.  That and the creative use or raw vocal and chord 
hit samples.  i could go on

>Lyn 1, 2, and 3 ("think")

the lyn collins "think" break is just about never used in jungle 
stuff. you can hear it in rob base and dj ez rock "it takes two" 
and has that annoying ass "ooh, yeah" thing in it. 

>Apache

yeah i still dont have that break. its pissing me off. 

>Assembly 1 and 2

dont know what this might be ace. 

>Let a Woman Be A Woman

or this.

>Worm

im assuming this is the "funky worm" by the ohio players, i dont 
think thats used in jungle. its got synth things all over it. 

check:

the honey drippers "impeach the president" (OPP by naughty by 
nature if i remember correctly)

skull snaps "a good day"

there's a couple sly stone breaks you can grab from his greatest 
hits CD i cant think of the titles but its easy as hell to find

thats all off the top of my head for now. but go crate digging, 
thats how to find the hot shit. ive got no less than 20 breaks 
that to the best of my knowledge havent been sampled in a 
distictive popular tune. and no, you cant get them or know what 
they are : P 

you can find the fattest fucking breaks on the oddest records 
sometimes........

tom

ive never heard of anything else sampled with the word "worm" in 
it, but who knows. maybe there's some weird extended 12" version 
with an empty break on it.

I prefer sampling em from mp3 myself.

I like the overcompressed sound, make it really raw, thick, and kinda lo-fi.

The stuff from vinyl is usually too bright for me, I have to make it a little more "lo-fi" 
to use it, or I run the risk of sounding like those Nu Skool DNB twats.

will do  :)

mp3s in and of themselves don't "compress", as in a compressor.  they
distort the sound a little when the "compression" algorithym drops stuff,
or when it glitches.  IMO thats a bad thing.  mp3s are good for moving
data around, but it is a lossy format, and not a terribly good one.
though it is generally better than real at lower bitrates.

work the sample over. massage it. theres a million ways to do that.

ranges from the low fi playing it thru a system and eq'ing it to taste and
putting a mic in the room somewhere and recording it up to running them
thru other efx.

There used to be a CD compilation called Hip-Hop's greatest breaks, or =
some shit like that.  had 70 32-beat breaks, many rather recognizable =
(stetasonic, too $short, naughty by nature, soul II soul).  I think four =
versions were put out, one like the one I mentioned, and I had another, =
vol 4, that had g-funk beats, but they were full on 4-minute breaks (Da =
Brat's "Funkdafied" is the only one I remember off-hand).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mark! speed limit

Ian,

Try recording with the input cranked up a bit.

I'm not arguing with your method, it's better than getting that garbled,
noise-reduced sound, but more audio, less noise would be great.

I do transfers from tape AND vinyl at my house, so if anyone has any they
want done, come on over! Bring em, we'll drink wine and listen to some good
shit!

I encode them directly from tape and just normalize em.  That way if others
wanna clean em
up, they can, cause everyone does it their own way.

I personally, prefer the "hiss".

Subject: {pb-cle} techno at jerrys

Over the weekend, records that were stolen from me 2 years ago, 
finally showed up at Jerry's. 

That batch of records was quickly sold to 2 people. 

I already know of one person who purchased some records from this 
batch. So if you anyone out there thinks they know someone who 
recently purchased some techno/house records at jerry's, please 
have them contact me immediately! 

They can either email me at this address or call me at 412-512-
0593. I can verify the track titles, as well as the sleeves the 
records came in. these records are very rare and i haven't been 
able to replace them. So any help would be greatly appreciated.

thank you

Jwan Allen


ps Kelly/andy/trout can you forward this message to the ppl list? 
i forgot the address. thanks

There is no one I have less respect for than a DJ who steals records.  I =
know Quantum has a couple records of mine, some I don't want back =
(fucking Barbie Doll for god's sake!), but others (Nuyorican Soul =
"Runaway" and Too Kool Chris "Roof Is On Fire") I would very much like =
to get back.  Fucker.

Senator Mix-A-Lot Sponsors Titties-On-Glass Legislation:

WASHINGTON, DC Seeking to stem a four-year decline in freaky
Yolandas throwing they titties on U.S. glass, U.S. Sen. Mix-A-Lot
(B-WA) introduced sweeping new putting-'em-on-glass legislation
Tuesday. "Now listen up, Uncle Sam / I wanna see soul sistas pressin'
that ham / Make me say damn / I wanna rear-end 'em / So I'm callin' a
Senate referendum / Bounce by the ounce don't make no fun / I'll take
'em by the ton, son," Mix-A-Lot said. "Don't hand this bill down to
no committees / 'Cause Mix don't wait on monster titties / Note to my
colleague Tom Daschle / That if the babies be gettin' bashful / No
melons droppin' on my windshield / So get them nudie laws repealed." 

Mix-A-Lot then gave props to the authors of H.R. 1610, from which
several key clauses were sampled.

For all those interested, the USA Today has an above the fold article on raves and the Crackhouse law situation in New Orleans.  It's the Nov 13 (today) issue, I'm sure there is a hyperlink for it but I figure you can find it if you don't want to spend the 50 cents.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} fuckin sweet techno...

reissue of a record orginally released in '94 ( i knew it was old, 
but i got the exact year from the sonic groove database (its a 
great resource) hopfeully this will be a return to form for the 
highly respected plink plonk imprint. I don't think need to 
release more records exactly like this one, but it couldn't hurt. 
The last few releases on this label have been a bit dodgy by my 
standards. so mark if you haven't already done so buy it. 

my other techno pick for the week:

technasia : recreations (claude young rmx) this record has anthem 
written all over it.

oh and by the way, if you have a fast enough connection, you can just stream
that from the server by putting the url into winamp or media player... it's
128k encoded mp3... so cable/dsl will easily be able to stream it if you
dont feel like waiting on the download...

cheers!

Like I said, I prefer the thinning of the sound from mp3.  

Thinner sounds = more sounds that can fit = less minimal music = a good raving experience

Subject: {pb-cle} BiggestClubNightoftheYear

The night before Thanksgiving is considered by most in the clubbing industry to be the busiest night of the year. It's time to start thinking about where YOU will be. If you are smart (like me:SMARTIE) you will be at Metropol where you will be bombarded by quality, well trained, aggressive deejays who will relentlessly slather your ass with A-1 chop sauce and grill you for a midnight snack. And for desert, visit the chill-out/vip room for some sweet, double-fudge, chocolate chip, whipped cream, better than porno (wait i take that back nothing's better than porno), razz-a-matazz, super-chunk FUNK love.

It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs
So won't you move your butt

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Dusty??

I just got done checking out this week's new releases on Global Beats
and there was a record called "Hardtime" on Numeric records by Dustin.  Does 
anyone know if this is Dustin of Pittsburgh house fame?  I couldn't listen 
to the track because I am at work and don't have speakers at my office 
computer, but the description of the track says "a new artist from NYC" and  
"cool tribal house."  Sounds like Dusty to me, but does anyone know this for 
sure?  He was (and still is, even though he's in NYC) my all-time favorite 
Pittsburgh house DJ, and a pretty nice guy to boot.

Peace,
Darren

I'm stuck here at the office until 1:00 AM tonight and won't get a chance to

so i was driving down the road today about 75 or 80... when about 10 =
feet in front of me a deer decided that the side of the road and =
proceded to the other side... Hmmm... Makes a question come up... "Why =
did the deer cross the road?" well my answer is that he didnt really =
cause i took out the whole back half of his body with the front right =
side of my car... I laughed about it and started going again because =
home was close enough that i could see the damage when i got home... =
Well he definetly fucked up my car the hood is bent and the grill is =
smashed and my front right headlight was fucked but as of now thats all =
i could see cause its dark out... just thought this was kinda =
interesting... so umm... when ya see a deer on the side of the road... =
slow the fuck down cause they for some reason tend to think the other =
side of the road is the best place to run too when your coming their =
way...

Peace,

just picked up this double mix CD tonight, and its really fucking 
good. youd better be a fan of techno, cause theres just silly 
amounts of music. the mixing is simple and transparent, just how i 
like it. he flows between a ton of really great tracks in many 
different moods. ill be taping each disc and rocking them in my 
car for sure.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Fri Nov 15                   MORR MUSIC ON TOUR                    Columbus

Morr Music on Tour

Featuring Lali Puna, Opiate, and Styrofoam

Fri, Nov 15 / 9 pm
Black Box show on Mershon Stage
$10 OSU students and Wex members
$12 general public

Berlin-based electronica label Morr Music brings three artists
-- Lali Puna, Opiate, and Styrofoam -- to the Wexner Center on
November 15. Thomas Knak, a.k.a. Opiate, is one of the most
acclaimed electronic artists and DJs to emerge from Denmark.
He's known both for his contributions to Bjork's Vespertine and
the innovative ambient, electronica, and drum and bass sounds he
spins internationally. Belgium's Arne van Petegem, the man
behind Styrofoam, summons shimmering down-tempo melodies that
construct warmly enveloping fields of cinematic sound. Munich's
Lali Puna, a.k.a. Valerie Trebeljahr, has charmed fans of Aphex
Twin and Stereolab with her four-piece band¹s sophisticated
atmospheric avant-pop, which layers keyboards, samplers, and
laptops with hypnotic lyrics sung in English and Portuguese.

For more information on Morr Music visit www.morrmusic.com.

CALL THE WEX @ 292-3535 or Ticketmaster at 431-3600 for tickets.

Thu Nov 21            SYMBIOSIS: Live Art/Music Auction     Antioch College

"Symbiosis: Live Art/Music Auction"
Thursday, November 21st - 6pm until 2am
Birch Space @ Antioch College - 450 Corry St, Yellow Springs, Oh 45387

Symbiosis, defined in biological terms, is a mutually beneficial
relationship that exists between two or more organisms living in close
proximity or contact. You are cordially invited to witness as both
students and faculty from Antioch College create their own manifestations
of symbiosis in artistic terms - a stunning interaction between art and
music. The art and music are performances themselves, the spontaneous
creation of various mediums of art simultaneous to both live and DJ
musical performances encompassing a broad range of music.

At the end of each performance, an auction will be held that provides the
rare opportunity for the audience to acquire both the original art and
recordings of the music that was just experienced. All proceeds will
directly benefit the Performing Arts Committee at Antioch College.

Of Art:
Professor Chris Garcia (ceramics & sculpture)
Ally Adduci (oils)
Sara Duda (acrylics)
Erin Ford (ceramics)
Bryan Heidel (4-D mixed media)
Daniel Marks (sculpture)
Kyle McCann (ceramics)
the Antioch Media Collective (film and video)

Of Music:
the Beast (bluegrass)
Dr. Falafel w/ Method Moyle (breaks/hiphop dj w/ mc)
erth (live psychedelic trance)
Mo Mizuho (violin & voice)
Prodjeckd Grande Omega Minus (glitch/idm)
the Quartet (post-rock)
Reverberber (glitch/idm)
Will Robinson (live groovy breakbeats)

This event is open to the entire community. Entrance is free of charge.
Please be aware that access to the Antioch campus is restricted to the
Birch Space. Wandering, loitering, and any form of disrespect will not be
tolerated. Positive interactions and bidding on the auctions will be
encouraged.

Please contact daniel at 937.769.1027 during business hours for additional
information or email at dmarks@antioch-college.edu. MapQuest supplies
comprehensive directions. The Birch Space is located 1/4 mile south of the
intersection of 68/Xenia and Corry St on the right. The Birch Space is the
ground floor section below the dormitories.

Bio:
Steve Lawler is a definitive DJ and producer: a tastemaker whose sets 
combine quality house music with the power to move dance floors around the 
world. In the last few years, he's ignited crowds in the worlds best clubs 
such as Zouk in Singapore, Space in Miami, Twilo in New York, Pacha in 
Buenas aires and the mighty Space in Ibiza. Courtesy of home in the summer 
of 1999 and 2000, he provided the groundbreaking sets of the season for 
many of those lucky enough to hear him. Just after the first two months he 
had been crowned 'King Of Space' by the locals - a rare and well deserved 
honor. For over a year, Lawler set the capital alight with his weekly 
Friday night residency at Deepsouth at home. I f you were lucky enough to 
catch one of his 6 hour sets, you'll know exactly what it felt like as he 
weaved his magic across the club's sound system, wowing clubbers and 
critics alike. In Febuary2001, Steve decided to finish his stint at home 
due to overwhelming demand for his skills across the UK, and farther a 
field to the USA and the rest of Europe.

Sat Nov 30                    ROCK THE BELLS 2                       Dayton

Wishing Well and Groovefuel Recordings, on Saturday November 30th, bring 
you.......

"Rock the Bells 2, The Second Ringing" featuring the following djs and/or 
acts........


Donald_Glaude ( Moonshine Records, Eden Records ) Los Angeles, California
A veteran DJ for over 15 years, Donald Glaude has cemented his reputation 
as a crowd-rocking favorite and one of the most in demand artists in the 
country. He is one of those rare DJs who perceives their role to be that 
of an all-around entertainer and performer. He exudes energy, dropping 
track after funky track, arms aloft, and has been known to join the 
dancers on the floor. Join us at Rock the Bells 2 to witness the man DJ 
Dan considers "one of the most entertaining DJs in America to watch live." 
__________________________________________________

Huge Surprise Orlando Breaks dj to be announced seconds before he takes 
stage. This guy has accomplished many things in the breaks world and 
people all over are playing his records. His blend of progressive and 
funky breaks will leave you in awe and wanting more, he flat out rocks the 
decks, and has done it in Dayton before.
__________________________________________________

UF0_! ( Phunkatech Records, Phylum Recordings, Circa ) New York City
Featured in magazines such as URB, XLR8R, Lotus, Mixmag, Knowledge, and 
many other 'zines, UFO! is one of the most sought after producers in the 
United States. Record labels across the country clamor for a UFO! remix, 
which guarantees a dance floor hit. A Bay Area native, UFO! pioneered the 
San Francisco Drum and Bass scene and co-founded the much respected 
Phunckateck collective, creating a new community in music. Now residing in 
New York City he is rocking more crowds then ever.
__________________________________________________

Charly ( Bassdrive, Well Known Djs ) Philadelphia
Spinning around the East Coast over the past few years has gained Charly 
the reputation for clean sets, crazy mixes, and an incredible vibe behind 
the decks. Headlining around the country with UFO!, Juan Atkins, DJ Seen, 
and AK1200, has earned, as well as provided, Charly immense respect. Once 
Charly is seen in action, it's easily understood why she has been touted 
to be the next best thing for the US Drum-n-Bass Scene. At the young age 
of only 18 she is sure to be the next superstar in drum and bass.
__________________________________________________

Trevor_Lamont ( NateFx, Soulbrothaz, Aliensquad ) Lexington KY
Trevor is one of the most respected and skilled DJs in the Midwest and is 
never to be missed as you might miss something spectacular. His experience 
reflects on his sets as he can always work the crowd with his soulful 
house music and break it down to its roots.vs.Samm-e ( Soulbrothaz, U.S. 
Hispanix, House Purists, Dr. Sun Prod, Senor MTSU ) Murfreesboro
Samm-e is one third of the nationally acclaimed Teamsters crew consisting 
of him, Halo, and Trevor Lamont. When he hits the decks there is a vibe 
that comes over the room and with him on two while T is on two, things 
could get crazy, and memorable.
__________________________________________________

Guy_Smilee ( www.gagproductions.com, www.neutralmusic.net ) Rochester, New 
York
Guy Smilee is one of the most popular happy hardcore djs in the US and 
with Jumper by his side they always bring the house down. Guy can scratch 
with about any part of his body, and make sure you watch on November 30th 
as you can see him in action. Like I said Jumper will be by his side and 
you all know he can rock it and let's show him how much we love him in 
Ohio. w/ Mc_Jumper ( GAG, Ruffneck Playaz Crew, www.neutralmusic.net ) 
Rochester, New York
__________________________________________________

Big Regional Surprise Act to close out the main room and rock it for an 
hour. These guys have been ripping it for a year now and have been ripping 
it all together for about 2 years. They made their debut last year on 
December 15th and will be closing out the main room at 5 with a set to be 
remembered for a lifetime.
__________________________________________________

Kid Chaos ( In the Groove, Infinity Prod )
This house music enthusiast is always a hit on the dancefloor. His fusion 
of disco house and groovy tech-house has helped him gain recognition 
throughout the midwest and get him on lineups with names such as Too 
Short, Sandra Collins, and more.
__________________________________________________

HE10 ( In The Groove ) Tucson, Arizona
Coming to us all the way from Tucson he is ready to throw down the dopest 
uplifting trance we have seen in a long time. The awesome track selection 
and flawless mixing will bring him back to our city more often, hopefully.
__________________________________________________

Mike_Donovan ( Bounce Theory, Scarab Records ) Dayton, Ohio
Mike is co-founder of the Bounce Theory in Dayton Ohio. Deep tech-house 
music for the sophisticated listener featuring smooth, deep, jazzy 
grooves. He will be promoting his new cd Paint the Town Redd so be close 
to the decks and you might get a copy.
__________________________________________________

Chromix_live pa ( Groovefuel Recordings, Do:Loop Records ) Cleveland
This Northern Ohio progressive and hard trance producing phenomenon has 
been writing tracks since the age of 15. His unique and powerful live set 
will leave you begging for more and make sure you watch out for his first 
release on Groovefuel Recordings later this year.
__________________________________________________

Matthew_Kelly ( 4-Score Productions, Katatonic Resident ) Nashville
This crazy scratching breaks master representing Nashville will make his 
first Wishing Well appearance and a long awaited one at that. Make sure to 
catch his set as his whole crew including Michelle make it up from 
Nashvegas.
__________________________________________________

Clay-Born ( Wishing Well, Breakline Crew ) Louisville
Clay is always bringing a new crate of records and a totally awesome 
performance to every event which keeps his sets fresh and new and the vibe 
totally flowing to the deep basslines and dirty beats that make up 
nu-skool breaks.
__________________________________________________

Foursqare ( Wishing Well, Metronomix ) Louisville
Last year around this time a dj was born to the scene to show everyone how 
to rock it, Foursqare style. The dope ass house sets she drops are enough 
to make people like Paul Johnson and other house legends say WHOA!!! 
__________________________________________________

e21 ( :SCENE:, Stellar Gruve ) Atlanta
The man behind SCENE Ohio made his first Wishing Well debut at the last 
Rock the Bells and rocking it this year will be no different. The trance 
selections he brings to the table are amazing and his attitude towards the 
music and his presence on stage show it all.
__________________________________________________

Nero_X ( Hypnotik Therapy ) Cincinnati
You thought you wouldn't hear the techno but what party is a party without 
techno. Get there early to hear this man bring it hard. Dino is an up and 
coming superstar in the Ohio scene so look out for him whenever you can.
__________________________________________________

Jigglypuff ( Independent ) Cincinnati
If you thought Guy Smilee was enough happy hardcore for the night you were 
totally mistaken because this guy will bring it in early to set the vibe 
and the night off on the right foot. Let the man we call Chester know how 
much we love him and be right next to the decks when he throws down.

What can I say? Sliced bread had a good, long run but now this is the best 
thing to hit the scene. If you miss this set you should be shot with many 
Fruit Pebbles until your bum is sore. The 80's pop and hardcore mixture 
will have you dancing on tables and screaming at the top of your lungs.

come all to one of the biggest toy for charity drives in Ohio.  Last year,
nearly 1400 people were in attenDANCE and with your help, we donated over
800 toys to charity in Dayton, Cincinnati, and Detroit.  This year we
expect to raise the bar even further with 6 headlining acts, Santa Claus
once again on the 1's and 2's spinning a sick-ass jungle set, NEW
HEADLINING TALENT, techno, trance, jungle, breaks, house, the chance to
get your picture taken with Santa, decorations, laser by Introspective,

more!

***WINTER WONDERLAND 2***

DDR - London, United Kingdom (LIVE PA) - www.damndjs.com - Techno/Acid 
Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well 
as Stay Up Forever, Cluster and Choci's Chewns.  Whether you like trance 
house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno 
- Chris Anderson is one of those rare jacks-of-all-trades who has his hand 
in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic 
culture and if you like hard, techy, funky and acidic beats - look no 
further!

DJ Rip - Chicago, Illinois - Substance USA - www.fusedmanagement.com / 
www.djrip.com - Hard Progressive/Hard House - You know him, you love him 
and after last year's performance, we just had to bring him back. 
 Acclaimed DJ and respected Producer, Rip has brought the roof down all 
over the U.S. and Canada and on into Europe.  His production work includes 
works with Angel Alanis, Bam Bam, Alex Peace and more.  Rip is now taking 
his efforts to the next level moving his work into the progressive/tech 
area and he has been host of several Chicago area radio shows over time. 
 Without question he is a driving force bringing our Midwest culture to
the next level!

Vibe Raider & Urbane - Madison, Wisconsin - www.wellknowndjs.com - Drum &
Bass - These two MW females need no introduction!  Having rocked
throughout the Midwest and Canada together and separately, they have left
many a dancefloor in devastation.  With hard driving drum codes and wicked
bass lines, they will be performing a special hour and a half tag team
that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002 
WMC in Florida and had to bring her in to Ohio for her first appearance! 
 You won't want to miss this set!

Phuzze - Madison, Wisconsin - Trounce Records / www.poopiehead.net - Tech 
Trance - A fast rising star from the upper Midwest scene, Phuzze dropped a 
super-dope set at Bumpin & Jumpin 2 and we expect nothing but another 
hair-raising, hands in the air slam fest.  Playing out on both coasts and 
in Europe, you expect a refined set of some of the best uplifting tracks 
out there.

Mon Dec 23                         ARRIVAL                           Toledo

GlassCity Records Presents:
*Arrival*
Monday, December 23rd 2002
Toledo, Ohio
Robert Armani - Chicago - Techno - High Octane

When you put the words "Chicago" and "Techno" together one man comes to
mind, Robert Armani! The south side "Crown Royal Funksta" has been a
techno staple for the last decade and his discography puts him in a league
all his own. On his first trip to spin in Italy he realized his true
calling while studying to be a Chicago Police officer (we almost lost
him). Just the mention of "Blow It Out", "Burn Out", "Big Dick", "Playing
With a Rubber Band", "Ambulance", and, of course, "Circus Bells", brings
back memories of dancing to them over the past ten years at rave parties
and in clubs all around the world. Dance Mania, ACV, Dust Traxx,
Djax-Up-Beats, and High Octane are the labels where his music has been
released and his remixes of JB3 (Joey Beltram), Paul Johnson, Dave Clarke,
Blake Baxter, Armando, and even Gary Numan have elevated him to the
highest of heights. With sixteen full length album releases and over sixty
single releases it has been hard to avoid Mr. Armani's work while flippin'
through any techno bin. His relentless tour schedule has him on the road
non-stop and his hard hitting, dirty, Chicago Techno has rocked clubs
since his early days of spinning. This is a man of Techno royalty and we
are happy to live under his reign.

Translucent - Chicago - House/Techno - Transparent, DTX 

Translucent, also known as Jason Torres, has been playing and studying
music for over sixteen years. Having been influenced by jazz artists such
as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Charlie Parker, Jason started playing
the trumpet and piano at a young age. His dedication to music earned him a
full jazz scholarship to the prestigious Roosevelt University in Chicago
where, in 1994, he was influenced by another style of music known as House
Music. Jason then began DJing and started something new and fresh in the
dance community: playing live trumpet while spinning records, combining
the elements of live jazz with electronic music. Noticing that Jason had
something special, Paul Johnson, the creator of the gold record "Get, Get
Down," helped Jason create connections in Chicago. Since then, Translucent
has played live trumpet with such greats as Derrick Carter, Timo Maas,
Mark Farina, Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr., Glenn Underground,
Cajmere, Boo Williams, Carlos, and Halo. Recent recording projects include
Glenn Underground's new album on Guidance, work with Derrick Carter on
classic, and Gene Farris on Fluential.

http://www.usatoday.com/life/2002-11-12-raves-1acover_x.htm


please tell usa today what you think:

editor@usatoday.com

fax 703-854-2053

personally i think the reporter gives us the opportunity to get our points
across in a larger, national forum.

by the way, i ran into her at the dc rally against the rave act and she
seemed like a nice person.  she said she'd been to buzz, and i could be
wrong, but i got the impression that she'd gone to party.  she's a national
reporter for usa today, and i think she did a good job of talking to a
representative spectrum of people who have something to say about this
issue and was fair to all parties.  though she reported stuff we don't like
to hear, i didn't hear a bias in her reporting against us.  she was
presenting the facts as were presented to her, including letting the scene
speak for its self and having the aclu speak on our behalf.

i hope you will consider sending usa today a publishable reaction that
steps up in our defense intelligently, relevantly and concisely.  thank you
very much, if you do.

respect,
mary :)

http://www.dredwinrodgers.com/mp3/tributetocarlcox.mp3

since i was a slackass and didnt go to work today, i decided to make a =
mix using a bunch of carl cox remixes and original tracks... there are 2 =
definate screwups (one at the 26 minute mark, and one toward the end), =
but overall it gives people an hour of music to listen to...

you can stream it directly by putting the url in winamp or media =
player... other than that, it was my first attempt actually spinning =
techno, and it was fun.  enjoy, and dont flame mail me too bad about the =
2 screwups...

Subject: {pb-cle} James Christian stuff

Since everyone else is in a sharing mood, this is a tape I got way 
back in 2001 :D  The date I copied it was in December 2001.  It's a 
tape I got when going to some party at Metropolis.

Title: James Christian - Paradigm Shift
Genre: Disco House / House
Bitrate encoded: 192kbs
URL: http://svr2.vrillusions.com/pb-cle/
It's on a road runner cable connection, so not the best upload speeds 
(I think they have it capped at 40kb/s)

I probably should downsample it.  even though it's at 192kbps, it 
still has the 'too compressed' sound to it.  Maybe 'cause I was using 
some cheap tape player when recording it.  Ohh well, not much noise, 
though.  Although on side a you get the 'buzz' from me turning on the 
tape player. (also, the intro does actually play on just the right 
side, that's how it was on the tape)

I also tried and did some recording off of radio1 have the angelli 
and nelson stuff from April 28, 2001.  And the Annie Nightingale show 
had a mix from Timo Mass from chicago.  Those are recorded at 
128kb/sec so you may be able to stream those with winamp.

i remember when this came out on first run promo
wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy earlier this year, or even late last year i
cant remember now. i heard it on the net, and i was totally
unimpresseed. i didnt order it, or even think about it. then like
3 weeks ago i heard ed umm play it on a decent system, and its
totally fucking rocking. i cant belive how bad it sounded over the
net. argh. i havent bought a "2-step" tune in over 6 months. the
broken beat stuff has been more satisfying recently. i need to
pick up a couple garage tunes that i missed over the summer
though. there were like maybe 2 that i want.

Upon viewing tha most recent ROM I've decided that Cleveland has a way better 
show of talent for tha next 6 months at least... not to mention around 
Pittsburgh its damn near dead... but anyhow, hopefully things will get good 
around here again for us Picksburghers I dunno... I think Matrix would be a 
nice venue to experiment with, given tha multiple rooms and sound systems, 
but I dont have a clue if theyd actually permit that to happen at that 
place... somethin needs to happen tho... *sigh*

peace.

No this isn't Rave Related....and no, it's not even
electronic music.  But you all should go listen to John
Denver's "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" right now.  Why?
Cause it's fun and puts a smile on my face.  Plus I
won't feel like SUCH a dork for having it play on
repeat at work right now.  That is all.  Thank you.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} LISTEN TO IT

the jam for me right now is "we're walking in the air" from some 
snowman thing. ive heard it a million times, i just dont know 
where. but its the track x-projekt sampled in the old hardcore 
tune "snowman" that ive been rocking on mp3 the last couple days. 
it might be one of the 3 best melodies ever written. .

at the time that came out, i was really excited. i thought they 
might try to pursue some more warm melodic type stuff, but they 
didnt. instead they put out "the creeps" or whatever that piece of 
junk was. 

hey, ive still got a bunch of older jungle stuff from 98-00 for 
sale, $5 a 12" if anyone wants any. id prefer to sell it in lots 
of 10 records or more if im going to have to mail it, mailing a 
bunch of little packages is annoying. so anyone who's interested 
can email me with their requests from that time period, and im 
going to draw up a list of everything ive got left (prolly about 
100+ records) sometime this weekend maybe.

I remember reading a post about how ed rush + optical opened one of their
sets w/ watermelon on plate, and everyone went insane.  Truly, honestly,
that is one of the most solid 12"s on virus because both sides are killer.
I remember a doc scott set when he opened w/ sick note.   I wish I could
have been at the show where they opened w/ watermelon. I can only imagine
what hearing that tune for the first time on a huge system would have been
like, instead of just in the shop, on headphones.

As far as the creeps goes.. it seems like you are one of a few outspoken
people who likes to talk mad shit on that LP.  True it is not the
technological or sonic masterpiece that wormhole was, but I LOVE the
creeps, and every tune on it is solid. There is a ton of funk to all of
the tracks on there, and every single one of them, I couldnt wait to come
out, when I used to hear the kiss fm shows with andy c and the ed rush +
optical show playing all that.  I think for the horrible year that 2000
was in terms of DNB, the creeps (came out in december I think?) made it
not so bad.  I would have loved to hear a "Wormhole part 2" from them but
I was equally pleased by the creeps, since to me, those tunes were a large
part of the small collection of new, exciting tunes that I wanted to come

What the fuck are you talking about? I think you should move to Cleveland in that case. You can go out ANY night of the week in Pittsburgh and hear QUALITY music from QUALITY disc jockeys unlike Cleveland where you basically have to wait for a party/weekends to hear (in my opinion) some mediocre "record players" and HOPE TO GOD the party doesn't get shut down or raided. Honestly, there is not ONE dj in Ohio that I'm sweating or really wanting to hear, as opposed to Pittsburgh where there are some cats who I love to hear play and make it a point to go hear (i won't mention names cause y'all niggas have big enough heads as it is!). So my Brown's loving friend have fun in Cleveland and send us all a postcard from the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. Big-ups to the EXTEMELY diverse Steel City Massive and all who support it and create it.

hahahha mediocre record stores?  Ive been to record stores all over the world and I still think Cleveland is home to one of the best record stores I have ever seen in my life.  Bent Crayon.  Im not argueing which is better Cleveland or Pittsburgh...I could really care less.   But those who know, realize that Cleveland is very lucky to have a store like the Bent Crayon.

Subject: {pb-cle} New Dj Brad Anderson Website...

hey everyone.

Not that it is of any importance,  I finally got a real web site:

    http://www.djbradanderson.com/

It's the same old web site that (some of you) found or visited over the last year or so, but it's got a new domain name.  Are there any web masters out there who would like a shot at redesigning it?  if not, I'll do it myself.  Email back here if you are interested.

In the next few months, I'll be posting some songs that I've produced.
Brad Anderson
DJ<  Producer<  Remixer<

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Clev better than Pgh scene :(

actually i said some 'mediocre "record players"' meaning dj's who have no skills...thats my little term for dj's who beatmatch and think they are awesome. But you bring up an interesting point...i've never been to Bent Crayon and i'm sure it's great...but i think the 'Burgh has a one up on Cle in that dept. too! We can debate this all day but i encourage you to come on a little field trip with me to some stores here (bring yo wallet cause you'll shit when you see some of the spots here). Once again I will not mention names of stores because there are a few secrets in this city and i'd like to keep it that way...does anyone in pittsburgh have anything to say about this one? There's a lot of gems buried around the 3 rivers.

Anyone who writes songs, I've been looking at some business models for starting a label.  If you produce (or remix), and you are interested in potentially seeing your work pressed just email me back.

The time frame on this is about 6-10 months.  Also anyone interested in possibly being a business associate on this as well, email me back.

Hey, all, Just found out that my all-time favorite club and the site of some 
of the most perverse, raunchy, ass-kicking nights the U.S. has ever seen, 
NYC's Limelight, is reopening this weekend.  For those that haven't been, 
it's in four-story 19th century cathedral that kicks much ass. The man, the 
myth, the legend, Tony Humphries will playing, as will Deep Dish. There is a 
secret password to get you in for free.  If anyone on here that I know wants 
to go, hit me up in private and I'll hook you up with the password, if you 
don't already have it.
Tony Humphires, enough said.

all you need to do in cleveland is go to Touch and pretty much
every good kind of music is covered in a nice enviroment. i pick
Touch over the entire city of pgh, for sure. cleveland does have
more better shit going on.

if you're looking for the house or techno connection, bent crayon has the
best selection this side of Berlin _for real_.  john also has a very
respectable collection of electro, dim, and other crazy shit.  if you're
looking for stuff of the ravey persuasion (hard house, trance, breaks, etc)
I doubt you will find a single record.  otherwise his store is the

And don't even ASK for Trance, house, etc.

When I was much younger and much more foolish, I had the balls to ask him if
he had any trance.  The looks I recevied were... well, I won't forget them.

I'm not much wiser.

Ha!  Yes, not to say theres nothing going on in cleveland, but where you
been ace?! there has been plenty of shit every single day of the week in
pittsburgh to check out!  God damn.

Monday - Hi Bias (dnb, hip hop), revolve (mixed)
Tuesday - Velvet(house, techno, electro broken beat, etc), Get Drizzy
(dnb)
Wednesday - Electrasoul!!! (techno), Fuze (dnb)
Thursday - Regenerate (mixed), Havana (house, techno, etc)
Friday - Groove (mixed), Adrenaline (breaks, trance, house)
Saturday - Life Support (every other sat - dnb)
Sunday - All-Star Game (deep house)

Not to mention things more on the hip hop rare grovoe and reggae side
which also happen quite frequently

Lets see with all those things, it practically "runs the gamut" across
almost all electronic music genres.  you have to be a complete idiot to
say there is nothing going on in pittsburgh.

EVERY SINGLE FUCKING NIGHT OF THE WEEK I CAN GO OUT AND HEAR COMPETENT DJS
PLAYING GOOD MUSIC, IN PITTSBURGH.  THIS IS WHY THE SCENE IS DYING BECAUSE
PEOPLE LIKE YOU CLAIM THERE AINT SHIT TO DO AND DONT SUPPORT WHAT IS GOING
ON.

Subject: {pb-cle} pgh things


Right, there are so many things going on that I somehow forgot about some.

Friction @ peters pub (upstairs) on saturdays has much much potential. the
space is off the hook and if we could get it packed w/ people it would be
incredible.

The souljazz crew also throws dnb/hiphop/turntablism events, for info on
those checkout http://souljazz.homestead.com ,,

there is so much going on in this town. granted if you are under 21 there
isn't as much, but there are at least 2 or 3 things to check out in a
given week.

Subject: {pb-cle} cle things [was Re: pgh things]

lets not kid ourselves here. obviously there are some things going 
on in pgh that im really digging, most especially havana thursday 
nights. sunday nights at pug IG have been hot when ive gone. and 
tuesday nights and monday nights at zythos have both been good 
whenever ive gone. but just check out the lineup for the next 2 
weeks at touch: 

http://www.touchsupperclub.com/schedule.htm?

mr fucking scruff on the 23rd followed by john tejada on the 30th. 
and the guys who do the first friday of every month have had 
people like rjd2, the guy who owns ubiquity records, etc etc. 
thats just fucking ridiculous. plus the sheer style of the flyers 
and the venue and the diversity of their regualar music blows away 
pretty much everything in pgh. its like taking every decent night 
in any genre, wrapping it up into one dope ass club, and dropping 
it in cleveland. im so insanely jealous that pgh would never be 
able to handle a club like touch. everytime i go im flabbergasted 
by how many 21+ people there are there that are totally into the 
music being played, no matter how crazy it is. read the reviews of 
touch:

http://www.touchsupperclub.com/press.htm?

and this is just ONE CLUB. that totally discounts every single 
other possible club night/venue in the city. im sure there's at 
least a couple interesting things going on outside of touch. 

then on to the record stores.......

once again, i do love the pgh record shops. i have excellent 
relationships with the owners of all 3 pgh rave related record 
shops. they can usually find and get me the things im looking for. 
but im not even going to try to front on bent crayon. 

http://www.bentcrayon.com/

the only time ive been more in awe of a new record store was when 
i first hit amoeba in san fran. and while BC doesnt compare to 
amoeba, its without question the second best new record shop ive 
ever been to. 

so basically to sum it up, cleveland has the best club and club 
nights ive ever been to (blowing away even the shit i went to in 
san fran, except i do prefer the no smoking thing) and the second 
best record shop ive ever been in. basically if the steelers moved 
to cleveland, id be right behind them.

And what makes it worse is knowing that the availability is here, it just

Matrix is a dope venue wasted on semi-mainstream interests and frequented by
meatheads and mullets trying to fit in....

Same with Rock Jungle (even if the acoustics in that place DO suck, it still
COULD be something).

I think the trick is convincing all these "promoters" who lose their asses
throwing parties to support this sort of organization.

It could happen with Groove, it should have happened a long time ago with
Groove. I am at a loss to find that missing ingredient.

shit man, even level could have been very awesome, but it didnt 
work out. as a matter of fact, the basement of level really 
reminded me of the basement of touch in a lot of ways. the low 
ceiling and nice decor made for a tight vibe down there when 
people were actually into the music. as of right now, the best 
vibe of any club in the city that ive been to has got to be 
havana. its so nice and laid back and intimate. of course, havana 
is too damn small to consider doing a headliner type event like 
touch has on the weekends. 

>Sad but true. Pittsburgh just can't pull numbers like that...

300+ 21 and up people dancing past 3 am to jazzanova? 
hahahahahaha. if they played pgh they get like 5 people there and 
theyd all go home at midnight. pgh is fucking stupid.

groove has tons of problems, not the least of which is the venues. 
laga and m are just not what its all about. i always thought 
rosebud was kinda nice, but im just a little wary of the strip 
district kinda crowd in general. one of the reasons i think touch 
is so dope is cause its not right in the flats, so the people who 
go there are the people who WANT to be there, theyre not just 
walking around looking for something to do. another thing that is 
consistant every time ive been to touch is the lineups. often 
times, they have no locals playing at all. which doesnt really 
bother me at all on the big weekend nights. the night jazzanova 
played, it was just jazzanova and the other guy whose name is 
escaping me right now. then when i saw algorithim, it was just 
algorithim and jwan. instead of cramming in 500 deejays, they just 
give it up to 2 deejays all night, and that gives them lots of 
leeway to play different kinds of things. and as far as groove 
goes, their music is also quite lacking, IMO. i know this shit is 
going to just annoy people, but i dont think that playing trance, 
breaks, prog house, etc is going to draw anything but the lowest 
common denominator. the genius of touch is that they play GOOD, 
DEEP fucking music. techno, house, broken beats, dub, hiphop, etc. 
no bullshit cheeseball music. oh well.

I'll chime in here.  Mike is right the bent crayon has had and will have a
very good selection of electronic music.  I do most of my purchasing online
from stores that I can't even understand the languages but I have repeatedly
come across nothing but good things about bent crayon.  It's kinda
surprising to be surfing through some swedish techno website and find a link
to the bent crayon in Cleveland.

Subject: {pb-cle} MR SCRUFF @ TOUCH THIS SAT NOV 23

Hey crew. Very rarely do I make a personal statement in forums and message 
boards. I feel I should this time. To all those who don't know...pay 
attention! Ninja Tune's very own Mr Scruff is coming to Cleveland this 
Saturday. He is making an extremely rare appearance at Touch for the bonus 
9th installment of the monthly party "NITTY GRITTY"! Mr. Scruff is, by far, 
one of the best DJ/Producers of fine funk, soul, hip-hop, dub, etc. He is 
known for his preference to shed all barriers and mix whatever will move to 
crowd and keep a smile on your face. His flawless sets, tight production and 
eccentric humor has earned him top honors at home in the UK and across the 
globe. He'll be playing for 5 hours this Sat Nov 23rd to packed house of 
sweaty party people. So if I don't see you there...and I see you 
sad...hanging your head because you missed out...don't say you weren't 
warned. Like NITTY GRITTY...Mr. Scruff is all about the party. See you there!

Here's the goods:

OnPoint Entertainment & Headroom Digital Present...

Clev is better b/c Jea Leigh spins in the Cleveland

I've played in Pitts once and Clev once, and I had WAY fun in Pitts.  Cleveland was a lot of 
fun too, though.

Although I still list Pitts as one of my favorite places to play, along with Miami and 
Kentucky (of all places, heh)

I have much more fun in Pittsburgh with the dnb scene there, and its only
due to the fact that I dont get to see alot of those people on a basis like
I do here in Cleveland.

Like I said before tho, I wouldnt mind seeing both cities working with each
other to enjoy the same experiences that each have.

ps. Im tired.

I was under the impression that they did, but I guess not, huh.  


Over here, New England itself is one big scene, that is comprised of multiple cities 
(Boston (where I live), Worcester, Portland, Portsmouth (my hometown), Nashua, Manchester, 
Hartford, Springfield, New Haven, Providence, Burlington), with Boston (and maybe 
Providence) being the only one that has a distinct scene seperate/different from the 
Greater New England Rave Scene, as well as being a part of it (not to say each city isn't 
unique, but you know what I mean).

We work together, just cause it's silly not to, and each of the cities are fairly small, 
but also, everything is so close together, so it doesn't make sense NOT to work together.

What are you guys, 2-3 hours apart?

Im just referring to the local djs really. Local support from both cities
and what not. I wouldnt mind seeing some of Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinatti
coming about too.
Im more involved in the dnb scene for Pitts, and Cleveland and havent seen
to many of the area's outside locals coming in. I know that Control The
Night has a view thats being followed, and are working on doing just that.

Alaska just came out to play, and Ratana is coming December 13th, (if im not
mistaken)
More of the 412dnb heads are coming out on Sundays for Pressure,(which is
held in the flats at the Bottom Line.)
I just personally like seeing this area expand each other's scene a little
bit farther so everyone's experiences are equally positive. I wish I could
get out a little more for the other towns, but I work so much that its hard
for me to even make plans with someone, and not be called into work.

Seeing that your kinda mentioning a larger area, our scene here isnt
supportive enough to hold, nor bring that many people to come to events. Im
kinda thinking that maybe if we all worked amungst each other, that its
possible to bring those out, who dont come out on a normal basis.

Im not saying we dont work with each other for a reason. I think it just
doesnt happen because there isnt anyone here that's really working on it.
Ive chatted about, and seen whats going on, and heard some planning for the
future that might actually change all that. Im happy to hear honestly.

Our expand to Pittsburgh from Cleveland is about 2.5 hours. From here to
Cincy is about 4.

I dunno..  jus rambling. I know i left some things out, but im so tired.
May i be excused? :P

pittsburgh's jungle "scene" is a joke. the oldest people involved 
in it are alaska, bagel, and nick if he's around. and theyve been 
in it not so long comparatively. i mean, even soji-fu is a 
somewhat refreshingly familair face to me now. ive seen waves of 
drum and bass suckers come up and fall down, adding nothing and 
taking everything. all the old people, the ones whose influence 
rolls down to the younger/less experienced crews, are gone. the 
people arent the same, at all. they dont act the same. SCJ used to 
be much much fun. now you have the BBT where its a bunch of heavy 
metal white kids wearing meshbacked hats. i truly blame all the 
people who left (and cool with every one of them, so i hold no 
hostility) the jungle masses with nothing to guide them for the 
great decline. the illutrious deejays dieselboy, sine, saint, 
farmer t, etc etc all took all their experience and went elsewhere 
with it. and i dont see any of them rushing to move back here, so 
i guess this scene cant be THAT dope, eh? i guess if you like 
heavy metal youre set. i cant really say much about cleveland's 
jungle scene. it seems like you guys had a pretty serious exodus 
from the locale as well. i can remember kevin cunningham living 
there. i guess tiktak is still in the house, so thats gotta be 
good. those 2 guys who did a jump up tagteam were around a bit 
back in like 97, cant remember their names, they always 
played "gold" off the formation color series. 

and of course i blame the decline in the quality of the popular 
jungle as well. though i guess even Sine started playing 
exclusively heavy shit once he moved out to philly, so perhaps 
even having him stay here wouldnt have helped. the other old pgh 
guys who all played in various styles have quit playing jungle im 
almost every instance. jungle has had its day. im still pissed i 
missed so much of it myself. 

fuck jungle.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Clev better than Pgh scene



I kind of take offense to this.

It's true that pittsburgh predominantly likes the hard heavy metal stuff,
but that's true all over the US, in any city.

You like to talk so much shit but when have you even been to any of the
drum n bass events going on here? like maybe 5% of all the shit that's
happened in the last 3 years?  I bet I could probably name a ton of people
who HATE drum n bass that have actually been around the drum n bass nights
and events in this town more than you have!

The scene here is actually the least inbred of any regional jungle scene
I know of, with everyone getting to play everywhere, and new people given
a chance all the time.  That is something great in and of itself.  you
would have played out more if you hadn't burned all your bridges w/ the
promoters!

As far as the music goes, just because you gave up on it doesnt mean other
people have, and arent doing the same kind of crate digging and careful
selection that you ideally would do.  There are plenty of people around
that play all kinds of good shit.  But you dont go out to hear them or
support them!  Personally I do feel that people here need to open their
minds to the 85% of the rest of DNB that is out there, as well as do their
homework and look back to the past, to see where DNB is coming from.  But
talking shit isn't the way to make that happen!

oh shoosh. youre the exception to the rule here, and you know it. 
i remind you of it all the time. the fact that i like the shit you 
play should say all that needs to be said about that. 

>It's true that pittsburgh predominantly likes the hard heavy 
metal stuff,

i dont know man, in other cities they still do get the atmospheric 
people. san fran especially, but in other cities there is more 
diversity(mainly the bigger ones). even toronto still has the jump-
up massive. christ, i wish pgh had a jump up massive.

thats true, but they dont hate drum and bass like i do. the 
difference between hating something you dont know about or like 
and hating something youve been part of is huge.

eh. for the most part the new people dont have shit to offer and 
you know it. im not into the whole "dons" thing where no one else 
gets a chance, but even here which to you is not so bad the non-
hard shit is shunned by morons who dont know anything other than 
it. so even the "openness" doesnt mean shit, cause all it means is 
that you can spin but no one will like it : ) 

>As far as the music goes, just because you gave up on it doesnt

i listed the people that did give it up, many of the original 
people, people who put more into it than i can even describe. and 
like i said, even the people still into the music have given up on 
anything other than the hard shit. even method one is now spinning 
hard shit. its a sad sad state. 

>and arent doing the same kind of crate digging and careful

because i really dont care anymore. i have you to listen to, and 
thats all i need to feed my desire for good new jungle, since 
there really isnt much of it and youre a completist like i was.

eh, but im allowed to talk shit because i know better and ive been 
around about as long as most of the "scene" people. im like the 
crochity old man who talks about the "good ol' days".

Or to stop calling it "DNB", perhaps?  It's Hardcore, which a large collection of styles of 
various breakbeat-based rave musics.

You are like the only one who persists in calling it "hardcore" today.
Personally I dont feel that "happy hardcore" and drum n bass go together
in the same set. difference of opinion I guess.

Look, I don't need your condescending attitude, nor do I need you to tell
me to look anything up.  You insist upon your particular difference of
opinion, but I don't care.. nor do many on here.  You continue to be a
presence on this list, if only to mostly chime in in your condescending
tone about what you feel "hardcore" is, and to say how "fun" and "awesome"
the Pittsburgh scene is, as if this list was still a relevant place to
troll for gigs.

Go away!  Please!  I'm not the only one that wants you to!

Subject: {pb-cle} Tha scene thAng...

I wasnt really referring to Pittsburgh's club nites, or bar nites really... I was more referring to tha lack of actual events that arent weekly or bi-weekly or somethin...

Now Adam was right when he said theres plenty of good music around here...

He is one of them worth hearing week after week.

Theres good club nites, quality DJs, and decent Live acts that do come thru Pittsburgh.  I commend Tim & Ted, Adam, Jason C @ Havana, and whoever tha fuck runs Life Support (I think Adam and tha Downlow crew) You guys do a lot for this city to have some shit to do and serve up some good tunes to go out and shake our collective Pittsburgher asses to...

BUT, I'd just like to see something worth getting REALLY excited about, besides Mystic Motion... :\  

Like...for instance... Keoki ;)

peace yall.
Chris

damn...

lol, your such and instigator Ian.  you asked for that one.

It got me thinking though, if you listen to what ratana spins you can hear 
that its not that uk hardcore sounding at all.  i don't think theres a 
sampled breakbeat in any of the tracks on his new mix, no pitched melody 
vocals/samples, no machine gun rolls, no pitch ladders.  only sampled drum 
sounds, bass, and soundscape.  He spins soulful deep dnb, almost sounds 
housey at times.  It doesn't even sound very "Hardcore", like many of the 
banging amen, "heavy metal", tracks out there.  I'd save the term hardcore 
for really aggressive stuff personally.

THIS IS NOT A START OF A GENERE NAME WAR

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Clev better than Pgh scene

I have spent lots of time in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Dayton and Columbus and 
every city has its strong and weak points.  Its the same with talent also, 
no matter where you go your going to find extraordinary DJs and also 
mediaocre ones.  With everyone being so close together its a shame not to 
see more local promoters trying to bridge the gap between cities by booking 
more of the out of town talent.  I see a problem with local music scenes 
becoming stale for just that same reason.  If every week after week you are 
exposed to the excact same DJs how will you ever learn to appreciate what 
else is out there?

"supporting" the local scene....
that's something to consider....

for tom cox----
more importantly, each person's "support" has
passive or active influence. obviously, many have
"given up" on their respective local scenes
(assuming a liberal definition of giving up)-
always for personal reasons. Regardless of the
degree of credibility for those reasons, these
people's reactions are thus passive..
withdraw..escape.

there are some who will regularly complain about
local scenes, or spout off about how this shit
ain't cool like it used to be; many of this kind
will attend new local things anyway, often just
to keep the shit from dying or whatever. here you
have some activity----- 
support by attendance...ok..

and engaging in consistent declaration of how
hopeless and weak shit is... a rather fruitless
and tiresome activity i think.

whether you're cool with the best of them or not,
why blame the elder innovators of your local
scene for its "deterioration"?? because
they left town? because they play different shit
or pursue productions and what not? because what?
dieselboy, farmer t, sine and such are not even
remotely responsible for anyone now active in
pittsburgh.

legendary as some legends may be, the past is not
a scapegoat or an excuse for the present--
if you can share your thoughts that the local
scene to you is not that dope, what's the next
step? if you can "truly blame" the past
participants for this great decline, what does
that do for you? active talk about the past walk,
with no talk about what now to fix it- just
passive silence.

....maybe the "scene" is non-existent and beyond
fixing to you.. maybe it's a thing of the past or
it's a concept just for dorks...if that is so,
what is the need to justify "why" you blame who
you blame in theory, by reminding listmembers
about how cool you are with them in real life? if
jungle is fucked, if electronic music, the local
scenes and the pb-cle raves are generally getting
full of taint, which supervisor of your worth on
this list do you have to answer to? who are you
so concerned might taint your reputation if you
had not made so clear AGAIN that you've got pals
with play? 

the history of pittsburgh is not the pittsburgh
scene. what happened then is independent of  what
happens now. if you don't care about what will
happen in the future to Pittburgh's music culture
in general, then just say so and admit it. 

if you do care, "you" and "now" are the 2 biggest
priorities. what will happen tomorrow depends on
what you do now, not on what others think or what
happened last decade.


so how bout them cleveland browns....

g-ride

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Clev better than Pgh scene :(

Well...I agree and disagree.  There are some Ohio Djs I
always like to hear.  Moose being one.  Hutch being
another.  Lemma, Soniq...I could give you more if you
wanted.  But I'm not going to.  Sure, there aren't AS
MANY local DJs in Cleveland I want to hear.  But then
again, maybe I just don't know what hidden treasures
they have that I haven't discovered.  The only reason I
know who rocks in this town is that I'm going out and
hearing them.  I know who's guarenteed to tear shit up,
cause I see em do it time and again.  This list is
dominated largely by Pittsburgh folks it seem.  Or
people who at least come to the Burgh every once in a
while.  Who the fuck goes to Cleveland?  Not many
people.  Say maybe we just don't know?  Or maybe there
really isn't anyone out there?  Or maybe there wasn't
for a while, so we just assume that's how it's stayed.
Every city is gonna have at least 1 semi-decent dj
who's got his shit together and knows what the fuck
he's doing.  Doesn't mean we are gonna know all of
them.  And I'm actually okay with that.  I can't know
everyone that's everywhere that's worth his weight in
records.  But the ones I do know are rocking it.  It
shouldn't matter what city they're in.  Cause Djs who
are good that aren't sitting at home with their thumbs
up their asses are to some extent gonna be out and
about so I can find out about them.

I think I just rambled a lot there.  Ugh, I need sleep.
Umm....Skillz has nice Michael Jackson-esque nipples.
I've seen em.

  As far as this goes I must point out that people from other countries and other states across the world have been talking rather highly about the Pittsburgh-Cleveland area.  One performer from Detroit was even quoted as saying "This area is the next Chicago".  With Chicago being the city in the US with the largest attendance for these types of events.  After the recent electro label Bunker Records tour featureing Legowelt and Orgue Electronique live from Den Haag, Holland, they said that Cleveland was their favorite city they played.  After the Cleveland show I followed the Bunker gang to Detroit.  The sound was weak, no visuals, and the crowd was smaller.  Not a whole lot of effort on the promoters part IMO and not as much enthusiasm in the crowd.  With Cutups Wrecked promotions in Pittsburgh and myself and Headroom here in NE Ohio (yes I know im biased but) we have managed to get some things going on while gaining momentum every step of the way.

  I think the key at this point is for sub-scenes to crossover and work together to create an interesting and diverse atmosphere again.  Be a part of each other and work together.  For people to stop being afraid of new things, sounds, and ideas.  As well us pretentious avant-garde types need to stop being so jaded towards anything with a straight forward beat, or younger kids danceing around in lasers with glowsticks and phat pants.  We need new genres that take these more experimental aspects but still retain a highly danceable quality  (ie Electro, and Glitch house type stuff like Akufen and Farben.  Should have seen the dancefloor when Akufen played at touch or when Legowelt played in Cleveland)  Things need to get mixed up a bit and I feel now is the time to bring it all together again.  Lets see the return of the Ambient/Experimental room at your traditional parties.  Traditions need broken but in all honesty traditions are already broken but I should say they need fixed.  When things first started out it was all about progression and being introduced to a new sound every week with parties where you can go dance your ass off in one room then go chill and zone out in another room with some mental ass shit.  Hell fuck it...lets get rowdy to some breakcore and get a crazy mosh pit going...hahahaha.  Wouldnt that be a site...a glowing mosh pit...hahahaha.  I dont know about everyone else but I am tottaly willing to work with others to make things like this happen and to evolve.  These are reasons I stick around on lists like this and lolli.  Even though these lists and message boards hardly ever touch upon the things I am into I stick around so I can see what other people are into and drop names of stuff I am into hopeing to broaden a few peoples tastes.  Especially Lolli.  I think if a person is going to be into electronic music they should know and have a taste of everything that is out there.  I dont do these things or throw the events I do because I think it makes me look "cool" (contrary to popular beleif), and I definetly dont do it for money (pulls pockets inside out).  It just happens that these are the things I am into and I want to be able to go out to hear, enjoy, and support what I love and hopefully turn a few other people onto it as well. But all in all I just think things need to be diversified again.  People think "oh we cant have this style and that style at the same event".  Why not?

  Anyways I honestly think things will get better through crossing back over and working together again.  Imagine what could happen if everyone pulled their resources to make on big diverse amazing event happen (remember the family affairs?)  I know euphorix has shown interest in makeing some of these things happen and I know I am too.  I propose an event in the future....4 room event 2 Euphorix managed rooms rooms, and two Headroom/Experimedia managed rooms (one for danceable oddball stuff and some breakcore, and one for chillout stuff.  Visuals in every room.  It would be fucking great.  I would even like to see something happen next summer.  Huge outdoor venue with several stages.  All weekend event.  Even if we just rounded up every local/regional dj, artist, performer, producer, visual artist, promoter, etc, etc it would loaded with amazing talent and be a blast and something to remember.

  Im done rambling for now but I think this is something everyone involved in the scene or a scene should consider and think about the possibilities.

for everyone---
"supporting" the local scene....
that's something to consider....

for tom cox----
more importantly, each person's "support" has
passive or active influence. obviously, many have
"given up" on their respective local scenes
(assuming a liberal definition of giving up)-
always for personal reasons. Regardless of the
degree of credibility for those reasons, these
people's reactions are thus passive..
withdraw..escape.

there are some who will regularly complain about
local scenes, or spout off about how this shit
ain't cool like it used to be; many of this kind
will attend new local things anyway, often just
to keep the shit from dying or whatever. here you
have some activity----- 
support by attendance...ok..

and engaging in consistent declaration of how
hopeless and weak shit is... a rather fruitless
and tiresome activity i think.

whether you're cool with the best of them or not,
why blame the elder innovators of your local
scene for its "deterioration"?? because
they left town? because they play different shit
or pursue productions and what not? because what?
dieselboy, farmer t, sine and such are not even
remotely responsible for anyone now active in
pittsburgh.

legendary as some legends may be, the past is not
a scapegoat or an excuse for the present--
if you can share your thoughts that the local
scene to you is not that dope, what's the next
step? if you can "truly blame" the past
participants for this great decline, what does
that do for you? active talk about the past walk,
with no talk about what now to fix it- just
passive silence.

....maybe the "scene" is non-existent and beyond
fixing to you.. maybe it's a thing of the past or
it's a concept just for dorks...if that is so,
what is the need to justify "why" you blame who
you blame in theory, by reminding listmembers
about how cool you are with them in real life? if
jungle is fucked, if electronic music, the local
scenes and the pb-cle raves are generally getting
full of taint, which supervisor of your worth on
this list do you have to answer to? who are you
so concerned might taint your reputation if you
had not made so clear AGAIN that you've got pals
with play? 

the history of pittsburgh is not the pittsburgh
scene. what happened then is independent of what
happens now. if you don't care about what will
happen in the future to Pittburgh's music culture
in general, then just say so and admit it. 

if you do care, "you" and "now" are the 2 biggest
priorities. what will happen tomorrow depends on
what you do now, not on what others think or what
happened last decade.


so how bout them cleveland browns....

Subject: {pb-cle} Southern Culture on the Skids

I was at a show in Rosebud last night that kicked my ass. I never expected 
myself to be attending or liking this kind of music, but it was just too 
fun. BR5-49 and Southern Culture on the Skids were awesome.

I guess that the name BR5-49 is from some Hee-Haw skit. They had a guy that 
looked just like Hank Sr. and could sing like a bunch of classic country 
crooners. The bassist had a big ole double bass that was painted with that 
chameleon paint. It was predominantly green but went to a bunch of colors 
and had scallops pinstriped on it. They also had this guy playing a tenor 
guitar, steel guitar and electric fiddle with fervor that could make just 
about anyone give honky tonk a chance. They rocked some standards but had 
all original words for them. My favorite line of the evening was "Rich girls 
use Vaseline, poor girls use lard. My girl uses axle grease, and takes it 
twice as hard."

Southern Culture on the Skids was great too, but I think the openers were 
the highlight of the evening. Anyway S.C.O.T.S is a whiskey swilling, foam 
and mesh, trailer trash set with a keyboardist that easily goes 275 and 
looks like he rolled off his Missouri cousin to rock out for us. The bassist 
looks like some kind of surreal version of Flo from Mel's Diner being 
envisioned by Hunter S in the depths of an ether binge. Big fat red beehive 
ala the chick from B-52s. They have some reasonably popular songs out, one 
of which is "8-piece box." Crazy song that is supposedly about fried 
chicken, but has lots of allusions to other sorts of boxes...i.e. of the 
female persuasion. Anyway to end the evening they got all the redneck 
country girls (at least costumed like that) to get up on the stage, go-go 
dance, take a hunk or two out of a some greasy fried chicken, throw the rest 
of the chicken out at the crowd and grab another piece. It was decadent, 
white-trash, drunken insanity...and I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

So anyway, hows come no one is talking about Shadow on Tuesday? Its going on 
right?

Ahhhh.... to say Jeremy's comments here are
proper would be quite an understatement.
Expansion and evolution can only come from
sharing the unconventional, the experimental and
genres beyond description. Let's have Titonton,
Ed Luna, Twine, Headroom Digital and Bible,
Phoenicia, Boards, Wesley Willis Venetian Snares,
Doormouse, DJ Slugo, knifehandchop and Pimp Daddy
Welfare.....and others get on this outdoor summer
venture. Genius shit like Y2Kid's C.Y.O.A theme
to break the tension and return the crossing of
minds.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Clev better than Pgh scene

This is totally switching the topic up and bastardizing the point of the 
original post. So sue me.

The mention of Titonton Duvante makes me think of G-Spot when he dropped 
Billy Joel's "For the Longest Time" into his mix. You could feel the vibe 
blast through the roof when it came in and I got goosebumps and shivers much 
like when I bite into a York Peppermint Patty.

Yous guys member that?

Ahhhh.... to say Jeremy's comments here are
proper would be quite an understatement.
Expansion and evolution can only come from
sharing the unconventional, the experimental and
genres beyond description. Let's have Titonton,
Ed Luna, Twine, Headroom Digital and Bible,
Phoenicia, Boards, Wesley Willis Venetian Snares,
Doormouse, DJ Slugo, knifehandchop and Pimp Daddy
Welfare.....and others get on this outdoor summer
venture. Genius shit like Y2Kid's C.Y.O.A theme
to break the tension and return the crossing of
minds.

traditions are already broken but I should say they need fixed. <<<<<<

Yes, this is so true... it seems "rave" culture has been labeled as any
music with a 4/4 130 BPM electronic beat.  I have been saying this for quite
some time.   I've also been saying that it disgusts me when when "rave" djs
(who are supposed to be underground) are playing eurobeat/hi energy artists
like DJ Sammy, Ian Van Dahl, etc.

These "traditions" you refer to are not traditions at all -- they are
STEREOTYPES re-inforced by the mainstream mentality that has overrun the
underground.   You can't go to a party and hear anything that does not fit
into the "acceptable" definition of "underground".  If you don't play
hi-energy, the kids label you downtempo.   If you try to do something new
and different, the people just wonder into the next room.

I think we need more clubs geared towards furthering electronic music.
Cheap drinks, good sound, and 7 nights a week.


>>> When things first started out it was all about progression and being
introduced to a new sound every week with parties where you can go dance
your ass off in one room then go chill and zone out in another room with
some mental ass shit.<<<<

Even a room of non-banging music would be start.


>>>   Anyways I honestly think things will get better through crossing back
over and working together again.  Imagine what could happen if everyone
pulled their resources to make on big diverse amazing event happen (remember
the family affairs?)  I know euphorix has shown interest in makeing some of
these things happen and I know I am too.  I propose an event in the
future....4 room event 2 Euphorix managed rooms rooms, and two
Headroom/Experimedia managed rooms (one for danceable oddball stuff and some
breakcore, and one for chillout stuff.  Visuals in every room.  It would be
fucking great.  I would even like to see something happen next summer.  Huge
outdoor venue with several stages.  All weekend event.  Even if we just
rounded up every local/regional dj, artist, performer, producer, visual
artist, promoter, etc, etc it would loaded with amazing talent and be a
blast and something to remember.<<<<<

Hell yeah.  Group effort events have been talked about quite a bit in the
past here in Cleveland -- but usually they don't happen because everyone
wants to further their own agenda.   Promoter E won't work with promoter F
because they are "shadey"... and promoters A B and  C won't work with anyone
because their potential to make money is diminished.

I am all about group effort... it would be really nice to have some unity
back in the scene.

Subject: {pb-cle} passion


Hey reading jeremy's post and dougs post, and everyones post about this
music bizness.. jeremy mentioned lolli and that got me thinking.

does it seem to you that the people who are how old we were when we
started getting into this music, do they seem less passionate about music,
and more passionate about other things (if at all?) to you?

Kids could care less if there was an ambient/chill room anymore.  The main
room is their chill room... when the "headlienr" is not on they are
socializing and chilling, not paying attention to any music.  Does anyone
else share this observation?

How do we get kids passionate about music again?  Is it just not new
enough anymore? Even though it wasn't that new to begin with 5 years ago,
8 years ago, etc (but was still much more new than it is now).

  Im just referring to the local djs really. Local support from both =
cities
  and what not. I wouldnt mind seeing some of Columbus, Dayton, and =

  coming about too.
  Im more involved in the dnb scene for Pitts, and Cleveland and havent =

that.

  Alaska just came out to play, and Ratana is coming December 13th, (if =
im not
  mistaken)
  More of the 412dnb heads are coming out on Sundays for Pressure,(which =
is
  held in the flats at the Bottom Line.)
  I just personally like seeing this area expand each other's scene a =
little

could
  get out a little more for the other towns, but I work so much that its =
hard
  for me to even make plans with someone, and not be called into work.

  Seeing that your kinda mentioning a larger area, our scene here isnt

events. Im
  kinda thinking that maybe if we all worked amungst each other, that =
its
  possible to bring those out, who dont come out on a normal basis.

  Im not saying we dont work with each other for a reason. I think it =
just
  doesnt happen because there isnt anyone here that's really working on =
it.
  Ive chatted about, and seen whats going on, and heard some planning =
for the
  future that might actually change all that. Im happy to hear honestly.

  Our expand to Pittsburgh from Cleveland is about 2.5 hours. From here =
to
  Cincy is about 4.

  I dunno..  jus rambling. I know i left some things out, but im so =
tired.
  May i be excused? :P

Are you sure that was at G-Spot? (in the boathouse next to U4ia on
Feb 14th '98?) I seem to recall him spinning that in Columbus at
Metamorphosis in the fall of '97. 

That *was* incredible. That's my favorite non-rave track ever spun at
a rave.

ABSOLUTELY.  But I'm not sure why -- if it is age or something else.  The
same can be said is true for every other younger generation.  I can try to
look objectively at those younger than me, but I'm not sure what I see.
When I was young, deep house/downtempo/ambient held little or no relevance
to me.  As I grew older my tastes refined.  While I am sure that there were
other people my age who WERE into these genres, it wasn't for me.  THE
PROBLEM is that in this day and age, the young kids aren't even getting
exposed to it.  Money hungry promoters replaced intelligent music with djs
who would draw more people into the party.  That's why I think Jeremy's
suggestion is so relevant... alternative forms of music NEED to be offered
so that people know it is out there.  So that fans of it can find each
other.  So that we can move forward instead of perputate the sameness that
has kept things stagnat.

For me, music was an escape from reality.  I found other people into the
same things I was into.  I felt like I found a home.  And you know what --
even back then -- there were those top40 songs that found there way into the
underground.   I heard c&c music factory for the first time in the GOTH
club.

Now this is true, yes.   I don't know what to say or do about this -- other
than PROVIDE a chill room.

> How do we get kids passionate about music again?  Is it just not new
> enough anymore? Even though it wasn't that new to begin with 5 years ago,

Don't book djs who play proven hits or genres.  Unfortunately, this is an
idealistic route to take.   As soon as you try to create something that is
relevant, educational, and good -- someone will come along and shut you down
in one way or another (booking competing parties with big overpriced
overrated headliners is one way).  The only way to end it is through
unity -- don't allow mediocre events to happen.   I think this is why I have
problems with a few thing in Cleveland right now.

<<How do we get kids passionate about music again?>>

Come up with something that is new and original that they can take ownership
of and make their own.

Kids today are just going through the motions. We're now in the third
generation of "ravers"...people now in their mid-to-late-20's had it handed
down directly from the ones who "originated" in the US...or even in England.

Like any story, as a scene gets handed down, the message gets changed.

I don't think it's ours to come up.  I think in order for them to really
embrace it, they're going to have to think of it up.  Honestly, most of us
are really too old anymore to really be in touch completely with what's
going on.  Yeah, we can certainly keep our fingers in the pie and can do our
best to accommodate and direct their energy, but we can't be expected to be
the fountain of new ideas and ideals.

I know I'll do my own extraordinarily small part to keep things running and
to explore new areas of music and culture.  I know, though, that I can't be
the idea generator as much as I can be the catalyst to see that the ideas
reach fruition.

Ah sheeit, I've pontificated enough.  I'll be quiet now :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} passion

to talk about this, you also have to talk about life-cycle.

ravers who are in it for the music usually end up doing something to
help/promote the music.

ravers who are in it for off-topic substances are in and out of the scene in
less than a year.

the former classification of ravers are the ones that need to be embraced.
the tom cox's of the world shouldnt shoot them down right away... it's a
learning process.  nothing against you, tom, you go ahead and be yourself,
but i remember when i was that guy that you were attempting to shoot down
cause my ideas werent elitist enough for you.  times change, people mature.
you need to let them mature and give encouragement on the good things they
do, and blast them when they are doing detrimental activities to the scene
(ie ecstasy productions as a production co name, needed to be blasted, but
throwing an event by them needed to be embraced)... the best way to
encourage the youth is to give them 2 or 3 chances... go to 2 or 3 events
and if it's not your style, hey, you tried to help em out, but they just
have different ideals than you do.  chances are after giving them more than
one shot, you will rub off on them and give them other ideas to run with,
more than likely the ideas that you are unmotivated to act upon because you
are lazy or scared it wont work... so they become test catalysts... how well
will it work... if it bombs, they learn from it as well as everyone around
them.  if it does well, it opens up another avenue for young and old heads
to expand the scene.  that's how i see getting young heads to be
passionate... just hold their hands when they have motivation, dont shoot em
down, just give em alternative ideas.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} passion

<<I don't think it's ours to come up.  I think in order for them to really
embrace it, they're going to have to think of it up>>

Not necessarily...

We (people of the age 23 to say 30) did not "invent" the rave scene. Some
joined in its infancy, some are "second generation" ravers like myself. But
many still took that ownership, that feeling of "this is ours and we need to
cherish it", and they ran with it.

I, however, was a "closet" raver, or rather, I was in a "geographically and
socio-economically disparate" situation. I lived in the boonies, and
followed what music I could get my hands on (mainly comps like the Speed
Limit series, etc.). I wasn't part of the original scene, but I followed it
as closely as my situation could allow.

<<Honestly, most of us are really too old anymore to really be in touch
completely with what's going on.>>

I don't believe that...not totally, anyway.

I hardly think 26 is right around the corner from Ben Gay and bladder
control products, Paul.   ;-) Age ain't nothin' but a number, and I believe
my best contributions are yet to come. I've only been somewhat-active within
the last 2 years.

I believe there are a number of factors at play here:

1) Bad examples being set-- People who've done too many drugs, treated their
bodies poorly, thrown parties to "make money" (yeah, there's an idea), and a
number of different examples...all these things have set an example in some
form or another to impressionable observers. This dilutes what is real and
true and good.

2) Too many Indian Chiefs, not enough Indians-- The universal law of supply
and demand is still at play here. If there are 40 different nights, styles
of music and events to go to, unification is an impossibility. PLUS, if
every Joe Schmoe is throwing his own party, he's got other things to spend
his money on than YOUR party, and his friends aren't going to go to your
party because Joe is throwing one next week. Again, dilution of the scene.

3) When I say that there needs to be something new and original, I don't
necessarily mean the music or the style of event. Why have concerts
continued to amass the amounts of people? Because they give the people
something unique and real and true. When was the last rave you attended
where something absolutely blew your mind?

I hate to say it, but if individuality isn't encouraged in the Underground,
it may as well be called "mediocre mainstream".

4) THE ELITISTS AND THE "CAN'T BE DONE" ATTITUDES. (and even I'm guilty of
this.)

Subject: {pb-cle} FEAST:  A pre-thanksgiving party

If you don't have plans the night before Thanksgiving (one week from
wednesday), I would like to announce/remind you of the first event that
Grand Poo-bas is helping to host.  If you are interested in attending the
dinner part of the evening, please plan on getting your tickets this week -
they were limited to 50 and 30 of them are already accounted for.  I hope
some of you will want to come out for this, it will be a good time, some
really great music, and definately some very fun people.  Not to mention
both Jes and Nox will be celebrating their birthday!

~~~ FEAST ~~~
November 27 . Wednesday . Cleveland
A night before Thanksgiving gathering to celebrate the bounty of our local
music scene.

Featuring three seperate environments:

The Broken Beat Lounge -- Broken beat house, breaks & drum & bass
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STILL LIFE: Broken beat house early; drum & bass later.
POLLEN: Eric's production of drum & bass tracks puts Cleveland on the music
map for something besides rock n roll.
DJ MOOSE: Part of the breakbeat militia; broken beats of all genres cross
Moose's musical repertoire.


The Hybrid Vibration: Context -- This room is all about the vibe.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
JASON SODITCH: Jason's house vibe overtakes the body and stimulates the
soul.
IAN MARIANO: The founder of n space records. A versatile performer that
takes audiences into new auditory territory.
CHRIS EBERHART: Deep and thick with emotion, prepare to get completely
absorbed in his genre bending vibe.
THE FUTURE CONSORTIUM: Jenn & Henry's talent provide both the visual
landscape for The Hybrid Vibration as well as our flyer design.

The Groove Kitchen
----------------------
STOUT XTC: Deep soulful house.
CUBBY: Rob's skill, track selection, and positive outlook will amaze you as
well as move you on the dancefloor.
EVAN EVOLUTION: Continuing the house vibe, Evan will cover new territory and
bring it all back together to end the evening.

Each room will have different atmosphere, and we recommend that you come
early for a proper experience. Early guests will enter through a special
door into a hidden room where they will be treated to an appetizer buffet
courtesy of The Waterstreet Grill. We do hope you plan on a 9pm arrival.

...admission...
$5 if you are 21
$10 for 18-20

Dress to express yourself, but please remember that Spy Bar is an upscale
club that frowns on hats, backpacks, and sometimes sneakers.  Project a
positive image and make an effort to look good and there won't be a problem.
Creativity is a plus - have fun with it!

~~~ FEAST WITH US! ~~~
The DJs, their friends, and other people in the industry will be meeting at
7pm for dinner at The Waterstreet Grill on the Corner of West 9th and
Johnson. We invite you join us and get to know us a little better. It is our
hope that this unique social setting will help strengthen our local
electronic music scene. You must have a ticket for this part of the
evening - they are available at Grand Poo-bas Record Shoppe for $20, which
includes your admission to the club. You can call 216.521.9177 for more
information.

--=== THIS EVENT IS HOSTED AND PRODUCED BY THE DJS LISTED IN THE LINEUP,
GRAND POO-BAS RECORD SHOPPE, AND THE SPY BAR. IT IS OUR INTENTION TO TURN
THIS EVENT INTO AN ANNUAL SHOWCASE OF LOCAL TALENT. ===---

I really hope that some of you plan on making it out for this.  The djs
involved in this event are all on a mailing list and are actively involved
in planning every detail of the event. It's the first event I have ever
hosted, so it will also be a learning experience.  My goal is to help throw
events that promote unity in the local scene, promote diversity, and to
define the music of our culture one step at a time.  This is my starting
point.

that song is old.  like from 90-91 or something off their first full length
album--"too much pork for one fork". best of the ones i have, i don't have
their last couple albums though.
i think their best song is " Daddy Was a Preacher But Mama Was a Go-Go Girl
"

unfortunately i did miss it.  last time i saw them, it was kinda dull
actually.  they really used to get worked up pretty crazy, i dunno if it was
an off night or not, but so it goes.

i know that mike said this already, but i have to
add my 2 cents since bent crayon has been my
record store for the last 4 years. 99% of my records
are from his store. as far as techno, no other record =20
store in america has the selection john has. every time =20
i go there to buy records he is processing an order to =20
somewhere in europe or asia, that's where he does most
of his sales. =20

as far as the pb-cle scenes, i'll have to say that pittsburgh =20
is more responsive to techno. the last 2 major headliners(stuart
walker and gaetano parisio) we had here in cleveland had like
250 people combined. sad.........

i think everyone misses the rollerskating rinks...nice wooden floors...big
sound systems...proper visual mixing....theres alot to be said for parties
with one huge room....one room one vibe....if someone told me there was a
skating rink party i would be there in an instant...if only because sound
systems sound so nice in huge rooms...

did all the skating rinks in cleveland/akron/lorain co. get pissed off at
ravers yet? or is there still one around that could be used....i know a
coupla places had thier floors destroyed by water and other shit...

but someone with the history needs to interject that, dont they? i

you learn from history.

sure they are. are you joking? without their influence, shit would 
be vastly different here. they shaped things originally. and yeah 
i do blame them for taking what they had, which was some sense of 
credibilty and alot of experience and knowledge, and using it 
elsewhere. not that i blame them entirely! but still, as weak as 
pittsburgh may have been to them then, without them its only 
gotten worse as its lost its history.

who is passive? im working on my shit, making me good. i want this 
city to have credibility and be something just because im here. i 
obviously cant rely on anyone else to stay and represent. so i 
have to devote my energy in the meantime to what i think will make 
the most difference: being more and more knowledgeable about 
music, and making my own songs.

im saying that i am not hostile towards these people, because they 
did and in alot of cases still do great things. i just think they 
should have done it here. a mass exodus of the foundation of the 
jungle scene isnt going to do shit to help it progress.

wow, i never realised history was irrelevant. youre a fucking

and i said that when? ive said again and again that the current 
incarnation is a joke and it needs fixed. however, im not the one 
to fix it. i threw groundbreaking events with PBS and Steel City 
Soul and i just dont care to try again. i have better things to 
worry about. 

>if you do care, "you" and "now" are the 2 biggest
>priorities. what will happen tomorrow depends on

exactly, thats why im working on what i think will make a 
difference. throwing events is not my shit anymore. im working on 
other things, and in the meantime, i can complain about how wack 
shit is all i want, and i certainly think im justified. anyway, i 
am one of the few people who's still around pittsburgh doing shit 
that was around for the old jungle stuff with all the good deejays 
and great people as my influences. and i am taking it on myself to 
be personally responsible for making sure all their work wasnt 
totally wasted. 

>so how bout them cleveland browns....

still in second place to the steelers.

yeah i guess i dont count the hard banging shit as techno. like i 
consider that to be in the same boat as like hardhouse and trance. 
i have no idea how that groove did, but i guess there were a ton 
of people there for richie. i just dont think of pgh as really 
being "into" techno, considering the fact that ive watched shawn 
rudiman play to damn near nobody and he releases records on 
internationally respected techno labels.

I'm positive that wasnt a Groove party... that was definetely Nu-Form...

and if I remember correct, it wasnt packed, but it wasnt empty either... and 
I danced myself into a sweaty mess that nite, and tha Laga security had to 
come help me off tha floor when I collapsed at tha end of his *gasp* 4 hour 
set.

Still one of tha best nites EVER!

Peace.
Chris

with a whole fukkin box of Blow Pops?  They had all tha best Blow Pops too, 
tha green ones, and even tha blue ones... shit, nowadays, we're lucky to get

true, there hasn't really been any "major" techno
headliners in pittsburgh lately, but the support for
their locals is better than cleveland.

the place to be for techno in the midwest is chicago.
all of the big boys/girls have played there in the last
year. adam beyer, cristian varela, umek, marco carola,
misstress barbara, ben sims, headroom, and oliver lieb
to mention a few. i'm going down there this weekend
for richie hawtin & sven vath this friday and andrei morant
this saturday.

peace,

It is this sort of thing that actually gives me stress and the occasional
headache as I try to figure out why, and how (not so much when)!  With my
promoter hat on, I am baffled and somewhat disgusted.  Shawn Rudiman Live
is worth a 2 hour drive, and it's also worth losing sleep!  I'm not on the
guys nuts -- even if I hated him personally, I would still believe this to
be true.  With a technoir label hat on, I just make sure that the recorded
sets we have of him are on the web, and hopefully on file sharing
programs, so that the people all over the world that sweat him can hear
him (and yes there are plenty of people).

Maybe it will get to the point in the US where the only people with a sort
of musical knowledge of the music we hold dear will be a small crowd of
"music nerds," and that the only people involved will be promoters,
producers and deejays, not so much listeners.  It's like that in a lot of
small scenes in a lot of cities, not just the electronic music scene.
With my DJ hat on, I care less and less about playing out and more about
making CDs and things like that so I can capture what the music is to ME
now, and for the people outside of the burgh who care to listen and
download, since for the most part its lost on a live audience here.

Do a poll of lolli, how many kids would know who shawn rudiman is? how
many would know who stewart walker is, dan bell, etc etc.  More
importantly, who would want to hear them, not having ever heard of them?
probably 5% .. that's our scene now.  Lolli has the biggest collection of
scene partygoers now, I would almost guarantee it.  How depressing is
that.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} pgh and techno - frustration!

There is a decent number of people on Lolli who know who Rudiman is, and who 
know good techno as opposed to not even comprehending the techno 
classification, which is what I am sure many believe.

Obviously due to age differences though there are many more kids who are 
fans of Hard House, HHC, Anthem trance and so forth (not necessarily a bad 
thing, just not my bag personally).  Ratana is right when stating that these 
are the largest group of partygoers, but the only way that they are going to 
change is through one thing . . .

EXPOSURE!

It is this sort of thing that actually gives me stress

Do a poll of lolli, how many kids would know who shawn
rudiman is? how
many would know who stewart walker is, dan bell, etc
etc.  More
importantly, who would want to hear them, not having
ever heard of 
them?
probably 5% .. that's our scene now.  Lolli has the
biggest collection 
of
scene partygoers now, I would almost guarantee it. 
How depressing is
that.

once again adam is correct. look on the rom and
see how many techno dj's there are compared to
house and trance. i know that craig k and sasha
are doing a lot better in san fan and texas. oh
yeah and being called a "nerd" if you're into techno
isn't a bad thing. almost all technoheads are nerds.

It is this sort of thing that actually gives me stress and the occasional
headache as I try to figure out why, and how (not so much when)!  With my
promoter hat on, I am baffled and somewhat disgusted.  Shawn Rudiman Live
is worth a 2 hour drive, and it's also worth losing sleep!  I'm not on th=
e
guys nuts -- even if I hated him personally, I would still believe this t=
o
be true.  With a technoir label hat on, I just make sure that the recorde=
d
sets we have of him are on the web, and hopefully on file sharing
programs, so that the people all over the world that sweat him can hear
him (and yes there are plenty of people).

Maybe it will get to the point in the US where the only people with a sor=
t
of musical knowledge of the music we hold dear will be a small crowd of
"music nerds," and that the only people involved will be promoters,
producers and deejays, not so much listeners.  It's like that in a lot of
small scenes in a lot of cities, not just the electronic music scene.
With my DJ hat on, I care less and less about playing out and more about
making CDs and things like that so I can capture what the music is to ME
now, and for the people outside of the burgh who care to listen and
download, since for the most part its lost on a live audience here.

Do a poll of lolli, how many kids would know who shawn rudiman is? how
many would know who stewart walker is, dan bell, etc etc.  More
importantly, who would want to hear them, not having ever heard of them?
probably 5% .. that's our scene now.  Lolli has the biggest collection of

Full Bio for Fabio & Grooverider
 >From playing pirate radio to residing at Britain's most exciting and 
ground breaking clubs, Fabio & Grooverider have forged a path that has 
shaped the sound of drum 'n' bass and been vital in establishing the 
house, techno and early breakbeat scenes in the UK. The duo first hooked 
up in early 1987 at Phase One, a pirate radio station which also 
featured the likes of Colin Dale and David Angel. An instant rapport was 
established as Fabio dropped funk and soul numbers over Grooverider's 
hip hop beats. With acid house, they started DJing together at Mendoza's 
- an after hours haunt in Brixton full of the Shoom crowd. Quickly 
establishing a name for themselves, they began playing all the major 
raves, spinning a mixture of Detroit house and early rave. Fabio & 
Grooverider have always been a couple of steps ahead of their 
contemporaries, laying down early European techno way back in 1989, and 
developing the first UK breakbeat as long ago as 1991 at seminal club 
night Rage. They've also played extensively on the rave and house 
circuits for years, both together and separately.

Subject: {pb-cle} passion and lack there of

I love this list.  There is more intelligent debate and talk about real
things then on any other list I've been on.  I just spent 45 minutes reading
through all the material.  I just have a few points to make.

One of the reasons the scene has changed is because the local and national
climate has changed.  The law enforcement agencies are targeting our venues
and promoters.  They really think that we all do hard drugs and that's the
only reason to listen to this music.  This older generation is trying to
impose its views and values upon us.  The youth of this country are being
corralled into the same consumer mentality and they don't have that "spark".
I think this blend of what I would call problems leads us to only have super
mega "popcorn" clubs and larger "profit focused" promoters.  This in turn
becomes what the youth aspire to be and carries on to my next point.

When was the last time our country has seen it's youth work at a grassroots
level to accomplish goals for themselves and others around them?  Having a
direct impact on someone else's life.  Beyond serving them a burger and
ringing up there clothing purchase.  This is a very special feeling I'm
sure.  But I think this has become diluted.  I think that in America you
don't receive respect or are told you are successful until you are making
big profits.  The main society and culture in America is surrounded by
consumerism.  Of course this boils over into our underground culture.  There
are to many people trying to profit off of art.  I'm not saying people
shouldn't be active.  I just think they need to be active for the right
reasons and we lose site of that in this present climate.

Randy's last party, Relentless in March didn't really have that great of a 
turnout and not all that much techno either.  I'm not sure if he'll ever 
throw a party again or not.

drug addict friends/peers...or think we are better than the next man cuz 
some of us spend lots of money making music/buying music/throwing events...

well i say fuck it all...either go out and have fun(if it doesnt interfere

  I must say that this is one thing that I have not had to worry about with the events I have been involved in.  Yeah our crowds are considerably smaller so Im sure thats a factor but I also think it helps that the more mental genres out there have gained the respect of the arts community and receive support from museums, universities, and publications.  Granted these places arent exactly suited for a "party" atmosphere.  
  As far as bringing the passion back to the younger gens I dont have an absolute remedy for this.  I think all we can do is to mix some new stuff into the usual party atmosphere and expose people to all styles of electronic music.  Even if doing this doesnt effect many people it is bound to grab at least a few peoples interest and possibly result in a dramatic effect on their outlook on music.  I know from personal experience that for the first few years I followed the scene I was just another young kid going out and getting high.  While I still feel that my passion for music was a big part of why I went to these events I do have to admit that there were plenty of times I went for all the wrong reasons.  After 2 years or so of this I gradually started to lose my passion for the music for some reason until I was turned on to the more obscure sounds.  Industrial being my earliest influence on my tastes I realized that this is what I was searching for all along.  I just didnt know it existed beyond Aphex Twin and Autechre.  This was a huge revolution in my life and tottaly brought my passion for music and life back.  I felt like I was 10 hearing Skinny Puppy for the first time from the neighborhood freak all over again.  Greg and Chad from Twine also played a big part in opening my eyes to vast amount of amazing music that was hideing between the cracks.  Seeing them play at some of their early events is what really helped me find my path.  I think our area has been really lucky to have these guys around to help expose us to the alternatives.
  At the events Ive been involved with over the past year there has always been this one group of very young kids (16/17) that decided to come out to one show, were sucked in and have loyaly attended every one of our shows since.  They would be the first ones there and the last ones to leave.  Arriving with nothing but a 24 pack of Lipton Iced Tea in cans danceing all night, and savoring every moment.  This alone has made all my efforts worth it.  Knowing that our events may have had a prolific impact on these few young high school students outlook and passion towards music.  They even showed up to the Bunker Records Tour which was at an 18 and over bar but there was no way I could turn them away to get them in despite.  Seeing things like this really help boost my drive to share what I love with other people.

  I think the responsibity for "re-diversification" and regaining the unity really lies in the hands of the promoters that do get the younger crowds on a regular basis and their willingness to not be limited by boundries and to work together.  Mix things up a bit through events that represent all aspects of electronic music and display the equal yet different qualities of each.

I love this list. There is more intelligent debate and talk about real
things then on any other list I've been on. I just spent 45 minutes reading
through all the material. I just have a few points to make.

One of the reasons the scene has changed is because the local and national
climate has changed. The law enforcement agencies are targeting our venues
and promoters. They really think that we all do hard drugs and that's the
only reason to listen to this music. This older generation is trying to
impose its views and values upon us. The youth of this country are being
corralled into the same consumer mentality and they don't have that "spark".
I think this blend of what I would call problems leads us to only have super
mega "popcorn" clubs and larger "profit focused" promoters. This in turn
becomes what the youth aspire to be and carries on to my next point.

When was the last time our country has seen it's youth work at a grassroots
level to accomplish goals for themselves and others around them? Having a
direct impact on someone else's life. Beyond serving them a burger and
ringing up there clothing purchase. This is a very special feeling I'm
sure. But I think this has become diluted. I think that in America you
don't receive respect or are told you are successful until you are making
big profits. The main society and culture in America is surrounded by
consumerism. Of course this boils over into our underground culture. There
are to many people trying to profit off of art. I'm not saying people
shouldn't be active. I just think they need to be active for the right
reasons and we lose site of that in this present climate.

I dont think this conversation is really about who is better and who is not etc.  And most people in on this topic are each contributeing something on their part beyond some posts on a message board.  And if people who go to events dont care who is playing then whats wrong with leaking something different in here and there and possibly grabbing the attention and broadening the musical tastes of even just a few people.

Oh yeah I should also give allot of credit to Ed Lunar for aideing in opening my eyes to what I have come to love.  His rooms were always my favorite.  When I went to Columbus events I didnt care who was headlineing as long as Lunar had a room somewhere.  I think one of the moments in my party history that had a big effect on me was at Get Freaky 2 in Springfeild when Ed was spining chillout tunes sitting down with the tables on top of some cinder blocks and a peice of plywood very low to the ground.   I ended up spending most of my night in that room in awe.

Thats what I meant to say, was mixing up parties, didn't go to Further Advances, myself, was in Pittsburgh that night for Refuse and Resist 2. They had Adam Jay and Shiva(who is back in Indy now), but there wasn't any of the bigger names he has been known to bring in in the past.  Relentless had Marco Carola, Shawn Rudiman and Titonton plus locals on the techno tip...  I think Randy went a little more mainstream with the lineup for Further Advances than he has in the past with Terry Mullan(and yes, he did show...) and Freaky Flow headlining, but it didn't work out.  No one was making money or even breaking even really around that time of the year down here with big parties, there was just too much goin' on and not enough kids to support it.  The only events that did well were the smaller ones.  Things have slowed down again down here, which is good.  It makes the kids appreciate it more, be more hungry for it, and that will definitely help the vibe of any party if theres that anticipation and excitement in your crowd.

Goldies in Akron will still do "raves".  Place is a bit small though.

Subject: {pb-cle} CAPITAL J THIS WEEK AT THE BBT FOR 2 BUCKS

Wed Nov, 20th 2002
DnB/Jungle Every Wed.
@ the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern!
---------------------------------------------
This week we are featuring a special Headliner guest someone that Pittsburgh 
has been
waiting for...Some one who is big enough hard enough and can rock the party 
like no one
else can.
(side note I've busted my mother fucking ass to get this guy so all you 
fucks better get offyour ass and show some love...Jesus christ im only 
charging 2 bucks for this cat.)


CAPITAL J: Phobic Records, Wikkid Records, Blaydrunner, 1groove.com, 
[Toronto Canada]
Capital J is one the most recognized DJs in the massive Toronto jungle 
scene. He has headlined parties all over North America and is the main 
resident for Next Junction.His show "Just Jungle" on 
http://1groove.com(Wednesday nights 12-4am Eastern)
recently became the most popular all drum and bass show in North America. He 
is known for his energetic performances,wicked scratching
and dancefloor smashing dubplates.Over the last six years Capital J has been 
sharpening up his jungle production skills
to match his chart topping Dust2Dust success. His first 12" release, on 
London's Phobic Records, sold 1000 units in less than two weeks.
Its not surprising that his follow up "Paranoid Chronic" was so well 
received by the UK's Knowledge Magazine. Keep a look out for upcoming hit 
tunes on Wikkid Records (Montreal), Phobic Records (London) Blaydrunner 
(Toronto), and of course...Dust2Dust.
With such a prolific portfolio already behind him, you can trust that his 
future releases
will only help spread Capital J's wikkid vibe far and wide!

Subject: {pb-cle} Passion and Focus

I've just a few things to add here...

We're seeing the emergence of subcultures within the subculture here, and
when you've done that I guess you've arrived. Of course, people are going to
get upset because you don't like techno or happy hardcore or whatever the
case may be, but what they're really unhappy about (in my opinion) is the
fact that they're losing their audience - why else would you be upset? The
"scene" has lost its focus, primarily because of its diversification, but
where you WILL find this passionate sort of focus is within specialty
events, because people there are sharing a purpose, whether it's black
turtlenecks and slacks or fuzzy glow-in-the-dark visors with blinking lights
(both of which I find rather distasteful, by the way).

Now you've got EDM shows in museums and in stadiums, and little burgeoning
subscenes that are all seeking to differentiate themselves from the others.
The point is that we are everywhere in different forms now, from the sleepy
villages to the bustling metropolises. We have taken over, and if you're
interested in furthering the computer as a tool for creating music, then
that should be good news to you.

In addition to that, many of you are concerned about law enforcement and
draconian legislature, but if every club in Amerika features a deejay
spinning EDM records, how will the "control freaks" single anybody out for
"oppression?"

Instead of worrying about losing passion, we should worry about losing
focus, and I mean that in an individual rather than a collective sense. If
you focus on what you are passionate about, then I think the rest will fall
into place. Many of you act as if your favorite genre is going to "go away"
or otherwise evaporate, but where do you think it is going to go? We are
experiencing a global revolution in music which will eventually become
completely pervasive, and I'd say that there is room for everybody. If
"techno" has as much of an audience today as "raves" had 12 years ago, it
should be very happy with itself. Think of what it will be in another 12
years when its current patrons have moved on to something more interesting.

Follow your passion.

J.[M]

Subject: {pb-cle} Pgh Things


Hello all well i guess i should start with introducing my self My name is 
Leandro Ferra.
Im and will be your host at FRICTION the new Saturday night at Peter's Pub.
It will be a weekly event, so this means you will have another reason why 
not to be frustrated with the lack of events here in Pittsburgh.
I have just recently signed to this board {iam also a member on lolli}.
I must admit you that im not inclined in posting & participating in any 
dramatic discussions about how bad the dance scene is in Pittsburgh.
Though it is a bit frustrating to hear day in and day out constant bitching 
about how that place is better than this place etc.
Im from England so yes i have been exposed to all the brilliant things you 
hear & read about.
  But it is not my place to compare what goes on in Europe to what goes on 
in Pittsburgh or Cleveland, it is irrelevant.
My Job is to support the thing which is near to my heart, and provide the 
best quality night with the talent that so graciously has been available to 
me.
  I thank my residents Jwan Allen,Shawn Rudiman, & DC Space{aka black mike, 
which also is my partner in my company} and all the Djs that have spun and 
will spin at FRICTION the next coming months.
With that in mind, This Saturday at FRICTION....
10pm-12am DC Space {deep house}
12am-2am Diplomat {deep progressive house}
                   &
Mr.. Anthony Fugate will give an extra spice for the night.

A special cover price if you are a lady and you where at FRICTION last 
Saturday and you got a get in for free flyer.
If you are a lady and you where not at FRICTION last Saturday you can get in 
for just $1.00, Guys get in for $3.00.

21+{id a must}
$1.50 domestic beers
Well I hope that all of this has been helpful in any way to anyone.
I hope to see you all there.

Regards,
L.

FYI for those interested...
Voigt-Kampff is actually comprised of two former members of Twilight Sleep.  They do produce some pretty dope stuff.  They have some audio up at http://www.zeropointrecords.com I believe.

Some people believe this to be true of Phish or N'Sync, but I disagree with
them as well.

The thing that absolutely kills me about techno is that its patrons are so
convinced that it is the zenith of all human creation that they are unable
to conceive other people not liking it.

We are all aware of the naked skeletal structure of 4/4 music, and it is
time to move on. The best thing techno could do for itself right now is to
reach into the influences of 19th century european orchestral symphony, and
allow the colors of strings and woodwinds to emrace the cold, hard matrix of
black and white on and off switches. If you absolutely must maintain the
position of bourgeois, at least integrate with other bourgeios ... otherwise
you will stagnate.

Stop techno inbreeding!

I agree.

I enjoyed myself at Peter's Pub last Saturday.

Its an intimate place with a generous dancefloor (with enough extra space to 
probably put in some more tables) - I would really like to see it fill up.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} More techno bashing

I like techno because I can hear a good DJ techno mixing it, working the 
faders
not just track after track beatmatched, but a whole creation, something 
I can also
see in booty house, chicago/detroit hard house, and drum and 
bass/turntablism,
hardcore etc.

I can dig trance, the club stuff and the pocorn stuff too, but I don't think
that a talented DJ-artist (one big hyphenated word here) can do the same 
things
with it.

it's gotta be skeletal and black and white for it to work

The whole point is creating warmth out of machines.. I dunno how many
times you have heard shawn, but it's always far from sterile.  Chords,
melody, even vocals (on the records).. not just off and on switches.  He
has grown and changed since the TR-Generation days, you should probably
check it out.

I don't particularly like ultra minimal techno, I'm a big
fan of melody, warmth, breakbeats, etc.  that being said, I wouldn't be so
emphatic about what shawn is doing if it werent true that people need to
hear it.  I'd only ask of you to give him 3 more hours of your ears before
you write it off! Is that so much?  I have done this before w/ members of
this list slagging on DNB.  how about now, can I mail you some cds of him
playing live at my night?

Yes.  The most AWESOME thing in my mind (aside from some crazy
performaances) about Land of the Lost (FESP, 2000) was that we had the
upstairs balcony at laga open.  All of the e-tards were up there, and
everyone else was downstairs, dancing.

That would be about as innovative as using the

Yes, but if one is truly a good DJ, it does not just require techno to 
create a set that can be looked at as whole creation.  A good mixer who 
knows how to select his tracks can create a whole piece regardless of the 
genre.  People give techno too much credit due to the tendency to support 
its underground roots and shun some of the more anthem, club-oriented stuff 
that you get with progressive, house, and even breaks.
But It's all about pushing your audience to outer limits and then bringing 
them back into the dancefloor, and a careful track selector can do this with 
any genre.  Anthems work, as long as they are just a part of the whole 
picture and not jast dropped one after another, in same way that black and 
white techno works, as long as its not one black and white techno track 
dropped after another.  I am not fighting for one genre over another, I'm 
just saying that a truly good DJ can accomplish the goal of a 2-hour 
creation (as opposed to just playing records) with any genre.  Minimal 
techno not required.  (but always welcomed).
Darren

As am I.  A good DJ doesn't just play other people's records.  He/She 
presents them to the audience in way they haven't been heard before in order 
to educate them, push a boundary or two, make them feel some emotion and, 
perhaps more importantly, make them dance.  it doesn't change whether one is 
spinning or performing original work live.  the goals of the performance are 
ultimately the same.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} More techno bashing

Each techno record is a snap shot of emotion.  A feeling.  To be able to put
these different pieces together and have them come off and "blow up" is so
much harder then lacing together anthem tracks.  It also requires more from
the listener.  Trust me, I used to lace together anthem tracks.  Its hard to
get your measurements on point and to make sure your melodies aren't
smashing together, but creation, that's something different.  It's fine if
people don't like techno.  But if you don't like it then relies that you
just don't get it.  No offense here its just the way it is.  I have a friend
flying into Detroit with me to see Richie and Sven play.  He's paying over
400 for his ticket to go.  He gets it.

there's nothing wrong with just playing records. i dont know why 
so many people are so demanding of people to "perform". some heads 
just know whats up with playing some good tunes and doing it in a 
way that moves and makes sense. selection is #1. a good song is 
always a good song. finding and playing a zillion good songs with 
transparent mixing is a good thing.

see, its the desire that some people have for 
constant "innovation" that just makes no sense to me. quality 
music must come first. someone playing weak tracks in a flashy 
manner is definitely inferior to someone playing strong songs in a 
smooth manner. people should pay more attention to quality on the 
dancefloor than the other shite that goes with it. "pushing 
boundaries" leads to things like current jungle and hard techno. 
yeah, lots of pushed boundaries there.

the idea of bourgeois music is white. look at jazz: it started in 
the poor and then when white people took it they made it 
bourgeois. techno is not white. the white techno isnt elite, its 
crap. people who like it are stupid.

no, they dont give a fuck about hearing good music. i have no

dont care. thats all it is. im not concerned with genres really. i 
spin in many many genres now that i can rock the 120-130 BPM

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} passion and lack there of

on the law enforcement tip:  if you have events with a small gathering, cops
leave you alone.  If your crowd is having a good time, but not being redneck
rowdy, cops leave you alone.  If you clear everything with the locals before
you do anything, cops leave you alone.  One of the most amazing things that
i remember from this last summer's cook da goose was that people there
(mainly i remember Lenny saying this) were amazed that in the urban area
that i was in i was able to keep the music up till very late in the morning.
All it took was me going around to the neighbors and telling them when the
party was gonna be, what to expect as well as tossing them an invitation.
People are less inclined to get pissed off if they are invited prior to day
of party.  some of my neighbors then planned on being out of town for the
weekend, but thanked me for the month notice.  The cops drove by a couple
times, but that's just routine patrol, and there was a party that was under
control (except for drunk cox and ridley setting off fireworks)... so they
dont fuck with it.  if it was a huge, overflowing party with people chucking
bottles into the street and people being redneck rowdy like ratana has a
tendency to do, then i could understand getting beef from the fuzz.  I'm
convinced that small and intimate crowds are the way to go in the future...
although i do also understand the constraints that it puts on bringing in
larger headliners, which i will leave up to the mega clubs...

with the events I have been involved in.  Yeah our crowds are considerably
smaller so Im sure thats a factor but I also think it helps that the more
mental genres out there have gained the respect of the arts community and
receive support from museums, universities, and publications.  Granted these
places arent exactly suited for a "party" atmosphere.

Are you sure that was at G-Spot? (in the boathouse next to U4ia on
Feb 14th '98?) I seem to recall him spinning that in Columbus at
Metamorphosis in the fall of '97.

That *was* incredible. That's my favorite non-rave track ever spun at
a rave.

The only reason I remember G-Spot so well was because it was PURE
HELL for me. A perfectly wonderful party that was ruined for me
because of a little trip to the hospital, getting very sick, and then
an underage kid freaking out on acid while under my watch (in that
order). Plus, it was my 21st birthday. Sucked.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} More techno bashing

Trevor Combee aka the Instigator needs to move back to Pgh.  That will clear 
up any questions or arguements regarding Pgh and Techno - end of story. 
(Plus Pgh needs a good kick in the ass that Trevor can provide)  Vinny and I 
were talking last night and we decided to start a 'moving back fund' to get 
Trevor's ass back up here from Atlanta.  Donations can be made at Club 
Havana and Pub IG.  Ha!

Go to Zythos and support Adam and Jwan in their next to the last Velvet 
Tuesday.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: saw this bumper sticker

I saw this bumper sticker today and immediately thought of Tom...

"Why be difficult, when with a bit of effort, you can be impossible?"

it's like i'm stereotyping one person based on some of their past comments.
It's never been that way between he and I, but i sit back and laugh at him
giving persons all they can handle to the point of frustration, which is
very entertaining for me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} passion

I know this hall in Strongsville (right outside cleveland), that is 
GREAT as far as venue size and such count's. I've been there for some 
formal things, and the main hall SEATS round 800 with BIGG ass hard 
wood dancefloor, and they have like 8 other smaller rooms. Now, i dunno 
if they do RAVES, or how much $$ (I wouldn't say its cheap), or even if 
theyd be avaialble, but... O also i think they might have a 2 AM close 
policy?  Muhaha, yah the BUT's just pile up,  but you never know what 
you can work out with them. If uve got money to dish on a big event and 
are interested, drop me a line and I'll find out the name/address, i 
cant remember exactly what its called.
Later,
Alex tweak

downtempo/breaks/jazzy type stuff on mondays that i just found out about.  
got there around 9:45ish and the dj was playing SICK downtempo hip hop/trip 
hop/jazzy breaky records that i wished i owned.  then a guy on bongos with a 
guy mainly just playing samples played some freaky jah stuff for a while, 
then it was ILL time... as in ill atmospherics... i wish i had known about 
these guys earlier... live drummer, mini moog, dj on 1's and 2's, bass 
synth, organ... i knew i was in the right place for music when titonton 
strolled in right before they started playing.  beautiful music.  just 
beautiful.  I think i'm gonna book em for cook da goose iii... there isnt a 
way that I can go wrong with them at any point in the day/night.  anyone 
know a way to get a hold of them (or their music?), i know that the 
drummer's name is don carlos and i've seen him in record stores before... 
i'm so happy to have found this happening in columbus.

So i went to 5:01 jazz bar cause i knew they did some 'electronic'
downtempo/breaks/jazzy type stuff on mondays that i just found out about.
got there around 9:45ish and the dj was playing SICK downtempo hip hop/trip
hop/jazzy breaky records that i wished i owned.  then a guy on bongos with a
guy mainly just playing samples played some freaky jah stuff for a while,
then it was ILL time... as in ill atmospherics... i wish i had known about
these guys earlier... live drummer, mini moog, dj on 1's and 2's, bass
synth, organ... i knew i was in the right place for music when titonton
strolled in right before they started playing.  beautiful music.  just
beautiful.  I think i'm gonna book em for cook da goose iii... there isnt a
way that I can go wrong with them at any point in the day/night.  anyone
know a way to get a hold of them (or their music?), i know that the
drummer's name is don carlos and i've seen him in record stores before...
i'm so happy to have found this happening in columbus.

Honestly, I really want to.  But money is actually
tight til I get paid on Friday cause I just finished
paying all my bills and my second security deposit.
Plus I don't go out on Tuesdays usually, cause i try to
get into work on Wednesday early...

I may go anyways.

But I am not just talking about lacing together anthem tracks.  As I 
previously stated, anthem tracks work, but only when used in conjuncture 
with other tracks.  No one ever said playing anthem after anthem is a good 
thing.  But I do have a pretty large bag of anthems and I also have a large 
bag of stripped down techno.  They each have their time and place.  I am 
just tired of the pretentious attitude that goes along with many people who 
claim to be into techno.  Just because it remains the most inaccessable type 
of edm doesn't mean it is better musically or "cooler" to play.  The 
challenge in spinning many different types of music is taking all these 
different types, (house, progressive, techno, breaks,) and making them sound 
good together when people wouldn't normally conceive the records sounding 
good together.  Any fool can take a bag of stripped down techno and mix 
record after record of the same style of production just as any fool can 
take anthem after anthem and lace them together. Do something different.


I have a friend
flying into Detroit with me to see Richie and Sven play.  He's paying over 
400 for his ticket to go.  He gets it.

No, that's just dumb. $400 bucks to see anyone (band, DJ, performer, 
sporting event) is just plain silly.  Maybe I'm just not as "hardcore" as 
you guys.

I totally agree.  I'm not talkign about performing in a juump around whoop 
up the crowd performing.  You're whole set is your performance, from your 
mixing (smooth or agressive) to your track selection to turntable ability 
(if any?).  Take the whole picture.  Your are standing in front of crowd who 
are there to enjoy themselves with the music and skills you are presenting 
them -- you are performing.

Innovation is just off-shoot of the natural human desire to create and move 
forward.  Innovation goes hand-in-hand with art.  Being stagnant in anyway 
gets you nowhere. (literally and figuratively)  And as far as current jungle 
and hard techo, i couldn't agree with you more.

  Yes.  The most AWESOME thing in my mind (aside from some crazy
  performaances) about Land of the Lost (FESP, 2000) was that we had the
  upstairs balcony at laga open.  All of the e-tards were up there, and
  everyone else was downstairs, dancing.

guess not.  I wouldn't say its hardcore or dumb.  He lives within his means.
If that means flying into Detroit for a night more power to him.  He works
hard and is very good at his chosen profession.  This isn't some 22 year old
kid rich from selling e-tabs.

To say that techno is stagnating is wrong,  There is so much music out there
that I classify as techno that isn't tracky or dubby.  The time of drumcode
and that style of Swedish techno is over.  But there is other stuff coming
out now from Sweden (scandium records among others) even that sounds great
and has melody and isn't tracky.  Just because you aren't exposed to it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Hell, one of the new ben simms 12" has
melody lines.  I could talk about what artists I think are cutting edge but
thats beyond the scope of this thread.

I think this steps back into the main topic that local promoters (with
exceptions) aren't providing any newer sounds or anything cutting edge.  But
to leave this with one last thing.  Isn't it great we all enjoy different
things?  I know I would be bored as hell if everybody enjoyed the exact same
things.

don't we all work hard at our professions? i know i do. To each his own, i 
suppose.  its not my $400.

I agree.  but just techno isn't the answer.  there's cutting edge in just 
about every genre, (granted, you have to look deeper into some than in 
others)and when talking about cutting edge, one can't solely focus on 
techno, because how cutting edge is that?


>But to leave this with one last thing.  Isn't it great we all enjoy 
> >different things?  I know I would be bored as hell if everybody >enjoyed 
>the exact same things.

This is exactly the point I'm trying to make.  It is pointless to argue over 
which genre is better, and that is not what i'm trying to do.  there are 
cutting edge producers in just about every facet of edm, and some who 
produce and produce well in just about every genre (Laurent Wolf & M. Kaiser 
being my favorite genre benders of the moment).  The buck doesn't stop with 
techno.  I like techno just as much as the next guy, which kind of makes 
this whole discusion a bit ironic.  In striving for divesity, pushing 
boundaries and cutting edge (whatever you want to call it) we ALL must 
sometimes look out over our current understanding of what is good music and 
what is pushing the boundaries, even techno-heads.  And don't just leave it 
to the producers to make a DJ set what it is.  The DJ has to do a little 
work too.  After all, DJs do get paid.  Earn it.

>word,
The pretentiouness that I'm talking about in the world of techno
comes from the techno-heads that consistently talk about cutting edge and 
pushing boundaries and how they are SOOOOOO into music and the musicality of 
it all, and then when they play out or pop a disc in their home CD, all it 
is is techno.  This what i mean when I talk about DJs who play it because 
its "cool" (SUPPOSEDLY the most innovate) now you may not be one, and i 
never accused you of the such, but they are out there.  i know more than 
few.  I am not bashing techno, you are just as likely to hear techno in one 
my sets as you are prog house or anything else for that matter, i am just 
challenge the techno advocates to look beyond their understandings of good 
music as well, for only all of would benefit from that.  And I can't agree 
with the love it or hate it, either.  I've been plenty bored to death at 
many techno performances.  I've been dancing my ass of at many as well. good 
music is good music and a good DJ is a good DJ.  Not JUST techno.

Man, if you think techno djs don't work or that techno producers make a dj's
sets...I just dont know what to say.  I guess we are just gonna have to
agree to disagree on this whole subject.

No, that's not what I meant.  There has just been all this talk going on 
about how you can do so much more with techno as a DJ because of its 
stripped-down nature.  And i'm saying that if a DJ has to put in a little 
extra effort to make something not as stripped down work (prog, breaks, 
etc..) then that's what you got to do.  Don't just say, "well, there's too 
much melody.  i'm moving to stripped down techno."

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} More techno bashing

{{ Andy James <mmf99@hotmail.com> }
I am just tired of the pretentious attitude that goes along with many people
who claim to be into techno.  Just because it remains the most inaccessable
type of edm doesn't mean it is better musically or "cooler" to play. }}

God bless the man like Andy James. I've enjoyed a few of Andy's sets, and
Hubajube, and a few others, and big T-1000 tore the roof off of this
shithole on Vine street.

I still find that to be the exception, however - not the rule.

{{ Thomas D. Cox, Jr. <death@andythepooh.com> }
techno = soulful machine music. it has a groove, funk, etc. }}

Machines have no soul. There is no groove, just a series of notches, and
this is about as funky as a metronome.

{{ Thomas D. Cox, Jr. <death@andythepooh.com> }
hardhouse + trance = white guy bullshit. }}

You'd be the expert on "white guy bullshit."

{{ ratana <ratana@chemlab.org> }
I don't particularly like ultra minimal techno, I'm a big fan of melody,
warmth, breakbeats, etc.  that being said, I wouldn't be so emphatic about
what shawn is doing if it werent true that people need to hear it. }}

Well, perhaps you're right. I try not to ever write anything off before I've
experienced it, even though I think "TR Generation" was extremely boring.

-

{{ ratana <ratana@chemlab.org> }
I'd only ask of you to give him 3 more hours of your ears before you write
it off! Is that so much? I have done this before w/ members of this list

at my night? }}

Yes, that's fine. E-mail me privately for info.

Which is the reason why I think there should be talk within the other cities
around all of us.
Being able to communicate and share each cities local djs, puts each others
scene in a better position for new things to come.

I really wouldnt mind seeing some action taking place man, seriously. I
think being able to jam out on a night with a wide variety of people, from
different area's is (excuse ma french) fucking awsome. I think there needs
to be a positive movement,.. thats really all there is to it. :)

i dont know any of these people. at least not in pgh. most of the

maybe "hard" techno is inaccessable, but real shit isnt. its damn 
near the easiest to digest, IMO. lots of melodies, generally an 
easy beat to dance to, etc. i think too many people have 
misconceptions about techno based on anectodal evidence.

i agree, but not with the "breaks" and "progressive" parts ; P

word, i was interpreting "performing" in the context you used it 
to mean that you should hear a deejay making the records do 
something that involves interaction between the two above and 
beyond a simple transitional beatmix.

good music is not stagnant. ask people who still listen to the 
beatles 30 years after they broke up. ask theo parrish or the 
people who spin @ body + soul who regularly drop old motown, early 
disco/garage, etc. look at people like metro area, who make some 
of the best music out now, yet theyre really not doing anything 
that hasnt been done before. of course you could balance them with 
recloose, whose shit sounds totally wild and new, but he obviously 
puts "making good music" ahead of "innovation". and thats the way 
it should be. if you can do both, awesome. but good is better than 
new, always.

what the hell are you talking about here? this sentence alone

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Shadow

I am always hesitant to pay more than $15 for a show. Sometimes it is 
warranted, but most times it is a waste of money. I think I am probably 
about to step on some toes here, but I am not going to apologize for it. I 
have a nasty taste in my mouth from the Shadow show. Granted, he is a vastly 
talented man with amazing turntable skills...and that sort of thing is 
always a pleasure to watch. I've seen plenty of very talented DJs however, 
and haven't had to pay 27 god damned dollars to do it. I was way more 
impressed watching Kevin Cunningham tearing it up at one of our house 
parties for free than I was watching Shadow in front of his 3 
superultramegastylin projection screens. Overall I think that he was 
condescending and elitist, which he may be entitled to, but not based on 
what he was doing last night. He acted as if the people watching him were a 
bunch of musically uneducated dim wits from the tight shiny shirt crowd. 
Unfortunately the crowd may have conveyed that message to some degree. 
Motherfuckers were cheering for anything that sounded vaguely familiar 
rather than due to the execution of the mix. I bet he could have garnered a 
round of "yippeeskippee" if he farted on the stupid 
microphone.........seriously, I think that.

J-Live wasn't able to make it, so we had Shadow and some opener whose name I 
can't recall. It was like D-Skills or D-Styles or something. I think that 
man rocked some sick mixes. Good beat juggling, good track selection, smooth 
flow. He brought some tasty hip hop selections to hype the crowd up, and I 
think he did a really good job. In fact, other than high-speed, 
crab-scratching, mixer tricks, he outperformed the illustrious DJ Shadow 
IMHO. I bet we could see him for $5 too. I sometimes laugh when Tom Cox gets 
going because he'll end his posts with a big "fuck you" to someone or 
something that a lot of people have a great deal of respect for. I think 
maybe I'll follow that lead.

Fuck Deejay Shadow

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Shadow

This is exactly why I didn't go.  As much as I wanted
to see shadow, $27 is just ridiculous.  Some of you
might say "if you really loved the music, the money
isn't what would be important"  and that's true, to
some degree.  I'm sure the production company had such
a high price because they didn't want to lose their
collective asses, but I knew a LOT of people who
decided not to go simply cause they price was not
right.  And I'm not about to contribute to the
inflation of DJ prices that we've seen for so long.
I know the prod. company was just trying to do a good
thing here and bring shadow out, but at the same time,
if you have to charge $27, then something is wrong with
how much he's asking for.  If I want to book a dj, and
he wanted too much, I'd explain to him that there ARE a
lot of people in Pittsburgh who want to see him, but
we're not a huge city where it's just throngs of people
who will pay most any price.  And if he decides that he
won't lower his price, then fuck him.  I'll get another
DJ.

um.. unless i am incorrect, i believe this was put on by joker
productions. not exactly a "production company" in rave terms. they do
mostly concerts, and have been for many years, and i am quite sure that
they didn't care about doing a good thing for anyone other than
themselves. that's how concert promotion companies work.

anyway... i was just saying that i don't think that love of this music or

You are correct Dori. www.jokerprod.com

Well...that's what I thought, but since I didn't know
about them, I was gonna give them the benefit of the

Which is another reason I didn't go.  There are very
few groups/artists I would pay more than $25 for.  Like
when I was a Freshman in college I bought 2 tickets to
the Y100 Fez-tival and I think the both of them
together were no more than $75, and we got to see a
shitton of bands (STP, No Doubt, Eve 6, Third Eye
Blind, etc) and my opinion that was worth it.  There
are a few people that I would pay big $ to see them
alone...Portishead....my uber-gods of Trip hop.  Give
me Portishead, Massive Attack, and the Sneaker Pimps in
once concert.  I would easily lay down $100 a ticket
(providing I could afford to).  But DJ Shadow isn't
worth $30.  I can buy a cd for that amount.

Look. Here is a perfect example of White Girl Bullshit{tm} (WGBS - similar 
to WGBS [White Guy Bullshit{tm}]).

First of all, all the *true heads* are black.

Are you black? Can you honestly say band camp is serious when the pigments 
of your skin do not reflect darker light?

You may think you are the real deal, the... RAW DIGGA... but you aren't. I 
don't care how much *METH* you produce, or how *EXPENSIVE* your breasts are. 
That sheepskin just don't fit, sister.

Second of all, unless it is the BBC (Black Band Camp{tm}), it is a waste of 
time, effort, money, gas, plasma, life force, and soul (or lack thereof, 
cracker).

How can *WHITE* people know anything about *BANDS* if they are *WHITE*?

This makes no sense to me.

You think you can play the oboe? Can you *HONESTLY* say that you can emulate 
the warm, fuzzy, soulful, intelligent, stripped down black & white sound of 
a black man playing an *OBOE*?

You are not equipped for these sort of opinions.

Subject: {pb-cle} My take on DJ Shadow (semi-review, semi-flame)

I'm gonna go in exactly the opposite direction from pangea. here and tell
you that this show was worth every penny.

1) I won't drop into "personal attack mode", even though I disagree with
every fiber of my being with pangea.
2) I'll give you reasons why I think the way I do.

pangea. wrote:
<<Granted, he is a vastly talented man with amazing turntable skills...and
that sort of thing is always a pleasure to watch.>>

OK. I'll give you that, and I'll go you one better. (Actually, I wish I knew
who you were so I could've introduced myself...I was there by my
lonseome...) I don't know how close you were to the action last night, but
what I saw and heard was nothing short of the single best DJ performance
I've ever seen.

He used: 2 turntables w/ a mixer and efx unit, 2 CDJ-100's w/ a mixer and
efx uint and an Akai MPC sampler w/ efx uint. Great, whatever, it's how you
use your tools...not always what you use.

And therein lies the rub...he took 2 hours worth of music that HE created,
and using those 5 separate instruments, completely deconstructed and
reconstructed those compositions live, for all to watch. And the fact that
he broke it down for the audience, explaining how, what, and why he was
doing it, made it that much more worthwhile.

I don't know how familiar you are with his music, but he combined vocals
from one song with drums from another and strings from a third. All from
separate sources, all in tune, and perhaps most importantly, it had depth,
feeling, and soul. It all combined to create a cohesive statement, which
makes him twice the artist of any other DJ I've ever seen.

<<I've seen plenty of very talented DJs however, and haven't had to pay 27
god damned dollars to do it.>>

I'm truly sorry you felt cheated, but IMHO, I've never seen a DJ do what he
did as successfully as he did it.  Which is, take compositions that I was
100% completely familiar with (some for up to 5 years), break them down into
their separate elements, and recombine them into a seamless creation that
was unique and new to me, the audience...and not just the average audience,
but an audience who HAS bootleg copies of his other shows, and has every CD
he's released and is familiar with everything back to "In/Flux" and
"Entropy" back in 1993...

THAT is the height of what DJ'ing can be.

<<...Shadow in front of his 3 superultramegastylin projection screens.
Overall I think that he was condescending and elitist, which he may be
entitled to, but not based on what he was doing last night. He acted as if
the people watching him were a bunch of musically uneducated dim wits from
the tight shiny shirt crowd.>>

OK, now you're starting to sound like a combination of jaded raver and just
plain old sour grapes.

At what point was he AT ALL condescending? I think he went out of his way to
get a (typical Pittsburgh) less-than-insanely-enthusiastic crowd emotionally
invested in what he was doing, going so far as to make some sort of verbal
interaction with the crowd (beyond just the typical "make some noise",
though he did that also).

If anything, he was all business when the music was playing, and humble as
can be when speaking. He, moreso than any other "Big Name DJ", has earned
the right to be, if not cocky, then at least self-aware of his talent, and
NONE of that came out in what he did or said last night.

And the screens rocked. End of story.

<<Unfortunately the crowd may have conveyed that message to some degree.
Motherfuckers were cheering for anything that sounded vaguely familiar
rather than due to the execution of the mix.>>

Perhaps because the execution of the mix was flawless at all times. I
watched, listened, squinted...If I didn't see it happening, I would've
believed that the whole thing was on DAT. (who knows, still might've been,
save some scratching, which was again, flawless).

I'm talking here about songs I've STUDIED to learn his style, and in my rapt
attention, even I missed a few subtle mixes...he'd go from CD to vinyl with
the same track at different points, and I didn't realize it until he was
back fiddling with the CDJ that had started the song...

<<It was like D-Skills or D-Styles or something. I think that man rocked
some sick mixes. Good beat juggling, good track selection, smooth
flow. He brought some tasty hip hop selections to hype the crowd up, and I
think he did a really good job.>>

Are you kidding??

That guy was ASS skills-wise...at one point near the end of his (mostly
mainstream top 40 radio friendly) pop-rap set, he dropped "Gin N Juice",
with the gain on his mixer turned so far up it sounded like he was playing
it on an Edison cylinder...no bass, and nothing but distorted hi's.

Who the fuck opens for DJ Shadow and drops a P. Diddy track? Fuck, I'm not a
turntablist, and _I_ could out mix that dude.

No, wait....I sincerely think Tom Cox at his drunkest, 1 hand tied behind
his back and DEAF could out-mix that guy.

Skills aside, you're comparing apples and oranges. Styles was mixing
records, 99% of the time without even BEATMATCHING, and with absolutely no
consideration to aesthetic principles. What Shadow did was a proper show. It
had all the ingredients...emotion, crescendo, style, form, and a sense of
arrangement.

<<In fact, other than high-speed, crab-scratching, mixer tricks, he
outperformed the illustrious DJ Shadow IMHO.>>

Look, just because Shadow didn't crossfade with his chin and drop Ludacris
and Rob Base's "It Takes Two" doesn't mean he 1) didn't rock shit, 2) wasn't
worth every penny of the admission price, and 3) isn't a damn fine
turntablist.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Shadow

Drake Steelz opened for shadow - he is a pittburgh local and used to play 
for us all the time at Hip Hop Tuesdays at Havana.  You can still see him 
around - look in the paper or access magazine.
Tickets were $23 at the door.
and well worth it in my opinion.
One of the best nights of entertainment I've had in this city in a while.  
The visuals were sick.  The midi capabilities (video and audio) that shadow 
and his visual guy had going on blew me away.  (maybe I'm uneducated in this 
realm but the guy in the back cueing the videos via a keyboard was pretty 
cool) The sync of the video to music, which had no lag and was split second 
with a high high fps rate was worth the price of admission to me.  (again 
I'm not saying I know everything about this so don't flame me for being 
ignorant)
I liked the fact that people were cheering and into his set.
I liked the fact that Shadow took the time to talk to Pittsburgh.  He seemed 
humble to me - giving shout outs to pgh and some local places such as 
Jerry's (which he spent time there record shopping before the show) I dunno 
- I got my money's worth - had fun with some great friends, got to hear some 
good music and drank a couple of beers.
$30 well spent.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Shadow


Drake Steelz opened for shadow - he is a pittburgh local and used to play
for us all the time at Hip Hop Tuesdays at Havana.  You can still see him
around - look in the paper or access magazine.
Tickets were $23 at the door.
and well worth it in my opinion.
One of the best nights of entertainment I've had in this city in a while.
The visuals were sick.  The midi capabilities (video and audio) that shadow
and his visual guy had going on blew me away.  (maybe I'm uneducated in this
realm but the guy in the back cueing the videos via a keyboard was pretty
cool) The sync of the video to music, which had no lag and was split second
with a high high fps rate was worth the price of admission to me.  (again
I'm not saying I know everything about this so don't flame me for being
ignorant)
I liked the fact that people were cheering and into his set.
I liked the fact that Shadow took the time to talk to Pittsburgh.  He seemed
humble to me - giving shout outs to pgh and some local places such as
Jerry's (which he spent time there record shopping before the show) I dunno
- I got my money's worth - had fun with some great friends, got to hear some
good music and drank a couple of beers.
$30 well spent.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} My take on DJ Shadow (semi-review, semi-flame)

<<thanks for stepping up ... I'm surprised no one else doesn't have anything
good to say about last nights show.>>

dammit...that means you were there too, and I didn't meet you either??
SHITBALLS....

My suspicion is that most people were of the "too much money/not worth it"
opinion, and weren't there. I saw one person I recognized last night. Out of
a crowd of easily 500...

Shit. Costs. Money. Folks.

It's a fucked up fact of life. People can't seem to grasp that. Too many
people 'round here seem to want shit handed to them for free. If other
people are willing to pay for it, and you're the only one who isn't, don't
wonder why more popular artists don't frequent our city.

If city A is going to make you money, and city B isn't, where are YOU going
to go?? Regardless of good intentions, the world IS and WILL CONTINUE to be
about the almighty dollar.

The fact that we have world-class talent like Shawn Rudiman just laying
around playing for free here and there IS THE EXCEPTION, NOT THE RULE.

It's fucking rave music, it's not "serious"

And it should never try to be, or you end up with post-96 DNB and minimal 
techno and garbage like that.

HELL YEAH

I'm looking forward to this.  Northeast Ohio has an unusual amount of

That was a very well worded and knowledgeable retort, Mark. You make a very

that he himself originally composed and produced. I think you're most likely 
right that some of my off the cuff statements were the product of a slightly

I'm gonna go in exactly the opposite direction from pangea. here and tell
you that this show was worth every penny.

1) I won't drop into "personal attack mode", even though I disagree with
every fiber of my being with pangea.
2) I'll give you reasons why I think the way I do.

pangea. wrote:
<<Granted, he is a vastly talented man with amazing turntable skills...and
that sort of thing is always a pleasure to watch.>>

OK. I'll give you that, and I'll go you one better. (Actually, I wish I knew
who you were so I could've introduced myself...I was there by my
lonseome...) I don't know how close you were to the action last night, but
what I saw and heard was nothing short of the single best DJ performance
I've ever seen.

He used: 2 turntables w/ a mixer and efx unit, 2 CDJ-100's w/ a mixer and
efx uint and an Akai MPC sampler w/ efx uint. Great, whatever, it's how you
use your tools...not always what you use.

And therein lies the rub...he took 2 hours worth of music that HE created,
and using those 5 separate instruments, completely deconstructed and
reconstructed those compositions live, for all to watch. And the fact that
he broke it down for the audience, explaining how, what, and why he was
doing it, made it that much more worthwhile.

I don't know how familiar you are with his music, but he combined vocals
from one song with drums from another and strings from a third. All from
separate sources, all in tune, and perhaps most importantly, it had depth,
feeling, and soul. It all combined to create a cohesive statement, which
makes him twice the artist of any other DJ I've ever seen.

<<I've seen plenty of very talented DJs however, and haven't had to pay 27
god damned dollars to do it.>>

I'm truly sorry you felt cheated, but IMHO, I've never seen a DJ do what he
did as successfully as he did it.  Which is, take compositions that I was
100% completely familiar with (some for up to 5 years), break them down into
their separate elements, and recombine them into a seamless creation that
was unique and new to me, the audience...and not just the average audience,
but an audience who HAS bootleg copies of his other shows, and has every CD
he's released and is familiar with everything back to "In/Flux" and
"Entropy" back in 1993...

THAT is the height of what DJ'ing can be.

<<...Shadow in front of his 3 superultramegastylin projection screens.
Overall I think that he was condescending and elitist, which he may be
entitled to, but not based on what he was doing last night. He acted as if
the people watching him were a bunch of musically uneducated dim wits from
the tight shiny shirt crowd.>>

OK, now you're starting to sound like a combination of jaded raver and just
plain old sour grapes.

At what point was he AT ALL condescending? I think he went out of his way to
get a (typical Pittsburgh) less-than-insanely-enthusiastic crowd emotionally
invested in what he was doing, going so far as to make some sort of verbal
interaction with the crowd (beyond just the typical "make some noise",
though he did that also).

If anything, he was all business when the music was playing, and humble as
can be when speaking. He, moreso than any other "Big Name DJ", has earned
the right to be, if not cocky, then at least self-aware of his talent, and
NONE of that came out in what he did or said last night.

And the screens rocked. End of story.

<<Unfortunately the crowd may have conveyed that message to some degree.
Motherfuckers were cheering for anything that sounded vaguely familiar
rather than due to the execution of the mix.>>

Perhaps because the execution of the mix was flawless at all times. I
watched, listened, squinted...If I didn't see it happening, I would've
believed that the whole thing was on DAT. (who knows, still might've been,
save some scratching, which was again, flawless).

I'm talking here about songs I've STUDIED to learn his style, and in my rapt
attention, even I missed a few subtle mixes...he'd go from CD to vinyl with
the same track at different points, and I didn't realize it until he was
back fiddling with the CDJ that had started the song...

<<It was like D-Skills or D-Styles or something. I think that man rocked
some sick mixes. Good beat juggling, good track selection, smooth
flow. He brought some tasty hip hop selections to hype the crowd up, and I
think he did a really good job.>>

Are you kidding??

That guy was ASS skills-wise...at one point near the end of his (mostly
mainstream top 40 radio friendly) pop-rap set, he dropped "Gin N Juice",
with the gain on his mixer turned so far up it sounded like he was playing
it on an Edison cylinder...no bass, and nothing but distorted hi's.

Who the fuck opens for DJ Shadow and drops a P. Diddy track? Fuck, I'm not a
turntablist, and _I_ could out mix that dude.

No, wait....I sincerely think Tom Cox at his drunkest, 1 hand tied behind
his back and DEAF could out-mix that guy.

Skills aside, you're comparing apples and oranges. Styles was mixing
records, 99% of the time without even BEATMATCHING, and with absolutely no
consideration to aesthetic principles. What Shadow did was a proper show. It
had all the ingredients...emotion, crescendo, style, form, and a sense of
arrangement.

<<In fact, other than high-speed, crab-scratching, mixer tricks, he
outperformed the illustrious DJ Shadow IMHO.>>

Look, just because Shadow didn't crossfade with his chin and drop Ludacris
and Rob Base's "It Takes Two" doesn't mean he 1) didn't rock shit, 2) wasn't
worth every penny of the admission price, and 3) isn't a damn fine
turntablist.

And that, right there folks, is what it's all about.

Release. Stereotypes.

Respect.  Others.

Open.  Minds.

Much props to you, to your opinion, and WE WILL have to meet and share a
drink. Well spoken.

im going to go ahead and disagree with you on the review of the 
quality of DJ shadow, as ive listened to his live sets, and i have 
a buttload of his shit, and its all quality. im sure he was just 
as quality again last night. the man's performaces are all pretty 
much flawless. but i have to agree about the money. $27 for a 
deejay is just ridiculous no matter what he's doing. at least if 
he's spinning at laga to a pgh crowd. ive seen great bands, 
classic performers, etc play for cheaper than that and their 
overheads are much much higher. i love shadow, ive bought so much 
of his music its ridiclous, but i dont feel the need to pad his 
pockets any more at that kind of rate.

>Shit. Costs. Money. Folks.

so let's breakdown the amount of loot needed here:

500 people @ an average of $25 per person = $12,500

i have no idea what laga and jon rinaldo take off of shows like 
this, but no matter what this is probably leaving at least $7500 
for a single person show on a tuesday night for a 1.5 (??) hour 
performance? thats $5000 per hour worth of music. on a tuesday. at 
LAGA. ew. 

>It's a fucked up fact of life. People can't seem to grasp that. 
Too many
>people 'round here seem to want shit handed to them for free. 

not free, reasonable. i saw 2 guys in Jazzanova deejaying in 
cleveland on a friday night to no more than 350 people for only 
$10, so i know im not just imagining this. if you went to a jungle 
event and paid $30, youd get at least 2-3 if not more individual 
deejays who are all from thousands of miles away in another 
country. the value of his performance isnt worth what was being 
chargred, no matter how good it was. shadow was one of my favorite 
musicians for a long time, and his "endtroducing" album has been 
one of my top 10 albums of all time since 1998 at least, and ive 
had it since i was in high school. 

>If other

well we do have some fucked up "entertainment" tax that has caused 
alot of performers to skip over us.

>If city A is going to make you money, and city B isn't, where are

yeah, but its not going to be about MY almighty dollar : ) 

>The fact that we have world-class talent like Shawn Rudiman just 
laying
>around playing for free here and there IS THE EXCEPTION, NOT THE 
RULE.

yeah but that doesnt mean that we should be gouged when paying for 
the out of town talent. when was the last time you made $7500 on a 
tuesday night in 1.5 hours?

see, you cant even recall my argument properly. i said 
that "opinion" is irrelevant to music being good or bad. music is 
OBJECTIVE. no amount of opinion can make good music bad, or bad 
music good. 

im going to start writing this book ive been thinking about

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} My take on DJ Shadow (semi-review, semi-flame)

if they pulled in 12,500 at the door...id say they probably spent 6....but
who knows what kind of arrangement they had with laga...laga might bet
getting some of that door too...anyways joker productions is obviously in it
for the money...if laga is gonna bring them the same ticket prices as a
mainstream band...they are obviously gonna charge the same prices....

my friend went to see rush at gund arena a few weeks ago...tickets were 50
bucks a crack...but well worth it...3 hours of the best studio rock band
ever...so by comparison...27bucks for one of the best turntablists of our
time for an hour and a half seems reasonable to me

joker has some deal setup with laga where i think he's the only 
person who does concerts there. plus the fact that laga gets the 
money off of drinks and whatnot makes me think that theyd pull in 
less off the door.

50 bills for 3 people playing twice as long (no matter how 
horrible they are, theyve spent more time onstage in their lives 
than shadow has beatdigging) vs. more than half that for one guy 
playing half as long? i mean obviously Rush will end up with more 
loot in the end, but all im concerned with in these situations is 
the personal economics. if people could charge $10 for their show 
and find a way to make $1 million per show, i would have no qualms 
with that.

<<i have no idea what laga and jon rinaldo take off of shows like this, but
no matter what this is probably leaving at least $7500 for a single person
show on a tuesday night for a 1.5 (??) hour performance? thats $5000 per
hour worth of music. on a tuesday. at LAGA. ew. >>

And of that $5000, Shadow had at LEAST 3 people on his payroll with him:
-Tour manager/roadie guy making sure shit was locked down, things were
working, etc.
-Visuals guy
-Sound man

I don't know exactly how the contracting of these people works, but for
someone to tour with you to be your employee, it can't be cheap...Now, you
figure for a world-class, professional sound guy, you're looking at at least
a $40G a year/tour. Visuals guy, who knows. Maybe $30G plus equipment
leasing. Tour manager, maybe 15-30% of your gross.

Plus travel expenses. It ain't like raves where you pay for DJ BigName's
flight and hotel...

<<not free, reasonable. i saw 2 guys in Jazzanova deejaying in cleveland on
a friday night to no more than 350 people for only $10, so i know im not
just imagining this.>>

And what or who did they bring with them? Two record crates...not much more.
We're talking about a singular artist staging his own national tour.

You may look at it as not much different, but it is. At least from a
business perspective.

<<well we do have some fucked up "entertainment" tax that has caused alot of
performers to skip over us.>>

If artists thought they stood to make a competitive pull, audience-wise,
versus another city, then the 5% they'd lose would be easily made up in
boosting of record sales in the area, etc.

<<yeah, but its not going to be about MY almighty dollar : )>>

And you then reserve no right to complain about not being able to spen your
almighty dollar on acts that don't show up to your town.

It's simple: supply and demand. There's no demand here, so they have no need
to supply.

<<when was the last time you made $7500 on a tuesday night in 1.5 hours?>>

When I have the talent of someone like that, a well-respected, very good
selling album, and people on my payroll, then I'll consider it.

Until then, I'll stay what I am, and not be ashamed of that--A student of
talented artists, developing my craft.

Last year's cook da goose lineup:

Ratana
Tom Cox
Boompsie
Mike Salamon
Lemma
Moose
Osmotic
Skillz

Free.  The difference between a concert promoter and a party promoter is
return on investment.  a party promoter usually tries to break even or make
a small profit.  a concert promoter tries to guarantee a profit.  it's
opportunity cost vs return that they look at when bringing in talent.  If
they can book a bigger name, they will attach a bigger price tag, so if it
bombs, they still will break even, but if it is a success, they make mad
loot.  Jazzanova isnt exactly a name that johnny-come-lately raver will
recognize, and isnt a huge name that a concert promoter wants to grab up
because there is fear of not making a profit.  a party promoter will pool
their resources to make sure that the word gets out to those who will
appreciate the sound they bring and they will estimate break even point and
set price accordingly (10 a head which is less than it costs to go bowling
nowadays)... I dont knock concert promoters for what they do, i just dont
support them unless it's something i absolutely have to see.  I do praise
and support party promoters who bring in good talent and set a fair price.
This is why i see a larger shift to club nights as the definative answer,
it's not about staying up all night long when you want to see good talent,
it's about paying a fair price and spreading it out over time.  Ratana did a
great job with providing 2 or 3 quality performers a week at velvet for
FREE.  Jason (havana), same thing FREE, FUZE $2 a week, revolve is a buck or
two, friction is 2 bucks, ... you can go out for 5 dollars for 5 nights and
see ~10-15 quality performers in pittsburgh in any given week.  Groove
provides good 'headliners' for 10-15 bucks a show, which is respectable and
indicative of the zelch brothers progressing their night as well as still
maintaining a fair price depending on how much they have to pay the
headliners.  You can always tell an 'in it for the money' promoter from the
'in it for the advancement of the community' promoter, and that's what it
boils down to.  Where is your money going?

well hey if he wants to pay people out of his cut, thats still his 
perrogative. the point is that any touring band (most of which 
arent charging NEARLY as much ....fuck, the TKK have been making 
industrial music for probably 15+ years at this point, they played 
the same venue the night before and with at least 4-5 people in 
the band alone their show was cheaper. i missed the show though, 
unfortunately.) is going to have expenses that go through the roof 
compared to this one man show.

im guessing those numbers are way off, unless he's getting gouged. 
which is entirely possible i guess.

was he using a bus or flying around?

a singular artist with a record crate and an MPC. whoopty dee, 
thats not much more to cart around. 

>You may look at it as not much different, but it is. At least 
from a

from a price gouging perspective. "hey, this is my national ARTIST 
tour, i can charge the same amount of money youd pay to buy my 2 
studio albums for 1.5 hours of a performance and i bet people will 
pay it!". 

>If artists thought they stood to make a competitive pull,

is it only 5%? i remember it being quite high a while ago, Tool 
were one of the bands that didnt come here for a long time because 
of it.

yeah i know how the music "business" works. and the "business" can 
continue to suck my dick. when music = business i quit caring. $27 
is business. i didnt go. if me refusing to be gouged by my 
favorite artists means that im not going to ever get to see them, 
thats fine by me. i mean, why would i care if they come here at 
all if they want $30 for me to see em? im not going to go! so they 
can just stay home and not make me irritated with their greedy 
asses. 

>When I have the talent of someone like that, a well-respected,

bah. the guy jacks samples from records youve never heard. it 
sounds good, but what the fuck. he's not worth $30. shit, i think 
the tickets for radiohead, beta band, and kid koala were about $30 
when i saw them in 2001. are you going to tell me that shadow's 
prices are fair when compared to that? 

>Until then, I'll stay what I am, and not be ashamed of that--A

waiting to make the big payday?

if someone ever said this to me about a show, i'd
 probably laugh very hard and then punch them.

sure i bought no doubt tickets for 35$ but the distillers were touring with
them!
and thats even less than a big ass rave.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} My take on DJ Shadow (semi-review, semi-flame)

tom are you insane?  a good engineer on tour could definately charge 40k for
the tour...even if he isnt rolling his own equipment...do you know how much
a good engineer makes an hour in a mastering studio in california? lets put
it this way...for an hour and a half in a mastering studio in cali...an
engineer proably makes between 750-1500 depending on who he is working
for...if you are mixing down a 7.1 movie mix you are making twice that...to
look at it from the engineers perspective...you have to make it worth his
while to leave sunny cali and his nice comfortable studio to go out on tour
and deal with that shit on the road...most engineers that ive talked to hate
being on tour...so they are gonna charge appropriately

now does shadow really need a road engineer...that is debateable til the
cows come home...im sure he wants one...he knows how much promoters are
charging for his show and im sure he wants it to sound as good as
possible...most soundmen dont know shit about making anything but rock sound
good...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} My take on DJ Shadow (semi-review, semi-flame)

<<waiting to make the big payday?>>

Tom, I really love your righteous, pious ass....

IF you could make loot like that for doing what you love, you KNOW you
would.

IF I thought I'd be able to make a viable living, support my family, and it
was going to cost you $23 to see me in concert, I wouldn't give it a second
thought.

You act like this guy is wearing gold chains, sipping Kristall out of a
diamond encrusted chalice. The mother fucker dresses like me. He acts like
me. He puts his baggy pants on the same way I do.

If you want to go back into history, he's been DJ'ing in some form or
another since 1984. Do you think in 1987 he was charging $20 a head to see
him spin EPMD and Big Daddy Kane? Nope. He paid his dues.

I respect the fact that you don't want to give up your hard earned money for
that. I GET THAT. I really do. There are lots of entertainment-options that
I don't choose to spend my money on. But don't tell me that the guy's got
some big plot to drain his audience of all their cash.

I'm sure he'd rather have packed the place and have people hanging off the
fucking rafters for $10 a head, than the mostly-full he got for $20. I'm
ABSO_FUCKING_LUTELY SURE of it.

But facts is facts:

If it was $30, you'd bitch cause you paid $20 to see a 5 piece band.
If it was $15, you'd bitch cause you paid $10 to see three other DJ's.
If it was $5, you'd bitch because you knew the nigga way back when, and you
should get in for free.

Face it, Tom. You just like to bitch.

thanks : )

family, and it

really? thats funny, id always pick giving my fans a break because 
without them my music career wouldnt mean shit. but hey, that 
makes sense so why do it?

>You act like this guy is wearing gold chains, sipping Kristall 
out of a

acts like
>me. He puts his baggy pants on the same way I do.

his bank account looks nothing like yours, and thats all that 
matters. i dont see why it makes no difference that he doesnt make 
a big deal about it. i mean, judging by the ticket price, he makes 
a big enough deal about it. 

>If you want to go back into history, he's been DJ'ing in some 
form or
>another since 1984. Do you think in 1987 he was charging $20 a 
head to see
>him spin EPMD and Big Daddy Kane? Nope. He paid his dues.

is any hiphop deejay worth $30? how much was jazzy jeff? on a 
friday night? i mean, there's no contest, jazzy jeff was wrecking 
shit while shadow was crawling around on the ground. jazzy jeff 
has also produced some really tight shit for people who have sold 
buttloads more than shadow. 

>I respect the fact that you don't want to give up your hard

options that

guy's got
>some big plot to drain his audience of all their cash.

what else is there? i can come up with only a few deejays who are 
charging around the same rates for their shows and those peoples 
names are OAKENFOLD SASHA DIGWEED. i mean, the executioners have 
played here multiple times, each time was much much cheaper, 
theres more of them and they have been doing it just as long. 

>I'm sure he'd rather have packed the place and have people 
hanging off the
>fucking rafters for $10 a head, than the mostly-full he got for 
$20. I'm
>ABSO_FUCKING_LUTELY SURE of it.

then why didnt he? im confused. greed?

>But facts is facts:
>
>If it was $30, you'd bitch cause you paid $20 to see a 5 piece 
band.
>If it was $15, you'd bitch cause you paid $10 to see three other 
DJ's.
>If it was $5, you'd bitch because you knew the nigga way back 
when, and you
>should get in for free.

i always get in for free : P 

and yeah i like to compare the experiences ive had with what other 
people are charging. once you know what your money can buy you, 
when someone rolls into town with that kind of price tag you can 
smell the bullshit all the way from cleveland. 

>Face it, Tom. You just like to bitch.

yeah that too, but i really like to bitch when i find out one of 
my former heros is a greedy fucker.

Thursdays at Havana

   This has been going around for about a year and I think this is about the fifth time this has been posted to this list.  I funny thing is the guy who wrote and posted it is a big "electroCASH" freak.
  In case you are still so nieve that you think "electroCASH" is a genre of music please know that "electroclash" is a music festival and Larry Tee owns the rights to the name.  I dont really want to get into this conversation again but there are so many people out there who think they know that must be schooled.  Electro is electro is electro (although there are more styles of electro than I can count on my hand).  I will admit though there is a big line between the real shit and the crap being sprouted out of this so called "electroCASH" movement.  So please people dont assume you know so much just cause you read some silly webpage or some fashion magazines.  Misinformation sure is a bitch.  If you want schooled on some real "dirty electro disco robot funk" then be at bump on Friday and see me spread my electro goo full of test pressings and pressings of my own tracks.
"You can all burn in your "electroCASH" hell!"

Pretty good machine but yeah Trout is right might as well get the full thing.  The biggest advantage would be its size and the fact that its battery operated might come in handy too.  It makes a decent little portable midi controller too.  The arpegiator on it is pretty good and the vocoder sounds nice but you can get all that with more power with the MS2000 for just about 200-300 more.

get that instead is my instinct.

unless you need the keys.

Here's something that's good!!!
"Doug E Fresh has joined LL Cool J as the first authors of 'Hip Kid Hop', a new children's series from Scholastic Books. Each 32 page book comes with a CD featuring the artist rapping his story and an instrumental track so that kids can read and rap along." 
other artists include Prince Paul, Common and Shaggy

It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs
So won't you move your butt

just set up a table for me to sit at with a "requests for the 
deejay here" sign above it. give me free drinks all night and ill 
be happy to tell all those guys whats up. 

remember folks, my talents are not just for use on this list. if 
you need some form of argumentative entertainment and you plan on 
compensating me for it, its on. i also do searches at the door of 
raves for drugs, and i actually search people and take their drugs 
and throw em in the garbage. and then i clown on them. that kinda 
shit will cost you though.

This is absurd but ok.  I wont lie and say Im super old school and have been "spinning" records for more than about 4 years.  I was never really into spinning for a long time but I was into collecting old records.  Finally it got the the point where I felt since I have all these records I may as well start spinning.  Then I got into it.  The point of my post wasnt wether I was "old school" or not.  It was that the link you posted is becomeing redundant and that there is allot more going on in modern electro than what people read about in fashion magazines.  No hard feelings.  I didnt intend for this to be come a "more old school than thou" contest.  Im sure you know your shit.

I dont really want to get into this conversation again but there are so many people out there who think they know that must be schooled.  Electro is electro is electro (although there are more styles of electro than I can count on my hand).  I will admit though there is a big line between the real shit and the crap being sprouted out of this so called "electroCASH" movement.  So please people dont assume you know so much just cause you read some silly webpage or some fashion magazines.  Misinformation sure is a bitch.  If you want schooled on some real "dirty electro disco robot funk" then be at bump on Friday and see me spread my electro goo full of test pressings and pressings of my own tracks.

It's a sad and well known fact that most people don't

would rather live in their happy ignorant lives than to
try and improve themselves.  I'm generally a nice
person, so long as you don't get on my bad side.  And

Mythodic Productions and Mekka Nightclub are proud to bring you a very
special event
Saturday February 15th 2003
Here is your chance to catch a very rare performanceAll the way from Japan
we bring you
Satoshi Tomiie
Saw Recordings/Nubreed/Global Underground/Japan
Playing a special 4 hr set. (So get there early)

Satoshi's music career began at an early age when his parents encouraged him
to study the
piano. He trained for an admirable ten years, developing a distinct passion
for jazz. In school
he played in various bands. Soon after, the sound of Hip Hop provoked him to
not only form his
own band but also to start his foray into DJ'ing and production. Then came
house, as he became
fascinated by the early Chicago mix-tapes he was hearing.
A Japanese cosmetic company asked Satoshi to produce a track for their
forthcoming promo
parties where legendary DJ Frankie Knuckles was performing. Knuckles saw the
potential in
Satoshi's music and asked if he was interested in collaborating. The final
result of their
partnership was "Tears", a defining moment in vocal house and a song now
commonly regarded
as an all time classic. Satoshi soon took the leap and moved to New York.
Since his seminal hit
"Tears" with Frankie Knuckles back in 1989, he has gone on to become a major
part of the
acclaimed Def Mix crew. Tomiie has remixed and worked with the likes of
Photek, Kosheen,
Simply Red, David Bowie, U2, Mariah Carey, Misia (Japan's #1 R&B artist),
just to name a
few.
In 2000 Satoshi wrote and produced his debut album for Sony entitled "Full
Lick" featuring
performances by Kelli Ali, former front woman for the Sneaker Pimps, Diane
Charlemagne,
Robert Owens and others. The album has been met with critical acclaim by his
fans and the
press with each single enjoying top ten dance chart success. "Up in Flames",
one of the singles
from the album, included mixes from John Digweed and became a number one
dance hit in the
UK. It is also featured on a number of mix cd's including Global Underground
mixed by Steve
Lawler. In the US, "Up in Flames" and "Darkness" established Satoshi's
presence in the
alternative music scene as well as the dance music scene. The Global
Underground compilation
mixed by John Digweed also featured "Love in Traffic" the most recognizable
single from "Full
Lick" in addition to three other "Satoshi" productions/ remixes.
In 2001, Satoshi Tomiie launched his own label "SAW.RECORDINGS". It was
Satoshi's desire to
create a platform from which he would be able to showcase ideas and
creativity that are more
experimental and underground. His first single entitled "Paranoize" by
Bipath has caused major
excitement from DJ's worldwide. Follow up singles, Madam "Penetration" and
Tomiie's "Virus"
gave SAW world recognition.
2002 will bring forth singles and EP's from the likes of Akadoma, Jerry
Bonham and Tigerhook
as well as other forward thinking collaborations from Tomiie and his label.
His ongoing philosophy to push the envelope and expose new talents has
assisted in the launch of
such new talents as Trendroids, Lexicon Avenue.
SAW.RECORDINGS is an example of the direction that Satoshi is heading in,
acknowledging the
changes in the dance music scene, thus shifting what House music is. House
music never stops
evolving and expanding its borders and Satoshi Tomiie is in the forefront of
this movement.

i didnt mean for that either...i didn't know anyone posted it...it was the first time i saw it and i thought it was hilarious. i thought you were all defending the likes of Tiga and those jack-asses...just bustin some balls.

FUNCTION
NOV. 29, 2002
346 South High St.  Columbus, OH
$5

============

Magnetic Bass Crew and All City Beats Present FUNCTION on November 29,
2002. Work off all that turkey with a night of dancing to some of the best
drum 'n' bass, breaks and house you've ever heard for only $5!!

::Upstairs::

MATHEMATICS (Defunked/Hospital/Renegade, NYC) **Special 2 Hour set!!**

This Brooklyn-based trio is at the forefront of the drum 'n' bass scene
right now and they continue to gain recognition throughout the world.
Their innovative and more dance floor oriented drum 'n' bass is a
culmination of years spent listening to classic hip hop, deep house,
breakbeat, dub reggae and Detroit techno. Don't miss their first
appearance in Columbus and the two-hour set that might even help your
calculus grade!

Titonton (Commercial Suicide/Broken Beats, Columbus)

This local legend should need no introduction, but for those who arent in
the know, Titonton has performed across much of the US, Canada and even
throughout Europe. As a producer, he has had his techno and drum n bass
tracks released on labels all over the world and even landed a few
mentions in publications such as URB and A Rough Guide to Techno. We told
him to surprise us with this set.

Katherine Paisley (Louisville, KY)

"My goal when I play out is to play records that make people want to
dance." Expect to hear some sexy San Francisco-style house that will
satisfy your tastes for tribal, jazzy and techy grooviness.

::Downstairs::

Konkey Dong
Khaki
Hawstyle
Shapeshifter

+ more TBA


Doors open 10pm

This event is scheduled to go until 3am, but if the party is jumpin we'll
go until 5 or 6am, which means more DJs!

Infoline: 614-291-0210 (All City Beats)

[check the infoline for updates or look on http://www.bluelight.nu
(midwest events --> Ohio) for the latest buzz]

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Thu Nov 21            SYMBIOSIS: Live Art/Music Auction     Antioch College

"Symbiosis: Live Art/Music Auction"
Thursday, November 21st - 6pm until 2am
Birch Space @ Antioch College - 450 Corry St, Yellow Springs, Oh 45387

Symbiosis, defined in biological terms, is a mutually beneficial
relationship that exists between two or more organisms living in close
proximity or contact. You are cordially invited to witness as both
students and faculty from Antioch College create their own manifestations
of symbiosis in artistic terms - a stunning interaction between art and
music. The art and music are performances themselves, the spontaneous
creation of various mediums of art simultaneous to both live and DJ
musical performances encompassing a broad range of music.

At the end of each performance, an auction will be held that provides the
rare opportunity for the audience to acquire both the original art and
recordings of the music that was just experienced. All proceeds will
directly benefit the Performing Arts Committee at Antioch College.

Of Art:
Professor Chris Garcia (ceramics & sculpture)
Ally Adduci (oils)
Sara Duda (acrylics)
Erin Ford (ceramics)
Bryan Heidel (4-D mixed media)
Daniel Marks (sculpture)
Kyle McCann (ceramics)
the Antioch Media Collective (film and video)

Of Music:
the Beast (bluegrass)
Dr. Falafel w/ Method Moyle (breaks/hiphop dj w/ mc)
erth (live psychedelic trance)
Mo Mizuho (violin & voice)
Prodjeckd Grande Omega Minus (glitch/idm)
the Quartet (post-rock)
Reverberber (glitch/idm)
Will Robinson (live groovy breakbeats)

This event is open to the entire community. Entrance is free of charge.
Please be aware that access to the Antioch campus is restricted to the
Birch Space. Wandering, loitering, and any form of disrespect will not be
tolerated. Positive interactions and bidding on the auctions will be
encouraged.

Please contact daniel at 937.769.1027 during business hours for additional
information or email at dmarks@antioch-college.edu. MapQuest supplies
comprehensive directions. The Birch Space is located 1/4 mile south of the
intersection of 68/Xenia and Corry St on the right. The Birch Space is the
ground floor section below the dormitories.

Bio:
Steve Lawler is a definitive DJ and producer: a tastemaker whose sets 
combine quality house music with the power to move dance floors around the 
world. In the last few years, he's ignited crowds in the worlds best clubs 
such as Zouk in Singapore, Space in Miami, Twilo in New York, Pacha in 
Buenas aires and the mighty Space in Ibiza. Courtesy of home in the summer 
of 1999 and 2000, he provided the groundbreaking sets of the season for 
many of those lucky enough to hear him. Just after the first two months he 
had been crowned 'King Of Space' by the locals - a rare and well deserved 
honor. For over a year, Lawler set the capital alight with his weekly 
Friday night residency at Deepsouth at home. I f you were lucky enough to 
catch one of his 6 hour sets, you'll know exactly what it felt like as he 
weaved his magic across the club's sound system, wowing clubbers and 
critics alike. In Febuary2001, Steve decided to finish his stint at home 
due to overwhelming demand for his skills across the UK, and farther a 
field to the USA and the rest of Europe.

Full Bio for Fabio & Grooverider
>From playing pirate radio to residing at Britain's most exciting and 
ground breaking clubs, Fabio & Grooverider have forged a path that has 
shaped the sound of drum 'n' bass and been vital in establishing the 
house, techno and early breakbeat scenes in the UK. The duo first hooked 
up in early 1987 at Phase One, a pirate radio station which also featured 
the likes of Colin Dale and David Angel. An instant rapport was 
established as Fabio dropped funk and soul numbers over Grooverider's hip 
hop beats. With acid house, they started DJing together at Mendoza's - an 
after hours haunt in Brixton full of the Shoom crowd. Quickly establishing 
a name for themselves, they began playing all the major raves, spinning a 
mixture of Detroit house and early rave. Fabio & Grooverider have always 
been a couple of steps ahead of their contemporaries, laying down early 
European techno way back in 1989, and developing the first UK breakbeat as 
long ago as 1991 at seminal club night Rage. They've also played 
extensively on the rave and house circuits for years, both together and 
separately.

Sat Nov 30                    ROCK THE BELLS 2                       Dayton

Wishing Well and Groovefuel Recordings, on Saturday November 30th, bring 
you.......

"Rock the Bells 2, The Second Ringing" featuring the following djs and/or 
acts........


Donald_Glaude ( Moonshine Records, Eden Records ) Los Angeles, California
A veteran DJ for over 15 years, Donald Glaude has cemented his reputation 
as a crowd-rocking favorite and one of the most in demand artists in the 
country. He is one of those rare DJs who perceives their role to be that 
of an all-around entertainer and performer. He exudes energy, dropping 
track after funky track, arms aloft, and has been known to join the 
dancers on the floor. Join us at Rock the Bells 2 to witness the man DJ 
Dan considers "one of the most entertaining DJs in America to watch live." 
__________________________________________________

Huge Surprise Orlando Breaks dj to be announced seconds before he takes 
stage. This guy has accomplished many things in the breaks world and 
people all over are playing his records. His blend of progressive and 
funky breaks will leave you in awe and wanting more, he flat out rocks the 
decks, and has done it in Dayton before.
__________________________________________________

UF0_! ( Phunkatech Records, Phylum Recordings, Circa ) New York City
Featured in magazines such as URB, XLR8R, Lotus, Mixmag, Knowledge, and 
many other 'zines, UFO! is one of the most sought after producers in the 
United States. Record labels across the country clamor for a UFO! remix, 
which guarantees a dance floor hit. A Bay Area native, UFO! pioneered the 
San Francisco Drum and Bass scene and co-founded the much respected 
Phunckateck collective, creating a new community in music. Now residing in 
New York City he is rocking more crowds then ever.
__________________________________________________

Charly ( Bassdrive, Well Known Djs ) Philadelphia
Spinning around the East Coast over the past few years has gained Charly 
the reputation for clean sets, crazy mixes, and an incredible vibe behind 
the decks. Headlining around the country with UFO!, Juan Atkins, DJ Seen, 
and AK1200, has earned, as well as provided, Charly immense respect. Once 
Charly is seen in action, it's easily understood why she has been touted 
to be the next best thing for the US Drum-n-Bass Scene. At the young age 
of only 18 she is sure to be the next superstar in drum and bass.
__________________________________________________

Trevor_Lamont ( NateFx, Soulbrothaz, Aliensquad ) Lexington KY
Trevor is one of the most respected and skilled DJs in the Midwest and is 
never to be missed as you might miss something spectacular. His experience 
reflects on his sets as he can always work the crowd with his soulful 
house music and break it down to its roots.vs.Samm-e ( Soulbrothaz, U.S. 
Hispanix, House Purists, Dr. Sun Prod, Senor MTSU ) Murfreesboro
Samm-e is one third of the nationally acclaimed Teamsters crew consisting 
of him, Halo, and Trevor Lamont. When he hits the decks there is a vibe 
that comes over the room and with him on two while T is on two, things 
could get crazy, and memorable.
__________________________________________________

Guy_Smilee ( www.gagproductions.com, www.neutralmusic.net ) Rochester, New 
York
Guy Smilee is one of the most popular happy hardcore djs in the US and 
with Jumper by his side they always bring the house down. Guy can scratch 
with about any part of his body, and make sure you watch on November 30th 
as you can see him in action. Like I said Jumper will be by his side and 
you all know he can rock it and let's show him how much we love him in 
Ohio. w/ Mc_Jumper ( GAG, Ruffneck Playaz Crew, www.neutralmusic.net ) 
Rochester, New York
__________________________________________________

Big Regional Surprise Act to close out the main room and rock it for an 
hour. These guys have been ripping it for a year now and have been ripping 
it all together for about 2 years. They made their debut last year on 
December 15th and will be closing out the main room at 5 with a set to be 
remembered for a lifetime.
__________________________________________________

Kid Chaos ( In the Groove, Infinity Prod )
This house music enthusiast is always a hit on the dancefloor. His fusion 
of disco house and groovy tech-house has helped him gain recognition 
throughout the midwest and get him on lineups with names such as Too 
Short, Sandra Collins, and more.
__________________________________________________

HE10 ( In The Groove ) Tucson, Arizona
Coming to us all the way from Tucson he is ready to throw down the dopest 
uplifting trance we have seen in a long time. The awesome track selection 
and flawless mixing will bring him back to our city more often, hopefully.
__________________________________________________

Mike_Donovan ( Bounce Theory, Scarab Records ) Dayton, Ohio
Mike is co-founder of the Bounce Theory in Dayton Ohio. Deep tech-house 
music for the sophisticated listener featuring smooth, deep, jazzy 
grooves. He will be promoting his new cd Paint the Town Redd so be close 
to the decks and you might get a copy.
__________________________________________________

Chromix_live pa ( Groovefuel Recordings, Do:Loop Records ) Cleveland
This Northern Ohio progressive and hard trance producing phenomenon has 
been writing tracks since the age of 15. His unique and powerful live set 
will leave you begging for more and make sure you watch out for his first 
release on Groovefuel Recordings later this year.
__________________________________________________

Matthew_Kelly ( 4-Score Productions, Katatonic Resident ) Nashville
This crazy scratching breaks master representing Nashville will make his 
first Wishing Well appearance and a long awaited one at that. Make sure to 
catch his set as his whole crew including Michelle make it up from 
Nashvegas.
__________________________________________________

Clay-Born ( Wishing Well, Breakline Crew ) Louisville
Clay is always bringing a new crate of records and a totally awesome 
performance to every event which keeps his sets fresh and new and the vibe 
totally flowing to the deep basslines and dirty beats that make up 
nu-skool breaks.
__________________________________________________

Foursqare ( Wishing Well, Metronomix ) Louisville
Last year around this time a dj was born to the scene to show everyone how 
to rock it, Foursqare style. The dope ass house sets she drops are enough 
to make people like Paul Johnson and other house legends say WHOA!!! 
__________________________________________________

e21 ( :SCENE:, Stellar Gruve ) Atlanta
The man behind SCENE Ohio made his first Wishing Well debut at the last 
Rock the Bells and rocking it this year will be no different. The trance 
selections he brings to the table are amazing and his attitude towards the 
music and his presence on stage show it all.
__________________________________________________

Nero_X ( Hypnotik Therapy ) Cincinnati
You thought you wouldn't hear the techno but what party is a party without 
techno. Get there early to hear this man bring it hard. Dino is an up and 
coming superstar in the Ohio scene so look out for him whenever you can.
__________________________________________________

Jigglypuff ( Independent ) Cincinnati
If you thought Guy Smilee was enough happy hardcore for the night you were 
totally mistaken because this guy will bring it in early to set the vibe 
and the night off on the right foot. Let the man we call Chester know how 
much we love him and be right next to the decks when he throws down.
__________________________________________________

Def_Leper ( Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids ) Dayton
What can I say? Sliced bread had a good, long run but now this is the best 
thing to hit the scene. If you miss this set you should be shot with many 
Fruit Pebbles until your bum is sore. The 80's pop and hardcore mixture 
will have you dancing on tables and screaming at the top of your lungs.

***WINTER WONDERLAND 2***

DDR - London, United Kingdom (LIVE PA) - www.damndjs.com - Techno/Acid 
Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well 
as Stay Up Forever, Cluster and Choci's Chewns.  Whether you like trance 
house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno

in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic

that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002

GlassCity Records Presents:
*Arrival*
Monday, December 23rd 2002
Toledo, Ohio
Robert Armani - Chicago - Techno - High Octane

When you put the words "Chicago" and "Techno" together one man comes to
mind, Robert Armani! The south side "Crown Royal Funksta" has been a
techno staple for the last decade and his discography puts him in a league
all his own. On his first trip to spin in Italy he realized his true
calling while studying to be a Chicago Police officer (we almost lost
him). Just the mention of "Blow It Out", "Burn Out", "Big Dick", "Playing
With a Rubber Band", "Ambulance", and, of course, "Circus Bells", brings
back memories of dancing to them over the past ten years at rave parties
and in clubs all around the world. Dance Mania, ACV, Dust Traxx,
Djax-Up-Beats, and High Octane are the labels where his music has been
released and his remixes of JB3 (Joey Beltram), Paul Johnson, Dave Clarke,
Blake Baxter, Armando, and even Gary Numan have elevated him to the
highest of heights. With sixteen full length album releases and over sixty
single releases it has been hard to avoid Mr. Armani's work while flippin'
through any techno bin. His relentless tour schedule has him on the road
non-stop and his hard hitting, dirty, Chicago Techno has rocked clubs
since his early days of spinning. This is a man of Techno royalty and we
are happy to live under his reign.

Translucent - Chicago - House/Techno - Transparent, DTX 

Translucent, also known as Jason Torres, has been playing and studying
music for over sixteen years. Having been influenced by jazz artists such
as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Charlie Parker, Jason started playing
the trumpet and piano at a young age. His dedication to music earned him a
full jazz scholarship to the prestigious Roosevelt University in Chicago
where, in 1994, he was influenced by another style of music known as House
Music. Jason then began DJing and started something new and fresh in the
dance community: playing live trumpet while spinning records, combining
the elements of live jazz with electronic music. Noticing that Jason had
something special, Paul Johnson, the creator of the gold record "Get, Get
Down," helped Jason create connections in Chicago. Since then, Translucent
has played live trumpet with such greats as Derrick Carter, Timo Maas,
Mark Farina, Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr., Glenn Underground,
Cajmere, Boo Williams, Carlos, and Halo. Recent recording projects include
Glenn Underground's new album on Guidance, work with Derrick Carter on
classic, and Gene Farris on Fluential.

To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.

All I can envision at this moment is a ghetto-ized version of that Monty

<<i also do searches at the door of raves for drugs, and i actually search
people and take their drugs and throw em in the garbage. and then i clown on

I think it would be funny as hell to throw them into one of those 55 gallon
drum hobo-heater fires....just have the thing raging, and when you find a
bag of anything (other than weed, of course, cause really, that would just
be sad)....toss that shit in there RIGHT IN FRONT of the former owner.

If you're REALLY lucky, they'll be so distraught they'll stick their heads
in the fire just to not waste all of their "stuff"....

Yeah, perhaps I went a bit overboard there. Drake Styles was good....not
what you'd expect as an opener of a DJ Shadow, but he was really a
last-minute sub, so under the circumstances, he was more than adequate.

That was a great song...

Shania's not bad for that either.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} why can't all new jungle be this good? 

This song is pretty tight...
Good samples, good synths, I think the rhythm track is a little too "tinny"
but there should be a few remixes about that will "thicken up" the sound.

think - whether it would be worth it or not - will we get a crowd or will 
everyone be tied up visiting with families?

Jason C.

412 661 2025

Upcoming Havana DJs:

12.12  DC Space and James Neil
01.02  Vinny and DC Space
01.09  Kaleo and Disco Dan

************************************************
If you wish to never hear from Club Havana again, please reply politely and 
your name will be expeditiously removed from our rolls.  Thank you.

Hey, Lenny said it was OK to light them off, lol.  Actually he just said, 
"why not?".  I was quite torqued at the time and it seemed like a good idea. 
  I felt really bad after the people sleeping upstairs woke up from them.  
Then again, thats there fault for sleeping.

Just an added note, that college area down there is nice.  I'm gonna 
deffinately check Columbus for grad school when the time comes.

Subject: {pb-cle} LIFE SUPPORT DNB this weekend: 

SATURDAY, November 23

Life Support this weekend will be featuring:

BINAC
Of Bulletproof fame and now part of the near legendary Weapon team
(Dieselboy, Sine, Kaos, Binac) which has remixed Tech Itch's slamming
"Reborn" as well as making other tunes being caned on plate, Nick is sure
to smash it down for you tonight with plenty of dubs and tunes to get you
calling for the R-E-W-I-N-D!

CUTUPS
A supporter and fan of Pittsburgh Drum n Bass since the hardcore days, he
cut his teeth spinning on wpts FM starting in 96' and stepped it up
promoting with PBS (see: the Burial). he now spins in rotation at the wed
night drunk'n'bass weekly FUZE, as well as promotes the fringes of
experimental breakbeats with WRECKED distro. With an eye on the past and
an ear to the future, you're likely to hear him drop anything from
breakbeat 'aardcore to mashed up ragga to funked jazz, punishing techstep,
scientific dub or futuristic soul - obscure old cuts, classic jams, and
unheard new bits across the spectrum of drum and bass.

DON
The man behind wizard workshop will be starting it off with some smooth
and soulful drum n bass, creating a warm vibe for you mind and body.

w/ Resident Depth + Blunt MC

Open tables from 10pm - 11pm! (two half-hour slots) - come out for this!

As always, free bottled water while it lasts!

$5
ALL AGES
10pm - 4am

Milk Event Space (in the strip)

Subject: {pb-cle} Thankx

That "Thankx" thing happening next Wednesday in Millvale looks pretty cool. 
Anyone planning on heading out there?

Even if you're not going to the event, its a pretty cool skate place. 
Outdoor ramps, BIG Indoor half, (Think the half was used for the X-Games or 
something when it was built...some kind of special event) and a fully 
featured skate shop inside.

They put a new bowl in the park by the Polish Hill pool a couple months back 
as well. Spring might take a little while to get here though.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Thankx

yeah ... this event 'Thankx' at Mr. Small's Funhouse 
(www.mrsmalls.com)should be really good ... also because it's the night 
before thanksgiving, one of the biggest nights to go out ...

Victor and Antone are throwing it.  The Revolution Of Jazmen should be tight 
... they have played at Havana before but have recently added an upright 
bass player to their line-up.  Hill Jordan plays trumpet and trombone for 
them and he always puts on a great show at Havana.

plus Intergalactic Faerie Funk out of Philly will be performing live, XA 
with special guest Phat Man Dee and DJs: 7up, Elysium, Kaleo, Adam Oliveri 
and Keith LeWinter

$10 / 21 + / free beer provided by the Foundry Ale Works

can't beat it.

Worth a shot, anyone want to get a netmeet going?  haven't been here 
so can't really say where a good spot would be.  At the least, I'll 
be there in my usual "o" (oakley logo) hat and hopefully my wtf? 
shirt if I can find it :D

This years new years party won't be extraordinary, won't be loaded with
big name headliners, and won't break you, but will be high quality with
class, filled with "headliner quality" artists, fun and stress free to
enjoy the company of friends, and something to bring back memories and
create ever lasting ones.

Ppl lets take a break from all of the talk of techno bashing, pgh 
vs. universe, passion,blah blah blah.  and get back to listening 
and enjoying good music (insert your favorite genre here).

So with that in mind go to groove tonight, and stay late. Colin 
Pierce is going to close out the main room with a fierce techno 
set. 

If you think techno djs are stuck up their own arse. 

come out to groove tonight. 

if you think techno djs are mostly boring and need to throw some 
turntablist tricks into their set.

come out to groove tonight. 

if you think techno is nothing more than banging drums with no 
funk.

come out to groove tonight. 

and get a lesson from Colin Pierce, one of the most passionate 
individuals i've met in this scene.

i'll be there.

Jwan

Im looking for a rollerskateing rink in NE Ohio for an event in the future as well.  It would be more like a roller disco though with electro and neo-disco performers and djs.  If I could be picky Id like to find one with a video arcade with only old video games like ms. pac man...not those stupid new ones.  It wouldnt go all night either so thats one less obstacle.  Still just a vague idea but something I plan to get together hopefully next summer. Sounds silly I know. ;p

I think that's all anyone can ask for. I have such fond memories of Barely
Legal 3 despite the horrible infractions by police early in the night. It
was shaping up to be one of the best nights of the year because of the
rock-solid local lineup and excellent price. People were happy to be there.

Fuck, if you get the Poo-Bas crew and the BBM I'll sing nothing but praises.
I know they're not international superstars but they're damn good and play

Plus, Roxy is driving me batty down here about going to Cleveland for NYE.

Fuck that damn place lol... thats where Revolution 2 was redirected, and then 
shut down.  I have very very bad memories of that place.  A couple funny ones 
tho; me dancing on tha sidewalk in front of TV cameras, during Freaky Flow's 
set, as they shut it down Live! on channel 11 lol, and one of an officer 
telling me I "wasn't allowed to dance on tha sidewalk".

Funny, I thought sidewalks were public property ?! 

I'm just on tha Fuck Ohio tip today lol.

ugh cops.
peace.
Chris

Remember when there would be those cute little kandy girls that ran around 
with a whole fukkin box of Blow Pops?  They had all tha best Blow Pops too, 
tha green ones, and even tha blue ones... shit, nowadays, we're lucky to get 
a stick of 'Juicy Fruit' and a promotional 'Red Bull'..." - C.T.N.

I'm going, and excited about the possibility of
hearing some dark jungle (a little birdie told me so)!
 Anyone who was all about bump for 5 dollars should be
in heaven with another night for the same price in a
row!  I know my pockets don't run too deep right now
either.  Hope to see some of you there.

I was PISSED tho cuz they kept confiscating GLOW STICKS b.c it was ""DRUG PARAPHENILIA"  whatever....  it was fun, i guess, even tho not many people were dancing when i was there.  if you saw me, i was wearing jeans with a blue heart on the butt :)  and a blue shirt.  ok enough outta me 
and p.s.  for whoever is thinking about having a roller rink rave, Chagrin Valley Roller Rink in Chagrin Falls, the number is 216 247 4224 maybe they would rent it out for a night? its small tho, and it closes at 12

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} how was bump?


I thought it was quite nice.  First off though, all promoters take note, 
PLEASE put the jungle room in a well ventalated area.  it seems alot of 
jungle fans smoke like chimneys, it would have been easier to light a bomb 
fire of tobacoo in the room, i tollerated it for a bit cause it was bump'n 
yet i actually think i have nicoteen withdrawl from beeing in that room and 
i don't even smoke.

BTW, peabodies is a club and they do take what seems to be unnesesarie 
precausions about gear you bring in.  If you think about it, they are smart. 
  You don't really need glowsticks, and anything that takes the heat away 
from the space if valid.  Not having any thing drug related acording to the 
police is a smart move, so don't be sore that they don't allow it.  Its more 
important that we have nice venues like that that to have it jeprodized by 
the ignorance of law inforcement.

I really really want to know who the girl spinning upstairs at about 2 Am 
is.  I often forget that the sounds that i truely like are what they are.   
She was spinning some bomb stuff, and it reminded me that although i like 
certain strange sounding shit that there is a fraction of people that are in 
the mind frame to actually like the same shit.  I often forget that after 
bouncing shit off people to see what they think and get negative feedback 
because they aren't hip to the strange factor of sound that i often get off 
on.  She played some tracks that floored me cause its what i really like.  
Thats an important thing to be reminded of.  thanks whoever you are.

I don't get out as much as I'd like so it was  nice to see a few familliar 
faces, like VR and vitaminC and another lurker i forgot the name.

thanks for a nice show

Good party!  First party i've been to in a while, and I had a lot of fun...
peabodie's has changed since the last time I was there, I like it, its a
comfortable venue with plenty of places to just chill.
Security was cool, I head they were confinscating glow sticks, but *shrug* i
dont use them anyway.
well its 6pm.. i woke up 2 hours ago...time to go to another party..

peace

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} how was bump?

I was amazed, first by the turnout and by the amount of quality 
talent there.  There were so many dj's there I never heard of, but 
really tore it up.  Such as whoever that girl was upstairs.  also the 
first 2 dj's in the main room were really good, first time I heard 
electroclash somewhere.  Seemed like there were some issues with 
skipping durring some of the more beat pounding moments, I'm guessing 
it's because the tables were set up on cinder blocks with a piece of 
wood for the table, not exactly the best sound absorption.

Only really had a couple problems there.  First off the REALLY late 
start.  They let people in around 10:15 ish but didn't have any music 
till around 10:45, 11:00.  Just seemed really late.  Also the whole 
glowstick confiscation thing had me ticked off for a moment there.  I 
just took out those LED lights I have and some guy came up to me and 
said they was sign that they were confiscating lights or kicking 
people out.  Not sure who the guy was but figured if he told me about 
it as soon as I got them out, figured it was true.  Plus I did find 
it odd no one else seemed to have them for the number of people that 
were there.  I would seriously think about not going to another party 
at peabodies because of that.  I know it's not the promoter's fault, 
it seemed to be purely a venue rule.  Just got me pissed off and 
confirms my little belief that rumors turn into fact after a while.  
For a while there were 'rumors' that glow sticks were used by 
druggies to 'enhance the effects'.  I'm not a druggie and I still 
like glowsticks and stuff as long as people know what they're doing 
and not having glowsticks whacking people in the head :D.  Surprised 
they didn't tell me to get rid of the bracelets too (just have a 
couple non-attention-getting ones)  and I know they saw them because 
I had to move them out of the way so they could put that 21+ band 
thing on.  What's next, since druggies wear hats, that means that no 
one can wear hats anymore?  I know I'm kinda getting off-topic 
parnoidish with this, but I do that a lot :)

btw, i took about 30 or so pics that I'll get up eventually...

Yea, they kicked me out my first 15mins there, but they always do that with
me.
I think someone there has a grudge against me cause i think he's gay... :)
Thats the reason why I dont go there, but its been a long while for me, so I
decided to go.
blah blah...

I needed to leave anyways.. i had to work in the morning.. :)

  That makes me happy that people noticed that most of the fuckups in my set were from skips....I hate excuses but there were some serious skipping issues.  I was the first person on in the main room so my set was basiclly the sound check.  I was disappointed in my overall performance though but I hope some people enjoyed it.  Hopefully I can get a chance to get out there again and present the tunes I love in a better fashion.  I'll have a mix cd ready to go soon as well which I will get copies to those interested.
  Just to clear up one thing...and no offense.  I've said it again and again so Im sure its getting redundant.  But what I was playing I wouldnt call "electroclash" (seeing that it isnt an actual genre anyways, its just the name of a NY music festival which Larry Tee owns the rights to).  It was a mix of electro and neo-disco aka ElectroDiscoRobotFunk.  I played a couple rare classic italo disco tunes too.  Im sorry for saying it so much but IMO the term "electroclash" and the artists ariseing from the movement are giving the rest of the stuff going on in the modern electro scene a bad name because people read stuff about the crazy fashionable stage shows in trendy fashion magazines.  The best stuff coming out in electro and neo-disco currently and for the past several years (prior to the term "electroclash") has been from European countries such as France, Italy, Netherlands, and Finland and is not about fashion at all.  If you would have seen the Bunker Records tour in September with Legowelt and Orgue Electronique (which I played some of last night), you would have seen that these guys dont prance around in fashionable 80's outfits like a bunch of clowns but that they are just average looking knob twiddling music geeks.  Again sorry for saying it so much but myself and the artists that I am into are attempting to kill the whole misinformation surrounding "electroclash" and trying to disassociate ourselves from the NY fad.  I guess its pretty stupid but its something we feel strongly about.  Im sure you had the same thing in the early "punk" scene when the media tagged the name "punk" to it and the artists would say "were not punk thats just a media name".  
   One other thing I wanted to mention is that I really have a new appreciation for disco-house.  A couple years ago you could have caught me saying "man I hate disco-house" but after listening to neo-disco and italo disco for a while now I have a new found appreciation for disco house and I really enjoyed Mike Love's set.
Take Care

really tore it up. Such as whoever that girl was upstairs. also the 
first 2 dj's in the main room were really good, first time I heard 
electroclash somewhere. Seemed like there were some issues with 
skipping durring some of the more beat pounding moments, I'm guessing 
it's because the tables were set up on cinder blocks with a piece of 
wood for the table, not exactly the best sound absorption.

Only really had a couple problems there. First off the REALLY late 
start. They let people in around 10:15 ish but didn't have any music 
till around 10:45, 11:00. Just seemed really late. Also the whole 
glowstick confiscation thing had me ticked off for a moment there. I 
just took out those LED lights I have and some guy came up to me and 
said they was sign that they were confiscating lights or kicking 
people out. Not sure who the guy was but figured if he told me about 
it as soon as I got them out, figured it was true. Plus I did find 
it odd no one else seemed to have them for the number of people that 
were there. I would seriously think about not going to another party 
at peabodies because of that. I know it's not the promoter's fault, 
it seemed to be purely a venue rule. Just got me pissed off and 
confirms my little belief that rumors turn into fact after a while. 
For a while there were 'rumors' that glow sticks were used by 
druggies to 'enhance the effects'. I'm not a druggie and I still 
like glowsticks and stuff as long as people know what they're doing 
and not having glowsticks whacking people in the head :D. Surprised 
they didn't tell me to get rid of the bracelets too (just have a 
couple non-attention-getting ones) and I know they saw them because 
I had to move them out of the way so they could put that 21+ band 
thing on. What's next, since druggies wear hats, that means that no 
one can wear hats anymore? I know I'm kinda getting off-topic 
parnoidish with this, but I do that a lot :)

btw, i took about 30 or so pics that I'll get up eventually...

I just couldn't think of what else to call it.  it was house, but had

Figures, I was looking forward to seeing you and all and you get 
kicked out.  BTW, were you the one that had her money 'hidden' 
somewhere in the building?  I was near it when one of the people that 
worked there mentioned someone got kicked out and he was getting her 
stuff that was xxx (won't say, in case other's want to use it :D ).

Subject: {pb-cle} cleveland saturday revue

mr scruff @ touch
pimp shit, nice place, my first time, glad I actually decided to explore
and found the downstairs, prolly had the nicest dj setup I ever saw
what model vestax mixer are they using down there?
mr scruff was really great, looked and sounded like a natural born
club dj, I heard some of the trouser jazz tracks he was playing, twas good
can't wait to get the album
the soundsystem downtairs is really something, the crowd is better too

pitch black @ hi-fi
cool show, cleveland jungle massif repre-sent (or something)
some dnb DJ put on some cool dnb tracks while I was there

digweed @ moda
too expensive and I don't own any nice shoes, and
that's all I've got to say about that

daaamn, cleveland's junpim

>what model vestax mixer are they using down there?

it was a vestax pmc-37 pro.  mr. scruff i think is touring with that mixer, 
because i know the house mixer for touch is the djm-500 (you could see that 
they actually daisy chained the pmc-37 to the fx unit and then to the 
djm-500 which was standing up against the wall).

i was also blown away by mr. scruff's performance.  how about all of those 
breaks seven inches!  anybody that missed out on tonight definitely missed 
out on one the best nights that i've been to in a long time, and that 
cleveland has seen in a long time as well.

dan.

Last week someone posted a link to a mix they just finished. Nu-skool 
breaks, 160kbps encoding, 25:49 long, simply entitled "mixed.mp3"

I've been rocking it this Sunday and must say that its pretty dope shit 
IMHO. Who's the deejay again?

Thanks for sharing it. Kick ass

I just got to the station to do my Sunday 9-12 show and was informed the station is now brodcasting on the web live.  I'll be on until 12 playing idm, breakcore, electro, neo-disco, ambient, and other assorted musics.

Goto.....www.radiofreecanton.net and click listen live.  I think after that it takes you to the pirateradionetwork where you have to scroll down and look for radio free canton.  Let me know if you can pick this up cause I just found out about it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} bump, are we that cheap these days??

there is no sense of history, these promoters seriously probably didn't know
there was a party called bump.

i was looking through flyers from the very early 90s for chicago parties and
alot of parties down here had the same names and similar conecepts.

i used to tell promoters when they submit something that they are using a
recycled name, but most ignored me or fluffed it off, so i don't waste my
time anymore.

What is the human race going to do if it is around in 2,000 years?  I say
let people copy or reuse ideas.  There isn't a infinite number of words, let
alone, words with enough impact to make all the little kiddies show up to
your bomb show with all your bomb talent.

sampling, re-using reggae riddims, cover songs, etc have been used 
in music constantly in modern culture (and might i add, have been 
used extensively, groundbreakingly, and rather effectively in 
music pioneered by black people). ideas should be explored, not 
visited once and forgotten.

Subject: {pb-cle} Bump 3 pictures

I got the pictures from Bump 3 online.

My 'raves' page (nothing there but direct links to all the parties I 
took pictures at):
http://www.vrillusions.com/raves.shtml

If you want to skip that and go directly to the party's pics:
http://www.vrillusions.com/gallery?currDir=.&jump=bump3

They are also mirrored on the pb-cle list, too.  Can't remember the 
direct link, but just click on the picture archive link to see it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} bump, are we that cheap these days??

i have to agree with darw_n...

when i posted my question a while back about the Bump party that i had a
flyer for, it was from (my guess) 95-96. i believe it was a series that was
either once a month or every two weeks... now i am gonna have to dig out
that flyer :)

but anyway... my point is that they HAD to have known about that party. how
coincidental do you think it is that they have a series of parties with the
same type of flyers designed for them?

the original Bump flyer that i have is a foldout, but the front is a street
sign like the one on this most recent one.

it's one thing to use a name, and perhaps either know or not, but completely
another to steal the flyer idea as well. that's when you are totally lacking
in creativity and originality, IMO.

good morning all,
dori

http://www.shoutcast.com

There are a LOT of streaming stations sortable by genre, encoding rate, 
number of streams, etc.

bassdrive.com has some choice drum 'n' breaks as well

radiofg.com has some good house

shoutcast is the greatest because you can find something for any mood.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} bump, are we that cheap these days??

I think that someone could easily come up with the "bump" idea 
independently. Its a double/triple entendre at a minimum, so it easily 
appeals and comes to mind.

In my estimation, there is only one overwhelming concept that would 
associate itself with that title. Namely the street sign. I honestly think 
that there is a possibility that this is a unique idea spawned from similar 
thought processes, rather than style biting.

I say give them the benefit of the doubt. For crying out loud, I thought 
about that idea many times when driving with the system "bumping" and I 
wasn't even aware of flyers until 1997. The bump concept is simply not that 
earth shattering as to think only one person could dream it up.

i have to agree with darw_n...

when i posted my question a while back about the Bump party that i had a
flyer for, it was from (my guess) 95-96. i believe it was a series that was
either once a month or every two weeks... now i am gonna have to dig out
that flyer :)

but anyway... my point is that they HAD to have known about that party. how
coincidental do you think it is that they have a series of parties with the
same type of flyers designed for them?

the original Bump flyer that i have is a foldout, but the front is a street
sign like the one on this most recent one.

it's one thing to use a name, and perhaps either know or not, but completely
another to steal the flyer idea as well. that's when you are totally lacking
in creativity and originality, IMO.

good morning all,
dori

ya there seemed to bea lot of csu kids there, just tons of people 
wit the glowsticks thing, a lot of people had those little ones stuck in their ears!!! :0i danced w/ my cell phone lit up like a glowstick, but then i was afraid they would take it too :)
anyway, ya i can relate, i am no druggie but i love stuff that glows in the dark, next time i am wearing glow in the dark nailpolish, cuz they cant do shit about that!! and some peoples were wearing backpacks anyway, i gues they had them in their pockets and then put them on when they got inside
hey todd, can u lemme know ur website? i wanna see pictures!!!  i bet it was more intense the later it got and people started dancing.  
ALSO ANYBODY GOING TO THE FEAST??? I AM TRYING TO GO EARLY (FREE FOOD< BABY!)

Message-ID: <3DDFFDB8.2090.113123F@localhost>

I was amazed, first by the turnout and by the amount of quality 
talent there.  There were so many dj's there I never heard of, but 
really tore it up.  Such as whoever that girl was upstairs.  also the 
first 2 dj's in the main room were really good, first time I heard 
electroclash somewhere.  Seemed like there were some issues with 
skipping durring some of the more beat pounding moments, I'm guessing 
it's because the tables were set up on cinder blocks with a piece of 
wood for the table, not exactly the best sound absorption.

Only really had a couple problems there.  First off the REALLY late 
start.  They let people in around 10:15 ish but didn't have any music 
till around 10:45, 11:00.  Just seemed really late.  Also the whole 
glowstick confiscation thing had me ticked off for a moment there.  I 
just took out those LED lights I have and some guy came up to me and 
said they was sign that they were confiscating lights or kicking 
people out.  Not sure who the guy was but figured if he told me about 
it as soon as I got them out, figured it was true.  Plus I did find 
it odd no one else seemed to have them for the number of people that 
were there.  I would seriously think about not going to another party 
at peabodies because of that.  I know it's not the promoter's fault, 
it seemed to be purely a venue rule.  Just got me pissed off and 
confirms my little belief that rumors turn into fact after a while.  
For a while there were 'rumors' that glow sticks were used by 
druggies to 'enhance the effects'.  I'm not a druggie and I still 
like glowsticks and stuff as long as people know what they're doing 
and not having glowsticks whacking people in the head :D.  Surprised 
they didn't tell me to get rid of the bracelets too (just have a 
couple non-attention-getting ones)  and I know they saw them because 
I had to move them out of the way so they could put that 21+ band 
thing on.  What's next, since druggies wear hats, that means that no 
one can wear hats anymore?  I know I'm kinda getting off-topic 
parnoidish with this, but I do that a lot :)

btw, i took about 30 or so pics that I'll get up eventually...

  Did anyone go to Steve Lawler in Columbus on Friday?  I would of loved to go but I had to stay local.  
  I ended up going to BUMP which was fun.  I enjoyed Dennis Cox and Mike Love's set.  Was dancing until 4am!
  To bad about Digweed at Moda, I heard people drove all the way from Boston to see him.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FW: john digweed

John Digweed is a true professional,

   There was a certain other DJ that had the same circumstances due to food 
illness (sushi) that played in Atlanta about 5 weeks ago.  He had an off 
night that night, and then played VERY sub-par in Charlotte the next night 
at Mythos.  It's one thing to force yourself to play when your sick, but 
when a 1000+ plus people are paying 30 - 60 dollars to see your face behind 
the decks; it's professional to "call in sick" and then appoligise for 
circumstances you could not control.


   Hope he is feeling better and to see him in the area soon!

Promoters should employ the same people that come up with drug names.

Nexium
Celexa
ultracet
wellbutrin
Zithromax
Premarin
and of course
Viagra

You are all free to use those names.  They were on pens in my waiters gear.

Subject: {pb-cle} feast

    just curious who was planning to attend feast this
    wednesday?

    from the cool page grandpa [M] josh made, there
    are only a couple people going, thus far...
    http://www.hyperreal.org/~mesh/netmeets/Feast

    i am particularly excited for: ian mariano, djmoose
    and evan evolution. i am also excited to hear some
    of the djs that i have yet to hear live, but heard many
    good things about (chris eberhart, cubby and still
    life :) plus, we get the rare chance to do visuals for
    the night. woo hoo!

    anyway, hope to see some people there!

Just a little FYI.  As you know, Digweed did not make it.  Moda did the
right thing and let EVERYONE in for free... so that was cool of them.

You're too kind... but yes, the roster isn't looking too impressive these

Yes, coming out of hiding is the photon-kinetix ensemble. I look forward to

Me too. It would be nice to see that big pussy Darw______n come out of

turn my attention to punishing him.

I hope to make it up there, but not positive to sign up on "the list" 
since I have school that night (yep, the day before thanksgiving and 
I'm going to be at school, perhaps no one will show up like on 
halloween--It was just me and one other guy in the first class and 
just me in the second)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FW: john digweed

Guess I have heard too many jokes, but ANYthing that starts out with "Funk 
and Bad Boy Bill" just cracks me the fuck up. Now just add Keoki to the 
beginning and we'll have a good ole laugh.

I am not dissing your messiah Chris, I am referring to a series of jokes 
that have been floating around for years. No wait I am dissing him.

I heard that Funk and Bad Boy Bill caught Keoki in a hotel room with a 15 
year old boy, which was stipulated in the performance contract, and Keoki 
shot Bad Boy Bill in the eye. No word on the result of the injuries.

Funk and bad boy bill and humpty vision all are waitn to see him  around, 
too. Apparently diggers likes to leave unsettled debts, and  word is hes 
just avoiding the house connection, cuz theyre gonna glock  his ass.

Actually,  Digweed is Keoki!  Keoki uses this alias when he spins the
heartland!  You see the bad vibes all started when Funk was helping Bad Boy
Bill and RHV with House Connection 3, when a K'd out Keoki rolled up on them
saying he could "Bang tha Box" harder than any of them.  This just pissed
off the House Connection Crew. They have sensitive feelings since becoming
big shot sell-outs!

Subject: {pb-cle} Turkey Day @ Havana

I usually don't like to post this early but I just want to give a heads up 
before the holidays kick in ...

Havana will be open on Thanksgiving Day.

I don't know what it will be like - could be dead - but I'm getting some 
good response from people saying they usually have nothing to do later in 
the evening on Thanksgiving Day ... so with that said ... come join us at 
Havana ...

I spoke with a few DJ's yesterday and it looks like we're going to have fun 
regardless of the crowd.

I'll have the line-up ready for posting by tomorrow - so far it looks like 
DC Space, Kaleo and 7-Up will all be spinning.

Jason C.
Havana

"the original Bump flyer that i have is a foldout, but the front is a 
street
sign like the one on this most recent one."

 

of course it was made to look like a sign, haven't you ever seen one of those signs, warning you about an upcoming bump, while you were driving????? maybe it was just an accident b.c that 's what i think of when i hear that word (tho maybe now i would think of the party when i heard that word :)

Velvet Tuesday 

The Final Chapter


Alas all good things come to and end and tonight will be our final 
night of Velvet at the Memphis Lounge.  When Adam, Andy and I 
started the night a few months ago our goal was to showcase the 
finest sounds in electronic music, and I believe we have 
accomplished that goal. Personally I would like to thank, every DJ 
and Live PA that sacrificed a few hours of sleep on a Tuesday 
night and played for us. And I would also like to thank all the 
patrons who have supported us week after week; it=92s nice to see we 
aren=92t the only ones who enjoy cheap beer specials.:)

So before we all head home to our nagging families this weekend, 
come out and join us one last time.

DJs for the Final Velvet

Thomas Cox and myself (Adam is currently in Dublin as I write 
this) We=92ll be tagging all night, playing all the music we like, 
weather it be house, techno, 2 =96step, broken beat, electro, or 
disco. If either one of us have it on vinyl you=92ll hear it 
tonight.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: Velvet

I hope I still have post only access to the list as I am unsubscribed
currently while away .. It's 12am here but I think its most likely 7pm
there so this will be timely:

I would like to chime in and basically repeat everything Jwan said below. 
I wish we had more time to build up velvet into the night it could
(should) be, but unfortunately it comes down to bar $$$, and Zythos has to
do what it has to do.

I appreciate the patronage of all the people from this list that did come
out, and the atmosphere and vibe you helped create.  I hope you all came
away with something musically, and enjoyed yourself (and the $1
yuenglings!).

I'm unsure as to whether we will attempt to do another night based around
the same theme (the best soulful and chill electronic dance music in the
city, for free) anytime soon, but perhaps it will indeed happen again.  I
haven't given up!

So please, if you can, come out and support the last velvet tuesday, even
if you have never come out to it in the past.  Make it something to
remember! and guzzle down as many $1 iron cities and yuenglings, since as
of next week, that special will most likely never be seen again :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Thanks to who came to Mr. Scruff @ Nitty Gritty

OnPoint Entertainment, Headroom Digital, and Touch woul like to thank everyone who came to Nitty Gritty @ Touch last Saturday 11/23. Mr. Scruff laid down some serious gems during his 4.5 hour set. The place was packed with a diverse crowd of party people. It was cool to see alot of new faces to go along with the usual suspects. Everyone had a smile on their face and were dancing up a sweat. Actually, I think that Scruff might have provided the best Nitty Gritty musically to date. 

For pictures and write ups check out:

The next Nitty Gritty will be:

Saturday DECEMBER 7, 2002:
The APHRODESIATICS with Neil Chastain
(Live 7 piece funk/hip-hop band, Cleveland)

JUGOE
(Headroom Digital, Cleveland)

MISTERBRADLEYP
(Nitty Gritty, Cleveland)

Pardon my ignorance, but there's actually a DJ named Big John Stud? That so
rules. I think I want to hear some of his stuff just for that alone.

-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Full Bio for Fabio & Grooverider
>From playing pirate radio to residing at Britain's most exciting and 
ground breaking clubs, Fabio & Grooverider have forged a path that has 
shaped the sound of drum 'n' bass and been vital in establishing the 
house, techno and early breakbeat scenes in the UK. The duo first hooked 
up in early 1987 at Phase One, a pirate radio station which also featured 
the likes of Colin Dale and David Angel. An instant rapport was 
established as Fabio dropped funk and soul numbers over Grooverider's hip 
hop beats. With acid house, they started DJing together at Mendoza's - an 
after hours haunt in Brixton full of the Shoom crowd. Quickly establishing 
a name for themselves, they began playing all the major raves, spinning a 
mixture of Detroit house and early rave. Fabio & Grooverider have always 
been a couple of steps ahead of their contemporaries, laying down early 
European techno way back in 1989, and developing the first UK breakbeat as 
long ago as 1991 at seminal club night Rage. They've also played 
extensively on the rave and house circuits for years, both together and 
separately.

Thu Nov 28                       KOOL KEITH                        Columbus

Thanksgiving Night, Thursday November 28 @ Little Brothers 1100 N. High
Roots Records and On The Floor Productions Present:
 
Kool Keith w/ Jacky Jasper 
Kool Keith is a legendary New York emcee who is widely known in 
underground circles for his revolutionary style and ability to transform 
his delivery through the many concept albums he has become famous for 
under his Black Elvis, Dr. Dooom (correct spelling), Dr. Octagon, and 
Poppa Large monikers.  In the mid-1980's Kool Keith (a.k.a. Keith 
Thornton) was a founding member of the now legendary Ultramagnetic MCs 
(featuring T.R. Love, Ced Gee and DJ Moe Love).  They began recording 
their first tracks alongside KRS-1 and Scott la Rock in Ced Gee's house 
and Ced produced half of Boogie Down Productions' classic 'Criminal 
Minded' album.  The UMC's are widely regarded as as one of the foremost 
innovators of the late 80's New York hip-hop scene.  Chuck D (of Public 
Enemy) even went as far as to brand them 'KINGS of the Singles.'  Kool 
Keith is joined by Jacky Jasper, who is known as one half of another Kool 
Keith project, the Analog Brothers. 

Super Smash Bros. 
Columbus' own Super Smash Bros. consist of Camu Tao (perhaps better known 
for his work with Mhz and WEATHERMEN) and Metro.  They are fresh off of 
the recent Def Jux tour with Def Jux head El-P (of Compay Flow fame), 
Akrobatik, Mr. Lif, and RJD2 amongst others.

"Rock the Bells 2, The Second Ringing" featuring the following djs and/or 
acts........


Donald_Glaude ( Moonshine Records, Eden Records ) Los Angeles, California
A veteran DJ for over 15 years, Donald Glaude has cemented his reputation 
as a crowd-rocking favorite and one of the most in demand artists in the 
country. He is one of those rare DJs who perceives their role to be that 
of an all-around entertainer and performer. He exudes energy, dropping 
track after funky track, arms aloft, and has been known to join the 
dancers on the floor. Join us at Rock the Bells 2 to witness the man DJ 
Dan considers "one of the most entertaining DJs in America to watch live." 
__________________________________________________

Huge Surprise Orlando Breaks dj to be announced seconds before he takes 
stage. This guy has accomplished many things in the breaks world and 
people all over are playing his records. His blend of progressive and 
funky breaks will leave you in awe and wanting more, he flat out rocks the 
decks, and has done it in Dayton before.
__________________________________________________

UF0_! ( Phunkatech Records, Phylum Recordings, Circa ) New York City
Featured in magazines such as URB, XLR8R, Lotus, Mixmag, Knowledge, and 
many other 'zines, UFO! is one of the most sought after producers in the 
United States. Record labels across the country clamor for a UFO! remix, 
which guarantees a dance floor hit. A Bay Area native, UFO! pioneered the 
San Francisco Drum and Bass scene and co-founded the much respected 
Phunckateck collective, creating a new community in music. Now residing in 
New York City he is rocking more crowds then ever.
__________________________________________________

Charly ( Bassdrive, Well Known Djs ) Philadelphia
Spinning around the East Coast over the past few years has gained Charly 
the reputation for clean sets, crazy mixes, and an incredible vibe behind 
the decks. Headlining around the country with UFO!, Juan Atkins, DJ Seen, 
and AK1200, has earned, as well as provided, Charly immense respect. Once 
Charly is seen in action, it's easily understood why she has been touted 
to be the next best thing for the US Drum-n-Bass Scene. At the young age 
of only 18 she is sure to be the next superstar in drum and bass.
__________________________________________________

Trevor_Lamont ( NateFx, Soulbrothaz, Aliensquad ) Lexington KY
Trevor is one of the most respected and skilled DJs in the Midwest and is 
never to be missed as you might miss something spectacular. His experience 
reflects on his sets as he can always work the crowd with his soulful 
house music and break it down to its roots.vs.Samm-e ( Soulbrothaz, U.S. 
Hispanix, House Purists, Dr. Sun Prod, Senor MTSU ) Murfreesboro
Samm-e is one third of the nationally acclaimed Teamsters crew consisting 
of him, Halo, and Trevor Lamont. When he hits the decks there is a vibe 
that comes over the room and with him on two while T is on two, things 
could get crazy, and memorable.
__________________________________________________

Guy_Smilee ( www.gagproductions.com, www.neutralmusic.net ) Rochester, New 
York
Guy Smilee is one of the most popular happy hardcore djs in the US and 
with Jumper by his side they always bring the house down. Guy can scratch 
with about any part of his body, and make sure you watch on November 30th 
as you can see him in action. Like I said Jumper will be by his side and 
you all know he can rock it and let's show him how much we love him in 
Ohio. w/ Mc_Jumper ( GAG, Ruffneck Playaz Crew, www.neutralmusic.net ) 
Rochester, New York
__________________________________________________

Big Regional Surprise Act to close out the main room and rock it for an 
hour. These guys have been ripping it for a year now and have been ripping 
it all together for about 2 years. They made their debut last year on 
December 15th and will be closing out the main room at 5 with a set to be 
remembered for a lifetime.
__________________________________________________

Kid Chaos ( In the Groove, Infinity Prod )
This house music enthusiast is always a hit on the dancefloor. His fusion 
of disco house and groovy tech-house has helped him gain recognition 
throughout the midwest and get him on lineups with names such as Too 
Short, Sandra Collins, and more.
__________________________________________________

HE10 ( In The Groove ) Tucson, Arizona
Coming to us all the way from Tucson he is ready to throw down the dopest 
uplifting trance we have seen in a long time. The awesome track selection 
and flawless mixing will bring him back to our city more often, hopefully.
__________________________________________________

Mike_Donovan ( Bounce Theory, Scarab Records ) Dayton, Ohio
Mike is co-founder of the Bounce Theory in Dayton Ohio. Deep tech-house 
music for the sophisticated listener featuring smooth, deep, jazzy 
grooves. He will be promoting his new cd Paint the Town Redd so be close 
to the decks and you might get a copy.
__________________________________________________

Chromix_live pa ( Groovefuel Recordings, Do:Loop Records ) Cleveland
This Northern Ohio progressive and hard trance producing phenomenon has 
been writing tracks since the age of 15. His unique and powerful live set 
will leave you begging for more and make sure you watch out for his first 
release on Groovefuel Recordings later this year.
__________________________________________________

Matthew_Kelly ( 4-Score Productions, Katatonic Resident ) Nashville
This crazy scratching breaks master representing Nashville will make his 
first Wishing Well appearance and a long awaited one at that. Make sure to 
catch his set as his whole crew including Michelle make it up from 
Nashvegas.
__________________________________________________

Clay-Born ( Wishing Well, Breakline Crew ) Louisville
Clay is always bringing a new crate of records and a totally awesome 
performance to every event which keeps his sets fresh and new and the vibe 
totally flowing to the deep basslines and dirty beats that make up 
nu-skool breaks.
__________________________________________________

Foursqare ( Wishing Well, Metronomix ) Louisville
Last year around this time a dj was born to the scene to show everyone how 
to rock it, Foursqare style. The dope ass house sets she drops are enough 
to make people like Paul Johnson and other house legends say WHOA!!! 
__________________________________________________

e21 ( :SCENE:, Stellar Gruve ) Atlanta
The man behind SCENE Ohio made his first Wishing Well debut at the last 
Rock the Bells and rocking it this year will be no different. The trance 
selections he brings to the table are amazing and his attitude towards the 
music and his presence on stage show it all.
__________________________________________________

Nero_X ( Hypnotik Therapy ) Cincinnati
You thought you wouldn't hear the techno but what party is a party without 
techno. Get there early to hear this man bring it hard. Dino is an up and 
coming superstar in the Ohio scene so look out for him whenever you can.
__________________________________________________

Jigglypuff ( Independent ) Cincinnati
If you thought Guy Smilee was enough happy hardcore for the night you were 
totally mistaken because this guy will bring it in early to set the vibe 
and the night off on the right foot. Let the man we call Chester know how 
much we love him and be right next to the decks when he throws down.
__________________________________________________

Def_Leper ( Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids ) Dayton
What can I say? Sliced bread had a good, long run but now this is the best 
thing to hit the scene. If you miss this set you should be shot with many 
Fruit Pebbles until your bum is sore. The 80's pop and hardcore mixture 
will have you dancing on tables and screaming at the top of your lungs.

***WINTER WONDERLAND 2***

DDR - London, United Kingdom (LIVE PA) - www.damndjs.com - Techno/Acid 
Techno - Few names in the world of techno have achieved more acclaim than 
DDR.  One of the original founders of the London Acid movement, he's been 
on the live circuit for over 12 years.  A producer and remixer who's 
talents have enabled him to travel the world over, DDR has over 100 vinyl 
releases to his credit on major labels like his own Hazchem& COSHH as well 
as Stay Up Forever, Cluster and Choci's Chewns.  Whether you like trance 
house or techno, it's likely you've heard his music hundreds of times 
before and you probably own many CDS with songs by him on them.  NOW YOU 
CAN SEE THIS TECHNO LEGEND LIVE!  Prepare yourself for amazing, mind 
blowing techno and acid set.  First time in OHIO!

Chris Anderson - Houston, Texas - Crackhouse, Catalyst - House/Acid/Techno 
- Chris Anderson is one of those rare jacks-of-all-trades who has his hand 
in just about every aspect of the underground electronic/dance scene He 
runs a record store (Chemistry Records), runs a record label (Crackhouse), 
produces tracks, DJs all over the world, and promotes parties as part of 
the Matrix Crew. Anderson has been DJing out at parties for about a 
decade. 
He has created the floor-destroying remix of "50,000 Watts" (Blubba Boy, 
Caffeine & E-Traxx UK), which has been hammered by lots of the world's top 
jocks, including Carl Cox, DJ Dan, Judge Jules, and countless others, as 
well as memorable tracks like Overdose, Phreak-E andRolling Bass on labels 
such as Catalyst and his own imprint CrackhouseRecords. Anderson's 
production skills reflect his experience with underground electronic 
culture and if you like hard, techy, funky and acidic beats - look no 
further!

DJ Rip - Chicago, Illinois - Substance USA - www.fusedmanagement.com / 
www.djrip.com - Hard Progressive/Hard House - You know him, you love him 
and after last year's performance, we just had to bring him back.

over the U.S. and Canada and on into Europe.  His production work includes 
works with Angel Alanis, Bam Bam, Alex Peace and more.  Rip is now taking 
his efforts to the next level moving his work into the progressive/tech

throughout the Midwest and Canada together and separately, they have left

bass lines, they will be performing a special hour and a half tag team
that will shake the plaster from the ceiling.  Drum and Bass at it's
finest!

Sunnee - Denver, Colorado - UK Hard House - Hardhouse princess Sunnee has 
been a mainstay of the Denver party scene for the past several years. A 
natural behind the decks, Sunnee's slick mixing and
impeccable track selection have propelled her out of the regional scene 
with tour stops in the Midwest as well as residencies in Miami and 
production work in London.  We saw this beauty rockin it out at the 2002 
WMC in Florida and had to bring her in to Ohio for her first appearance! 
 You won't want to miss this set!

out there.

GlassCity Records Presents:
*Arrival*
Monday, December 23rd 2002
Toledo, Ohio
Robert Armani - Chicago - Techno - High Octane

When you put the words "Chicago" and "Techno" together one man comes to
mind, Robert Armani! The south side "Crown Royal Funksta" has been a
techno staple for the last decade and his discography puts him in a league
all his own. On his first trip to spin in Italy he realized his true
calling while studying to be a Chicago Police officer (we almost lost
him). Just the mention of "Blow It Out", "Burn Out", "Big Dick", "Playing
With a Rubber Band", "Ambulance", and, of course, "Circus Bells", brings
back memories of dancing to them over the past ten years at rave parties
and in clubs all around the world. Dance Mania, ACV, Dust Traxx,
Djax-Up-Beats, and High Octane are the labels where his music has been
released and his remixes of JB3 (Joey Beltram), Paul Johnson, Dave Clarke,
Blake Baxter, Armando, and even Gary Numan have elevated him to the
highest of heights. With sixteen full length album releases and over sixty
single releases it has been hard to avoid Mr. Armani's work while flippin'
through any techno bin. His relentless tour schedule has him on the road
non-stop and his hard hitting, dirty, Chicago Techno has rocked clubs
since his early days of spinning. This is a man of Techno royalty and we
are happy to live under his reign.

Translucent - Chicago - House/Techno - Transparent, DTX 

Translucent, also known as Jason Torres, has been playing and studying
music for over sixteen years. Having been influenced by jazz artists such
as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Charlie Parker, Jason started playing
the trumpet and piano at a young age. His dedication to music earned him a
full jazz scholarship to the prestigious Roosevelt University in Chicago
where, in 1994, he was influenced by another style of music known as House
Music. Jason then began DJing and started something new and fresh in the
dance community: playing live trumpet while spinning records, combining
the elements of live jazz with electronic music. Noticing that Jason had
something special, Paul Johnson, the creator of the gold record "Get, Get
Down," helped Jason create connections in Chicago. Since then, Translucent
has played live trumpet with such greats as Derrick Carter, Timo Maas,
Mark Farina, Gene Farris, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr., Glenn Underground,
Cajmere, Boo Williams, Carlos, and Halo. Recent recording projects include
Glenn Underground's new album on Guidance, work with Derrick Carter on
classic, and Gene Farris on Fluential.

Monster Productions presents...
Bubble Bobble <><>The Bubble Party<><>
Sat Jan 25th 2003
Central, OH
Admission: $15
>From the people who brought you B2S, the 12 hour, $4 parti in downtown... 
Justice, bringing warehouse parties back to Columbus... Back 2 Skool 2, 
keeping the columbus parti scene alive for only $6.... Bubble Bobble. This 
is an fundraiser for a HUGE event in the summer of 2003. This will have 
bubble machines running all night long!
TALENT:
Kevin Reynolds: Live Pa/Techno - Detroit, MI
Kevin is one of the best Techno artist that has ever came across the 
Mid-West and Detroit. His Funky and exhilerating style produced live will 
keep you dancing.
Thomas James: Residual Recordings - Deep House/Min. Techno - Columbus, OH
Thomas James is co-owner, with Titonton Duvante, of Residual Recordings. 
Founded in 1998, Residual is recognized worldwide for it's consistent deep 
house, and melodic techno grooves. The impressive Residual discography
boasts releases by accomplished artists such as Boo Williams, John Tejada, 
Dan Curtin, Fabrice Lig, Todd Sines and Titonton. As a DJ, Thomas James is 
known for his impecable taste in deep house, melodic and minimal techno. 
His track selection inspires and his skill motivates. Thomas has held 
residencies at Axis (Columbus), Club 504 (Columbus), Touch (Cleveland) and 
is currently half the force behind columbus' first all live electronic 
monthly event, Proceed. As host of these evenings, international caliber 
guests have included Kit Clayton, Glenn Underground, DJ Swamp, Dan Bell, 
John Tejada, Robert Hood and Hannah to name a few. Future plans include 
new 
releases on Residual, and another return to Europe where he's played in 
Switzerland and Spain.
JJ BOOGIE: www.wellknowndjs.com / www.groovereactor.com Groovereactor - 
Trance & House - Cincinnati, OH
A veteran behind the decks now in his 7th year, JJ BOOGIE
is one of the names to watch in 2003. Having been booked all over the US 
and in Canada - look for a fresh set of the top dance tracks you will ever 
hear. His peak time sets create an amazing energy and you can expect the 
whole room to be dancing non-stop. He's now touring to support the release 
of his recent mixed CD - GENESIS and his upcoming vinyl album on his own 
Groove Reactor Records.
Quantum: Mythodic/CEG/Ritual - House/Progressive - Columbus, OH
To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.
Nostalgic: Downtown Entertainment - Funky Breaks - Dayton, OH
Aus-10: Ascension DJ's - Intelligent DNB - Columbus, OH
NautiKat: Ascension DJ's - Female UK Hard House/Trance - Columbus, OH
Oompaloompa: Airplane Clique - Trance - Norwood, OH

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} bump, are we that cheap these days??


The thing is, Euphorix threw a series of "street sign" parties, including So 
So Def Children At Play quite some time ago.  They did not knock off an 
entire past series of parties.  Whether they got the idea from something 
else or not, they made it their own.  Since this was Bump 3, they've 
obviously done them for a while and never had a problem with people 
complaining about them stealing ideas.  The graphic deisgner has put out 
plenty of flyers that are entirely his own ideas.(GoMedia)

Two cents...

Leah :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Feast was off the chain!!

Props to Doug for organizing this event.  The dinner was a great idea and 
was much appreciated.  The Spy bar was a pleasant change from the norm and I 
enjoyed the more classier atmosphere.  (err even if I did pass out on a 
chair)  Unfortunately I spent most the night in the basement room and didn't 
wander too far.  The music was excellent though which is was to be expected, 
great job Brent Pollen and Moose.  I had fun talking with some people that I 
haven't seen in awhile.  Mesh made the trip up which was great. My partners 
in crime, Rick and Jes were definately entertaining. Mad respect to George, 
George, Brent, Chris and everyone else for making it an unforgettable 
night..well except for the parts where i blacked out...Great job Doug, your 
definately the "Godfather" of our scene!

Props to Doug for organizing this event. The dinner was a great idea and 
was much appreciated. 

 

 

Much agreed. I had a great time (though having to leave early) and met some really cool people. The food, wine, and atmosphere in general prior to the actual event was excellent, and everything seemed to be carried out top-notch and effortlessly. I'm certainly in favor of a gathering even relatively simular of this nature to be carried out soon... with Doug as master of ceremonies, of course! Thanks again, a very memorable evening indeed.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Feast was off the chain!!

Thank you first of all to Doug Burkhart for making it
truly a night to remember.  It was one of the best
times I have ever had going out.  Thank you Doug for
doing something special for everyone and for allowing
me to be a part of something special.  Also mad props
to Brent for a tight set that I had to miss, Cubby
rocked, Stout got the mood started on the right track,
Jason Soditch got the flow started in the basement,
Ian rocked it and blew it up, Pollen for a good set
and a memorable moment, Evan I know you rocked the
house as usual, and Moose that was a great set and the
cd is also nice and tight.  Matt B and Rick(three)
thanks for getting drunk with me and making complete
fools out of ourselves, Jes hope you had a Happy
Fucking Birthday and now you're finally legal...lol. 
Anthony its always a pleasure to kick it with you and
Chris thank you for coming out and supporting.  And to
everyone else that was there hope you enjoyed
yourselves as much as I did.  Well time to go eat
Thanksgiving dinner.....Happy Thanksgiving everyone
and thank you to all those that supported and made
last night the best pre-game for Thanksgiving.

                           Peace
                          Chris Eberhart

Ive never used a behringer dj mixer but I stand by their studio mixers.  Some people will disagree but I think they are just fooled by the affordable price tag.  In comparison to mackie studio mixers which can be 3 times as much as a behringer with the same options I think they are way better.  Behringers are sturdy and Ive seen them take some serious crashes to the floor and keep working perfectly without a scratch while mackies feel as if they would fall to peices on impact.  I know allot of other people who feel the same way.  But the Dj mixers....I dunno.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} behringer mixers

speaking on studio mixers:

i feel totally the opposite about them, i read about some of the corners
they cut.  all in all make for a weaker physical design.  that in and of
itself didn't turn me off, but the fact that they didn't have any sort of
protection over the faders was enough to make me not want one.

though i did buy a mackie i had intermittent problems on 2 channels, ripped
it apart to find that there was a pinched ribbon cable.   nice.
guess thats a problem with the mackies i've talked to a few others who have
encountered it.

comes to to preference, i do like the layouts of some of both companies
mixers.   i looked at some other brands, newer and older, and of them, i
like the mackie & behringer layouts.

what i'd say is buy it at one of those places with a 100% money back 30-day
deal.  hook it up and give it a spin, don't like it take it back...

looking at the vmx200,
i'd be sold on this feature alone: "professional VCA level engine for utmost
fader precision and reliability."
though that beat sync looking stuff in the middle i'd be wary of whatever
that is, just looks like stuff to get in the way.

i also can add that behringers rack gear seems to have gotten VERY flimsy.
used to feel like a tank, but nowadays the metal is thinner and made from
cheaper parts.  dunno about the dj stuff though.

the guy said that he's fixed a bunch of mackie's with the same problem. o=

speaking on studio mixers:

i feel totally the opposite about them, i read about some of the corners
they cut.  all in all make for a weaker physical design.  that in and of
itself didn't turn me off, but the fact that they didn't have any sort of
protection over the faders was enough to make me not want one.

though i did buy a mackie i had intermittent problems on 2 channels, ripp=
ed
it apart to find that there was a pinched ribbon cable.   nice.
guess thats a problem with the mackies i've talked to a few others who ha=
ve
encountered it.

comes to to preference, i do like the layouts of some of both companies
mixers.   i looked at some other brands, newer and older, and of them, i
like the mackie & behringer layouts.

what i'd say is buy it at one of those places with a 100% money back 30-d=
ay
deal.  hook it up and give it a spin, don't like it take it back...

looking at the vmx200,
i'd be sold on this feature alone: "professional VCA level engine for utm=
ost
fader precision and reliability."
though that beat sync looking stuff in the middle i'd be wary of whatever
that is, just looks like stuff to get in the way.

i also can add that behringers rack gear seems to have gotten VERY flimsy=
.
used to feel like a tank, but nowadays the metal is thinner and made from
cheaper parts.  dunno about the dj stuff though.

I think that mixer would be great for a beginner.  If you have been spinning
for more then 2 years and do more then wedding transitions then you will
probably kill it in 2 months.  A studio mixer doesn't get the same kind of
work out that a dj mixer does (usually).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} behringer mixers

we use behringer 6 channels to run the pa...they work well...but then again
we are just using them to mix 2 channels...and maybe a mic....the 6 channel
doesnt have faders...just pots...behringer just released a new line of
mixers too...i know some ppl that had the dj mixers....the x-fader went
pretty quick....the channel fader took about 8 months of weekly abuse...

i have to agree with trout....their new rack gear doesnt have that tank like
feel...the original ultrabass pro got beat around alot....and it still works
fine...another autocom that was bought about 3 months ago had to get sent
back cuz it came defective(i think a wire wasnt sodered to a pot well)...i
think once you mount their stuff in a good sturdy rack....it should be ok
though...who knows how bad that autocom got beat around before it was
purchased...

personally for me though...if i had about 350 to spend which is where those
berhinger dj mixers land...i would be getting something from vestax...i have
always used their dj mixers...and i have had very minimal problems...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} behringer mixers

I stand by their studio mixers and i would suspect
that the same quality goes into their dj mixers.  I
have mixed on their mixer at Annabells and would have
to say it has a nice set up for the price tag.  But it
does depend on what application you want the dj mixer
for.  If you want to cut it up and get buckwild with
the fader I'd recommend spending the extra cash on
either a Stanton Vestex or Rane(top notch).  But for
straight mixing and mild scratching I'd say for the
price go for it.

Subject: {pb-cle} Vestax endorsement (was behringer mixers)

I'm in full agreement with Nick here.

For the money spent, the Vestax, while it may not feel as sturdy as a tank,
certainly feels like a Hummer. (the vehicle. you gutter-minds!)

I've had my PCV-275 for about 1.5 months now, and I'm happy as a clam with
it.

doesnt have faders...just pots...behringer just released a new line of
mixers too...i know some ppl that had the dj mixers....the x-fader went
pretty quick....the channel fader took about 8 months of weekly abuse...

i have to agree with trout....their new rack gear doesnt have that tank like
feel...the original ultrabass pro got beat around alot....and it still works
fine...another autocom that was bought about 3 months ago had to get sent
back cuz it came defective(i think a wire wasnt sodered to a pot well)...i
think once you mount their stuff in a good sturdy rack....it should be ok
though...who knows how bad that autocom got beat around before it was
purchased...

personally for me though...if i had about 350 to spend which is where those
berhinger dj mixers land...i would be getting something from vestax...i have
always used their dj mixers...and i have had very minimal problems...

I'm in full agreement with Nick here.

For the money spent, the Vestax, while it may not feel as sturdy as a tan=

certainly feels like a Hummer. (the vehicle. you gutter-minds!)

Kicking off his "I'm Psychic You Know..." World Tour with his first live performance in our part of the Midwest since Even Furthur '96.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Vestax endorsement (was behringer mixers)

I've had a Vextax 07 Pro for 3.5 years now and the only aspect 
that has deteriorated is that the crossfader knob broke (my 
fault).  Altho the fader curves aren't great and the adjustable 
curve aspect doesn't work that great... this is because I got one 
of the first models out and they all had this problem.

It's a sturdy mixer and has been carried around to many, many gigs 
(including my weekly radio show) and been used a lot.  Quality 
construction.

Todd

ps-don't get the pmc-01 or whatever that $130 two channel vestax 
is... that one's shit :)

i'm down with the pcv-275 as well. smooth as  
silk crossfader and sturdy eq's. although, i wish  
it had a booth output like the pioneer. oh well,
it's still an excellent mixer for it's price.

I'm in full agreement with Nick here.

For the money spent, the Vestax, while it may not feel as sturdy 
as a tank,
certainly feels like a Hummer. (the vehicle. you gutter-minds!)

I've had my PCV-275 for about 1.5 months now, and I'm happy as a 
clam with
it.

we use behringer 6 channels to run the pa...they work well...but 
then again
we are just using them to mix 2 channels...and maybe a mic....the 
6 channel
doesnt have faders...just pots...behringer just released a new 
line of
mixers too...i know some ppl that had the dj mixers....the x-fader 
went
pretty quick....the channel fader took about 8 months of weekly 
abuse...

i have to agree with trout....their new rack gear doesnt have that 
tank like
feel...the original ultrabass pro got beat around alot....and it 
still works
fine...another autocom that was bought about 3 months ago had to 
get sent
back cuz it came defective(i think a wire wasnt sodered to a pot 
well)...i
think once you mount their stuff in a good sturdy rack....it 
should be ok
though...who knows how bad that autocom got beat around before it 
was
purchased...

personally for me though...if i had about 350 to spend which is 
where those
berhinger dj mixers land...i would be getting something from 
vestax...i have
always used their dj mixers...and i have had very minimal 
problems...
