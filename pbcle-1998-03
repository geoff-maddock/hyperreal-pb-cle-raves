Why can I see her doing this?

Or more to the point, why can I see her as telekinetically, dismantling a

'Bird sorceress'?  Can't see I've seen her in that one yet..

Ever notice how much she looks like Diane from _Genocyber_?

The screwdrier was his right ring finger.  His thumbs had cigarette
lighters in them, but they were only used in the episode on the cruise
ship with all the rich folks.

Hell yeah!!!!  This is one of those raves that reaffirms my faith in
raves, ravers and life in general.  Just got back into my dorm room and
I'm still feeling rather groovy (I shoplifted some of the vibe and took it
with me).  Anywayz, let me break it down for ya:

Venue:  Raskle Club.  Awesome venue.  2 rooms with one being almost
directly above the other.  Not many couches but plenty of little alcoves
to chill and shop in.  Plenty of room to dance in all the rooms and the
dj's were plainly visible and placed in the center.  Will definately check
out other parties held here.

DJs:  Didn't catch many names but Carlos did not show :(  However BamBam
delivered a whoop-ass batch of booty house that had everyone moving.
Product 19 kicked things up in his usual manner with a VERY trancy set.
All dj's were quality tho I only thought Product 19 and BamBam were truly
on point.

Lights:  I don't know where the fuck they got this thing but there was the
coolest green laser in the top room.  It shot through a screen and painted
animations and 3d objects all night long.  I cannot possibly stress enough
how damn cool this thing was.  I musta spent at least an hour just
starring dumbly at it and wishing I had one in my room.

People:  I love ya all!!  The cleveland kids were soooo wonderful.  All
the girls were super cute and nice and the boys were very fly and
friendly.  Got so many hugs from so many cute girls and some kid
freestyled to me in the upper room (props to you man, sounded awesome with
that hiphop beat).  Plenty of glowsticks were brought, danced with and
shared.  The highlight of the night had to be the people with their hugs,
backrubs and just generally great attitude.

Drugs:  Face it, even if ya don't do them they are part of every rave.
The way people act are influenced greatly by them and they can make or
break the vibe almost as well as a dj can.  Happy to say the situation was
quite groovy at Cyber Ex.  VERY nice E was going around (elephants) and at
least half the people there were beautifuly, safely and lovingly rolling
their asses off.

The Rest:  This was just a great party.  I have NEVER felt such love at
one event.  I have so much more respect for the cleveland kids.  I got to
see some truly kick ass dj's (tho alas, no carlos).  If anyone was
wondering I was the kid with blond hair and a red t-shirt going around
distributing hugs, flyers and blo-pops.  You might also remember me as the
punk who kept borrowing your glowsticks ;)

Come on party people, we gotta keep this thing going!
jP

Shout Outs:
Erika, Joanna and Blythe - Much love for the ride, company, backrubs and
everything!!  You girls made it all worthwhile.
Sarah, Mischelle and all the other cleveland girls - I loved the hugs and
the happy vibes you brought with you.  Sorry I kept stealing your
glowsticks ;)
Guy Who Sold Me E - Wow!  With a product like that who needs advertising!

I would definitely stay with it.  I mean I like this music and go to
raves to have a good time and forget about everything else, not to try
and be different from everyone else, so it becoming mainstream would in
no way steer me away.  It may suck some, and it may bring some bad things
to the scene, but its the music that matters. (WYEP ?)

straight up... i got to agree with todd on most shit like this, tho.
even though raves can be some genreally shady shit and everyone has
their bone to pick with the scene, what really matters is what you
make of it! there's no reason to be apathetic about it all - just go
have the best time you possibly can even if the scene heads in a
direction that you dont want it to... the only way its headin in your
way is if you are representin whats inside of you.

nothin but love...

The mic was on his pinky, earphone on his index.  The antenna was in his
thumb.  Perhaps it was only in his right hand, I'm trying to dig up hazy
memories of the second season...

Whoever made the suggestion of erasing the Cc's extra addresses was right
on.  I just got three messages, twice each, all one liners about Inspector
Gadget.  I love Gadget and Penny and Brain and Mad Cat as much as the next
kid, but not so much that I want to be reading and re-reading about them
in the same session.  Just a thought.

I think Frankie and Todd's answers are good ones, and i think it all comes
back to the thing that everyone was getting nit picky about, and that is for
example:  the way people dress (i.e. designer clothes), and how specific
people are about what kinda music they like (i.e. love jungle but hate
house).  I think you are a true raver if you go for the music and the vibes.
To all the people who go and stereotype the crowd,  Like the 'plain clothes
people' --people who don't wear baggy pants etc., they need to stop for a
minute and realize why they're their and perhaps think that most everyone is
there for the music.  So don't go trying to pick yourself apart from other
people, trying to figure out who's the 'better raver/person'  because even
though the people may be different, they all have one thing in common, the
love of the music.

okay....now, i may just be on crack, but i dont even think that its all 
about the music....i think its about the release of dancing, being up 
all night, doing drugs, and just having fun.....i personally think that 
races are about the fun atitude and the release......the particular type 
of music really doesnt matter.....actually, i think that raves could be 
better by featuring non-rave music as well....just as long as the 
attitude of the musicians was in line with the attitude/release that is 
the center unifying force of raves.....like woodstock was basically a 
really big rave.....it didnt specifically specialize in any particular 
type of music....but the attitude was there, and the release was 
there...and thats what made it what it was......and i think the same 
applies to raves.....thats what i think

i just have to say that i adore uncle gadget's neice penny.  i think she
is the cutiest bootyest girl ever.

now ... hmmm on to another piece.  i first want to introduce myself ...
i'm david, xspyboy@aol ... i transferred last semester to pitt.  i moved
to nyc and went to college at nyu when i graduated from high school.  i
grew up in pittsburgh.  i'm korean.  i don't really travel for parties, i
just go to some of the local events.  and i don't really know what else to
say, this is just some of the yadda yadda most people ask during
introductions.

but onto something i've been hoping i would get to bring up in a sincere
context - i know that most of you probably don't take these posts
seriously, since a lot of it is just silly bullshit and it requires
somewhat of an investment just to maintain a subscription, considering
some of the irrelevant junk that litters this list ... not to say that i
don't appreciate that irrelevant junk ...

but i'd like to ask ur attention concerning something that has been
disturbing me lately.  i've been personally affected by sexual phobias in
all circles, even in the gay community, and yes even in the rave
community.  i claim to be straight, although it feels to me like it's a
lot more complicated than prefering the opposite sex.  but i'm not gonna
go into that now ...

so um yeah i'm straight.  i'm establishing this so i can provide some kind
of reference ...

i'm having a hard time getting into what i'm trying to say ... 

i have a question.  do you think alternate forms of sexuality are more
accepted in our community than in others?  

i'm often mistaken for a fag.  this is fine with me, cos i admit i
sometimes look effeminate and i'm into ballet, shopping, children,
fashion, hair, makeup ... pastimes which are sometimes considered to be of
special interest to gay men ... but i hate defending my sexuality, i'm
okay with appearing one way or the other because i feel ambiguous and
apathetic about it anyways.

whatever.  i almost decided not to send this letter just now, cos i think
it sounds too serious when it's really not a big deal.  but i'm sending it
anyways.  

i just also want to say that the homophobia in the rave community disgusts
me.  it makes me seriously doubt the sincerity of the plur ethic, that
this scene just uses a smiley front to claim that we're void of the social
injustices which taint the rest of this crazy world.

that's it.  i look forward to any responses or related comments.

love
spyboy

ps does anyone know how i can get in touch with the crew of b-boys who
used to go by jedi monks?  (i'm not sure if they're still in effect or
what)

Yeah, and Brain was the smartest dog ever!

> seriously, 

I don't know about that.  Since you have just come on, you've probably
missed some of our arguements (discussions).  Sometimes we take ourselves
so seriously that we get into incredibly heated discussions over silly
things (i.e. clothing, posing, jungle vs. house, etc.).  Along the way,
however, I've made friends that I correspond with outside of the list.

> i have a question.  do you think alternate forms of sexuality are more
> accepted in our community than in others?  

Because I'm not gay, I can't really say I understand or know, to the full
extent, whether or not alternate forms of sexuality are accepted more so
in the raver community.  I think so.  The only reason I say this is
because when I first started raving, and I'm talking my second party, the
first friends I made were gay.  Even though it sounds like "some of my
best friends are <insert minority>", I've made many, very good friends
that just happened to be gay.  Perhaps I was a sheltered child, because 
for the first time in my life, I encountered young, openly gay people in
the raver community.  It's always seemed to me as if we were an incredibly
accepting group.  Perhaps I'm still being sheltered by my own inability to
recognize any wrong-doing in this seemingly perfect sub-culture.    

> i'm often mistaken for a fag.  

If it makes you feel any better, I'm sometimes mistaken for a boy.  I
even started to cry once, right in the middle of the mall.  I'm 6' tall.
I guess girls don't grow over 5'7".

I totally agree with you that it's not the music alone that makes a rave.
It's the vibe and activities associated, as well.  I don't know, however,
if a rave would be a rave without, as much as some people hate this term,
the various forms of electronica that we all know and love.  I don't know
if this phenomenon could even happen outside of a rave.  Remember the last
Woodstock?  Although some good intentions were involved, so many people
cashed in, selling memorabilia with abandon.  Mtv had a show entirely
devoted to the selling of this memorabilia.  I don't think that raving is
AS capitalist as that.  I think it's the entire experience of good venue,
good vibe, good <insert favorite form of electronica>, that makes up a
party in the form of "rave".

Just a thought,

Hi all

I am doing research on the effects of prolonged ecstasy  (XTC) use.  As part of this
research I have designed a simple questionaire to guage various patterns of use.
 

Please could anyone who has:	
	a) Used ecstasy for more than 12 months and 
	b) Used ecstasy in the last 6 months
please take 5 minutes, and fill in my multiple choice questionaire which can be found
at:

	http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andy_yelland

Thank you for your time, and appologies being slightly off-topic, and for the cross-post.


Catherine Norman

P.S if there is demand I could put the results up on the net at a later date.

Well if it's different music you guys want for raves, then maybe you should
try to book Towa Tei!  That guy is the shit.  Anyone get his new album?
It's really great, it even has a song with Biz Markie on it!

My thoughts are that alternative lifestyles are more accepted, but its
like that "dont ask, dont tell" kinda thing.  Just a thought...

With wonderfully descriptive information like this being posted to
public mailing lists on the world's largest network, does anyone
truly wonder why it's hard to get spaces, respect or fair media
representation?

Use your heads, people.  When you click on "send", think of where
your message is going.  Where's it being forwarded.  Who's reading
it.  It's all archived, searchable and more-or-less permanent.

In other words, be responsible... in what information you provide...
...and retain.

While I'v never been to one, I get the impression that Greatful Dead shows
had a very rave-like vibe to them.  Lots of 'multimedia' aspects to it,
plus an indescriabable vibe.  Personally I never liked their music, but I
can appriciate what they did. :)

My overall experience is that 'alternate forms of sexuality' are more
accepted in the rave scene.  I guess its somewhat 'don't ask, don't
tell, don't care', but i think even then, people just aren't so catty
about someone being 'gay' as they are in mainstream america.  Alot of
folks even trace the us scene back to primarily 'gay' warehouse parties of
the late 80's.

Still, there are those ill people that will find something wrong with you
no matter what 'scene' you're in.  Poop on that!

To all:
      Has anyone looked in the Feb 25th issue of  "In Pittsburgh"?  There's a
small article in it about Hypersonics....AND....there's even a smaller article
about entitled "New Cru"  

       From what I've gathered, there's a collaboration of DJ's called "The
Amoeba In-Flight Cru" that spins/composes music at Zythos over on Carson.
I've never heard of this before and was curious if anyone has any info on it? 

Thanks
Jason

I didn't go to this, but I think it was on sat (the 28th), and is maybe
going to be a weekly thing?  Sounded more like a one-time thing, because
it was being advertised as "these cool ny junglists" (according to manny,
the author of sed article).  

I'd like to see them, coz i never heard of them before, but i think it was
a one-time thing on the ill-jungle/ambient kina tip. ???  anyone go?

I cant picture how they can enforce this. There is no reason for someone
under 21 to really 'need' an id. Especially in pgh where most locals
dont have cars.

As for the reason. As i have often heard, it is because of the alcohol.
They make their most money off of the alcohol. (Hence why its a 5$ door
charge instead of the typical 5$ under 21, 2$ over.) Making the club 18+
ensures a 'mature' atmosphere, which will attrack more 21+s to drink. It
also gives them a little leeway in what they actually define as 21.  I
was 21 at laga since I was 19 :).  
In short. Alcohol sucks as allways. :)

I like to think that the rave culture is more accepting w/ the alternative
lifestyle. I might think differently if I were gay/bi. Cause then I guess I
would notice the phobias a little bit more..but I doubt it. I had this very
dicussion w/ a bi male on Sat and he also feels that the rave community is
accepting. He felt comfortable being bi and being open about it at a rave, and
a rave is the only place ( besides being w/ close friends ) where he is
comfortable about being open w/ his sexuality. His exact words were "raver
kids are open minded". The more I think about that statement the more I think
it is true.. The next time someone ask you if you are gay, ask them if it
matters one way or the other...hear what they have to say, cause I am curious
about why they would even ask you in the first place. 

Love, Amy

>> accepted in our community than in others?  


I think most ravers have good intentions of being non-homophobic and or
at least put up a good front.  The thing is.. most of us (midwestern,
anyway) queers spent a couple-a teenage  years dealing with our
sexuality, so we tend to be more perceptive to people's
uncomfortable-ness on the issue.  I think that since most party kids are
straight, being queer will always leave you slightly on the outside...
that's just how it  always is though, unless u wanna immerse yourself in
the "gay community", which I have nothing good to say about (ahem...
blatant racism and heterophobia). 

hmmm... I could prolly write a book on this issue, but, ugh, why am I
thinking about this?
Oh...this is my first post on this list, I usu just lurk here, but I had
a few xtra minutes today and since I used to spend too much time thinking
about this kinda stuff as a youngster, I thought I'd add my 2 cents.  :-P
  Hi, my name is Phil.

peace and love, y'all
Phil

Not sure about the situation in pittsburgh as noone seems to know who is
gay at raves (doesn't seem to be an issue at all).  In seattle there is a
definate section of the candy-raver population that is outwardly gay.
They constitute some of the best dancers in seattle (I know one kid who is
AMAZING with a pair of glowsticks in hand) and they seem to be an
essential part of the raving community.  I'd like to think that noone
gives a fuck in the raving community if your young/old, black/white or
gay/straight and for the most part I think this is true.

Hey There,

If you are attending this year's Winter Music Conference in Miami, Florida
March 7 - 11, make sure to stop by and meet your fellow net-ravers from
around the world at the.....

Winter Music Cyber-Tribe Netogether
When: 6:00 PM, Sunday evening, March 8, 1998
Where: At the Gazebo on the Public Beach just north of the Eden Roc Hotel,
Miami

The Netogether is scheduled to begin at 6 PM, immediately following WMC's
panel on the rave sub-culture. The Netogether is free with plenty of
parking available, and because it's on the public beach, everyone is
invited whether or not you are a registered conference participant. 

The public beach is just north of the Eden Roc hotel, which is right next
to the Fountainbleu where the WMC conference is being held. Just look on
the gazebo for the Cyber-tribe Netogether sign and smiling peeps
underneath. There will be some music and munchies and plenty of lively
conversation. 

In this period of oppressive "Stop The Raves" thinking, the Internet has
been instrumental in allowing us to nurture and care for our collective
rave culture. Come out and meet in person the people that work hard to keep
raves and their positive values, attitudes, and beliefs alive - YOU! If you
want to find friends and acquaintances, the netogether is the perfect place
to meet. I hope to meet many of you there. :-)

Errrrrrrrhhhhhhhhh! Stop the ride.  You took it one step too far there. 
The music is what truely takes the experience to the next level.  I mean
you can't get the type of vibe you get on a dance floor of people dancing
to some deep house or trance that you can with a band on stage and some
guy screaming about how he hasn't gotten laid in a month or how he is a
heroin addict.  It just isn't the same.  It is about the release, because
of the fact that there aren't anywords, and the few that there are are
about getting funky adn other crazy ass shit.  And you can't get that
same vibe without the lights, smoke, lasers speakers and all that other
good stuff.  It just would not be the same.

A humorous note: I was explaining to someone what a rave was (people
staying up all night dancing and taking drugs) and after everything was
said and done he said, "Black people have been doing that for years . . .
its called a house party."  
:)

ya know, being a proud user of ecstacy for years now i clicked the
link below with the intention of filling out the survey.  but then i
started to wonder whether the page was, like, reading my cookies and
the data being stored on some fbi mainframe somewhere.  i mean, data
sent over the web is _not_ particularly anonymous.

or maybe prolonged use of ecstacy just causes paranoia...

well i hate to burst your bubble, my dear fellow SFRaver but...

if you were paranoid about this person being an authoratative figure, such
as the FBI, or internet-NARCS.. They're on this list, as they obviously
posted to it.. So you just DAMNED yourself, and are in their files as a
"proud ecstacy user" forever -- SFRaves for one, archives their list and
makes it accessable to any user.

thought i'd cross-post this as just a thought, before any of you ever open
your mouth on drug usage,
especially if you're the paranoid type...

Not _exactly_ the same, but very similar.

If you get a bunch of people on a dance floor who don't like house
or trance on your hypothetical dance floor and you'll get a vibe
alright... a bad one.  :)

Not all bands feature guys screaming about sex and drugs, either.
That's a pretty narrow stereotype.

But it _is_ about the release.  And if that release is at a rave, a
punk rock show, a big concert, or in front of a drum circle at a
Rainbow Gathering... it's still a release.  Wherever you have a
group of people that are really really into something and they're
all feeling positive and emotional and into some sort of unifying
groove I don't think the music, venue, lights, fog or anything else
really matters.

Positive energy/vibrations/whatever are universal.  It's what
originally brought us all together around that drum in that cave,
listening to Jimi create some magic in that mudsoaked field in the
60's, or when Richie Hawtin played live for the first time in that
sweat-soaked black-plastic box called Spastik...

...and hopefully, will never stop.

	pHryL. would also like to share our excitement in booking the
Majesty
	Records tour for our may 30th project entitled "forward."


	techno area:

	JOEY BELTRAM [nyc]                                           
	Rather than banging out tracks, Joey nurtures each production -

	the end result is music that is constantly favored and imitated
by                                      
	producers worldwide. Joey breaks down barriers in dance music'

	further escalating the buzz around his presence as an innovator
in
	techno.                                            
	                                           
	MIKE DEARBORN [chicago]

	blistering set of techno

	                                           
	STEVE STOLL -live [nyc]

	The blunted boy wonder. On the surface his sound is down the
line                                          
	New York techno; stripped down, minimal and direct, but Stoll

	refuses to be pigeonholed with his music squirming and twisting
out                                          
	of any rigid genre stereotypes

	DJ SKULL [chicago]                                           
	Spinning chicago house, detroit techno and a blend of some of
the                                          
	best underground, Skull has played some of the world's biggest

	festivals. Best known for his work on DJAX, Skull has profoundly

	influenced the global techno/house scene.

	in the drum n bass room:

	                                           
	FIERCE [No U-turn, Prototype, UK]
	first Canadian appearance by the hard-core teenager considered
to                                          
	be Doc Scott's favourite DJ. He produced Crystal and co-produced

	Proton with Nico on the Torque album. Fierce's funky, dark

well, laura, you've been on sfraves as long as i can remember (ie
several months - does x affect long term memory?) so you might have
noticed that i tend to blab away about doing drugs "on stage" all the
time.  certainly this post isn't the first.  foolish?  very probably,
though the idea is that i have an anonymous account on a huge e-mail
server with no accurate info about myself on file (not the same as an
aol account paid for by credit card, though still possibly traceable
if you dug _really_ deep).  not everybody who saw that post and
thought about answering it could say the same, i was really just
raising the question publicly rather than trying to protect myself. 
as for me, you might have noticed i'm not really particularly shy
about sharing the lurid details of my life with perfect strangers -
that's just the way i am.  just be glad i've managed to keep my mouth
shut about the details of my wild sex life ;)

-messiah

ps andy if you're just some guy interested in studying what you say
you are, well, sorry about calling your motives into question.  but i
couldn't help but wonder...

I HIGHly doubt that this persin is a narc...and if they is...who
cares...there isnt much they can do just because you said you did
e...answer the questions...they will not do anything...but if they ask
stuff like prices u pay...or if u would hook them up with your
dealer...or how you find your dealers...then just dont answer stuff
like that...we are all smart ppl...we should know which questions are
incriminating and which arent...

I replied to an e-mail regarding a similiar XTC related research project
going on in Maryland. I contacted the women in the retailed e-mail and
spoked to her on the telephone. She was legitiment and their research was
regarding mdma's long term affects (depression, moodiness, lack of
appetite). The rearch sounded very interesting and I wanted to do it. But
unfortunately A) they wanted to do a spinal tap B) I'm prone to
depression. Therefore I couldn't be a subject. Oh well. I wanted to give
myself to this experiment and allow myself to experience the pain of the
spinal tap... because I want to give something back to the scene. Even
more than I try to on a regular basis. 

I think if someoen was interested in busting us for discussing drugs and
using them, they could very well do this. Simply manipulate us warm
hearted ravers and offer a dinner of some sorts... loor (sp?) us in and
get us... but I don't think that is the true intent.

It's so beautiful today. Sigh... Dreamy....  *:)

 This just in: NEW VIRUS WARNING
  If you receive an e-mail with a subject line of "Badtimes," delete it
  immediately WITHOUT reading it. This is the most dangerous E- mail
  virus yet.

  It will completely re-write your hard drive. Not only that, but it
  will scramble any disks that are even close to your computer. It also
  demagnetizes the strips on all your credit cards, reprograms your ATM
  access code, screws up the tracking on your VCR and uses subspace
  field harmonics to scratch any CDs you try to play

  It will recalibrate your refrigerator's coolness setting so all your
  ice cream melts and your milk curdles. It will give your ex-boy/girlfriend
  your new phone number.

  This virus will mix antifreeze into your fish tank. It will drink all
  your soda and leave dirty socks on the coffee table when you are
  expecting company. It will hide your car keys when you are late for
  work and interfere with your car radio so that you hear only static
  while stuck in traffic.

  When executed "Badtimes" will also give you nightmares about circus
  midgets.

  It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine.
  "Badtimes" will give you Dutch Elm disease and brown patch. If the
  "Badtimes" mail message is opened in a Windows 95 environment it will
  leave the toilet seat up and leave your hairdryer plugged in
  dangerously close to a full bathtub. It will not only remove the
  forbidden tags from your mattresses and pillows, but it will also
  refill your skim milk with whole milk.

  It is insidious and subtle. It is dangerous and terrifying to behold.
  It is also a rather interesting shade of mauve.

  These are just a few signs.

  Be afraid. Be very, very afraid.

i remember that sugar beet thing on sesame street, that was cool. i liked
that pinball cartoon that goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. but when i was
5 years old or whatever, i had never seen a pinball machine before, so i
didn't know what it was, which made it kind of abstract. those numbers
would make a neat sample. i also remember this part of sesame street that
was totally abstract + had these colored revolving shapes and electronic
music. those were the best parts of the show. maybe that is why i like
techno now. =] also there was this one cartoon on it where this little boy
was riding his tricycle + got lost then this hand with a yo-yo appears in
the air, then the rest of the person appears who is this guy dressed up
really strange. the boy asked him how to get home + the man says "try to
remember everything you passed, but make the first thing the last". so the
boy thinks of all the things he passed + there was this weird fountain and
a futuristic house that looked like a spaceship and a couple of other
things + he goes home. that cartoon was trippy. i'm trying to collect all
these things on videotape, but everytime i see sesame street lately, the
stuff on it is really dumb, + not psychedelic anymore at all. =/

yeah i'm doing that found-object jewelry thing too. i stretched the holes
in my earlobes to the size of straws + put pieces of clear straw in them.
very minimal, and economical. it looks like my ears have been hit with a
hole punch. =] for a while i had this necklace that was a short thick
chrome chain i got from the hardware store, but then it got tarnished +
rubbed off onto my skin, so i can't wear it anymore. i also had this
pin-like thing i found the same size as the barbell in my tongue piercing
so i traded them but it was too sharp so i put the original barbell back
in.

if i were to have the transprotation, i would definitely be there,
wherever you're talking about (i don't even know where you're talking
about). i love sailor moon. sailor uranus is my favorite sailor. you
should have all the sailors in the movies, inner + outer planets. the
only times i've seen it on tv here, there's just inner planets, i think
that is the americanized version.

Depends on yer email client... for Microsoft Outlook it's not hard to
imagine HTML with an embedded activex control... ActiveX has free reign on
yer system, not like java running in some virtual machine.

yeah - its definitely been going down hill since they changed the
opening and closing sequences to a 90's feel. all sortsa little kids
dancing around to cheesy rap-type music :(

how about:

well, you have to dl a small number of tasks to prove that you are 
worthy to unsubscribe...
1. stand on your head, drink a full bottle of ketchup while reciting the 
alpabet backwards.
2.mail a live sea trout to the pope.
3.buy the new green day album.
4.at 12 midnight, place a dead rat on top of your monitor and chant "we 
must, we must, we must increase our busts." for 6 straight hours.
5.find someone who actually knows what theyre talking about, and ask 
them how to do it.
your welcome,

Um, that virus warning is utter bull.
It's a chain letter, by forwarding it to everyone, and cross-posting it to
irrelevant mailing lists (we want to hear rave related stuff, not this
crap), people cause network problems.

Humanity is the virus.

     I've thought about this statement quite a bit.  I don't want to
get into too deeply because I'm at work and just about ready to get
out of here, BUT when I'm in some of my darker moods, you might say, I
sometimes think about us (humankind) and our creations.  Sometimes I
feel like we're comparable to a form of cancer, with humankind being
these crazy cancer cells building our giant tumors across the earth. 
The cities we create, the fog that surrounds them, and our leacherous
blacktop that covers our poor Mother's skin (concrete covering
ground).  It seems like we're going to continue to do this until her
disease defense mechanisms kick in good and hard, and she eventually
shake's us off (earthquakes) and washes us away (floods).

     Okay, so I can't always look at the bright side... well, yeah I
can.  I guess that whole process would be Mother Earth healing
herself, and in the bigger picture, we ain't shit, so why would we
expect anything less?

Meanwhile you sit in front of a computer typing a message.

The computer is essentially made of silicon, metal and plastic.

The processing of each of these contributes to this earth cancer bullshit
that you speak of.  

Generating the electricity that runs your computer and your turntable so you
can listen to your beloved electronic music contributes to the fog and
smog in the cites.

So what is  your point???????

Please waste more energy causing more smog with these matters.  I know that
I caused smog by typing this message, but this needed to be said.

Sorry to hear about your darker mood.....I am going to kick my own ass now
for putting you in a bad mood, since I am human and to contribute to this
foolishness.

hello:

i think someone had posted this before.  everyone ookmark it.

http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html

it tells you about virii hoaxes and it's run by the dept of energy (so it
can't be wrong!)  this will, over time, increase the productivity and
efficiency of the pbcle.  at the first sign of a virus hoax we can all check
our facts and tell the hoax-messenger to "hold up" or "ahh ahhh ahhhhh" --
or completely ignore the messenger because WE KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS, sheeit.

hoping to see the day when pbcle reaches optimal discussion flow,
Andrew

Does anyone remember the one with the ballerina wearing black (fishnets,
tutu, etc) and the early break dancer in shorts, hightops, and leather
jacket?  He would dance his way and she would dance her way to electronic
music and they did lifts.  It's really cool.

Get a life Andy.  We're pretty much friends here, or at least
friendly.  Some of us post a lot and some of us hang back and just
read without responding.  Very often, we get entirely off the subject of 
raves exclusive.  We do this because it is of interest to the majority
of the group.  If this isn't in your interest, ignore it and wait for an 
exclusive rave posting.  If this isn't the kind of list you want to be
on, go somewhere else.  Some of us value Tom's opinions even when we don't
agree with them.  Some of us value everyone's opinions even when we don't
agree with them.  If this is your first post, I can't really say you've
started out on the right foot.  Disagreement is very different from out
and out offense.  YOU offend me.

I would just like to apologize for jumping down the throat of the
big-headed Andy.  Perhaps, however, everyone on the list should feel
special that I would jump to their defense at the sound of attack...hmm?

Just a thought,

I know i'm a little behind on this one but can i just say that i love love
love love old school seasame street?  i haven't seen an episode in a loooonng
time but i have so many fond memories of the old school series.  i was
babysitting some kids earlier last year and they were watching it.  I was
getting all happy and excited expecting what i had grown up with.  Let me just
say, parts of it were definitely from the series that taught me how to read
but the majority of it was crap.  you read and hear all this stuff about how
the younger generations' attention spans are shortening-it was obvious in
seasame street.  i guess the kids of today would get bored with what i found
fascinating thirteen or fourteen years ago.  that typewriter head guy just
brought back floods of memories.  Does anyone remember that little film clip
they had about kittens drinking milk?  all the while in the background,
there's this little girl singing "Milk, milk, milk..." over and over again.
one of my girlfriends told me that when she saw that, she always cried because
she thought the girl sounded "soooo sad!"  And does anyone remember the operas
that Mr. Roger's used to have in the Land of Make Believe?  Man, old school tv
shows rock my world.  :D
much love,
  sharon

just a quick word about all this....
the only thing i have figured out so far to stop these is to close the list
so only members can post.  that means that if someone is subbed as
asdf@bung.hole.com and the mail goes out as asdf+@bung.hole.com or
asdf@mailer1.bung.hole.com they get bounced.  i close the list on and off,
usually time permitting,  i kept it closed for awhile and no junk was
coming in, the second i opened it.   ....  BLAM,,,, we get nailed....
i'll prolly close it again this week,  oh well....  just been busy with
skool and have it opened up to spare my inboxes....
it seems the list is getting hit hard lately by ppl selling mixtapes, the
ppl in florida, nashville, nyc, and ct posting their parties.  they always
do, even when its closed up.
the worst recently mixtapes@sandersnet subbed to the list and other
rave-lists, trolled it for email addresses and sent spam out to everyone
they could find, bypassing closed mailing lists and what not.   _sigh_
trouty.

cool beans....its not cool to be elitist, but i dont think thats the 
case here......hmmm...might there be a way to make the closing of the 
list a little less stringent??? maybe like just add a * to the blocked 
lists or whatever...i have no idea what im talking about, but if sumone 
knows what i mean and knows how to do it i think that would be a good 
idea, that way there wont be so much crap email from nonlist 
members....but of course, us list members can post all the crap we 
please;)

	I have been wondering if the listserver has the ability to prune
out any emails that cross-post to any or all of the other rave lists. 
That way, at least the spammers will get blisters on their fingers from
tediously sending their crap to each of the lists. 
	Is there anyone out there (especially Trout) that haqs a clue
'bout such things?

If you don't like it, why don't YOU just unsub?  You haven't the power to
pick and choose who's on this list.  If you don't like it, tough noogies,
pal.  This is the way we are now.  I think our dynamics keep changing with
who is on the list.  Besides, do you really think that anyone who sees
their name will be prompted to unsub and bow down to your royal request?
I won't.

yo, is that the one where some girl is roommates with a dj in NYC?  She
tries to be a librarian but seems to spend most of her time planning
raves, getting drunk and trying to make out with some ukranian hotdog
vendor.  I saw it on hbo and LOVED it.  Didn't know the name but they kept
playing this song that went "party girl, lalala, partygirl!" or something
like that.

pEace,

Adam........it's a piece of cake!  I have software that is designed for mass
emailing (I don't use it:)  But I have tons of different programs.  And with
the mass emailing ones, the way they work is like this............You run a
program....enter in some keywords "rave mailing lists"  And what the program
does is searches the entire internet for those words.....When they are found,
peoples email addresses are easily extracted from the server or from postings.

It how alot of people get junk email.  They simply join a list like
this......someone finds the list and extracts the addresses.....and POOOF!   A
direct connection to any "raver" mail box:)     

Hope this helps

Jason

PS.....as for "pruning"  it is possible.  When the addresses are collected, a
"remove list" can be made.  People on the "remove list" are.....well....you
guessed it:)  REMOVED!    thats why with this list all you have to do is send
a letter saying "unsubscribe" and then you're off.  The mailing program scans
the mail looking for that word in the subject heading.    And when it's
found......you're put into the "remove list" and they don't send mail to you
anymore!

Has anyone seen this movie:

	I don't remember the name of it, but it was about these three
girls who go to underground warehouse parties.  One of them is a
drug-using girlfriend of a popular ass-hole dj.  The other one has a crush
on an '80s rockstar who meets her and then has a crush on her.  The
djgirlfriend works at a petstore, a guy buys a kitten and then asks her
out.  She forgets and goes to the party.  The friends take him with them
to the party.  The party gets busted and the girls and the boy escape
without being arrest.  There are then hijinx to find the girlfriend,
because she's on something and she was dumped and might be suicidal.  At
one point, I remember then smoking pastel colored cigarettes, that I found
intriguing even though I don't smoke.  Then they try to find the rock star
because the girl loves him and he loves her, more hijinx.  Everything is
resolved and the sun comes up.  

Any ideas?

Yeah.  I didn't think it was that bad, but what really confused me was how
clubbing can become a way of life.

I meant no disrespect to anyone, but I'm curious:  How can you make a life
out of clubbing?

its your opinion that those things have nothing to do with the scene ...
others feel that they are relevent topics ... I would have to agree with the
later as I can think of at least 2 tracks based on those shows ;)

Eye candy for raves.

Do you have any nifty ideas?

Just out of curiosity, anyone seen C'thugha for Winamp?  It rocks all
known sheep.

 its your opinion that those things have nothing to do with the scene ...
 others feel that they are relevent topics ... I would have to agree with the

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  no wonder the "scene" hasn't hit full potential

Sure there are samples of things floating around.  But com'on!!!!!!   Maybe
I'm being a bit harsh but.....I'm on a few other mailing lists which tends to
hold me back from reading as many posts as I'd like to.    And when I do read
posts from this list it seems that people are either fighting or talking
striaght bullshit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Where's the talk about........THE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Let's start talking about some good DJ's/Live PA's
Lets start talking about where some good sites to hold an event would be
Lets start talking about new and up coming acts!
Lets talk about new sounds and subcultures of "the rave scene" 

Like I said before.......maybe I'm being harsh.......BUT..........to
me......this scene means alot more than some big yellow bird and some half ass
inspector!

Much Love

Otay, I wasn't going to post anything for a while but I have become much much to bored today, and must do 
something. -)
	This is my first post so firstly, I would like to offer a massively huge HELLO and a big 
cyber-hug to you all. I just moved to the area about a month or so ago. The main reason i'm even on this list 
is 'cause i went to YAHOO awhile back in my hometown of Rochester and experienced some of the bestist vibes 
and vowed to myself that I shall join a mailing-list such as this. And I finally got the internet down here 
so here I am. The reason my grey matter is so bored is 'cause i have nothing to do (ie no school, no job 
yet). I've been to 2 parties down here in the pb-cle area so far, both of which i had phun at even though i 
went to one by myself <sniffle>, but then i guess what gathering wouldn't be any happihappi funky fresh phun. 
I suppose thats all I have to say right now just wanted to introduce. 
	Ohhh with all this Sesame Street talk i have to add to it. I found out that the show is on 3 times a 
day down here, morning afternoon and evening. Coincidence that the show is on during breakfast lunch and 
dinner times, I think not. Everyone knows Snuffalufagus helps food digestion. To keep this rave related 
though, does anyone remember that track "Sesame's Treet" by the Smart E's from back in '92, i think?anyone? 
and yeah i've seen that "party girl" movie back when I saw it I got a crush on Parker Posey from the movie, 
tee hee. 
	To help me better understand where people stand on this list answer this question for me please, i'll 
give you a blow pop when I see ya!! -) If you owned and operated a space craft what planet/moon/galaxy/nebula 
etc. would you visit? and what beats would you play on your journey? thank you!!
That is all, mind the babble, pleasssseee!!  -)
Oh and if you get this far i'm a robot, really!!.........

But we DO talk about the music!  We DO talk about the djs and live pa's.
We DO talk about good venues and new acts and new sounds and subculture!
Then we complain about how we're getting so serious and someone brings
something up to make us all laugh.  As I recall, that might have been how
the Sesame Street thing was brought up.  And as far are relevancy goes,
Sesame Street and Inspector Gadget and Voltron were a part of our
childhood.  Is it really so bad to reminisce?  (although I will admit
sometimes we do take it a bit far)  Is it really so bad to have a rotten
day and come back to something that makes you giggle just a little bit?
I think maybe you're being a little harsh!

ok, you said it yourself..part of the _culture_.  raver "culture," like 
it or not includes what we do when we're not at a party, 
listening/dancing to some kick ass dj or some live PA.  i mean, the 
culture of extinct peoples doesn't just mean the tombs or the artwork 
they left behind.  it includes how they lived their daily lives, and for 
some of us, cartoons and old school pbs shows are part of our daily 
lives.  and for some of us, our daily lives don't include those things.  

the reality of being a raver is that we are a diverse as hell bunch.  in 
the same week, i may go to a punk show and a rave.  a lot of us go to 
school. a lot of us hold real jobs.  there's really no reason to pick on 
those people that are telling us what they like to do/watch during the 
time outside of a party (well, within reason of course :), especially if 
it can get _some_ type of agreement between people who have lately been 
ripping each other apart.

as for the "childish posts" i don't think that anything can be more 
childish than being mean to people you don't know that haven't done 
anything to you.   there is such a thing as _constructive criticism_ 
that critiques, but doesn't insult or demean or degrade.  it's something 
that everyone on this list (including me) could try and teach 
themselves.  but that's just my opinion, humble as it may be.





>Like I said before.......maybe I'm being harsh.......BUT..........to
>me......this scene means alot more than some big yellow bird and some 
half ass
>inspector!

yes, the scene _is_ much more than Big Bird and Inspector Gadget and 
stuffed Elmo's in back pockets, but they are all _parts_ of the scene, 
making up the whole.




k bye =)

Hey kids, I thought the whole thing was about what makes you feel 
good...The people, the music, the scene, EVERYTHING.  Why don't we stop 
with all this bitchiness, let people groove on whatever they wanna and 
mind our own...

                          *hugs*

|have any of you guys ever seen the movie "party girl"? just
|wonderin...its a good film...starring the oh-so-luscious parker
|posey...hehe


hey!  i was afraid to tell people about that movie er maybe i didn't have
anyone that would descend enough to respond to that type of movie in my
school "friend bank".  it was a great movie; it reflects how i feel now as
seventeen yr old ['just fuck it, nancy'].  i felt good for her when she
stayed up all night reading about the dewey decimal system.  i stayed up to
watch that movie on HBO one schoolnight, & it made me so apathetic that i
didn't go to school the next day.

that dj played house; but it was diluted house.

	To me, this list means a lot more than just talking about events and the
music.  I guess I see it as a forum for 'us' having a common bond with the
music we love being able to talk about ANYTHING.
	Lets see if this makes sense (I'm a bit of a scattered-rambler),
whether you want to call this a sub-culture, underground, or
whatever...the fact is that the majority of people DON'T listen to this
music we love, can't let themselves let loose in a club, etc...so I ENJOY
to opprotunity to discuss anything  with these people {The pb-cle list}
cuz I think it's just cool to b.s. with people with alike interests.

Just an opinion that prolly made no sense...hugz around,

Just a reminder that the Inaudible radio/webcast is broadcasting
all the latest and greatest techno & house music tonight from 
9-11 pm eastern standard time. On this week's show you can
expect to hear new music from Dan Curtin & Mike Filly, Russ
Gabriel, Ian O'Brien, Danny Wang, CiM, Joe Louis, Theo Parish, 
Mark Broom, Pole and Wier to name a few. 

During the Inaudible show we will be giving away promo 12"s 
and cds so yet another reason to tune in. The week you could
win a classic comp 12" from Plug Research, an Abacus 12" from
the Guidance, a Porter Ricks 12" from Force Inc or the new
Mills 12" from Axis.

The show will be accessible by visiting WCSB 89.3 FM for
those in the cleveland area. For those people out of the area
can listen over the internet by visiting http://www.wcsb.org
every Wednesday from 9-11 pm EST. The show will be broad-
cast in the AudioActive format (which is actually much
better than RealAudio). You can download the Audio Active
plugin for free at http://www.audioactive.com/player/

> Hey cleveland, I need help :)  I need to find some record stores, and

> (well, anywhere that's anywhere near cleveland would be ok too ;)  

the only ones i know of in cleveland are grand poobah's + bent crayon. i
haven't been inside grand poobah's since it was closed + from the outside
it looks like they have a lot of club-style house...like they had
something by ru paul sitting in the window. bent crayon has a good deal of
techno, particularly experimental stuff, they might have some techstep too
but i wasn't looking for that so i didn't notice. they don't have any
house whatsoever. they have a lot of punk + industrial types of records
kind of mixed in with the techno which was kind of annoying. and their
turntable wasn't working when i was there. i got a record there by todd
sines (it has backdoor, superuser, + i think the other 2 tracks are called
modulator or something), which i like a lot, and the downshifter ep by
t-1000. they are both located on detroit rd. in cleveland on the west
side, near the phantasy theatre. bent crayon is on the right + grand
poobah's is across the street about 1 block west.

i would also highly recommend submerge in detroit. you can mail order from
them. their www address is http://www.submerge.com. i have ordered stuff
from them twice and they have friendly service + send your order pretty
fast, and include flyers and stickers (transmat and underground
resistance so far...woohoo!). their store has the best selection of techno
i have seen anywhere, also they have mixtapes by dj assault, (!) i just
got one + there are more than 100 tracks crammed onto it and his mixing is
near perfect. =]

but if you're just looking for jungle, i'm not sure where the best place
to get it would be. you should probably ask somebody in pittsburgh for
that.

for all you pittsburghers ... 

the building on fifth ave in oakland next
door to central catholic is where wqed-fm, wqed-tv, wqex-tv, and
pittsburgh magazine are all headquartered, so you migh wanna check it out
sometime, it's usually got someone interesting or at least locally famous
lurking ... 

also that's where they used to film mister rogers'
neighborhood, and most of the set just sits in the hallways getting dusty
... they have the big clock where daniel lion used to live, the
merry-go-round where lady elaine fairchild used to live, the tree where x
the owl used to live, also i think henrietta pussycat used to live there
too, and the castle where king friday the thirteenth and prince saturday
the fourteenth used to live, and that weird factory where some chipmunk
used to live is out there ... that was the status of their historical
preservation efforts when i used to work there three years ago, i guess
they were having some problems with storage area

mister rogers is special to me - purple panda scared me but i used to go
to church with mister rogers until i was like six, and i had an enormous
crush on lady aberline, and i had an autographed 8x10 glossy of mister
mcpheely ... but it's not very much fun to watch anymore, not nearly as
much fun as cartoons and sesame street.  mebby cos it's more about
education than entertainment ...

speedy delivery
spyboy david

ps to anyone who is considering complaining that these posts about kiddy
shows and video games are not rave-related ... i say pooh to you, it's a
lot more fun than arguing about dkny, househeads vs jungleheads, or
east coast vs west coast

about mister rogers neighborhood ...

fun!  thunder thunder thunder thundercats - HO!!! 

if you only want to talk about electonic music, drugs, and where you can
get it ... mebby you can get a life first ... 

whoa that was harsh!!! sorry but i just play around when i get into this
forum.

Agreed :) At least mix-tapes have something to do with raves, and out of
state partys do too.. heh I never saw inspector gadget, but if I ever wanted
to know about him I'd subscribe to the Inspector gadget mailing list. Ditto
for sessamee street.

i think so, although i don't agree with your wording. i've heard some
theories that some people are born exclusively heterosexual or homosexual
but most people are bisexual, then society tells subconciously to deny
that, + they end up straight in outward actions + the feelings they know
consciously. so if it wasn't for narrow-mindedness in most of society,
most of us would be bisexual. i think that is where things are moving
(slowly). so "alternate forms" would be gay or straight. but saying
"alternate" inplies one is normal + others are not, which is of course not
true.

 *another massive snip*

We are a diverse bunch, that's why if all of us talked about our own
semi-rave interests, or out-side of raving interests this mailing list would
be huge... I think what's happening now is a couple of people telling us

     If you're interested in rave-like subcultures, I most highly 
recommend a video called "The Pink Floyd Live in London, 66-67".   If 
anything, don't let the fact that it's The Pink Floyd and it's from "The 
Sixties" deter you from open-mindedly giving it a chance.  
     The Pink Floyd started as a creation of Syd Barrett.  Syd came up 
with the name and wrote almost all of the songs.  Then, as the legend 
goes, he got so fucked up from overuse of multiple substances and got so 
fed up with his band members for wanting to make it big, he started to 
not do what was expected of him as a band member.  He wouldn't show up 
for gigs and, when he did, he didn't always play his songs in the way 
that his band members wanted.  So, Waters, Mason, and Wright kicked him 
out of his OWN band and brought in Gilmour as a replacement.  I'm just 
warning you not to let the stuff of The Pink Floyd's you might hear on 
the radio prejudice you against Syd's music.
     Furthermore, "psychedelia", as it was originally defined in 
England, was totally different from that into which America turned it.      
Here are some similarities I see between rave culture and the ENGLISH 
psychedelic underground:

     - All night parties with titles (e.g. The 14-hour Technicolor           
Dream)
     - Intelligent lighting (Peter Whitehead, who put together the           
above-mentioned video, was one of the first to do some of             
the things with and have some of the approaches to lighting           
that we take for granted today.)
     - the aesthetic idea of the futuristic  
     - the philosophy of the "sensory experience"
     - The use of state-of-the-art technology
     - a Paganistic approach to dance
     
     Really, I'm a relative newcomer to the Rave scene.  What drew me to 
it was the fact that it was so similar to English psychedelia, the scene 
that I most love.  Just check out this video!  Sorry to proseletize so 
much but maybe you can forgive me when you see how great this scene was.

                                               Aaron

presently the list is closed.  here is my reasoning for it, since there
is much discussion about it:
1) ppl like dj hardware, posting 2-3x a week about mixtapes, bookings, and 
   whatever.  for those that remember this happening.
2) ppl like icu promotions, who post overpriced-weekly club events in NYC
   every week.
3) the massive crossposts that flared up this week.
4) people selling glo-sticks and such on here.
5) frat parties in california with no real dj's being posted here. very
   repeatedly

these have all happened along with tons of others.  dont want this list to
be a selling ground / advertisement list for every promoter/entrepenuer to
conveniently peddle their wares.  unless alot of people feel differently
about this i really have no intentions of changing my thinking on this.

what is see happening more and more is that ppl are going to hyperreal and
gathering the addresses of all the rave mailing lists and mailing out to
all of them, regardless of content or relevance, just to make a few bucks
or whatever.  if they want to do it, at least have the decency to
subscribe and see whats going on.

the only reason i have for not keeping the list closed to subscribers is
some have multiple mailing addresses and the ones not subbed will bounce,
if i know of the other addresses i can add them to a permitted-to-post
files and the majordomo will allow them to post.

as for the digest i believe it can be set up from withing the majordomo,
not sure on this.  is there a demand for a digest version?  i can ask
around at hyperreal about it.????

thems the faq's ma'am  ....  trouty.

dag, it's been awhile since y'allz seen an official stevie t review 
hasn't it?

perhaps it's time...

DETONATION - 2/29/98 - Cleveland, OH
-----------------------------------

PRE-PARTY BS - i dunno if it's a ravah ting or what, but i guess it's
physically impossible for ravahs to be on time...we scheduled to be
outta columbus by 9pm, but didn't get outta cow-town 'til like 10pm!
despite andrea's wreckless driving, which sporadically fluctuated
from speeds of 60mph to 90mph!!, da porn cru (amy funkybizz, sharon
s kim67678, brent kingleo77, corey ravasaurus, jared dj thrilla,
andrea, myself, and later ehren) arrived fashionably late...arriving in da 
216 around 12:30, we thought we'd hafta pay the extra $2 for the after-
midnight tix price, but thanx to da porn cru's newest initiate Jared aka 
DJ Thrilla, who just so happens to run the Untranslatable Mixed Tape 
Stand (when JJ's too busy), we din't hafta pay anything!...later on i felt 
guilty and tried to pay Anthony, but he wouldn't take it...Hey, glad to see 
some of the new jacks still showin some respects to us old foo's...

THE VENUE - despite the space being used before a few other partys,
it is still a nice li'l venue...the roller skate stand in the back made for
a perfect spot for Jared to set up his mix tape concessions (a humorous
side note wuz the owner of the space let him set-up for 3 techno mixed
tapes), later on one my ole friends from akron (who i later found out
had just recently moved to columbus) set up her phat pants concession
right next to Jared...again they were lending out roller skates, but i 
only saw one girl skatin around dat night...she looked purdy fly rollin
by each time she made a lap by us tho!...i actually liked the set-up for
the sound system a li'l better than from previous partys...instead of a
central location, they used the far left rear wall to set up the speakers
& dj stand...this allowed much more space to dance...including a central
wooden floor area for the breakers dat were throwin down all night...and
if watchin da breakers weren't enuff, they also had some trippy visuals
on the far back walls for added eye candy...other benefits of the space
included booths to chill at, video games to challenge da minds, a food
stand if u got hungry, a drinking fountain, and public bathrooms instead
of scarey port-a-potties...

THE MUSIC - we were lucky altho we had arrived late, they had just
finished setting up about half an hour ago when we got there...unfortunately
i couldn't find a line-up post anywhere, so i wuz unsure of the line-up
all night aside from the headliners that were announced: 

DJ ICEE - welp Icee is better known for his producing skillz rather than
his dj'ing skillz...but this also guaranteed u'd hear tracks that he had just
cut before anybody else has...he had a nice li'l slo breaks set dat gotta
alotta
kids dancin...lez just say his set wuz in tune w/ the peak of many of the 
party peep's state of mind...but it wuz a tad too slo for me...stevie still 
favorin da harder stuff...and i wuz a bit dissapointed he din't play some
RITM, which i feel is the classic Florida sound...but i guess the RITM sound
is a li'l different than the Icee sound...

TREVOR LAMONT - i heard a housey set somewhere in the middle of the
night, i assume it wuz trevor, becuz beside him, i think only Jonathan
aka DJ Sense spun house at the party (wuzn't sure because often thru 
out the night i wuz dancin alone way in the back)...Trevor is the only
DJ I know that consistly delivers a nice set...alwaze dancer friendly
with enough skillz to blend the tracks enough to please the mind and
the feet...i also noticed he has also gone a bit harder, which pleased
me becuz i never wuz a big fan of the screamin diva house tracks (but
i guess those are the ole classics)...

FEELGOOD - i dunno what it is, but i guess i've been spoiled by his set @
IO2 in St. Louis...that by far was prolly one of the best sets i've ever heard
and no matter where i've seen Charles in Cleveland or Dayton from before,
nothing has been able to compare to that set again!...it just doesn't seem
Charles was into it as he was back then...he didn't play with us...he didn't
build us up like he used to do...kids were still really gettin into it, but
def
like the way they were even a year ago...i can't put a finger on it...

MISCELLANEOUS - i had a li'l enhanced introspection myself dat night, i
dunno like Feelgood's set, i noticed that i wasn't getting into it as much as
i used to...it was even difficult for me just to start dancing for some 
reason...and for awhile i sat by myself thinking about the scene itself
and how it has changed and how it changed people...it seemed as if the
longer u've been in the scene, the more complicated things become, i 
think i liked it a li'l better when things were simpler and i didn't know
as much as i do now and i could just dance the night away without any
worries...but to be honest, the highlight of the night for me was my friend
amy coming up to me every once in awhile just to check if i wuz ok...

...i would like to say more about all the thoughts that raced through my
head that night, but alas i have wasted enuff bandwidth already...i guess
u'll just have to seek me out on your own if u really wanna know more,
but i guess that's the only way to ever find out what a person is really
like anywaze...ahhh the good ole daze when u could actually get to know
some one better at a party...how did things get so complicated?...

So what exactly was the big debate about subculture?  What about the
discussion on drugs in the scene, the argument over fashion, the rave
reviews?  Do you read your mail or just delete it when it has a little
"Re:" in front of the subject?  I think our discussions are just fine.  We
talk about things that can be really stressful in most of our lives.  So
what if we wander off subject everyonce in a while.  We could be on a bird
list and talking about what cockatiels eat over and over and over again!
Their diets never change!

You know what else?  I'm sick and tired of talking about whether or not we
should be talking about this or that!  Somebody change the fucking subject
before I puke my beef w/broccoli filled guts out!

so i guess you would agree with those theories of innate bisexuality?

personally i can say that i agree, altho i also think that human sexuality
is a lot more complicated than that ...

ideally, everything you say would be true, but i don't think we live in an
ideal world.  i'll admit to having kissed boys (i won't admit to anything
else :P not here anyways) but truthfully i think most guys think of that
as a gay thing to do.  of course nobody admits to considering gays ... uh,
"bad" ... but most people will admit to never considering a kiss with a
member of their own sex.

especially guys.  i get a lot more homophobia from guys than girls,
possibly because they feel threatened ...

if you have ever said, "i'm fine with homosexuality, as long as nobody
tries anything on me," then you're homophobic.

love
david

ps let me repeat that i'm heterosexual ... my sexual preference is most
definitely for the opposites ... i love you ladies

>WHEN!!!!!!!!!! I never heard decent descusion except from the junglists 
on the

well, i think this may be because jungle is a bit more of a pissing 
comtest than other forms of rave music.....it has the most 
promo/whitelabel/dubplate competition, if you want to dj (or even listen 
to it alot) jungle, you HAVE to keep up on the new stuff....im not 
positive, but i dont think that the same happens so much in the other 
forms.....

i'm interested in making music ... not by mixing records, but by ...

 - creating electronic bleeps and twitches
 - tweaking their pitches and other qualities
 - playing them over and over again
 - extracting interesting samples of just one track (like a flute solo or
cowbell
 - cutting and pasting them together

does anyone know somebody who does this, either for live performance or
for recording?  are there institutions who teach or rent equipment
necessary for learning this stuff?  i know it has to be possible.

sincerely interested
david

This happens to ALL the other forms of dance music.  House, breaks, and
ambient comes to mind especially.  Around these parts I don't see allot
of house white labels, but there are plenty out there.  I used to see it
allot a few years ago with more experimental techno, breaks, & ambient.

alrighty, heres my opinion.....okay, im not hetero sexual, im not 
homosexual, im not bisexual.....im just plain sexual..... hehe.... 
anyway, i am attracted to lots of different things, it just so happens 
that girls posses the attributes i look for more than guys....that said, 
ive messed around with guys, kissed guys, and some other stuff.....ive 
only ever been interested in a guy for a relationship once though, and 
at the time i was involved with a girl...well, what im tryin to say, is 
that i am attracted to the person, not their sexual organs, although i 
still find women attractive physically, much more so than guys, but when 
im lookin for a relationship, i am more fufilled by girls....but when it 
comes to sexual satisfaction....whatever goes.......

well, it sounds like you want a tracker, someone on this list can tell 
you how to download one......theyre usefull for such things...i know 
absolut uses impulse tracker.....trackers are fairly easy to learn and 
use (i think) and you can get fodder for them from the web ,yer cd's, 
and mike recording.....pretty useful, just not professional..

if yer more serious about it, theres alot of software and hardware you 
can get......really expensive though.....the jungle producers blu mar 
ten use a power mac and cubase vst(software) along with a 
sampler(hardware), a midi keyboard, and soem other stuff....not too much 
eqipment, and its not too much money (especiall if you pirate the 
software) and their stuff is released on ltj bukem's good looking 
label..........you can rent dat recorders to use for recording yer stuff 
to have it pressed, other wise, the songs are stored in yer computer, so 
you also need lots of harddrive or a zipdrive or somethin if yer usin 
this approach.........

this is atleast useful for jungle if not other styles...

i was just sayin that the # of promos, dodgy white labels and the like 
that i see in stores for jungle far surpasses the # for other 
styles....thats all, its just a contest to see who can have the most 
newest records the soonest....like i said, it could be that way with 
other styles, but if it is, it isnt quite as obvious to me

p.s.hehe, im talkin out my ass again...

ALL RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!  my kind of talk:)  Now I know that not everyone on this
list is a big "gear head"  So I'm not going to get into specific brand names
and such..well....maybe a few:)  

If you have access to a computer.......which I believe that ya do:)   You can
do alot without a keyboard!!!!!!!!   I've been making tracks for awhile and I
only started using a computer for my music in the past 2 years.   I'll try to
answer your questions simply and quickly and if you want anything more
specific....please email me privately.

  - creating electronic bleeps and twitches -  Easy......there is a program
thats called "Rubber Duck H3O"  It's whats called "a virtual synth"  It uses
the sound card in your computer to make sounds.  You can get a certain
tone.....tweak the pitches and at the same time make some good bass sounds.
I just got demo copy of it this week and it's NICE!!  OH....if you get a demo
copy...and you want to register it...it's about $20.00      BUT....someone
mentioned something about pirating software...well...you should be able to
find a crack for it.

  - tweaking their pitches and other qualities - Hmmmm there are alot of
programs that can do this and depending on what type of music you want to
make...you might want to look into a Roland MC-303 Grove Box.   I was sitting
in one a night over a Radio Carson and a guy was doing a whole set using
nothing but this tiny box!!!!!!   He had a beat, a rhythm, and some other
things thrown in.....I was impressed!  It runs about $730 new.....some place
have payment plans where you pay $120 a month for 6 month:)  

  - playing them over and over again - Cakewalk.....any version will do this.
When you get into music programs many will say (myself inluded) that Cakewalk
6.0 or any later versions are the best!   It's not the easiest thing to
use....but it does alot.  It sequences.  It quantizes.  It even has some built
in/ plug in effects.  Expensive...about $300 for Cakewalk Pro Audio 6.0  For
Cakewalk Home Studio 6.0 (a regular version)  I want to say it's about $99.

  - extracting interesting samples of just one track (like a flute solo or
 cowbell - This is where a sampler comes in.....There was a mention of
Cubase...I've never used it but I've heard about it.   It might be a sampler
of some kind?  Cool Edit can sample but you can't really "extract" particular
parts from a song:-(  

  - cutting and pasting them together - Look into a program called "Cool Edit
Pro" again you can download the demo...and if you like it, find a crack or pay
for it:)  You can very easily cut and paste drum beats, bass lines, or
practically any measure you want:)  It's user friendly so.....like I
said....it's easy to use!  

Hope that this helps!!
Jason

Hi all,
     I just wrote about how I liked Cakewalk.......I've done some research on
Cubase VST....and I may have a new king:)  Does anyone use Cubase????  And if
so how well does it work for you?  And have you ever used it in comparison
with cakewalk???     From what I've been reading about it.....it's nice!!!!!!!

THANKS!
Jason

if you want to make sounds, that gets weird...you can just sample and 
pirate sounds from the net if you use a tracker....a tracker changes the 
pitch and other stuff...

cubase is the most popular program of this sort, in jungle at 
least...alot prefer it over cakewalk, but im not too familiar with 
cakewalk, and i only have the demo of cubase,........so ....

technically, you can create a useable sample with yer computers sound

steinburgh "recycle" apparently works for creatin jungle breaks....i 
dont know ANYTHING about that, but thats what ive heard....and that what 
im gonna get very soon when i start makin my own stuff...
theres a neat jungle producers mailing list.....maybe 2 or 3 mails a 
day....go to the drum and bass arena and go to the mailing list 
section...its all gear and recording talk......pretty kool

Hmm, this IS an interesting thread.  I think jungle has the reputation of
requiring the most current records and dubplates because of the situation
over in london.  It has gotten to be ridiculous!  To be a jungle dj you
have to know alot of big name producers and dubplate houses.  The only djs
that are given props are those that sport the latest and newly pressed
dubplates.  I believe the situation in us to be a little more friendly
with dubplates being the rare treat rather than the badge of a dj's
reputation.  

On this subject, does anyone know if there are any decent dubplate houses
in the pittsburgh area?  Not that I'm quite ready to lay down $50 for a
piece of personal acetate but it might be nice to know in the future.

pEace,
jP

well, (history lesson).....dubplates are a reggae dj thing...they had 
them pressed for competitions....using other peoples music and a 
different mc.....if anyones interested, i can post a big long 
explanation about their history....

if you have no idea what a dubplate is, its a 10 ince piece of steel 
with wax molded around it instead of vinyl.....its used to make one copy 
of a song, generally long before it is planned to be released...oh 
well.....peace,

I like to make ambient, atmospheric music.  I do alot with bioacoustics and
psychoacoustics:)  SO...if you ever hear one of my tracks and you think that
there are subliminal messages in it....then there just might be:):):)
....been doing that for years:)  But I like to make jungle and happy hardcore
too!!!!  As for happy hardcore.......go get a program called "Hammer Head"  It
a virtual drum machine.  After you use it once or twice you'll hear tons of
sounds that you can use/recoginze!!!!!!!  I was impressed with it
actually!!!!!  Want to hear a better part.....IT'S FREE!!!!!!!!!!  And
extrememly easy to use:)    Have fun!   There's a free program called
"Stomper" that I'm downloading right now.....a freebie too:)   It makes 909
sounds, check it out at 

http://www.lysator.liu.se/~zap/stomper.html

Hammer Head is free too (at the moment that is:)

Forreall! I hate this - so many fewer tunes are getting released because
either the producer wants to keep them as exclusive dubs (or gives them to
only 'top' djs), OR they're saving all their material for an album type
format.  In my opinion, this is really slowing down the music's
progression, and in general making me a sadder dj.   I'm just waiting for
the US scene to blow-up, so we can at least get a boost to the singles
coming out each week, and a lil' more variety in the mix - while there's
still lots of good stuff coming out...my impression is that the uk scene
as a whole is gettin' a bit stagnant. :(

I don't think so, coz Farmer Tea & 187 used to ship their stuff away to
get their dubs pressed....i think we're just a lil' too small a market.

I think you're all being a little unfair in concern of dubplates.  Do you
realize the amount of work that has to be done to release a track?  Not
only do you have to first get your foot in the door with a record label or
established producer, but you also have to get into the finer details--
passing samples, fine tuning a track (adjusting the levels, remixing it to
your tastes, etc etc etc), generate enough capital to release the album,
etc.

It's not fair to pass judgment on djs that happen to have a few plates.
More than likely, they've worked very hard to get access to them, and more
power to them for that!  Moreover, to introduce a plate in a set is a
beautiful thing, because it DOES let everyone hear it before it is
released-- i mean, for example college stations get promos of singles for
pop or "alternative" or world beat or WHATEVER hits long before they're
released, because they want to see if people like what they hear.  Maybe
the track can be tweeked a bit before a final release?  Maybe there are
samples that need to be passed, and for reasons like these a white label
dubplate is a *safe bet*.  

Yet at the same time those plates ARE getting played to the public, and
talk generates around them.. new sounds are introduced, new methods of
attack.  People ask "where's that coming from" and chat builds.
do you want to hear new sounds? there they are.  knowledge is key.

Trust me, we are not in Europe, and the dubplates that you hear in America
are not necessarily the same plates played in the US.  Tracks released on
your favorite label that came out this week probably have been floating
around on plate for up to a YEAR in London.  That's because so much shit
gets produced, and there's only so much time and money to release them.

Finally, a "dubplate" doesn't make a good set.  a good mix of quality
tunes makes a set.  and that may or may not include good dubplates,
domestic pressings, no names, flavors of the month and tried and true
classics.

Hmm...

Over in the UK, techno, and especially jungle is basically
equivalent to our Top-40 music over here.  Kids can hear it in
supermarkets, on elevators, on news shows on BBC...

What I'm saying is that since the music that we have to sometimes go
great lengths to listen to and experience here is so common over
there, I tend to think that dubplates and such hold so much more
importance because that's what's drawing the people to the DJ's...
hearing the absolute newest tracks.  Yes, there's mixing skill/art,
but with _so_ many people DJing over there in _so_ many venues, the
politics of DJing and who has access to the newest/hottest/best
has a much larger influence.

This is purely conjecture, however.  What do you think?

That definately wasn't me and I'll tell you why.

I was called earlier that week by the promoters and was told that they have
to cancel me because the great D.J. Icee refused to play in Cleveland and
they had to give him more money to play there.  Consequently they couldn't
afford to bring me out anymore.

Basically I wasn't there because Icee hates Cleveland.

PS - I have been spinning harder lately.  I got tired of playing at 7am and
later. :)

And thanks for for compliment about cinsistancy <sp>

hello all,
  since the subject of making music has cum up on the list,
i figured that now is as good a time as any to mention that
i'm going to be putting together a compilation for my label
this summer.
  i'm now accepting tapes from everyone interested.  the music
does NOT have to be electronic.  in fact, i'd prefer to get a 
wide range of genres.
  my label is incredibly tiny...and just starting out.  and it is a
non-profit label -- meaning you won't get paid a dime for your
music.  all you'll get is exposure.  and of course, i don't make
anything off of it either.
  at any rate, email me back if you have any questions.
i'll be away all next week from spring break, so if i don't write
back immediately, that's why.

thanks,
ryu

any record pressing plant can do 'dubplates'.  these days dubplates look 
just like normal 12"s only they're made of acetate instead of vinyl.  
most pressing plants call them 'acetates' and i'd be willing to bet 
there's someplace in pitt that does it.  if not, you can always deal 
with a pressing plant in another city by mail. 
(i got my plates and the full pressing done at nashville record 
productions, but i wouldn't recommend them... the plate was fine, but 
about 500 of the 1000 records i had pressed were prohibitively warped. 
=/  

good luck

speaking of supermarkets...

if you live in cleveland, i have discovered that dave's ohio city market 
is the coolest grocery store for headz.  i was in there the other nite 
and was hearing some wicked growling 303 over the soundsystem (didn't 
recognize the track) which went right into daft punk's 'around the 
world.'  

sure beats shopping to carly simon.

peace

in the UK, you have a certain set of DJs, a "top tier" sort of, that
have the plates, and for the most part, all of them play it.  meaning
all the big djs play the same plates, so all their sets sound the same
(granted some djs have exclusives, and personal style notwithstanding) 
but you can go the metalheadz on sunday and hear the same choons (90%)
that you'd hear on a saturday night on kool fm or something.  my point
is that the only unique thing about having a place is having a friend of
a friend or whatnot that can get a copy of the dat, cuz it seems that
every dj and their mom has the plates and tests.

Cubase sucks!!!
Dude, cakewalk makes so much more sense.
And as for digital audio, cakewalk editing is way better.
Take cubase for instanse, you have to wait till the 4th or 5th measure to
start recording audio, so the program can sync up the audio with the time
clock.... fuck that, cakewalk syncs up at measure 1. Also if you use cubase
enough you will find alot of stupid bugs....
Trust me cakewalk is the underdog of the century, but it really kicks
sequencing/digital audio ass!
Have fun,

whoa!  big misunderstanding.  First of all I am not down on dubplates or
dj's that have them.  I was just passing along word of what I thought the
jungle situation in london had become (not good IMHO).  As a dj I am
ashamed to say that I have NO dubplates but if I did I sure as hell would
spin them until they were little slivers of acetate (if they were good
and/or my own work).  I'm trying to start producing so I have mad respect
for dj/producers that press and spin their latest creations (this is where
I would like to see the scene go).  I love to hear new trax as much as the
next raver and dubplates are the usual medium that brand new and
experimental music makes it's way from the producer to the raver.

enuf said.  Whoever said that I just wanted a record with my name
timestretched...your damn right! :)  JJJJOOOOOEEEELLLL PRRRYYYYDDDEE aka 
DJ JAAAAMMMMBBBBOOORRREEE IS IN THE HOUSE!!!!  In all seriousness I wish
more dj's would do this as often I have no clue who is up there spinning
and who I can give props to.  I love personal intros as long as they
aren't too much of an ego-trip.

pEace,
jP

Hello everyone,
	
	Although some of us have been crying the evils of Mtv, I have some
news.  187 has a new video that will be on this Friday's (that's March
6th) Amp.  Technically, it's Saturday morning.  I think its at 1am.  Tune
in if you can, it's the most amazing video I've ever seen, and I only saw
the first 4 minutes.  
	Another bit of trivia, the video is not only a song from a sort of
local artist.  The video was produced by local mskw1, also a list member.
I think some "big-ups" and "shout-outs" should go out to our boy mskw1!

Love ya, mskw1!

The JP8000 is pretty cool--lots of sliders 'n' knobs and such, and of
course an arpeggiator.  I haven't heard many true analog synths, so I
don't know how it rates on that scale.  However, I don't think it should
matter--physical modeling synths are opening up new doors of sound
possibilities.  And for opening those doors, I think the Korg Z1 is a
superior synth to the Roland.  More waveforms, including ones liked
plucked string, bowed string, and woodwind, in addition to sine, square,
etc.  The arpegiator has more to it as well.  With all the parameters it
has, you can get a sound that develops and keeps changing over
_minutes_.  Truly a ground breaking machine.  Check it out if you can

Subject: i need help with my school project!!!!!!!

i sent this to other lists if you ould take the time and read blow i 
would appreciate it......any other suggestions that u have for mah 
project i would also appreciate it.......


OK Everyone, I am doing a project on RAVES for school.  My teacher said 
that we had to pick something that we are involved in and I told her 
that I wanted to do RAVES.  She said what are you goin to do it on 
drugs??  And that really pissed me off and I said to her that I am going 
to prove to her that the scene is not all about that and that there is 
more to it.  So she said ok then do it.  We have to get primary sources 
so i decided to make up a list of questions and have people answer them.  
Below is the list of questions, if you could all please take the time to 
answer them I would really appreciate it. It would also be greatly 
appreciated that you send the repplies to ME AND ME ONLY NOT THE WHOLE 
LIST!!!!!!!!  This is not only to avoid everyone getting tons of 
mail(asuming I get a lot of responses...which i hope i do=).....but 
after the project is done I want to send the results to everyone, so I 
kinda want it to be a suprise.  You time is greatly appreciated.  And I 
hope I get a good grade.  
     Also if there are any DJ's and promoters on the list I would like 
you to say a little something about why you chose to be a DJ and if you 
are a promoter what you promate for and why you do this and just a few 
things that you think would help me with my project.  Again I would 
really appreciate this.  
      I will keep everyone updated on how it is coming along.


1)  What is your name? (Optional)
2)  How old are you?
3)  Where are you from?
4)  How old were you when you first started going to "RAVES"?
5)  How often do you go?
6)  Do you travel "far" to go to "RAVES"? (another state, country, etc.)
7)  How did you find out about "RAVES"?
8)  What kind of "RAVE MUSIC" do you listen to?  (hardcore techno, 
jungle, trance, etc.)
9) Do you like any other music beside "RAVE MUSIC"?  If so what do you 
listen to?
10)  Are all of your friends or most of your friends into the "RAVE 
SCENE"?
11)  Honestly why do you go to "RAVES"?
12)  What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of 
"RAVES"?
13)  If you have been going to "RAVES" for a long time now, how do you 
feel that the scene has changed?
14)  What do you feel that we can do together or as individuals to help 
bring the scene back together?
15)  Do you feel the prices for "RAVES" are overpriced?  If so, do you 
still go and why?
16)  Who is your favorite DJ?  Why?
17)  What promotion company or companies do you feel are the most "real" 
to the scene?  Why?  (This could include more than one.)


Thank you for your time.  I really appreciate it.
PEACE OUT 
~COLLEEN~

Hmm... What's the difference from a chick getting mad cause some guy's
hitting on her and a dude getting mad cause some dude's hitting on him? Is
the dude any worse than the chick? No, I dont think so, I think they both
deserve thier space. It's not too much to wait for the vibes to indicate
it's the correct time to make your move, and if you make your move before
that time it can be annoying.

    My personal choice has always been Cakewalk!  It's well laid out and
full of features.  I'll admit it dosn't have the cool graphics that
Cubase does, but who cares.
    In the end it's all about preference and styles.  One is not better
than the other.  I know people are going to flame me for this one, but
fuck it...your not going to hear the program in your music.  They do
have some exclusive features, but for the most part they can do the same
stuff!

wurd,
-John

<< Hello everyone,
 	
 	Although some of us have been crying the evils of Mtv, I have some
 news.  187 has a new video that will be on this Friday's (that's March
 6th) Amp.  Technically, it's Saturday morning.  I think its at 1am.  Tune
 in if you can, it's the most amazing video I've ever seen, and I only saw
 the first 4 minutes.  
 	Another bit of trivia, the video is not only a song from a sort of
 local artist.  The video was produced by local mskw1, also a list member.
 I think some "big-ups" and "shout-outs" should go out to our boy mskw1!
 
 Love ya, mskw1!

<<>if you have ever said, "i'm fine with homosexuality, as long as nobody

an ironic side point is that many of the producers of the original 
chicago house tracks were black gay men (i'll refrain from dropping 
names here out of respect for them), and many of the patrons of the 
original house clubs were also gay...pfft...some of the more 'fabulous' 
club kids back in the day were all gay...remember the Project X magazine 
tour back in the day?

basically i think the theory of relativity can be applied to the scene 
here (this was actually one of the many thoughts that ran thru my head 
at Detonation), everyone has their own version of reality...i dated a 
lesbian girl once...and when i first met her she really disliked males...
for some reason probably due to her parents divorce, she thought all men 
were evil...she was even a member or riotgrrl & she spoke openly about how 
she disdained the typical american male...this was her relative reality...
then all of a sudden i became a part of her reality...i was not the 
typical  american male...somehow we clicked...she gave me the benefit of 
the doubt and had a go at a hetero relationship with me...she no longer 
slanders males openly...and has since become a practicing bi-sexual...

i guess my point is: truth is relative...what may be true to you at one 
point may not be the truth to you later on...and everybody has their own 
relative truths...dj's may only be concerned with the newest tracks & 
musical gear, so any subjects outside of that may seem irrelevant and a 
waste of time for them...however most party go'ers are not DJ's, they're 
not concerned with the latest tracks and long discussions of 303's, 909's, 
or the next latest Roland, would just bore them to death...

this also explains the misunderstanding that the folks at 20/20 have 
percieved of our scene...how can a group of individuals more concerned 
with ratings, pleasing their sponsors, pleasing the taste of the typical 
american 9 to 5, football watchin, beer drinking, gotta send the kids to 
school, gotta pay the bills viewers possibly understand what is like to be 
in our scene without ever being a part of it?...how can we understand the
difficulties of putting a show together, gathering all the money for ads, 
making the deadlines, making all the edits, pleasing all our sponsors, 
making sure barbara's make-up is done to perfection without ever being 
a part of it?...

how do i know?...cuz...

"i am the creator, and this is my house, and in my house there is only
 house music...but i am not so selfish, because once you've been to my
 house, it then becomes our house and our house music...and you see, 
 no one man owns house, because house music is a universal makeup
 spoken and understood by all...you see house is a feeling, and no one
 can understand the feeling unless he's deep into our house..."

;)

WHOA!!!!!!!!!!!  I thought I was a bit harsh:):):)    Finephunk.....I asked
everyone on the board if they knew anything about the differences between
Cakewalk and Cubase.  I've never used Cubase before and I just wanted some
input.  Now I don't know how long Sleepy C has been making music....But I've
playing for 8 years and been making computer generater sounds for the past 4

Maybe you can tell me why Emagic Logic is the best?  I'd like to hear why. And
whats so good about it????

Look cock sucker....
I been making electronic music since 1986... so blow me...
Not only that, I have releasesd 28 commercial  12" and CD  releases as
Sleepy C, Steven CInch, Stephen CInch, Seritonin Project and  Dj Elvis.
So I think I may know something about the studio.
Also, I used cubase for 7 years, and when I compared cubase VST to Cakewalk
audio 6.0, Cakewalk won without any compromise!

Your just a small, stand in front of the dj writin down all the records he
plays ,bring your records to every gig hopein to play, no skill, carrin the
few records you have in a cardboard box, spice girl playin, hopein to
someday be able to do a mix tape thats longer than 30 min a side, beat
counter ownin, puttin your name on someone else's mixtape punk ass looser!!

Your through, as soon as I find out who you are I'll put my size 12 up your
ass!! You can't hide forever!

or the tacky screensaver ;)

i use cakewalk myself, but saw a new version of seq-303 and have to look
into that, i wish that the development of tekknobox would've continued, it
looks/works well, but had bugs and there seems to be "no one home" on
their end.
anyone familiar with logic?  i havent given it a look, or cooledit pro?
cubase just seems to awkward to me, i've tried 2.8, 3.0xt, but not 3.5vst,
but it mostly looks the same.

In a message dated 98-03-05 22:34:44 EST, you write:

<< i havent given it a look, or cooledit pro?
 cubase just seems to awkward to me, i've tried 2.8, 3.0xt, but not 3.5vst,
 but it mostly looks the same. >>

I work with Cool Edit Pro....it's nice to do some things...rough to do others.
For example if you have a wav. file, cool edit will bring it up and play
it...you can then manipulate it a few nice ways including time-stretching.
BUT...I've found problems when you go and paste everything together.  Say you
have 4 tracks laid down...well to put them in sync.  it's a bit difficult.  I
use it mostly to spice up some tones I've generated or to fool around with a
good wav. file  OH...it's very easy to use too:)

if u hadn't been smokin so much crack, u prolly could've came up w/ a slightly

of 'pissface' tho (not to be confused w/ Pig Face, an industrial group to kewl

i believe altho she wuz a lesbian, she is still a woman, uhm dat would mean

sorry to dissapoint, but i don't smoke dick, but i hear dats da next step

actually the funny part is, that post was totally true, in fact i think hossam

ok, i'll watch my back & i'll stick a big ole plate down my pants, so if u

ok, so I'm throwing the party and I think there should be a netmeet.
let's make it 1:00 in the foyer (it'll be the small room that you need
to go through to get to the main room & it has carpet.)
I don't know whether or not I will be busy at that time, but at least
everyone else has a set time =)

I sucks fat bulbos dick. (No offense to Dj Pulse cause he's my boy) but Lp
the promoter is a big retarded, lame, shamless,shady, fake booking, scum
bag. I would not support him at all.

He posted thet he has booked, Daft Punk, Sneak, and Green Velvet for his
club nights... Well.....

Daft Punk will not even play in the states for the next 18 months!! There
touring in Europe.
Sneak is playing at Pleasure in a few weeks, and his manager told Rob that
Sneak will not be comming back to cleveland any time soon, (ie. Lp lied!!)
And as for Velvet... don't know but from Lp's track record... donm't look
to feasible.

Hint... Support Pleasure on Wed. at least ya know the tallent will be there,
Support Musik on Thursdays, the music is good, and the promoter has a good
heart towards the scene ;), fridays up to you... Sat and Sund have fun!!

These are my opinions , and just my opinions, so there!

;)

I'd like to think I'm not the only person who got this flyer... but seeing as
it hasn't been listed in the long list of upcoming events we keep getting sent
to us, freshly updated...  Says it's in the Akron/Cleveland area, something
like 25 or so dj's.  $20 at the door...

Anyone who can confirm that this is real, say something -- anything!

That name again folks -- "Rave The Planet," March 14th.

Yeah, I was wondering about that too.  I have a preflyer for it that I 
think is the flyer you're talking about.  I don't know anything more 
than you do though.

This event is in youngstown I believe but I might be wrong.  I am playing
this event so I know it is for real.  But then, with my luck in that area
lately we may have to see. :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Hardware Review - Roland MC-505

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Whee. Guess who was bored, and went to Geeeetar Centre with a fiend, er,
friend. :)

So, now, I bring you...

The Roland MC-505. The new groovebox. I musta stood there for over an HOUR
screwing around with it.

Pros;

MUCH better than the shit MC-303. MUCH *MUCH* better.
Theremin style device! WOO!
Memory card slot. Yay.
Multiple outputs.
MIDI.
*REAL* fucking knobs and shit. Not entirely digital trash.

Cons;
It's STILL not a goddamned 303. When will Roland learn this?
It's not a 606, 808, or 909 either damnit.
It STILL doesn't have the same feel.
It's SLOW when you really get going.
It's big, it's bulky, it's fucking *HEAVY* too.

In Depth;
Okay, here's this $1249 box. It's big. It's bulky. It's heavy. It's
Charcoal. I don't like charcoal. It's got white lettering. I don't like
white lettering. It's got a wacked out LCD display. I LOVE that. It's got
lotsa blinking lights. I *ABSOLUTELY ADORE* that! Equalizers and knobs and
buttons, oh my! What is it? The Roland MC-505. And boy does it suck!

I decided to start out with the demo, as I always do. It sounds good. I'm
interested. So I kill the demo, and poke around the examples and defaults.
Sounds good. So, let's explore, shall we? What the hell is THIS thing?
"Turntable, Cut+Reso, Adlib?" OoO! Theremin style device! *hits on, sets to
"Turntable,"* *waves hand a bit* *music comes to a screeching halt* What
the FUCK? *look at BPM* 44?!? *moves hand* 34?!?!? Well, looks like their
"turntable" thing only goes from 34 to 44 BPM. Bah. Let's try AdLib, might
be neat. *moves hand* Bah. Weird ass crashing and basically everything at
once with no tempo or ANYTHING. That REALLY sucks. Now, for Cut+Reso. I
*LIKE* reso. *moves hand* GROOVY!! *moves hand all over the place*

In short; Turntable sucks. Adlib sucks. Cut+Reso is *GREAT*. I love it.
With some practice, you can do some REALLY neat effects with it.

Okay, now we've found a cool effect that could be put to good use. Let's go
whacko with the example stuff, and this great effect, shall we? AWRIGHT!
Let's go. *groovegroovegroove* *push button* What the fuck? *push button
again* *light changes, then changes back* Oh shit. *try to change BPM*
*watch it crawl as I spin the dial like a madman* Oh great. *stop using
cut+reso, hit stop, change BPM* *BPM flies*

Guess what? It doesn't work too well if you wanna do something live. It
apparently doesn't have the power to handle the theremin or anything else
when you really get going. Isn't that just great?

Other than that, it's really just another MC-303, with knobs and shit for
everything. And blinky lights. Lots more. A little more powerful
feature-wise, but not enough power inside to handle those features.

I give the MC-505 one thumb up, one thumb down. It's got a lot of great
features, and is a bit closer to the originals, but these features are
underpowered, and it will certainly perform poorly as a live performance
box. There's a lot of room for improvement, but as is, if you take the time
to program a whole set, it's actually an ok box.

I think I'll stick to the TB-303/TB-303/TB-303/TR-808/TR-909 setup I have
now, thanks.

peaceorgetdancedon!

Was this meant for this list?  Well, anyway - I just picked up a flyer for
a hardcore show there, so here's some directs:

The Millvale Industrial Center is located right on 28 South.  Look for
signs on the right side of the highway.  If you are getting there through
28 N, take the Millvale exit, make a U-turn so you are back on 28 S.  They
have numbers for more info, but i think its just for this particular show.

Has anyone been to this place yet?  I'v seen lots of shows of all kinds
booked there in the past couple weeks, I'v never been there.  I'm looking
for a venue for a small-medium sized rave (300-500), so I'm thinkin -
maybe this is a good spot?

l8s,
 cutup

  First, I guess I should introduce myself to the list.  I have wanted to
go to a rave ever since I was introduced to the music somewhere around
'92.  For silly reasons I never went to a rave until '96.  It was "That
Thing".  I have only considered myself a 'raver' in the past 3 or so
months.  I defining a 'raver' as someone who looks forward to going to
most of the parties and not just occasional raves.  I have been lurking on
the list for a few weeks now.  So that's my background.  Sorry, no
intimate sexual details.
  
  Now I do have something to discuss here.  Last weekend my roomate and I
went and stayed at my parents house, right outside DC (I go to school in
Pittsburght but DC is my hometown).  We figured that we could go to Buzz
(a rather big clubnight catering to the big pants crowd) and do some
record shopping.  Well my bonehead roomate was spaced out thinking about
something else and he forgot his ID.  We figure well, maybe the bouncers
will take his college ID (you have to be 18 to get into clubs in DC).  Of
course the bouncers won't take it.  They are not interested in any
discussion and don't give a shit about any sad stories about coming all
the way from pittsburgh.  They are rude and condescending and they are not
interested in being helpful or understanding in any way.  Now, since it's
DC law that you need proper ID that says you are 18, I can't really call
them assholes for not letting Jeff in but they could have been nice or
understanding about it.  
  That was friday night.  On saturday there is a smaller clubnight called
Deep.  We figured its worth a shot to see if they will let him in.  They
bouncers at deep are much more chill, some of them look like ravers
themselves.  They have a sense of humor and have no problem taking Jeff's
college ID as long as he does not want to drink.  Now Deep does not have
as big a sound system or supastah DJs like Buzz but there are 3 floors and
the crowd is a bit more relaxed and there is some excellent local talent.
We had a great time at Deep.
  Now, you ask, why am I telling this story?  Well I was sort of making an
observation and not just about assaholic bouncers.  It seems to me that
Buzz is all about money and they could give a shit about PLUR or the
music. Ravers just happen to be their target audience.  I just heard that
Buzz has made it an official policy that you can't bring in your own
glowsticks.  You have to buy them inside (along with official Rave On
gear) if you want them.  So I guess the only reason they bring in big name
DJs is so they can bring huge crowds and charge $25 to get in.  Maybe I'm
wrong but it seems that Buzz is all about money.  I think that this tends
to happen in any large scene.  
  I hope it does not happen in Pittsburgh.  I like the Pittsburgh scene
more than DC.  Its much more low key and intimate.  True, there are not as
many events and Paul Oakenfold does not show up every 2 weeks but there
are some good parties and some really great (and sometimes underrated)
local DJs.  The scene here is much more underground and pure.  You know
that Hypervinyl, House of Styles, Future Sounds and most of the promoters
and DJs, they are not in it for the money.  Sure they don't want to go
broke but if they were really just out for a buck they would be playing
the Barbie song in some bar club night sponsored by the X.
  412 Reprazent!

CORRECTION:
  The thing about not being able to bring glowsticks into Buzz was
bullshit.  Some kid posted it to ne-raves and it was just a nasty rumor
that somebody started.  Guess that weakens my point a bit.

somebody should borrow those props + put them in a party space. (look
i made this thread rave related!) the DJs could spin on top of the merry-
go-round + the clock could be a vending table. i don't know what to do
with the rest of it.

the purple panda was my favorite character because he/she was mysterious.
for a long time i though "lady aberline" was one word + it was her first
name. maybe that was before i could read or something.

i always try to remember to bring my walkman with me when i go grocery
shopping. i find techno to be the most conducive to a productive shopping
trip, the more minimal + tweaked, the better.

why the hell would you even be looking at the mc-505 with that kind of 
setup!!!  just kidding with ya. however, i think there should be a law
against owning more than one tb-303.  you know some of the rest of us 
would like the opportunity to own one...

don't be such a freakin hog...  and no, i don't want to buy yours for

don't flame me for posting a bunch of stuff at once, because this is the
only time i've gone thru my e-mail in almost a week.

anyway on one of these lists somebody said something about movie
projections at parties, but i don't remember which, but it's relevant + i
made a list of movies that would be cool to show. i didn't put any anime
movies on it because just about any anime makes good material although the
more action scenes the better. some of these movies i guess you'd have to
cue them right to get to the good parts.

fantasia
2001: a space oddysey
all the star wars movies
light years
blade runner

but if the theme was evil + hardcore, other movies would be more
appropriate like

terminator 1+2
apocalypse now
naked lunch
caligula
boxing helena
phantoms 

these are just movies i can remember i've seen so i'm sure there's
zillions i haven't.

Truth is - your right.  I was just shocked that they were on live.  Even a
small gesture by 'the X' is pretty shocking to me, although not in any
really shocking sense.  The general publiks music appriciation has to
evolve a bit before some 'real' techno ends up on the X.  Its just a whole
other aesthetic.

people on dis list have to chill.

some questions to ask yourself before posting:
1) "does anyone give a shit about what i have to say?"
2) "have i posted more than 10 times today?"
3) "should keep this dicussion in private and not waste much bandwidth?"

im sure there are more, but that's a good start
(sorry to be wastin more bandwidth about this whole subject but it for
your own good :)

I don't think it will happen.  I think pop just appropriates little bits
and peices.  Check out the latest Madonna or Jamiroquai or Bjork.  Not
that these artists are bad but you don't see any true electronic artists
making it big.  The Prodigy is big but they had to adopt a sort of "techno
rock group" motif before they gained wide acceptance in the US market.  So
sure, you will hear those snare riffs and squelchy acid sounds but it will
be backing up some high profile singer, crooning about romance.  
  I'm glad that it will stay underground for the most part.  I think that
when art becomes big money and big business it loses some of the original
intent.  Artists are pressured by labels to produce material in a certain
way and some artists think more about what makes a catchy popular song
than what makes a quality song.  Some say that the underground becoming
mainstream is a good thing because then the underground has to go and
reinvent itself.  The real artists end up going in a completely different
direction and producing something wierd and interesting.

For those who don't know, this event is going to take place at a new
venue.  And I mean new . . . sounds from planet bass will be the first
event they have ever held.  it is called the Millvale Industrial Theatre
. . . and is prety close to pgh, but isn't acutally in the city.  It is
on route 28, just across the 31st St, 40th St and Highland Park Bridges. 
they seem to be a strictly music event place, and hopefully a consistant
good spot to throw raves.  Does anybody else have any information of the
actual spot?  If anyone has any extra time you might want to drive around
and try to find it and check it out.

OK, this has got to stop for real.  This is the Pittsburgh Cleveland Rave
Mailing list and not the Good Movie Mailing list.  And its not really
this one post, its a whole bunch of shit that's been flowing through the
list for a while now.  For a while trout soup was trying to get people to
stop talking about general rave shit like the ever reaccuring topic of
comercialization because it wasn't about current rave events in the
pgh-cle area.  And I'm sick of weeding through all the bullshit posts.  I
mean no offense to Tom or anyone else included in this "conversations",
but maybe you should get your own mailing list for people who like to go
to raves but don't really want to talk about them.

I used to not understand why trout soup would get so mad, but now I
understand.  Maybe its time for another poll of what the list should be?

I personally don't have problems with discussion as long as its
interesting, but, like Todd said, that's not why most folks subbed to this
list.  

I've never subbed to it, but there does exist a "Social Raves" list
(look on Hyperreal for more info) just for free discussion  as well as
irc, icq, and probably tons of chatrooms.

Is there a FAQ for this list?  Maybe there should be one that states
what's 'tolerated'.

Also - if anyone wants to start a pb-cle social list - I'd support it.
Not that we need any more seperation.

let the list roll; let it take its own form.  haven't you learned?  you
can't suppress free-thought.  we will begin to put digits in our subjs that
represent (no, not reprazent) their relevance to appropriate list
conversation.  on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is...[there is a rave under the
schenely park swimming pool on jul 23] and a 5 would be [do you like lemon
cookies?]

i am not joking.

Not publically served by hyperreal.  Are you sure you're not
thinking of socal-raves?  That's SOuthern CALifornia, not SOCiAL.

I realize that tempers tend to run high when it comes to this subject, so
please try not to despise me too much.  I kind of like jungle
in some mainstream songs.  I know that many of the artists are just
jumping on the band wagon, but isn't that what all mainstream really is,
people jumping on the band wagon and making a form of art, music, etc,
popular?  

I think that jungly bits in new songs really make them much more
interesting.  I like the remix of that David Bowie song that Trent Rezner
did, I think it was called something like "I'm afraid of americans" or
something.  I also like the new Madonna song, Frozen, although it might
have something to do with the video.  There are others.  Have you ever
heard of a band called Moloko?  They had a song on the last Batman movie
sountrack.  They have a song called Butterfly 747 and one called HoHumm
that are extremely jungly.  They aren't as mainstream as the others, but
you can see where it's all going.  Actually, I think the long time
bestselling artists do well BECAUSE they're able to change with the
trends.  I think that different forms of electronica (please don't blast
me for that term, I don't know any other blanket terms, feel free to
suggest) are truly the next BIG THING.  That's not only MY opinion; you
can see it in everyday media (i.e. commercials, news shows, cartoons,
dramas, etc).  Does anyone remember that show about firefighters?  Jungle
between every transition.

I'd love to see a JUNGLE remix of that Madonna song.
Depending on how good it was, I'd probably never stop dancing to it!


That's my thought.  Please add to it but keep in mind any uncalled for
aggression will be dealt with accordingly.

Cleveland on Friday, March 20th (it's free).

You may sign up online -- http://www.dezines.com/web/catchy/

Cleveland Akron Toledo Canton Huron and Youngstown -- CATCHY. 

* The CATCHY Job Fair is taking place Friday, March 20th from 3:00 to 7:00
P.M. at the downtown Cleveland Sheraton.

* The Sheraton is located at 777 St. Clair between E. 6th and E. 9th.

Thanks,

Braden Albert

Hey...I heard the most beautiful song on the way home. :)
Anybody happen to know the name/artist of a hardcore song
with the refrain of some guy screaming 'Bang Your Head'?
Any help is greatly appreciated...:)

Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew anything about stuff going on
in Cincinnati, or any good record stores, etc?  I am going to be
there for five days or so and have never been there so any info
would be appreciated.  Thanks :)

I had to leave early from steel city (my dearest aunt PAT was my ride), so
i didn't pick up any flyers for the next one - can anyone fill me in on
who'll be there?

For about the 8th million time - it seemed like noone was going to show up
- there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place at 11pm - and
then BLOW - about 100 or so people just walked in the door.  All kinds -
a pretty good mix of ravers and plainclothes - and i must say alot of
folks were dancin'....Sad to leave coz I was gettin that happy feelin
bouncin' to some older stuff from Sine, and the beginnin' of snuggles (the
S the N the U the G the G...:)

this should be a nice party, but thomas michael isn't spinning at it..
although it isn't at all the promoters fault.  he booked himself for the party
right around the time he signed on with a new agent, who had in turn,
contracted him to spin somewhere else that night..  being a new agent and all,
he was unable to get out of the contract so he won't be in columbus.  this is
directly from thomas too.. 

lou

PS thomas michael will however be spinning in cleveland for me on july 25th =)

*More info on the webpage: www.andrew.cmu.edu/~ecoslor/planetbass.html

*Directions: take route 28 out of downtown pittsburgh. go toward
millvale/aetna. you will pass the space (it's on the left, it's called
millvale industrial park. big white sign & red buildings), but there's a
median, so you have to go past and turn around. watch out for the
driveway, it's kind of easy to miss. the space is the building with the
kissel sign and crazy cases of sunkist/pop machines & old cars sitting
around. better directions will be on the infoline tomorrow.

If we meet at 1am in front of the smart bar, how'll we know it's us?
Maybe we should write pb-cle-raves on our foreheads with black sharpies ;)

JUST out of curiousity, who's doing smart bar?

National / International weird sex laws

                               14 US Sex Laws:

In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: There is a law agains having sex with a truck
driver in a toll booth. 

In Nevada: There is a law against having sex without a condom. 

In Willowdale, Oregon: There is a law against a husband talking dirty in his
wife's ear during sex. 

In Clinton, Oklahoma: There is a law against masturbating while watching two
people have sex in a
car. 

In the state of Washington: There is a law against having sex with a virgin
under any circumstances
(including the wedding night). 

In Tremonton, Utah: There is a law against having sex in an ambulance. 

In Newcastle, Wyoming: There is a law against having sex in a butcher shop's
meat freezer. 

In Alexandria, Minnesota: There is a law against a man having sex with his
wife with the stink of
onions, sardines, or garlic on his breath. 

In every state in the union: There is a law against having sex with a corpse.
(presumably it is the
perceived *necessity* for this law that earned it a place on the list.) 

In Ames, Iowa: There is a law against drinking more than three slugs of beer
while lying in bed with a
woman. 

In Fairbanks, Alaska: There is a law against two moose having sex on the city
sidewalks. 

In Kingsville, Texas: There is a law against two pigs having sex on Kingsville
airport property. 

In Ventura County, California: There is a law against cats and dogs having sex
without a permit. 

In Washington, D.C.: There is a law against having sex in any position other
than face-to-face. 

                          Some International Sex Laws:

When the husband of a Tasmanian woman dies, the law requires that she wear her
dead husband's
penis around her neck. The women of Gippsland,in Australia, do the same thing.
(I wonder how
these laws would apply to Lorena) 

According to Iranian law, a man is required to perform his abutions if he
ejaculates while having sex
relations with an animal. 

On a similar note, Citizens of most Middle Eastern countries are forbidden to
eat lamb under certain
circumstances covered by Islamic law. The law reads, "After having sexual
relations with a lamb, it is
a mortal sin to eat its flesh." (What I want to know is "Why would this have
to be made?") 

The law in Bhutan doesn't allow a younger brother to lose his virginity before
an older brother loses
his. Nor may a younger brother marry before an older brother marries. 

In Uruguay, a husband who who catches his spouse in bed with another man is
given an option
under the current law. He has the right to kill both his wayward wife and her
lover-or he can choose
to slice off his wife's nose and castrate her lover! (AHHH, the joy of giving
the public a choice!
Capitalists would be proud)

Well, no there are no flyers, and I don't know if Spawntaneous even has a
line up yet, but I do know one thing...
He is using my Psychoactive name on the small pre-flyers and on the tickets
he was trying to sell.

Please note........
PSYCHOACTIVE will have no part in this years 420!!
So if it really sucks, I don't want to get any complaints sent to me!
Peace,

Just wanted to let everyone who is planning on going to this to know that
the info line says ***25*** (not 20) dollars  at the door, and it is being
held at the Cleveland Agora. There is parking at 5001 Prospect Ave for $5
and you can also park on the street surrounding. They will have all three
rooms open. The info line says to show up early (doors open at 8), and
from previous experience at big parties in this space, you *really* want
to show up early unless you want to wait for 2 hours in line in the
freezing cold (it's really cold and bitterly windy in Cleveland right
now). 

Will not see you there,

Kate

What's up eerybody.  I guess this is the first post regarding last
night's event, Sounds from Planet Bass, which took place at the Millvale
Industrial Theater.  Maybe I was one of the few, but I had a fucking
great time.  

Music/djs:
I arrived around 12, to see someone playing some pretty hard shit, that
looked kind of aisan (maybe sushi k?) then the instigator came on.  As
always he rocked the house, but this time there was definitely a
different tone to his set.  He played a couple of track with electro
breaks and cut-up samples of people talking fast/rapping.  That is soo
unlike the instigator.  He was really getting into it, and did a great
job with the mixing as well.  Crowd reaction to this was good.

Then Starchild came on.  This was a phenomenal performance If I've ever
seen one.  His creation of an extended intro by the blending of half
speed jungle intros and then cuting back before they broke, blew me away,
untill after some rap/r&b shit, it broke into jungle brother, the
aphrodite remix.  After this he continued to kick it hardcore with a wide
selection of other Aphrodite stuff, taking it back his old school stuff. 
As his set went on it never faltered.  Dropping tunes left and right and
always with excellent timing.  His selection ranged all over the place,
but he always kept it hard and never let up.  A FEW of the tracks he
played were,  lighter, the bomber, ding dong bass, its jazzy, brown paper
bag full vocal mix, ya rockin (not the normal mix, or the ass remix, but
a good one), wardance, broader than broadway (I don't if this is the
name, but it has that sample), and many many more.  The highpoint of his
set forme though, was Wishing on a Star.  I called for the rewind, and
unlike other DJs, he actually many other DJS, he gave it to me.  
Another aspect of his set that made thing much better, was the energy he
put into it.  He was behind the decks, throwing his hands in the air, and
having a great time.
Afterwards, I told him how much I enjoyed his set, and we discussed a
little about the resurgence of the old school and that how soon tech step
will be gone almost completely.  After this he gave me a copy of his new
promo tape "Pimpin' aint easy".  I've only listened to about the first 20
minutes of it, but it sounded just as good as his set.  

Whoever was on after starchild was pretty good, but after 2+ hours of
jungle mayhem, my energy was drained, and I wasn't moved enough to start
dancing again.  His set was pretty hard, with some acid throughout.  It
may have been high octane.

Space:
This is definitely not your normal venue.  
Pros:
It is cheap
It has two rooms.  
The main room has a large enough dance floor to get a vibe going on. and
adaquate places for people to hangout while taking rests etc.
Due to its rudimentary nature, there is a lot to work with.
Nice carpeted clean room in addition to other two rooms.  This isn't very
big, but a great change from teh other rooms.
Cons:
Its very dirty.  When I returned home I found that I had black soot
underneith my nose, all over my hands . . . basicaly the only place there
wasn't soot/dirt was under my socks.
The small carpeted room, is very condusive to acuumulation of smoke.  It
was hard to stay in there for longer than a few mintues, because your
eyes started to itch from all the smoke.

Lights:
There were large black flourescent lights throughout the entire space,
and these made for a generaly light atmosphere.  There were a few other
moving lights, but nothing special, and I don't think there was a fog
machine, so that made the lights present, a little less distinguishable. 
There was a video team there who were great.  They were mixing incredible
3-D animation with all sorts of trippy patterns and fractals and the
like.  I've never seen stuff like this before, but hope that it becomes
the norm at pgh events.  

Sound system: 
The sound system was pretty ass.  The bass was sufficient, but I don't
think there were any tweeters, or high frequency speakers there.  This
caused the majority of the vocals to be distorted and overloaded
sounding.  I didn't care about this all that much, because it did the
job, but it definitely could have been better.  The second room speakers
were pretty decent for a second room.

Crowd:
During the Instigator's set, people were all over the dance floor, and
there was a good atmosphere.  When Starchild came on, it got a little
mroe crowded for about the first half an hour.  After this, the people
that weren't all that interested or could hang, left and it got emptier. 
As his set went on this continued.  Untill at one point, it was me, my
friend ben and like one other person dancing.  This was pretty nice,
because it gave you a lot of space to work with, and you didn't have to
worry about bumping into anybody or anything.  It was frusterating though
seeing such good music going to waste.  Towards the end of his set, a few
more people came up to the dance floor, but it wasn't packed or anything.
 Afterwards, the house crew came out and things started to pick up some
more.

There was a succesfuly netmeet, with 15 people in attendence.  thanks for
the free water jason, and that bottom of the conatiner froot tooty was
extremely powerful!  

shout outs go to all those in attendance, and see you later,

ABSOLUT

PS-Please excuse the extremely long message.

Remember how people were talking about how E is so prevelant now and 'cid
is hard to come by?  Well it was the exact opposite at sounds from planet
bass last night.  Everbody had hits (geltabs, paper, you name it) and
nobody had E.  It came later after 1:00, but it was wierd.  that's the
first time I can ever remember that happening.  People were fiending. 
whoever did bring it made a lot of $$ :)

Anyone else catch "We Are Not Alone" on amp last night (really late, around
quarter of 3)?  It had lots of shuttle footage and alleged UFO videos.
10/10 for sticking to the subject, but I think some of the graphics could
have been a little slicker.  Just my opinion, and I'm no expert.

Yeah, I have to agree, I had a fucking good time.

When I first got there I thought it was a little too bright in the main
room, but after a while I kinda got used to it... there was a pretty good
turnout, the peak amount of people was about perfect for the space I
think... There was ALOT of dancing going on, prolly the largest percentage
of people were dancing that I can remember (at like 3 or 4am or so)... The
netmeet was pretty cool :) Everyone was really nice and friendly... Got to
meet Trout :) He had the coolest teddybear on his back... Jennifer Foulmood
was exactly as I had expected her to be, In fact I spotted her long before
the net-meet, and said to myself: "That's Jennifer"...(she's very pretty :))
Jason (selling the drinks) is about the coolest person you could meet :)
There was someone else I was hanging with for a few hours I cant remember
his name tho, we finally scored some E at like 3am, but by then I prolly
didnt even need to take it, cause I was having a great time. I also met
Erika (who was very cute, and nice :)) All in all I had a great time till
the place really thinned out, then (at least it seemed to me) it started to
get pretty cold again, and I finally left like 5am or 6 or so. (when I was
walking in someone outside said it was warmer outside than it was inside,
and I pretty much agree, it was cold as piss in there except when everyone
was dancing and all that bodyheat was going on). The guy maintaining the
place was pretty much an asshole to me, had a little run-in with him in the
bathroom but it didnt really phase me having a good time :) Yeah I'd say
that overall this was one of the best lineup of DJs in the main room that I
can remember. I didnt like the lighting at all really. but the Video stuff
was way cool, I stared at it for like the first 2 hours heh :) It could have
been cooler if it was a little darker in there to get a good look at the
projection tho... I danced more than I have at any other party, I was
dancing for about 3 of the 6 hours I was there I'd say, (my dancing leaves
alot to be desired if you saw some tall dude that looked spastic that was me
:))

     I would like to express my thanks to all who made The pb-cle Net Meet a
success.  From what was told to me, most net meets only consist of 1-2 people.
Well...we had a totally of 15 people!!!  A nice turn out I would say:-)   Dan
was the first to arrive....then Miss Foulmood:-)  then........a swarm of you
just appeared:) 
We all talked for about 15-20 minutes.  The conversations ranged from 1.8.7
videos to people talking about the party itself.  

I'm glad that ......

Dan - I'm glad you found what you were looking for!

And to my new pal (whose name I've sadly forgotten!!!!!!  and I am very sorry)
Who not only gave me a nice piece of fruit, but who can also change ones
perspectives:-)

It was a great party and a fabulous space!   I hope to see all of you soon.

P.S.  Kay got wind that we were talking about her on this list and

Hey all - just though i'd chime in here - I had an awesome time here
myself.  Very positive vibe, good sets all around, and I talked to lots of
friendly folks. :)  Way to go Erica!  Any future plans?

As for the net meet much for cafe 2000 makin' it happen...i think we made
up like 10% of the folks at that party!  I think that was the first time a
'net meet' really worked that i actually made it to. :)  Shouts out to all
the folks who said hi! :)

Not much more to say - all in all a fun time.

<ObBitch>
Normally I can find SOMETHING to bitch about regarding a rave, but the only
thing I can bitch about sounds from planet bass was how much my body ached
from dancing and the two days worth of sneezing black, and both of those
are to be expected.  What can I say, the party rocked!
</ObBitch>

Yusei and his video crew were my fav, *THATS* what I meant about video at
parties and I think we need more of.  I kind of find it ironic that with
all the bigger promoters doing the previos parties the best visual setup
came from one of the smallest budget partie ive seen. Would have been nice
to have some lasers but with the small space they probably wouldn't have
fit in as well.  (Or fit the budget)

I also thought the redgreen light bounced on the ceiling was cool as shit.
Did anyone else notice that they tuned it directly to the music by bouncing
it off of a sheet of some sort of metal hung over one of the speakers? The
light refracted intune with the bass, thats cool ingenuity.  

And from talking to several people I learned that I have no clue what im
talking about when it comes to techno/rave/digital music and its names :).
I didnt realize there were so many types of jungle out there, guess it
makes sense since there are so many styles of every other type of music, I
had misassumed that jungle was the lowest unit name for a style of music
and happened to attach it to one specific instance that I didnt like, not
the name for an entire genre, so now I know that I like some jungle and
dont like other jungle. (I like "dark step" but cant dance to it thats the
only name a i learned and remembered this time, im gunna start writing them
down :)

But by and large the music the entire night just rocked, I am extremely
glad there was a lot of variety, especially since there were a lot of
people for whom this was their first rave.  I would think anyone who showed
up got a good first impression.

I also though it was funny that there was zero security and almost no cop
presence. As far as I could tell they only showed up twice, the first time
I dont know what they did but the second time they 'hung out'.  One of em
was even tapping his feet to the rythem and checking out yosei and his
monitors.

I was content a lot of the night to just sit and listen and watch.
Apologies for being incohorent most of the time (hey Jennifer :) but I was
heavily chemically endowed and the vibe was so strong I couldnt think, just
enjoy :) So for those of you I talked to I only remember a few names/faces,
specifically jenifer, trout and dan. For those of you I met but I dont
remember, introduce yourself next time again :) i was the guy with the
ripped jeans and CDs attached to shorts.  (Some guy called me a digital
cowboy ready to shoot a track if a dj's in trouble hehe)


So whats the word on this space?  A sign in the small room said this was
the space's first event and it looks like they are 'opening up' for stuff.
I heard from someone else they wanted to do something 'regular' here. I
think that would be cool as shit. If they do do regular stuff I would
suggest atleast for the winter time to put a couple a space heaters in the
back rooms.  Too bad there isnt much they can do about the dust and decay
(I had bits of wall fall on me twice hehe)

well all, sorry i wasnt more talkative, but you know.....  (oooooo pretty
lights.... sorta mood)....  odd thing: first thing i got there i saw a girl
from youngstown that hits the computer labs at skool alot where i work....
kinda a surprise.

the partee was really good, i dont go to alot of them coz i generally dont
have a really good time, but the music was really good at this one!  the
djs were really good, and having the live acts was cool, but man was that
back room freezing!  trevor said they're going to do that on a monthly
basis, hope so!

the net.meet was the first really successful one we've had here,
interstellar outback and vibration were the only other successful ones i've
been at, usually a few ppl and thats that.  i'd like to get a pic of the
sign for the photo archive, just for evidence ;)   ....
at least now i have some faces to put to the names!  and glad to meet some
of ya!  (erica, jen, sonicarch, dan kelley)  

also the video screen was cool.  my friend hung out with those guys all
nite, he fell in love with the gadgets they had...   hehehheheee

whew... i am STILL recovering from an utterly amazing friday night in =
DC... SupahSting was a phat party... and even tho getting to DC was an =
adventure in itself... i left the party completely satisfied (even after =
a month long hiatus from party-land)=20

i got to the Capital Ballroom at around 11:30 w\ out tickets fearing =
that i'd have to wait on line for 2 hrs... well i didnt have to wait at =
all... security was up the ass as usual, and they were confiscating all =
open bags of candy.. (they took away all our sugar free gum.. and one of =
my friends is diabetic ...grrrrr!! ) they were also confiscating Vick's =
VapoRubs containers... but this was kinda good b/c i was able to swipe =
one from the pile while security wasnt looking.. we still had plenty of =
other candy tho so that wasnt so bad...

the coat check line was LONG........ i mean really REALLY long... and =
being that i was the only one w\ a coat.. (i had a pretty bad cold...) i =
opted to keep it w\ me the whole nite and just make sure someone was =
watching it...=20

the 1st dj i got to hear was feelgood... its funny b/c he usually goes =
on at 1 or 2 and he was spinning at 11:30... he did well as usual.. what =
a great way to start a party.. but i was more concerned w\ finding the =
rest of my friends (who had taken GRAYHOUND earlier that day...) the =
cool thing was that even tho there were supposed to be 5 or 6 of us... =
we were like 12 people all in all... (it was totally cool seeing people =
there who had told me only hrs earlier that they couldnt make it.. and =
the fact that we were driving down all the way from pittsburgh didnt =
help very much...

the only bit of drama  experienced came WAY early in the evening as i =
was looking around for my friends... back in early January (my 1st time =
at buzz and in DC for that matter) i had been thrown out for doing =
something bad in the bathroom.. or at least kind of attempting to do =
so... anyway.. of course the guy who threw me out has to recognize me... =
i saw him too, but by that time it was too late to change direction.. so =
i just kept walking... and someone taps me on the shoulder.. i kept =
walking.. he taps me again... i keep walking... finally i turn around.. =
and he's like "hey, i BANNED u....!!!!" i didnt say anything... i just =
looked at him w\ a confused look on my face... he continues: "i banned =
'cause u were being such an asshole last  time -- u wouldnt fucking =
leave" (and the truth was he was right.. i was giving him hard time.(the =
last time i was at Buzz)... but what was i supposed to do.. it was my =
1st time in DC.. and the kid i was w\ (Donny) didnt know i was thrown =
out.. so i wanted to let him know so we could both leave... and =
technically, the security dude didnt SEE me do anything..so i kinda felt =
justified in defending myself... so anyway.. i was just like.. "oh, =
c'mon man.." and he just looked at me fo like 10 seconds and was like.. =
"ok.. just BEHAVE.." and he let me go.. oh boy was i relieved... =
apparently, one of my friends had seen all of this from across the =
room.. but he was candy-flipping.. and it wouldnt have been wise to be =
around security at that time.. so he stayed away... but i seriously =
thought it was all OVAH.. i half expected that he'd pick me up and throw =
me out right then and there...

this party was the 1st time i've ever heard Aphrodity live.. i have like =
5 of his mix tapes tho.. and he is my fave joungle dj... well, he ROCKED =
IT!!!!! i cant stress this enough... i'm not really a joungle head... =
but i have this aperciation for the stuff.. and overall, i enjoyed the =
joungle at this party more than anything else... i also got to hear =
Jumping Jack Frost.. who i've never heard b4... and he was also simply =
AMAZING.. (he also spins joungle.. for those of u who care) Dara... =
another one of my fave dj's was there as well.. and  he rocekd it too... =
what can i say.. 8 hrs of the coolest, mindblowing joungle.. it rarelly =
gets better than this...

Roni size Represent (and co...) were really good... but they turned the =
main room (which is fairly big) into an overcrowded concert hall.. it =
was too crowded to dance.. and too crowded to move... the chick who did =
lead vocals was good.. but u couldnt understand a word she was saying =
b/c everything else was just kinda drowning her out.. Paul Oakenfold and =
Dave Ralph were not as good as i had expected... everyone i know was =
raving abt these two b4 the party.. and i was eager to hear them as =
well... but they were... less than exceptional... dont getme wrong... =
paul oakenfold is a godo dj.. adn he did well.. but it seemed like he =
played "met her at the loveparade" like 10 times... adding only a slight =
overlay or variation to the track... i mean its a great tarck and all.. =
and hearing t made us all o-so-happy -- the 1st time.. after that, it =
was kinda like... we just heard this... i felt bad for them b/c by the =
time they were finnishing up there were less people in the room than =
when they started.. which i would find totally depressing...

does anyone know what the deal is w\ Scott Henry??? he wasnt there =
AGAIN...he;s supposed to be the resident, but he wasnt at buzz when i =
went in january... and he hasnt been there a lot since then ... he wasnt =
even there for SupahSting.. what gives???

anyway, overall, the music was great.. i didnt spedmore than 20 mins in =
the small "CloudWatch" tent.. b/c it was SO small.. but it was nice to =
see a 3rd room w\ music...

the crowd was just great.. almost perfect... when i first got there i =
was kinda like: "this is great, these people dont look happy" so  i was =
kinda disappointed..also.. most of the faces were of people who i didnt =
know.. which is kinda wierd for me (the scene in pittsburgh is so small, =
that one can recognize almost everyone.. even in ny... you know u've =
partied w\ most of these people b4.. but i had only been to DC once =
b4...so it was a bit disorienting).. but most people seemed really =
friendly... i met so man cool people... it was great. This was also my =
first party where i walked around w\ out my shirt on... i usually dont =
like to do so, and even if i take my shirt off for a couple minutes, =
i'll put it back on b4 walking around... but after getting a great =
backrub (with VapoRub) from my friend amber i was siezed by an rget =
desire to go fill may waterbottle... so i just got up and left.. i didnt =
think abt my shirt... or anything... it wasnt until 5 hrs later when i =
realised maybe i should put my shirt back on.. still tho, it was a quite =
liberating experience.. we had a small netmeet by the broken =
waterfountain at 3:00... where i met Losnmimind from the nyc-raves list =
(hi kellie) she was real cool... sitting by the fountain as i walked up =
to her and kinda started asking questions (she was nice enough to send =
me a pic, but u never know..) wheni introduced myslefshe totally just =
jumped up and gave me this HUGE hug.. which felt totally great.. b/c its =
wierd when a total wierdo walks up to u and starts asking questions u =
know?? but she totally seemed not to care...  and she had a laminate too =
(i need to get myself one of those pretty soon..) Geoffrey, dude, i =
looked for u the whole night.. (i kinda know what u look like.. but =
wasnt sure.. were u there?? ) i also met this girl from DC raves.. i =
forget her name.. but she gave my a flier for a party called =
UNDERWORLD.. too bad its this thursday.... there was this other dude w\ =
an NE-RAVES t-shirt who i ran into totally unexpectedly... This one dude =
came up to me to ask me if he saw me at Lotus... (hi George!!) yea.. i =
didnt remember seeing him tho... i just remembered that i forgot to =
write a review for that one (3 words: great fucking party!!!) hanging =
out w\ him was quite amuzing... he's your typical hard guy.. w\ long =
blond hair in a pony tail and a british accent... he came up to me later =
in the evening and gave me this big ass hug.. which was totally =
unexpected.. b/c when i 1st met him he was way snotty..  =20
 apparently.. he was on 3 hits of e.. but he didnt know what kind... and =
i smiled and asked: "dude, are u rich??" ... but it was cool...
other people who i remember meating: glitter-girl, ryan -- (good-luck w\ =
the outlaw man), matt -- the dude who should be given a pair of =
clowsticks on da house... he does amazing things w\ 2 little lights.. =
and to all the others i've forgotten... my appologies u all helped for =
an amazing evening...

even tho i had 1st intended not to.. i did end up rolling.. i was sick =
tho. so i didnt knwo if this was such a  good idea.. i wasnt even sure =
i'd feel the e... but i did.. it kept me speeded the whole nite.. =
although i only peaked for abt 3 hrs.. (Which is kind of a shame)
  my friend danielle (who had only rolled once in her life b4 SupahSting =
was rolling for HOURS...on the same crowns as me) it was great to see... =
although she spent most of her time in the music-less chillout tent.. =
that room was way too crowded for me and i was too busy walking around =
giving out hugs and dancing.. i do wish i ghad spent a little bit more =
tinme sitting down.. my feet are KILLING me... i wish tho that the =
walkway around the tent wasnt there.. i was having trouble getting up =
that huge tent... but people tended to notice this and they would alway =
help me out.. which is way nice (in ny people just kind of stair at me =
like.. oh that dude is just a big fuck-up crackhead... even when i'm =
sober... ) it was nice to see semi-caring people all around... i even =
ran into the bouncer who had banned me and i could swear that was a =
smile one his face when he saw me...=20

overall, a great, great evening!! the DC scence kicks ASS.. even tho =
there were some guido club types there.. i even got pats on the back =
from some of them.. which was nice... i dont know when my next party is =
gonna be ... (most likely anothet Buzz) but i expect to see all of you =
at April Fools ... b/c that's gonna be insane... and i cant wait...!!!

like.. &quot;ok.. just BEHAVE..&quot; and he let me go.. oh boy was i=20
relieved... apparently, one of my friends had seen all of this from =
across the=20
room.. but he was candy-flipping.. and it wouldnt have been wise to be =

better clean that defecation up before it sets...

so much for keeping it on the "dl".  i just called the h.o.s. number to get
more information on CHEER and alas, vapourspace is here for an upcoming
event!!  and, i called it twice, so it wasn't a mishear. i now understand,
as i was growing up, friends would get excited because bon jovi was coming
to the civic arena and i'd be like "so the f%-k what?"  [i didn't have
anyone to get excited about =] ]

and a big apology goes out to those of you who "connected" at the first
octoannual pbcle net meet.  i understand that an integral part of the group
was missing, i feel that i missed out, and i hope we can all meet at cheer.

dialing again after this is sent,

Andrew

i think there was just one thing that sucked about the net meet, and 
that was the fact that once we all got there, we had no way of knowing 
who was who....name tags would have been cool....
anyway, i met mskw1 (i think thats the right #/letter combo), jen 
foulmood, johnny fingers, and erika......due to my general 
anti-sociality, i ended up chatting with my homies cut-up and absolut 
for most of the netmeet...oh well, maybe therell be as good of a turn 
out at cheer, ill bring name tags and ill wear mine from the beginning, 
so if you see me just tell me who you are and ill give you a tag......

i guess the big preflyers must have just come out because i got one
saturday. the whole design looks pretty amateur. the front is a
graffiti-style sketch in pencil, which isn't drawn particularly well, just
ok. if a flyer is going to have graffiti types of pictures on it, they
should at least be done in paint (and photographed and scanned), or in
marker, or done on the computer from the start. the pencil looks pretty
crappy. the back is done in 5 (FIVE!) dfferent fonts, including one
really obnoxious crooked, spiky serifed one. and it looks kind of just
thrown together. (go ahead call me a design snob ;) ) also there are 6
really obvious misspellings (i'm quoting now):

suberban knight
minnasota
boo willams
strickly jazz unit
dj assualt (2x)

i don't know if "kenneth grahm" is spelled like that or not. it's pretty
sad that somebody probably actually got paid to "design" this flyer. 
anyway, i would like to see dj assault + james pennington + woody mcbride,
but i doubt the whole thing would be worth it.

HAd fun at this party, though I missed the net meet cause i was helping
out at the door (I was really too tired to dance and was waiting for 
starchilds set).

Chris's set was dope ... danced a bit and just listened a bit ...
funniest thing was getting harrased by the man (aka millvales finest)
because I was
smoking American Spirits Pow-Wow blend (roll your own fag's :)

other than the place being friggin hard to find, cold and a little too
much ambient light for my taste, it was a pretty dope party.

RAVE THE PLANET:
i hadn't had time to go thru my e-mail for a while so i had no idea what
the line up was to this + i met this guy dave at the movies thursday night
+ he told me when it was. but our ride fell thru on fri, then sat night i
called my friend amy + she decided to go so we had a ride + dave's friend
rachel came too. anyway we got to the forking evil agora at about 10:30
and saw corrie + bryan there. the agora security people were kind of being
dicks + said take those chains + water bottles back to the car. so we hid
the chains in our pockets + corrie had a big pocket so she smuggled in a
water bottle for us (very cool). 

the music for the first few hours was almost all hard house, which is
alright for me for a short time, but it was in all 3 rooms at once a
couple times. i did hear a couple of DJs spinning some hard acid, which i
really got into, i never hear hard acid spun out anymore. =/ then at about
2, somebody came on in the ballroom-room spinning hardstep/jumpup, which i
was glad to hear just for the change in rhythm (although i wish it was
techstep =D ). everybody in that room was really getting down by then,
including me. later i went upstairs + realized i had just missed a techno
set which was disappointing, but lou (the guy throwing "space" i don't
know his stage name) went on then doing a live PA of superhard techno
which was so perfect to hear then, his music was really really good. he
should have be playing in one of the downstairs rooms, because there were
only a few people up there (+ i was the only person dancing half the
time). and in the main (theatre) room the music was so boring. it sounded
all the same everytime i had gone in there to check it out. but then i
realized somebody had stolen my stack of about 20 flyers i had collected,
so i was kind of mad, but right then i met this guy who had a lot of
flyers + he gave me his extras =] so it was ok. 

a little later, the good security guards (the ones hired by corrie +
bryan) directed everybody into the main room. the stage was packed with
tons of people + corrie was making a speech about focusing on love and
unity and music which was cool but i just heard the very end of it, then
she had several people introduce themselves on the stage and if they were
ravers, to say so. i don't understand the point of that, that sort of
thing seems like it divides us into opposing camps. i don't know what i
would have said if i had been asked. because if somebody asked me are you 
a raver i would say yes (although i haven't decided if that's the best
word). but also i am an artist, and a DJ, those things are at least as
important. we are a lot more complex than ravers + non-ravers, or
whatever. oh well...

the next DJ on was (fellow mw listmember!) trevor lamont. =] =] =] i think
he was a surprise guest or something. he spun his usual style of soulful
vocal house. at times it moved closer into hard house which i didn't enjoy
quite as much, but it was still a very good set, and excellently mixed, by
the way. (afterwards in the car my friends said trevor was the best DJ all
night) i was the person in the center in front of the stage blowing a
whistle + dancing + jumping + cheering + waving around a red strobe light
(at that time + the whole night earlier) so if you don't know me you might
have seen me. that was the first time i stayed in the main room + the
sound was really weird in there, because even though it didn't seem louder
than the sound at any other party of similar size, the bass was really
hard. it would vibrate thru the center of your body + it seemed to be
pounding me 1000x in the solar plexus. i am still sore there + there is no
other reason for it. so i just though that was very strange.

at the end of the party corrie said on the stage how much money they had
lost that night: $8000. she said there would be a jar for donations
by the door. i understand their motivations (if i lost $8000, i'd
practically feel like stealing it), but i don't know if that's (asking
even more with a $25 admission price) the right way to go about it, or if
there IS a right way. but, that's some serious money. and i believe it,
knowing the shadiness of the agora. the agora's people were taking the
money at the door until the profit was as much as they were supposed to
get. that's ridiculous. i think it's always bad when the space owners are
running the cashbox, or sometimes worse, getting a percentage of the
profit. who's to say they aren't pocketing some of it right there? 

then as 100s, maybe 1000s of people were slowly moving out of the space,
thru narrow doors, the agora security started yelling "get moving! get the
fuck out of here! move faster!" it was absurd. so much for good vibes.
anyway, i really wish better people ran that space. the 3rd floor room in
there is so nice. it had that perfect dark abandoned building atmosphere
with boarded up windows with cold wind blowing thru the room. there is
also a room on the 2nd floor that had a board covering the doorway + i
climbed up + looked over it + saw in there + it's really dirty and has
junk lying all over + broken out windows. i don't know if the floor would
hold up if you stepped on it though. but if that room was cleaned out +
the floor was ok, those 2 floors would make a nice space. anyway i
promised corrie i'd leave a message on their infoline with information
about better spaces. she said it's hard to look for them since they have
to find a babysitter for their son. hopefully i can find them a big
warehouse.

i got a preflyer for this party today ... 

it says vapourspace + dj flake on the headline, then it says alexi
delano, neuromancer, adam marshall, john selway (probably NOT the
superbowl mvp), mike bryant, point alpha, pure, instigator, and product
19.  

412.734.8427 (house of styles) - 416.760.3161 (phryl)

just fyi.

heyheyhey everybody...

about 27 (the h.o.s. rave in may)... check out:

http://www.phryl.com/27/

all the info you can eat... or if you'd rather have product 19 himself
read it to you, call de infoline 734.8427

-----

also: where's the followup to deep? where's the followup to
temptation? both were like "we'll be throwing more raves" and that was
it. its not very nice to lie like that, we want more raves, dammit.

-----

bigupda1like erica for throwin a really good first rave (and hopefully
not losing to much $ in the process)... keep em comin'. i wasn't in
attendence cause my parents are bitches :(, but i did go to that
grafitti art show/hiphop conert @ the turmoil room and tho it wasn't a
rave, it was dope. strict flow kicked it with their skillz and a phat
ass scratch dj called big john stud really cut it up. he was fuckin
amazin, havin a straightup party with all sorts of old skool shit like
apache, planet rock, rappers delight, nobody beats the biz, and all
those other songs you all know an love. i've never heard of the dude
before, but he had a minidiscplayer and he kept sampling all this shit
like "yo, dis is bizmarkie, and you're listen to the sounds of big
john stud" and he had his own opening dubplate (at least i think it
was a dubplate) that was pretty skilled as well. 2 puffs on a kb L and
i was good to go, doin dat hiphop-bobyahead dance till 1:00 ;)

-----

idea for house of styles' next party: you know the detergent "all"?
well... right underneath all it says "the stainlifter", so i was
thinkin', change it to "the massive" and throw an all jungle rave.
(for those who really dont know... mc's say "all the massive [inside]"
all the time).

...frankie g

ps - 3rd quarter for pps ends really early april... only one more to go!

Hey folks -
         I'm trying to get in touch with 187 reguarding some hush-hush
top secret stuff, but I'm not sure how to do so these days.  Anyone have
his secret email address or a phone # where I could reach him?  Joe - if
you read this list at all, email me: gmmst22@pitt.edu.

thanks much,

hey...

question: i wonder why no one on the list has mentioned the reprazent show
in cleveland on thursday...i guess its at the odeon? can some kind,
dear, sweet clevelander (kate, finephunk ;) please give us some details
about it namly *price* and times?

if it goes like the rest of the reprazent shows, itll be reprazent (roni
size, dj die, suv, krust, vocalist onalee, and mc dynamite (one of the
dopest mc's around period.) along with planet v which is jumping jack frost
and bryan g along with mc gq.

are you guys awake? :)

the other show is at st. andrews hall in dtroit on friday nite (which is
better for those of us with school/work)...the show there is only $5. and
there's a bar :)

i wonder how the dtroit crowd will compare to the cleveland show...neither
town is a bastion of junglism...so if anyone from pgh is willing to drive
to either show, i'll definitely be up for representing the 412 along with
you.  (read: begging for a ride)


i'd much rather drive 2.5 hrs to cleveland than 5 to dtroit...but then
again, i'd much rather go on a friday nite than a thursday nite and
consequently have to take off work.

so please tell me how much the show costs and whn it runs at the odeon. 

thank you for your time. :)

peace,
hossam

This show is at the Odeon in Cleveland (east bank of the Flats). I think
there is a bar although I have never been there. I believe the show is 10
bucks in advance and possibly 12 at the door. I don't know for sure who all
will be there but I am assuming the whole entourage because the ad says
Roni Size/Reprazent. The ad says 8pm.

for info you can call 1-888-ODEON88 
can purchase tickets through ticketmaster or through the box office. 
Ad says proper i.d. required so I don't know if it's all ages. 

I'll be there.


You're welcome Hossam,

Kate

here is what i think is going on.  deep was thrown by a guy named gene at
deep productions.  if this is not true, then everything else that follows
is probably also untrue.

the deep crew were considering opening the old "club kong" in monroeville
(a suburb of pittsburgh) to our scene on a weekly basis, in the style of 
capitol ballroom in dc, shampoo in philly, pleasure in cleveland, den of
thieves in nyc.  gene told me he was planning on premiering around new
year's with david morales; also he mentioned having booked uberzone ...

---
hm at this point i wondered why i was really posting this ... it's pretty
much worthless, i hate posting anything that has potential to flame into
rumors ... but i'm just saying that a guy named gene told me about this
spot he had plans for, and i think he's the head of deep productions, and
i think he threw the deep party last fall in pittsburgh.  i'm not calling
him a half-ass or braggadoccio ... it's just what he told me.

peace, love, unity, respect.

I saw that video, it was pretty cool, i liked the dj shadow, soulslinger
videos too.  Oh and the portishead video was so rad, course i'm a big fan,
so that's probably why i like it so much.

All the talk about the purpose of this list has finally inspired me to
write my first email to the list. I joined this list because the whole
rave scene and different styles of music was just introduced to me this
year by my good friend Brian and I liked what he played for me but I also
want to know who else my virgin ears would like to listen too. He
introduced me to 187, Daft Phunk, Diesel Boy, Roni Size and Dr.Octagon but
I want to know about others. So I ask all of you for suggestions of other
groups that are good enough to put forth the effort of hunting down their
music. 
	Hunting down music brings up another question for the Columbus
people: What record stores do you recommend in town? I have a nice cd
collection but I want to get a record player and start collecting some
bands on records but don't know where to go. I know my way around High St
so if you know of any shops in that area worth checking out I would
appreciate knowing about them. Obviously i'm not going to spin, just want
to listen to them. there is something about the old sound quality to
records that makes the listening experience unique. any
suggestions/comments would be very dope ass cool!!!

i'm not a columbus person, but i play one on TV! anyway, you probably
already know where world records is on high st (by campus + mcdonalds),
they have the biggest selection. they have lots of techno and house and
some hip-hop and a bunch of other non-ravey/party/dance music that i never
pay attention to. the last time i was there the jungle section was pretty
small + they only had a few breakbeat records but maybe there are more
now. they have 2 turntables there + you check out the headphones for them
by leaving your ID with the person working there.

then there's used kids records in the basement of what i think is the same
building. most of their records are...yes...used. they don't really have
any techno/house/etc. normally, but once in a while you can find something
cool there. i got a 2 record set of 4 tracks that are on the history of
our world pt 1 tape (old school breakbeat) for $5 there, plus the records
are clear 10" one is blue + one is red so they look neat as a bonus. i
found them in the soul section because that's where i was looking for
parliament + funkadelic. no turntables (i think).

while you are there, stop upstairs in burritos as big as your head, for
really huge yummy burritos that are authentically mexican.

then there is culture 7 records. they are located north of there on high 
st in the 1st suburb you hit as you go out of columbus (i forget what it
is called). the address is 5000 something. it is on the right (east side
of the st) and in a shopping center (weird). they have a pretty good
selection and variety. there is a very small section of happy hardcore +
old school breaks. they have 1 turntable there with headphones, near the
back.

those are all the record stores i know of that are in columbus. they are
all worth checking out.

Does this mean finefunk was outted?  ;)

There are two very fine record stores in Columbus.  I am sure there
are a couple of others, but the campus stores are mostly rock these
days.  There was another one for awhile, but, alas, I can not
remember its name.

First on Culture 7 with absolutely *NO* kissing ass.
Culture 7 has been around for close to 10 years (formerly from Cinci).
Andy Starr and Andy Reynolds made the name Culture 7 a tradition for dj's
in the midwest.  Everyone I know made a chart for them at some point in
time.  The guys in Columbus did an EXCELLENT job of moving them to Cow
Town.  Fred, Pat, Doug, and everyone else....JOB WELL DONE.  You would
have to drive to Chicago to get the same kind of atmosphere....and C7 is
BIGGER than grammaphone.  There are very few record stores that are
staffed with competent Dj's and they carry ALL types of music.  It doesn't
matter if you are a cheeseball jock, club jock or a party jock.....C7 has
something for you.  Probably more than just something!  I also heard that they are
expanding the d&b sections, though unfortunately this will probably mean
less turntable time for the rest of us.  (If you spend much time in record
stores you know what I mean ;))

World Record is also well worth the mention.  Nick finds obscure records
better than ANYONE in the midwest.  Bust buyer around, IMHO.   World
carries alot of independant lables, which C7 sometimes misses.  

Both stores have listening booths.  World has 2 turntables, and C7 has at
LEAST 4.

Both stores are well worth the trip if you get there on "order day".
World used to get the bulk of their stuff on Wednesday, while C7 gets it
on Wednesday and Thursday.  

If you are trying to compare either of these stores to anything that
Cleveland has, well, you just can't.  The dance section at World is
slightly better than Deep was.  Both being better than the Crayon.  C7 is
like crayon, downtown and poobah's mixed times 10.  If you spend 30
dollars a week in Cleveland, you will spend 70 in Cow Town.  So for what
it is worth, Cleveland should be ashamed.  Too much attitude.


THANKS FOR THE OPPOURTUNITY TO VENT ONCE AGAIN

Yes dr cutup, I'm here but by now you know that. Steph and I were in Miami
for the Winter Music Conference a little over a week from the 6th-15th.
Aaaahh I can't wait for warm weather now. Hangin at the beach has spoiled
me. I think a move may be in order ;-) By the way, Toby (Farmer Tea) and
Amie (grrl13) now firmly South Beach Miami residents send their love. As
fow what I have been up to, well as you all know there is a new album about
to come out, and a new video about to air and I made URB magazine's "The
Next 100", When Worlds Collide has outsold any other Liquid Sky CD and I
was interviewed at the MTV AMP House at the Winter Music Conference (blah
blah). Inevitably there is going to be alot of press and stuff or perhaps
not... You see I've reevaluated my life a bit (amayzing what swimming in a
warm ocean will do). And I think you are all going to be a bit suprised
over the next  two years.  I  can only promise you this, the insanity has
only begun. I plan to take control over my life and hopefully help the
scene back towards the ideals that brought me there in the first place. I
have a fight ahead as there are forces of darkness in and among us. I know
this sounds like some really wack new age crap but it is true. Are scene
was sabotaged not by MTV but by US ravers, dj's, promoters, etc LONG before
most people even knew what a rave was. I'm talking 1993 folks.  Is it any
wonder that what used to be a scene made up of what would now be termed
"candy ravers" has become nothing more than a place where alot of people
who's biggest distinction from "the rest of society" is that they listen to
Armand Van Helden, or Goldie instead of Eddie Van Halen or Garth Brooks?
I've noticed alot of people here in the past couple of weeks discussing
Kay. Let me just say that Kay is one of the few people who stuck to what
they believed this thing was all about and didn't care what anyone thought.
I admire her if for nothing else than she is true to herself. As the new
millenium approaches I think we would all stand to be true to are selves.
Not gloss over the crap that goes on in the scene but actually do something
to correct it. PLUR can only exist with the R: Respect for everyone
involoved in the scene no matter what their backround is. If this sounds
like preachy cryptic rambling i am afraid I cannot elaborate any more until
my forces of good are in place and strong enough to fend off the attacks
that are sure to be leveled against me and friends. Rest assured that Truth
will always overcome repressive hypocrisy. The end is near folks. Start
thinking of whose side you'll be on.

Whas up yall,
My name is jason and i am new to this list. just wanted to say hey from
columbus.
In response to the question "Does this mean fine funk was outed?" i am
assuming u meant perveyors of fine funk's hometown hero and no, he is slated
for next week, april 1st.  My friend and Itake care of the bookings for
wednesday nights at Maxwells 3 times a month, basically other than when the
World record guys do there bigger things.  The cost is only 1 dollar if u r
over 21 and 2 if your not.  Look for flyers soon regarding april lineup.
TOnight we have Mellowman, Doughboy, and Lemonlyman(me ;->) Next week its me,
james temple and Bob Sfero.  It really is a fun time, especially for a buck...
Thanks,
Lemon

parties they were but still parties. Then in August of 1994 I threw
Clevelands first Big scale party  at the Armory. We called it "REBIRTH" and
it was an awsome show!!(Rob sherwood and Mike Filly threw 2 fairly big
parties a bit before rebirth, I believe they were called "Title rave" and
"Kool aid" both were slammin and led to Psychoactive doing Rebirth.)

Psychoactive continued to throw parties for the next few years...(ie. musik
1, musik 2, musik 3, Rebirth 2, Metamorphsis, Deep into it, ect.and many
smaller parties and free events.)

In 1996 I decided to work with Spawntaneous (who had thrown a few parties
by themselves, ie. No shit,Burning of illusions, social disfunction ect.)

We decided to do 4:20. This was the first time I worked with Spawntaneous,
and one of only 4 times. (ie. road to 4:20, 4:20, 7:20,and  4:20 II)

Spawntaneous has a different style of doing parties than I do, and attract
a different crowd for the most part, so we figured if we worked together,
we could attract his crowd and mine and get a massive party happening.

This worked for the first 4:20, twas a great party, but at this point I
could see Spawntaneous's faults.... Great idea man, no business skills. We
lost $45,000 on 4:20 I.

Because of this debt, I was kind of stuck working on 7:20, and 4:20 trying
tp recoup some of the loot I lost.

But since then, Psychoactive has been doing stuff on it's own again, (ie.
Fall Classic, Musik the weekly, and now planning a Richie Hawtin party, and
Rebirth 3)

So please note that Psychoactive and Spawntaneous are 2 seperate enties,
and that Psychoactive will not be apart of 4:20 III this year.... even if
Spawntaneous feels the need to put my production companies name on the
flyer!!

Sorry if this message didn't interest you, but if it did, there's the story!

Peace,
Sleepy C

you dont see them often,  and alot of times, they're not given the proper
viewing location,   i liked them alot at planet bass, except that they
were on a side wall.  the best setup i've seen is the one at the partee in
cleveland that had rabbit in the moon where the screen was MASSIVE and
behind the djs/performers.  you could take it all in without looking off
to the side.

well my friend eric wants to throw a partee and he did talk to you
fellows, he really dug what you did and wants to have you at it, but it
remains to bee seen if he'll actually throw one.
(btw, i was the kid w/ the blue hair hanging out checking out the gear)

Hi all,
I just found out about this graffiti through my friend...
My name is U'sey, and I am the guy who mixed the video images at the
planet bass on march 13th. I am really happy to hear that so many people
loved my images. I been quite a few parties past 2 years or so. AND I
noticed that there's really dont have good video works. DJs were always
nice and strong but the images were poor.  I believe that if the images
are strong as the DJs' then, party become more solid and strong. I also
noticed that nobody mixed the videos at the party. They usually pre
rerecorded before hand, and they just play 'em. I thought that is kinda
boring and I knew DJ is not the only people who can mix stuff.
(Although, Dj is something beyond my world...i cant never figure it out
how they mix music loke that...) So, i mixed at live. 

well, I am sorry for the long non sense mail, but I am willing do more
VJ andi know i can make it more perfect for next time. so please let me
know for next party. I can send my work if people wish to watch it.

Thank you,
U'sey

Hey folks-
  I made a video myself also, and was hoping to use it for our next event. I am
looking to get a projector or something. Does anyone know where you can rent
one and a screen for pretty cheap??

to add to what kate said,

the odeon *does* have a bar.  the 'proper id required' probably refers 
to drinking only, but don't quote me on that.

i'm planning on being there tonight as well and hope to meet some folks 
since i still haven't met many since being in cleveland.  i'll probably 
be wearing a pb-cle raves badge around my neck.  so if you see me (i'm 
6', brown hair, eyebrow pierce) come say hi.

anyone going to see freaky chakra at the odeon sat. march 28th (opening 
up for curve)?  i'm kind of surprised i haven't heard anyone talking 
about this one.

peace
solarvibe

Sorry for the off topic posting, but many of you who are about to graduate
(or are simply looking for work) might be interested in this.  It's free
and you can register at the door with a resume:

I wanted to announce a *major* career fair that's coming up this Friday.

The name of the event is the CATCHY Job Fair.  CATCHY is an acronym for
Cleveland Akron Toledo Canton Huron and Youngstown -- CATCHY. 

You can get more info at the web site: http://www.dezines.com/web/catchy/

(Even if you can't make it, your info will be shared with the recruiters.)

Here are the details:

* The CATCHY Job Fair is taking place Friday, March 20th from 3:00 to 7:00
P.M. at the downtown Cleveland Sheraton Hotel.

* The Sheraton is located at 777 St. Clair between E. 6th and E. 9th.

* The career fair is in the Grand Ballroom on the 6th Floor.  Business
casual or even casual attire is acceptable (remember it's Friday).

* Several hundred jobs will be available!  (Full time, part time and
summer internships too). 

* Please bring many copies of your resume -- there will be close to 40
companies there.  Most of the companies in attendance are either
computer/IT consulting firms, Fortune 500 or up and coming stars. 

* There will also be some sales, customer service and managerial
opportunities. 

* It's FREE!

* Everyone is welcome!  For more info, e-mail me at: "catchy@aimhere.com"
or call (216) 491-4600. 

* You may register online at: "http://www.dezines.com/web/catchy/"

* If you can't find street parking, the most you'll have to pay is $1.50
at that time of day.  The Galleria lot would be my choice.

* Free hors d'oeuvres.

If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me. 

Thanks,

Braden Albert
ACM

		TITANIC SUMMARIZED

Scene 1 -

KATE WINSLET: Why, this is a fancy boat, isn't it?

KATE'S WEASELLY FIANCE: Yes it certainly is. Here is the art you asked 
for. It is by an artist named "Picasso." I am certain he will amount to 
nothing.

KATE: Ha ha ha. That is very funny to our 90's audience, because they 
know these priceless paintings will sink with the boat.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO: Hello, I'm Leonardo DiCaprio. Perhaps you have seen 
the many Internet sites dedicated to the worship of me. You are very 
pretty.

KATE: Thank you. So are you.

LEONARDO: I know. Prettier than you in fact. I am going to put on my
"brooding" face now, to ensure that women will keep coming back again 
and again to see this movie. Later, my white shirt will be soaking wet.

KATE: While you're doing that, I will concentrate on standing here and
looking pretty, to keep the men in the audience interested until the 
boat sinks and people start dying.

WEASELLY FIANCE: Excuse me. I do not like you, Leonardo, even though you 
saved my fiancee's life. I am going to sneer at you and treat you like 
dirt because you're poor, and then I'll probably be physically abusive 
to my fiancee, and then, just to make sure the audience really hates me, 
and to make sure my character is entirely one-dimensional, perhaps I'll 
throw an elderly person into the water.

AUDIENCE: Boo! We hate you! Even though all real people have at least a 
few admirable qualities, we have not been shown any of yours, and plus, 
you're trying to come between Leonardo and Kate, and so therefore we 
hate you! Boo! (Even though technically it is Leonardo who is coming 
between you and Kate. But Leonardo is handsomer than you, even though he 
is only 13, so we are on his side. Boo!)

Scene 2 -

LEONARDO: I'm glad we snuck away like this so that you could cheat on 
your fiance.

KATE: So am I. Even though I am engaged to him and have made a 
commitment to marry him, that is no reason why you and I cannot climb 
into the backseat of a car and steam up the windows together. The fact 
that I am the heroine of the movie will no doubt help the cattle-like 
audience forgive me of this, though they would probably be VERY angry 
indeed if my fiance were to do the same thing to me.

AUDIENCE: Darn straight we would! Moo! We mean, Boo!

LEONARDO: I agree. First, I would like to draw you, though, so of course 
you have to take off your clothes.

KATE:But can a movie with five minutes of continuous nudity be at all
successful in say, Provo, Utah, where the audiences might not stand for 
that sort of thing?

LEONARDO: I would be willing to bet that for the first three weeks the 
film is in release, every single showing at Wynnsong Theater in Provo 
will sell out.

NARRATOR: According to Wynnsong manager Matt Palmer, that is exactly 
what happened.

KATE: All right, then. (Sound of clothes hitting the floor.)

Scene 3 -

FIRST MATE: Captain, we're about to hit an iceberg.

CAPTAIN: Great, I could use some ice for my drink. (Sound of drinking.)

ICEBERG: (Hits boat.)

FIRST MATE: That can't be good.

CAPTAIN: Bottoms up!

AUDIENCE: (Silence.)

FIRST MATE: That was irony, you fools.

AUDIENCE: Where's Leonardo?

Scene 4 -

LEONARDO: I have been informed that this boat is sinking.

KATE: That is terrible.

LEONARDO: Would you like to engage in some more immoral-but-justified
behavior?

KATE: Certainly.

WEASELLY FIANCE: (Aside) I'm getting the raw end of the deal here! (to
Leonardo) Listen, Leonardo, to cement my morally dubious yet somehow 
less annoying than you personality, I am going to handcuff you to this 
pipe, here in a room that will soon be filling with water, due to the 
fact that we are sinking, which I believe has been mentioned previously.

LEONARDO: Why don't you just shoot me?

WEASELLY FIANCE: Because then you wouldn't be able to escape and save 
Kate from me. Of course, you're going to die anyway...

AUDIENCE: Don't spoil it for us! Boo!

LEONARDO: He's right, though. I am doomed.

AUDIENCE: Aww, look how cute he is when he's doomed.

WEASELLY FIANCE: I hate you people.

Scene 5 -

150-YEAR-OLD-KATE: And that's when Leonardo rescued me from my evil 
fiance and helped me float on a board in the water. Of course, if it 
hadn't been for having to rescue him, I could have gotten on an actual 
lifeboat, and not frozen my legs nearly off. Anyway, he's pretty much 
dead now, and I'm well over a thousand years old, and who's making my 
supper? I need a bath. Turn down that Enya music, it's making my ears 
hurt. You kids today, with your loud music. Why, when I was - hey! Don't 
you walk away from me! I'd turn you over my knee, if I had one.  I'll 
beat you in the head with this huge diamond! Come back here!

(Fade to black. Roll credits and play annoyingly overplayed Celine Dion 
song.)

Just got back from the roni size/ reprazent show.  If you have any
respect for DnB and you missed the show I feel very sorry for you.  I
actually didn't know what to expect-seriously i didn't know who the cat
even was.  but they rocked the house!

The whole set-up had like eight people altogether.  They had a real
drummer, and a real stand-up bass.  It was sweet!  All I gotta say, is
that if you can take the place of a drum machine you  got some serious
rhythm!

Anyhow I defiantly enjoyed myself.  Does anyone have any idea when LTJ
Bukem/Logical Progression are coming through the states?  I gotta catch
that one this year.

Went last night to Hypersonics, finally met the Instigator, he's really one
cool dude. He came and sat down, introduced himself, and bought me a drink
like out of the blue... At any rate, He said that next thursday, Hypersonics
should be all-ages again (18+?) He said that the owner of Chameleons was
gonna meet with the LCB today and find out for sure, and to call Hypervynl
to find out :) I'm hoping business will pick up there cause I like the space
and music and all :)

Think I'm coming down w/da flu :(

as far as dope dragon and mask material goes they only did "square
off".......i was hoping for "dictation" but no luck...the part where they did
all the v,full circle and dope dragon stuff was by far the highlight of the
show in my opinion.

I dont mind to ruffle any feathers but, I recently talked to a connection
at Grand Royal Records and he said that the Beastie Boys were not going to
be anywhere near Pittsburgh on May 2 for GBB. 
	If someone can tell me different, please do. I really want to see them,
but as far as I can tell, a reliable source from Grand Royal says they are
not. If anyone has questons email me.

bounce therory's last party (their first?) was a complete joke. not to
mention over half of the line-up for this party was there. it was probably
one of the most unorganized and hastily thrown together parties i've been
to in a couple of years. i wouldn't hold my breath on Adam X or Heather
Heart either...

i have also spoken to a # of dj's whose names are on the line-up who never
even spoke to this promoter about the party and have never even been told they
were being put on the flyer.

i must also say when i met the promoter she did not seem as if she even had
the dough for 2 dj's let alone the Beastie Boys.
other people on this list can tell u that i have even wrote letters to them in
the past about this subject and i told them as well i did not want to come out

i know as well.....even last night at roni size i talked to Kevin Cunningham

the same to say......

This party just seemed impossible from the start - in pittsburgh or
anywhere.  Maybe they wanted to do this - but i can't imagine how anyone
could pull it off without major $'s and connections.  The webmaster or
promoter just wrote me the other day saying that its on, and the only
cancellation is Delta 9...although I read somewhere that the Beasties are
going on a European Tour in June...so who knows if they could even
possibly do a pgh date in may.....?

Okay.  Lots of shit surrounding this event.  From the mouth of the main
who claims he put the deposit down for the BBoys:  "I can't advertise them
in any other means besides flyers, and word of mouth (as this is).  They
are playing without permission of the record label, so it can't be
officially promoted as such an event".  Now, mind you, this comment was
made three months ago.  Be it true, or be it another shadey promoter... it
does make sense.  I can say out of fact... that several people I know were
asked to spin, and are not on the flyer or otherwise.  I seem to remember
a party in the Akron/Kent area awhile ago where a big act similar to
Beastie Boys was booked....and they did show up.  So take that for what
for what its worth.


ALSO:  When I said finefunk was outted, I *MEANT* that in the post for the
April 1 party it was said that FINEFUNK is MIKE FILLY.  BTW, mike... that
stupid ass aol... watch out when you are sending personal replys to the
whole newsgroup.

That seems soo bizarre, yet very interesting - what was their sound
setup/sequence like?  Any djs along? Or just one long thing?  All live or

i'm just gonna stick up for the promoter here... i dont know her ALL

throw together a phat-ass event as her first rave ever

it was nice but got old after a couple songs(some may disagree)...they had
live drummer going to a beat track and a stand-up bass player who was very
interesting along with some live percussion and a vocalist..the rest was off
computer or dat machine..the mixing board never had more than 5 tracks going
at once!...i kept peeking.
before the show Nick Popa from canton did a techno set with Jumpin Jack
Frost(UK) following...some people were upset with the dj set but there was no
monitor for him to mix with..he still held the majority of mixes....the
soundmen at the odeon also didnt think it was necassary to have the sound up
loud enough for the dj sets either.
i went with 2 other people...1 thought it was the mostr amazing thing they saw
in theyre life and the other was yawning like myself after the 3rd or 4th
track....

Just to clear things up.  The person who told me they put the deposit was
a guy.   And again, this was close to three months ago.  Also, I was *NOT*
in any way shape or form trying to diss or talk bad about a promoter.  I
was simply stating all aspects, and trying to get people to look at every
angle.  But I have been told a billion times that will never happen on
this list.  Sad.

Also, someone asked me why Beastie Boys would have to get permission from
their own lable.  Trust me, the way this industry works... stranger things
have happened.  And isn't Grand Royale part of a larger label?  Oh well.

I recently got this straight from England.  Its pertty good, but
unluckily, (at least in me and frankie-g's repetoire) the only song that
works well is hi-potent.  adn it does rock.  It is a five pack vinyl, and
all the songs are good, but the majority aren't playable.

Maybe you missed the post about this.  It stated that the performance
wasn't recognized by their label cause that would cost a lot of money or
something.  that would explain why Grand royal thinks they aren't going
to be in pgh.

I don't know what the entire situation is, so I don't really have an
opinion on whether or not the acts are confirmed or whatever.  But when I
talked to her on the phone a while ago, she said that she talks to freaky
flow all the time, and he was siced about coming and same with somebody
else big.  Maybe she was lying, but whatever.  Also remember that was
just the preflyer.  Shit changes all the time, so maybe that was just her
preliminary line-up but not confirmed.  Whenever the real flyer comes
out, then we can really see whether people are actually going to make it
or not.

Also, I understand where you are coming from in that last message, except
for saying that she doesn't look like she has enough dough for 2 DJs let
alone the beastie boys.  That's pretty fucking stereotypical.  I mean,
just because someone doesn't dress in designer clothes or isn't very
superficial doesn't mean they don't have money.  Also I don't think she
is throwing it by herself, so maybe there is a pool of funds, or a whole
bunch of people are putting there money in to make it happen.  who knows.

im just sayin.....in order to have a space large enought to accomodate 
such a thing plus multiple soundsystems, multiple light setups, security 
for that large of a venue....and then add on all of the dj's plus the 
beastie boys.......thats ALOT of $$$$$!!!!!! that would be about 
$10,000+ im just sayin....it looks unrealistic to me, but i wont be the 
stupid one without a ticket the day of it....i saw the beasties in 
'94....theyre so awesome....they were the best live act ive ever seen...
i think it would be funny as hell if the rpomoter just got a whole bunch 
of her friends to dress up as the beastie boyz crew and lip-synch to a 
live concert boot leg of theirs....then got random people to dress up as 
the famous dj's and play along to one of their mixtapes.....thatd be 
funny

tonight dronetek is throwing together a little renegade...its going to be
taking place at the same warehouse where Klepton was (400 East 2nd Ave).

Quick Directions:

>From the S take 71 N, from the N take 71 S
>From the E or W take 70 to 71 N

take the 11th Ave exit, make a right onto 11th Ave. (from the N make a
left)

drive a couple of blocks to Cleveland ave, take a right and follow
Cleveland ave S for 10 blocks, to 2nd ave.

go right on 2nd ave and find 400 e. (2nd ave on the R.) just start looking
for a concrete loading ramp you drive up, its before a railroad overpass.

admission is of course free, and if you want to spin just show up with
your records, we'll make a slot available for you. things will probably
kick off around 10:30-11 and go till ?

expect mostly evil jungle and dark techno.

So wait, there are two parties in Columbus tonight?  I'm holding a flyer for
"All Good" with Ren and Stimpy on it, info line 614-523-8085.  $15 w/ canned
good.  This is the first I've heard of this other party... hmmm... just
pointless pondering.

I'm probably going to "All Good"...

$10,000..... dude, the beastie boys would be at least $10,000, plus $7000
for lighting & sound that could accomidate the beasties, not to mention the
space - ($1500 - $3000) plus the proper security, $1000 plus many many
unseen , uncalculated expenses. Oh yea flyers, and travel.... this shit
would be like a 4:20 , costing like $60,000. If it happens I'll really be
suprised!

For real . . . I mean, when John Bromage threw Bounce I believe he
invested like 6K and that was at a small well known venue with only one
room and not the best DJs in the world or anything.

ABSOLUT

hey kiddies, my estimation of 10,000 was upfront.....according to what 
ive heard, the upfront is about 1/3-1/2 of the total cost....i may be 
wrong, but thats what john told me.......but anythin over the upfront 
can at least be partially covered by the door and water sales etc....the 
10,000 was the loot they just had to come up with from wherever...seen?

adding my 2 cents into the mix:


>im just sayin.....in order to have a space large enought to accomodate 
>such a thing

i talked to a kid at Cyber eX who knew the promoter (i don't know who 
she is) and he said that it was going to be in a mall complex with the 
djs separated into the different rooms/former stores.  

i dunno. that's just what i heard, and it seems as though that's all 
that's going around: mere speculation.....

Although this set up may be "mere speculation", isn't it a nifty idea?  I
know that while it's easy to come up with different off-the-wall spaces,
it's often hard to procure them.  
Oh good luck, good luck, good luck!! May the promoter find a new and nifty
space!

There was suppose to be a party at an airport hanger years ago:)   BUT!  The
cops quickly and suddenly closed it down due to "security reasons" :-)  

Just my 2 cents:)

hear the more shady this whole thing sounds...i subscribed today
(just for this purpose) but i've been reading your archives and it doesn't
seem like anyone knows what's going on..is this what its like in your
scene?

could someone at least answer this for me....

Here's a message i got from their webmaster a few weeks back.
I think the truth is, nobody on this list knows 100% sure if this will go
down, but many have been told that it will.  I say call the info line,
email this person, or wait a few weeks for a main flyer.  Your guess is
good as the next persons.

Now i think we should stop with the opinions & rumors (i'm as guilty as 
anyone) and move on? :)

Just curious...has anyone tried contacting the Beastie Boys or the Record
Label..? Im sure there is a webpage that allows you to send mail. I mean why
not contact them personally..screw the rumors and just get down to business.
If anyone has tried doing this ( I don't wanna be the 20th jackass sending the
same question ) or if anyone thinks that this might be a good idea..then I
will send an e-mail to the Beasties or the Label..couldn't be that hard..but
then again what do I know.

Love, Amy

I don't know how stupid the rave community has gotten when they actually
have faith in a promoter that lists the Beastie Boys on a pre-flyer and
then doesn't stand up to their word...

people who do shady shit like that should be taken out back

so is it save for me to assume that either 1) these people have not thrown
anything in the past to make them worthy of their word or 2) you
pittsburgh people have no idea what's up or down in your city

all i know is if someone asked me...hey, is nyc-joe-promoter-guy legit or
what...i'd be able to give a straight answer..none of you seem to have a
clue.  if this person/persons have never done anything ever and they're
just coming out saying "we've got the beastie boys!!" i'd be a little
suspicious too. can't ANYONE give me some info on these peeps?  i.e. have
they ever thrown ANYTHING in the PAST large enough to place some faith in?

I'm sorry I didn't clarify my statement.  I went to at least one of the
parties in the strip-mall space, and honestly, I didn't think it was that
bad.  It was heated for at least the time that I was there.  It wasn't so
dirty that you went home sneezing black goo (no disrespect to the PB
space, I liked that one, too).  It had ample room for dancing AND
chilling, as well as a second room.  It was kind of spooky gettin' down
an' funky in an old DIRT mall.

I guess I was having some weird wet dream about seperate open spaces (i.e.
abandoned stores in a mall) that each had its own dj and style of music.
With the large central space housing the headliners (regardless of who
they are).  I don't usually like colossal parties, but that just seems
kind of neat in an odd, commercialism sort of way.

It's more of a different use of a space, rather than a different space
altogether.  Sorry about the confusion and scorn that resulted.

the beastie boys suck ass...who cares if they paved the way?  =]  i'm just
kidding; i am just suprised that the entire active list appears to be
infatuated with them -- what attracts you to them?  if anyone out there
could provide some resistance or abeastie conversation, i'd be astonished.

man, licence to ill was the first album i ever bought.....it was such a 
shock to hear somethin like that when i was 6.....first grade and i knew 
lyrics about shootin betty crocker......i mean, it was just so cool 
cause no one in my school at the time liked them, and i was a little 
first grader (it was a catholic school that went to 8th grade)
i guess alot of why i like that album is sentimental, but their recent 
ones (check yer head, and ill communication) show alot of skills and 
maturity from them in the old days....its kind of amusing to look at the 
kind of drugs they did as opposed to the music....
licence to ill- drinkin, speed...as evidenced by the anger and energy
pauls boutique and check your head- acid....i know youve seen the video 
for "so whatchya want"??? nuff said
ill communication-WEED(and lots of it, i think)...the buddhist 
references, plus the general laid back feel...
its funny to see how the drugs influenced them...

yes, carolyn.. i'm pretty sure that it would be safe to assume that.
I've never heard of their group, nor is there one promotion group in
pittsburgh that has or has ever had the power to bring in the Beastie
Boys.

FYI, while visiting the Grand Royal site recently, I found out that the
new album should be out sometime in June.

It's about time!

Also, the 30th marks the date for the new Tribe Called Quest album, which
I've heard it a break back to their old school feel.  Apparently Q-Tip and
Phife didn't like Beats Rhymes and Life *themselves* that much, and are
wanting to bypass all current rap trends and bringing it back to Midnight
Marauders/Low End Theory vibes...

fuck yes.. :)

um.... someone already said that they would have to go around their
record label to do the gig, so the record label wouldn't know (and if
they are not supposed to know, i dont think 20 or so pb-cle headz
emailing em would do much good). rumor: my friend SAW the contract w/
the beastie boys.

I just wanna be able to get my groove on for a few hours, and THEN have
the Beastie Boys break it down at 4:20??? How damn cool would that be? :)
Anyways...that's why I wanna go..

drinkin', smokin' weed, smokin' whoolers (weed/dust)

"...went in to the bathroom roller myself a whooler"
"sit round the house, gettin high, watch the tube, eatin colonel's
chicken, drinkin' heinekin' brew"

weed, dust, ecstacy, various crazy shit, acid

"...smokin that dust @ st. anthony's feast"
"...i had a beautiful experience on esctacy
    i smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer..."
"...hey, i think im starting to peak now, al!"
the sound of science (nuff said for those who know)

> and check your head- acid....i know youve seen the video 
> for "so whatchya want"??? nuff said

weed, acid, and weed

the last song on the album (nuff said for those who know, check the
bottom of the message for those who dont)
"A little puffy so you know what I'm doin' right"
the video for so whatchya want (like tom sad)

> ill communication-WEED(and lots of it, i think)...the buddhist 
> references, plus the general laid back feel...

you see, here's where the beasties get a wee big mature with their old
age. one of em (the hardcore buddhist) stops smokin' weed and drinkin
altogether. the other two (i think) get married, and there isn't much
room in a marraige for large amount of acid, weed, dust, etc... unless
the marriage is just generally crazy. anwyas, a few of em are still
smokin, but ill communication is definitely the least drug-influenced.
by this album they have COMPLETELY shed their badasstoughguy images
(carryin' guns + all dat).

one beastie rappin bout the weed:
"I'm Feeling Strong See, Trust Myself G. Well I Stopped Smoking
Cheeba, And That Was Part Of The Key."
another beastie rappin bout the weet:
"legalize the weed and i'll say thank heavens"

> its funny to see how the drugs influenced them...

true, true... i think that ill communication went pretty far downhill,
tho. its my least fave of all 4. i mean, its got it highlights (sure
shot, the one with qtip/biz markie, flute loop, etc.) but a lot of it
is just in your face beats with all three of em yellin at you through
shitty distorted mics. license to ill + paul's botique are kinda up in
your face with the drug shit, but it's all just part of their lyrical
skillz... as for check ya head, its just obvious that the drugs are
there.

and now the lyrics of namaste (the last song on check your head)

     A butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day
     As I feel this reality gently fade away
     Riding on a thought to see where it's from
     Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come
     Smoke paints the air
     Swirling images through my mind
     Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind
     And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting
     As time slips by
     Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky
     And I sit
     And I think to myself
     And on the horizon the sun light begins to climb
     And it seems like it's been so long since he shined
     But I'm sure it was only yesterday

     A cold chill of fear cut through me
     I felt my heart contract
     To my mind I brought the image of light
     And I expanded out of it
     My fear was just a shadow
     And then I voice spoke in my head
     And she said dark is not the opposite of light
     It's the absence of light
     And I thought to myself
     She knows what she's talking about
     And for a moment I know
     What it was all about.

nuthin' but love...

yeah... i hate to say it, but it seemed like another "we're gettin'
old" fatality. they almost completely lost their sense of humor beats,
rhymes, and life, and on most of their other albums (at least the ones
i've heard), they are just straight cut-ups.

I just heard a rumor that MICHAEL JACKSON is going to be at the getto
booty battle and it is going to take place in a secret undergound missle
silo built by the government underneith the rivers!  There will also be
virtual reality helmets for everybody at the rave so that each person
gets their own lightshow and virtual environment!

they never printed on the pre-flyer that the beastie boys are going to be
there.  It might say it on the webpage, but still, they haven't not stood
up to their word yet even if they did have it on the pre-flyer.  People
are making all sorts of assumptions.

Hello, I'm writing to you as a representative of the pb-cle mailing list.
 There has been a lot of discussion on the event you maintain the webpage
for, the Getto Booty Battle and there are many doubts and worries. 
People are attempting to set up rides already, and would like to know
some definites.  In order to not cast away these people, I would suggest
getting on the pb-cle mailing list yourself so as to dispell any
misinformation etc.

To subscribe, send email to majordomo@hyperreal.org with

  subscribe pb-cle-raves

in the body.  To unsubscribe, do the same thing, but change 'subscribe'
to
'unsubscribe'.

thanks,

ABSOLUT

What exactly did they pave the way for?  As far as Abeastie converstion -
I for one hate "Fight for your right to party"  Its just damn annoying to
me.

Otherwise i do actually like them. 
Although I'm more interested in seeing Freaky Flow @ Getto BB.
And it'll prob cost $30 + just because of them, which sucks.

first off-

vw 98 bug...little fluffy clouds...wicked tv ad

vw made a mistake not getting joe187 to do one of the soundtracks...


i also heard another techno-ey track for another bug ad...


also..mercedes, bmw, and mazda (miata) all dope ass soundtracks...

hold on theres a drum n bas ad and yes its for the fucking vw bug too its a
chill bukem esque ad GOD DAMN target maketing plurry ravers=90's hippies
yuck.

then pepsi followed that ad immediately with the village ppl ripoff
P-E-P-S-I....hahah they suck :)


back to the big carmaker...i personally like the fact that im hearing
creative use of energetic music to stimulate our buying impulses :)

also, nike f.i.t. ads feature a friend of mine...the one ad with renaldo
(brasilian soccer player) had its soundtrack done by a kid who goes to
oberlin...

so im waiting to hear what electronics company (SONY?) joe is doing a
soundtrack for...goddamn thats gonna be cool (almost as cool as the first
time i heard one of his track on 91.7 - i was like 'yo! i know that
kid...we live in the same house!' :) haha hearing the track on the radio
was a hell of a lot different than hearing the same beats coming out of the
basement :) (respect joe :)

big up all cru's inside...scj tomorrow nite, cheer saturday...see ya there
:)

peace,
hossam

ps- todd, i just got off the phone with dj hype, he'll be at the ghetto
booty battle spinning right after carl cox. really ;)

I just recently got into the beasties, and I first heard this track late at
night, and I thought he said "and I thought to myself... what's she talking
about???"... I thought it was a joke :)

actually, the kid who saw the contract told me that rachel said it
would probably only be about $20 or $25 because so many people were
expected to show up.

Oh my gosh!!!  The first time I saw that movie I had to have been seven
years old.  I was on a brownie sleepover and the scout leaders had rented
a vcr, the old version of Frankenstein (black&white), and BREAKIN 2!!!
Frankenstein scared the bajeezes out of me but I was mesmerized by the
colors and music and costumes and backgrounds and dancing on the
ceiling!!!!!!!  WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11

That guy with the crutches! Woweekazowee!!!!

  Thats not quite true, Ice-T may have become bigger from his appearance in the
Breakin' movies, but I'm pretty sure he was selling some records before the
movie. He was one of the most prolific West Coast producers back then, and
probably won a spot in that movie... Ahhh nostalgia. I was listening to him along
with Run D.M.C., Grandmaster Flash and Mantronix.

What is funny (or maybe not funny) is how Ice-T's rap was much cleaner &
wholesome back then!

some quotes from his stuff...
1984/5 (Breakin' 2) : "I believe in the beat.! ... Foreva'" (the climax song)
                                 & "he's reckless" (on his d.j. Glove)

to 1986/7 (album): G.L.G.B.K.A.F. -"Girls Let's Get Butt Naked And F*ck!" & "i'm
your pusher..."

If this gbb is this promoter's first shing-ding then starting a rumor
about the boyz being there sure is a good way to draw people in.Lots of
people will go for the mere possibility of seeing the boyz. Thus the
promoter(s) can expect a lot of people and have high ticket prices to make
lots of money on there first party. Even if the boyz aren't there, people
will be sure to enjoy what music that is played and have a good time. By
not putting them on a flyer then it is never official that they were
scheduled and the promoter(s) can't be blamed for them not showing up. 
It's the perfect setup.  It doesn't go along with the whole respect thang
and does seem a bit too much effort just to make some money but still
possible. Whatcha think?

Heh, in 1983 or 84 when that song came out, (I was like 17 or 18) ALOT(Most?
almost All?) of white kids (myself included) only listened to crappy hard
rock like Def leppard , and even good rock like Rush / Zeppelin etc... There
was alot of peer pressure in the mid 80s, what after the DISCO fiasco and
all that... anyone who admitted to having an old copy of the Saturday Night
Fever double LP soundtrack in thier closet (which I do :P) was primed for
being shot :). It was especially uncool for white kids to listen to RAP
where I lived (Colorado Springs, CO.), so I didnt really have any exposure
to much else, neither did any of my friends... it was like a
self-perpetuating thing. But the Beasties kinda changed all that... For me,
my first exposure to them (on MTV) kinda opened my eyes that there was more
to music than loud ass guitar solos etc... I'm sure I wasnt the only one
affected by them that way... I'm not saying it was them alone that started a
new era, it might have been MTV, or ? but they were definatly a part of it
for me at least... So I have to agree that in some sense they paved the
way...

And Hossam and I put ragga drum 'n bass in our Ting ad that we wrote
tonignt!

Seriously though, the "drum and bass" that you heard in the VW beetle ad
is called "Parsec" by Stereolab, from the new album 'Dots and Loops'.
Last week, before they unveiled the ads on national television I got to
see the entire Beetle television campaign in my Television production
class.  (A speaker from Arnold Advertising in Boston was there)...  when I
heard Stereolab I was floored.  And then they rolled out Little Puffy
Clouds (that's rikki lee jones talking--- i learned that).. and
Spiritualized, and that other ravy track is by Fluke.

I say big up to them... even if the car looks like a bubble and has a
stupid ass flower vase on the dashboard (no lie) it's a dope campaign.

Yes...*sniff*

I used to work at Cloud 9 the summer of 95, and I think it got shut down
by the end of the year.  Lisa Kail (who started Turbo-Zen back with Buda
back in 92) opened Cloud 9 with her sister Eva and another friend.  Her
friend ended up backing out by the end of the summer, leaving all of the
finances and everything in the hands of Eva and Lisa...

anyhow, as an advertising major, I really attribute Cloud 9's closing to
severe lack of adversising.  I tried to help her out all I could at the
time, but she never wanted to run ads in anything buy the city paper.  And
flyers were often few and far between.  It's a shame, too, because not
only was it an alternative to Metropol and the other, but it was ran like
a family.  For years, Lisa was like my second mother.. except this mom
gave me shots and smoked me up on occasion... :)  Everyone that worked
there was really chill and good natured.. even Ed, the hardcore bouncer
with the dope three wheeled bike if you got to know him.

I spent one of the best summers of my life working at Cloud 9... it's just
sad that corporate clubs like metroopl have to suck up all the
spotlight. Lisa was even threatened to move one of her nights around by
Metropol because the format was too like theirs... :/  

anyhow

I hope she's going okay-- i haven't talked to her in about a year and I'm
always wondering how she's doing.  If anyone knows how to reach her I'd be
really interested...

aww blessed cloud 9...

So I guess it was a financial reason for closing? that's really wierd... it
always seemed packed in there... but then again I only went on weekends.

Yeah the only way I found out about it was when I parked cross the street
when I was going to Metropol, and heard the funky beats coming out of the
place and decided to go in and check it out...

Heh, yeah even the cop who worked the door was cool, he let me park my vette
across the street in front of the fire-hydrant, told me if any cops tried to
ticket it, he'd stop em :)

Yeah, I figgured Metropol wouldnt be happy about it... the music and
atmosphere at cloud-9 (not to mention the male-female ratio) kicked ass all
over Metropol...

I was going there like everyweekend... then I hadda quit for a few months
cause of this serious relationship I got into, after I got that out of the
way, I went to go back and the lights were off... I was bumming...

I started thinking about that place when the big Kay discussion was going
on, cause that's where I first saw here... she was there all the time pretty
much... but then again so was I... I'm prolly sure I'd know you if I saw
you.

Personally i think the new bug is ugly.  And the fact that they made it
priced like a standard 98car is almost blasphemous, though I wanst old
enough to care when they sold the original ones from what my parents tell
me half the point of the original bug was that it was cheap as shit and
'adorable'.  Just feels like they are trying to cash in on all the grown
up hippies with jobs.  The flower holder is kindof funny though, friend of
mine says it looks like it might be the right size for a small bong.

Then we have:

"What goes down stairs, alone or in pairs and even goes offroad? Amigo,
amigo oh what fun and joy. Amigo amigo, its fun for a girl and boy."
Im curios for my own sake who DOESNT know what the tune is from? I wanna
guage how old im getting. :)

And who has seen the unionbay comercial with the raverkid dancing on the
front porch?

Me and my roommate were discussion this:
What makes one commercial that is selling based on a piece of society good
and anotherone bad? 

Specifically we both thought the Amigo commercial had
style and class. Whereas the unionbay one and another one we saw that we
cant remember pissed us off.  (We called it a hattrick cuz we had three
comercials in a row capitalizing off of societies memories and stealing
the public's ideas).

My explanation was the amigo comercial captured the spirit of the thing
that it was using. Didnt just steal the jingle but made the entire
comercial reminscent of the original comercial it was based off of.
Whereas the unionbay one just has the raver kid 'stuck in there' kind of
like, "raver kids buy unionbay and so should you".  

Ideas? Opinions? Ive already put on my flameretardent underwear this time.
Let The Rave Begin

Heh, whats funny of course is the fact that they are partially, maybe not
consciosly, capitalizing on the drug use of today.  Specifically, if your
a heavy user of acid or e and you listen to techno/rave/whatever a lot
then there is going to be some bonding in your mind between feeling good
and techno music. Then when you hear the techno music on the add (or see
the visuals of the rebok comercial :) you are going to trigger a synaptic
memory of those emotions.  (This is sometimes called a flashback by some
people though flashbacks are usually considerd stronger and invovle actual
images or prolonged states of feeling like your under the influence
again).

My first notice of this was the frutopia comercial. I saw it while
tripping once and later when i was sober saw it and imediatly had a flash
(thats what i call the less then flashback level of flashbacks).
Subsequently i started researching lsd in the libraries and its been shown
to be correct to an extent.  halucinagenic drugs create memories just like
life creates them. So your mind cant distinguish the being high versus not
being high part of a trip. So if you remember something that happened
while you were high, you remember it like you were high and remember the
emotion as well as the visual and mental imagery.

Actually, I heard a more realistic variation of this in Philly for whatever

the airport hangar rumour came from?? I also heard that Sony was going to

:)  i'll be the first to admit that buffalo's hasn't got anything...there
are some true people that try but everyone just can't come together it
seems in my limited view of this town.  about the ONLY thing i do here is 
work at school...i've been here 3 semesters, i'm leaving in
may and i certainly don't stick around here on weekends. just fyi i've
been an active part in the nyc scene for years and that's my home base.

sorry to any of you that i have offended. i wasn't dissing your scene as
much as the apparent lack of professionalism with this party...now, i'm
the first one to just lay back and let events just happen...i'm not even
into large parties like this (call me a sell-out for the day if you will)
but with an act of this type...you guys have got to realize that there
are people outside of pittsburgh interested too....i started out just
peacefully trying to figure out what or if something was happening with
tickets and then i find out that noone really can access any real
information not you, not the dj's, not the promoters from toronto or nyc
that i know...noone!!  the bboys have said in the past that they did NOT
want to do a party....you can't blaim me for being suspicious of unknown
promoters in pittsburgh claiming that they've changed their mind and then
finding various rumors exploding out all of the place.

again, i'm sorry for taking out my frustrations on you. believe me, i know
how hard it is in a small growing scene like yours. all of you got to
admit (whether you like or dislike the fact that bb's are playing) that
your scene is getting some real attention from this.  for your sake i hope
it doesn't flop in your face...

ok, this is getting to be ridiculous.
I've got some issues with this thing, namely, why someone would do such
a huge event as their first party. 
anyone who's been around the rave scene long will know that it's *very*
easy to lose a lot of money on a rave (friends of mine in seattle lost a
grand when they brought in derrick carter)
anyway, that's my appeal to common sense.
if this does go off in some form, I'll be pretty happy though
(yeah, dj funk!!!)

Notice Ice-T's rap in that movie - its all about big'up'in the dj's skills
rather than his own. :) I wish our events today were like the party in
that flick.

hehe it would have been difficult to see me, unless you looked up into the
booth-- i ran the lights for the most part, and helped out at the bar at
opening and closing.

yeah, cloud 9 was the shit.. goth on mondays, larry the funkster (from
stedaford's) on wednesdays with the biggest collection of disco and funk
I've ever seen, kevin on thursdays, sine and eric justin on saturdays, all
ages sundays-- man..

not only that, I got to meet Martin Atkins from PiL and Murder, Inc. whenhe did
spoken word on the Invisible Records Route 666 tour... and Chip from
EyeGasm let me play with RoboScans that night :)

man that was the shit

I went there a bunch of times.  It was an ok venue, but it had an awesome
mix of events. Then one day I was going to some show
there and the door had a big ol' sticker on it.  The owners got kicked out
for not paying rent for X amount of months.  And that was it.

Sucks doesn't it?  This seems to happen again and again.  In just my
experience: The Strip bar, Cloud 9, 168, Lucianos all had a go of it,
coming and going in about a year or so each. Stuff has to keep getting
re-invented every 6 months or so.  This is good and bad i guess, but
mostly bad.  Laga shows promise of sticking around, but so did all those
other places.  Sadly Chameleon doesn't seem like it's even gotten a chance
yet.

No, I'm talking about Lisa Kail (that's her last name), not DJ Kali, who's
name also happened to be Lisa, and spun goth and industrial at cloud nine.

Lisa Kail was the owner-- and she and Joel started T-Z... that's who I'm
wondering about..

i can't really comment on this controversy unless i know something more 
for sure about it, except i will say i have talked to rachel about it. she
is the one in charge of it, she's from pittsburgh, and she says the
funding is coming from kids in pittsburgh whose parents are millionaires
or something and give them lots of money and they're fronting it to her.
so she has told me all this directly but that's all i know.

which one was that? as far as i know there have been only 4 parties (as
in somebody actually organized them, booked DJs, got a space for it.
there's been a whole bunch of things around here notoriously thrown
together at the last minute) in kent before:

1. (i don't know the name), date: feb 96 i think, nobody really big was
booked for it.

2. starbirth, 23 mar 96, this was the lineup: Earth, Gank, Dannyboy,
Freeze, Anthone. nobody huge there either.

3. untitled party by badass productions (that is the dumbest promotion
company name i have ever heard, marginally even stupider than "kind nug
productions) nov or dec 97, titonton (yay) was the headliner.

4. we can't be stopped (also from badass prod.), that was in january,
danny da wildchild was headlining.

there have also been some kent state events, with dj spooky and scanner,
and coolio (haha) and the pharcyde, and a few much smaller hip-hop shows.
but if what you're talking about was in akron, i have no idea what it was
since i can't begin to keep track of everything that's happened there too.

i use pine every day. what other way is there, besides elm which is at
the same technology level? i also use that same telnet program, or the mac
equivalent if i'm on a mac, every day too. well, i sure hope none of my
posts have typos and misspellings (except capitalizing is a pain in the
ass so i don't bother like a lot of people). that would make me look
uneducated and sloppy. =/

In case you don't know... this sat:

Mar 28 CHEER 412.734.8427 
 Newest Event from House of Styles. Audio-Mental Cleanzing for your
pleasure. LineUP: Green Velvet (Relief Recs, Chi), Gavin Hardkiss
(Hardkiss Music, SF), Dave Trance (Psychoactive, NY), Stryke (Adrenalin,
Miami), Sine (SCJ, pgh), and The Instigator (Hypervinyl, pgh). 
Sadly the new location fell through (through no fault of HOS), but this
will still be a wicked event.

Also Tonight @ Steel City Jungle
  Sine & Saint in the battle of the old school jungle choons.  NOT one to
miss.  Also Kira with her debut (i think?).

i didn't really like midnight marauders anyway. an even better old school
feel would be like people's instinctive travels and the paths of rhythm. i
remember listening to that back in high school (like in 91) with the
church youth group + we had a dance party when that and deee-lite were the
coolest things and everybody danced to that. =} it's so funny. and my
soccer team had a tape we played when we warmed up for a game + i had
whoever made it put "can i kick it?" on the tape. =D

look, lyrics:

Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug

=D

here's another rumor hot off the press...

"the getto booty battle will be held in hell.  the beastie boys won't be
there.  instead all the dead presidents (James Monroe, Zachary Taylor,
Thomas Jefferson) of the united states will instead be performing as a new
miami bass outfit 'Ho-Nasty'."

its just a rumor though. :)

 If they were promised, yes I would agree with the disastrous results. I'm
arguing that they really haven't been promised by any official means
except word of mouth and how official is that? All the people linked to
this thing seem to say something different. Look at all the rumors about
where it's going to be. Based on that alone how can you trust what the say
about who will be there? These people need to get their shit together and
create a flyer. 
Just by a ticket and if they are there then you get to see a rockn' show.
If they arent' there, keep in mind (before you email this list) that it
was only a rumor that they would show up.

I think it would be interesting if someone was able to take ALL of the
rumors flying around town about GBB and make a little chart, something
like a family tree.  When we finally learn the true story and the root of
all this confusion, we could pin it down next to our little visual aid.
Then we could write a paper on the believablity (is that a word?) of "word
of mouth". Then we could submit it to a psychology publication.  Then we
could get lots of money.  Then we could throw a really peachy pb-cle
party.  Who volunteers?

Hold on now, 

I never said anything about the actual rumor spreaders...unless of course,
they were the actual compilers of information!

Calling the lines is very simple.  You will get a machine and you will
(usually, not always) get some really enthusiastic person telling you how great
the party is going to be and who's going to be there.  Then you get various
directions, depending on where you're coming from: ("If you're coming from
Columbus, take 71 N; From Pitts, take 80 West; etc.). 

Sometimes, however, the person on the recording talks way too fast and you have
to call a couple times to get all the information.  This doesn't happen often,
though.

Also, and this doesn't happen often either, but sometimes the directions are
just plain awful and you get lost.  Advice: Always take the flyer/info line #
with you when you leave.  If the recording names a specific place at which you 
are eventually supposed to end up, it may also help to get directions off the
internet (Yahoo has a good 'Get Directions' site) -- this will tell you how
long the drive will take.

I found it rather amusing myself. But then again, I find your lack of

I hate to respond to all, but..

First of all Eric I don't feel that way about you...

However I do feel that talking shit about people on the list to the list is
the reason why the list is at an all time low..Can't this be done in person?
That's kind of the reason why I have responded to all...I mean there are times
when we get ALOT of mail..like this week because of GBB rumors and to have all
this other added crap  is quite disturbing....

I've been reading the archives of this list for some time now, and 
certain people just _need_ to be flamed periodically.

ok, i'm sorry to have to get all pissy about this, but i can't help it.  

the preflyer for Ghetto Booty Battle promises a lot.  and unfortunately, 
when someone promises that much, there comes quite a bit of skepticism.  
when individual research shows that there are inconsistencies, the 
skepticism increases.

i really want this "thing" to happen, but i'm skeptical about it 
actually going down.  we all should be.  

something this big is just begging for rumors, and the rumors abound.  
naturally.  but shit, this is getting ridiculous.  i'm sorry, but it is.  
hourly, daily, weekly rumors, all variations on ones that we've all 
already heard.  some of them may be true, i hope some of them are true, 
but for now, not many of us know for sure.  

i'm just hanging out, biding my time, waiting for more _solid_ 
confirmation that something real is actually going to happen.  not 
paying attention to the rumors.  i don't care.  it's over a month away, 
and we're not going to get any closer to solving the mystery of if this 
thing is real by making one hell of a rumor mill.

there. done.

Umm, I have gotten two different ones so far. They're both just little 
paper ones(no high-gloss finish), but they both prominently say 'Beastie 
Boys' along with about 30 other dj's. If I had my scanner working, I 
would send a copy. The infoline number is 412-687-6605.

Herm I got one last SCJ... it was in color but looked like it was printed on
a cheap inkjet then color-copied... no where did is say "Beastie Boys".. it
did say "B Boys" mixed in with the DJs... Kinda makes me skeptikal... it
does say in big ass letters on the web page "Beastie Boys"... bleah I'm all
for giving the promoter the benefit of the doubt, but there's no way I'm
pre-purchasing tickets on this one... Heck if the beasties dont show, and
1/2 of the people listed on the flyer do show, and it's only $20, I think it
would be still worth it, and I'm still going :)

That said... I just don't really expect them to show tho... I mean lets sit
and think about it... they've publically said they dont like to do parties,
(or was it that they DONT do parties)... They would cost ALOT of cash if
they DID do parties... Alot of people speculate about them going behind the
record companies back, there would have to be something extra in it for them
if they did... They prolly only would do it if they were real friendly with
the promoter... almost as a favor... This promoter has never done a party
before, I doubt if thier like best friends with the Beasie boys... herm...
it adds up to like someone else said 420 million to 1 that they dont show...
I would almost go so far as to wager some serious cash on it...

Okay, you can all bash my head in with various objects if this has already
been talked about or mentioned or anything like that.

What's going on with 420? Caught something about it on WCSB tonight, but
my car's radio decided to lose the signal half way through, and not find
it again. I got "April 18th and 19th." Anybody got an info line or
something? Thanks.

Taiwanese Sect: God Will Be on TV

GARLAND, Texas (AP) - The Taiwanese religious group God's Salvation Church is
awaiting an appearance from God on television, which their leader has said
will happen just after midnight. Chen Heng-ming has said God will appear on
Channel 18 across the country at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday to mark the beginning of
his return to Earth. Implied in the media and police attention to the sect is
the notion that church members might take drastic action if God does not
appear. Chen and his followers insist they have no plans to harm themselves.

i'll usually go to anything that has anyone from deee-lite there.  the
"park rave madness" parties in brooklyn were pure dope, with ani and
dmitry ... and i saw lady kier at candyland a few times.  candyland is
now-defunct and i'm pretty sure park rave madness would be too ...

the best set i've ever heard was from ani, in a roller-skating rink near
pittsburgh on a hazy summer night ... he's got really quick hands.  i
remember his selections included "bonita applebum" from tribe called quest
and "sexual healing" from marvin gaye - the original recording.  that set
was so luscious i almost came right on the dance floor. 


i'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony

In a message dated 98-03-25 13:06:25 EST, you write:

<< Since it was broadcast on National Public Radio, BBC World Service
 Radio, CNN, CNBC, and probably half a dozen other national and
 international news agencies... I don't think I'm missing anything.
 
 And just what exactly does this have to do with pb-cle-raves? >>

Well........just read the subject my friend and you'll find out what it has to
do with pb-cle raves:)      (just trying to break some of the GBB tension:)

Hey everyone,

	You may be tired of hearing me bitch and moan about school,
singing, etc.  Here's a chance for you to hear what I'm bitching and
moaning about!  I'm having a recital on March 28th at 4:00 at Trombino's
Piano Gallerie at 944 Penn Ave. in Pittsburgh, a couple of blocks from the
Strip.  It will be approximately 90 minutes long.  I will be singing
selections by Caldara, Handel, Faure, and Copland, among others.  My
accompanist and partner, Andrea Baiocchi, will be playing works by Mozart
and Rachmaninov.  It's also FREE.

Recital:

March 28th, 1998
4:00

Trombino Piano Gallerie
944 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh
 
There is no info line here folks, but drop me a line and I'll answer any
dignified questions you may have!

Hey all, i need some help on a problem i have. It involves a certain record
I bought. Okay, i don't know if anyone has the same record 
DJ T-1000 "Downshifter EP" but on the track "Disconnected" there's this wacked out 
grating sound (it sounds like when you drag the needle across the grooves)
that starts up 30 sec into the track and it has no rhythm to it what-so-ever and
basically ruins the track so i'm assuming it's a mishap of the pressing. The 
same thing happens on the track "deep curve (laetltla casta mix)" but not nearly as 
bad as on the other track. Both tracks happen to be the last tracks on each side 
too, which makes me believe it's a mishap of the pressing also (unless T-1000 was
on some wacky shit when he produced it, which i doubt). Does anybody else 
who have this record have the same problem????? What should i do bout this, i mean
i bought the record in DC at Music-now, what do i do???? looking for any kind of
input that would help me out!!
Thanx a bunch
peace, love, unity, respects

I'm pretty sure it's part of the record. I remember people talking about
it on another list, G-Tech, which I'm forwarding your letter to. So
someone is sure to confirm to you. Maybe even DJ T-1000 will respond
personally.

If you go to the mw raves schedule, you'll find it.  I just saw it.  I
don't remember the exact address, so if you first go to the hyperreal
page, I'm sure you can get there!  Good Luck!  Have fun!

I have no idea why Joel didn't tell me about this when I saw him in
Boulder over spring break, but he has a weekly netcast show for three
hours on Saturdays (live mixes) on Radio Valve on the internet...

it's called DataStream Radio, and is located on www.radiovalve.net.  Tune
in Saturdays at 4:00 AM, 12pm and 8pm for the show... I'm going to try it
this weekend.

All you need is Real Audio 5 and a connection around 28.8...

ok steve.  here it is.   i've unsubbed him several times for several
things, including bouncing email.  as you said in a previous email he will
just change his screen name and resub.   really short of TOTALLY CLOSING
THE LIST so i HAVE TO APPROVE EVERY SUBSCRIPTION there isnt much i've been
able to figure out.  i really dont want to be the list-nazi here, but
personally i'm getting fed up with it.  if anyone has any objections or
other solutions, i'm MORE THAN HAPPY TO LISTEN TO THEM.

I don't know about Sony , but I do know that there are some abandoned
missle sites around pgh fromt he days of the cold war.  I think because
of some sort of clause, they had to give them to the native americans of
the area and they hold some sort of native american festival there every
year . . . so maybe that's where its going to be?  That would be sweet. 
Expecially if we could get some native americans in full indian garb to
do their dancing (I doubt it will happen, but it would be cool)

ABSOLUT

PS-I will try to find more info on this.

Wed Apr 08                   LOWEST OF THE LOW                   Pittsburgh

[sounds interesting, but somewhat off-topic???]

Invisible Reoords is pleased to announce the "Lowest of the Low" 1998
North American tour
featuring 5 main bands complimented by special guests at various points
in the tour.

"Not Breathing" will open the evening with its blend of hard techno and
experimental noise.

"Bagman" is the side project of Lee "Bastard" Fraser of Sheep on Drugs.
Lee remains one of the most prominent artists working in the field of
jungle and electronic music.

"F.M. Einheit" of Einsturzende Neubauten will make a rare North America
appearance with his 4 piece band.  Industrial madness.

"Scorn" - Dub terrorist Mick Harris' group Scorn has recieved critical
support and has established a wide audience for his pioneering ambient
dub.

"Pigface"  - if your familiar with the old; this is ALOT different,
ambient and danceable with some of the old thrown in too.  In addition
to the usual suspects including Martin Atkins, Charles Levi (My Life
with the TKK), Bob Dog, Curse Mackey (Evil Mothers) and Meg Lee Chin,
three other performers have been confirmed:  Gus Ferguson (Test Dept and
Dead Can Dance), Vas Kallas (Hanzel und Gretyl) and Jared Hendrickson
(Chemlab).  Additional contributors TBA.

    The evening will be seamless...with respect to your time, money,
ears and eyes; this event will be coming to you complete with an ultra
low end sound system and state of the art visual manipulations (Genesis
P. Orridge) to stimulate and already overstimulated audience. This is
not to be missed.

Wednesday April 8th, 1998  Metropol
advance tickets $12.50

EVer wonder what its like to have part of your soul taken away?  Just to have
someone come in and violate your privacy, and on top of all that take away one
of the things u really love in life...all for a couple of bucks?  I mean think
about it...think about the one thing that you have the most fun doing...that u
could just lose yourself in for hours and hours and hours...and think about
what it would be like if some punk ass mutha@!!@$#%^#@% came and took it away
right from under your nose!!!!!!
Now u can maybe understand how i am feeling at this very moment... 
Tonight, someone broke into my car and stole my leather record case which
contained a good majority of my records.(not to mention my headphones).  I
never knew what it felt like to have something, some part of you ripped away
like that.  I'm not just talkin about some standered run of the mill records,
i mean these were hand picked, gems... some of which are irreplacible.  It
would be different if they broke into my car and stole my stereo, or cd's or
tapes...i could live with that. But records!!!!!!!!  This is how i express
myself, how i get my point across to groups of people!!!  And now I have to
start over...re-spend the money to try and replace some of the trax that i had
already spent hard earned money on!!! it's like one big kick in the ass!  it's
like someone coming up and saying "I am going to take away one of the things u
love most in life because i can! and there is nothing you can do about it
!!!"  
The worst part is it happened about an hour before i was supposed to play at
Maxwells! I mean people always say things happen for a reason... I really hope
so this time!!!
Oh well...I am off to ponder my losses and to see what all I can get back...

Just wanted to babble,

Hey all, thanks to the guys who sent me info about Cincinatti,
I'm sorry I didn't get in touch with you while I was there (I guess
U of C is on Spring Break now..).  I managed to stop at Kowtow which
is a pretty decent clothing store, the owner was super nice and she
helped me with directions to Clubhead.  The drive down to Clubhead is 
through a pretty quality ghetto :) and is in a cool part of downtown.
The owner (DJ Bob-A-Dob?) was just the greatest, told me about some
house dj's at a club I will probably check out tonight...  _good_
selection of hardstep/dark/jungle...actually a good selection all around.
Too bad I will miss Innocent but I wanted to be back in da Burgh in 
time for Cheer :)  c'est la vie....

> 
> <progress report - APRIL 18, Toronto:>
>   as our flyer indicates, we've added bailey [metalheadz, uk]
>   to "progress." recently hailed by URB magazine as a "must see
>   in 98," and highly praised by the likes of roni size and doc scott.
>   bailey has been resident at the metalheadz nights at bluenote and 
>   hanover grand club and one of london's most liked djs. bailey will
>   set you free with his dark and experimental d'n'b. 
> 
>   we've also added pittsburgh's duo with dj sine and mc sphinx. 
>   both are residents at steel city jungle and will compliment nicely
  our already solid d'n'b lineup consisting of toronto's best.

>   we got word from adam beyer that the three swedes may want
>   to "mix things up a bit" for "progress" by adding another
>   turntable and doing a 6hr tag team for us. the order of the
>   night will be: cari lekebusch around 1am followed by
>   adam beyer, then neuromancer. details on the tag team will
>   be in the next newsletter. neuromancer, a 1990 world DMC
>   finalist, has requested from us to the let him break it down with 
  some old skewl (circa 89-91) electro supported by his 
  impeccable scratching skills. we are more than happy to 
  fulfill his wish.
> </progress report:>
> 
> <report: forward MAY 30, Toronto>
>   we're bringing in another rising star in the global d'n'b 
>   scene with fierce [no u-turn, prototype, uk].  this is the 
>   first canadian appearance by the hardcore teenager
>   considered to be doc scott's favourite dj. he produced
>   crystal and co-produced proton with nico on the torque
>   album. fierce's funky, dark d'n'b productions are truly 
>   bringing d'n'b to the next level.
> 
>   in addition to what's on the flyer, on his request, we've 
  also added america's #1 d'n'b dj: dieselboy [611, philadelphia]. 
>   damian is not to be missed as his mixing skills are as smooth 
  as butter while his tracks are always on the bleeding edge of 
  d'n'b. he has already made a name for himself in toronto, and 
  this performance will definitely take him 'over the edge' there. 

>   the order of the night in the techno room will likely be:
>   mike dearborn, joey beltram, steve stoll [live], then dj
>   skull.
> 
>   a new flyer for "forward" will be distributed starting
>   april 18th @ "progress." 
> </report: forward>
> 
> <extras:>

Just wondering if anyone else who went to 'all good' last weekend got 
the 'forgetting pills'? Yeah, funny joke to play on someone looking for 
fun stuff. I guess that's a chance you have to take though.

BTW, don't you love this type of message from some sad little person?

Comeon man! Lord_Nikon was the best! I wanna fotographic memory! Though I
do laugh at what aol'ers consider 3133t3.  Woohoo, lets forge each other's
emails.

Speaking of Hackers, the club scene on their way to meet the two media
icons (forget their names) rocked ass. Now *thats* what a party should be,.


 Though I did find it funny that they didnt put the proper red-tones into
the movie, I wonder how many kiddies out there tried to tape their vcr and
play it hehe.

Yeah, its been two days, but that's what it takes to recover after you get
yer booty gyrated like i did @ steel city on Tues.

Much Much Much respect to Saint & Sine for a fab set of 'oldskool' rockers
and nonstop beats!  Bobble was also quite excellent dropping a varierty of
new tunes.

I don't have the flyer with me, but if i remember correctly, the lineup
for the next two SCJ's is good stuff.  

Nexttime is the DC special with John Tab and Mike B + Sine.
The time after that is one for the smokers and bouncers with Lion (yes!
ragga-styleee from NYC) and Kevin Cunningham + Sine.

Also I heard that Fri's @ laga will be starting up pretty soon, in
association with 5-Star, giving you a variety of djs playing house,
breaks, drum & bass, etc...

Sounds like there's going to be many many club nights if they all survive.

l8s,
 cutup

Have you tried complaining to his ISP? Even aol from time to time will take
an initiative on abusive users. Especially: verbal abuse,
breakins/forgeries and spam.  Best bet is to coalite up as many of the
offensive emails and forward them with a request of action to abuse@aol.com
usually you get a reply in three to five business days.  Otherwise the best
bet is a proactive reverse attack. Ive gota stack of anon-remailers here if
anybody wants em. :)

I just cranked out a little web page intended for the YahooMaps of raves
past and present.

http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~dscw/RaveSpots.html

YahooMaps just kicks ass.  The links jump you directly to the marked maps
or the driving directions.
Specifically the directions to Cheer (Irish Center) are on here.  I plan on
putting future raves up as well so soon as a space is confirmed by me (or
if someone wants to pass it to me) I can put it up too.  Though the time
the info line gives directions isnt always enough for me to update the web.

For now the driving directions are based from CMU since thats a fairly
obvios point to the pittsburghers I know. And I know a few caravans that
sometimes start there. Also if someone wants to give me the usual places
that non pittsburghers enter pittsburgh from I can add directions from
those locations. 

If any promoters want to mail me their location apriori I can put them up
at or after a specified time if they still want to hold to the tradition of
late information. But I figure anything I figure out on my own is fairgame.
 If you want to gaurentee your spot gets maped I need a good halfhour of
free time per new spot because Yahoo isnt always cooperateive, especially
for places that are on the outskirts of town.

I normally dont get a chance to travel to any cleveland ones but if someone
wants to do a page for them ill put a link up no prob. I can almost
gaurentee that anything that I go to and get the location for a day in
advance will be up and most likely anything ive been to.

about how some one had broken into his car & stole his & melloman's
rekkids...we were in there but like 15 mins. cuz i wuz s'posed to just
pick up a tape from Doug and then we were supposed to go to this
private slumber party...we get to my car & my passenger side window
wuz gone as well as Leidra's $200 gucci bag that contained all her

part wuz they left my Pioneer car stereo and speakers untouched...
they didn't even go for the most valuable thing in dat car...the color
copy of the autographed & signed polaroid of shannon & leidra posing
w/ da OG porn*star, Ron Jeremy (the latest addition to the porn cru

man, i thought thieveland216 wuz bad!!!...614 columbus crooks in mad

roommates car got broken into, then her car got broken into, then 
shannon's car got broken into, then jason's car got broken into, 
and now mine!!!...(but it mebbe cuz i just know too many 614 ravahs!)...

...reminds me of when joe 187 had his whole car stolen!!...or the road 
trip i did with walt (Collective) to dat Ultraworld party in baltimore...
we walk out and every car along the side of the road by the warehouse 
had gotten broken into except our rental van!...i guess we were just lucky 
dat night...as well as the night i left my trunk open at the first Family 
Affair party in Akron (but dat may have been cuz kids knew i helped 
promo dat party)...i guess my luck finally ran out!...

i guess the point of dis is dat we are ravers NOT thieves!!...we are a
Family dat should look out for one another (aka "good lookin out"!)
...NOT gank all your goods as soon as your back is turned...it goes
with the PLUR concept...we should feel comfortable partying with
one another...and not have paranoid thoughts about havin all your
stuff stolen if you lay down yur jacket or back pack at a party...
hellz dats how i met jamie troutsoup, who runs this list now...he
and greta found my bag after an Ele Mental party and returned it to
me!!!...now dats what you call "good lookin out"!...i wuz so happy, i 
made jamie a 'PLUR' T-shirt!...

...dats kinda why this list is maintained...we kinda look out for one
anutha by providing the latest info on all the partys...and if we 
think such & such party is gonna be bunk, we spill da beans...and
after going to enuff partys, we start meetin one anutha, we start
e-mailing one anutha, it gets to be like a family after awhile...

so the last thing anyone of us should have to worry about is having
something stolen from them at a party or their car broken into or
their internet account broken into...

PLUR, it's what makes it work...

If these things are so important (irreplacable records) or so
valuable (expensive designer handbags full of credit cards), why are
they being left in unattended vehicles?  It's an increasingly
violent, rudderless society we live in.

Hey man, sorry about the Columbus area. Things like cars being broken into
makes me embarrased to say I'm from there. One rule of thumb I always
maintained was that I would never go to High St as long as osu was still
in session. That is where all the crime comes from (no offense to you osu
people but over the summer, high st is so much better in terms of traffic,
pedestrian and vehicular, and crime) I must admit though, the used record
stores don't have much when the students are gone. that is a bummer
sometimes. 

Whatever you do, take care of your shoes

Jay

i'm sorry, but this was amazingly rude.  yes, all the things that were 
stolen were material, and everyone says that we shouldn't place value in 
material things, but we do, especially if they are an emotional 
extension of ourselves.  we get attached to our things, we love our 
things, and that's just the way it is.  so when some "person" invades 
our lives by stealing something that means something to us, it's going 
to fucking hurt.  end of story.

uhh, actually no.

first off i can say i speak with authority on this subject coz over the past
few years *i* have been subject to theft of personal belongings totalling
nearly $1500 at/around parties...so i KNOW what jason feels/felt.

i think what craig was saying is just plain old COMMON SENSE. watch your
back. this isnt utopia. you're a fool if you think it is.

i think everyone is debating different point here. i'd love to hear a debate
where someone claimed that society in general was NOT becoming more violent
and less "plurry"

ultimately, *i* am to blame for th theft of my belongings, i was never
mugged, i was an idiot and didnt guard my valuables.

i think erika responded to craig's frankness as if it implied a lack of
sympathy. (not that craig is required to be sympatetic towards anyone,
including strangers)

while i feel bad for what happened to these people, shit happens. and u
start talking about leaving gucci bags and shit lying in plain view and the
situation takes on a different light.
 
seems like we have one person advising responsibility and precaution
(which i agree with), and another person preaching universal sympathy and
compassion.


keep your apples and oranges straight. :)

peace,
hossam

What do people on the list think of the Irish Centre location? 
Personally I love it, but I talked to soemone today who doesn't like it
with a passion.  She thinks that all the events have a bad vibe?!  Now,
I've always thought the opposite about the Irish Centre?  It kind of
packs you in so that you are really in the mix and seeing all sorts of
crazy stuff.  What's the general opinion on it, cause I may be biased
because I live about a 10 minute walk from there?

I'm not sure, but we might want to find a better spot.  I mean, that is a
big enough space, but the problem is is that at many events they let you
in at those doors,  or there are just a WHOLE bunch of people standing
around and general other chaos that would make a net-meet a little more
dificult.  and the real problem is that there isn't anywhere that is
always good.  Places in general that I think CoulD be good places are the
back room where the coat hangers are, actually in the bathroom (most of
the time there are girls in the guy bathroom anyways (just kidding)), 
outside in the main dancefloor area, by the vendors (whereever they are,
we will be), or on the dancefloor.  Who knows which of those will be good
though . . . . . .

i know it's really hard to find a new great space in pittsburgh,
but i can't stand the irish center.
i don't like "centers" at all as locations for raves, but i also 
understand that it's difficult (but possible) to do otherwise.

Pluses: It's clean. Bathrooms arent too horrible. Has a dance floor. Has
heat. Not too far a drive from any part of Pittsburgh. Just about the right
size. No neighbors to piss off or call the cops on ya. Accoustics dont seem
to be too bad...

Minuses: Parking is iffy. Only one room. It will prolly be too crowded to
dance from like 2-4am tomorrow :(

I like it.

Some key things of goodness:
Wide open area, for me this is the memory I have of raves gone by.  You can
almost always make the space to dance.  (Except for BIZ i believe it was? :)
Multiple big flat surfaces for projections whether its lazers or other.
Early morning you can hangout on the hillside and watch the sun come up.
Regular place, damn near everyone knows how to get there.
Walkable from pitt and cmu (though painfull).
Out of the way from houses so we can be loud without probs.

Bad things: bathrooms get trashed on a regular basis.
Being popular can get VERY crowded.

well, the best memories of raves i've been to in pittsburgh
have been at sites that were not rented halls, centers, or
buildings like that.  

my favorite sites have been:

-city tunnels   (need i give  a name?)
-shopping malls
-roller rinks
-paint ball arena
-city streets 
-science museum
etc.....

i can't get excited about going to the irish center no matter
how secure, big, or whatever it is because i've been there too
many times and it's too safe.  

i'm looking forward to this renegade tonight.
i'm going ot be in town this weekend, and if i get home 
tonight, i shall be there!  

i'd very much like someone to bring back the rebelion in
both the music, and the attitude.  

from,
ryu

"in celebration of the release of Netscape source code"

not to rag on the party itself (for all i know it could be alright) but
that has got to be the geekiest thing i've ever heard put on a flyer.
aren' there better reasons to throw parties in SF? i mean, i think we can
all name a few good reasons not like this.

i'm gonna have to rant further --

a party is supposed to help get people off their computers, work,
monotonies in life, etc. which can become a potentially socio-political
act by committing a resistance --
celebrating something like netscape (whether or not it's anti-microsoft if
that's the point the party's making) to me is like being passive in
resistance, because it's branded in the cyber utopian escapist vision 
which is so popularized in culture (including rave culture) unfortunately.

lemme lay it out;

this is a party to celebrate so there's an excuse to get corporate
funding, pretty much.

no bloody computers all over. just a party. a big one. with lots of
people. and mebbe a live broadcast on the web for people who can't make
it.

geez, it's not like there HAS to be a *REAL* reason for a party now,
right?

right guys? hey.. put down the.. no! NO!! AIEEEEEEEE!!

And people bitch at me for trying to define the scene? <joke>

IMNSFHO a party is where you make it. :) Seriosly.  I think computers
SHOULD be at parties, because they should be celebrated. In my utopic world
FUN computers would be overrunning the rave scene.  Jack yourself up, jack
yourself in, and party hard with the fellow bretheren of the digital
warzone.  

Now granted I got to parties to escape computers, but I go to escape the
BAD side of computers.  The stuff that I hate, 95problems, restricted
information, oswars and so forth.  I feel for a person who would complain
if they had a couple of kickin vr systems running at a rave with no
paytoplay fee. A wall of flat lcd's spewing graphics and charging your
mind, ripping it loose from its teathered threads of reality. Whether the
style be industro destruction or trippy feelgood, computers in my world
were ment to be party tools. They can be more addictive then any drug on
the market.  Count the number of pack a day smokers that havnt had a
cigarette in 16hours because they've been coding a new util or traipsing
through irc, or overruning countries and destroying megaconglomerates. Ok,
so maybe those guys dont smoke that much. 

My point is. I shall crush below my mighty boots all ye who shall define
the scene and exclude the digital weapons of our strongest minds.

PLUR

Did I mention ive been coding for 3 days straight? If I have to write one
more public class blah extends Object {
im going to burn sun microsystems to the ground with toothpick and a razor
blade.

Do we truely have any "rights", or merely temporary privileges?  Our
world is not, as people are taught to believe, a place where people
can/will do to you what the law will allow... it is a place where
people can/will to do you what you allow them to get away with.

Please quote my text where I have implicitly stated this.  You

I think I might be doubting your status if that's the most
disgusting thing you've ever heard.  There are a lot of severely
fucked up things in this world.  In my opinion, issues concerning
materialism fall pretty low on that list.

Then perhaps you should have responded privately, instead of posting
to the entire list.

The fact remains that you left your valuables unattended in a car.
I think you've found the illusion of safety either a locked vehicle
or parking that vehicle in a "very well lit parking lot" is just
that - an illusion.

> not that it matters what the fuck i was doing!!!

Then why state it?

when i was in tokyo people would just leave theyre bikes unlocked and

I went to HyperSonics on thursday (it was REAL dead prolly cause all the
parties going on that night)... At any rate, I ran into Instigator who
informed me that I left $20 in his store earlier in the week, and he gave it
back to me :) I guess everyone isnt dishonest :)

Is it just me or does that guy need to get away from his computer more often?
I can understand that we do live in a world where things aren't safe, and
maybe i shouldn't have left my shit in my car...  but there r some people out
there who always have to say something negative just because they have nothing
better to do...

yeah...

i think its great when a society works like that. when i was in
england, i would bike around from record shop to record shop and just
lean my bike out against the window of the store while i was inside.
you didn't need to lock it, because no one was going to steal it. when
you see a $300 bike chillin outside unattended for the first time, you
are kinda set back, like: ANYONE COULD STEAL THAT! but once you
realize that that isn't an issue in some places in the world, it just
makes ya all fuzzy inside.

So who went to the renegade?  I tried to go for a few hours, but due to
various circumstances just ended up walking and driving around in that
area for a while.  It was fun anyways though.  We saw some people driving
away from and they said that there was only like a stereo and a bunch of
drunk people harassing them, so we figured it wasn't worth the walk for
the (at that point) ten minutes we would be there for.  Oh well, did it
get any better, or did it get worse, or were those people just full of
shit and it was all good the whole time?

No, I don't think you understand . . . I know where its being held too,
and all those possibilities are for the Irish Centre.  I just know that
often times the spot you are talking about is REALLY crowded and chaotic.
 Sorry If I didn't make myself clear it was 4:20 all day yesterday.

>Who's coming?

I'll be there.  Hopefully I'll be able to get that paintball mask this
time (it was a lot of fun last time), and who knows what I'll be wearing.
 I'm trying to get some new batteries for my laser pointer, so I'll
probably be moving that around while I'm dancing.

ABSOLUT

PS-I really think that the safest place for the net meet would be by the
back wall (near the entrance to the bathroom/phone area).  The only way
this place could be a bad site is if the DJ booth was there, and that'
only happened once in my experiences with the Irish Centre.  I hope there
is going to be four corner sound!

> What do people on the list think of the Irish Centre location? 

i love it, always have loved it, and always will love it. as long as
the promoter has his or her shit together, and no major incidents
occur, there's this magical instavibe that is created. when a rave is
at the irish centre, i just know ill have a good time.

10 magical moments @ the irish centre
* the light show + baggadonuts at phanny dance
* swinging on the swings
* that guy giving me a free smart drink
* lying out on the grass after many hours of dancing
* playing catch with a glowstick on a string on the lawn
* pulse (!)
* sneaking out of my friend's house and walking to and from superfly
* geoff maddock giving me a freezy-pop when i was about to melt @ biz
* sitting on a subwoofer @ 2am watching the crowd feed of the vibe
* getting off of the subwoofer and becoming a part of that vibe till i
had to leave

Here's my take on the Irish Center:  After so many events there, it really
doesn't hold anything special as a venue over, say, metropol. 

Never-the-less: Its a great space - great dancefloor - lots of room for
pgh size events - high ceilings - easy to get to - and lots of great raves
have been there. Overall the vibe is usually really good there, but its
usually because the better, more positive promoters of pgh use (can
afford) that venue.

So many great events have been there...they'r all a blur in my mind.
All acid heads in effect tonight!  I'm quite excited to see Green Velvet
and Stryke!

Remember when they used to have a chill room outside and people used to
sit in the pool?  That was awesome...I think they finally got a sound
complaint about that...it sucks, coz that would make the
inside/outsideness of the place event better.  Although I'd be afraid
*everyone* would stay outside tonight.

This weather is so pleasant! :)

tell me about it, I used to WORK for Netscape (intern there last summer).
Anyway have fun downloading the source code and searching

FWIW, I got kicked out of the sound factory for dressing like a raver.
Fuck that shit, bitch! :)

Come back to reality!  That's all the scene needs is cyber dorks playing
with computers instead of dancing and socializing at raves.  You might
as well eat some acid and stay home and program?

BTW I don't remember you having mighty boots.  Maybee I'm thinking of
someone else :p
Digital weapons...come back to earth.

well, in my opinion, almost all of the worlds problems are either 
directly or indirectly realted to the way the rich (ruling) class 
controls the lower class.....people say there are upper, lower, and 
middle classes...thats shite.....theres the poeple with all the money 
and power (large corporations) and theres everyone else, and like it or 
not everyone else lives exactly how the power lets them......so, 
actually, materialism is possibly THE main source of fucked up things in 
this world.......everyone wants to have that power and money, so theyll 
do hatever they can to get it.....
if ya want me to blather on about this more in private, mail me...

I dont think you got my points. One was I was joking to an extent, ranting
and raving about computers for the hell of it.  The other is. The party is
still what people make it. Yeah it would suck if the room was just a bunch
of terminals and people programing at it. But I severely doubt that is what
would happen.  Now granted as with any scene, it eventually is reduced to
its most basic addictive form and then has to go underground or go through
a major revolution.  Who says you need to dance in order to socialize? Who
says you cant socialize around a computer? Who says there has to be one
computer for every person? Who the hell says there wont be a dance floor? 
There is a very large distinction between a cyber *dork* and cyber *punk*
(or whatever name you  care to throw at this style of person). A cyber
*dork* would put the computer ahead of the party.  A cyber *punk* would put
the party ahead of the computer.  A cyber *dork* uses the computer AT a
party. A cyber *punk* uses the computer TO party.  Any computer that
enhances the party atmosphere is ok in my book. All the better if the guy
running the computer gets to have fun as well. You probably havent been to
many of the bigger hacking cons or you wouldnt be saying this. They have
djs sometimes.  Half the time its because the dj in question figured out
some new neat trick. (One guy had built a spin table that let him use CDs
and vynal.) But the other half its because they happen to love raves and
hacking.  
Computers arent all just running 95 or talking about linux. There are
hundreds if not thousands of sub scenes within computers.  On the
underground side you have all of the
hacking/phreaking/anarchy/coding/viriii guys.  You have the entire warez
industry which is getting bigger and bigger by the moment.  Shit the warez
industry has its own sub scenes. As I said at a previos post a bit ago the
demo groups out there that work for the warez scene usually code some damn
good trax and visuals.  I dare you to just once go to a party in Silicon
Valey and tell me you didnt have a good time. Back to my story. Youve got
the demo groups, youve got the mod groups, shit even the ansi groups are
still surviving these days even though dos is technically dead.  This is
only a small fraction of the underground.Overground you have legal versions
of pretty much everything said previos + other stuff like vr techheads, and
so forth. 


My point is you obviosly dont know that much about computers in today's day
in age if you dont think that raving will eventually have lots of
computers.  What do you think runs the splitbeam-lasers? Oooh, im sorry,
you didnt realize they PROGRAM THEM. Last irish center party they were
setting up pretty late and you could watch them do it. It was kinda funky.
I never realized just how crude it was on some systems. Just like recording
and playing back macro's at different speeds. I wanna see someone do that
by hand. :)

This isnt really a personal response any more. More of a statement in
general.  Im sick and tired of all the
hippiestic-come-back-to-earth-and-leave-the-computer shit people are up on.
If you dont know how to use the computer for fun and entertainment and
advance other people's fun and entertainment then you dont know that much
about computers.  (The global you, not the personal you)

>Come back to reality!  That's all the scene needs is cyber dorks playing
>with computers instead of dancing and socializing at raves.  You might
>as well eat some acid and stay home and program?
This is reality, and you will loose. Its only a matter of time.
As for sitting at home and eating acid and programing. Well, thats what I
do on the weekends when I dont have a party to go to. 



>BTW I don't remember you having mighty boots.  Maybee I'm thinking of
>someone else :p
Ok, maybe they arent mighty. :) I was just exagerating for the fun of it.
But they are boots. 

>Digital weapons...come back to earth.
Could you really not catch my exageration? :) I was trying to build it up
huge on purpose as a joke. But on a reality note:
The internet worm 
 The number of military sites that have been broken into recently, all of
which could have had their
contents destroyed or worse, given to other countries 
The entire mitnik case sheds light on several positions.  
And none of this is at all relevent to the amount of personal or private
information that gets passed around from person to person that shouldnt be.
 The number of stolen credit cards, social security information, bank
accounts and so forth.  People may want to think its all being done by
funny little teenagers siting behind computers. But its not.  Most of the
leaders of the top groups are well into their 30s or 40s, some with jail
time on their record.  

But in the end, I was just ranting for a reaction :)

"You might find yourself slipping in and out of an halucinatory state after
this is all over.  Just relax it will soon go away. But in the mean time...
Your Going Insane!"

This isn't important -- I just thought it was cute and wanted to share...

Last weekend it was really rainy and there were big, unavoidable puddles 
everywhere.  My boyfriend (who's also on this list; who is he?  Big secret!)
was visiting me at school for the weekend, and he actually lifted my phat pants
on one side of me so they wouldn't get all wet.  

That's all.

This is just a reminder about my online music site with pre- recorded 90
minutes mixes

www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/pb3j/tapes.htm

All you need is a 14.4 kps connection and Real-Audio's software, which
is downloadable from their site which is linked to mine

The current mix is more on the housy side, but I usually put up techno.I
change my mix every 1-2 weeks. I'm putting a new one up this weekend.

THANX and let me know what you think.

Paul
ps. I'm currently building a links page to other deejays homepages,
preferably of people who spin techno (not trance or jungle., sorry...
but maybe I'll include house) If you'd like to give me your link, please

ok, i advise "responsibility and precaution".  my car was broken into 
twice and so now i always park it under lights and i spent an ungodly 
amount of money on an alarm.  but it just seemed like there was a side 
of being ripped off that was ignored.  instead of just saying "be 
careful and don't leave valuable shit in the car," someone could say, 
"hey, what happened sucked and i'm sorry, but be more careful next 
time."  
and it's not necessarily sympathy that i was bemoaning the lack of.  i 
was sympathetic because i know what it's like to be stolen from.  a 
little bit of consideration for other people's feelings was all i was 
looking for.  the last thing that i wanted to hear when i got ripped off 
was "girlie, you're stupid for leaving shit you liked in the car."  


k bye =)

Ummmm...  who do you think started the scene in the first place?

A bunch of 'cyber dorks', as you call them, playing with their computers
and their piano lessons and their 'obsolete' turntables.

As one of those you deride, a rave is the perfect place for people, music,
and toys to get together for one hell of a party.

Hate to say it, but it's usually too loud to socialise...

Anyone know sign language?

obsequious mode:

There's a difference between the two?

Viruses...  memes...  old tech in new ways...  the over-publicised and
impractical (at this point) microwave bombs and EMPs...

Not so much digital as technological.

No shit...and also, it seems, according to what he said, if you leave 
your car parked somewhere, and it gets stolen, it's YOUR fault, 
because you shouldn't be so stupid to leave something so valuable out 
like that...sheesh

Not to go off on another "back in the day" thread, but when our 
"scene" was first coming about, many a cyber dork you would find at 
parties, likely wearing computer hardware, etc..so anyways, where'd 
this whole "raves are only for ravers" mentality come from anyways?  
I think it really sucks..just go, and have fun, and let whoever else 
wants to go have fun too, without being discriminating against for 
being a "computer geek", or whatever else they may choose to be...

whoa...how is it degrading to lift a ladies pants so she doesn't get

see how it could be degrading, unless your one of those shaved head 
neo-feminist womens lib people who would castrate a man for trying to

Well, this will probably be a long message, so bare with me . . .

All in all I had a fucking great time.  Like frankie-g said, this was
just like the old sunshine kids parties  . . . but in many aspects
better.

Lights:  This was oen fo the most solid light shows I've ever seen.  The
individual lights were the bomb, but the overall effect of them was
spectacular.  The front rack over the entire stage had about 15-20 lights
on it of two different types.  One was the kind where the light shoots
out the end of it and you don't really see anything moving, but the
lights can spell stuff out and do various other cool shit, and these were
the really good versions of those lights.  The other kind were the type
where the mirror moves and the light comes out of the bottom of one side
of it. There were also two other groupings of two or three lights at the
end of the dancefloor section.  These lights were not only highquality
and well placed, but whoever was controlling them was diong a great job. 
If an ambient section came up, a few of the lights would search around
the room and then as the buildup came they moved more and more, untill
the beat came in at which point, the ones that weren't turned on, went
buckwild along with the other ones.  All in all a great effect,
expecially looking from far back.  
	The video footage was great as well.  I had seen the team that
did it before at sounds from planet bass, and it was just as good the
second time.  Great job.

DJs:  the intigator was first, playing a great set.  His style is really
evolving and in my opinion for the better.  I liked him before a lot, but
he just keeps imporving and improving.  Next up was alaska, who played a
pretty solid set as well.  He played a good bit of ragga stuff, and just
in general a lot of hardstepping stuff.  People were getting into it a
suprising amount, although I still can't understand people's dislike for
dancing to jungle at all.  Alaska's mixing was pretty smooth and had a
nice flow witht eh selection.  Next up was Dave Trance.  This was just
incredible.  Some of the best trance I've heard in a long time.  I was
expecting something different from teh description sent into the list,
but was very happy with what I heard.  It was very "dynamic" and really
got the crowd moving.  The build ups were incredible, and the break was
never disappointing.  Kind of reminded me of sasha and john digweed type
stuff.  Then came Green Velvet . . . wow.  what a character.  He had on a
crazy green wig a tight bizarre camo. shirt, and some tight pants and
sunglasses.  I only heard about half and hour of his set, but what I
heard I liked.  It sounded a good bit like richie hawtin/plastikman
stuff, but not quite as mental. 

Vibe: Yeah.  although I wasn't really looking, I didn't see many shady
people, and everybody seemed to be having a good time.  There was soo
much PLUR going on If you were flying above it and looked down, I'm
pretty sure you would just see a big smiley face.  I recieved all sorts
of hugs from random people I somehow ended up dancing with and met a
whole bunch of other people too.  this was the kind of event that makes
you remember why you started raving in the first place.  At 2:30 when
they started allowing re-admittance, the lawn crew was in full effects.

OthEr things:  Hardly anybody was flipping out completely.  The worst I
saw was the girl that had a light blue shirt on with short hair and was
hanging all over everybody.  When i saw her she gave me a big ass hug and
said "Hi I'm christy, who are you?"  And then after talking to her for a
little bit, she started dancing, as if she wanted me to dance with her,
so I did, and then after a little bit she stopped and said, "Hey, I want
you to meet somebody . . . this is my boyfriend so-and-so."  and the way
I was dancing with her would have made most boyfriends come over and give
me a beat down, but he was just like, "Hey, I seen you around."  And then
the girl said, "He doesn't mind me dancing with other people, cause he
knows who I go home to."  And I was just kind of like, "whatever".  And

hen throughout the night I saw her hanging all over everybody and their
mom, including digital jesus.  That was really the only person I saw
really out of it, and most people just sEEmed to be having a great time
rollin' around, including me :)

I didn't make it to the net meet . . . sorry.  Was it a success?  I saw
Spike and I think I saw trout soup . . . do you have a teddy bear
backpack?  Hossam was also doing the intro's and outro's for all the DJs,
so I saw him.

that's about it,

About this whole stealing thing, I have never had a problem at PGH
events, and I have always left my stuff unattended.  I left my bag right
on teh stage last night for the entire night and left with everything I
came in with.  Once my wallet fell out of my pocket and I went to the
ticket guy and asked if anyone had turned in a wallet, and he said yeah .
. . here: and gave me my wallet with all the money still in it.  I've
tried to do the same thing myself too, if I ever find anything.  The
worst thing that's every happened to me was I got ripped off for some
"rave-accesories" once, but that was from a shady individual and I
learned my lesson.

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org

Just while people are still talking about getting their stuff stolen...

At one of the only two Pittsburgh raves I have ever been to I had a brand new
Hookups sweatshirt and about four unopened Gatorade bottles taken out of my
closed bookbag that was lying no more than four or five feet from where I was
lying on the floor.  I was feeling very sick to my stomach that night, so
that's why I was lying down; but I was not sleeping.  I swear I had my eyes on
that bag for hours, and someone STILL managed to get into it and clean it out. 
Of course, I couldn't have cared less about the drinks -- but my brand spanking
new, expensive sweatshirt was a real loss.  I guess those sorts of things just
happen sometimes, and it's horrible when they do -- but as long as there are
assholes in the world (and yes, there are those of the asshole persuasion in
our scene too), there's going to be shit like this going on.

The other thing that bugged me about this party (I forget the name of it... it
was at the "Romp n' Roll" skating rink, last September, I think) was that yes,
I was very sick -- I ended up eating some nasty nachos and throwing up in some
dark corner -- and the whole while the security and other various people were
walking by me, looking at me, and not a single person asked if I were all right
or if I needed to be taken anywhere or anything like that.  And I've usually
found that people at parties are exactly the opposite -- they tend to care if
you're okay, that sort of thing.  All I know is, if there had really been an
actual emergency and I had needed, say perhaps, to be taken to a hospital (I
just had an upset stomach, but it could have been worse) -- there would have
been no one, not even the security, to have helped me.

This was the absolute worst, most un-plurry party I have ever been to -- and
the theft of my sweatshirt was the icing on the cake.

Basically, I'm trying to let people know that if you've ever been ripped off,
or just had the horrble realization that all people are not as nice as they
should be -- I feel for you.

alright, my main point is that chivalry is a practice commonly used 
during that period in which women had little to no real rights...... its 
just an unnecessary reminder of those times....id like to think that 
theres a difference between common courtesy and stupid stuff like 
holding up someones pants......the point is is that if i were a female 
in such a position, i would not necessarily be offended, but definitely 
be uncomfortable......

Well I don't know what it is...but I can not have a good time in Cincinatti or
Dayton. Am I alone on this? ANWAYZ...

Well first off all we called the info line and looked over flyers for the
price of the party..no where could that be found..We get there to find out
it's $25 to get in...which is basically what I expected, so no surprise there.

The venue SUCKED!! There were 2 rooms...but they were sperated by plastic...so
It wasn't hard to hear what was playing in the next room..Therefore I found
the sound of the party to be SHITTY. What was w/ the floors?? I thought it was
over waxing, but the floors were sweating...I found this to be a very
undanceable condition..not to mention I saw a few kids fall on their asses it
was so damn slippery. Music was pretty good, you just couldn't dance
however... Carlos and DJ Funk were no shows. 

Security and Cops were ASSHOLES. 

Maybe it's just me...but everytime I go to Cincy or Dayton. or
Springfield..there is no vibe..it just sucks, so then I think..well maybe it's
me..so I create a vibe of my own and people look at you like you are some kind
of fruit loop because you try and create conversation or create anything w/ a
total stranger...and they make a big deal out of it....What is going on
people??  Some guy was telling me about how someone of the same sex tried to
hug him and he wasn't into it...Shit like that just really fucking erks me. Im
not saying everyone from there is like this...I have met some really awesome
kids from there, but man..some of these new comers really need to get a
clue..read up on the spirit of raveing....something, anything.. Im not saying
Im miss rave goddess..Im not at all, but atleast I ENJOY making an
effort..even if it's small..

Sorry about the bitching!! If you wann flame me e-mail me...
Love, Amy

attention!:

i found a really nice watch on the dancerfloor (way-up-front right, facing
the dj booth).  i picked it up so as to not grind it into the ground like
one of the those pharmacist tools.  i put it in my pocket because i didn't
see anyone around looking for one.  but, i forgot to leave it with the door
people.  i don't want to keep it because [we know why] and everytime i look
at it i'll probably get progressively more insane.  so, how do i relay this
information back to the promoter?

yes yes yes, cheer was fun.  all of the music from cajmere to the end of
stryke's set was continuous "the shit" music -- i just wasn't in the mode
for the others.  i ripped my pants, drank one gallon of liquid.  why was the
floor all wet?  was it from the outside or was it condensation?  i saw kay,
but didn't have the intestines to approach her :(  and i missed the net
meet.  i was in the b-room hallway for about ten minutes past two but then
we just left because there were so many people there.  was i in the right
place?

Geez, the girl obviously liked it. And it was her BF. And criticizing
her action for some greater statement about society is a thin argument,
because nobody does stuff like that anymore. It was a romantic gesture,
because it is atypical and coming from somebody who is already in a
relationship with her. It's chivalry when it is in the "courting"
just-getting-to-meet-you phase -- and if you really think chivalry is
non-existant today, than you're fooling yourself, because they sure
exists, it's just in a different context. Look at how a guys and girls
have to court one another. I'm not gonna go into it since there's too
much to start, and it's not like all these modern (or even old) forms of
chivalry are easy to criticize because it happens out of the greater
context of society and thus very difficult to un-do. Like, today, when a
guy buys a girl a drink at a bar to get or keep her attention, do you
really think he's not giving the woman her ability to drink by buying
her drink for her?

I was wondering if anybody caught the flim "Modulations" playing at the
cleveland film festival. It was a pretty good film, though it seemed to
focus more on house music and rave culture then it did on the actual
history of electronic music... still it had some neat bits with LTJ
Bukem and Tom Jenkinson (of squarepusher fame).

In a message dated 98-03-28 21:32:28 EST, you write:

<< ok, i advise "responsibility and precaution".  my car was broken into 
 twice and so now i always park it under lights and i spent an ungodly 
 amount of money on an alarm.  but it just seemed like there was a side 
 of being ripped off that was ignored.  instead of just saying "be 
 careful and don't leave valuable shit in the car," someone could say, 
 "hey, what happened sucked and i'm sorry, but be more careful next 
 time."  
 and it's not necessarily sympathy that i was bemoaning the lack of.  i 
 was sympathetic because i know what it's like to be stolen from.  a 
 little bit of consideration for other people's feelings was all i was 
 looking for.  the last thing that i wanted to hear when i got ripped off 
 was "girlie, you're stupid for leaving shit you liked in the car."

Thank you... you read my mind.

This party rocked ass.
At first I was offended by the comercializm present. (Atleas they coulda
kept the glowstick sellers off the 'actual' dance floor) Felt toomuch like
a basketball game.  But about halfway through my trip I had a 'revalation'
and now dont mind it so much.

at least the one girl was dancing while she peddled (or was there only one
girl =] ?)

does anyone care if the party is at the irish centre?  i mean it is just a
box like any other building.  i was still able to untangle my head while
dancing in the same manner.  however, this is only my second irish centre
party.

How much do they charge for a show . . . and why aren't you giving the

First off lemme say Cheer Rocked!

Whoever gave the review of the lights was right on... they were awesome...
It seemed like half of them were off for the first half of the night tho?

At any rate... The Sound system wasn't all that buff imho... seemed not even
as loud as SCJ usually gets. It did not seem to be as loud as BIZ, and it
looked like about half the amount of speakers or less than they had at
BIZ... Having said that, It was still loud enough :)

All of the DJs were kicking... nuff said.

Having rentry and all that rocked... man I couldnt imagine an event in there
in the summer with no rentry... it was hot as hell inside till they opened
all the doors... Sitting on the grass seemed to promote ALOT of plur too...
people were just so friendly :)

Made it to the netmeet, it was short and sweet for me tho... there wasnt
anyplace to stand, either there or anywhere else in the building... if we
knew about rentry in the first place we coulda set it up by the swings or
something... mebby next time.

The security was cool as shit... saw them bust this chick with a bag of pot
at the door... she just had it sitting in her purse. you woulda figured she
would have hidden it or something... anyways... they just dumped it in the
trashcan and let her in. That's how security SHOULD be. (that brings me to
the quote of the night from one of the security guards whom I won't mention
thier name "I grew up in the Just Say Yes generation." bwahahahaha)

Speaking of drugs... prolly what ruined my night was some bad E. I dont mean
weak, it was doped with all kinds of crap. I took one hit bout 11pm, and was
feeling something but it wasnt E, mebby like 1/4 e... so like 3:30am I took
the other hit... then like 5am I was sick as a dog... I dunno what was in
it... wasnt LSD or anything I'm familiar with... but that shit sux. I
shoulda known better cause the dude who sold it with me was trying to get me
to buy like 10hits for $150... I cant understand why he'd screw with me when
he knows I'm good for buying at least 2 hits every time I see him... oh
well... live and learn. I saw an abnormally high number of sleeping people
(that's whot it made me wanna do) and wondered if they took the same thing.

well, big up to House Of Styles :)

was he up on the stage most of the time?  i met him once awhile ago, dunno
if it was him.....

lights were excellent,,,,  i love emulators!  gotta get one for my room!
they seemed to lack good programming, but the trackspots were awesome.
sound was at a bearable level, everyone else whined about it being too
quiet, but i'm losing my hearing as it is and the quieter the better  ;)
had fun, especially enjoyed the frisking down by pghs finest!!!  (kidding)
it was fun talking to them while "under the influence"  heheheheheee.

i missed trevors set, oh well, such is life.  most of the music was pretty
entertaining.

i also liked everyone hanging out on the hill in the early morning, it was
pretty cool.

hm... johnny's also dj, so I really doubt that he thinks turntables are
obsolete.

the last rave i went to was planet bass. rather late for a review but
here goes anyway. it's nights like that that make life worth living. the
vibe was strong, hit you hard as soon as you got in. the trippy room off
to the side was the best, go in there and jut lose self in the world of
sound. taking drugs at a rave seems sort of redundant to me, the music
itself is so much more powerfully ecstatic mind-bending than a chemical
could be and still leave me with the ability to balance and dance. and
then the big happy room was great too, with the awesome computer
graphics dancing on the wall amidst the people. was fun watching the
monitors and kids pushing buttons behind then. i brought a group of
fellow cmu geek friends who hadn't been out dancing before, and they
were all surprised to find what great fun it was. went to my first
net-meet, everyone there was cool, i got to hug jennifer, the guy behind
the counter gave me a fruity drink on the house. then i went back to
dancing again, dancing is such bliss. but i realised my shoes really
aren't comfy to dance for long in anymore, it's time for new ones. i
ended up just taking them off and dancing in my socks. so, was wondering,
could anyone recommend shoes that they've found especially comfortable
to dance for hours in? bonus if they're also comfy for walking long
distances. thanks!
on cyberpartying- when i read shwanke's post my initial reaction was
Yes! Happy thoughts! a combination of all of my current obsessions into
one place, one heck of a party. i kind of expected that, in a group of
kids that uses computers to find out about events where they can listen
to music generated with the help of computers and enhanced by lights
controlled by computers and often accompanying computer-generated
graphics shows, a significant percentage would sympathize with, or at
least plurrily accept, cyberpunkygeek dreams. instead, i see
>why don't you just go join vrave and give up real human contact altogether.
how ugly! and i know erica is such a beautiful person from the work she
did for planet bass and that awesome message comparing taoism and raves
she forwarded. 
(btw, i've always found raving, dancing, techno, to be very taoist in
nature, beyond words, understanding coming only through experience of
the event, feeling the energy from everywhere around you)
but wtf is this????? 
one of the aspects of this scene that's most appealed to me is the idea
of PLUR, Peace Love Unity Respect for each other, people from all
different backgrounds and interests brought together in the rave, the
music, all energies contributing to a one beautiful color-swirled vibe.
but so PLUR only needs to apply to kids who fit neatly into your view of
your subculture without overlap into any others?

Thank you. Though I personally dont agree with the PLUR perspective, I
respect and sometimes envy those that do.  The peace I can do but the
mindless love/unity/respect thing is too dangers for both my mentality and
from whence I grew up. And I refuse to change the way I think or act just
to fit in with the rest of the scene. Maybe enough mingling it will rub off
on me.  I prefer to pick my friends and get to know them.  I am *NOT*
bashing PLUR I am just telling what I think of it.  

I also wanted to make a few public corrections concerning my CyberPunk'esh
post:

I wasnt saying that i was a CyberPunk, thats what people called me. I dont
name my style of living I live the way I see fit and let others do the naming.
Not all CyberPunk's as I was using the term are hardasses with razoredge
thinking and feeling. I was trying to simply convey someone who thinks that
the computer and other technology is a great asset to society and is using
it as a cultural accessory instead of simply a tool.

Speaking of.  I also want to point out that a computer is not just a Box
that you sit in front of and has a keyboard and a mouse or whatever.  A
computer today is nearly anything that is technological.  Maybe I should
have used the word technology instead of computer.

And finally, I wish to thank everyone for either ignoring or replying
personal to my post. :)
(That is, thank you for being YOU! :)

Speaking of tao etc, has anyone else played with meditation or
concentration at raves?
Im interested in what other people are doing in this area (preferable to
staying away from beliefe systems and more towards methods).

I caught it.

As a "History of Electronic Music" i thought it did a poor job, but i found
it fascinating and enjoyable for other reasons.  The integration of audio
and visual stimuli was really nice, it got close to recreating the rave
experience on a lower level.  In fact, there was mention made in the movie
of how the music is no longer a 2D--audio only-- experience.  neat point.
The education of early early electronics/audio geeks into the film was
really good, but i thought that it didn't *quite* explain the relationship
of what say,"La Musica Concrete" exactly meant to, say modern garage house.
Those are examples.  The focus of Disco's influence on modern culture/modern
music culture was too little too late IMHO and they never once mentioned the
technics 1200 MKII and it's influence.  "the cutting room floor" she said.
The only mention of how "electronic music" plays a role in pop music today
was cursory; "..even if you hear an acoustic instrument, it's still
electronic music."  The almost total exclusion of industrial was bothersome,
i was really interested in *learning* something about that area.  The
ambient artists were well represented.

all in all i give it an 8.5/10.  I think it would really do well in theaters
and would be fun to go see with your friends.  It would begin educate the
neophyte raver and has a great sound track.  I could go on and on, but what
do i know...and besides...how much history could you fit into one
feature-length film?

Isn't dancing, at its essence, meditational excercise?

Putting your mind in a receptive state, clearing it of conscious
thought, achieving peace of mind, ridding yourself of negative
thoughts and frustrations... in the attempt to become a pure conduit
of the music that surrounds you, your conscious mind becomes quiet
and the unconscious feelings and energies manifest themselves
through your movement.

Or as I've indicated in a past post, don't think... feel.

It's a wonderfuly dichotmous relationship between being so
incredibly physically expressive and yet inwardly, tranquil.  

> Im interested in what other people are doing in this area (preferable to

I practice meditation outside of raves; interestingly my interest (and
success) at it was intitiated by events at them.  Normally I would
suggest that something like meditation isn't something that you can
kick-start into working.  By this I mean you're not usually just
going to be able to sit down one afternoon and "try really hard" and
then have some spiffy revelation that mediation can work for you.
It normally takes honest work and continued practice.

With this in mind, however, I also feel there are all sorts of
possibilities for epiphenomenal situations that can open people up
into avenues of thought they never would have acknowledged
otherwise.  My life-changing experience at Jak-O-Lantern being one
of them.

Or in other words (the "leading a horse to water..." department),
sometimes that push into the lake can come from surprising sources.

;)

Agreed. Though for some reason my legs dont wish to move except in rare
cases.  My upper body loves to move though.  

>It's a wonderfuly dichotmous relationship between being so
>incredibly physically expressive and yet inwardly, tranquil.  
Hmm, I would more view it as a unity of the trinity (erf didnt I wanna stay
away from the theory ahh well, its all part of the expansion of
understanding).  With the pure conduit of the astral (feeling), and the
mind combined running through to the third body that of the physical body.
With letting each of the three run free they interact as they see fit each
has its own equality in control of the situation no two in control of the
third or one over powering. As is usual in day to day life with astral
controling mind controlling body or mind controlling astral controlling
body depending on the person in question. 

For references sake im using astral as defined in Mouni Sadhu's
"Concentration" not the astral as in astral plane though the two may be one
and the same on occasion.

I was more implying the application of traditional meditation such as the
clearing of the mind. Consciosly focusing your 'existance' (for the lack of
a better word) on quite simply nothing.

Ohh most definitly. I'm fairly new to meditation in its self.
Unfortunately my hectic schedule doesnt allow me to devote the time each
day to it. Hoping for the time this summer so that I can get regular on it
to have it a part of my life by next year instead of yet another thing to
factor in this time around.

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

hey all,

  just a note to let you know that my new cd is now
available.  it's called "power made flesh" and is 73 minutes
worth of 10 tracks.  it's a more extreme version of some 
of my past work.  meaning the soft stuff is softer, the
hard stuff harder.  and i think it's pretty eclectic as well.

  i would love to be able to give this one away like i 
did the last, but can't afford it, so i'm gonna have to charge
somethign for it.  i'm selling it for $5 (including postage anywhere).
that is how much it costs me to make each cd and package 
it.  if $5 is a problem, email me and we can work something out.

  there's mp3 samples on my web page of the tracks, as well
as other info about the album if you're interested...go to:

http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/jwz109

  thanks for your time, and if anyone is subbed to ne-raves
or any other, and would like to forward this, feel free.  i don't
want to directly post to a list i'm not on.

adios,
ryu

yeah i have this record and i know what sound that grinding/grating is,
but it's synchronized with the rhythm of the track at least on my copy,
so as far as i know, it's on purpose. i kind of like that sound, but at
the same time it's kind of annoying, because it's so persistant. i try not
to let that part of the track play for very long, like mix it out fast or
something.

i haven't noticed anything strange about that one, but i'll check it when
i go home. you could e-mail t-1000 (DJT1000@aol.com) if you want to ask
him directly.

Does anybody know if either of these kats/phenomenons are around any
longer?  Soma Mestizo being the very fine 'triphop' band, who I only
actually got to see once live, and DJ Pheonix, being a Happy Hardcore DJ
and the promoter behind last year's TECHNIQUE?

I'm looking to get in touch with them, so if you know any #'s/email that I
can reach them, I'd be quite grateful.

Very well put.  I think this is also part of the reason that people like
to take drugs at raves: because it helps them focus on only the music and
really becoe part of the music rather than something trying to keep up. 
Don't various cultures use drugs to enhance meditation?

>Or as I've indicated in a past post, don't think... feel.

I think what you mean is:
"Let me think"
"Don't think! Feeeeeeeeeeeeel.
 It is like a finger pointing a way to the moon.
 Don't concentrate on the finger or you will miss all the heavenly
glory."

>It's a wonderfuly dichotmous relationship between being so

Very very true.

Well, that's true and all . . . BUT when that incredible experience of
being at a rave overlaps with another incredible experience, 2+2 does not
equal 4.

If anybody reading this doesn't give a shit about shoe stuff skip over
this paragraph cause it will take a while:

Hmmm . . . I've had a good bit of experience with shoes and dancing,
cause I always seem to have problems in this area.  For a while I had a
pair of Nike running shoes that have a little trail symbol on them and
are supposed to be made for running in the park and stuff, because I
figured these would have a lot of traction which would be good for
gripping the ground with . . . but the thing is is that in order to
increase stability the sole came out of the shoe at an angle on the toe
and this led to blisters . . . which are not fun to get while dancing. 
Then i got a pair of Reebok Run DMXs and these are some of the coolest
looking shoes in the world in my opinion, but anyways, they are great for
dancing in and have a really cool air cusioning system that makes it feel
like you are walking on a pillow, and the soles are rounded so, I didn't
get the problem I got with the Nike trail shoes.  BUT, after dancing in
them a lot I found that the bottoms of them on one shoe wore out a whole
bunch.  The bottom of them are clear material and I think this is part of
the problem.  So in order to stop my shoes from being destroyed I
purchased a pair of wrestling shoes on the advice of a friend who said
they are great.  And they are, they give you a lot of grip and it is like
you aren't wearing shoes at all, but you are . . . BUT beacuse of the
fact that they don't have any cushioning after wearing the for a while,
your feet start to hurt (so now I just wear them for an hour or so, or
untill my feet start to hurt).  And now I am looking into getting some
new shoes.  I think I'm going to get the new version of the DMX, which
I'm not sure if it is even out yet, but the forefoot sole section is no
longer the clear material but normal material and it still has a cool air
cusioning system.  They cost about $90. but really are great shoes. 
Another shoe you may want to try is the Adidas Equipment solution.  They
are supposed to have a lot of control.

ABSOLUT

Hmm, this shoe thread is pretty interesting.  Seems like one of the raver
clothing manufacturers should come out with a shoe made for dancin' all
night in (so far I've only seen wierd unconfortable platform shoes from
them).

Anywayz, in the hopes of saving my already beaten and twisted feet, today
I purchased a pair of cushioned insoles from ExerdX (local drug store).
They just slipped into my old pair of running shoes and I was ready to go!
Can't comment on the dancing comfort but so far walking around is MUCH
nicer and I look forward to putting them into effect at the next rave.

pEace and foot comfort,
jP

I recently did a mini survey of shoes at a rave and came up with a minor
common pattern, and went and bought some Vans... I guess basically any shoe
with the same type of sole will do, I got Vans in particular cause when I
was in highschool, all the skaters wore them cause they got good grip when
you need it, but if you wanna slide, they'll let you slide when you need to
as well. They really are comfortable... I originally bought them just to
dance in but after breaking them in, I cant seem to not wear them :) Well,
at least try a pair on or something.

Dan

<<Well I don't know what it is...but I can not have a good time in Cincinatti
or
Dayton. Am I alone on this? ANWAYZ...>>

i actually had a decent time @ this party...i've also had a good time @
ENERGIZE 
and @ FREAK SHOW in dayton before...plus how can u dis da city who was the
home of Playboy's centerfold for this month ;P~

<<Well first off all we called the info line and looked over flyers for the
price of the party..no where could that be found..We get there to find out
it's $25 to get in...which is basically what I expected, so no surprise
there.>>

no diggity doubt!...$25 wuz a bit steep!!...especially if carlos & dj funk
were
no shows!...this party really should've been $20 max!...i can't see how some
promotors feel comfortable about rippin their own kind off....

<<The venue SUCKED!! There were 2 rooms...but they were sperated by
plastic...so
It wasn't hard to hear what was playing in the next room..Therefore I found
the sound of the party to be SHITTY. What was w/ the floors?? I thought it was
over waxing, but the floors were sweating...I found this to be a very
undanceable condition..not to mention I saw a few kids fall on their asses it
was so damn slippery. Music was pretty good, you just couldn't dance>>

the sweaty floors were quite annoying, but it wuz amusing watchin
breaker dan & shawn when they finally gathered up those mats for the
break circle...'til then most of the breakers were literally fallin on
their asses!...speakin o which, watchin dan & tara win the break competition
wuz what made the night for me!...nuthin beats watchin peeps dat move
well to the music...and da b-girlies!...ooooh nelly!

<<Security and Cops were ASSHOLES. >>

din't notice them...wuzn't half as bad as the AGORA security cru up in
cleveland!

<< Some guy was telling me about how someone of the same sex tried to
hug him and he wasn't into it...Shit like that just really fucking erks me. Im
not saying everyone from there is like this...I have met some really awesome
kids from there, but man..some of these new comers really need to get a
clue..read up on the spirit of raveing....something, anything.. Im not saying
Im miss rave goddess..Im not at all, but atleast I ENJOY making an
effort..even if it's small..>>

pfft, i disagree, i think amy IS a rave goddess!...but yah, the gangsta wanna-
be 
vibe wuz a bit thick there!...but i partially blame myself, i din't really go 
outta my way to meet new peeps...too worried 'bout my own kidz...but there
were def a few fly rave chicas i just din't have da guts to approach...what 
can i say, i'm really a shy guy IRL...

shout outs to the kidz dat made my night: rec shop cru: breaker dan aka
'smarty
pants', his twin bro shawn, sylvia from france (who had a blast videotapin
us especially after the party @ McD's), aron, chris, sammy, tara, li'l steph,
all the cinci breakers especially j rock (b-day boy) & tsunami, da porn cru: 
lisa, amy funkybizz, sharon, ehren, travis, jessica, corie & andrea and oh
yeah...
special thanx to kimyon who hooked us up w/ a mixed tape (i'll hafta give him

i don't have contacts for phoenix, but i do know that he no
long spins under that name and no longer spins happy hardcore.
from what i understand, he's a trip hop dj now.  if you'd still
like to talk to him, i know someone who knows him and can

       You have just been hugged!! That's right, there's no getting out of it
this time!! This is the start of a full-scale Hug O' War! So hug everyone you
know!!! Hug your friends, your enemies, everyone!! With all the other forwards
out there, I thought this would be a good one to start. The hug is my favorite
sign of affection. It can mean so much, and many things at the same time. It
can be a sign of love, friendship, comfort or anything! So here you go. There
is no curse on this letter. It does not guarantee you good or bad luck. All I
can say it will do is brighten someone's day. I mean, we all need a hug once
in awhile. So send this on if you'd like, to anyone who may need a hug, send
it back to whoever sent it to you, send it back to me!! Heaven only knows, I
could REALLY use a hug sometimes. So anyway, send this on and show someone you
care!! 
      
      Hug O' War
      
      I will not play at Tug O' War
      I'd rather play at Hug O' War
      Where everyone hugs, instead of tugs
      And everyone giggles and rolls on the rug
      Where everyone kisses
      and everyone grins
      and everyone cuddles
      and everyone wins
                        ~~Shel Silverstein
    
    Smile and Be Happy!

hmmm....a few months ago, i was asleep on the floor at a partyu and a 
mixtape i had just bought fell ouit of my pocket, and when i woke up and 
realized it wasnt there, i figured that someone prolly justsaw it and 
picked it up....but then i looked around and it was laying here in full 
view......and it was a bomb tape...mickey finn and darren j. spinnin 
some oldschool ragga......noone fucked with it while i was 
asleep....also during the same nap, some guy who didnt see me was

It's a line from the Tao Te Ching.>>

i dunno, i felt some what obligated to make a comment on this, since
i am asian...talk about american bastardization of eastern philosophy
...that quote is taken way out of context...as finephunk has already 
stated, anybody that has had any experiences in the eastern culture
would know that the eastern society is all about respect (especially
toward their elders) and spirituality...the last thing on their minds
is materialism and stealing from the rich to give to the poor...

the Tao Te Ching was written long ago, when there were asian emperors
and peasants...the quote is better interpreted as those who start out
poor can only get richer (not only in wealth but happiness), and those
who are born wealthy often have to learn about respect for the little
people in addition to respect for the little things (because it is the little
things that can bring about the greatest and purest joys)...

This is why if u watch alot of martial arts movies, the masters like
to start their pupils out very young and very poor, so they can learn
respect for their elders and respect for the little things (like food,
water, the earth, the animals, etc.)...and they will literally starve
and beat the young pupil until he learns enough respect, because
from there can one truly appreciate the martial arts...

It is a little known fact that martial arts was what inspired break
dancing, I didn't even learn this myself until i interviewed Crazy Legs
from Rock Steady Crew...this is exactly why RSC preaches respect for
your body (drugs are not allowed in RSC) and respect for your brothers
and sisters above all...

i have a pair of "adidas response tr"'s......theyre trail running 
shoes.....they come out with them in a new color scheme every few months 
now.....they are the best raving shoes for two reasons....they have that 
adiprene sole thats soft as hell ....plus (for alla the big (but not 
excessively large) pants crew) theres a little ledge type thing that 
sticks out of the back of the sole that stops your pants from dragging 
on the ground so much.....plus they come in nice colors and look 
generally cool...
i got mine in august (for $84) and i just officialy retired them this 
week.....thyre the only shoes ive danced in since then, and they still 
felt good on my feet after being beaten for so long.....i HIGHLY 
recommend these shoes.....to look at em go to

yeah the wrestling shoes are cool because you have perfect traction, and
your feet interface well with the floor, but i had the sore feet problem
too. they're not durable or warm either (the shoes not the feet!). now my
best shoes are these reebok crosstrainers i got at gabriel bros. (for only
$28!) i don't know what model they are and if they are dmx technology, but
they have a clear bubble in the sole in the middle of the heel + arch, and
a triangular bubble on the back and little silver reflective things. they
are black and metallic blue on top and with 2 white parts on the sides +
the soles are white and marshmallowly soft. =P so if you see shoes like
this, get them they are so comfortable, also for walking and probably
running. speaking of which i can't even do now, i fell yesterday skating
and fucked up my knee, it got twisted. it hurt so much i couldn't even
sleep last night. so now i am going to limp (probably a funny sight) to
the health center for crutches and massive doses of painkillers. no
dancing for me. =/

Hate to be the one to break it to you but there aren't any good record
stores in cleveland, especially if you're looking for dnb.  I've heard
this straight from the source (a friend who lives there who is always
complaining about it).  He come here (pgh) to buy his stuff, which is
what you should probably do.  Future Sounds in Squirrel Hill is the
best place around here.  They just moved to a new location and are
expanding their dnb selection.  You can also do mail orders over the
phone: 412-421-3727. 
If you're ever in town on a Saturday I'm usually there.

I would think that any text associated withe the TTC would be
considered "out of context".  Any translation, if you could even
call it that, never really represents the original text.  The
original, if there was any (up to speculation/myth), has been mixed
up, mistranscribed and re-interpreted who knows how many times over
the many thousands of years since Lao Tzu (supposedly) originally
wrote it.  Our language is incapable of presenting it in proper
structure and I fear it may be missing many, if not most, of its
original philological connections.

We're each left to our own interpretation.

I searched the archives and found no such message of finephunk's.
Actually, I looked at any related topics for the past month and
found nothing even close to this.  Would you care to clarify?

Where have I either attributed or advocated "stealing from the rich
and giving to the poor"?  And as for materialism...

> the Tao Te Ching was written long ago, when there were asian emperors
> and peasants...

It depends on what you read and who you talk to, but from what I can
gather ole' Lao is generally attributed to have written the TTC
somewhere around 450-500 BC.  This was during the Chou dynasty, and
the government was pretty opressive and tyrannical back then. 
Persecutions, imprisonment and pillaging was rampant. 

It very much was a situation of (quoting more Laoist thought):

	Wearing fine clothes,
	Bearing sharp swords,
	Glutting with food and drink,
	Hoarding wealth and possessions -
	These are the ways of theft,
	And far from the Way.
   
...and perhaps, more in line with my original quotation (and in a
way what I think you were reaching at in your defense):

	What is higher is pulled down, and what is lower is raised up;
	What is taller is shortened, and what is thinner is broadened;
	Nature's motion decreases those who have more than they need
	And increases those who need more than they have.
	It is not so with Man.
	Man decreases those who need more than they have
	And increases those who have more than they need.

I put forth, however, that materialism is something that was most
definitely on the minds of the people of that time and place.  Where
your original point of "eastern society being all 'bout respect and
spirituality" fits in with this, I'd wager would be several more
years down the road (that fat guy Siddhartha and his ilk).

Taoism worshiped a natural, soft and yielding way of life.  Buddhism's
doctrines were more concerned with what happened in the next world,
not this one (but one of its basic truths is the escape from
suffering via freedom from material desires and the "self").
Confucious was basically a humanist (personal relativist morality)
and didn't care what you did.

These three principle philosophies/belief systems all got wrapped up
together into what is primarily the basis for modern "Eastern
philosophy" that you claim I'm bastardizing.

Now, as for this...

I've been studying Wing Chun kung fu on and off for about nine years
now.  I could launch into an equally long (and probably equally dry
:) discussion on why this is just so much movie and not so much
fact. 

Yes, there are reputable reports of this type of training - but it
is _hardly_ representational.  Or linked to the reasons you stated.
Or how anyone could possibly misconstrue starving and beating people
into any way of having them "earn respect", let alone "truly
appreciating the martial arts".

But this is getting even further off-topic and I'm pretty sure most
everyone by now has had enough of my rambling for one day.

(sort of rave related: 4)
uh oh, now i don't think i'll be able to dance for a really long time
(because i hurt my knee skateboarding. i wasn't even doing a really
serious trick like ollieing a car or grinding a handrail (because i
can't!) i should probably stick with downhill skateboarding instead of
street, because i have better luck there with not getting hurt, not to
mention i can only do about 5 tricks =/ ). the doctor told me i tore my
anterior cruciate ligament and probably cartilage. it might have to be
rebuilt. i hope they can do that before family affair + that black nations
records party (damn! i want to go to both!!! well i'm going wherever i can
get a ride to). walking on these crutches sucks + my arms feel so weak, i
don't work out or swim anymore, probably why... walking on crutches
through muddy campgrounds would be a really bizarre experience.

Hello Greta, Kira, Cleveland, and PB-CLE_Raves...

It seems, Greta, that you've found all the record stores you're going to in
CLE, Bent Crayon being the best among them if you are looking for anything
like "rave music" or splinter genres.  But I get the impression that BC just
doesn't wish to be a "rave music" record store -- and hey, much to it's
credit for not selling out.  If it's possible to run a storefront business
and make the rent without selling out, the BC is a role model.  Then again,
being nigh the only recordstore within hours' drive brings to the BC the
responsibility (or so it seems) to deliver to the elec/tech/rave musics to
the area.  Now argue the fine line between "giving the people what they
want" and "going where the money is"  At any rate, the BC is a fine store
for what it is and Mr. Crayon get's all my respect for running it as he
does -- and he gets lots of wax gems in there -- but for the same reason i
don't usually shop there.

But, as with any record store, learning how to find what you're looking for
is the key to coming away with a stack of goot tunes and an afternoon not
wasted.  Usually learning your way around a recordstore is 33% you knowing
what you want, 33% logical organization, 33% simply being in the right kind
of recordstore (there are not less than ten excellent recordstores in the
216 if you're looking for hiphop, rap, soul, r&b, etc. as one might expect
with Cleveland's reputation in that community) and 1% secrecy.  If you
really knew exactly what you wanted to get, and took your list in to the
bent crayon (or went to www.bentcrayon.com) i'm pretty sure they could get a
large percentage of your stuff for you, even if you were looking for new
hard to find underground booty house.  It's just that if you were looking
for new hard to find japanese-only releases of autechre you might just find
it in the bins rather than special order.  BTW, it's rude to special order
and not follow through (purchase).

p.s. 99.9FM

Ferreal - here's my tip on shoes - pick up last years 'cool' style.
Rebok pumps, etc are all good in terms of cushon, and have decent grip.
If you go to the Athelete's foot that's in north hills village, they have
all kinds of last years shoes that are rejected by the kids now for ~$35.

	As far as shoes go, I've never bought any with consideration towards
dancing.  I buy tenners because they're comfortable when I walk and
because they fit and because they possess something that sets those
particular shoes away from the fashion following frenzy.  I've worn
Fluevog boots, Airwalk skateshoes, Simple skateshoes, Converse hightops,
Adidas shelltoes all without discrimination.  I suppose I agree with the
idea that as long as you can cut a rug without cutting the shit out of
your feet, you're okay.  Everyone's feet are different what's good for you
may cripple me for the rest of my life :)  
	I'd like to state that I think the discussion that's been
revolving around shoes and their comfort and dance levels is comparable to
the discussion of which is the better running shoe, basketball shoe,
baseball shoe, etc.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just interesting.  I
will say that when I see a wannabe club kid wear 6" platform/spike heels
to a rave, it makes me raise an eyebrow.  Although I giggle with glee when
I see the same kid kick off her shoes and break out!  (OUCH!)

Love ya,

Also, if you have a ride, you can go about an hour north of Pittsburgh
(via 79) to Grove City.  They have an outlet mall that has TONS of label
stores.  I think they have Hilfiger and Polo and the such.  They
DEFINITELY have Adidas.  I got a pair of shoes for $30 that I've seen
everywhere else for $70!!  Talk about a markdown.  All of their stuff is
cheap like that!  Happy hunting!

i've gone thru x-amount of shoes over the past several years...my
observations:

nike, while usally having the dopest designs, etc.. are shit for quality
and fall apart 6 months after you drop $120 on the new air max ultra hyper
mega's...altho i have a pair of mid priced nike running shoes that have
outlasted all others..*shrug* ...plus, everyone and their dog wears nike
and the shit gets played out and for those of you who know...you can NEVER
wear the same shoes as anyone else, your style has to be the illest :)



adidas: good shoes, yeah big up the trail responses, they look good but
since so many of you kids are wearing them, see above :) also adidas seem
to have pretty narrow  (triangular) toeboxes, so those of us with less than
model quality feet end up getting our toeseses all scrunched up.


asics: i think they are shit, i dont understand their reputation ffor being
such quality running shoes, altho some of their GEL designs are cool.


new balance: my next experiment, i have heard nothing but good about them
they all get good reviews but goddamn some of their models are expensive
like $170 and BUTT UGLY (no the ones im getting tho :)

dancing is rigorous activity (can be anyway) thats why i pass on skate
shoes....i used to wear airwalks back in the day, but anymore its all hi
tech foot gear...if you do alot of crossover steps/footwork, you may want to
get a pair of crosstrainers over running shoes coz runing shoes arent built
for lateral support/strength and the front often gets beat up...id
recommend low top basketball shoes over alot of running shoes even (but
x-trainers are still #1.


ahh the feeling of dancing in really well cushioned cross trainers for the
first time at a good party :)


peace,
hossam

dis is too funny...there's also a Grove City (aka Grove Shity) just south
of Columbus, it's actually the hometown of amy the funky rave goddess
...and if u continue south on 71, u'll hit a series of outlet malls:
everything
from Spiegel to Polo to Levi's...actually it wuz my ex dat introduced me
to da best outlet mall for shoes: Sears Outlet Mall, where i got a pair of
the Nike ACG's original price $100 for $30!...but i do most of my shoe
shopping back in cali where they've got huge Shoe stores w/ super marked
down prices...i got my Addidas hiking shoes out there...orig. price $75
marked down to $40!...plus the selection out there is much more diverse
than anything around here...in addition they get everything about 6 months
before u'll see any of it around here!...

Hardly.  As someone from this list pointed out, the very capitalist nation
of Japan doesn't have the same security problems even in its largest city
that we do here in America.  Anyway, capitalism is more a means of scarce
resource distribution.  Your criticism might be better put in a cultural
context . . . ie it is the low quality of values within our culture,
particularly our poorer economic communities, that is behind the crime
wave.  I doubt economic disparity per se has much to do with it.  Look at
India, for instance -- vast differences between the poor and rich, yet
relatively little crime, at least comparatively.

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!  Halo.........I haven't heard that name since I was performing
live:-)  It's been awhile:)
 
 The reason i was going to try to get in touch with him, is i'm trying to
 do an event this summer.  Not just any event - a great event trying to
 bring back the revolutionary spirit, or at least the fun and energy of
 raves that, sadly I'v felt dwindling for x amount of time.  Plus I'd like
 to see if he'd maybe spin some happy hardcore, if he's still into djing
 it. (which i guess he is given your other message)  Things are coming
 together, and i want to get things confirmed.  The only problem right now
 is i'm not sure exactly what kind of funds I'll have to work with.  Still,
 I'v explored all the aspects i need to get in line, and it seems doable.
 Its going to be cheap, fun and DIY, so...well he should do it!  If you
 think he'd be into it, i'd appriciate relaying the message, or if you
 could give me his number. thanks much.
 
 - doc cutup

He'd probably do it:)  If you want...email me privately and give me your
number.  I wil give it to him and the 2 of you can chat:)

"I'm in favor of the death penalty.  I'm in favor of abortion.  I'm

  What do all these things have in common?  I'm basically in favor 
  of killing."

"It's hard to sleep in a cubicle.  The key is to put your back toward
  the 'door' and face the computer.  Make sure your screen saver
  doesn't activate; if it does, it's a dead giveaway that you're not
  doing anything."

"People wonder why employees at Microsoft work ungodly hours.
  It's not why you think.  If you've got a good mix of the sexes at
  the office, you have about the same odds or better of scoring
  at work as you would at home."

interpret as you will...

<<Was Joey Beltram there?  and if so, what did he spin>>

joey beltram was announced but i couldn't see over all
the heads by the booth...i don't even recall him playing
'energy flash'...i wuz actually more into watching the
break dancing at the time...altho i do recall several
points where the music was so intense, it took over
my body & i busted out a few moves despite the slick
floors...

and since we're on the quotes kick...

from the UNIQUE#2 (1994) interview...

UNIQUE: Do you think the "rave scene" is dying?

JOEY: Here? Yeah definitly! A year ago, there was more
enthusiasm and bigger crowds.  While the enthusiasm
may still be there, there are no numbers. People just
don't seem as interested anymore in that.  I used to do
raves in LA or NY where you'd get like 2,000 easy.  But
now, promotors are happy to get 800 or even less.  That's
a big decline in a year.  If it continues there won't be a
scene for that.  The club scene is stronger, but it's 
different.  It's more house, not really, more progressive.
I think the hardcore music would really suffer.  Some
of these records i hear sound like shit, and they should
just quit making music all together, but people buy it.
I don't know."

yet, 4 years later, the vibe is still alive!

speakin o which lou, where can one get pre-sale tix for 
SPACE near the columbus area?

Perhaps a "vibe" as you put it is "alive", but the parties in general are
a HELL lot different than they were in 94, as they were even more
different in 1992.

I personally think that there is a hell of a lot more negativity and
shadiness today, as well as watered-down music.  This is not to say that
the entire scene is shit, though. 

But it's absolutely nothing like it used to be.

Damn right I'm old school..

hahaha
