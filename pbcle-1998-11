#PB-CLE-RAVES
* * * * * * * * * * * *
This is auto-posted the first of the month.
it was written by doug <doug@visn.net>...  thanks!!!

IRC is an internet based chat system - much more intense than AOL,
Prodigy, Compuserve, etc chat rooms.

There are a number of us who hang out quite regularly on #pb-cle-raves
(EFnet), so if you feel inclinded please stop in to say hi -- or just hang
out there.
DaNcErBot, Moonshine, and Poo-bas are bots, so don't bother talking to
them as they will not talk back -- well maybe sometimes ;)
If you would like to see who is on the channel, then
http://erienet.net/~circle/pb-cle-raves/ will show you.

Make sure your on EFnet... not one of the other IRC networks.
Below I have included some basic IRC information!

HOW DO I GET ON IRC
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

- IRC is way of chatting through the internet, free of aol chatrooms,
hotline, instant messengers, etc.

- IRC is composed of many inter-connected "servers".  The servers exchange
information.   You (as a chatter) need a "client" (program) to connect to
a server.  Many different clients are available, depending on the OS (mac,
*nix, windows) you use.

- Many different IRC clients are available depending on your platform.
For windows, mIRC is pretty much the standard, but pIRCh is my client of
choice.
I like pirch because it has a better GUI (graphical interface) and it is
easier to use.  pIRCh can be downloaded here:
http://www.pirchat.com/
mIRC can be downloaded here:
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/6000/
I don't know about mac, but I believe that IRCle is the program you are
looking for.

-  Now that you know a bit about IRC, you need to understand that there
are different networks.   Dalnet, Efnet, Undernet, IRCnet, etc.   There
are litteraly over a 1000 different IRC servers, but you have to use one
on the network your friends are using.   Efnet is the most popular widely
used network.   There are over 10,000 people connected at one time to over
30 different servers.

-  How do you find a server, you may ask.   This was one of the problems I
had as an IRC newbie.   I have since created a fairly popular webpage that
updates the Efnet server list every four hours.  It can
be found at http://www.erienet.net/~circle/links.html

-  For additional information, you can check out http://www.irchelp.org/
or you can check out the IRC section of my personal web site
http://www.cybrtown.com/~burky

- There were two things that plauged me as a beginning IRC user.   One was
the use of IDENT, and the other was lag.
IDENT.  If you see a message about INSTALL IDENT, that simply means you
need to enable that feature in your pirch or mirc client.   Its a way of
the server to determine the "name" of your computer.   It is in you best
interest to make your IDENT something obscure.
LAG.   With a network such as Efnet, it takes awhile for information to
get from here to there.   Usually the lag is around 2 seconds.   However,
servers do have problems, and tend to split or get lagged.  You can PING
another user to determine your lag.  If you join a channel and don't see
what your expecting, then the server you are using is probably "split".  A
split is a seperation from the rest of the network.

ok, here it is...well my abnormalities work for me actually. i don't
need as much sleep now, i get more things done. i like to put a
positive twist on this study. yes, i do get a little depressed
sometimes, but it goes away, am happier at the same time...i grow
stronger..i am sorry that is just me. i really havent done that much
over the past 6 years of "raving" but they said even 1 can cause
damage...ok i can't change the past so i must work on the
future...love red

hi guys, bagiNa is one sad girl right now.
  i wasn't able to go to magick, cause of sooooo many reasons, i guess i
wasn't meant to go.
my friend jason spilled paint all over him at work, therefore he had to
stay till 10 and didn't get home till 10:30, my uncle joe died, my car
door isn't on, cause some ass tried to get into the key hole thing a
feew days ago, and jason's mom still wouldn't let him out anyway.
      THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i've been planning to go to it since Phorm...DAMNIT!!!
 well, i hope you guys all had a great time, i'm sure you did and i
hhhope the net meet went well, and everyone knows everyone better
now...it would have been sooo nice to be there.  my mom even bought
brreakfast food for me &friends today, oh well, i'm going to MXPX
tuesday, i hope those plans fall through.i can't wait, but it won't be
anythihng like magick.
             see you all again sometime, hopefully
                     love, giNa

E  M U S I C    Columbus, OH

Hmm where do I start....

First of all I would like to say that there were some really great people
out last night, and from all points on the map....which I find to be very
fun and cool. There were some cute costumes.....the usual...dracula,
tinkerbells...ect ect.

All the music was super good...WOW!! It seemed like everyone ( the dj's )
had practiced hardcore for like the whole week and really got some crazy
shit together. Im usually not a jungle person, but last night...YiKes!!
Anyone remember who masturbeat battled? Some dude from jersey..... WoW!!
Doughboy was probably my favorite set of the night...next to Brenden.
Brenden is super good...watch out for this kid..I have a feeling he will be
at a party near you soon. .."commin' from the eastcoast", but repazentin
Columbus ofcourse. So anyhow Rob Rage comes on....it's about 4:00. You know
what I lied...this guy had my favorite set of the night, UNTIL THE PARTY GOT
CLOSED DOWN!! UgHHhH!! I was so pissed off. Can you believe it...the party
got closed down at about 4:30am, due to noise disturbance.  hehe I can
believe it....I was next to the right speaker...I thought forsure my one
eardrum busted...I heard it pop. Ears are still kinda buzzin....I'll be
paying for that in 30 years when I can't hear shit.  The one thing I hated
about the whole night was that someone I like and respect got eliminated
from the battle (sense- vs- joe blunt).....I think he was pretty upset about
this. Battles......what the hell are they for anyway?

My ride left me, but luckily I had my girl Lindsay there. She watches out
for me. It's strange.....sometimes when I feel like I don't have anyone, I
guess I just never realized that I do have people out there that care for me
like Im family. You know I think that's what got me into this whole "raving"
mess....people just loving you because they just do. . .so then we snuggled
on the way to Walts house for afterhours. I probably wasn't there longer
than an hour. I think Phatom 45 was playing....came home and now here I am.
Drinking a Sam Adams at 10am like a lush...

So who the hell won last night anyways? I think they had to flip for the
12's since it got shut down...

I hope everyone had a good time last night, and MADE IT HOME SAFELY!! Can't
wait to read the reviews...hurry up and send them already!!

Love, Amy

i  can see how this is possible, but i dont think its permanent.  every
experience ive had with e is great, but a few days later i get really
depressed and lazy, but just for a day.. hence my theory.

alllllllllll massive:

yup. i had a darn good time @ magick.

music: lemon lyman (pb-cle reprazent) tore shit up right from the very
beginning, displaying some serious mixing skills and nice nice
selection. he got everybody who came to DANCE from the very beginning
movin and groovin. next was tim zelch... i'm not a big tim zelch fan,
but he seemed to rock it as well. both of these acts were in the lobby
(cause they were still setting up the arena). when the arena opened,
im not exctly sure who was spinnin, but he kicked major ass. i don't
even know what style he spun to tell you the truth, but it was wikked.
up next: dr. trance. if you missed dr. trance, you missed out big
time! he looked like he was at least 50 years old, and was wearing
this crrrazy suit. as he mixed track after track he hyped up the crowd
by doing all sorts of wacky gestures + stuff... he really knew his
shit, singing along and gettin everyone moooovin. his selection was on
the harder, faster side of the trance spectrum (at times it sounded a
bit trancecore/happy hardcore influenced... guess that makes sense
cause he's from toronto). he was by far my favorite of the nite. up
next (the last guy i got to see) was felix the housecat. he tore shit
up as well, spinning (believeitornot) HOUSE! a couple of classics, a
lot of minimal dancefloor trax, a bit of plastikman (mixed w/ plenty
of tricks to keep it interesting).

netmeet: as soon as i showed up (2:00) kelly got on the mix and old
everyone to go intot he main arena for the "unmasking"... i dont know
if i missed it or what, but i just ended up staying for felix :)

informal netmeet: jbrick/trouty/r@tfink headed up to the front of the
main dancefloor with a {pb-cle} sign and we represented like that :)

space: the paintball arena/lobby on top of metropol. i have never been
there before, so that was cool. i showed up early to help set up, and
we hauled woodchips for several hours, making the space as clean as we
could in the amount of time we had (big up the dirt shoveling/bucket
hauling massive). all the props in the arena (barrels, obstacles, etc)
were covered in some REALLY FUNKY sticky shit, which many peoplpe had
the misfortune of leaning against and gettin all nasty (it was kinda
funny to see peoples' reactions, tho >:)

vibe: generally good. a little distressed cause of the slime, also i
heard a lot of people sayin "fuck this... it's ALL HOUSE" <--- no shit
it's all house! the costumes and stuff realy added to the vibe and
made it FUN FUN FUN.

dorky shit: andythepooh.com got the realaudio broadcast workin and
sounding great. big up andy/don + andythepooh.com's quest for world
domination.

that's it. hope you all had as much fun as meeee :)

GO SCIENCE.  i think it is permanent.  i think a percentage of the
seratonin terminals created during the drug's execution remain after MDMA
is completely metabolized (if it is completely metabolized).

the X's represent serotonin molecules in your "brain".  the Y's represent
the amount of serotonin required based of the number of terminals. 
(terminals created to manfacture the serotonin that was introduced by the
drug use).  and there you have it..how pretty?  but how  do you quantify
the number of TERMINALS in someone's head?

this is one of the better explanations i have seen... just because the
level of serotonin may be lower... it doesnt mean the brain needs its
previous levels... my question is, what aBout kids who only try it
maybe 10 or so times?

What dictates the level of serotonin needed is the amount of
sero-terminals.  After the drug has been metabolized completely, your body
manufatures the normal value it did before first MDMA use.  There is a
resultant neurotransmitter deficit because extra terminals were created to
satisfy the drug's effect.  On multiple use, I think more terminals are
created just as they were in the process below, however, due to the
deficit created by the first use, possibly more drug is needed to reach
desired effect.  Also, keep in mind that your diet mediates levels of
important (they all are) neurotrasnmitters in the brain.  Carbohydrates
promote increased serotonin production, not as substantial as MDMA of
course.  We don't see people licking each other after they get fries from
Wendy's.  Proteins inhibit the production of serotonin.  They fight.  The
total available serotonin for the brain then depends on the ratio of
carbohydrates to proteins.  If carbohydrates win, you have a greater
serotonin level.  If you eat no protein, all carbohydrates, serotonin has
a field day.  So, if you eat carbohydrates all day and then do E, you'll
get real fucked up, have a greater deficit, and disrupt the shit out
yoself.  All of this information is available to the public. But the last
part about carbohydrates and MDMA is my hypothesis.

Allright, here goes:

Prerave:
I arrived at 6:30 to help clean up . . . and buy was some clean up
needed.  For those that weren't there then, the ground was COVERED in
about 2 inches of that sawdust/dirtly old paintballs/dirt that was in
piles all over the place.  My first thoughts were: There's no way this
is going to get done in time or that the police will let us have a
party here.  But Don (not wizard workshop Don), david schwanke, me and
a bunch of other people proved me wrong.  We cleared just about the
entire thing.  It was ubsurd.  We'd fill big ass trash cans up with
that shit, then haul them (which wieghed a TON) to the back of the
room and dump them in a big pile.  Some of it ended up just being
pushed to the sides and under obstacles tho.  I heard of no problems
with cops or people smoking in that room either.  The main room didn't
open up till about 11:00 or 11:30, but the lobby started icking at
like 9:00.

Rave:
Well, like frankie g said, Lemon Lyman tore it up.  I was tired as
hell from doing all that shoveling, but I had to dance for a a good
bit of his set it was so good.  People started arriving, and
throughout the night I heard stories of lines wrapping around the
block.  Next time listen when they say arrive early :) Tim Zelch did
do a pretty good job.  def. better than I remember him in the past. 
Then the main room started kickin.  charles Masters tore it up with
some good shit . . . I dont' even know what it would be called, but it
rocked.  then Dr. Trance . . . OH GOSH!  He brought the roof down!  My
favorite part about his set was when there would be a huge build up
and right as the song would break he would toss a huge handful of
candy out!  His other gestures behind the decks were great.  The set
up in the main room was great too.  Two dancefloor, four sets of
speakers, lots of lights, pimped out green laser, large projecttion
screen courtesy of Usei (spelling?) and his crew . . . who could ask
for anything more?  Felix da housecat came up next, and he started off
sounding kinda slow so I was a little worried, but within one minute,
I realized it was ALL GOOD.  Never heard anythign quite like his style
before, but it was great.  I tried to go to the net meet at 2:00 by
the tables, but there were only a few people there, and I was missing
either dr. trance or felix da housecat and I didn't want to be doing
that, so I went back in thinking I would come back, but I didn't. 
Sorry all.  My favorite net meet of all time was up front at phorm . .
. and that's where I think it should be as far as I'm concerned.  That
way nobody misses the music . . . whatever.  Oh yeah . . . also BIG
BIG UP the MC Kelly in the place!  Forreal, the crowd loved it
everytime you got on the mic and said something like, "is everybody
having a good time?!"  The first couple of times I was afraid you were
going to say something like, "Sorry, people the cops are shutting it
down . . . " or along those lines and that made it all the much better
when you were actaully just encrouaging people to party :)

Postrave:
Well I left at about 3:45 and at that point the place was COMPLETELY
packed.  I mean people were all over the main arena and the lobby.  It
was hard as hell to find anybody you knew.  As i was waiting outside I
saw some people get turned down from going in . . . I would assume
cause it was full capacity.  I have NO idea who downlow is going to
get all that sawdust crap back over the floor . . . but whatever.  I
asked kelly what was up with that and she said, "I don't know!  It
doesn't matter!  I'll PAY somebody to do it!" in a very happy way :)

That's about it . . . mad probs to downlow for a slammin' time.  

favorite quote of the night by sean (i think that's his name) of
tr-generationg while dancing his ass off to either dr. trance or
felix: THIS IS MY TEMPLE!

I'm in such a daze its not even funny!...
Wasn't planning to go, but I ended up going (alot because of Downlow's
*awesome* generosity at giving us kids a discount)...and it was a very
very fun ting....the space and the fact that *alot* of people dressed up
made it for me...i wish people would dress up that much for *every* rave 

(although my suggestion is to keep the face-paint minimal :)

Dr Trance was the set of the night for me (although i missed lemon because
i was in line)...felix started out kinda sloppy, but he won me over
eventually...ah...too tired to rehash the whole thing.  i was fun.

MAJOR props to downlow for doing it really
well! :) Now if you only have a hardcore room at your next one.... :)
Shouts to all pb-cle kids i met...alot of you OH kids for the first
time...steve/shadedesigns + crew for making that hour long line only seem
like 50 mins... ;P

l8rs,

That's my jam - really!!!  
"Sex Dwarf"  (or sex dorf if you have a fetish for tim conway)
by Soft Cell.

Recently the electro-industrial band Laeatherstrip did a decent cover of
this tune, but i don't think its quite up to the original (although
there's quite a few decent "Tainted Love" covers).

>Brain scans of 14 men and women who used the party drug show it damages the
>nerves that release serotonin, the chemical believed to play a role in mood,

the
>study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a British medical
>journal.

>And although some of the participants had not taken the drug for several

>Ecstasy, a hybrid of the hallucinogen mescaline and the stimulant amphetamine
>chemically known as MDMA, has been shown in previous studies to cause brain
>damage in animals at doses similar to those used by humans.
>
>In humans, tests have shown reduced levels of a serotonin byproduct,

researchers

>
>``But this is the first time we've been able to examine the actual serotonin-
>producing nerve cells directly in the brain,'' said Dr. George Ricaurte, the
>neurologist who led the study.

>It is difficult to measure how widely Ecstasy is used because it is illegal.
>However, a survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found a four-fold
>increase between 1995 and 1996 in the number of Americans reporting they use

>
>Users report heightened communication skills, a sense of closeness with
others
>and increased emotional awareness.
>
>In comparison with the 15 people studied who had never taken the drug,
Ecstasy
>users had fewer serotonin transporters -- proteins embedded in the membranes
>of nerve endings that transmit nerve signals from one cell to another.
>
>Those lower levels suggest the drug destroys the nerve endings in the brain,
>Ricaurte said.
>
>``We've had lots of indirect evidence, but this goes right to the heart of

>Ricaurte said scientists do not know how many transporters the human brain
can

>anxiety, memory disturbance, sleep abnormalities or other troubles start to
>occur.

>Ricaurte also said it is too early to tell whether the damage is permanent.

>But Jim O'Callaghan, a neurotoxicologist at the Centers for Disease Control
>and Prevention in Atlanta, was not impressed by the study.

>He does not dispute that the drug causes a reduction in the number of

reviews + why today sucks:

darkside 6
^^^^^^^^^^
the space was this small renovated warehouse type building, very
clean, even after the party. =] in the front room/hallway was the
experimental noise music, but i don't really get into that (it's not
structured enough for me) so i can't say much about it. there was a
hallway into the main room with strobes + a LED sign programmed to
present the philosopy behind the event, having to do with the balance
between chaos + order. perfect stripped-down elemental style lighting.
also in the main room there was a video projection of some cool
abstract stuff on the wall. the sound system was small but loud +
clear sounding although a little too much high end maybe. total
attendance seemed to be in the area of 150. devilgirl spun some REALLY
hard techno, i was very impressed with her selection + mixing both. i
was hanging out outside when bambule commando was on. i was equally
impressed with fishead's set. he was beat-juggling hardcore + just
busting out mad tricks all over at incredible speed. fanon flowers
played hard techno/house, very solid mixing + he was totally rocking
the dancefloor. then powerhouse went on with more hard techno + his
selection was pretty good + he was doing a lot of unusual tricks but
they were more often off than on, so that was a problem. then lunar
stepped up to the other 2 turntables set up + added some ambient to
powerhouse's set, which was a unique idea. afterwards he continued
with more downtempo material to finish off the event.

majick
^^^^^^
we ended up getting there sort of late, around 1 + there was a long
line but it moved pretty fast. the front room was very hot + crowded.
the lighting in that room was terrible, since every light seemed to be
at eye level and aimed straight across the room so i was blinded
anytime i tried to look anywhere but down. it took me about 1/2 hr of
stepping over people to locate the main room, which was cold + not
overly crowded, and had this slimy stuff (paint???) on every surface
except the floor which was dirt (weird). much better--and
elaborate--lighting in that room, + and a great sound system. i
couldn't tell who was spinning at any time anywhere. every DJ seemed
to be spinning trance, hard trance, + hard house, which is cool, but
not really my thing. nothing stood out as particularly good or bad
though. did anybody actually use those portapotties? i hope you
didn't. there were bathrooms in the space in the hallway behind the
tables in the front room. it looked pretty clean + unused. attendance:
about 1500-2000.

why today sucks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
at majick i was running around in total darkness when i ran right into
this metal wall since i couldn't see where i was going + smashed my
kneecap + both shins into it as i went headfirst over it. (smooth move
huh?)

i felt sick + fucked up when i was there even though i didn't take
anything, + fell asleep for an hr.

we missed our turnpike exit + got lost in nw PA.

i got a $130 speeding ticket ~100 yds before the exit where i would
have slowed down + not got the ticket.

we were supposed to go to an afterhours + it ended up being a few
people hanging out in this guy's basement watching tv + me sleeping on
the floor.

aforementioned "afterhours" took about 1/2 hr of turning around +
driving in circles to find since they wouldn't give us proper
directions.

my friend accidentally locked my keys in my car (but i got them out
since i discovered how to open the broken lock from the outside).

i'm hung over + i lost a contact lens.

i had to figure out how to manually shift an automatic transmission in
the dark while the lights on the gearshift are broken, while 1/2 drunk
on a bunch of st ides special brews, since i think my car's
transmission is dying.

simultaneously very happy and very pissed off,
-elias

well, since you guys have taken yer turns, it's mine.

let's start with friday.

i was busy all fucking day. from 8 til 5 or so, trying to figure out how
the fuck to keep going once this contract is over if i cant find a job or
get my next business started. which turned into a migraine around 10a.

i go to listen to interFACE like i usually do, finally, and whats the pc
do? its fucked up. cant get it to boot correctly half the time, much less
get realplayer working. so there goes interFACE. well FUCK ME, huh?

oh, but it gets worse...

saturday, i spend till about 2 working on my pc, still can't get it
working. finally gave up for a while, and took a nap. woke up, and thought
about magick.

then i finally decided... 

i was gonna go to magick. maybe it'd cheer me up. even busted out my
wolfman stuff. :P

'cept for one problem that stood in my way. got in car, got ready to
leave, and it no start. spent most of the night working on it. didn't get
it working till *late*, too late to make magick at all.

so what do i do? what any good weirdo does. heads up to the local rpg
shop. yay. ran into a few of my friends there, and we ended up going down
to norwalk. to gore orphanage. 

i wont bother going into detail, but lets just say some *truly* weird and
scary shit happened down there for real, resulting in us getting totally
lost, and driving around for 2 hours till we finally found our way OUT of
there.

so i finally get back around 5, pass out in bed from exhaustion.

wake up today around noon. pc is still mucho fucked. spend all fucking day
fighting with it, soldering, yanking cards and cables, cutting up my hands
something awful on the case, getting yet another migraine... and the
result? well, it works a bit. but half the shit is broken. no sound, no
scsi, no ethernet, modem likes to screw up.. *sigh* all cuz of this damned
motherboard being such a piece of shit.

oh, don't worry, i've already found out what im going to be doing tomorrow
that is garaunteed to make it suck. same damned thing i was doing friday. 

would somebody please shoot me? *sigh*

Should have gotten to this a bit earlier, as I knew it was going to be
big.  Waiting in line for about 2 hours and finally got in a bit after the
net-meet was supposed to happen. :(

Nevertheless, I heard a kicking but hardish set by Felix Da Housecat
(E-Mouse) who played among other tunes that bob sinclair Gym Tonix track
and this kicking song which sampled that Bon Jovi Living on a prayer.
This was about all the time I spent in the main room.  The lights and
visuals were great, sound pumping but It lacked the vibe of the smaller
parties I have been getting used to.

Moved to the first room, which while very crowded had awesome sound, and
the decks were right on a pool table at dancer level so you could really
see what the DJ was doing and be a part of it all, moreso than any of the
parties/club nights I have been to recently.

The first set Iheard in the first room was some ghetto booty house
sounding stuff that didn't get me really going.  But like i said the vibe
was tight there.

Kevin then came on and played some really nice funky stuff and had me and
my girlfriend who usually doesnt go to raves, dancing and busting loose
all over the place.  I think I will change my mind about not going to
Zythos. :-)

The big suprise for me of the evening was Nauty Groove.  he spun and
the most fabulous mix of housey tracey get down on the floor and dance.
It was great to see him so up close as you could tell he was having a good
time and the Scrub Bubble plastic squeez toy attached to his headphones
just cracked me up!  I asked him durin an idle period who he was and he
handed me a mixtape. Yummi! He had me "Horny All Night Long"

Left about 8AM, great party!

Props out to listers including rat fink who brought a sign which i danced
with for awhile.  There was some jackass note written on the back from
that cox kid who I know yinz are jealous n'at for not going to his own
party.  But i digress......
 
Word up to the WWS sound crew.

Thanks to Circut 6, and DSchwanke for cleaning up beforehand, the main
room while lacking vibe did seem very cleen.
 
Congrats to http://www.andythepooh.com on his virgin broadcast!

Cutup and Robokitty who didn't shirk from doing the Helloween thing 2
nights in a row.

Sean from TR Generation, who isn't even on the list but is always friendly
and is just packed with enthuasism.

Xspyboy, Troutee (The Mailman!), Icarus aka Geeky and Jen and Steve from
(c)Akron. ;-)

Also nice seeing so many Cleveland Kids in there as well!

most of all big thanks to kelly and rich for keeping things real and safe,
and I did see some hairy stuff going on outside. damn drunks

pLuR,

I haven't had this much fun at a party since Phorm!  Finally, I got to
hear a whole night's worth of awesome trance and house (for those of
you who hate this music, well, I've put up with your jungle shit for
long enough :-)

Dr. Trance was the highlight of my night, although the two guys that
went after him, Felix da Housecat and Chris Drop had me dancing like
crazy as well.  (Seemed like everyone was dancing -- a good thing to
see.)  The 'Living on a Prayer' wa-wa sound mix kicked ass.    More
dj's should try to work Bon Jovi into their sets.

I only met about three or four new people from the list, since I was
only at the netmeet for about five minutes (the front room was too hot
for me; I stayed out of it most of the night.)

Aside from throwing up once, I felt great -- which was a pretty major
thing because lately I've been so prone to this kind of 'I'm so
overheated and my stomach feels like shit and I haven't even danced at
all' thing.  

Shouts out to Doc Cutups, who I got to meet for the first time; also
to Kay, and Di (and a couple people whose names I can't recall.)  Of
course, it's always a pleasure seeing those of you I already know and
love to see!  (Hey, Frankie g -- where were you all night?)

I even stayed for a bit of the 'after-party' -- my very first one.

:-)
Amanda

AARRRRRGGGGHHHH! because of some last minute complications, I was not able to attend Magick*sob*
I read all the reviews when I got home from my little
trip and I must say I am REALLY REALLY REALLY upset 
that I could not go. I feel like I have a big cut in
my back and everytime I read a magick review its like
someone is pouring salt into it and stomping it down 
with combat boots. I know some of you thought i really
did go as the invisible man, but alas, i just could'nt 
go. Oh, well, life goes on. C-YA at da next one!

Halloween was the best!  I had a great time giving out candy to the 
kids, freaking out neighbors, giving out goodies to the nice Borough 
people who helped watched the kids, and MAGICK was the best!

Lotsa good costumes, Hi Mr. Googie Monster!  (if ya seen the big green 
boogley eyed monster, you know who I mean!)  Lots and Lots and Lots
of people, and the music was great!

Thanks Rich and Kelly for putting on the biggest party I have ever seen!  
It was amazing!

Peace out,
K.

Well, It was a pretty decent party.  I had a pretty good time, and was worth
the trip to Pitts from Cleveland, except I totaly dislike Pittsburg!!!  I was
lost for about 2 hours in Downtown.  Well, atleast I memorized Grant St., Wood
St., 6th St, Liberty St, and a few others, so now I know where to go if I ever
go to Pitts again.  Lets just say I will never drive there again.  The Party;
the line kinda sucked, but it was worth the wait, good vibe, great music,  Dr.
Trance was awesome, and so was Zelch.  Also Cris Drum rocked!!!  I picked up a
tape from Naughty and it is interesting.  Trancy, HipHop kinda stuff...cant
explain it, it is pretty sweet though.  The venue was ok.  It was better than
Bents.  I came home caked in dirt, or something, but atleast it was not oil,
and greasy grime!  The Netmeet worked out pretty well.  Glad I got to meet
some new people.  Also thanks to all of you who helped me look for my wallet.
I totaly appreciate it!!  I do have to say one thing...I am SOOOOO sorry about
something I said to those people!  I was sooo worried because I had all my
money in there, which was for a hotel room, and I was affraid somebody would
take it.  Sorry I didnt trust you guys!  I felt like total shit like right
after I said not to take my money.  It just came out soo wrong.   

Shouts go out to Matt, and Benny.  Thanks for the bottle, and the sign!  I am
proud to admit, I was the first to get it!! YIPPY!!!  Braden and Heather.
Glad I got to see the both of you there!  Amanda and Eric, its always a
pleasure to see you guys!  Spike, I told you I would rememember! Di, glad you
liked my back rub...watch out for her purrrr!!!!!! Neki (I think), which by
the way we got along sooo good!  I could have sworn we known eachother for out
entire lives!!!, Trout, Andy, and the few others I forgot to name, it was
great meeting you guys.  And of course Jenn, Mark...which by the way had a
GREAT costume, Amy, Steve and I think thats it.  For the People I missed: If
you remember me, please E-Mail me so I can get a list of all the people I have
met.

Sorry I didnt get to meet Kelly, or Rich, but I heard about you guys, so
perhaps next time.  Also Mad props to Kelly for making my Holloween the best
yet.  

Well....I am still tired, so if I remember anything else I will post. 

PLUR
Hugh

Well, I'm glad everyone had fun at Majick.
I hope y'all got good and slimy.

I left for the barn/Grow/Assimilation
Saturday nite, 7:00 or so.
Didn't get there till 10:00 or so,
(had to stop at Wal-Mart too)

Well, I hung out for most of the night in my car,
which is actually a common occurrence
(it's a mini-rave in there.)
Grow was completely different from Phat Free.
Not enough people, I mean ravers.
There were too many backwoods slack-jawed
yokels.  They charged 2 bucks admission.
What the fuck???  Free party?  Guess not.
Beer in a styrofoam cup for a dollar?
No one was dancing, I probably would not have 
gotten to spin.  We left early.
Damn.

The only cool parts were meeting Kerri
and seeing Ken (Huba jube) spin.
And DJ Hustle, who is really good jump-up.
Sorry for making him give up those sweet ass
headphones, and for missing his set.

Arggh...
It was so fun last time.
There's so much potential for that place.

Oh, I WILL be sending tapes NOW.
Sorry for not having them completed 
by Saturday night.  I had a hectic
weekend.

Hi guys, it must have been a good party at Magick, since it took a lot of you
including myself a couple of days to sober up and see our keyboard to make a
review.  I got to the party late about 10:30 pm for me that is late because i
really wanted to give kelly and don from wizard workshop a hand, but i was
busy printing all day sat. in preparation for the party.  i couldn't find the
space at first but then i just followed the line from my car.  i am bad with
the D.J.s but i really liked the music out of the lobby, but it was just too
hot to dance there.  i found my way to the back room, and boy what a
difference in atmosphere, cool and a lot of room to dance. i know we had a
large turn out from the pb-cle raves, but the net meet was not as organized as
i would have hoped.  so far as some complaints about being so dark i loved it,
my costume had that much more impact.  i am glad i got to meet a lot of you
guys for the first time, this time i brought a ton of laminates, but either
you already had one or i didn't get a chance to hook up with you.  i
appreciate a lot of you guys checking up on me, but i have been twice as
whacked out as i was at magick and still be able to talk to a cop with a
straight face.  the night went so fast, every where i went you kids wanted me
to dance for you. needless to say i felt like a zombie by after hours. maybe i
was in the wrong room but did anyone spin any jungle. there might of been
someone but i was just dancing to everything.  i am glad that everyone got
into the spirit of things and wore a costume.  thumbs up to kelly and rich for
pulling off another phat party.  thanks to don from wizard workshop for
keeping the sound crisp. and andy the pooh, who broad cast the music over the
internet, for those that wished they could be there.  i hope any problems that
downlow might have had won't prevent them from having another party. again i
had a blast, i might go as stick man to the next party halloween or not.  see
yall soon ...peace O+< mark
ps if you want a laminate and or a sticker please send your request along with
a stamped self addressed envelope to :

I guess Majick has been reviewed by a several people already, so I thought
I'd just add a couple things... My really really liked Pat Egan and
Kevin's sets in the small room.. of course I also Dr. Trance's set in the
main room :)

The discount for listmembers was quite respectable..

I didn't have time to think about a costume until about ten minutes before
I left for Magick. I'm still in the process of settling in to my new home
here in Pittsburgh and my apartment was utterly devoid of any
costume-making materials, and my big black wooly cloak was 2000 miles
away, so the only thing I had resembling a costume was a couple pairs of
flannel pajamas.. So I thought to myself, what the hell, I've always
wanted to go to a party in PJs anyway, and so this would be a good
excuse.. OK, dancing in comfy flannel PJs is the best thing in the world.
yeah, phat pants are comfy, but they're nothing compared to flannel PJs..
I just wish I could were them to more parties... The only problem is that
the pockets were flimsy, so my keys would fall out when I danced, so I had
to hold them in my hand the whole night....

Well, the part I didn't like was no free water. I guess I'm pretty cheap,
but I'm also not exactly rich.. I sweat a whole lot and it keeps a lot of
water to keep me hydrated, and I only brought $5 extra with me to the
party (no PJ pockets=no wallet), so after I spent all my money on water at
$1.50 a bottle, I got pretty dehydrated dancing in that hot hot room.. The
guys at the door said they wouldn't let me leave and come back in,
otherwise I would have gone to get some more money and some gatorade.. So
after a while of dancing while being extremely thirsty, I got pretty sad,
cause I was just too thirsty to dance anymore without passing out, so I
took a break, and spent the rest of the night kind of just bouncing
around...  A twenty-five dollar party should have free water. All parties
should have free water. Its a small point I guess, but I would have had a
lot more fun if they either had free water or they had let me go out to
get more money.. I also wanted to buy one of those red reflector things
with the flashing LED's, but that cost $7, and I had already blown my
meager funds on water... Maybe there was free water somewhere in that
place, but I couldn't find it..

I liked that area behind the DJ stage in the main room.

I didn't care for the wood chips and the still-live paintballs on the
perimeter. I think place would have been more aestheticlly pleasing (I'm
talking rave aesthetics here) if the paintball decor was covered up by
black plastic or something. silver plastic even. I don't mind getting
dirty in a warehouse space, but that wood mulch was pretty gross. It must
have been hard for the downlow crew to get the place as clean as it was, I
can't imagine all the paint mess that would usually be on the floors...

anyway, this was my first rave in Pittsburgh. I made the mistake of
mentioning that this would be my first "party" in pittsburgh to someone
while standing in line to get in, and he quickly corrected me. no, this is
a _rave_, it goes until _ten_am_, it will rock your world :)

I picked up a couple flyers for parties that seemed like they would be
pretty good. One was a charity event called "Love of Life". Unfortunately,
I promptly lost this flyer. The other one was a flyer for a party called
believe, on 11/20 in pittsburgh. 

anyway, just some thoughts I had.. I really wanted to go to a house party
friday night, but I was busy until 1am that night... sigh.

As far as I'm concerned the magick space was nearly perfect.  only two
problems:
1) it was a bitch to clean (both before and I'm sure after)
2) people got hurt on jutting out things (but this could have been
easily solved with some glow in the dark/reflective tape)

As far as people complaining they got dirty, sorry, but I say, "deal
with it."  to me part of the fun of raves are not knowing what's going
to go down.  Getting a little dirty just may be the price you have to
pay for a little excitement.  although I do think that the bathrooms
should have been accesible so that people could wash their hands/faces.

later,

That would be me.
Um, hi. :)

I'm a gothic/industrial DJ/concert promoter, and I got so excited by
Kevin's set that I tried to book him to spin on goth/industrial night at
Laga. It's probably a good thing that he said he's too busy with Zythos,
'cause in retrospect, I must've gotten a little carried away to think that
he'd go over over at a goth club.  :)

Watching him tweak those knobs was something to see.

My roommate's dog has one of those squeeze toys, so I screamed when I saw
it on Naughti's ear and he looked up and grinned at me.

I didn't mind the dirt as much as I minded the darkness. I expect to get
dirty at parties. I don't expect to run into large metal objects...
The first time I walked into the main room i found myself tangled up in this
netlike stuff that was hanging from the ceiling. I'm sure, if anyone could
see me, that I looked like a total fool... Good thing I was sober then. The
main room was hell for people on drugs.
It seemed like I spent half the night looking for people. I just couldn't
see at all.
But the music and the vibe totally made up for that. It was a tight party
and I'm glad I went. I had a really good time. Thanks to all who made it so
cool!
I don't know who posted this earlier, but my favorite net meet of all time
(also my first)  was up front at Phorm, too. I think we should have them up
front in the future. If you want to talk with someone, you can always leave
the dancefloor. I don't like having to leave the dancefloor at 2Am for a
netmeet, cuz that's usually the peak of the night. I love dancin' with you
guys... Please ?
Love,
Amber

Nope. :(  She was workin' all late...and she doesn't wanna pay $20
...and a million other complex reasons.  But she wasn't there.

She might be motivated to go to DAWN though...

It was cool to see you there....i hate it when an event is strickly
'ravers'... :)

i'm personally in favor of the on the floor net-meet, but i came up
with a pretty good solution... 2 different netmeets!

one on the floor @ 1:30 or so
one by the bathroom (or wherever) @ 2:30 or so.

you could go to one or both or none.

i really dont see why it isn't in front of the dj booth
all-night-long, tho :)

...frankie g

ps - as sure as the sun rises in the east... it also sets in the west

Hey all,
Due to extenuating physical circumstances from dancing WAY too much at
Atomic on thursday (nice meeting ya Schwanke), I missed magick.  I knew
if went I would freak my bones just a bit too much and end up hurting
myself (this ever happen too anyone else?).  My joints are still
throbbin from throwin my groove down on thursday.  I guess that'll teach
me to ration the funk.
Anyway, I'm lookin' to build my record collection (as if it needed it) a
bit more and I was wondering if y'all had any recomendations on good
JAZZY/INTELIGENT jungle.
Thanks much for the info.

well, it depends on what format youre looking for. if you want cd's ,the
logical progression series, promised land series, and platinum breaks 1 by
the metalheads all contain a good amount of jazzy/intelligent jungle. on
12", good looking, looking good, 720(degrees), metalheadz, moving shadow,
and the fomation family of labels all contain some, if not all, jazzy and
intellignt.

I agree! Even now that the GAP has adopted some elements of so-called
'raver style I seriously don't believe in one rigid definition of dress.
As long as people are dancing and into the music its all good.

I was going through the archive and pulled this from a review of the
Carnegie Science Center Rave in 1995.

I went to my first party in '92 and had NO idea of a sense of dress. (and
some would argue I still don't ;) )  The concept that you have to wear so
and so label is ridicululous and not inline with the pLuR ideal.  Not that
I have anything against Phat Pants n'at. ;)

I think thats what makes net-ravers and net-meets so much fun, the

Well, I guess it's ok to review your own party. I'm going to anyway.
It might be interesting to those of you who didn't get to see the behind
the scenes stuff (unlike Frankie & Todd, kiss kiss, you guys were
super!).

The day started at 7am for me.  Moving in Port-O-Johns etc. etc.  Calls
to the owner of Paintball Sports Arena (Julian {makes me wish I was 20
years older, what a cool guy}) from the landlord (oh no, I'm losing my
space, I thought).  Moving in lights and sound, the usual stuff.  No big
deal.  However, I was concerned about the landlord.  His son ended up
easing his mind about the party (thanks SteveFord!).

The info. line had been getting a crazy amount of phone calls over the
last few weeks.  One day over 100 people called.  Normally it's like 10
or so right before a party.  So we knew we were going to have a good
turn out.  But seeing those people winding around Smallman and down Penn
Ave. blew me away.  Wow.  It looked like Philly or New York.  I did a
little survey of those waiting, asking who there went to parties
regularly.  About half said they did.  Interesting.  Halloween was
definitely on our side.  And getting new people to fun parties will
ensure the future of the scene.  So, Magick was definitely good for that
reason too.

Aside from one person setting off the alarm early in the evening (calls
cops, fire, and landlord),  a few random smokers outside of the smoking
room, and someone keying AndyThePooh's car {any info appreciated,
although it was most likely someone from one of the bars}, we had no
problems.  There were a couple of tags that I spent this morning
scrubbing off of the air-hockey table.  Everyone seemed to have a
blast.  That's my greatest reward.  To see promoters and DJs dancing and
sweating at 7am does it for me.  To see all the old-skool people hanging
out (Opus, Dori {my guest list girl}, Kira where were you??) and all of
you guys, of course.

Musically I'd have to say that Dr Trance and Felix did it for me.  Kevin
is our baby and everyone knows how we feel about his DJing. Nauti Groove
blew me away in Ohio a month ago so I knew he would please everyone.  I
loved Dave Breakwell's booty...I mean booty house (woops, caught me).
In general the music was great.  Roy Davis was a no show :(  I just got
off the phone with his agent and this was the first party he's ever
missed.  He has the flu).  OSheen's plane had trouble and his flight for
the after-hours was cancelled.  Sorry for everyone who was counting on
Roy and OSheen.

Everyone has been thanking me for the great time.  Magick proves to me
that the impossible is possible.  Pittsburgh really has a great scene,
and sooooooooo much potential.  It's not about one promotion co. vs.
another.  One party feeds onto the next and the next and the next.  If
we can keep the feeling like it was on Saturday, it will be all good.
No doubt in my mind.  This event changed the minds of several people in
the city who had negative opinions before hand about raves in general.
I learned this morning that someone from City Council was there for 2
hours.  He said he was very impressed and felt that it was a great
alternative to the bar scene. If they can see that there are young
people doing this legitimately and safely (ah, sorry for those of you
that tripped in the dark or got caught up in the mesh), the reputation
of raves will improve.

I'd have to say that the crowd was one of the best I've been around.
Coming from a slightly older gal, there's nothing worse than feeling
uncomfortable at a rave where everyone seems way messed up.  Obviously
people were "stimulated" at Magick.  Probably a mixture of music, vibe,
and chemical.  But whatever it was, it was great.  And to my knowledge
NO K!!!!!!  We worked hard to get the word out that it was under no
circumstances welcome.  So, whoever was responsible for keeping it out,
thanks to you.

 Special thanks to MrRab, Don the Wizard, Electrolyte Randy, Eyegasm
Chip, Dutch & Steve from Midnite Blue, Lovelight Jamie, Deirdre (Pink
wigs are the best), Steve Ford, E-Rock (some little girl better snatch
him up soon.  he is THE best guy), Dave, Nikki, Sunshine Dori, Frankie,
Todd and the entire wood chip massive (dinner on me anytime you want),
Andy da Pooh and all of the punkin carving fools, Sunshine Matt for
e-mail inspiration Security Don, Howard from the Arena.  And if there's
anyone to thank for this it's Julian from the Arena.  GO PLAY PAINTBALL
YOU GUYS!  GIVE THIS MAN YOUR BUSINESS ( I'm sure he might give a raver
discount).

Well, my pillow is calling me.  My dogs need some lovin' (not my feet,
my puppies).  My wheels are turning.  This is the best time to give me
suggestions for DJs you want to hear in the future, etc. etc.  Let's get
started on the pb-cle party.  My time is yours now.

-Kelly

hi Guys and gals and everybody in between, i have wanted to throw a house
party ever since i moved in about a year ago, so i saw that there was kind of
an open date on SAT NOVEMBER 21, 1998.  I usually name my parties, this one
will be called "Take the A Train-a collection of my favorite hits".  i can
only have about 30 or so kids over and it would be nice if we could set up
some tables for yunz guyz who want to spin.  as usual i will hand out bags
loaded with toys, light sticks, and lots of candy and other stuff to make the
party enjoyable.  i will be printing up some flyers soon, please "E"-mail me
directly at MrRab@AOL.com if you are interested or would like to spin.  this
will be kind of a pre-party to quondam beats. the party will be in the
pitsburgh area hope to hear from you soon. p.L.u.R. {;-[)+< mark

i was just going through all the goodies i picked up at magick and i came
across an informational flyer that i totally don't remember receiving but i
think it's groovey as all hell.  at the top it says, "info-e: practical
information about ecstasy."  at the bottom it says, "from your friends at pb-
cle."  whoever is doing this ... you don't have to identify yourself ... but i
think this is one of the bestest superific ideas i've seen for a while, and i
don't know why i hadn't seen it sooner.

it's got some basic information, and it safely takes a neutral stance on
controversial issues.  my favorite part is when it points out what should be
obvious:

"LESS IS MORE."

in one of my psych classes we've been learning all kinds of fun stuff.  (i'm
constantly holding back incriminating questions.*)  so ... there are several
theories which attempt to explain etiological causes of drug addiction.  one
of the phenomena they have to address is called "anhedonia."  it means just
what it sounds like it means - not having fun.  i wrote down a quote from my
professor: "you can take more, but you'll enjoy it less."  this is true even
if your craving increases.  you have to let your craving continue for a little
bit ... don't try tosatisfy it immediately.  if you try to acheive the high
again ... well, you won't.  so your pleasure decreases, your craving
increases.  your craving increases, your consumption increases.  your
consumption increases, your pleasure decreases.  

that's addiction.

okay so e isn't addictive.  that's because it lacks the craving quality.  but
it has all the other mechanisms.  LESS IS MORE.

love,
spye

*just a fun story i remembered:
freshman year i had a bio class.  there was a girl prone to flippantly asking
dumb questions without realizing she sounded dumb.  one day the professor was
talking about male ejaculate, and that it has a high sugar content.  she
asked, why doesn't it taste sweet?

Whats up kiddies, I would like popular opinion on an 
idea I'm swinging around, I have the oppurtunity to
do a weekly night at a really nice spot in youngstown.
I'm considering Wensday nights, I will let all you 
pb-cle kids in for 1 buck, and I will be looking to book at least one list DJ a week . But there is a catch, to keep this space I need people to actully show up. So,what I wanna know is what kind of list member support I can expect. If you think you can come to y-town once in while let me know, any input you guys give me will be GREATLY appreciated.

Good list!
More Jazzy/Intell Suggestions:

- check out anything on the Partisan label - very nice new stuff - 
  plus the guys behind the label are very DIY and into socialism
  they have some creative productions...not always great, but sometimes
  incredible...

- The John B Album "Visions" (on Formation - a good deal of jazzy and
  almost trancy numbers...one of the best drum + bass albums)

- if you like funky & jazzy (although not exactly 'intelligent') stuff,
  try the DrumFunk Hooliganz Album (on Moving Shadow), and any
  of the new records on the label Hospital.

Hey kids - got a Q for you.

I'm thinking of buying a tapedeck to dub mixtapes on, 
and I'm looking for something high quality, but not audiophile
quality (and cost).  Also if anyone knows about a deck that can
do 100% quality high-speed dubbing I'd like recommendations on that too.

sounds good to me, except that I would make the early one a little earlier,
and have that one be by the bathrooms.
Then have one at 2 on the floor.
I think that would be perfect!

Guess the great turnouts @ ATOMIC have finally paid off. :-)

This could be a bit chilly though, I know I usually dance my ass to a
heated frenzy anyways, but I wonder if they have heat?

And I hope the porta-john situation is better as well!

Best costume I saw this year:  someone in a 70's cream-marbled suit w/big
assed lapels.  His face was done up all bloody.  He went as (you guessed

    I guess I'll identify myself......it's me...little 'ol r@tfink.......
I thought it'd be a good idea since not everyone knows these things and the more
responsibly we use drugs, if we do at all, the better it is for everyone. I
thought by putting the "from your friends" thing on the bottom, we could start to
develop a good reputation for the list.

Please--->If anyone would like to help pass these flyers out, please e-mail me
and I'll send you the file. I've already put alot of time/money into these so I'd
love some help. I really don't mind doing these because these are "my people" and
if I can help the scene in any little way, I'll do it without a second thought.

keep it real......

THE ANALOG PRIMER
I've never heard of a tapedeck that did high speed dub that sounded anything
less than Taco Bell drive through quality sound.  I LOVE tapedecks though.
My recommendation (keep in mind this is coming from an experimental, analog,
lo-fi angle) is that you get a hold on one of those hardwired
turntable/tuner/tapedeck stereo's that were popular in the late 80's/ early
90's.  I, personally, use a Panasonic bookshelf unit like this.  As a matter
of fact I mix all my 4 - track stuff down to the tapedecks in these.  If you
mix from alternate sources (reel to reel, live instrument, 4-track, CD) make
sure it has at the very least one aux. or CD input.  Output is not always a
big deal as you can usually get by with the headphone jack and a scattered
lot of those fun, lustful Radio Wack adapters.  The only drawback is that
you have to find one with a good pause button.  Preferably one of the olde
spring loaded ones.  Those digital pause buttons on the newer decks are like
kryptonite to me.  They always advance the tape a little before they pick up
(which completely dishevels any accuracy if you like to drop your groove
after a vocal or quote sample).  Have a ball with your bookshelf unit.  They
have personalities.  Mine even has a name.  It is called No. 5  because of
all the wires patched into it "No disassemble No. 5!!!".  My unit has high
speed too, but I never use it.  Unfortunately the sound quality will always
be lower than reg. time dub. I hope this has been inspiring and
informative.  By the way Geoff and Tom, Thanks for the jazzy/intel jungle
recommendations.

P.S. If anyone knows where I can find a panasonic bookshelf unit, lemme
know...  No. 5 just broke it's pause button. :o(

I hope this helps...

I would first off like to thank all of the people i met.  It was nice to
finaly put some faces with names.  After arriving at the party 20 minutes
late(i am extremely sorry kelly, i swear i thought it was 9:30, i never show
up late!!!) I was rushed to the tables to spin.  This Being my first
appearance in pittsburgh, i was kind of nervous how my music would go over.  I
was also thinking that there wouldn't be many people there because none of my
friends go out that early ever.  I was wrong.  the room was filling up quite
nicely about half way through my set.  All in all i had a really fun time
playing.

Now for the rest.  Gennerally i had a good time, although i was not quite into
most of the music.  I liked felix more than the last time i saw him, but who
really blew me away was the guy after him, which was Eric Davenport i
belive(could someone confirm this for me please)  He played alot of the same
style tracks as i do, deep tech-house. real funky like.  

I am really not a big trance fan at all, and it seemed like alot of the people
in that city are.  It's just not my thing though so i really couldn't get into
Dr. Trance at all. but it's all good.  

I would like to thank Kelly and Rich for having me down and would love to play
in your town again soon.  

thanks again,
Jason

I apologize if this has been asked already, but does anyone know if a
Technics SL-1700 for $30 would be a good buy?  I just want something to play
some records with quality.  Not going to use it for mixing or anything.
Also, what kind of cartridge would I get for it? Thanks...

technics rs-tr333 dual casette deck. one of the best that ever was and

norm/hi speed dubbing that doesn't suck ass. i have torture tested this

the whole key is that this thing is synched perfectly. the motors when you
hi-speed dub are synched *precisely*. and i don't give a good goddamn how
fucked up the tape is that you put in there. i put in a tape that one of
my other decks fucking destroyed totally.. i straightened it out, undid
any twists, and did a hi-speed dub. 

it came out perfect.

it won't eat tapes (i don't think it even can!), it's reliable, and it's
affordable. what more could you want?

i have to say on this one ... i might have to put more faith in the 
"scientific study" than your "personal experience".   i think it is 
dangerous to post something like   "i've done E before and now i'm 
happier and get more done".   it's  like saying "over the past 6 years 
i've done cocaine and now i'm a much better driver and i have a way 
better job".   these may not be related ....get my drift?  and some 
people who aren't as bright as you may not understand

I had a great time at Magick. It was my second rave and now I'm hooked. I'd
like to thank Di for that. I met lots of people, but some things are sort of
fuzzy. To everyone I met I liked you all and I hope to see you again. I hope
to be @ Get Freaky 3 this weekend. Looking forward to meeting more fun people.
I live near Youngstown. I just transfered from the University of Toledo to
Youngstown State, so if anyone knows anything going on around my area let me
know.

1700sl is good for just playing, and okay for mixing if you started on
tables *without* stupid pitch bend sliders. :P

i suggest the stanton 500al ($30 at guitar center) if the 1700 will take
it. i don't think it will. i don't remember the 17's too well. if it
won't, no prob. i stick with the tried and true stanton trackmaster.

      ketamine = ketamine, and that's all you want. it's
      used commercially as a small animal tranquilizer.
      special [super] k is a street name, the commercial names
      are more like ketaset which is a liquid preparation
      available from AHP corporation (fort dodge division)
      in 10cc intramuscular form. there is also a ketaset
      plus, which i assume is either higher concentration
      or higher quantity, or both. prolly higher concentration
      since 10ccs is a large injection for a really small
      animal... wouldn't you just like to know :]. and then
      you can get two different preps of ketamine hydrochloride,
      and ketaject from phoenix scientific - all of these
      are available to (i assume) registered vet clinics 
      from chemical supply houses. don't use your credit card.

      you can use the stuff intramuscular if you want,
      or vacuum/boil it down and sniffle it, or if you're feeling
      really adventurous and like the idea of an embolism
      (or just admire the heroin chic) you can use it 
      intravenously. please remain seated while doing so.

      note that this post is not intended entirely in a 
      humorous manner. ask a vet about super special k
      and you may find yourself an object of a quiet call
      to your local law enforcement agency. order this
      stuff and you may have a similar experience.

      or get a quick ambulance ride.

      knowledge = power.

      duh. it's probably something really violent, 
      damaging, and synthesized that some dork boiled
      down in his bedroom. 

      probably not illegal, either, but then neither

      i warn you not to support _any_ shit that you do
      not know _exactly_ what it is [supposed to be],
      _exactly_ what it does and might do, and _basically_
      what to do and where to go if it doesn't.

      as far as i'm concerned, there isn't bad shit and 
      good shit, only ignorant shit.

      ignorance/greed/[humans] = EVIL. beware.

      panasonic/technics make sweeeeet dual well decks.
      look at their RS-TR272 - it's nu so i as i haven't 
      paid much attention to tape technology (analog anyway)
      for at least a year i wouldn't know _exactly_. it'll
      do highspeed flawlessly tho i'm sure if it has the
      same quality heads/motors they were using 5 years ago...
      cost: under 2 bills.

      aiwa used to package nice little s-decks for a 
      couply of bills with the most solid well i've seen
      on ANY consumer deck, but they seem to have 
      discontinued it in favor of pyramidal boom-boxes.
      like anyone can play s in any case...

      sony isn't the king of electronics for nix. treat
      yourself to what has to be hands-down the most 
      beautiful and useful commercial website on the
      net and trot over to www.sel.sony.com. their
      TC-WE305 with a msrp of $120 seems to make your
      decision a no-brainer. this is where i'd be - or
      simply get their TC-WA9ES, which at 14.25 pounds
      weighs half as much as a tech12 and costs almost
      twice as much ($990) - but look for a decent discount,
      and with this mass of pitch-controlled aluminum
      and ceramic your copies will be about as good as
      they get in a dual-well semi-pro deck.

      </babble>

      lemme know what you get, and how it sounds? ta.

      oh - look for second-hand decks in places like
      northern audio exchange - check local yellow pages
      for used audio gear stores.

      cheers.

You know, I meant to respond to this post too, but never quite got
around to it.

Just one point really: Why would they cut K with MDMA, when most of
the E you get lately isn't even cut with MDMA? It would suck if I had
to start buying K in order to get real E. :-0

this is actually true of many many things. as you increase your
consumption of something (food, clothing, consumer goods, etc.), the
marginal utility of each additional unit is lower. so that 2nd candy bar
is still going to taste pretty good, but will be less satisfying than
the first.

I think we need to discuss a problem that has been more and more prominent
lately -- ridiculously long lines of ravers waiting to get in.

Although the following comments have to do with the recent "Magick", they
should not in any way be read as a criticism of the party per se.  Once I
was inside, I had a great time -- the space, vibe and music were
fantastic!  I'm using this party as an example of a growing trend that
needs to be addressed before the snow and real cold hits this area.

I arrived at the line outside Magick at precisely 11:05 P.M. and didn't
actually enter the building until just before 1:00 A.M., about two hours
later.  Considering the temperature was hovering around 40-45 degrees,
this was a bit much.  If not for the fine character of ravers in general,
I sincerely doubt there would have been a party at all -- who on earth
would want to endure that and still have to pay to get inside?

Although promoters traditionally spend all of their energy on securing a
fine dj line-up and a unique atmosphere for the interior, something is
significantly lacking when people aren't able to enter for hours on end.
This happened at "Motive" in Columbus and also at the recent Dayton party.
Of course, it's been happening on and off for years, but I've noticed an
alarming trend of late where it's happening virtually every single party.

>From my vantage point of going absolutely no where in line, I was able to
target two primary causes:

1) People Cutting In Line
2) Understaffed and Uninformed Admission

1) The way to keep people from cutting is for the promoters to have both a
rope and someone on a megaphone walking up and down gently warning
everyone please not to cut (this can be done politely and firmly at the
same time). The line needs to be single file too, so the rope should be
rather close to the side of the building.  Once the norm is in place, the
others in line will enforce it.  I've seen this done very effectively, and
it makes a huge difference.  If you permit cutting, then "outsiders" are
the ones who are penalized for not knowing others in line.  I drove all
the way from Cleveland and had to endure almost the same amount of time
standing in the freezing cold as I did driving in the first place -- this
is while Pittsburgh natives spent as little as 5 minutes in the same
conditions.  THAT is wrong -- and can easily be remedied.

2) If you are only able to have one entrance, then by all means have an
arsenal of people taking money, doing bags searches or whatever.  I figure
with a party of that size, if you're not admitting 15 a minute, you're not
adequately prepared at the entrance.  Once the 2:00 hour arrives and the
lines are no longer as long, these door people can switch to other roles
on the inside.  Remember, there are a lot of kids who would be
all too willing to help work the door for a few hours in exchange for free
or reduced admission.  It's just a matter of planning -- not a matter of
resources!

When done properly, there should never be more than a 20 minute wait in 
line.  Promoters are doing a really good job of virtually everything else
these days except handling the "outside" time.  I'm sure that with a
little extra attention, this will be addressed too in the near future.

Sincerely,

Braden

Hi everybody...

I'm sure these questions get asked a lot, but I want to run them by people
who know what they're talking about before I drop a bunch of cash.

I'm about to buy my first set of decks and mixer.

Obviously, I'm going to try to afford 1200s...if I can't, is the Gemini
PT2000 okay?  I've heard it's as close as you can come to the 1200s...  as
far as carts go, are the Stanton 500ALs okay or should I spend more for the
trackmasters?

And what do I need in a mixer... are kill switches important or are rotary
kills good enough?  I was looking at the Gemini KL-10 or the 626... any
other suggestions?

Thanks so much everyone!

Dan

Where any of you people at the show yesterday? I talked to WINK before 
he went on and he said it would be alot of "trippy head music" I thought 
it was cool except those videos of cleveland got annoying. That sample 
he had of the guy saying "Cleveland's all about the rock n roll museum 
man" was funny. The crowd wasn't as good as the one at the crystal 
method in October though---only about 3 people including me actually 
danced----but it was cool. After his set I talked to Wink more and he 
said that that set was more "head music" then dance. Meat Beat Manifesto 
was very good that's the first time I've seen them and I enjoyed the 
show. The opener (before wink) was these two guys called Grassy Knole or 
some shit, they were okay but all they had was 1 turntable, a mixer, a 
cd player ( sony car), and an sp-808 groove sampler the music wasn't 
that bad but they like stood there there was no lighting effects the 
must they did was nod there heads.---> tell me what ya think

well, a problem is with lack of trustworthy people. you need alot of heads to
have a party runnin right, and to find enough to have the inside secure AND
have the money being taken/stored correctly is going to be a problem with an
event that is large. i can only think of  4 or 5 people that i would trust
taking money at one of our  parties, and most of them are necessary for other
things also.

I agree that the line was really ridiculous. I am sick now to prove it. I want
to goto Cleveland this weekend, but was seriously thinking of not going if I
get out of work any later than 7, because I don't want to stand out in the
cold again.--Meredith

get technics by all means. if you dont have the money, save up for a little
while more. stereo city in philly sold me mine for $400 each new. spinning on
non-techniques is basically useless. if you really need to buy them gemini's, i
have a better suggestion. give me half the money you were goonna pay for em,
ill kick you in the balls, and we'll call it even. non techs are a waste of
money.

as far as carts go, trackmasters are nice, but not in anyway necessary,
especially if yer starting out. with mixers, its not necessary to have lots of
flashy stuff...buy a cheap mixer first and get good with it, then purchase a
mixer with more functions if you deem it necessary. all you need are

1.headphone jack

2.volume control for each channel.

3.crossfader (generally, the quicker, the better)

4.line/phono switch for cutting.

5. main e.q.

anything else (like separate eq's for each channel, transform buttons, effects
etc.) are basically unnecessary.

Hmm, me and my friends got there by 11.30 and didn't get in. we made it to
the first flight of stairs, and didn't think we were gonna make it.
Considering the people up at the table said there was basically no room,
left and people were still going in. and by the time we actually got in, we
would have missed most of the djs I wanted to hear anyway.  I was real sad
tooo, because were were from buffalo, visitng some friends in pittsburg, we
were all dressed up and it was gonna be their first rave. It looked like a
mob scene on the stairs and outside. I don't think people shold have been
linedup on the stairs, because it is dangerous and the staff people couldn't
quikly get down and up the stairs. The tickets and searching should have
been in the first little area-or someone should have at least been holding
people back.  Presale ticks would have also speed up the entry and gave an
idea of how many were coming, but that would have defeated the whole costume
idea.
Any way , congrats on the big turnout, I am sure it was awesome-I am just a
little diseaponted, that's all wishing I could have gone. Maybe I will be in
pittsburg someday again soon
:(

>SWAT Teams Target Ravers
>
>Discovery Channel show: Miami SWAT
>
>Background:
>
>SWAT was conceived by the Los Angeles Police Department in the early
>1970's in the aftermath of the Watts Riots and a university gunman.
>It was designed to give military-style tactics and weaponry to local
>police departments. Substantial insight can be gained from knowing
>that SWAT originally stood for "Special Weapons Attack Team",
>but was later changed to "Special Weapons and Tactics"; the change of
>name is barely a nod to political correctness and "newspeak".
>
>Some critics of SWAT have pointed out that the paramilitary tactics,
>which include reacting with overwhelming force to any situation, are
>fundamentally different than those of domestic law enforcement. They
>have pointed out that once law enforcement starts thinking of having
>an enemy, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy; they create enemies
>in the communities that they are created to protect.
>
>The warrior fantasy and desire of law enforcement officers to be
>"the best" has led to a proliferation of SWAT teams, even in small cities
>which probably do not have any realistic need to have one. In larger
>cities, they are probably overstaffed. Perhaps due to the overstaffing,
>due to fewer domestic war-like incidents, or just due to simple diffusion,
>SWAT team members are branching out to other fields of law enforcement,
>such as drug enforcement. This is actually part of a larger problem,
>which is that once an apparatus like SWAT has been assembled, the members
>find reasons to continue and even expands its existence, even if the
>original reason ceases to be relevant. After all, who would say,
>"No, we're not doing any good here anymore, lay us all off?"
>
>Details:
>
>In this section of the show, a SWAT team member is in an expensive,
>sophisticated, custom-built police surveillance vehicle. The narrator
>mentions that the few police officers have even seen the vehicle, and that
>it is "top secret" (a military term meaning "information or material the
>unauthorised disclosure of which is likely to damage national interests in
>an exceptionally grave manner"). Inside, we see large banks of rack-mount
>equipment. The narrator describes that they are stationed outside a rave

>glowsticks, sporting dyed hair and bottles of water.
>
>Cut back to inside of the vehicle.

hell yeah this is getting to be a problem.   i've seen it elsewhere alot too.
the worst is when a party is supposed to start at say....  9pm and then
they say "arrive early to ensure admission" and you get there at 8-9 and
then the dont open it until say 11....  hmmmm,,, you've got a REAL long
line by then and then it dont move coz of the full body search at the door.
i went to a big one (2000+ ppl) in bufallo where there was a 15 person line
when i got there, guess why?   one person selling tickets, one person
tearing them, one person stamping, and one person asking to see your bag.

my friends waited in line for about an hour and a half at majick and said
fuck it and went elsewhere.  i talked to ppl as late as 2:30 that had JUST
gotten thru the line!  

i agree with braden that i shouldnt have to wait in line longer than i
drove, coz i'm usually driving at least an hour - hour & a half to the
closest stuff....

just my gripe for the week.

Yep, that AP news report was in fact, true.
(someone claimed it was fake. what the fuck?
 it looked real to me and I am the editor of Newsweek)

The study was also on the Daily Show
on Comedy Central today.
Craig Kilborn tried to make it funny,
but failed miserably.

I think they showed some rave scenes,
but thanks to MDMA, my memory is failing me.

    Hey there kiddies! It's time for r@tfink's review.....finally.

Tom's House (Jack-o-Evil or Hall-o-Evil):
    Well.....it was a big surprise to end up at Tom's house saturday
night cuzz I had not planned on it until talking to Casey a little
before we left....So, Benny, Liz (Veggie418), and I ended up there
around 10:00PM or so......I'd never met Tom before and really didn't
know what to expect........It turns out that he is my long-lost brother;
separated at birth and all that. We ended up spinnin all night......what
a great time! Jungle jungle jungle.....I got my fix for the night. Tom
and all his friends are great people and Liz and I had a blast! (Benny
had to go.....but we told her all about it) Thanks again Tom!

Magick:
    Well.......to start, the line was long because they weren't letting
more people in until people left. It was cold, but I saw alot of my
friends so the time went a little faster. We finally got in and it was
crowded and hot as fuck, but that's cool. The arena was plesantly cool,
but the wet paint was really a bummer. I didn't get to lean against the
wall and look cool.....but that's ok. : )
    We missed the really good sets that everyone was talking about, but
the music was still good. House isn't my fave, but it was still
definatly fun.
    Net-Meet/pb-cle: I'm sorry we missed the net-meet (long line) but I
think I ended up seeing most everyone throughout the night. The sign was
like a big pb-cle magnet! I would walk 5 feet and 3 kids would come up
to me......walk 5 feet and again more pb-cle kids! It was great. Trout
and I were hangin' out alot and that was fun.......especially when he
was holdin' the gun up to my back! I glad to see that pb-cle was
definatly reprazentin' at Magick!!!!! Even into the weeeeeeeeee hours of
the morning! It was great when we were in front of the lobby stage
around 6AM everyone was still dancin' around the sign!!!!! Way to go
kidz!!!! It was great to see everyone! Shouts to Trout (especially),
Frankie G, Keebler, Di, Butter,  Benny, Liz (Veggie418--->she's new),
Count Chocula, little sara, icarus, and everyone else I'm forgetting!
Love ya all! You really made the night for me! Can't wait to see
everyone again soon!

im not going. i thought i wanted to go when i saw the flyer, but then
realised that i hate everything, so why would get freaky 3 be an exception?
besides, everyone knows that all sequels that arent star wars or indiana
jones suck.

i was there.  i enjoyed meat beat manifesto far more than wink.  there is a
fine line between mental/"head" music and boring.  i think he would have been
far more interesting had he not gone into actual song part of his set, but oh
well.

first off, gemini sucks ass. especially if you're just starting out. it's
like shooting yourself in the foot if you waste the money on the gemini
trash.

you want to check out the numark dj-in-a-box kit. NUMARK. not gemini.
it'll run you about $400. two turntables, numark mixer, basically
everything you need to get started except needles.

stanton 500al's are broadcast needles. not spinning needles. they won't
fit, anyways. wrong connectors, if this pic is correct. i'd normally say
'yeah, shell out the cash for the trackmasters' but there's other
alternatives. i can't remember the model name or number, but ortofon has a
nice beginners needle (it's rugged as all hell) and they're about $60/ea.
just find the ortofon needle that's about $60 and that should be it.

depends how you want to spin, and what you want to spin. i personally
can't use regular mixers, because i'll have too many tables going or ready
to go. (8 table acid-jazz massive-groove in tha house!) so kill switches
are VERY *VERY* important to me. the mixers i own all have kill switches
on every channel. however, when i'm only doing two decks, i have a Vestax
PMC05Pro mixer, with a Ketyra Audio XF4x256dc x-fader replacement.
however, something tells me this is out of your price range, as i recall
having spent a total of $700 on it. or somewhere around there.

i'd suggest the MTX MX35 or the Numark DM1001X. the MTX MX35 has a
replaceable x-fader. i personally suggest you replace it immediately. it's
$70 from guitar center, and the Ketyra Audio XF2x128dc x-fader dropin is
$50. email me privately about anything you might want from Ketyra Audio;
we've got a very complete line, but it's all *extremely* high end,
usually. 

if you're willing to shell out the $189 for a gemini 626 (which is real
trash. knobs are too close, the x-fader absolutely HAS to be replaced,
it's a bitch to work on, the list goes on and on..), you may as well go
for the MTX MX3000. mixer & sampler combo. 3 stereo phono, 1 stereo
line/cd, 2 mic inputs. 9 band eq. replaceable x-fader. leds. and it's $199
from guitar center. 

any of the mixers i've mentioned here will work great for you, no matter
what you spin, except maybe the MTX MX35. it's called the 'battle board
ii' for a reason. ;) (it's a competition mixer. my competition mixer,
personally, is a ketyra audio m/c-2c848:)

no prob :)

EXACTLY....        i believe the phenomenon you are referring to is "the 
law of diminishing returns".         it is an economic principle about 
capitalism but it applies well to many things in life ... the more you 
get of something the less you appreciate it

i don't know if anyone knew the story with signing in @ MAGICK, but the owner
of the paintball space required that people sign in as they entered. This, on
top of the massive amount of people, adds up to long lines. I might add, even
though people were searched, a thing that wouldn't be necessary if people
could respect the scene, there was still tagging. i am sorry, but i have to
add that when you, meaning those who tag, do so, you are ruining it for
yourself as well as others. that is one more thing that adds to long lines.
this is definitely something that can be remedied. if you see someone tagging
at a party, friend or not, tell someone. if you want lines to move faster,
people need to be more trustworthy. i am not trying to be mean, but richard
and kelly had things very well organized and i don't think they should be
taking slack for a problem that has plagued our scene for as long as i can
remember... my 2 cents...

peace,
dori

i watched this episode on discovery sunday a couple weeks ago (right after
their navy SEALS show).
this transcription is a pretty accurate account of their little rave soiree
('cept the guy involved was a
SWAT member on a second drug enforcement related job) which was only about 5
or so minutes of the
show. really the rest of it was just generic SWAT stuff dealing with generic
armed criminals...
and gotta love that propoganda and cheap political plug |P

Alright... i gotta know... where is a cost-effective, quality place to
get vinyl mastered and pressed. I've goten a couple catalogues and
they either seem way overpriced (100 12" for $700 @ discmakers) or way
UNDERpriced (500 12" for $550 @ fat tracks recording)  If anyone has
any info/experiences with various companies, i'd really appreciate the
info because i want to get my material out, but the tape form SUCKS
and CD's cost too damn much, plus on vinyl, I have a chance of you
list dj's to spin my stuff <eg>.

Okay kiddies ... here's the 'other' side of the story.

From: RickMAPS@aol.com
To: maps-forum@maps.org
Subject: MAPS: MDMA Neurotoxicity Research

You may have seen publicity about a new study of MDMA users that just
came out in the Lancet. The study is by George Ricaurte, M.D. I spoke
with him several days ago about the results and feel it is important
to keep several points in mind.  

First, the MDMA subjects in the study feel fine.  Second, it is
difficult to make sure that matched controls are really matched on all
dimensions. The best way to study MDMA-related serotonin changes is to
test people before and after the administration of MDMA. This has yet
to be done. Third, even if the serotonin transporter changes are due
to MDMA, they make be entirely without significance. Brain cells can
up and down regulate to function in enviroments of greater or lesser
amounts of neurotransmitters.  

Fourth, the serotonin system does not seem to substantially decline
with age. Therefore, the idea that reduced serotonin system changes
that are asymptomatic will become a problem over time is not supported
by the evidence about the serotonin system, or by the observation of
problems of MDMA users age 60 or older, of which there are many.
Fifth, there is no evidence at all that a few doses of MDMA given in a
therapeutic context, or any context, would have a significant impact
on serotonin levels, much less produce functional or behavioral
consequences related to serotonin deficits. Thus, this research does
not provide evidence sufficient to justify refusal to permit MDMA
psychotherapy research. 

The Novartis Foundation is sponsoring a conference on the risks of
MDMA, to take place in London on December 4. Dr. Ricaurte will be
presenting his findings there, as will other researchers who have
looked at the risk side of the equation. MAPS is paying for Dr.
Charles Grob to attend the conference, and also Dr. Moshe Kotler and
Dr. Adam Darnell, the MDMA researchers from Israel who are working to
obtain permission to study the use of MDMA in the treatment of PTSD in
a MAPS-funded study. As always, MAPS is interested in all the
scientific information about MDMA, both risks and benefits.

Unfortunately, ever since MDMA was criminalized in 1985, no research
in the US has yet been permitted into the beneficial uses of MDMA,
while probably in excess of $10 million has been spent seeking
evidence of  harmful effects. MAPS has been supporting Dr. Grob's
efforts to initiate a study of the use of MDMA in cancer patients for
many years. The FDA has taken three months to review the third draft
of the protocol, with some response expected soon. 

What follows are some additional notes on Ricaurte's latest effort in
The Lancet, by Dr. Karl Jansen. 

An important point to note is that the subjects were tested for
psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, and were all
found to be normal. In other words, these reductions in transporter
binding relative to the control group existed without any anxiety and
depression, as established by the experimenters themselves. This is in
line with animal experiments which show that considerable persistent
changes do not result in persistent behavioural changes in these
animals. They cannot be distinguished from controls. While E may cause
some brain changes, the evidence for depression and anxiety as a
long-term time bomb is entirely lacking, especially if the control
group are heavy cocaine users. 

So far, these changes in the serotonin transporter are without proven
effect.  The midweek post E dip is due to an acute fall in serotonin,
not same thing at all. 

Of course, these changes are very minor compared to those of
alcoholism, which causes gross brain atrophy, difficulty walking,
major depression, 10% of alcoholics commit suicide, severe memory
problems, etc. etc. - somehow news of this has not been flashed around
the world... I wonder why??? You don't need fancy PET scans to see
alcoholic damage - a pair of scales postmortem will do just fine! 

A major reservation I have about this study is that there has been a
high degree of selection of cases. These are not 14 random cases, far
from it.   Ricaurte has been collecting hundreds of cases for many
years. Nicholas (Saunders) and I sent him people who had taken over
1,000 pills. These people, including Nicholas himself (who had only
taken about 100), were told by Ricaurte that they had a clean bill of
health. So why aren't they in the published study??!!! Why indeed...
These 14 cases have been carefully      selected from a huge sample,
which totally invalidates the statistics which have been used to show
significance. In other words, people who had taken over 1,000 pills
and went through Ricaurte's study with normal results have somehow not
been included amongst the elect, which is very suspicious. I wonder if
they didn't just select the far end of a very large bell curve to
publish? I note that 400 pills was the highest in the sample, so my
friends were definitely not 'in' and they were definitely told that
they were O.K... Something isn't right here. 

The other problem is the highly questionable statement that the
absence of neuropsychiatric disorder means that the low levels of
transporter could not have been pre-existing. It is wholly possible
that persons with lower levels of transporter and other neurochemical
differences experience drives to take drugs of this nature, or to seek
stimulation and novelty in other ways. Thus pre-existing, genetic
differences in dopamine receptors are seen in some alcoholics, but
these drives need not be met with alcohol - they can also make people
more adventurous, more inclined to become innovators and explorators.
To imply that they must have a 'neuropsychiatric condition' is wholly
false. 

                                  Best

we were also very concerned about rumors that the "boy that sucks" (bts) crew was
coming to the party.  better safe than having weapons inside a party like that.
there are many reasons that lines sometimes take long to clear away.  i'm sure
people would rather wait in line than take the risk of entering an unsafe
environment.  and yes, having people sign in at the door did hold up the line.

it's just funny to me how people seem to want the best of both worlds.  they want
an underground event.  warehouses seem to be a favorite.  yet they want a box
office type door with full security that somehow ignore certain things they might
find.  catch my drift?  you can't have it all.  you must realize that most events
are organized with the best possibility being to break even.  these days it seems
like anything else is either a fluke or magick (haha).  what i'm trying to say is
that in order for "raves" to continue on as "raves" and not turned into big shiny
money making dances, you have to deal with things like venue owners and a little
dirt.  remember what we're talking about here.  i'm not saying that safety issues
should be ignored, ever.  the people on the stairwell...it was either that or
take the risk of having it shut down from all the people being out on the
street.  believe me, lessons were learned this weekend.  but in the end, there
was no trouble and perhaps even a little rave hsitory was made by yall.

rave on!

hells yeah, liz is a cool girl, and matt is my hero. these kids are so much fun to

not offended, they were amused. welcome to the list liz!

<thread clipped for your pleasure>

Just gotta come on and represent the DJ Jazzy Jeff Scratchmaster!
No features, no quality.  The fader is terrible for scratching.

Its not the size of the mixer my friends....its how you use it.

Or something like that.

Remember back in the day they all used belt-drive tables.
And the didn't have mixers at all, but seperate PA's in two different
rooms, and the dj made the crowd run between the rooms when he wanted to
'cut'.  I won't even tell you about scratchin', because that was just too
crazy.

Brian asked me to post this for him=85

S a l o n g o

"We come together to create something beautiful out of love"

What REALLY happened at Family Affair IV?

A letter from Underground Peace society's Brain Wheeler

   Greetings and love.  First and foremost IanI the Underground Peace
Society gives complete thanks and praise to Jah Almighty for the =

strength and wisdom to persevere.  I am Brian Wheeler (Ras Ifree)
organizer of the festival known as Family Affair 1, 2, 3 and 4. After
much contemplation and meditation I feel it is now time to shed some
light on the truth concerning FA4.  There have been many rumors
half truths, and down right lies that have been circulated in regards
to my personal integrity, allocation of Family Affair funds, and the
Underground Peace Society in general.
   The organization production, promotion, and everything else =

Associated with the Underground Peace Society and Family Affair is
Soley the responsibility of myself.  Hence, planning and financing
An event that costs in excess of $150,000 can be quite taxing =

financially and creatively. I've taken much pride in the fact =

Family Affair is one of the few, if not the only annual festival =

Of it's kind in the US that is completely INDEPENDENT of corporate
Sponsorship. Therefore, when overtaking a challenge such as this,
There are bound to be some levels of disorganization, uncommunicative
-ness, and personal error within the infrastructure of UPS
   The vision of the Underground Peace Society is a simple, yet complex
Thought process that entails the promotion of arts and culture through
Creative expression.  IanI envision an overground creative community
devoid of all negative energy existing purely on the strength of artists
who represent cooperative evolution through communal, spiritual, and
personal experience.
   The nature of Family Affair attracts much attention from both the
Underground audiences AND artists.  Thus placing myself in a fairly
Awkward position.  Who shall be booked to perform?  Since my primary
concerns are for the adequate representation of Ohio artists, sound/
light companies, and so forth.  I booked about 90% of the artists
that contacted me, while at the same time negotiating with performers
from out of the state.  In turn, creating innumerable nightmares for
myself, with the task of artist scheduling, airfare, flight arrival/
departure times, payments, etc (Hint: never book over 200 performers =

for a show) Nevertheless, I carried on.  It was my belief that the
event would draw a minimum of 5000 attendees, making a profit of =

approximately $50,000 to be split among myself, three primary investors,
and a staff consisting of 10 people.  Unfortunately, things did not
go as planned=85
   It RAINED, no it poured in Athens county. The original site for =

Family Affair was Riverside Amphitheater in Coolville, Ohio.  Four
days before the event, Athens county was under 7 feet of water.
This forced us to find a new venue within days of the event.  A new
venue was found 3 days before the show, Alpine Hills Resort in New
Philadelphia, Ohio.  Visually and geographically Alphine Hills was
Perfect, except it costs $25,000 as opposed to $10,000, which was
Budgeted for the first venue.  We did the only thing we could, agree
To terms and pray we'd get the numbers to cover expenses.  With a =

new venue came major difficulties: (1) We distribute over 70,000 flyers
with directions to Coolville, OH, (2) We had to inform the public of
this sudden change. (3) Ground transportation for incoming performers
had to be drastically changed. (4) An entire new method of securing
this venue had to be established. (5) A rapport had to be established
with the local police, fire, & paramedics. (6) How would we arrange 5
stages in a way that would be conducive to maximum enjoyment? (7) All
stages except for the main stage had to be shut down by midnight. (8)
How do you fit all the performers in with this new restriction? (9) The
Owner of Alphine Hills was an uncooperative prejudiced opportunist. (10)
How do you deal with such a person as this who knows your entire career
and life savings are at his mercy? (11) We had 3 days to figure out how
to deal with items 1-10.
   Needless to say, people did figure out where FA4 took place.  Many
people also figured out how to sneak into the venue and/or obtain =

tickets through illegal means.  Now arises a situation where there
were only funds that accounted for approximately $25,000 to BREAKEVEN.
And I might add that people do not want to believe you did not make
money when they see a campground full of people that they assume paid
for entry.  Now here's a situation I pray I will never be in again.  I =

was in a position where I quite frankly could not pay everyone that I
promised.  Most performers and production people were paid in full,
however there were many artists that were not paid in full, and in some
cases, not at all.  For that, I apologize whole heartedly, and will make
every effort to alleviate FA debts.
   The most hurtful and disheartening facts of all this was the number =

Of people who simply did not, and still don't believe me.  Saturday =

Night, July 4th, I could have explained the situation to people until
I was white with red hair and freckles, and they still would have =

believed that I had thousands upon thousands of dollars ready to be
tucked away in a Swiss bank account.  So I found myself arguing and
explaining more than dealing with other issues pertaining to the =

logistics of FA4.  After having the owner of Alpine Hills wave a gun in
my face since I did not have another four thousand dollars to keep the
water on, I realized I was in a serious unresolvable situation.  At
this point I decided I could take no more; at around 5-6am Sunday
morning I exited my own creation, alone, before its end with $800, a
bruised heart, and a tired spirit.  This was by far, the lowest moment
in my 6 years of involvement of promotion of events.
   My optimism and opinion of the nature of people involved with this
"scene" has definitly been tested by the realities of FA4.  However,
IanI the Underground Peace Society knows that we are here for a higher
Purpose.  This purpose being, bringing the PEOPLE together, by any means
necessary through the power of love.  IanI mission is not yet complete.
So to answer possible future questions, yes, there will be a Family =

Affair 5, 1999.  The realities of how and where are pretty big question
marks???   But, the reason WHY another FA is quite simple.  WHY not?
People of our community please respect and hold dear what has been
Accomplished in regards to the forwarding of "underground" culture.
There are many people who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of seeing
and experiencing the movement of the artistic phenomenon some called
"electronica.  It is to I soul music, the rhythm of our very essence.
Our culture is sacred and wonderful.  Therefore we must not trivialize
the harmony of our community through the wanton use of unnatural things
and behavior unbecoming the beautiful people we are.  Live in peace.

I think if I could place my finger on what first really started getting me
into Electronica it would have to be these guys.  Since they arent coming
to Pittsburgh, I guess I am gonna have to goto Cleveland to see them.
(Better than Philly anyways ;))  Probably not feasible to have a netmeet
for this one.  I am siked anyways. :-)
Anyone else going?

pLuR,

jbrick

Here's another concrete solution for a recurring problem:

If a facility doesn't have adequate bathrooms, the promoter usually brings
in port-o-potties.  "Magick", for instance, had 5 of these lined up
against a wall.

The problem with these is once the door is shut, it's completely dark
inside.  Some people bring flashlights or have glowsticks, but those who
don't often end up guessing where the hole is -- at the expense of those
who must stand in the puddle of his error.  And even with a glow stick or
flashlight, it means that one of your hands is perpetually tied up in
holding the thing.

Solution: Tape a glow stick on the roof inside each of these toilets.
Then there will be ample light for all to see what they are doing all
night long.

here are some problems that i see with raves:

first, of all they are too loud...
  do my ears have to ring so much the next day

second, too many hot chicks wearing skimpy outfits
  how am i supposed to concentrate on the music
with these half naked hussies running around

third, too much wild dancing
  how can i watch the djs when ravers are jumping up and down waving their
arms all over the place

fourth, the flyers that are passed out don't glow in the dark and do not
come with lights attached
   i think that promoters should invest in little lights that clip on to the
flyers so that  i can read them at the party (who can wait until they get
home to plan what party to go to next)

fifth, i cant afford to go to parties
  why cant they all be free?

sixth,  i always miss the net meets
    can we have them at lunchtime where i eat lunch so that i can be there?
------------------------------------------------
just in case anyone is unclear, I AM BEING SARCASTIC

i think some of you should be going to concerts instead of raves
raves are dirty,dark,loud,and sometimes other bad things
i have a suggestion for people who think that 
things need to be perfect DEAL WITH IT or THROW YOUR OWN PARTY

Rich and Kelly had to deal with many situations, 
and pulled off the biggest rave ever in pittsburgh, and people had fun from
what i can tell
there will always be problems, be thankful that 
parties are not getting busted like they are where i am (LA and San
Francisco)

HAVE FUN!!!!

Yes, this always sucks -- and especially for girls.  At Magick some
guy was nice enough to shine a flashlight into one of the stalls for
me while I wiped off the seat (yuck!!!)  When I was done, he growled
huskily, "So, what do I get for shining this light for you?"  I said
"Thank you."  He kept looking at me expectantly, as if I weren't done
speaking.  At that point I slipped away into the lovely stall.  What
does he get?!!  Um, isn't my heartfelt gratitude enough?  Or was I
suppsoed to invite him in with me?!!

Whell, I just wear a big ol' diaper
to all my parties.  That way I can just
let loose without worry.

Another solution to the potty problem
is this:
Start shouting and making a commotion.
Yell things like
"LOOK OUT I'm gonna do some BREAKIN'!!!"
  or
"Clear some ROOM I'm gonna throw down!!!"
 
Then make like you are about to bust out.
After you have everyone's attention,
stand directly in the center of the crowd circle,
pull down your pants, fold in half, and evacuate your bowels
and bladder.  Then pull up your pants and walk away.

ok. i'm not a gear expert or anything but i'll tell you what i know:

> Obviously, I'm going to try to afford 1200s...if I can't, is the
Gemini
> PT2000 okay?  

no! not at all. gemini brand=weak, cheap, plastic, flimsy, and the
durability of a toy made in taiwan. 1200s are absolutely necessary.
1200s are very heavy, have the highest torque (which you'll be sorry
if you don't have it), have metal casings, and will last you literally
your whole life if you take good care of them. your best option will
be to find a used pair in good working order, which should cost around
$700 but not more than $800 total. (i paid $700 for mine, with
cartridges).
 
> far as carts go, are the Stanton 500ALs okay or should I spend more
for the
> trackmasters?

don't get the trackmasters. despite the name, they skip. after you've
got the tables if you've got enough money, get a pair of ortofons with
eliptical stylii. (these are i think around $90 each) spherical stylii
are harder on your records. if you can't afford the ortofons right
away, just get the cheapest cartridges possible to use until you can
afford them. i have stanton 500s still =/ and they suck ass.
 
> And what do I need in a mixer... are kill switches important or are
rotary
> kills good enough?  I was looking at the Gemini KL-10 or the 626...
any
> other suggestions?

again, don't buy anything gemini. numarks (and sometimes vextaxes) are
the best value in mixers. they are reasonably good quality + very
affordable. you can get some shitty gemini mixer with lots of features
that will break in less than a year or you can get a numark with not a
lot of features but it should last several years. the cheapest numarks
are around $100, but the 2002x is i think $200 from pssl + it has 3 eq
knobs on each channel, kill switch buttons on each eq, and a cuefader.
i'm considering trading in my mixer (numark 1190) for one. eqs are
nice to have so you can chop out the bass, then slam it back in, or do
other sculpting-
type effects, but they're not necessary. a cuefader is a really great
thing to have to help you with beatmatching, so you can preview your
mix to check the accuracy before anybody else hears it. but if you're
playing on a decent system, it's like cuefader all the time and you'll
want to block out the sound of it, which brings me to another point,
headphones. i can't recommend any for durability (since something
always breaks on mine + i buy new one), but i have optimus ones from
radio shack + the sound is decent + they've held up fine for about 6
months. anyway, be sure to get the big geeky round headphones that
totally cover your ears. don't get flat ones or "open air design", or
you won't be able to cue properly.

yeah this is true. although i think that 2 or 3 trustable people can
take turns handling money over the course of a night, but for some
other things, like stamping hands, checking stamps, handling tickets,
+ i guess searching bags if necessary, you can use other people you
don't have to know as well, because i've done that for promoters
before who didn't know me all that well.

Aight!  Lemma break it down.  Don't consider anything other than
technics and vestax tables.  
-Technics are the standard, but they know they can sell the exact same
table forever and never improve it without jacking the price up $300
for a little higher torque and a 78 speed.  Anything but the MKII is a
complete rip off in my estimation (except the pimped out gold ones . .
. andy?)

-Vestax on the other hand are trying their best to change some shit
around and improve their tables rather than put out the same thing for
20 years.  I've never used a vestax table, but the torque is the same,
and some have cool shit.  all have the ability to get a replacement
x-fader which you can switch from +3 to +6 to +10 in order to more
accurately beat match.  The new vestax table that is similar to the
technics is realyl cool looking too . . . much more so than technics,
although they're sweet too.  Other vestax tables have backwards mode,
digital pitch adjustment, dual start stop buttons, etc etc.

As far as mixers go, it depends what you want to mix.  like photon
said, numarks are good mixers and well worth the money.  They're good
for scratching have nice features (transformers, channel kill
switches, etc)and work pretty well (I had one for a year, with only
having to replace the x-fader once after being used in the main room
at life is but a dream).  If you have the oney and wanna scratch a lot
though . . . go vestax.  Me and frankie g just got two of their new
t-shaped mixers, and they're great.  everything is smooth and their
built great.  They are also incorporating their innovative attitude to
mixers, trying to come out with new stuff all the time (hamster
switch, adjustable cross fader cuts, etc)

> afford them. i have stanton 500s still =/ and they suck ass.

Personally I like them . . .

> headphones. i can't recommend any for durability (since something

Headphones . . . lemme tell you the way to go: Optimus lv-20 from
radio shack.  they cost $40 and are great.  I got a pair planning to
return them (nobody brought any to NOVA) and kept them they were so
nice.  You can also get a warranty for like $20 more so that if
anything goes wrong in the next year they'll replace them (and they
mean ANYTHING).  high output, clear, nice base.  I've never been able
to turn them up loud enough to overload them either!

well, that was fun . . . It's nice to be able to know all this stuff
cause I remember a year or so ago when me and frankie were asking the
same shit.

and this page, "techno sucks":

http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Alley/4269/

is even stranger than the "rave hate page". it makes no sense and it's
not about techno music, it's about how they hate stuff like the spice
girls and the macarena and they think it's techno music. so it's kind
of funny i guess.

let's lay down the law right fucking now;

only an ass would say something like you just said. and before anyone
jumps down my throat, yes, i want EVERYONE to read this. and remember,
i was spinning when most of you were still in diapers.

the technics 1200SLmkII is nothing special whatsoever. dont bother trying
to tell me otherwise, because it's a cold hard fact. the only real changes
to the 1200SLmkII from the mkI and original 12SL's that i spin on is the
fucking pitchbend, a bit of the layout, and that's it. 

if you can get 12SL's for $150/ea, go for it. don't ask me for mine tho,
they're staying here. the mkII is nothing special.

i have spun on one of the new vestax tables recently. they're working on
some nice stuff, but it's not as nice as it could be or should be. i would
buy a numark over vestax, because they're mostly experimenting with the
stuff now. numark is going with tried and true stuff. 'sides, it's
cheaper, and just as good.

uhm, i better not get into mixers. my choices, as always, in order, are;
ketyra audio, vestax, numark, and mtx. numark has nice ones, so does
vestax, so does mtx. get what works for you; not what works for somebody
else. i suggest the mtx mx3000 because it's a nice mid-range mixer that
you can learn with. you can figure out what works for you, and go from
there.

stanton 500al's are fucking broadcast carts. not for fucking spinning like
a maniac. jeezuzchrist. stanton even says this.

you know what the optimus lv-20's are, don't you?

koss td-70's. i used to use td-75's and td-70's exclusively. they are nice
NICE *NICE* headphones for the money. impossible to break 'em. and koss is
unbelievable with their warranty. you ship 'em broken headphones, they'll
ship back new ones. no charge. the only other headphones i use are koss
td-60's, because they're much lighter. easier when i'm doing synth work,
because i'm bouncing around like a madman.

since they stopped making them 50 years ago or whatever, you couldn't
find em even if you wanted to. no one's tryin to tell you that your
funky tech 12's aren't good, its just that no one is even aware of
their existence cause they are a rare breed.

i think it is important to mention that the main reason i endorse the
1200's is that they are going to be what you are spinning on when you
spin out. it doesn't matter if you have a set of pimped out decks @
home, if you aren't used to spinning on 1200's, you're probably gonna
fuck up.

> stanton 500al's are fucking broadcast carts. not for fucking
spinning like
> a maniac. jeezuzchrist. stanton even says this.

maybe not, but they work for me + just about everyone else. they are
reccommended by djs from all over the place for scratching/rigorous
backcuing and stuff... and even though you were spinnin @ whatever
raves were called back when i was learning how to crawl and suckin on
my mom's titties, it doesn't change the fact that the general
consensus is that trackmasters really aren't worth the money, and
ortofons are even worse. if anyone doesn't believe me go somewhere
other than this forum. you'll see.

> you know what the optimus lv-20's are, don't you?

a pretty nice pair of headphones that'll take whatever you dish out to
em without overloading, are available just about anywhere, have a
nifty volume slider built into the cord, a an optional 3 year
warranty, and are excellent for djing?

I liked what Teknova did at the boat storage for Creation. They had strings of
lights on top of the port-o-jons. That was a good idea. Now all they need is
to put a couple dozen  Stick-ups in those things.

OK, here's the list so far for the Get Freaky 3 Net Meet, scheduled for this
Saturday, November 7th....email me if you wish to be added!
Does anyone know what space is being used yet? Just curious, want to know
where to tell everyone to meet, but until I hear otherwise, I will assume
there will be a main room, and so we will meet TWICE, in front of the dj
tables or main stage, at 2:00pm, and then again at 3:30am. How's that? ;-)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org

Well first of this is my third spawntaneous halloween
show. Of the three this one was the smallest and had
the least amount of people there. Hmmm i wonder why?
Although i was not at the first Suicide this part
seemed to be alot like it. First off it was 20$ w/
costume 25$ w/o. None of the headliners on the flyer
were at the party. Which was not much of a surprise.
I had heard all week that the party was going to be in
the storage warehouse next to u4ia. The night of the
party it was changed to the skating rink. I dont know
the reason for the change, but it was fine by me.
Before the party we went to a 7 keg costume party in
Lakewood. So we didnt make it to the skating place till
about 1am. As we walked in my friend neil was spinning
w/ pureplex. They sounded really good. If you never
heard them you might want to check out there
site.http://www.pureplex.com
They have a few sample mp3's from there cd. Which i
picked up at the show for 10$. Next up was Funkian
Tribe who i haven't seen since halloween last year.
Then came Swamp (i think), who was great and i also had
not seen since last year. Then Evilectrcians were up
and they sounded good.  They sounded Way better than at
4:20  They were followed by Rolando out of det. His set
was very tight. Then came Bone (det) who also had a
great set that seemed to last forever.  The last
(surprise) headliner was Terrance Parker also out of
Det. Last up was dj urban which we stayed for 1/2 his
set.

I think this party was only promoted in the cleveland
area w/ simple b&w photo copy flyers. The vibe was
intimate but good.I would guess there were 300-500
people there. The dj's kind of hung out back stage and
were really cool. I didn't go up and talk to any of
them but my friend gave Terrance a ride to his hotel.
He told me Terrance was a nice guy and he had fun at
the party.

 All around this party was mediocre at best, but all my
local friends were there so it made for a good time.
The lighting was rather weak but the music kind of made
up for it. I didnt hear any complaints all night so i
guess most people had an ok time. I
had fun at this pary, but i still wished i had been at
Majick w/ all you guys.


Ray

p.s. I for got to mention Gank's nice set sandwiched in
there somewhere. Also i went to pureplex.com and it was
down. It was working fine yesterday. So you might want
to try it another day.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

Sat Nov 28                        ENERGIZE                               DC

U L T R A W O R L D 
in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year history.
It is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for it to do to
the dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond.  It will be held in
the massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in this space
before, none will compare to the excellence of Energize.

The main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one
wide-open, high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set
Energize apart from our previous events is that we have now been approved
to use the basement! Don't think basement like dark and dingy though,
this basement has ceilings of 40', and makes the biggest dance clubs on
the East Coast look like efficiency apartments in Manhattan.  Plus it's
divided up into rooms of various sizes. 
For the first time at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all
with full on concert level production in both sound and lighting.  

All performers listed below are confirmed.  The four rooms of Energize
will
be:

The Main Arena:   We will fill this space with the best sound system we
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of lasers,
projection screens and intelligent lights.  The lineup is one of the best
we have ever presented, a true blend of the most prevalent styles of
electronic dance music.  From hard techno, to trance, to funky breaks, to
fun party music, the main room at Energize is going to be all that and
more.  The performers are:

CARL CRAIG performing live as
Paperclip People  Planet E Records, Detroit
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI  Matsuri Productions  London/Tokyo
DOC MARTIN  Los Angeles
ICEY  Zone, Orlando
SCOTT HENRY  Buzz, DC
T1000  Generator/DJax, Detroit
NIGEL RICHARDS  611 Records, Philadelphia

You may have seen that Uberzone was previously listed in the main room.
They
had said they were available, but then decided to cancel all bookings for
the
rest of the year to make time to write new music. 

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena:  In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the
undisputed
champions of the U.K. scene.  This area will be hosted by 2 Tuff
productions
of DC.  The lineup is:

GROOVERIDER  Sony, Prototype, U.K.
FABIO  U.K.
MC GQ  the U.K.'s premier MC
DARA  Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY  Platinum, Philadelphia
AK1200  Orlando
DB  Breakbeat Science, NYC
SLANT  2 Tuff, DC
ENTITY  Ultraworld
FLUID  Sonic Soul, Baltimore
MC DUB2  Philadelphia

The Deep House Arena:  This third area, also in the basement, is bigger
then any dance club on the East Coast.  It will be hosted by
Philadelphia's Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long.  The performers are:

DERRICK CARTER  Chicago
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION  Universal Language, U.K.
FEELGOOD  Charm City Records, Baltimore
KENNY GLASGOW  Toronto
O'KEEFE  Circle, Philly
ROB PAINE  Circle, Philly
SEAN THOMAS  Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena:  The smallest area of the event, but still bigger
then the main room at most clubs!  This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
respected Sonic Soul crew, and will feature the downtempo side of
electronic music.  You can dance if you want to, with performers:

TIM "LOVE" LEE  Tummy Touch, U.K.
PETE LAWRENCE  the Big Chill, U.K.
WE performing live  Asphodel, NYC
LOVEGROVE  Sonic Soul
DJ C  Toneburst, Boston
RHOMBUS  Sonic Soul

What makes this event even more exciting, is the fact that it will be a
collaborative effort between Ultraworld, Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.
While Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction for
the event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically manage
the areas of music they are most interested in.  What that means for you
is that you get the highest quality of production and care going into
every aspect of the event.

Tickets will be on sale in the DC/Baltimore area on September 30, and
should be at all of the outlets by October 3, and will be broken down as
follows:

There will be 1000 tickets sold for only $20!   So if you know you're
going to go, you have the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low
price.  We are accepting orders for these tickets now, or you can wait
until they are at the outlets. If you'd like to mail order your ticket,
send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER ONLY, made out to Ultraworld Productions for $20
per ticket ordered.  Send it to:

Ultraworld Productions
3042 O'Donnell St
Baltimore, MD  21224

After those 1000 are gone the price will be $25 up to and including
October 31.  

On November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that
price even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets.  Admission at the
gate will be $35.

Also, we are working with the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend.
For those of you who may not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held
every Friday by DJ's Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt.  It plays host to
the world's top DJ's and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of
the best in the country.  When you purchase your ticket to Energize, there
will be a stub which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for
only $5  (Note: Tickets purchased through Ticketmaster will not have this
stub, but Buzz will honor the $5 admission).   Consider coming to DC on
Friday, and making a long stay of it.  We'll post hotel and travel info on
this site in the weeks to come. 

To stay in DC, try these hotels:
Phoenix Park Hotel (closest to venue)	202.638.6900
Best Western (closest to Buzz & afterparty)	202.488.7500
Holiday Inn				202.383.3838

When you've had your turkey and you're done with the family, 
the place to be is Washington, D.C. for Ultraworld's ENERGIZE!!!

well this is the minus thingy of plus eight.  they mail us once or three
times a month.....   mostly seems harmless, but i dont understand what they
do exactly and havent put much thought into it.  that would involve reading
web pages and stuff.
i guess its worth it to keep on here since they sometimes announce webcasts
and stuff.  
the house4all thing was someones bright idea of a global rave mailing list,
you mailed that one list and it mailed to all the other ones.   i think
thats what you're talking about?  bloody mess tho!

I've looked at the m-nus webpage and I wasn't impressed. like, they had
some good design and all, but it was real low on content, which kind of
defeats the purpose for me...

Well folks it's me Jesus. My AOL account went apeshit on me (what a
surprise) so i'm now gonna use this name. I've been out of the loop for a
good 2 weeks so it'll take me awhile to get my groove back! anyways
remember CANADA69 is temporarily not being used by me and i'll be on this
name from now on.

Jesus

John(House of Styles) asked me to post this about "DAWN" as you know the
party will be at the crane building.
the owners of the crane want to charge 3$ for parking. John doesn't want
this but there reason for doing this
is to pay someone to clean up the parking lots and surrounding area after
"DG" they said it took them 2 days to clean up all the fliers.

John is trying to get them not to charge for parking if he does this he is
responsible for cleaning up.
and I don"t think is fair for him to have that responsibility.

So, please if he gets them to not charge for parking use trash cans,say
something to others about littering.
even pick up stuff to ease his burdens. if not there will probly not be a
next time for this space or we will have to pay to park

thanks,
Don

W3rd!
If I am at party til 8 am or so during the end of the last DJ set i will
try to pitch as many water bottles etc as i can, and its fun while there
is still music.  It all goes hand in hand with good plur, and can be done
so quickly if a bunch of peeps get together and do this.  I never really
camp out along a wall like most of the really messy ones do, but if you do
this you should especially take note. :-)

yeah i mean that's another good idea.

its another reason i went to Magick - i love having events that are easy
to get to.  i just took a bus and walked from town, then in the morning 
took a bus home.  if you live in the city, that's the way to go.
its not a far walk from the bus or train station at all either.

About cleaning up - yeah its a real bitch how dirty rave spaces get.
People need to just be more respectful.  One thing i find though, after
cleaning up for about a half dozen big raves, is that people don't throw
away their water bottles.  If there's anything you can do to help - either
save your water bottle and reuse it, or throw it away in a garbage can.

I can't tell you how many 1/2 full bottles i threw away after DYNAMO, but
it was more than two full garbage bags.

Jeff and I filled five garbage bags with water bottles near the end of
Magick. But I didn't see any trash cans around that people could have
thrown them in. Having liberal access to trash cans could help ravers be
cleaner. :)

OK, here's the list so far for the Get Freaky 3 Net Meet, scheduled for this
Saturday, November 7th....email me if you wish to be added!
I have just learned from someone that the space will be across the street from
Grand Poo Bas records in Lakewood (the Phantasy? Wow!) I will assume there
will be a main room, and so we will meet TWICE, in front of the dj tables or
main stage, at 2:00am, and then again at 3:30am. How's that? ;-) -Casey-

OK, questions

1) Date?
2) Number of people expected? (Trout, how many active people do we have
here?)
3) I say we come up with a $contribution amount and if you send that in
you will have entry to the party plus a guest.  The money will go to pay
for the space and any left over will go towards sound. I'm guessing
around $10 a person. Any other ideas on that?
4) Is anyone going to complain if the party is in Pittsburgh?  I have a
space if we want to have it here.
5) Who's spinning?  Are there more interested DJs than would fill up 10
one hour slots?

Let's get the space/date issue ironed out.  That way I can confirm it
and start working on the rest.

yes, that is the venue.  in fact it says on the flyers that the venue WILL=
 be the Phantasy complex, which is several small little nightclubs that are=
 located in one big building on the corner of Detroit Ave and W116th, which=
 you can get to by just getting off I-90 at W 117th, heading north on 117th=
 to Detroit (there is a big Medic Drugstore on the corner of that=
 intersection) and then turning left onto Detoit and shooting over one=
 block.  i can't imagine that they will bring in port-a-potties fo rthis =
 one considering that the bathrooms are already big enough shit holes that=
 there's no point in closing them off for the event.  unfortunately there is=
 not a lot of open dance space in any of those clubs.  that will be=
 something to see though, a party at the phantasy.  for those that are=
 hungry when they leave, i highly reccomend the 24 hour joint on detroit=
 that is on the other side of 117th avenue, just to the right of that Medic=
 I was talking about.  it's called "My Friends".
bye.  steve

yay! it's cheese.  i am at boston university, my friend dances there
(axis, big "cool" club), and she gets free add for a few people.  plus, my
leg is still prone to decay after my repetitive stress injury during
intergalactic circus and from dancing on it while injured at subsequential
dance mania events. i am trying to save my legs for SHIFT in toronto. 
they commented on my dancing when i was there before.  man in tight
synthetics exclaims how "cool" i dance and asks if i want to be
guestlisted..so, they are all about image and getting people in for free.
it's a cool environment, just full of people that haven't caught the vibe
and are worried about raising their pulse above 120.

it's all about suppressing your rave-cravings,

Andy

I guess I don't have a problem with having the party in 
Pittsburgh, and I live in Cleveland.
(If we can get a space, go for it!)
However, $10 is a bit over the agreed price.
It will not be a huge rave, it'll be juuust right!

even tho i went off the other nite about how the space for MAGICK was way
small and shitty... i have to say that i had a GREAT time at MAGICK... and i
cant think of a better way to spend a HOLLOWEEN...

This party had one of the most increadible vibes i've ever witnessed..
(especially at a pittsburgh party)... i guess that was partially due to it
being HOLLOWEEN and all.. but still, i was pleasently suprised at the
results of the party... i mean, i knew the party itself wouldnt completely
suck (until i found out that it was taking place at the paint-ball centre...
but i really dont want to go into that again... lemme just appologize one
last time for mouthing off so badly the other nite... please forgive me :D)

anyway.. my friends and i got to the spot around 11ish (after stopping by
KINKO'S in downtown to make laminates... donny works there, so its free..)
and noticed this LONG ASS line which streached down the block (which is not
so bad in itself until one realises that the party is like 4 flights of
stairs up.. and so is the line)... but we've all seen FAR worse lines b4 and
so resolved to just wait it out...

the wait wasnt bad at all.. there were lots of happy party kids on line all
excited for the party and lots of great costumes to admire... i was happy to
see taht some kids went pretty far out as far as their costumes go.. and it
wasnt just a bunch of raver-fairies.. (ie kids in teh raver uniform w\ extra
glitter and strap-on-back-pack-type wings) ... and not everyone had big
pants on, which was a nice change... the line moved pretty quickly due to
the fact taht not everyone was strip searched.. (there was only one door so
if they had done that we would have been on line till the party finished...)
i'd say we were inside after about an hr... maybe a little more.. which,
once u think of it.. is not so bad...

i should mention, that when we first arrived these 2 little girls w\ a frown
on their faces explained that the main room had yet to be openned... this
made me laugh... a kind of "i told u so" feeling hung in teh air as my
friends looked at me like..  maybe we should go home... we ended up
staying.. and i'm WAY glad we did...

the music was very good for most of the evening.. i kind of dont really like
house... so i share in the sentiment that there was just TOO MUCH HOUSE at
this party... but most sets were really good... which i can respect.. and i
danced for most of the evening.. which in itself is an idication taht i must
have enjoyed it...

Doctor Trance spun an excellent set.. as did Felix .. but the best set IMO
was the last dj of the evening who spun in the main room.. i;m not sure who
it is.. if u kids can shed some light on that i'd really apreciate it...

i didnt spend too much time in the smaller room.. way too hot.. but there
was some good music from over there as well... (i just saw no reason to stay
in such a confined space when there was kickass music in the main room
...which was MUCH bigger and cooler (temperature-wize)....

it seemed like the entire midwest was at this party.. whcih was great b/c i
got to see kids that hadnt been around for a while and that i had kind of
lost touch w\... everyone seemed to be in very high spirits and really
enjoying themselves.. i wasntsure if i was gonna go to get freaky 3 this
comming weekend.. but after MAGICK, i really REALLY want to... (ohio parties
kick such ass!!)

seeing all teh kids from west virhinia who i had bet at EQUINOX a while back
was another highlight... (hi kids!! :D) i have most of their e-mails and
stuff but i'm such a bad pen-pall... but partying together is much better
than reading lame-ass e-mails...

the worst thing abt the space was that it was covered in paint -- wet
paint -- and so u couldnt reaally touch anywhere w\ out gettng this
disgusting slimey shit all over yourself.. i felt kinda bad for all the kids
who wanted to roll.. b/c there was no really clean spot to just sit and
chill.. i guess it didnt bother people that much (the overwhelmiong majority
of the kids there looked like they were rolling face at one point or
another) ... i stayed sober the whole nite although i had strongly thought
of taking something myself.. which was good b/c i've been kinda confused
about whether or not i want to continue partying sober or not

the past couple times i've walked around at parties and seen people rolling
face and getting backrubs  and i was always kinda like.. hmmm.. maybe i
should be rolling right now.. almost w\ this kind of jelousy that made me
feel stupid for wanting to party sober all the time... but this time i was
just like.. oh look, they're rolling.. how nice for them... :D i didnt even
want to roll any more...

(i guess i could devote a whole other post to this so i'll just kinda switch
topics... but it was cool to know that i didnt mind being sober any more...)

I didn’t so much mind the dirt and nast at this party (one should expect to
be somewhat dirty after a party) but I could have done w\ out the paint…

I ended up pretty much loosing donny and claudia for most of the evening.. I
was so bisy walking around feeding off the kickass vibe in the space that it
didn’t really matter that I had lost them. At least until the morning after
when I found out that donny got all depressed at the party at some point and
was kind of looking for me… so now I feel like a bad friend b/c I should
have been there.. he doesn’t mind so much tho b/c he knows I like to roam
around at parties and I never stay in one place…

I spent most of my time in front of the speaker in the main room w\ that
cute little 15 year old kid (his name is Karl… in case u were all
wondering…) all nite long people would come up to me and ask: “how old is
that kid???” personally.. I love seeing younger kids at parties… I was 15
myself when I went to what I guess would be considered a [rave] for the
first time… I think its so cool to party w\ “the next generation of kids” u
know??

And he was all nice and friendly… and idealistic about stuff.. I mean.. he
was rolling.. and it sucks to see a 15 year old who gets all fucked up..but
we were talking abt all these things.. and I can say that he;s not a
crack-head … yet (MAGICK was only his second [rave]) so he;s kind of a
newbie… infortunately.. I can totally see him turning into this big
crackhead.. (its pretty easy for it to happen if one;s been partying that
long…) so I just want to try to have this posative affect on him.. I’m
hoping he’ll stay away from all the god-damned shadiness… but it kinda too
early to tell…

The worst part abt this party… was that I met a bunch of great kids as they
were getting into their cars and leaving.. at the end of the party… that
always fucking happens to me… I just hate the feeling that I’m never gonna
see any of these kids again and I just spent the whole evening at a party w\
them… but didn’t know they were there.. grrr!!! (its quite frustrating)

I guess I gotta go to GET FREAKY 3 this weekend.. and hopefullyi’ll run into
some of them there… too bad that shit costs 30$ at the door (w\ m&m’s) …way
expensive..!!!

I just wanted to thank kelly & rob for this excellentparty.. and I’m real
sorry I was all mean and nasty the nite b4 the party… I actually ran into
rob for a second while I was on the stairs (on line for the party ..) but he
was in a hurry so I didn’t get to talk w\ him hoping I’d run into him later…
which I didn’t.. again.. I apologize… I guess I should have kept my mouth
shut… (I’ll know better next time :D)

I’ll do most of the shout outs privately since this post is like all long or
whatever… but basically thanks to everyone who made this nite so much fun
for me.. its not one I will soon forget…

xoxo

Costas.

Well, it seems like the schedule of things going on is pretty full till
the end of the year, and late december isn't always the greatest time to
have something (although a week or two before christmas would be cool by
me).  So i think maybe early-mid january would be good.

Fri-Sat's in January are 8-9,15-16,22-23,29-30.
So if we're picking a date at random, why not January 15 or 16?

I'm guesstimating 400-500, maybe 600 capacity would be more than enough.
Of course, with just list DJs...not to knock anyone (including myself),
we might be safe with the smaller end of that.

Do i understand you right that you're saying people on the list send you
or whoever the central figure in this is (i'm cool with Kelly if she's up
for doing it) $10 each to pay for the space/sound/etc? 

If we can get enough folks to dedicate to this, cool.  

If 100 people put in $10 - basically the same as pre-paying for a rave - 
that's 1000.  Then whatever we need to cover other costs we could ask for
at the door, depending on how much we need - $1 or $5 or something.
If we need money fronted for pre-costs, I can help in some way.

No complaints here, but i feel for the Cle kids.

> 5) Who's spinning?  Are there more interested DJs than would fill up 10

I think there are more than 10 djs/acts if we're going the linear one
dj/hour with one room setup.  I think if we can hook up the real-audio
thing, then we should do it.  Andy the Pooh, where are you??  
Otherwise, I'm sure we could hook something up.  Todd & Frankie and me &
Tom tend to tagteam, and Ratfink was taggin' with Tom the other
night...maybe we could just have all the jungle kids do a big 2-hour
tagteam.  Chaos my friends, pure madness that would be.

Anyway, that's my thoughts for now.

Let the posting frenzy begin.

Hey -- I was a raver fairy!  But I wasn't so cheap as to just strap on
the wings.  I had a long, flowing blue dress with long flappy sleeves;
and my wand was supposed to be a giant roll on a stick (I made the
pill into a 'crown.'  Ah, remember the days of crowns?)

i can start an alias at hyperreal just for discussing the party, so as to

my vote is for youngstown ... but if nobody can find a space there then 
we should take Kelly up on her generous offer

as for admission... $5 presale per person would be better than $10 and 
bring a guest...society is always "punishing" people with no friends ... 
let's not make it worse on them   ; )

The best date for me would be after January, probably in 
February, but don't worry about me, my schedule is always
fucked up. I would say the best time would definitely be
sometime after the New Year.

This sounds like a good idea.

I would prefer for the party to be in a central location, 
but that is under "ideal" conditions. I understand that
spaces are very difficult to find and secure, and so I'd 
be willing to compromise for convenience sake, even though 
I am 3 hours away ;) How about we have the planning party/bbq/
whatever here in Cleveland like someone on this list discussed earlier?
I think that we should try our best to ensure that the organ-
izational process for this party does not become regionally
disproportionate or dominated. But I am also open to other 
ideas/suggestions.

I think that is a great idea, Jamie.

Also, I was thinking about how I envision this party, and 
I am hoping that we will be able to pull it off in such a way
that the party is not only a "rave" and a place for people to 
party together, but also a place for people to actually socialize
and get to know one another. Any suggestions on how we could 
provide for this kind of atmosphere?


That is all for now,


Kate

Yay! It's so nice to see Pittsburgh's music scene growing -- in all
genres. Be glad that there are promoters who are willing to take a chance
on throwing events here -- and SUPPORT them.

Just thought i would let everyone know that there is a
small article on 187 in this month's Spin magazine. It
talks about her recent sex change w/ It Shows b4 and
after shots. It also speaks highly of her dj/producing
skills.

But it just can't be helped we are considered having as our sole pupose,
annoying the damn mopey goths. ;)

I think since DAWN will be a similarly big party, I am very curious and
excited to see how it will turn out. First reminder to get there very early
to hear list member DaMofo spin Happy Hardcore!!  It's been awhile since I
heard some good hhc @ a party.

Speaking of Dawn, check out

the flyer is hand drawn I hear and just yummilicious. :-)

i agree...i have like, no friends that go to raves.  well, i have one, but she's on the list, so she'll have to bring someone else non-list, and that leaves me with nobody!  don't punish me for not knowing anyone that goes to raves!

Actually, it is located on the corner of Detroit Avenue and Hird Avenue. "My
Friends", the restaurant, is located near the corner of W116th and Detroit
(which is only two whole blocks apart anyway). So definitely take Steve's
advice and head over to My Friend's  afterward or whatever to eat, I grew up
within this four block radius, and go here quite often myself. See you all
there!!!!! -Casey

I believe that Rob (Discomafia) was being facetious there... He really didnt
MEAN that it was cheese, he was trying to point out that because they are so
widely known as rave dj's, they couldnt be cheese...anyway, I am sure you
figured that out. ;-) These two are AWESOME, and should NOT be missed, they
will be here in Cleveland on Friday, the 4th of December, at Trilogy, which no
one should miss if possible... -Casey-

Well, I can see your point parking in a different section...but I would act the same as if i was parking in the other lot by not littering. I'm sure they don't want people littering in their neighbors lots and have them all mad at them.

Basically, littering ANYWHERE is pretty ignorant. So, you do what you know is right.

 loaded with toys, light sticks, and lots of candy and other stuff to make the
 party enjoyable.  i will be printing up some flyers soon, please "E"-mail me

For all who can attend.  We could make this a meeting point to discuss the pb-cle
party.  Sorry non-Pittsburghers.  You're more than welcome, of course.  Don't mean
to make Pitt. the focus.  It's definitely easier for me to work on something here
that's going to happen here.

I'm willing.  I promise not to vacation with the money.  I say we start
getting the money in asap.  This will no doubt be time consuming.  I'll post a
list of those I've recieved money from.  If we get 100 people at $10 that
should do it.  Say half of that for the space and the other half for sound.
We can do ghetto lights, I say.  Also, if for some reason there's money left
over, make a contribution to a cause?

Someone should take over the DJ selection/time-slot thing.  A non-DJ I
suppose.  I'm not sure I want that job.  The first thing would be to boil the
list down to 10 slots.  Someone is going to feel slighted but welcome to the
realm of party planning.

I heard about this club who had a singles night. they gave everyone a
name tag as they entered the door and they have to wear it the whole
night.  that would be a great way to get ppl to talk to each other...

oh whatever, fuck them.  i hope water was 3 dollars in dixie cups and
everyone had a shitty time.  the funny thing is that my other friend that
works there gave me a card that gets free admission and line privledges
for every thursday until it gets revoked for something stupid. so, i could
have went while i was complaining about it last night.  i'm sure there was
a reason for me to not be there...

Yea, i have no probs with broadcasting our party. in fact, i'd feel like an ass if i didn't. ;)  the only prob i can foresee lies in the venue. As long as there is a phoneline avialable that i can use all night long, i'll just set up and send it off to the world. If there isn't a phone line tho, i'd have to use a wireless data link, and that could add some cost onto the broadcasting thing. But naturally, i'd be willing to do it for what it costs me. :)

Anybody hear about this...I can't remember exactly what the name of the

Actually... the instrumental first appeared as a white lable.
Then it was released on the now infamous Peppermint Jam.
Then the white lables re-surfaced.
Then it showed up on AM:PM.
Then Horny 98 showed up (i forget what lable).

The C5 has always been on AM:PM, and the last shipment I got in
it was on another label, listed as domestic, packaged as import, and priced
in between the two.

OK, here's the list so far for the Get Freaky 3 Net Meet, scheduled for
TONIGHT,  Saturday, November 7th....email me if you STILL wish to be added!
The space will be the Phantasy Nightclub building, on the corner of Hird
Avenue and W 117th street (coming in from I-90, get off on W117th and head
North).  I will assume there will be a main room, and so we will meet TWICE,
in front of the dj tables or main stage, at 2:00am, and then again at 3:30am.
How's that? ;-) -Casey-

Well maybe this would be a good opportunity to all the losers out
there who don't have friends who go to raves (joke, don't get swole)
to bring along a friend who has never been to a rave to meet all your
other friends from the list?  It probably won't be as scary as a full
blown rave either . . . so it's perfect!

<< 1) Date?
         First of all, how many students are there on the list?  If there are
alot, then perhaps we should go over a time where us students will have time
to dedicate themselves to this party.  Like around Spring Break? Mid to late
March, or April?  It would be warm, and it would give everyone plenty of time
to get resources together.  Just a sugestion.  I am a student, but I will work
with everyone else.

 2) Number of people expected? (Trout, how many active people do we have
 here?)  Ummm...... 

 3) I say we come up with a $contribution amount and if you send that in
 you will have entry to the party plus a guest.  The money will go to pay
 for the space and any left over will go towards sound. I'm guessing
 around $10 a person. Any other ideas on that? 
	What about estimations on space cost, lights, and sound first?  Then the list
members can contribute cash after we get a figure.  I dont know about any of
that, but what about anyone who has set up parties before?  Also if we work
with list members, a discount cost, or a freebee?  Its up to you guys on that
one.

4) Is anyone going to complain if the party is in Pittsburgh?  I have a
 space if we want to have it here.
	How many cities does this list go through?  Cleveland, Cincy, Pitts,
Columbus, Youngstown, Akron, and I am sure a few more.  What about in
Cleveland?  It is pretty much a center point from most of those
cities....excluding Cincy. Unfortunately no matter where this party is, the
Cincy kidz will have to drive a long time no matter what.

 5) Who's spinning?  Are there more interested DJs than would fill up 10
 one hour slots?
	I think the idea of a few Tag teams would be awesome!  Plus that would give a
few other DJ's an opertunity to perform.  All I ask is that there be 1 Hard or
Acid or Progressive Trance.  We should have a wide range of House, Jungle,
Trance and whatnot.  Just as long as nobody exludes eachothers tastes ya know?

This is Dan, I'm not on the list ATM so I can't post this, but if you
could... Yeah I was sitting in my car at 4:50pm waiting for my
girlfriend to get off work so I could give her a ride home... and I'm
kicking radio Carson... I hear this voice  come on..."this is bla bla
bla from radio carson, I've got a special guest in the studio tonight
who would like to have a word with you, and here he is..." then some
dorky dude came on  "This is agent blah blah of the FCC office in
Philly, This station is operating under multiple violations of the FCC
rules, I'm going to shut it down, and confiscate all equipment." Then
you hear some trancy song mix in for a few secs, then total silence...
then like 15 seconds later you hear nothing but static...

bleah, I do believe it's not ever going to be back up... It has to suck
to get all the equipment confiscated... He just got the Stereo kicking
right too...

Depressed, Dan K

OK, here's where everyone that wants to be in on the party needs to write.
This will give us a number to work with when determining cost.

Either Trout or AndyThePooh will set up a seperate list soon (I hope :)) just for posts
about the party.  When they do everyone who plans on contributing and coming should send
a post so we can get a number.

If we use the space in Pittsburgh it will be about $600, possibly less.  Sound will
probably be free and lights we can do ourselves.  The space is our biggest cost.

I've given it a shot.  This will be cake. We just need to know how many people want to
come to this thing.

I was assuming that if you make a contribution to the cost of the party, you get in (with
a guest?).  We won't be charging money at the door.  Unless we could use that as a
collection time for t-shirt money or something.  It will be a rare opportunity to have
everyone in one space.

I don't care where it is.  If we want the space here, we have it.  If anyone in Ohio can
arrange something else that people are more for, cool.

Andy needs all interested DJs to send him a tape.  He will put them on his web site and
we can all go there and vote.  Get your tapes to him asap.

I have a feeling that musically this party will be anti-magick!!  All you hard heads.

because of a growing unsatisfaction with my computer, my work,

i am moving to the koga mountains to train with hatori hanzo, to learn

see the web site for more info:

sho is no more.

i am truly regret all of the problems that this may cause...but it has to be

hello.

i am beginning to become excited and concerned about the party.  i want to
help set up the lights...this is my dream.  often, i see fruit and stars
projected onto the floor/wall/surface as mean techno is playing.  it
totally inhibits you from going to the fabeled third-rave-level that i
described at the beginning of the summer.  another totally radical idea:
let's complile a list of our favourite chizzoons PRE-party and then
EVERYONE can have an plusgood (possibly double plusgood) time.  each of us
should get like one song er sum shit.

ahh yes, tonight i am going to my first non-commericial rave in boston.
it is a hardcore house party in a shitty neighborhood (sanctuary!).
seriously, after living in disneyworld (i mean bu campus) you really want
to move to the ghetto.  all carbon-based life is equidistant from each
other...it's just not natural.  some would say anatural.  i will tell you
how the party goes.  ewww shit, one of the girls "coordinating" it is from
pittsburgh and went to winchester-thurstmack.  we shall see if pittsburgh
really throws down out of the environment.

my room is a studio, it's the funkiest place i kno-o-ow...
my room is a stu-dii-oo<heavy dipthong>-o.

Andy

Me and Brian from sphere have been working on the entire space problem for the pb-cle-party. There are two possibles in Y-town, one is a bar that could easily accomidate 300-400, if the party is strictly for list members and their guests (which is what i think most prefer) this should be fine. the other has legal implications that brian is still looking into. My friend that owns the bar has 3 lawyers working on how a party of this nature can be done without police intervention,(remember freak-e, phunked up, and weird science ?) it has two large rooms, and the main room has a phat dance floor and a few other nice features. The tenative budget I have worked out would be about $5
a person, maybe less. this covers space, lights, and sound + everyone who has something else to contribute should let it be known. The owner wants to check out
what a party is like first tho, so I'm taking him to
love of life in akron next friday, but he's kewl and
seems like he would be down for it. So, if y-town is 
still a possible location for the list party - I think
it can be done no-problem. If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the space e-mail me privatly.

OK, here's the final list for the Get Freaky 3 Net Meet, scheduled for
TONIGHT,  Saturday, November 7th....
The space will be the Phantasy Nightclub building, on the corner of Hird
Avenue and Detroit Avenue(coming in from I-90, get off on W117th and head
North, then take a left at Detroit Avenue, it'll be on your right at the next
corner).  I will assume there will be a main room, and so we will meet TWICE,
in front of the dj tables or main stage, at 2:00am, and then again at 3:30am.
How's that? ;-) -Casey-

What about the place where 2/3rd's was held?  That one should be just

geez, i'm sitting in my room totally exhausted after a fabulous night
we had this hip hop fest here at my school and it was mind blowing.
forget get freaky and the pharcyde, we had the animal crackers from cinci on=
 5 decks, plus three or four mc's from lyrical terrorists from cinci, plus=
 dj sleepyhead from oberlin, plus half of twin glox, plus madd moe and a=
 bunch of mc's from 314/black pearl entertainment...it was unbelieveable. =
 too much dj'ing and mc'ing for one night, and even some rad ass break=
 dancing from a couple of guys from youngstown...the anonymous breakers. =
 the whole thing was four hours of absolute ecstacy for me.  freestyles and=
 battles and just crazy shit.  it's nice to be sitting here and just=
 unwinding to bill evans.
night night all.

FREE MIXTAPE for listmembers!
(strings attached are optional)

i am sending out free copies of my mixtape to any listmember who asks
for one, unless you've already got one, sorry. =] it is primarily hard
techno, but also has a little electro + house. you are welcome to send
me a mixtape in exchange (of anything i don't have, i'm not too picky,
although i'd be really happy to get some hard dark evil techstep) but
that's optional. the list of tapes + CDs i have (68 of them) is on
this page: http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Chamber/3706/index.html
go to the link in the page for track listings (including my tape). if
you want copies of any other tapes, just tell me, but i will need an
equal number in return. mine is the only free one. ratings/disclaimers
are included on the page so you are not suprised by a somewhat
imperfect tape; i didn't rate mine (which would be egotistical) + it's
not perfect, but only a few small mistakes. sorry about the
amateur/ghetto appearance of the page. my knowledge of html is next to
nothing + i had to use the free geocities page editor.
shipping shouldn't take more than 2 weeks (the rate of my paychecks;
my bank account is empty).

yes, this is probably the first revue...i'm home now....early (as usual)
it's like 5:00am...most people are still there...
so, here is the revue:

Plus's-
Phantom 45, Jungle room, i got in, lots of smiling faces, i remembered my
M+M's, Jungle room, i got to talk to phantom 45, Jungle room, i got to see
like 5 minutes of pharcide.

Minus's-
too crowded, hot, no danceing room, slow moving crowds, the staff treated
everyone like cattle (yelling at us and sticking us with cattleprods), not
enough candy, some of my friends not geting in, too crowded.

over all i thing this was a good party..i havn't been out in a long time (60+
hours a week at work)...so it was a good first back for me.  i still didn't
meet very many people from the list...like 2 maybe? hmmm....hopefully there'll
be more sightings of me in the weeks to come...

-junglekid4

P.S. my friends food is geting progressively worse, i think.

P.P.S.  i'm half asleep right now...so there are probably lots of spelling
	     and gramar mistakes....sorry.

P.P.P.S.g'night

I'm all up for youngstown . . . but last time I was in youngstown the
cops weren't too cooperative or friendly so . . . anyone have any
better assessments of youngstown cops?

I think as long as we keep the party on a small level this should be
cool.  With a space the size we are thinking about and the number of
people that will attend, it should be cool.

later,

ps-kate I've got a message from you in my inbox that I've been trying
to respond to for like 2 monthes . . .

crowded is the key word here folks. you could also call it 

*get squished against a complete stranger's {insert body part here} for 20
minutes while attempting to move anywhere 3.*

i like that one. i wasnt even planning on going but i got off work and was
like, what the heck else am i gonna do? so i pick up danielle and we're off..
after stopping at almost every convenient store on detroit road (dont ask) we
finally found a place to park that wasnt a mile away. i suppose it was about
midnight, the time i usually get to these things if not later, and the line
stretched clear around the building.. luckily, we saw some friends in line and
did the mean thing by *cutting*. :oP we stood there in the cold forever, and
the line didnt move for about an hour. finally dood comes out and says its
sold out. WTF? im so glad i only had to drive 15 minutes to get there.. but
danielle and i arent done trying to get in yet.. we walk up front and somehow
get into the building and come up with a story.. um.. we drove here from
toronto and our rides are inside.. we have no way to get home or anything...
so someone believes us (ha, sucker!) and when we go to pay someone pushes us
thru the line and somehow we end up on the other side.. so we keep walking. so
hahafuckingha we got in and didnt have to pay. woohoo. that sold out shit
doesnt phase us. so we get inside, and the place is packed beyond belief. i
havent been to a party that crowded in i dunno how long. probably never. it
was awful trying to move around.. dont even think about finding anyone you
know.. unless youre somehow miraculously squished against them for 10 minutes
while trying to venture up the stairs to the inferno above.. i liked the room
upstairs that spun jungle though (where the actual phantasy is.. with the
boats and crap) cuz it had nice lighting and good ventillation (damnit i cant
spell this morning) and awesome music and my friends were up there and ive
*always* wanted to be happy and dance in that room with all the boats.. theres
a little compartment towards the back hallway where theres a little cubby in
one of the boats.. they wouldnt let anyone go in it, so i didnt get to fulfill
my other goal.. heh.. just kiddin.. but anyway, this party wasnt the greatest,
but i didnt expect it to be after hearing how crappy it was last year (glad i
had to work that night) but overall i ended up having an ok time.. i got
squished up against phantom 45 for 20 minutes and kept touching his butt,
which is always nice. ;o) i ended up leaving around 4 or something though,
because i finally started getting claustraphobic or however you spell it. the
french fries at "my friends" werent as good as they usually are, but the
interesting people in there to watch yell across the whole place made up for
it in entertainment value. <yawn> im going back to bed.  *erin*

ME.  you'd think the inside breast pocket of your jacket is a safe place to
carry your wallet huh?  well not if you take off that jacket and carry it
around.  my wallet fell out of my jacket last week, with more cash in it than
i care to admit i was carrying.  more cash than i've been in possession of for
a long time.  and it was all i had.  boohoo ;( ','

i wasn't all too excited for get freaky anyways - not after i heard about the
accomodations at last year's event.  how could you just forget about
bathrooms?  that's like forgetting the sound system.  altho you gotta admit,
pharcyde at one of our parties ... that would have been so much fun, if there
was room to see.

promoters nb: book goofy hip-hop acts like pharcyde, young mc, spooky, mc
lyte, jazzy jeff.  some are afraid of hip-hop parties and junglists cos they
attract unwanted "bidness" but if you listen to tracks like #3 "it's one of
those things that make ya go shhhhiot ... oh shit!!!" (i was lisnen to
_bizzarre ride II the pharcyde_ while yall were partyen to it live) you just
gotta luvit.  takes me back to "take it from me, parent's just don't
understand ..." when mcing was all about haven FUN not rhymen about all the
bitches you fucked - it's okay!  you don't gotta dance in ya videos ... 

okay so that paragraph was all over the place but my point is that i think the
only reason get feltup 3 was so crowded was cos performers like pharcyde are
too rare at our parties.  that's all i'm tryen assayee.

so someone believes us (ha, sucker!) and when we go to pay someone pushes us
thru the line and somehow we end up on the other side.. so we keep walking. so
hahafuckingha we got in and didnt have to pay. woohoo. that sold out shit
doesnt phase us. so we get inside, and the place is packed beyond belief. i
havent been to a party that crowded in i dunno how long. probably never. it
was awful trying to move around.. dont even think about finding anyone you
know.. unless youre somehow miraculously squished against them for 10 minutes
while trying to venture up the stairs to the inferno above.. i liked the room
upstairs that spun jungle though (where the actual phantasy is.. with the
boats and crap) cuz it had nice lighting and good ventillation (damnit i cant
spell this morning) and awesome music and my friends were up there and ive
*always* wanted to be happy and dance in that room with all the boats.. theres
a little compartment towards the back hallway where theres a little cubby in
one of the boats.. they wouldnt let anyone go in it, so i didnt get to fulfill
my other goal.. heh.. just kiddin.. but anyway, this party wasnt the greatest,
but i didnt expect it to be after hearing how crappy it was last year (glad i
had to work that night) but overall i ended up having an ok time.. i got
squished up against phantom 45 for 20 minutes and kept touching his butt,
which is always nice. ;o) i ended up leaving around 4 or something though,
because i finally started getting claustraphobic or however you spell it. the
french fries at "my friends" werent as good as they usually are, but the
interesting people in there to watch yell across the whole place made up for
it in entertainment value. <yawn> im going back to bed.  *erin*

I smelled your sweet breath and wiped your tears as you held out your 
hand. This ecstasy could never end. My wall fell completely when I first 
met you -- my painful mistake.

If anyone's curious, there's an article on the front page of the region
section in today's pg about Radio Carson being shutdown(phew).  It
doesn't really have any new info or anything, but it's a decent article,
and is somewhat sympathetic...man that sucks.

today at the bookstore i saw a girl wearing pants that looked to be your
everyday wideleg jeans.  but on further inspection i realized that they were
made of fleece, like the sweatshirt material.  and the heavy cotton stuff too,
not that wimpy 50/50 cotton/poly blend.  i'm pretty sure they weren't
homemade.  i totally would have asked where they were from myself, except that
they were being worn by a super cutie girl, and i guess i'm just shy like
that.

does anyone know where i can get these pants?

i was talking to my parents today.  and my dad said, "we have news for
you...i don't know if i should tell you now or when you get home..but that
radio station you always listen to..that 91.7...was disconnected/shutdown,
something about 100 watts.  you guys are lucky though..at least you can
play your stereo...my roomate is ALWAYS studying so i can never turn
anything on.  i resort to headphones and excessive urban walking -- well,
i guess that's better.

I think it would be great if we could throw a house party in pittsburgh
like the
projekt hous parties.. 3 floors.. an intimate atmosphere.. all we would
need is a
nice size house... if fact perhaps projekt hous.. lighting is the small
rooms would be awesome.. plus the cold weather would keep the heat in
the rooms down ..

Well it does not have to be held at projekt hous... we could hold it any
where.. Im sure theres a big house somewhere we can rent out for a night...
given some time I could find a place.. do we have everything else we would
need? lights, sound system .. dj's .. how many people would be looking at to
show up?

Hi Everyone,
         I was out and about surfing the web (as usual:-)  And a site that I
go to quite often had an article that I found to be amazing!!!!    The only
reason I thought that it was interesting is because the site is a well
repested, and known world wide.  
 
 In summary...  It tell how the Vatican has admitted to existence of
extraterrestrials !!!!

 Vatican Admits On National Television That Extraterrestrial Contact Is Real
 Richard Boylan, Ph.D.
 
 Monsignor Corrado Balducci, a Vatican theologian insider close to the Pope
has gone on national Italian television (RAI) five times in recent months to
proclaim that extraterrestrial contact is a real phenomenon. The prelate
announced that the Vatican is receiving much information about
extraterrestrials and their contacts with humans from its Nuncios (embassies)
in various countries, such as Mexico, Chile and Venezuela. Monsignor Balducci
said that he is on a Vatican commission looking into extraterrestrial
encounters, and how to cope with the emerging general realization of
extraterrestrial contact. 
 
 Balducci provided the Catholic Church's analysis of extraterrestrials,
emphasizing that extraterrestrial encounters "are NOT demonic, they are NOT
due to psychological impairment, they are NOT a case of entity attachment, but
these encounters deserve to be studied carefully." 
 
 Since Monsignor Balducci is a Vatican expert exorcist, and since the Catholic
Church has historically demonized many new phenomena that were poorly
understood, his proclaiming the Vatican's non-censure of these encounters is
all the more remarkable. 
 
 Balducci revealed to a visiting American clinical professional from the
Academy of Clinical Close Encounter Therapists, that the Vatican is closely
following this phenomenon. Parallel information from MJ-12 scientist Dr.
Michael Wolf suggests that the Vatican is concerned that it will have a major
doctrinal updating situation on its hands when extraterrestrial contact
becomes authoritatively announced by world governments over the next several
years.

I just found this amusing as on Oct 11 I was an honored guest of the church, 
private concert, VIP seating, and so forth.  Why you ask?
My great-great aunt was being canonized.  Big festivities.  Didn't get to meet 
the pope as he's too old/frail(looked really bad when I got close to him), but 
did dine with a selection of cardinals and such.  Sat right next too Helmut 
Kohl, Pres of Germany.
That's my randomness for the day.

I am so tired of negitivity about Get Feaky 3 !!!!!!
I thought that party was awesome. 
Except for a few things like : *DEEP BREATH*

-The over crowding in that small ass venue
-The no guest list policy
-Half the people who bought pre-sale... in a word...
 got "fucked" because of the limited capacity.
-That funky ass smell in one of the upstairs rooms
-They shorted the sound guy, and god knows who else
-NO DONALD GLAUDE (its nice to mention that althogh
 he was on the flyer, he was never actully booked)
-That fucking 4 hour extended set by Wilhelm K 
  (for anyone wondering what the M&M's were for)
-They fucking charged $2 bones for a CUP of tap water
-They kicked some kids out for finding free running 
 water elsewhere
-Some asshole security guys
-The fact that if you were lucky enough to somehow
 get your name on that thing resembling a guest list
 you still could not get in (ask brian)
-I really loved it when they closed the upstairs
 completly, crowding the downstairs even more

other than that it was a phat party!!!!!!!!!
Even tho these things were present to bring me down
I still had a pretty good time, so here are some props
to Get Freaky #

-All the dj's were awesome
-The pharcyde was incredible
-The backdoor was kinda kewl
-Raven is a hottie
-And as a special note: I'm am not that much of 
 a Jungle fan but Danny the Wildchild was nothing
 less than FUCKING AMAZING, he showed off some phat
 as turntable skillz. That man is a beast on 2 1200's!
 It was my first time seeing him live, and I am still 
 in awe. Look for this man at my next party! 
 (which hopfully will be on January 30)

-Peace

Just wondering if anyone has two Electric Playground
flyers. (If so, can I have one? It was my first party,
         quite important to me!)

Or if you are a greedy bastard you can make a copy of it 
for yo soy. <-- (I know that doesn't make sense)

Oh yeah, what is that Teknova party called?
The one with DJ Funk.

And how much is DAWN?

		Sorry,

Does anybody have an extra flyer for Unity?  That was my first party, and I
never got a flyer for it.  I never got one for Electric Playground either,
so after Dave gets one, does anybody have an extra one of those also?  And
while I'm at it, does anybody have an extra main flyer for Booty Luva 2 or
Terminal Velocity?  I just have pre-flyers for those two.  I hope I don't
sound greedy; these are the only flyers I don't have of parties I have been
to...  If you can help me out, please e-mail me and I will give you my
address.  Thanks!

i find it odd that people have all of the flyers for raves theyve been to. i
think i might have 50% or so. or less probably.

Okay ya'll just wanted to give you a heads up on a game coming out.  Its
called Bust-a-move.  We ordered it from magazine imported from Japan.  Its the
best game I've ever played.  Imagine it a game where you battle your friend
with dance moves! 14 dancers ranging from a robot that Vogues to a stripper
that dances sexy-hip-hop style or a old school pop lock'n breaker.  Of course
they have 2 "rave" dancers.
You score points by inputing your button commands to the beat.  Different
types of  music are used from Disco to Hard Techno!!!  You try to build your
dancers Momentum until he or she "Freezes" in a wicked pose appropriate to
their style O' dancing.
They used some bad as technology to make this game the movements are so real!!
My brother and I have started bitting some of the dance moves from the game!


The game will be out here sometime around Christmas!!

I haven't really saved many fliers.  I have a few that I deemed important
in the early years.  I know a certain someone (Tom knows him, too) that
has fliers for not only the parties he's been to, but ones from all over
the country and world that he hasn't been to.  There are hundreds of
fliers from pb, cle, columbus, indiana, nyc, philly, jersey, toronto,
switzerland, germany, etc.  It's really interesting to look through them
and see the different styles used in different places and at different
times.  I think they span about four years.  I also think he should make a
book but that would take A LOT of time and effort on his part with all the
permission getting, etc.

it could be like the book of absolut artwork from the vodka ads.....that

I met some of the girls of  Lovebomb through mutual friends and they are really
great people, so I really hope to make it to this party. I am sure it will be a
good one! Due to depletion of funds and energy from going to three parties in
the last  week :o), I'm probaly going to wait for Brisk to be my next
party....maybe....
plur,

My vote on Erie as the party location, too! I'm sure the people of Fusion
Records would be more than happy to help out...they're great people.
I went there on Friday for Club Insomnia, had a good time but left my camera
there! Thankfully, it was not stolen and I was able to pick it up there the
next day :o) I thought I might never get to see my Magick pictures...now they
have to return safely from the photo lab...
plur,
Brooke

I think they actually have something like that . . . I'm not sure tho.

I prob. have somewhere between 200-500 flyers posted all over my
walls.  I have very little empty space left.  As far as I'm concerned:
who needs wall paper if you have flyers?  What would you rather look at:
1) one beat ass color (white, tan etc)
2) one continuous pattern (wallpaper)
or 
3) a shitload of pimped out designs with computer graphics and all
sorts of other trippy shit . . .

the answer is obvious :)

No way! Erie is a pretty damn long drive from Columbus. Pittsburgh, 
Cleveland, or even Youngstown are cool, though.

      a note on radio snack: while usually slightly
      overpriced, their quality of electronics and
      part durability has increased _dramatically_
      over the past years. not only have they started
      moving into audiophile territory with large gauge
      gold-plated connectors and parts, and the linauem
      tweeter (which you can order from them separately
      for like $25 and is one of the best tweeters for
      basic use) but they will replace almost EVERYTHING.
      i have bought stuff there with a credit card
      (note - always use plastic for yo pro'tektion) and
      brought it back within a few weeks (in good 
      condition) and gotten a full +tax refund. then
      about a week ago i bounced my dual-band qualcomm
      off the pavement and they replaced it without
      any questions or charges. not only that, i got a
      newer model with newer features and better 
      durability. i don't think i got the extended
      warranty either - and i'd had the phone more than

we should plot our locations on a map, find the center, and everyone will
shut the fuck up.  most of us live in a developed setting, leaving
undeveloped land in the center.  our biome is classified as deciduous
forest. the probability that this rave will be held in a forest is high. 
confidence is high.  i repeat, confidence is high.  oh no, i just realized
that i will throw the centerpoint off and it will be held in the allegheny
mountains or upstate newyork(yucx).  this is assuming that we can all get
there linearly (airplane, rocket, missile).

the computer graphics detract from the non-shittiness of the party.  they
are there to distract you and attract the unintelligent.  giving a sense
that this party is going to be some mystical journey.  patterns usually
provoke thought.  one color promotes a feeling.  i don't even know what
you are talking about [re: absolut], but the absolut ads are a proven
supression device used to inhibit creativity and give a sum feeling that
drinking this is OK.  stay away...you go nowhere.=20

oh, i was right.  current rave-flyers are indeed uncreative and
homogenized.  this is so they attract the same group of people each time.
people that are attracted to tekno-babbling.  i do give support (i know
you want it) to those that have flyers that are innovative.  i save
rave-flyers too.  they look great against a
urine-pseudofluoroescent-yellow base.  it is cool to mix them with things
that you find interesting from back-issues of national geographic
magazine.  i save the armbands too, because they house most of the
electrolytes that were emitted from my body at the party.  and i save
other stained items.  i saved my water bottle from biz and it is hanging
from my ceiling at home.  it still had some whater in it too...amazing.
it is hanging by a hunter-green bootstring.  when i get excited i smack it
and that pendulum theory goes to action er sum shit.

WILHELM K BLOWS ASS ALL OVER THE FLOOR.  I HAVE ONE OF HIS CDS.  YES, I AM
MAKING A GENERALIZATION BASED ON THAT ONE CD ENTITLED, "GET DOWN TO THE
HOUSE GROOVE VOL. 3".  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THAT!

actually, that house party was cool.  but i was the only one dancing.
they had jungle in the basement and (whoever wanted to spin) upstairs.  at
like 12, people began to dance.  then the other owners of the house came
home and they were all white people with bottles of beer in their hands
wearing cable-knit sweaters.  they all stared at the filthy ravers and
some immediately mocked the dancing.  then, they found a room and ....
then a policeman walked through the front door and got a glass of water
from the kitchen (he lived there..ha ha).  i did notice, that it wasn't
vibe-enhanced.  i mean people authentically enjoyed their time there, but
it looked as though they all read the rave-manual before they attended.  i
did dance to jungle once because it was a progression from jungle to happy
hardcore using a cyndi lauper song (awwl, how cute).  but then they blew.
and some guy played a song from my wilhelm K comp.  (that's why i
remembered this)..which prompted me to stop dancing.  then, this three
suburbanites porting house-of-pain-esque style gear walked in, very
intimidating.  the free-spin was over.  they all sat down together.  it
tunrs out they were waiting for a local boston hardcore DJ "Bingus Khan".
when he approached the kitchen counter, i mean decks..they all shouted
hardcore, but when he spunt they didnt even dance!>?>!  it was OK,
hardcore, KALI is better.  =======

I'm looking for a dj who spins trance, house or techno (preferably all 3)
for a mixer I'm throwing next Tuesday evening.  Your pay is as much food
as you can consume.  You must have your own gear and records.  In other
words, I'm looking for a dj who wants a little exposure and practice
before a live audience. The crowd will be diverse.  It's from 4-7ish on
Tuesday, November 17th.  I don't care if your skills aren't perfect.
There's a 3 trainwreck limit though :)  

Email in private.

Well after get freaky 3 was so-so, im thinkin of checking out a dope ass
party. navigate will be the shit..... but the only problem is i need a ride
down to columbus. if anyone from cleveland is heading down there and  can give
me a ride it would be much appreciated.... thanx 
but now id like to tell peeps the problems with get freaky 3.
besides all the known ones of the crowded factor and the horrible vibe there
was worse shit going down.
1)  THERE WERE FUCKIN GUNS THERE!! 	if theres one thing i cant deal with is
that. peeps who think theyre the hardest muthafuckas because they carry guns
into a rave. fuck that
2) KIDS PUSHING DRUGS.	look i know people live by the idea of trying
everything at least once but please dont push drugs on kids.  i saw all these
peeps asking kids if theyve done drug "X" if they hadnt ever done that drug
they were like if i give this to you will u take it. i saw these kids pushing
x, coke, meth and all other shit.. that  aint cool at all.
 well enough venting
peace, 
plur

Well I have noticed that I am a little late on my review. Well to be
honest I didnt have that great of a time.  There were just way too many
people there. Waiting 45 mins just to get upstairs was insane. Then to
find out it would be another 45mins before you got out of the hallway
and into a room.  I had to make a decision to stay in one room. I picked
the main room downstairs. I found this to be a good decision until the
Pharcyde came on. Now dont get mee wrong they were AWESOME!!!! But
having what seemed like 500,000 people pushing on me to get closer to
the stage when I was in the front was ridiculous. I did have fun. There
was no way that a net meet could have occured. There was just no place
to have it. If it did happen I am sorry that I missed you all. However i
would like to say HI to Ray who I met as I was trying to find the driver
in that monsterous sea of people so we could leave. I am just sad that
my last party for a while left me so diappointed. Oh well I'll listen
next time when people try to warn me. Live and learn.

  Di

ty
of places to locate it....

I just think it should be in a location where the least amount of 
people have to do the least amount of driving, and nobody has to
drive forever to get there. Didn't Kelly say that she had a space
in Pittsburgh anyway?

Just to let everyone know who is still discussing this on
the general list: Jamie has set up a separate list so that
we can discuss this without clogging up normal list mail. 

I believe that the address for this list is 
trout-party@hyperreal.org

Email Jamie if you want to be on it so that we can begin
discussing on a formal list.

decorate and run the door. Thanks again to rhombus, datajack and
abstract for performing. the audio can be found at

Subject: {pb-cle} PARTY suggestions
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Just a few thoughts.  We've been discussing this party for a long time, and
while it has been very productive, I think we need to figure some specifics
out soon.  Since the party is for all list members, there are some things
we need to decide as a whole, the more general things, and then once those
are decided we can have a smaller committee, or whatever you want to call
it, work on the details.  I propose we set a deadline to determine some of
the essential things, so that we can work from there.  I don't want to cut
short the discussion, but we can discuss for months without getting
anywhere.  What if we have some sort of ballot, with the general but
necessary questions on it, give everyone a chance to discuss/respond, and
then on a certain date (fairly soon) we'll tally the votes and then the
smaller committee can start going to work.  Here's a sample ballot:


1.  Which city would you like the pb-cle party to be in?
2.  How should we determine cost of admission to the party?
    a. Charge a set rate at the door, based on expenses
    b. Pre-sale tickets only
    c. Charge a price at the door, but have cheaper presale tickets available
    d. Have a free party and fund the party with donations only
3.  Are you willing to donate any money to fund the party, and if so how much?
4.  What should we do with any excess profit?
5.  How should we account for any money lost?
6.  Should we have one room of sound, or two?
7.  Should we open the party up to non-list members?
     If yes:
          a. guestlist only
          b. open to anyone, with R.O.A.R. in effect
8.  Should we have any non-list musicians perform?  If so, who?
9.  When is the best date for you to have this party?


These are some essential questions that I believe should represent
everyone's opinion on the list.  There are probably some things I have left
out, but I think we should set a deadline for people to vote on these and
then count up the votes.  Then we can set up a smaller committee to work on
the details, such as venue, sound, lighting, etc.  This is just a
suggestion, so let me know what you think.  I hate formal stuff like this,
but it seems the only easy way to reach a consensus with 220-some people on
the list. I am more than willing to collect ballots if that is what we
decide to do.  Just let me know.  I just figured we needed to get things
rolling, no pun intended.  plur, dan

Your server keeps returning e-mail Im trying to send you. I might have the
wrong e-mail address, so if you could e-mail me so that I can get your
correct address that would be great.

Thanks

> 4.  What should we do with any excess profit?

i thought about this, and theres really no fair way to deal with it.  but
i came up with an  idea.  if the party does actually turn a profit, why
dont we register our own domain for the list? i know its a cheezy idea ;>

By the way "Take the A Train" is a Glenn Miller instrumental from the 1940's i
don't know if any of you guys would want to mix it with a RAVE beat..you might
just start a new style of music

<< hi Guys and gals and everybody in between, i have wanted to throw a house
 party ever since i moved in about a year ago, so i saw that there was kind of
 an open date on SAT NOVEMBER 21, 1998.  I usually name my parties, this one
 will be called "Take the A Train-a collection of my favorite hits".  i can
 only have about 30 or so kids over and it would be nice if we could set up
 some tables for yunz guyz who want to spin.  as usual i will hand out bags
 loaded with toys, light sticks, and lots of candy and other stuff to make the
 party enjoyable.  i will be printing up some flyers soon, please "E"-mail me
 directly at MrRab@AOL.com if you are interested or would like to spin.  this
 will be kind of a pre-party to quondam beats. the party will be in the
 pitsburgh area hope to hear from you soon. p.L.u.R. {;-[)+< mark

we could do this, but then we need a server to attatch it to. that incurrs more monthly costs. but, i might consider donating my virtual server to the list once i get my dedicated box up. i'll keep yas posted. ;)

Well first off i wasn't expecting to much out of GF3 .
Knowing The promoter's reputation. But i did look
forward to seeing Pharcyde. Which never happened. That
is because i lounged around my house all night and
didn't leave till a little after midnight. I live super
close to the venue so i figured that would give me
plenty of time to get in and see Pharcyde. Wrong!! I
went straight to the back of the line (since i hate
cutting). The line was quite long and i stood in one
place for 15-20 mins. Then the line finally started to
move. Istarted to get close and they started gathering
all the people w/ pre-sale tix and proceeded to let
them in. I was stopped short by 5 people of getting in
:(  I don't blame the promoters or cutters. I should
have bought a pre-sale rite up the street or left
earlier. I went home somewhat pissed and emailed the
list. Then went back up a little before 4 and they let
me in for twenty bucks. Once i was in I saw a lot of
people that were also turned away. It was packed but im
sure not as packed as earlier. I got to the ,main room
just in time to see who i came for T-1000. It may have
been me but, he just didnt sound loud enuff. I thought
the vibe was pretty cool and had a good time except i
could do w/o the Wilhelm k extended set. He really
ruined the end of the party for me. We were forced to
listen to him.gag!  I met a few out of towners. I met
some really cool people from Niagra Falls. They said
they had a great time and will have to come back again.
All the new people i met made this a worth while party
for me. Does anyone know if they were charging for
water refills? I didnt get charged the only time i went
up.
plur
Ray

so many ppl from the list lived in Pitt, though, so i guess that may be
difficult. esp if the getting a venue there is a *SNAP*.  at any rate, i
feel for the kids in toledo/columbus/cinci that would wanna come...

well, i'm biased, so i say pittsburgh. plus, if we wanna broadcast it like
real geeks, ;), pittsburgh is better cuz it doesn't cost as much. plus, (a
little insider info) the venue kelly has in mind has a phoneline. just my
$.02 from my perspective. :)

>i'd like to say somethin like 5$ pre-sale, 10$ at the door--no exceptions
(of course there always are).  if only 100 ppl bought presale, is 500$ a
?good start? or a ?drop in the bucket?
> d. Have a free party and fund the party with donations only 
>that would be an awful lot of donations (but then again, what kind of
resources do we have now w/ regard to sound systems and venues?)

on this idea, i say that everybody that sends in a donation gets
guestlisted +1. a donation of say $10, from (i hope i'm being realistic
here) say 100 listees, yields $1000 and 200 guestlist spots. that gives us
a good start on a bank to work with, plus a realtively good turnout to
start off with. then charge $5/head at the door for everybody else. if
there's $$$ left over, roll it into a fund to get t-shirts for everybody
that donated. That way, if ya pitched in and helped out, ya get a cool
pb-cle shirt to show your support. ;) 

>3.  Are you willing to donate any money to fund the party,      and if so
how much? 
>give till it hurts baby.

i'm definatly willing to donate.  i'll give whatever i can, and things look
pretty good. :)

>4.  What should we do with any profit? 
>put it in a savings account until the next one...  *GRIN*

see question 2. :)

>5.  How should we account for any money lost? 
>voodoo magic.  i have no idea.  see question 3.

again, see question 2.

>6.  Should we have one room of sound, or two? 
>two.  definitely if we can afford the sound setup.  if for no other
reason, so ppl can have a choice.  this would mean settin a lineup that
played good opposites.

this depends on the venue. but if possible, yes. i think we can prolly pull
together enough sound to get 2 rooms together.

>7.  Should we open the party up to non-list members? 
>yes. guestlist only.  does this tread towards elitist selection, though? i
know i'd feel better if i knew everyone there knew or was known by someone
on the list.

qusetion 2 again. 

>8.  Should we have any non-list musicians perform?  If so,      who? 
>few if any. who? yikes.

i think we should maybe go for the option that someone suggested about
getting former listees that "made it". like dieselboy and 1.8.7.  since
1.8.7 was the original list admin, i would hope that she would do it for
free. one would hope that dieselboy would do it for free too, but who
know's if that will happen. i think it's something one of us should follow
up on tho. If they do decide to do it, they could draw a crowd, and more
$$$ for those who threw in. nicer shirts, or even better! pb-cle.T.S
hoodies! ;)

>9.  When is the best date for you to have this party? 
>february/march (personally, the warmer the better).  what's the weather
like in Pitt in Jan? if you don't hafta beat old man winter too bad, maybe
the end of Jan.

i think we should look at our options. we should keep in mind that some
listees are in school. but, we should get together in one room to talk
about this one. or atleast get together on IRC to discuss it.

:)

By the way "Take the A Train" is a Glenn Miller instrumental from the 1940's i
don't know if any of you guys would want to mix it with a RAVE beat..you might
just start a new style of music

<< hi Guys and gals and everybody in between, i have wanted to throw a house
 party ever since i moved in about a year ago, so i saw that there was kind of
 an open date on SAT NOVEMBER 21, 1998.  I usually name my parties, this one
 will be called "Take the A Train-a collection of my favorite hits".  i can
 only have about 30 or so kids over and it would be nice if we could set up
 some tables for yunz guyz who want to spin.  as usual i will hand out bags
 loaded with toys, light sticks, and lots of candy and other stuff to make the
 party enjoyable.  i will be printing up some flyers soon, please "E"-mail me
 directly at MrRab@AOL.com if you are interested or would like to spin.  this
 will be kind of a pre-party to quondam beats. the party will be in the
 pitsburgh area hope to hear from you soon. p.L.u.R. {;-[)+< mark

> >1.  Which city would you like the pb-cle party to be in? 

Ok, I don't just want pb for private reasons.  The fact that Kelly already
has a space makes pb all the more attractive, not to mention the
availability of a phone line as Andy T. pointed out.  

> >2.  How should we determine cost of admission to the party? 
	a. Charge a set rate at the door, based on expenses
	b. Pre-sale tickets only 
      X	c. Charge a price at the door, but have cheaper presale
	d. Have a free party and fund the party with donations only

It seems like it's been so long since there've been cheap admissions and
cheapers pre-sale.  Let's go retro...anyway, again, I like Andy T's idea
of small donations of people on the list, to be included on a guest list
later.

> >3.  Are you willing to donate any money to fund the party, and if so
> how much? 

I'm willing to donate, but I wonder how we will transfer the money and to
whom.

> >4.  What should we do with any profit? 

Andy T's my man.  I liked a lot of his ideas, including the one about the
t-shirts or hoodies.  We've been wanting to do t-shirts (ahem).  Although,
a donation made to a charity wouldn't be a bad idea either.  Of course, we
all know what a huge debate would go on over which one!  Just to cast my
vote now, I think it would really bewilder the public (if they ever found
out) if we donated to some sort of drug/alcohol prevention/rehabilitation
group.   How poetic.

> >5.  How should we account for any money lost? 

If we do it as cheaply as possible and only use money we know we have, how
could we lose?  I'm not being cheeky.  If there's an answer, by all means,
tell me.

> >6.  Should we have one room of sound, or two? 

Two's always nice and we definitely have enough dj's to fill 'em but
perhaps we should wait and see what the space can accomodate.

> >7.  Should we open the party up to non-list members? 

We're always talking about how we wish the scene wasn't so shady,
questionable, etc.  Then we talk about using pb-cle to better the scene.
Why not use pb-cle in order to better the scene by throwing a kick-ass,
good-vibe party?  Of course non-list members should be included, how else
do we get the word out about pb-cle?  Besides, at our BEST net-meet, we
had around 30 or 40 people, right?  That's not a rave, that's a house
party and I've been to bigger house parties.

> >8.  Should we have any non-list musicians perform?  If so,      who? 
> >few if any. who? yikes.

I think it should be all list members.  We have enough, by far!  As far as
1.8.7. goes, isn't she still a list member?  My vote is for her!!!!!

> >9.  When is the best date for you to have this party?  >february/march

Well, if you schedule on my recital, none of you will be able to come, and
that would be a tragedy!  My vote is for January, february!

lets do 2:30 cuz 2:00 always conflicts with DJ switching and Don cant

If/when I actually get my ass in gear and get this machine up that I
am trying to get up for a friend then ill gladly donate some space on
it towards the scene for some pages. Actually I am thinking I might
try to put up my own machine somewhere (I have an extra p133 lying
around doing dick) so if anyone can find me a real cheap place to put
a machine online I WILL donate it to scene usage kindof like hyperreal
but I would rather it be for the pb-cle scene primarily.

ps-someone should tally these votes.


Here are the tallies as of 7:50 p.m. on Wed, Nov. 11
(I only counted responses sent since 11/9, after I sent the ballot)

1. Location:
   Pittsburgh: 3 votes
   Kent:3 votes
   East Liverpool, OH: 1 vote

2.charging of admission:
  a. set rate at door: 1 vote
  b. pre-sale only: 0 votes
  c. door/cheaper pre-sale: 2 votes
  d. free, relying on donations: 3 votes

3. willingness to donate:
   most everyone who has responded seems willing to help out as much as
they can

4.suggestions for excess profit:
  --breakfast for members/$ to Hyperreal/$ for Don (Wiz. Wkshop)
  --savings for next party
  --t-shirts for everyone who donated
  --t-shirt idea/charity (poss. drug & alcohol abuse prevention)

5.suggestions if we lose money:
  everyone who responded seems confident that this won't be a problem

6.one room or multi-rooms of sound:
  everyone seems to want multi-rooms if venue accommodates it

7.open to non-list members?
  guestlist only: 2 votes
  open to all: 5 votes
  the consensus seems to be that this should be open to all but not heavily

  promoted

8.non-list musicians?  if so, who?
  no: 5 votes
  few if any: 1 vote
  yes: 1 vote   1.8.7./ dieselboy

9.date?
  --after Jan (2nd Sat in Feb.)
  --Feb/March (maybe end of Jan)--warmer weather
  --Jan/Feb
  --discuss more

Well, these are the tallies so far.  I am willing to continue to keep track
of the votes if you want me to.  This obviously doesn't represent all of
the 220-some people on the list, so keep on sending them.  Does anyone have
any suggestions on when or if we should set a date to "close the ballots?"
Maybe we should set a date to get together in person to start planning the
party first and set the deadline before then?   most likely, though, the
votes will start becoming obvious as more people send ballots...  I don't
know, I'll just keep counting them until someone tells me to stop...
plur, dan

I'm confused as to the purpose of the trout-party address.  Is this the
only address we should use for discussion of the party, or is that just for
certain types of discussion?  I don't want to leave anybody out, but is it
correct to assume that everyone who is interested in helping with/
discussing the party is or should be registered to that address, and
everybody who is not registered doesn't want to be bothered with mail about
the party?  Could someone please make this clear?  Also if anyone needs a
copy of the ballot, let me know and I can send you another one.

Just because an artist temporarily changes his place of residence, it does
not make his/her record label move along with them. Please try calling
Duncan (i.e. Trace) in Philly next week, and let me know if he's there.
Good luck getting a hold of him.

Your argument would have been stronger if you mentioned Neil Landstrumm as
well (who temporarily resides in NYC). But his labels are still based out
of the UK, as are most of his post-productions (same applies for Trace).

Ciao,
Viktor

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

 become one of the most respected musicians in the scene.
 Lorne tips it up every time, from the UK to Toronto to

 she will be a unique addition to any jungle set.  "Keep
 it movin'-Come on".

 the Canadian side of jungle to their first Columbus event.

Sat Nov 28                        ENERGIZE                               DC

U L T R A W O R L D 
in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year history.
It is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for it to do to
the dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond.  It will be held in
the massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in this space
before, none will compare to the excellence of Energize.

The main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one
wide-open, high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set
Energize apart from our previous events is that we have now been approved
to use the basement! Don't think basement like dark and dingy though,
this basement has ceilings of 40', and makes the biggest dance clubs on
the East Coast look like efficiency apartments in Manhattan.  Plus it's
divided up into rooms of various sizes. 
For the first time at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all
with full on concert level production in both sound and lighting.  

All performers listed below are confirmed.  The four rooms of Energize
will
be:

The Main Arena:   We will fill this space with the best sound system we
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of lasers,
projection screens and intelligent lights.  The lineup is one of the best
we have ever presented, a true blend of the most prevalent styles of
electronic dance music.  From hard techno, to trance, to funky breaks, to
fun party music, the main room at Energize is going to be all that and
more.  The performers are:

CARL CRAIG performing live as
Paperclip People  Planet E Records, Detroit
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI  Matsuri Productions  London/Tokyo
DOC MARTIN  Los Angeles
ICEY  Zone, Orlando
SCOTT HENRY  Buzz, DC
T1000  Generator/DJax, Detroit
NIGEL RICHARDS  611 Records, Philadelphia

You may have seen that Uberzone was previously listed in the main room.
They
had said they were available, but then decided to cancel all bookings for
the
rest of the year to make time to write new music. 

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena:  In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the
undisputed
champions of the U.K. scene.  This area will be hosted by 2 Tuff
productions
of DC.  The lineup is:

GROOVERIDER  Sony, Prototype, U.K.
FABIO  U.K.
MC GQ  the U.K.'s premier MC
DARA  Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY  Platinum, Philadelphia
AK1200  Orlando
DB  Breakbeat Science, NYC
SLANT  2 Tuff, DC
ENTITY  Ultraworld
FLUID  Sonic Soul, Baltimore
MC DUB2  Philadelphia

The Deep House Arena:  This third area, also in the basement, is bigger
then any dance club on the East Coast.  It will be hosted by
Philadelphia's Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long.  The performers are:

DERRICK CARTER  Chicago
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION  Universal Language, U.K.
FEELGOOD  Charm City Records, Baltimore
KENNY GLASGOW  Toronto
O'KEEFE  Circle, Philly
ROB PAINE  Circle, Philly
SEAN THOMAS  Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena:  The smallest area of the event, but still bigger
then the main room at most clubs!  This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
respected Sonic Soul crew, and will feature the downtempo side of
electronic music.  You can dance if you want to, with performers:

TIM "LOVE" LEE  Tummy Touch, U.K.
PETE LAWRENCE  the Big Chill, U.K.
WE performing live  Asphodel, NYC
LOVEGROVE  Sonic Soul
DJ C  Toneburst, Boston
RHOMBUS  Sonic Soul

What makes this event even more exciting, is the fact that it will be a
collaborative effort between Ultraworld, Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.
While Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction for
the event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically manage
the areas of music they are most interested in.  What that means for you
is that you get the highest quality of production and care going into
every aspect of the event.

Tickets will be on sale in the DC/Baltimore area on September 30, and
should be at all of the outlets by October 3, and will be broken down as
follows:

There will be 1000 tickets sold for only $20!   So if you know you're
going to go, you have the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low
price.  We are accepting orders for these tickets now, or you can wait
until they are at the outlets. If you'd like to mail order your ticket,
send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER ONLY, made out to Ultraworld Productions for $20
per ticket ordered.  Send it to:

Ultraworld Productions
3042 O'Donnell St
Baltimore, MD  21224

After those 1000 are gone the price will be $25 up to and including
October 31.  

On November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that
price even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets.  Admission at the
gate will be $35.

Also, we are working with the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend.
For those of you who may not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held
every Friday by DJ's Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt.  It plays host to
the world's top DJ's and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of
the best in the country.  When you purchase your ticket to Energize, there
will be a stub which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for
only $5  (Note: Tickets purchased through Ticketmaster will not have this
stub, but Buzz will honor the $5 admission).   Consider coming to DC on
Friday, and making a long stay of it.  We'll post hotel and travel info on
this site in the weeks to come. 

To stay in DC, try these hotels:
Phoenix Park Hotel (closest to venue)	202.638.6900
Best Western (closest to Buzz & afterparty)	202.488.7500
Holiday Inn				202.383.3838
Wyndham Bristol				202.995.6400

Rates are around $90 per night.


When you've had your turkey and you're done with the family, 
the place to be is Washington, D.C. for Ultraworld's ENERGIZE!!!

Okay, the Tricky show last nite in Pittsburgh was like UNBELIEVABLE!  It 
was the most intense show I've seen in quite some time.

Whale opened and they were great as well.  

So I think he stops in CLE next (or was he already there?)  I don't 
know...anyway, if you were thinking of going and aren't totally 
sure...you are now--->Go see it!

smooth.

now i must rely on substandard pbcle !=:]!

the guy running it claimed that there were:  too many crossposts,
low-integrity aol + hotmail accounts (low integrity meaning: the owner
abandons the account), too much publicity for the list -- millions of
newbies pouring in as a result of search for "rave list" on altavista.
essentially, he said the list was no longer
"underground/critical/specialized".  the server is being moved from
northeastern to somewhere "else" and a new sub address will be secretly
distributed to those "that know".  the br raves server had one of those
wild short lives (1993-1998).  mr.g if get the address i'll forward it to
you.

let us observe this horrible rave-mailing-list gone wrong and never let it
happen to us.

sensationalism:  he said there were 1200msgs/day that were not appropriate

maybe i missed something, but i just saw this message with these
questions + answers + thought i'd answer them too.

> 1.  Which city would you like the pb-cle party to be > in? 

personally, i don't care since i'll drive to wherever + pick up
anybody on the way, but for the list as a whole, a centralized
location is probably best, provided there is a decent venue + no
opposition from the police.

> 3.  Are you willing to donate any money to fund the > party,     
and if so how much? 

well i don't have much money, so if you have a specific
date + amount, i can answer this.

> 6.  Should we have one room of sound, or two? 

two is ideal, so you can always change rooms if you don't like the
music in one. i hope we can have a chill room with couches. i miss
being able to rest someplace dry, comfortable, + relatively clean--and
rest my ears--once in a while. i could probably find an old couch
someplace (kent ;) couch city) + bring it. if all the performers + DJs
are volunteering (are they?), then having 2 rooms won't cost that much
more than 1. 

> 8.  Should we have any non-list musicians perform?  
> If so,      who? 

well try to book all the listmembers that you can, then if you need
more people, book some non-listmembers. word to ya mother on 187. i'll
spin for free (hard room or chill room), + bring my tables + mixer if
you need them.

I read somewhere that it is good to take it during the cold season for
reasons discussed, but bad to take year round because it has the potential
to mess up your system.

By the way "Take the A Train" is a Glenn Miller instrumental from the 1940's i
don't know if any of you guys would want to mix it with a RAVE beat..you might
just start a new style of music

<< hi Guys and gals and everybody in between, i have wanted to throw a house
 party ever since i moved in about a year ago, so i saw that there was kind of
 an open date on SAT NOVEMBER 21, 1998.  I usually name my parties, this one
 will be called "Take the A Train-a collection of my favorite hits".  i can
 only have about 30 or so kids over and it would be nice if we could set up
 some tables for yunz guyz who want to spin.  as usual i will hand out bags
 loaded with toys, light sticks, and lots of candy and other stuff to make the
 party enjoyable.  i will be printing up some flyers soon, please "E"-mail me
 directly at MrRab@AOL.com if you are interested or would like to spin.
 the party will be in the
 pitsburgh area hope to hear from you soon. p.L.u.R. {;-[)+< mark

Like the other heads said: Tricky was the fucking bomb.  Completely
intense, never letting up, crazy pshycolgical, fuck with your head and
make you go crazy type shit.

Tricky would start shaking his head back and forth reaaaaaly fast just
kind of trying to get rid of reality . . . and I completely
understood.  His stage presence is incredible!  Same w/ martina.  That
girl is hypnotizing, not to mention compeletely gorgous.  background
musicians tore it up (except for the drummer consistantly missing one
drum hit :).  Lighting was neat.

Oh and BTW: Tricky didn't just smoke one blunt.  I was up front for
most of the show and I would say every two or three songs he would
light up a six inch stogie that was on top of this thing w/ his water
bottle and just puff with his back to the audience.  Dude has GOT to
have a tolerance!

peace,

absolut

ps-for all of you who saw the show and didn't like it cause: you have
NO idea what tricky is all about.

 if that was the most intense show youve seen in a while you need to go out
more. while it was definitely a good show, i feel it was more laid back and
chilled, as opposed to intense. none of the musicians (other than tricky,
who i think was having back spasms all night, or something:) moved around
much...oh yeah, i forgot about the gyrating motion of that bomb girl's
hips......THAT was intense.

I have a feeling we could be here for eternity with all the ballots and
suggestions.  It seems as though we should start with one thing and then
move onto others.  First, the city&venue.  From what I remember, we have 3
choices on the table (correct me if I'm missing any.  I know you will :))

1. Erie/new store/club (is this still a definite?) # rooms?
2. Sphere/Viscious Circle/Youngstown (is this a definite?) # rooms?
3. Crackron/Steve space-# rooms?
4. Pittsburgh/Kelly space-1 room

Obviously I'm biased (sort of).  I want this party to happen no matter
where it happens.  I do realize however that it would be in the party's
best interest to have an organizer in the area where it's going to take
place.  Although not a huge venture (comparatively), it would definitely
be more challenging to set up, tear down, and organize in general if doing
so from another city.  If someone in Erie or Akron is able to take on this
responsibility, go for it.  I'll assist from here if need be.  I will also
point out that the sound is here in Pittsburgh (Wizard Workshop-will do
for cost if many hands are available to make his work light) and I believe
that most of the DJs are from here as well (doesn't mean anything really
except that obviously Pgh. is well represented on the list).  It's
impossible for all of us to come to agreement on any of the decisions to
be made.  I say let's give ourselves the deadline of Monday (someone
mentioned waiting until after LOLife to see how it turns out) to get votes
on location.  There's really no use in adding any other choices to the
list.  After all, it's not the city that will make the party happen, it's
having a space in the city.  So, assuming that we have 3 solid spaces with
3 solid organizers attached to those spaces, let's vote on that first.
>From there whoever is responsible for the space should take the
responsibility of collecting the money.  People have already started
sending it my way, so.  I'll keep track and hand it over if necessary.
Next?

This morning, Hank Hughes announced the death of Boston raves.  We strongly
feel that the list has a right to live... and more importantly a NEED to
live.. despite any AOL/hotmail problems... and despite message-volume
problems.  I now live in Boston, and am growing to love the Boston
scene... 

Won't you join us on the NEW Boston-raves list?

OK, here goes for all those in wonder and wait.....
venue turns out to be still usable..... to an extent.
heres the but if.......
The owner has still not filled in the trenches for water lines to the building

and heavy equipment is still all around.
So instead of waiting for an insurance claim to happen we are moving
to backup plan B and not holding this event at the Kent venue.

So ixnae the Kent idea unless the owners finish w/ all the construction.
(don't fret.... deposit returned, and owner still says he would let us use in
future.)

Oh yeah,
Love.of Life to be held in downtown CrAkron .... at the Wet .
(formerly the daily-double) and w/ the second room to open up @ 4am
in the space adjoining.(Panini's).

directions:
from points north - take I-77 south to I-76 west
from points south - take I-77 north to I-76 west
from points east - take I-76 west, to the Main St./Downtown exit.
veer to the right onto Broadway  then follow the general directions.
from points west - .take I - 76 east to the Main St./Downtown exit
going staight to the second light  and take a left onto Broadway Ave.
*general directions -
          Take Broadway to Exchange St., turn left onto Exchange St.
          Go 2 blocks (just past Main St.) and the venue is on the left.
           (Corner of Exchange St. and Otleans)
Do not park down Orleans St. as it is a dead end road and only a block long.

L8az all !! =^)

Hello. I am new to the list, and I've been reading all the posts for 
about a week now, and I was thinking a little bit about this party.

It seems to me that most of the parties in this area (pb-clev_ are held 
in pgh and clev. Now, instead of trying to pick a place in one of those 
cities to have a party, why not have it in Columbus. not only is that 
almost the same distance from each place, but it gives the columbus and 
cinci kids a break

Also, it seems you were all talking about getting a good vibe out there 
with this party, so, why not open it to list members, and 1 or 2 gusts. 
That way, you'll have primarily your list members, but also have the 
chance to introduce some new people to the happiness that is 
pb-cle-raves!

And I think before you decide how much it should be, you should figure 
out how many definite people are gonna come. Then you can decide on 1) a 
date that will work for (almost) everyone, and 2) whether you should 
rely on donations, or a small "ticket" price

And I definitely love the idea of donating any left over cash to a 
charity...kudos to whomever suggested that.

Those were my thoughts, open to criticism!
 :)
Plur, 
Patti

    ... an online article from the San Francisco Bay Chronicle reports
on a Florida professor's success in getting oranges to express THC, the
active ingredient of marijuana.  Gives a whole new meaning to the
screwdriver cocktail, and to the smile on Anita Bryant's face.  In
twenty
years what follows will be a high school experiment and pretty much make
a
farce of the mostly ineffective (and irrational in light of alcohol)
anti-marijuana policies.  My favorite will be to see someone alter the
genetic makeup of the cocoa bean.  There is a THC-like compound in
chocolate
(one chocolate candy bar is about 1/400 as active as a marijuana joint)
-
just insert some genes to get this compound's gene to multiply express -

voila - and no matter how much chocolcate you eat you still are hungry
:-)

....

                                       ====

            A Florida Biochemist designs a citrus tree with THC.


    In the summer of 1984, 10th-grader Irwin Nanofsky and a friend were
driving down the Apalachee Parkway on the way home from baseball
practice
when they were pulled over by a police officer for a minor traffic
infraction.

    After Nanofsky produced his driver's license the police officer
asked
permission to search the vehicle. In less than two minutes, the officer
found a homemade pipe underneath the passenger's seat of the Ford
Aerostar
belonging to the teenage driver's parents. The minivan was seized, and
the
two youths were taken into custody on suspicion of drug possession.

    Illegal possession of drug paraphernalia ranks second only to open
container violations on the crime blotter of this Florida college town.
And
yet the routine arrest of 16 year-old Nanofsky and the seizure of his
family's minivan would inspire one of the most controversial
drug-related
scientific discoveries of the century.

    Meet Hugo Nanofsky, biochemist, Florida State University tenured
professor, and the parental authority who posted bail for Irwin Nanofsky

the night of July 8, 1984. The elder Nanofsky wasn't pleased that his
son
had been arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, and he became
livid
when Tallahassee police informed him that the Aerostar minivan would be
permanently remanded to police custody.

    Over the course of the next three weeks, Nanofsky penned dozens of
irate
letters to the local police chief, the Tallahassee City Council, the
State
District Attorney and, finally, even to area newspapers. But it was all
to
no avail.

    Under advisement of the family lawyer, Irwin Nanofsky pled guilty to

possession of drug paraphernalia in order to receive a suspended
sentence
and have his juvenile court record sealed. But in doing so, the family
minivan became "an accessory to the crime".  According to Florida State
law,
it also became the property of the Tallahassee Police Department Drug
Task
Force. In time, the adult Nanofsky would learn that there was nothing he

could do legally to wrest the vehicle from the hands of the state.

     Biochem 101: How to design a Cannabis-equivalent citrus plant

    It was in the fall of 1984 that the John Chapman Professor of
Biochemistry at Florida State University, now driving to work behind the

wheel of a used Pontiac Bonneville, first set on a pet project that he
hoped
would "dissolve irrational legislation with a solid dose of reason."
Nanofsky knew he would never get his family's car back, but he had plans
to
make sure that no one else would be pulled through the gears of what he
considers a Kafka-esque drug enforcement bureaucracy.

    "It's quite simple, really," Nanofsky explains, "I wanted to combine

Citrus synthesis with Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol." In layman's terms,
the
respected college professor proposed to grow oranges that would contain
THC,
the active ingredient in marijuana. Fourteen years later, that project
is
complete, and Nanofsky has succeeded where his letter writing campaign
of
yore failed: he has the undivided attention of the nation's top drug
enforcement agencies, political figures, and media outlets.

    The turning point in the Nanofsky saga came when the straight-laced
professor posted a message to Internet newsgroups announcing that he was

offering "cannabis-equivalent orange tree seeds" at no cost via the U.S.

mail. Several weeks later, U.S. Justice Department officials showed up
at
the mailing address used in the Internet announcement: a tiny office on
the
second floor of the Dittmer Laboratory of Chemistry building on the FSU
campus. There they would wait for another 40 minutes before Prof.
Nanofsky
finished delivering a lecture to graduate students on his recent
research
into the "cis-trans photoisomerization of olefins."

    "I knew it was only a matter of time before someone sent me more
than
just a self-addressed stamped envelope," Nanofsky quips, "but I was
surprised to see Janet Reno's special assistant at my door".  After a
series
of closed door discussions, Nanofsky agreed to cease distribution of the

THC-orange seeds until the legal status of the possibly narcotic plant
species is established.

    Much to the chagrin of authorities, the effort to regulate
Nanofsky's
invention may be too little too late. Several hundred packets containing
40
to 50 seeds each have already been sent to those who've requested them,
and
Nanofsky is not obliged to produce his mailing records. Under current
law,
no crime has been committed and it is unlikely that charges will be
brought
against the fruit's inventor.

    Now it is federal authorities who must confront the nation's
unwieldy
body of inconsistent drug laws. According to a source at the Drug
Enforcement Agency, it may be months if not years before all the issues
involved are sorted out, leaving a gaping hole in U.S. drug policy in
the
meantime. At the heart of the confusion is the fact that THC now
naturally
occurs in a new species of citrus fruit.

    As policy analysts and hemp advocates alike have been quick to point

out, the apparent legality (for now) of Nanofsky's "pot orange" may
render
debates over the legalization of marijuana moot. In fact, Florida's top
law
enforcement officials admit that even if the cultivation of Nanofsky's
orange were to be outlawed, it would be exceedingly difficult to
identify
the presence of outlawed fruit among the state's largest agricultural
crop.

Even though the first netmeet isn't until 2:16AM, I make a personal plea
for all of yinz to get to DAWN as early as possible , like at 10PM!  I
should be there at that time as well as many others netters reprezentin
DaMofo.  I don't know if he is on the list anymore but he used to be at
least and unfortunately the email i sent to him at AOL did the old happy
bounce back. :-(

So for all those true HARDCORE, I would say all of DaMofo's set should be
a net-meet.  And if you haven't heard Happy hardcore before, it is a real
jumping happy treat!

Drive safely, and be careful not to get a speeding ticket around
Youngstown like I did on my way to the Depeche Mode show last weekend. :-(

I guess you can tell I am pretty x-cited.

Again this is @ the Crane warehouse in the strip district, same place as
Digital Genesis.  Let's show the Metropol crew that  Ravers can be
responsible so we can have more parties here!

happy happy h-core plur,

jbrick

For immediate release:

Due to unforseen circumstances, Global Communication will not be performing at
Ultraworld's Energize event, November 28th at The DC Armory.

In their place we are very pleased to announce the following addition to 
The House Room:

Strictly Rhythm recording artist

W A M D U E   P R O J E C T

featuring producer CHRIS BRANN
with DJs DEEP C and CHRIS UDOH

Since 1995 Wamdue has been a fixture in America's underground house
movement.  They have released singles on such esteemed labels as:
Peacefrog, StudioK7!, Communique, Sum/Multiply, Love From San Francisco,
Substance, Acacia, Stickmen, Guidance, and Jus' Trax.  Their 1996 Strictly
Rhythm full length "Resource Toolbook Volume 1" was critically praised
worldwide and is considered an all-time classic.  "Program Yourself", their
new album for Strictly Rhythm, has been met with similiar acclaim and is
destined for the best of '98 charts.  Their debut Washington DC appearance
is not to be missed!


Note:
DJ time slots have changed in the main-room.  Please visit www.ultraworld.net
for all the latest updates.

Quick pole (email replies to me directly ONLY please.)

How many of you people can NOT easily access the web on a sudo regular
basis? I have some ideas for organizing netmeets better using the web
and some software im playing with but I dont wanna exclude people if
too many people cant access the web directly.

hey dmencha if thats what u think a party should be like then fuck u.  maybe
you should hang out with a whole bunch of skinheads in a mosh pit at a slayer
concert. if peeps would be bleeding all over the place at a party it would
prolly be the worst vibe on the face of the earth. theres nothing worse than
methed out kids starting shit. if you want to prove that youre the hardest
muthafucka on earth take it elsewhere. we dont need peeps like you in at our
parties. 
oh yeah voodoo3 aint going down like that either!
peace

the article from this past sunday's pittsburgh post-gazette follows.  the ocr
text conversion was a little kooky from the scan but you can get the basic
ideas.

<begin post-gazette article from front page of region section>

Mark Lange had been using a low-grade transmitter to broadcast music to 2,
000 listeners i) South Side, Oakland, Squiwel Hill and Shadyside. Warrant
wrenches radio rebel off the air  
By Rona Kobell Post-Gazette Staff Writer Radio Carson is dead. 
Maybe dead is too harsh a word, bu t agents music—a mixture of
instrumental and synthe
on his unlicensed radio station.
It's not as though Lange didn't kno w what was coming. For three years,
he's been using a low-grade transmit ter to broadcast electroniclm the
Federal Communications Commission siz ed music he says mainstream stations
have ndfU.S. Marshals executed an arrest
 warrant all but ignored—on 91.7 FM in  Pittsburgh. O days ago at Mark
Lange's South Side horne First, he broa dcast frotn an apartment and nd
took away his transmitter. pulling the p lug could only reach the Carson
Street area, but
when he and his wife moved to 2507 Cobden  St which is on a South Side
slope, his listener swelled to 2,000 and i nchlded fans in Squirre Hill,
Shadyside and Oakland. 
Lange liked the arrangement. Local DJ helpe d him mix the dance tunes on
compac 
discs,  and Lange left his 50-disk CD changer on autopilot while he went'
to his d ay job as a technician for a telecommuncations company that he
declined  to name. At night, he would add commentary to the broadcasts and
spin the discs himself.
"It was no thing profane or offensive," Lange said of Radio Carson. "It
was just a music format that wasn't available on any Pittsburgh radio
station."
It might not have been offensive, but it was illegal, federal agents said.
Lange was broadcasting without a license, a violation of the
Communications Act of 1934 and its updated version, the Communications Act of
1996. Under the law, licensed stations must have at least 100 watts of power
to broadcast. Powerhouse Pittsburgh sta
tions WWSW  and WDVE broadcast at close to 50,000 watts.
The FCC does  let some lowpower stations operate, but at 10 watts, Radio
Carson exceeded  the FCC's limit by more than 100 times
l according to  Harry Litman, IJ.S. attorney for the Western Vistrict of
Pennsylvania .	
Litman said that  unlicensed broadcasting "threatens the integrity of the
regulatory structure,"  and that illegal broadcasts such as Lange's might
interfere with licensed broadcasts' public safety messages.
In May, FCC agents visited  Lange and warned him to cease broadcasting.
Lange said he would, but he  refused to put the agreement in •vriting,
Litman said. He continued broadcasting.
"We feel that the Free Radio  movement is a challenge to the FCC," Lange
said. "Free Radio threatens commercial radio's ability to make money."
Lange invested about $4,000  into his station for equipment and operating
expenses. He said that a  commercial license would cost him $100,000 to
$500,000, and operating costs at the larger stations run into the millions.
Lange has been off the air  since the two FCC agents and two U.S marshals
visited him on Oct. 28,  hauling away about $2,000 of his equipment and
warning him that broadcasting  would result in a $10,000 fine and an
arrest for violating a court order.
Lange is not the only pirate  radio broadcaster whose waves have been
clipped by federal agents this  year. Stephen Dunifer has been fighting
the FCC in court since he started  Free Radio Berkeley five years ago in
California. He succeeded until June, when t
he FCC won an injunction and shut him down.
Dunifer said the FCC had stacked  the deck against the small stations in
favor of "the Rupert Murdochs  those with lots of wealth and lots of
clout."
Some small radio stations have  the option of filing for nonprofit status
to cut down on costs, but Dunifer said that religious organizations that
covet the frequencies end up with the best chance of securing the stations
Dunifer estimated that 500 to  1,000 pirate radio stations are operating
in the United States, many of  them in Chicago, New York and Miami. In the
past t vo years, the FCC, vith  the blessing of the Naiional Association
of Broadcasters has cracked down on i
llegal broadcasts, he said.
But all of the stations recentty  shut down in Miami are back on the air,
despite threats of arrests, Dunifer  said. "Shutting a station down is not
going to stop this movernent. This  movement is about free speech. l'he
point is to be an alternative voice i
n the community."
On the Free Radio Network Web site  (www.frn.net), veteran broadcasters
such as Dunifer share their struggle  with movement newcomers. Dunifer
even has a site link to his lawyers,  and Lange is thinking about calling
them. He hopes to take his case to court 
for permission to resume his broadcasts.
"If my role is as a martyr, if I give  this city a taste of what radio
should be and I have to be shut down as  a result, then maybe that's what
we need to make the system change."

Yeah!  Lots of snakes and battle axes and chainmail bras, wwf-style
wrestling bouts, plenty of gaseous HCl, donkey poop shampooed into the

I'm thinking of inviting him back to Pittsburgh soon.  Thoughts?
This might sound funny from the house party girl but what about an all hard

well, im back from dawn, and although i had a *great* time, i gotta say a
few words.. i saw some seriously scary shit happen tonight.  im not gonna
go into details but im sure most of you know what im talking about.  my
friend was punched in the face as  a result of this incident.  this shit
has to stop.  dawn was an awesome party that almost got ruined by a couple
of people who didn't know when to quit, and worse, *didn't have anyone
looking out for them*.  

be safe,
steve.

actually this seems pretty on target for what seems to go through the minds of
those hard core djs i've known or heard about.  they certainly are a strange and
sometimes demented lot.  you'd have to be a bit "different" from the rest of us to
have that stuff pounding in your head day in and day out.

offa grooveriders cd...at first...but it turned out to be great! some of my
favorite tracks...(lots of the stuff that grooverider has on his tapes and
cd's) were played twards the end of my night...<tummy grumble>...
it's also too bad that there was such a wierd vibe rollin around..(maybe
because it;s trillogy) and too bad that more party kids weren't here...come to
think of it...there weren't too many kids there at all!
well...anyway...i hope we start bringing in more bomb-ass junglists...and
throwin doun all the jump-up they can find!

Oh yes, I am very into....DHR, ATR, Empire: The Destroyer, Shizuo and 
the likes (including former list member Ryu's shit).  The hardcore is

this could be true.  anything in excess is bound to have negative effects
on your body.  i personally don't make it a habit of adding a little
splash of echinacea to every meal, just when i'm sick.

Those of you who watch mtv avidly have probably noticed that they're
doing this thing called Campus Invasion.  Being a Big Ten school, they
came to IU. So I went.  They had an experimental music tent in which they
had four computers with different composing programs.  I was a little
pre-occupied with other thoughts so I really didn't check them out.  There
were also lines for the comps.  In the middle of the tent was a set up
that looked like electronic drum pads but they weren't.  You waved your
hands/body parts in front of them and they made sounds.  This little man
was manipulating them.  He put on a really stupid (as in dumb) drum loop
and tried to play symphonic samples in rhythm.  He had no rhythm.  I
suppose in theory it's an interesting idea, he looked like he was
dancing, but you'd have to have one hell of a sense of rhythm to actually
be good at it!  I would also like to say that I feel cheap for having
participated in the mtv invasion.

Request:

When posting about an article in a magazine, please include the date of
the issue.  I've missed at least two articles about 1.8.7. because I
couldn't find the right one (i.e. wrong month, wrong country).  Thank you.

Erin,

This is a good idea.  But when I'm "sick", I find eating the flesh of
healthy people to be even better as a remedy.  The brains work best.  You
can ingest their healthy souls and get a good meal at the same time.  
Kicks the cold right in the ass.

Want to have dinner sometime?

Here goes (not too long this time):

Got there at 12:00 waited in line for a few minutes in the cold . . .
got in, security ppl real cool.

I liked the space a lot . . . it grew on me over the night too.  Good
heat level.

Sound: Well there was supposed to be 4 corner audio, but i guess shit
got fucked up.  overload was coming on when I came in, and honestly
the sound quality was shitty.  Very muddy bass and it just didn't make
you want to dance (not that I'm saying i didn't, but it didn't grab
you and make you dance.)  If you went half way back through the place
all you could hear was a low rumble.  So I was kinda worried, cause
mad heads were there and you could barely hear anything.  But this
kind of fixed itself later on, cause although it may have not been too
great for jungle, it was perfect for house and techno.  gave a nice
warmth to the bass.

DJs:
Overload: runnin' . . . 21st century sound, decent mixing, although
not spectacular.  He played the locuste remix and the entire
dancefloor went nuts calling for the rewind which was supplied with
the help of Andy sine on the mic.

Rowland the Bastard: he was real good . . . but honsetly I was
expecting more.

Frankie Bones: OH MY GOSH!  He tore the place to shreds!  As Frankie
so eloquently put it, "He plays the beatest tracks ever, but pimps
them sooooooooo hard."  and it's true.  the tracks were kind of bland
and repetitive . . . but that was only when he wasn't cuttin up
hardcore (all of five minutes :)  He would create buildups by cuts,
scratch on bleeps to create acid tones . . . whatever.  Def. lived up
to my hopes.

Vibe: well people were being real cool, and someone even mentioned to
me how he liked the attitude of people in pittsburgh.  But it also
wasn't as happy as many other parties (I think due to the extreme lack
of rolls) . . . and then there was that stuff about someone getting
punched??!!  I don't know.

Lights: again I was a little worried at one point.  they just weren't
on at all.  but then they started kickin' it, and they were bomb from
then on.  six lasers, intellibeams, emulators, strobes, the works. Oh
and a HUGE projection screen courtesy of TypeO. (props by the way on
the Tron stuff on the TVs.)

well that's it,

I was chillin most of the night dancin and shit,
around 5 some chinese dude puked near us
i was informed that piss was leaking out of the portapotties
went for a little walk around and noticed some seriously shady shit going
down
me and my friends jetted,
as we were walkin to McD's to wait for my mom to pick us up
there was a drunk ass mufuka pullin his pants down in front of cops
4 cops were there with lights on
as we passed the gravel lot 3 more cops wizzed up with lights and sirens
on.
What kinda shit went down?

Rave was pretty shady IMHO.

 ZMalloc

Reprasentin digital brain,
Mathematical beat precision
on a logical decision to keep it real

ps.
The projection shit was pretty cool, all in time with the beats n' shit :)

DEady Buda does kick big ass though.  I agree I seen him last year at 
Shindig in Pittsburgh(I think).  That was a good time, sometimes little 
parties are all you need.

Arrived on the dot at 10!  Around 10:30 they started letting people in and,
yes oh yes, the Happy Hardcore was in full effekt!

DaMofo: Major props for getting me so pumped so early. No false advertising
here just good old plain fast and happy hardcore.  The whistle crew and
dancing crew kept it real up in front and it was way jumpy jumpy and mixxed
without making me want to lose momentum.  It seemed to end so early and
after this set I can empathize with the want to have an all Hardcore party!

Kevin Cunningham:  After the Happy H-Core it was a bit of a letdown, but
some nice minimal beats.  I don't think it was a standard Ghetto Booty
House Set as I don't remember hearing the standard vulgarities of the
genre.  perhaps he was just keeping it cleen.

During his set I got to check out the space and it was basically the same
as the Digital Genesis setup, though only 1/2 the Warehouse was used. The
sound did seem very spotty as you moved back, but that blame would have to
goto the acoustics of the space, while looking just fabulous wasn't made to
handle 40k or more of sound.  The port-o-johns were in the back, and the
glowstickintheportojohn would have been a good idea.

Overall the heaters hung from the ceiling did their job and I felt very
comfortable.  Probably due to the fact that the sound was only 'ON' in the
immediate area around the front stage, the vibe in the back seemed awkward
and dislocated from the main sonic assault.

The Type-O crew had their gear set up smack dab in da middle of tings,
which was also nice to see the multiple TV's they had setup.  The varied
imagery worked really well with all the DJ sets and yes like Absolut
pointed out the TRON cyber-cycle racing scenes were way phat!

Overload: DJ Sine came on the mic and thanked K Cunningham and gave
Overload more than a warm junglist welcome. The whistle crew and lighta
crew represented to his techy blend of jungle.

Roland the Bastard: Techno! Techno! Techno! Probably the easiest set of the
night I could relate to and with the bank of lights above the stage turned
on the vibe seemed to extend a bit further back, props go out to those who
did the setup absolutely beautiful.

Frankie Bones: My first time hearing him and I was far from dissapointed!
Definitely a master of tweaking and mixing although yet maybe even perhaps
because of the acoustics things sounded a bit minimal.  If you liked his
set his new cd "Technolo-G" will being a smile to your face.

Heather Heart:  Though I chilled for most of her set it was BEAU-T_FUL!
Uplifting again in a sort of minimal fashion.  I enjoyed this a lot more
than her set at Metropol and am very glad I got to see her spin at a real
party. I wouldn't have minded if she spun til Dawn. Ok!

O'Sheen: Ok he took the control of the decks and immediately a voluptuous
blonde dancer started grinding against him.  I have never seen this kind of
cutting up before and at first I was kinda annoyed but he didn't play on
this cheese factor, and the crowd seemed to enjoy it.  the first time ever
I have seen a seemingly planned Go-go Dancer for a DJ, anyone seen this
kinda action before?

O'Sheen just kept getting better and bettah as his set progressed and I
loved the way he seemed to play and get pumped with the crowd.  he brought
us into the Sunshine and Dawn had yes, arrived! 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and back!

Smartie: Started into some funky breaky beats, but alas I was tired and
needed to get to bed and dream of sheep.

Shout out to all the net-raver crew I ran into who seemed to enjoy the
skillz but again disappointed a bit with the acoustics.  Props to the
Wizard Workshop and Midnight blue for doing the Best Possible with what was
available.  Honestly though if you were up be the stage things sounded just
fine.

Lastly a big thanks to John B. aka Product 19 and the House Of Styles for a
really enjoyable warehouse party live from the strip district.  Whereas
Digital Genesis had bigger names, honestly I felt the vibe was better here
despite the complications! [Heh, it was Fridday the 13th, things couldn't
have gone that smoothly.] Thanx.

pLuR,

jbrick

I'd be interested in being involved on any level - i've got lots of
hardcore contacts...and fuck yeah i'd spin!

With Buda there's no worry about getting folks to show up either, because
that cat is legendary - and he also comes through every time to boot!

man, i hate hardore. it sounds like noise for speed freaks. why would anyone ever
want to have a rave with all hardcore? it doesnt support the necessary elements of
peace, love, unity, and respect that i have come to expect from the rave scene.
plus hardcore kills my roll, and just makes me feel all depressed. gimme more
house, downlow!

that dancer has seen plenty of dj action.  when she turns 18 she can finally
earn money for what she does.  she really performs back at the hotel, i'm told.

so here goes my dawn review...
got there at 10:30, got in at 11. da mofo was everything i was hoping
for. i was very impressed...after his set i just chilled for a while. 
main points: frankie bones was a huge disappointment. i thought his set
was awful. heather heart wasn't as bad, but sort of a disappointment as
well. roland the bastard was alright, got me dancing. 
i went to sleep for a while and when i woke up it was light out. smartie
came on and came *this close* to inspiring me to get off the floor. 
all in all, this rave was a disappointment to me. i went home in a bad
mood. oh well...

I knew that it would be a night of great music... I myself got violently ill
Friday night, and couldn't even MOVE until this morning. But I bet it was hard
to choose between the three great events around the pb-cle area on Friday
night: Ani/Dara at Trilogy, Love of Life in Akron, and Dawn in Pitt.
Discomafia (who brought you dj Ani and Dara) will have several events coming
up on Fridays in the near future, so look out for those. I will post them this
week. Hope everyone had fun this weekend!!!  -Casey-

Dawn was an awesome party.  I had a great time.  I got there around
10:30 and I guess they werent letting headz in yet cause I waited in
line for a long time.  By the time I got in, Da Mofo's set was almost
over.  I only caught about fifteen minutes of it:( but what I heard
was chronic!  I didnt really like Kevin Cunningham's set.  It just
seemed sort of plain especially cause I was in the mood for some happy
hardcore!  Overload wasnt bad, but my favorite DJ of the nite was
Roland the Bastard!  Holy shit this guy hooked up a bomb set!  And he
wasnt even on the flyer. I had been looking forward to Frankie Bones
the most but I think I liked Roland the Bastard a bit more.  But I'm
not saying I didnt enjoy Frankie Bones cause I sure as hell did.  He
had many many skillz!  His tracs werent all that good, but his mixing
was incredible!  I left about half way through Heather Heart's set. 
She had skillz too!  Her mixes were sutle and on.  I enjoyed her trac
selection too.  I wish I'd been able to see Osheen and Smartie spin,
but I had to dip.

Shoutz out to the list members I met: Patty, Trout Soup, Jade, Kelly,
Stephan(?), and that fist guy I met whose name I forget. David maybe? 
Sorry if I forgot anyone else, and of course shoutz out to all the
headz I already know and love to see: Andy the Pooh, Andy the brew,
Tom, Spyboy, jbrick, and I'm sure I'm forgetting people.  Oh well, you
know who you are.

Anyway, I had a great time and so did my friend.  It was his first
party and he loved it!  I'm always glad to bring someone else into the
seen!

Peace,
Josh

FYI: The most recent article on 1.8.7. appears in the December (I think) 
SPIN magazine.  Busta Rhymes is on the front cover. Hope that helps.

I'm listening to the Bad Boy Bill/
Richard "Humpty" Vission
"House Connection."
It kicks ass.
(Thanks Case!)

You jungle peeps:
At the end there is this jungle track that kicks ass.
It's "Wishing on a Star."
I think it's one of those slightly smaller 
records (9"?)
with a star on the center.
I saw some fat ass DJ spin it at 
FA4, in the pavillion.
I've never seen a fat DJ pigging out while
spinning till then.  It was obscene.

Yeah it is.  (It's a 10" though)

It's probably available through smile comm. still.  I ordered one a
while ago.  It's well worth it.  Prob. my favorite jungle track of all

we have the same thing in boston.  club/bar owners/managers claim that
they do not want high school students sneaking out of their homes and
going.  this was funny because i showed him a boston university ID and he
had nothing to say and still wouldn't let me in.  fuck him, i snuck in an
hour later anyway. or it could be that dramatic behavioral change that
occurs when one turns 19 that gives patrons of the club that distinct air
of homogeniety and dullness.

HEY EVERYBODY!  (said like the world reknowned Dr. Nick Rivera from the
Simpsons!) 

I'm on a few mailing lists and one of them discusses higher states of
consciencess and out-of-body states...........The letter that I'm including is
CRAZY!!!!!!!!!   Read it...and make your own conclusions!

Jason



Hi Everyone,

Have you seen the movie The Fifth Element starring Bruce Willis and
that pretty brunette. It is about blasting away an alien spaceship
using 5 element configurations. Now here in The Thirteenth Vortex and
it is based on reality. It will be used to dock with the Heavenly
Spaceship or the City of Light (or the "Heavenly Jerusalem" or "New
Jerusalem"). Recently. I read about Dee web site and the stuff by Alan
de Walton concerning some people who have indeed see this "New
Jerusalem". Also by Enoch and Kent about the Solar connection, etc.. 
Could the City of Light really be based on fact??  In this message. I'd 
like to share stuff about it for those who haven't heard of it and seeking for
verifications from those with third sight about the Thirteenth Vortex
and the "New Jerusalem". If it is based on truth. It's gonna be more
fantastic than The Fifth Element. If it is not based on truth. Then it
is another one of those Hale Bopp companion and EQ Pegasus stuff (and
I'll disconnect from the Internet for a couple of years to clean my
head from all the disinformation).  Well. Anyone knows the coordinates of
Yucatan and Mexico? The Thirteenth Vortex is said to be located there.
Let's ask Remote Viewers to survey those places and see what they can
come up with. Also if anyone can supply pictures of the places. Please
do as I'd like to let Remote Viewers here in my country to do likewise.

                                       THE THIRTEENTH VORTEX

1. QUESTION: MUCH DISCUSSION HAS CENTERED OF LATE AROUND THE 12+1
PRIMARY SITES, CENTERS, VORTEXES. WHY 12+1, AND WHAT IS THEIR PURPOSE
FOR BEING WHERE THEY ARE?

The twelve energy sites with its thirteenth compliment are in fact
those primary centers in which the earth harmonic patterns are most
visible and are most effective relative to the transition activities.
By this we mean that there are certain points on the Planet which play
a major role for the transition by "anchoring" the Light as you term
it. It is at those sites that those who are in harmony with the
specific patterns which are projected from the higher realms will
gather and make their transition. The thirteenth site is a harmonic
tuning fork which will, in effect, be used to fine tune all energy
patterns in the final days. It is at the thirteenth site that the beam
ship "New Jerusalem" will dock and bring about that which is necessary
for the completion of the planetary program now in effect.

2. These sites are most significant for those who hold the
responsibility of "anchoring" the Light as they will represent the
focal points for the energy patterns t- be held within the earth
plane.

3. QUESTION: HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE A SACRED SITE?

Sacred sites are those areas where vortexes intersect with the
surface of the planet.

4. QUESTION: HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHICH ONE TO SEEK FOR?

One is drawn to certain sites because the Light patterns within their
human encoding has a corresponding relationship with the ra - of that
Light pattern.

5. QUESTION: PLEASE DISCUSS THE "+1" IN MORE DETAIL..

The thirteenth vortex, characterized as "+l," holds a special role in
Earth's transition process. It is sometimes referred to as the energy

"capstone," for not only does it contain all of the encoding of the
past and present planetary cycles, it also holds the activation codes
that initiate the final sequence of events for the Ascension of the
planet into the dimensions beyond. It is here that a "new" Light
pattern is being projected the at provides for all that exists within
the third dimension.

6. This thirteenth ray is equivalent to a grand tuning fork that
resonates the vibratory frequencies represented in the fourth
dimension so that all third dimension creation can tune to the next
octave of existence. Entities who visit the vortexes, will be affected
by the higher frequency Light projections. If they are in harmony with
the energies when they depart, they will in turn become tuning forks
for others who come into their presence.

7. When Jesus Christ walked on earth, this is what others felt, and
healing took place directly from contact with these higher
frequencies. In order to be a similar conduit for these energies, it
is necessary to remain clear and balanced in all respects: physically,
emotionally, mentally and spiritually.

8. High above the thirteenth vortex, know that within this area,
residing in the fourth dimension, there is afloat a great vehicle of
Light. Some refer to this as an energy mass, while others call it a
CITY OF LIGHT.

9. QUESTION: WHY IS IT THERE?

This great ship is such a powerful energy force that it cannot enter
the Earth's third dirnension without adversely affecting the life
streams. As such, its maximum densification is within the fourth
dimension for as long as necessary to complete its purpose. Its
immediate responsibility is to anchor, monitor, and adjust the
incoming energies and to accommodate souls who make the transition.

10. QUESTION: YOU ARE SPEAKING OF "THE NEW JERUSALEM," ARE YOU NOT?

That is correct. It has come forth from the Moon. It has arrived in
the area of Mexico and will be that which will influence the final
transition of Earth into the fourth dimension.

11. QUESTION: IS THIS WHAT IS ALSO CALLED THE GREAT PEARLY WHITE CITY?

There will be many great Cities of Light coming forth into the
planetary consciousness during the latter days. It is enough to know
now that this great ship, which we refer to as The New Jerusalem is
that Which will be instrumental in the final changes.

12. QUESTION: WHY DOES IT COME TO MEXICO PER SE?

it is here that the planet is in perfect balance and therefore is able
to make the transition, so to speak. At that point on the planet,
there is a perfect balance between the positive and negative energy
forces which makes up all that is known as Creation. Within all of
Creation there are points of perfect balance whereby Creation is able
to go forward beyond its existing state. When gaseous matter achieves
its state from that of water, it accomplishes that at a specific
boiling point whereby the balance i s achieved to move beyond its
current state.

13. We have difficulty bringing you information that is very
multidimensional in nature. To illustrate, when you are in perfect
balance with your own energies, you are able to bring forth a higher

state of consciousness. Earth has an energy point within its
structure, that when brought into perfect balance with its greater
self has the ability to transcend its current evolutionary state.

14. Mexico represents that point whereby the harmonics necessary for
this process can be put into place that will resonate throughout the
rest of the planet. Mexico is the starting point of this process
because of its specific origination to the GREAT CENTRAL SUN when the
Earth is in its Divine position within the Galaxy. There is no other
point on the planet which will be in direct alignment with the
inter-dimensional pathways to the GREAT CENTRAL SUN.

15. It is the area of the Yucatan Peninsula in the heart of a triad of
pyramids. The center of the Ship will be far to the north, but this is
the targeting area for docking the craft. Its pointing relationship to
the heavens is with your own Moon. The Moon is already in sync with
the GREAT CENTRAL SUN; the Earth orientation is what we speak of here.
The Earth still remains in her correct orbit to the sun, but it is
within the context of the Moon that we now speak.


Sacred Yucatan Part 14

1. QUESTION: ANY FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS SHIP?

This body of energy has often also been termed a "beam ship,,, meaning
that it is capable of "beaming" itself around while in the past
stationed within the Earth's Moon. It was a vehicle of support for
those who were making the rounds, so to speak, during their many life
incarnations on Earth. Having departed its previous location, it is
prepared now for a final docking sequence with fourth dimensional
Earth in the region of Yucatan. The energy force responsible for the
Earth's dimensional transition will b e used for this process, plus
the anchoring of the third dimensional personnel who are called to
this mission. New Jerusalem will support the transition of fourth
dimensional Earth into its fifth dimensional counterpart and its
subsequent relocation to a multi-sun system. It is a complex energy
force relationship, with all that exists within the Universe, that
prevents Mother Earth from making her rapid changes and to free her
from the bonds of her sun and subsequently to allow her to transport
to the multi-sun system.

2. We are unable to compare this City of Light to one of your planets
as requested, because it does not hold the mass, or the density, of
the planets, and thus a comparison would be of little help to you. As
mentioned before. it is a living organism that has the capacity to
expand or contract or change form as necessary. It is a ship
nonetheless, but well beyond the description outside of this linear
terminology. We might add that you are going to be moving outside of
this linear terminology in the near fut ure. It is time to allow your
inner feelings to take over where words leave off.
                 
3. This glorious NEW JERUSALEM holds the magnetic properties to
balance all Earth energies. It is this ship which has recently been
seen of late by those who are capable of looking within the next
dimension. Its size is beyond belief for those holding third
dimensional perspective. Its brilliance is beyond anything known to

man and its energy force exceeds that of anything within the system.
4. QUESTION: IF WE PUBLISH THIS ABOUT YUCATAN, ISN'T THAT GOING TO
BRING FLOODS OF SCARED UNAWAKENED PERSONS AND A CROWD OF REAL ESTATE
BROKERS AS IN SEDONA?

No real estate brokers are involved in this one. You can print the
material received from us knowing full well that all has been taken
care of.

5. QUESTION: OUR GOVERNMENT NOW HAS TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT TO
MEASURE AND IDENTIFY DIMENSIONAL ENERGIES, SUCH AS AN E.T. BEING, ETC.
WOULD THEY NOT ALSO BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE PRESENCE OF THIS GREAT
CRAFT?

We have absolute control over all information that is received by the
monitors of your government and others. They are given only that which
is necessary to satisfy their curiosity, so to speak, and that which
is used by 0 ur ships of Light.

6. QUESTION: DOES THIS ONE DOCKING PENETRATE ITS ENERGIES OR PURPOSE
THROUGHOUT THIS HEMISPHERE, THE PLANET, OR ARE THERE OTHERS AS WELL
AND ARE YOU PERMITTED TO DISCUSS THEIR LOCATIONS?

There will be several duckings as you have reported in Project World
Evacuation. The significant of this great MOTHER SHIP in the Yucatan
area is centered around the fact that all other ships are a function
of this one. In other words, the Yucatan docking represents the lead
sequence of events for the others to follow. There is no need to be
concerned about reporting more on the other landings. These are all
secondary in nature and are well known by those who are involved with
them on the surface plane. The need to know about this ship of ships
is what is important now, for it is a critical time to the soul
awakenings of those of you who must fulfill your mission to anchor
this docking.

7. QUESTION: "WE ARE THEN NOW PERMITTED TO RELEASE THIS INFORMATION
CONCERNING THIS HAPPENING?

That is correct. This is an occasion that each soul most resonate to
for only those who are capable of knowing will be able to do so
regardless of how the information is presented in the third dimension
* You are given that which is necessary for your readers to respond to
within their inner Being.

8. It should be explained that all will not be ready and therefore
usable to digest these things, but that the material is to be held
within their inner mind for a time until their fuller awareness and
all knowingness enables them to resonate properly with it. The
information is sent to many for decoding their inner consciousness and
assisting their awakening process. As they think on these things and
take thern into a process of meditation, certain realizations will be
pulled through their souls toward a g reater knowingness. It is enough
to know that the first of the Great Cities is positioning itself for
coming events and that gifted ones may indeed look upon it.

9. We do not at this time intend to get into any further revelation of
the whereabouts, description or activities of the others. This is that
one which is beaming forth the rays and the energies that will bring
into full manifestation energies required for those who have chosen
that pathway.


10. QUESTION: CAN YOU RELEASE ITS DIAMETER, ETC.?

As explained earlier, it is not a linear vessel, it is a living vessel
of Light, multidimensional in its own essence, but we can say that it
certainly does cover you'. entire area called the Gulf of Mexico.

Music: ( what I saw, heard, paid attention to )

Well last night was the first time I had seen mc flipside and freaky flow.
They were fuckin awesome. Sounded like some rasta jungle, then they played
some old skool Biz Markie which was pretty cool. Im not big on hiphop or
jungle, but they had me dancin. Went downstairs and Joe Blunt was playing,
pretty good set...mixture of everything..alot of house. Titonton came on.
His whole thing was really amazeing. He had a drummer, violin, ect ect...it
was beautiful. Pretty mellow...not really my thing, but like I said it was
amazeing. My favorite dj of the night goes to the person that was playing
last in the "main area". Was that acidpimp? Whoever it was, was the fucking
shit.

Well the party started at 11, however they didn't let people in until a
little after 1am. The security/cops were bastards. There was no smoking
allowed...which I understand, It was a nice venue...but for us smokers that
was pure hell. They took your smokes at the door. I saw some kids getting
hassled/searched/thrown out. They kept lights on which blew. I saw argueing,
people pushing each other and getting in each others face. All in all it was
a shitty time, Im not really placing blame on the party...but I have
definately seen better times.

BLaH
Amy

Yeah...these are her, too:

And speaking of taking pictures of women: do you think you took enough of
Heather Heart, Don? ;) 

I thought it was an interesting contrast that O'Sheen came on after
Heather. She's this tiny little woman who did this minimal, melodic set,
and then he's this big, athletic-looking guy who got up there and started
pounding out these powerful beats. It was as if the busty blonde dancer
was there to demonstrate how much testosterone he was exuding.

at all possible to let my friend Tom participate in this event.  He taught
me how to spin and he is very good.  Tom and I also know Jon from Teknova.
If you are going contact Jon he should be able to confirm this.  But, the
final decision is up to you.  I was hoping to get him some well-deserved
publicity.  Please take this into serious consideration.  Please let me
know asap.  You can reply to this message.  Thank you.

P.S.  We have EVERYTHING accept for a heavy duty orange extension cord.  We
will keep trying to find one.

. All in all it was
>a shitty time, Im not really placing blame on the party...but I have
>definately seen better times.

I would have to agree.
I didn't get there till 3:30.
The main reason we went was to pass out flyers.
They made us pay full price to get in.
The party was shut down at 6 AM.
So I drove 3 hours and paid 25$ for 2 1/2 hours of not_ so_ great party.
I'm not  extremely happy about that. I only wanted to get in for half price.
I think that would have been more than fair.  They should have lowered the
price for everyone. Especially if it didn't even start till 1 AM. I
understand that promoters have to cover their costs, but sometimes you lose
money. That's all there is to it.
Sorry if I sound like a bitch, but that's just what I think.

The music was REALLY< REALLY good, though! I wish I could have heard more...

Love,
Amber

Ok, I should not have been joking

I'm sorry.  I don't really treat anyone that

Yeah, Navigate wasn't the best party, but it had it's moments.  There were
a few big problems with the party, but others have already talked about
them.  I was disappointed with Claude Young's set.  I'm sure it woulda been
great, but if you weren't right in front of the speaker, you ended up
hearing the bass from the jungle in the next room seep over.  Frustrating.

The two racquetball courts in the back held their sound better, but were so
hot!  Anyway, I heard a couple of good sets in here.  Lemon Lyman sounded
amazing, laying down records teetering on the line between house and
techno.  I don't think this guy makes mistakes any more.  I can't remember
the name of the other one I liked; he played live around 1 or 2 AM.  One
the front of his machine was a (K)NOB sticker.  A while back someone gave
me a (K)NOB record, and it was pretty bland.  This kind of techno sounds
much more vital hearing it live than hearing it locked into vinyl.

Oh well, the big Collective Intelligence parties usually end up going off
better than this one.  Just have to wait until the next one.  All in all, I
had more fun after the party at Matt's (Ratfink), possibly the best host on
the list!

Even though there were a lot of bad circumstances surrounding navigate, i had
a really great time.  Yeah, it sucked that the lights had to be on, but most
people got used to it after a while.  there were plenty of great kids having a
good time and making the best out of a bad situation.

hehe...

i was thinkin about the {pb-cle} rave that's being thrown.

remember the deadly buda vs. dieselboy flame war? why not make em
battle it out on the decks? we could call it "the flame war: final
chapta" and the crowd could decide the winner. that would settle it
once and for all :)

...frankie g

ps - no i dont actually think we should do this, but it would be cool :)

ok. due to the overwhelmingly positive response to my tape offer
(about 40 or 50 so far), sending out so many is going to take a WHILE,
maybe a few months. but yes i am still going to send all of them. i am
not hi-speed dubbing, which lowers the sound quality, and i can only
dub 1 at a time. i fixed the problem with the volume level. the first
5 pack i bought is almost done, then i'll send those, buy another 5
pack of blanks, + start on them. so don't worry if you asked for one
i'm not forgetting. once i sort thru all the responses, i'm going to
put them into a list and then once a month or so, i'll forward a
message to those addresses saying how far i got so then you will know
when to expect the tape.

I sent a money order to pay for a speeding ticket (in Ohio). the
amount was for a couple $'s over the correct amount due. The place I
sent it to,  returned the money order and made me send in a new one
for the right amount. I wasn't even trying to get out of paying the
fine. Just being assholes I guess! Maybe it would have worked
differently if I had sent a check?

My 2 cents on the subject

hiyas! i picked this up off of mw-raves, originally from sf-raves. it's good to know that peeps are starting to hear about these fuckers, so maybe we cann all come together and get rid of this tumor in our scene. 
____________________________________________________________



all I can really add to all that was said is FUCK BTS!!!!!!!
I hope those punk-ass bitches go down HARD!!!!


Hi Rave Friends,

        The new issue of Details magazine has a depressing 5-page story (starting on p. 156) about a gang called BTS (Big Time Shitheads) that's been ruining East coast raves by robbing and beating up ravers and selling fake drugs.  They killed one twenty year old by selling him a mix of drugs
including a horse tranquilizer as Ecstasy.

        The article, by a British freelance writer named Frank Owen with help from Ethan Brown, is a great piece of reporting.  I strongly recommend it.

        Besides talking to Frankie Bones and a bunch of other people for the story, Owen actually interviews some of the "members" of this bunch of lowlife scumbags, and it's pretty fascinating.  They spill the beans about their specifc tactics and how they make thousands of dollars fucking other people over.

        One BTS "leader" says, "I'll go to a club or a rave wearing something nice and flashy -- like a loose-fitting Sergio Tacchini warm-up suit and a matching hat.  I'll sell a couple pills of E and K, until I spot somebody else sellling, and I'll jack them for their money and their drugs, y'know what I'm saying?  Then I'll go into one of the back rooms and I'll change."

        "Underneath the sweat suit, I might be wearing a pair of jeans and a Polo shirt.  I'll take my hat off and laet my hair down or tie it up in a ponytail.  I'll go back out on the dance floor and sell the drugs I just stole.  After an hour or two, I'll rob somebody else and go to the bathroom and change again.  Under the jeans I'll be wearing a nice pair of shorts or something.  Under the shirt, I'll have a tank top.  I'll also put on a different hat.  I store the spare clothes in a tote bag, then hand it to a member of my crew, who gives me my other tote bag with a new outfit in it."

        Another BTSer reports, "I even had cops robbing kids for me!  I swore I was a promoter and pointed out all the drug dealers [and said they'd stolen my money].  The cops were taking their mon ey and giving it to me."

        Not the kind of thing it's nice to hear about, but something we should be aware of to try to prevent it from happening here.  (Makes me glad to be in S.F. and not N.Y.)  Because it could happen here; maybe it already is.  Any details on the kid who got stabbed at the Quest party
Saturday?

        Even thoroughly searching people at the door isn't going to eliminate a bunch of gang members coming in with the intent to jump people, beat them up and rob them.  In fact it's been speculated elsewhere (and I seem to recall backed up by evidence, although I can't vouch for that) that
increasing security such as metal detectors at schools may *increase* the violence because it creates the presumption that violence will occur. Better to focus on throwing parties with vibe so thick that violent lowlife criminals don't show up because they'd feel out of their element, or if they do show up they'll stick out like a sore thumb.

        What makes for a good vibe has been discussed lots before here.  Of course the people who attend the rave really determine the vibe, but the promoters set the tone for an event and can strongly influence it one way or the other.

        Promoters who aren't selective in how they advertise their parties, promoters who try for a cool image rather than a friendly one, promoters who are in it primarily for the money and therefore project that mentality, should think about the fact that they might be indirectly responsible for
someone being beaten up or even killed at one of their parties.  Do you want to live with that, not to mention the possible legal repercussions?

        Might be interesting to tune in to NYC-raves, as I expect this article is sure to be (now or soon) a topic of discussion.  Anyone on the list familiar with East Coast (particularly New York) raves has any personal knowledge or experiences with BTS or other people/venues mentioned
in the article?

Be safe & have fun,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

P.S. - On a more positive note, the same issue of Details has a great feature story (p. 54) on the annual tomato fight that happens in a little town in Spain.  Also an ad for Camel cigarettes (pages 46-47) which I've seen elsewhere but I think is absolutely hilarious, not to mention clever
with its subtle message that driving kills more people than smoking.

I'm very pleased with it.
I will be making copies now,

Or, if you are at the Sheraton tomorrow

Just to let you know, you probably wont be able to find this issue anywhere on
the news stands now because I just picked up the lastest issue of Details..
(Dec-the music issue) which did not feature these articles...  Although it
does have two little snippets about chem bros. and the crystal method (which
was a lil.... hmm.. interesting what they had to say about vegas :\  )

Well, considering that almost EVERYONE drives, but only a percentage
of the population smokes ... and of that smoking bunch, about 60% die
from their habit... Hmm, and while I'm on it, I wonder how many people
know that percentage wise, you're better off shooting smack than
smoking cigarettes.

hey everyone id like to help clearify the situation..... after i read the
email i talked to a few of my friends from nyc... a bunch of the kids even
knew peeps involved with bts..everyone told me the same thing- DONT WORRY
ABOUT BTS!! its not that bad. they may sell fake drugs and do shady things but
its not as widespread and as bad as it seems... all it takes is common sense
to avoid these kids.. be safe and buy drugs from someone u know and someone
youve bought drugs from before.. if youre knew to the scene make sure to meet
some kids at smaller parties where bts is not around.. i know it seems scary
to imagine a group of people robbing, beating up and selling lethal drugs but
its not all that... u can avoid them and prolly wont even notice them.....
stay out of their way if they you see em!! even with this the vibe in some nyc
parties are still going strong, but i knwo the scene there is nothing like it
was!!
ill be going to a nyc party at the end of december so ill see first hand/
peace
plur

Umm... 50,000 smoke-related deaths a year, 3700 deaths related to second hand
smoke... 3000 teens start smoking everyday.. and 90% of smokers start as

By the way "Take the A Train" is a Glenn Miller instrumental from the 1940's i
don't know if any of you guys would want to mix it with a RAVE beat..you might
just start a new style of music

<< hi Guys and gals and everybody in between, i have wanted to throw a house
 party ever since i moved in about a year ago, so i saw that there was kind of
 an open date on SAT NOVEMBER 21, 1998.  I usually name my parties, this one
 will be called "Take the A Train-a collection of my favorite hits".  i can
 only have about 30 or so kids over and it would be nice if we could set up
 some tables for yunz guyz who want to spin.  as usual i will hand out bags
 loaded with toys, light sticks, and lots of candy and other stuff to make the
 party enjoyable.  i will be printing up some flyers soon, please "E"-mail me
 directly at MrRab@AOL.com if you are interested or would like to spin.
 the party will be in the
 pitsburgh area hope to hear from you soon. p.L.u.R. {;-[)+< mark

Ok

I came early or so I thought 11:00pm.  I had tix already.  So I waited 
and waited and waited until 1am with out a jacket, freezin my asss off(I 
am sick as hell now).

Anyways, we all got in eventually.  I felt bad I think all the problems 
had to  do with the fire laws.  No cigs(when I just started smokin 
again), lights must stay on(I could see myself and everyone could see 
me), cool lights will not take effect(I didn't see any amazing lasers 
like I was hearing of).  So I had an alright time.  

I went with a friend who wanted to leave at 4am that sucked.  I enjoyed 
the music thoroughly. At one point I was dancing like a freak, mostly on 
the jungle side.  Crazy jUngle mc rasta man kick it. fun stuff. I am 
unfortunately on a non-roll streak to get my serotonin 
back(hopefully--or at least keep it). I felt kinda self conscious for 
some strange reason.  OH well.

Wish i seen more list kids.  Just seen Matt(ratfink), liz(veggie), Ken 
Boone and that is about all.  Missed a meet if it existed.  Sorry I 
didn't say bye guys I was forced to go--right after Titonton's live set 
with viola and stuff.  I guess it mellowed my friend too much out and we 
lost out natural highs.  It was good though, just not the right moment.  

All and all the vibe was awesome that I received.

Next time will be better. 


Sorry amber I didn't see ya

And everyone else also.

I think that one should be multiplied by 10 (500,000). Otherwise,
looks about right.

      um, some of you may have noticed a pre-flyer for
      something called 'signal'. this is a pittsburgh
      party being thrown by some random person that
      just happens to have a really nice venue, a decent
      attitude, and not all that much knowledge of the
      scene. so we're doing promotional support for him
      at the moment. the full flyer should come out this
      weekend; you can see it at:

      http://www.futureconsortium.com/signal

Yo Andy!  So I hear you're lookin fer 
some shoes...
Get crosstrainers or running shoes.
They feel really good.
Would Adidas be a good recomendation?
(Or Nike, but I wouldn't be caught dead 
 wearing that brand.)

Or you could stick some slabs of duct tape
to the bottom of your feet.
This method costs approx. 11 cents per foot!
Plus it's really trendy!

I apologize if this got posted already, but my isp has been a bit
disfunctional lately, and so I'm not sure if it got sent or not.




        If anyone is looking for something to do in pgh on saturday
there's gonna be a real good hip-hop-a-licious show @ carnegie-mellon.
black star's coming on the 21st to rangos hall in the university center
@ 9.  tix are $5 w/ cmu id and $8 otherwise.  if you don't know anything
about black star they are talib kweli and mos def.  They're one of the
most promising new acts to lift hip-hop oout of it's rut.  They're stuff
transcends the normal "bitches & gangstas" bs, and the record they're
promoting has some poetry that's actually readable out of context.  if
you're interested in hip-hop at all, come out and support them and
intelligence in hip-hop in general.  it's gonna be a good show, I
promise!

c ya,

No bloody way.  Get yourself a pair of the old-school fifth-grade

nefs are your dead homiez... usually used as in "on tha nefs"
(swearing on your dead homiez)... 

"those soudns were bomb! nefs!" = "those sounds were bomb! i swear to
god!"

does anyone know what the modifier "tito" means when it it used with neffs
(the later variation with two l's).  tito is pronounced "tee-dooh".  and
these are just wicked confusing:

neffs on the rael (real)
tito neffs
neffs

we know that neffs generally reinforces the objdct/person...i just can't
tackle the tito.  i think it is like plus (in french) or very (in
english).  if you mix french with slang, you create:

tres neffs -- tito neffs
trop neffs -- tito neffs -- too neffs (not used often)
neffs dans la realite -- neffs on the rael
neffs

"ike", by the way, is now archaic.  if used, you will be looked at like
you are not down/out of loop/lame/honkey.

Actually the greyhound station in Cleveland is definately not nice-very near 
downtown, on Chester.  ~1 mile from tower city, but a dark mile.  No clue 
where the venue will be.  Probably in the burbs.  When's the fiesta? I might 
be coaxed out of retirement.

oh yeah...I think that's the place where my friends and I stopped at for
lunch last time in cleveland.  In half an hour in daylight we saw a guy
(not police) wearing a gun in a shoulder holster, and my friends got
called bitches.  There were thick bars on _every_ window, which never
seems to be a positive message, either.

admittedly, I didn't spend much time there, but that's not a place I
would want to be after dark.  Maybe I'm just a wimp...

Since I haven't heard of anything happening on the date listed on the
flyer (very nice flyer by the way) I called the info. line to see what
it was all about.  The voice on the line went through the line-up city
by city.  I know of 2 of the DJs from Pittsburgh and I'm confused as to
why it says that Tim Zelch is from Ohio.  He is most definitely from
Pittsburgh and although he made a mistake of having faith in the charity
event this weekend and went there to spin (never spun, never got paid),
he's learned his lesson. It's very strange that a promoter wouldn't even
know what city a DJ he has booked is from.  If nothing else this is lazy
and completely unacceptable.  There is too much going on in this city
right now for someone to crawl out of the woodwork and throw an
"insta-party".  We have a good network of support going here and for
someone to completely ignore it and choose to call on someone that isn't
even from Pittsburgh to promote for them??  Seems fishy to me.  This
isn't meant to be a gripe session.  I just know for a fact that some
people see a nice flyer and might assume that a responsible crew is
behind it.  I'm here to call it as I see it.  Watch out for this one.

actually not.  this person has called 3 promoters that i know of asking
for phone numbers of headliner DJs, out of the blue.  when asked who he
was and what he was planning he was rude and wanted to know "what it
mattered who he was".  this doesn't even qualify as a "decent" attitude
in my book.

i can't count the number of "random people" that have thrown one party
and vanished into the darkness where they came from.  they care nothing
about those of us who have worked hard to unify things and work
together.  this is not promoter wars.  it's about working together.
there aren't a lot of things that get to me.  this does.

> and not all that much knowledge of the

this is not an attack on geekboy.  i hope you're charging good money for
your great work.

it all depends on who you are with, and what time ya get there..
it is not a terrible area, as it is near the playhouses and stuff
they got lots of cops, but the cops dont like anyone under 30...
plus once i was dropping off a bud there, and this huge scary looking guy
starts yelling at me, i thought he was insane and about ready to kill me,
but he just wanted to warn me my lights were on... 
well that was a meaningless answer anyway *grinz*

"Strempf ike tito on the nefs"--- go for it

andythejew



does anyone know what the modifier "tito" means when it it used with
             neffs 
             (the later variation with two l's).  tito is pronounced "tee-dooh".  and 
             these are just wicked confusing: 

             neffs on the rael (real) 
             tito neffs 
             neffs 

             we know that neffs generally reinforces the objdct/person...i just can't 
             tackle the tito.  i think it is like plus (in french) or very (in 
             english).  if you mix french with slang, you create: 

             tres neffs -- tito neffs 
             trop neffs -- tito neffs -- too neffs (not used often) 
             neffs dans la realite -- neffs on the rael 
             neffs 

             "ike", by the way, is now archaic.  if used, you will be looked at like 
             you are not down/out of loop/lame/honkey.

Ok, Ive had mixed responses on whether or not the greyhound station is in the 'hood
or not = p...I will not be alone, but I cant get there until 10:30pm or so, however
I dont intend to leave the station until my ride arrives.
Is anyone (Teknova??) able to tell me where exactly the venue is? It would help in
arranging my ride and  if I would need a taxi. I've heard its at the Trilogy, is
that certain?
Thanks again, Im very greatful
Plur...

My friend went up to Cleveland with his girl and they went by bus.. when he got
back he said everything was fine.. The bus station was fine.. The neighborhood was
fine.. the only complaint he had was they needed to take cabs everywhere and they
got to be a bit expensive..

i think thats what its called, but im referring to the new techno night
opposite scj.

saw david chung there, other that that it seemed to be mainly djs and
their crews.....i knew lots of people there, and there were many nice
lookin women in attendance. i had fun, got to hear some trance (trance
is "crap" according to the instigator, who was well intoxicated) and
some of the instigator's set. he was spinning electro, and was asking me
why i didnt bring my girlfriend with me.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Ive started hacking my pages.
But first off. Anybody else going to believe? Did I miss the
discussion of a netmeet or has no one started one?
If no one has started one I put up my trial pages for netmeet
registration online instead of having to manually manage them. Its
lame and cheezy right now but its a start.  Tell me what you think.
Links are below

http://members.tripod.com/dschwanke is the home for my homepage.
http://members.tripod.com/raves.htm is for my rave resources (has a
pb-cle specific sub section, expect a members section in the future
when I change servers).
http://members.tripod.com/future.htm is for my future parties page.
http://members.tripod.com/believe.htm is specifically for believe.


You can use the form on the future parties page to add any parties you
want. I'll have to add the page manually myself but I get a copy of
the submission in my email when its sent.  Ill only do parties that
are relevent to pb-cle (doesnt nesicarilly mean only pb-cle parties,
we do sometimes travel out of town in groups)

You can use the form on the believe page to add yourself to my niffy
online netmeet list.

Please check them out and tell me what you think, all of the pages are
reachable from the other pages.  (surf around a little bit and youll
get the idea)

Like I said, crosstrainers and the like 
CAN NOT be beat.  Here's why:
 lightweight
 GREAT support
 look cool
 so damn tough and durable
 perfect for everything
 don't squeek when you dance
 good traction

Most ravers wear em, but for good reason!
There are many varieties and brands, so find 
some that suit your tastes.

I think that it's definitely (in theory anyway) an efficient way of doing the
net meet lists, but to be perfectly honest with you, when we do the net meets
manually and little by little, posting them every couple days, it gets me
EXCITED about the party, more and more each time!! So in other words, it
serves as a hype for the party, getting more people involved that would be
otherwise, because they see that more and more people are going to be getting
together, and maybe they'll go because of that! 
Just my 2K...;-)

I heard that believe is being held a couple of blocks over from Dawn, so I
guess it's in the strip district again. I was wondering if anyone was going,
because I'm planning on going. I went to Dawn kind of at the last minute and I
didn't have a watch, so I didn't make it to any of the net meets. Are there
going to be any for Believe? Keep me posted. Also, I wanted to say hi to the 2
list people that I did meet at Dawn.

I don't know if you're familiar with Cleveland, but the bus stop is on
Chester Avenue between E. 13th and E. 15th streets, on the eastern edge of
downtown.  It's really not the ghetto at all.  There are some weird
characters hanging around there, but that's the same at every Greyhound
station...

ive found "trail running" shoes to be the best. they generally have big
soles so you dont slip around, lots of padding, and good support for
running over sticks and stones. i have a pair of new balance trail
running shoes right now that kick ass. before, i had the adidas ones.
they were nice, and lasted a long time. the other advantage: theyre
generally NOT white, so they dont look so ghetto when theyre all beat
up. the adidas were grey, the new balance are brown.

Can anyone tell me what genre this song falls under?

I came across an mp3 of it on the net and I can't seem to listen to
it enough.

Any recommendations of similar material?

hey! shoes that fall apart are "gay"? i take great offense to the use
of that word in such a context. of course you have all freedom of
speech, you can say anything you want, i'm just pointing out how
malicious it sounds, in case you can't tell. my little brother + his
friends say that shit all the time + call each other "queer" and "fag"
when they get mad at each other. it pisses me off, not to mention it
sounds completely infantile.

anyway on the subject of SHOES, yes, cross-trainers are really cool. i
don't wear them anymore though since i need hi-tops even for everyday
use (in addition to an ankle brace) because of the bad condition my
ankles are in and i couldn't find any hi-top cross-trainers. but i
found old-school style adidas hi-tops, which aren't quite as light and
soft, but far more stylee. they are navy blue with white stripes.
probably the rarest shoes i know of, since nobody has either
old-school hi-tops or navy blue low-tops. i got them at some shoe
store in the sandusky mall (it was like a foot locker but a different
co.). my lawyer told me not to go back to sandusky (i can't say why),
and i've never seen them at any other store. so when they wear out, i
hope i can get new ones. i think i need to e-mail adidas.

from the tuesday cleveland plain dealer (look, it mentions ravers!):
 
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
It's 'Teletubbies: The Album' now
 
By John Petkovic
Plain Dealer Reporter

   They speak in strange tongues, hard to decipher. Their antennae
glow when their stomachs transmit strange, repetitious signals.
They're fuzzy, freaky, and cute, the latest British export to colonize
the hearts and minds of 1-year-olds and ravers the world over. And now
they want to sing.
   So long Spice Girls--it's "Time for Teletubbies!"
   Today, Dipsy, Laa-Laa, Po and Tinky Winky, the baby- faced aliens
with TV sets in their tummies collectively known as the Teletubbies,
make their musical debut with "Teletubbies: The Album." The record
features music and remixes from the half-hour "Teletubbies" TV series
which airs daily at 8:30 and 11:30 a.m. on WVIZ Channel 25 and at 6:30
and 9:30 a.m. on WEAO Channel 49. The album includes the group's No. 1
British hit, "Teletubbies Say 'Eh-Oh.'"
   The show features the happy Tubsters frolicking over the magical
green hills of Teletubbyland, where they eat "tubbycustard" and
"tubbytoast," chatter in Tubbyspeak, and at the end of every episode,
join for a "Biiii-ig Hug." But "Teletubbies" isn't just kids' fare.
The techno-babies have become a cult fave among the trippy rave set
and Tinky Winky, a male Tubby who carries a red patent-leather purse
became a hit with transvestites.
   The album is just as freaky and fun. Surreal ditties like "Puddle
Dance," "Dipsy's Fancy Hat," and "Jumping for Fun" cleverly mix
oom-pah beats, bouncy melodies, carnival-tunes, and eclectic
orchestration (bassoons, oboes, and banjos, mixed with synthesizers
and sing-songy rhymes) to avoid pop cliche. Tikes and hipsters alike
will go gaga over this trip through Teletubbyland. I sure did.
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
i wonder who did those remixes, and if they're happy hardcore. ;)

I've been deleting all the posts about signal cause I thought it was
some other party, but it all just clicked and I realized what it was
and that I have a flyer for it and talked to the guy throwing it.

The deal is: One of the guys throwing it is the guy that ALWAYS (I've
only seen him without it once) wears a "Nutty Junglist" shirt.  It's
green and on the back there is a street sign looking thing that has a
black outline of a guy with dreads dancing and undernieth it is says
"Junglist" or something like that.  Anyways, he's a cool guy . . .
he's always dancing and just helps create a great vibe.  He said that
it is just a small party that him and his friends are putting
together.  Nothing more than that.

i can't believe you missed the obvious metaphor.  dramatic irony in full
effect.  i am gay.  but i wasn't even using that definition of gay.  i
was using the *other* definition (the one that is not even defined yet). 
i don't think it is autodestructive behavior either, so chill out. ;)

hey,  i was wondering if anyone knew of any rather large 3 room venues.. with
the main room having about a 1500 person capacity, and the other 2 rooms
having capacity for 600 or 700 each.  i would prefer it to be as near as
possible to either cleveland or columbus.  oh, and i would need it in late
april or may of next year.

any help would be greatly appreciated.

Since no one's done this yet . . .

Let's plan a net meet for this one!  Since it's officially known that it's
at Trilogy, I say we shoot for a relatively quiet (ya, right) and well lit
place.  Let's say directly outside the bathrooms in the main room at 2:00.

Can someone bring that great pb-cle-raves sign?  Matt?

i was at On as well, and i must say that i had a fucking fantastic time,
aside from the nasty cough that i had to deal with.  B dee once again
managed to destroy my ability to connect to the physical world.  His sets
get better and better everytime i hear him.  Instagator was good...when i
was leaving...i really didn't like the first half hour or so, but he
finally threw down some hard ass shit, and put a smile on my face (which
he prolly wouldn't be too happy to hear =))  All the same, ya'll gotta
turn out for this...the kidz who put it together are friends of mine and
their hearts are in the right place.  Come out and support it...it's worth
your money.

Net-Meet: 3AM to the right of the main stage and 6AM outside the boys
bathroom. Let's try this. If it's a big problem for anybody, let me know
and we'll change it around a bit. I know alot of people have been
missing the net-meets cuzz of the crazy lines lately, so let's try that
6AM net-meet.

jbrick and I stopped in at "On" as well. We didn't stay long because we're
sick :(, but I *really* liked the vibe while B dee was spinning.
Steelcityjungle is kewl, but this was a lot more fun.

Speaking of trance and Laga, please consider checking out two elektro bands
there this Friday.

Spahn Ranch are a classic industrial band from L.A. who have become more
and more techno over the past few years. Their instrumentation is 100%
electronic -- their on stage line up is vocals, keyboards, and drum pads.
They have some sound samples at:
http://www.hallucinet.com/cleopatra/spahn_ranch/sounds.html

Apoptygma Berzerk are from Norway. This is their first U.S. tour. They
play Electronic Body Music -- a hybrid of techno and industrial. They are
sometimes called gothic techno for their slightly mournful vocals, but the
music is basically trance. Their song "Love Never Dies, Part One" samples
Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana" just as Apotheosis did in their classic rave
track, "O Fortuna." There are sound samples of them at
http://www.berzerk.regio.net/apoptygma/sounds.html

The show will end by 10pm, leaving plenty of time for you to hit
Believe. If you don't want to go to Believe right away, you might want to
stick around for the weekly club night Ceremony, which lasts until 2:20 am.
Guest DJ BENT! from New York City will be spinning mostly Electronic Body
Music (EBM), and his non-stop beatz are sure to keep raver feet happy.

Visuals for the whole night will be provided by Type-O, who will be
drawing on imagery from dark fairytales like The Dark Crystal and
Labyrinth for this event.

So that's Spahn Ranch and Apoptygma Berzerk, this Friday at Club Laga in
Pittsburgh, 7pm, all ages, $10 advance/$12 at the door.
Hope to see some of you there! If you're at all interested in any darker
and different takes on techno, you won't be disappointed.

hi kids.  can anyone tell me what's on the right side of locust lane in state
college, pa (coming from 322 or 26s)?  venue is so important to me.

this party looks suspiciously good to me.  cute little flyer that doesn't try
so damn hard to be down, announced venue, two rooms, low cost.

altho i don't know anything about 16e productions, i suspect they're just some
college kids.  

love,
david

im sorry frankie. a gay-bo is something different all together.
there are 3 things that classify someone as a gay-bo.

1. wearing socks with sandals.

2. wearing overalls with no shirt underneath.

3. wearing a shirt for the band you are seeing in concert that was not
purchased at that concert. (ie, going to see the counting crows while
wearing a counting crows shirt you bought at nrm)

so there./

i was dissappointed when i saw labryinth for the first time since i was a
little kid. ive heard that dark crystal stands up to maturing better. whats the
dilly? i wanna go out and rent it, i remember it being such a beautiful film.
also good was dragonslayer, which i saw atgain recently and was still
excellent.

watched "shaolin executioners" tonight. it contains the "tigerstyle" sample
from "wu tang clan aint nothin to fuck with". it was kind of confusing at
first, but it ended up being a pretty good film.

also, i must recommend "dead man on campus". its hilarious.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

Sat Nov 28                        ENERGIZE                               DC

U L T R A W O R L D 
in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year history.
It is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for it to do to
the dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond.  It will be held in
the massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in this space
before, none will compare to the excellence of Energize.

The main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one
wide-open, high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set
Energize apart from our previous events is that we have now been approved
to use the basement! Don't think basement like dark and dingy though,
this basement has ceilings of 40', and makes the biggest dance clubs on
the East Coast look like efficiency apartments in Manhattan.  Plus it's
divided up into rooms of various sizes. 
For the first time at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all
with full on concert level production in both sound and lighting.  

All performers listed below are confirmed.  The four rooms of Energize
will
be:

The Main Arena:   We will fill this space with the best sound system we
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of lasers,
projection screens and intelligent lights.  The lineup is one of the best
we have ever presented, a true blend of the most prevalent styles of
electronic dance music.  From hard techno, to trance, to funky breaks, to
fun party music, the main room at Energize is going to be all that and
more.  The performers are:

CARL CRAIG performing live as
Paperclip People  Planet E Records, Detroit
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI  Matsuri Productions  London/Tokyo
DOC MARTIN  Los Angeles
ICEY  Zone, Orlando
SCOTT HENRY  Buzz, DC
T1000  Generator/DJax, Detroit
NIGEL RICHARDS  611 Records, Philadelphia

You may have seen that Uberzone was previously listed in the main room.
They
had said they were available, but then decided to cancel all bookings for
the
rest of the year to make time to write new music. 

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena:  In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the
undisputed
champions of the U.K. scene.  This area will be hosted by 2 Tuff
productions
of DC.  The lineup is:

GROOVERIDER  Sony, Prototype, U.K.
FABIO  U.K.
MC GQ  the U.K.'s premier MC
DARA  Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY  Platinum, Philadelphia
AK1200  Orlando
DB  Breakbeat Science, NYC
SLANT  2 Tuff, DC
ENTITY  Ultraworld
FLUID  Sonic Soul, Baltimore
MC DUB2  Philadelphia

The Deep House Arena:  This third area, also in the basement, is bigger
then any dance club on the East Coast.  It will be hosted by
Philadelphia's Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long.  The performers are:

DERRICK CARTER  Chicago
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION  Universal Language, U.K.
FEELGOOD  Charm City Records, Baltimore
KENNY GLASGOW  Toronto
O'KEEFE  Circle, Philly
ROB PAINE  Circle, Philly
SEAN THOMAS  Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena:  The smallest area of the event, but still bigger
then the main room at most clubs!  This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
respected Sonic Soul crew, and will feature the downtempo side of
electronic music.  You can dance if you want to, with performers:

TIM "LOVE" LEE  Tummy Touch, U.K.
PETE LAWRENCE  the Big Chill, U.K.
WE performing live  Asphodel, NYC
LOVEGROVE  Sonic Soul
DJ C  Toneburst, Boston
RHOMBUS  Sonic Soul

What makes this event even more exciting, is the fact that it will be a
collaborative effort between Ultraworld, Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.
While Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction for
the event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically manage
the areas of music they are most interested in.  What that means for you
is that you get the highest quality of production and care going into
every aspect of the event.

Tickets will be on sale in the DC/Baltimore area on September 30, and
should be at all of the outlets by October 3, and will be broken down as
follows:

There will be 1000 tickets sold for only $20!   So if you know you're
going to go, you have the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low
price.  We are accepting orders for these tickets now, or you can wait
until they are at the outlets. If you'd like to mail order your ticket,
send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER ONLY, made out to Ultraworld Productions for $20
per ticket ordered.  Send it to:

Ultraworld Productions
3042 O'Donnell St
Baltimore, MD  21224

After those 1000 are gone the price will be $25 up to and including
October 31.  

On November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that
price even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets.  Admission at the
gate will be $35.

Also, we are working with the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend.
For those of you who may not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held
every Friday by DJ's Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt.  It plays host to
the world's top DJ's and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of
the best in the country.  When you purchase your ticket to Energize, there
will be a stub which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for
only $5  (Note: Tickets purchased through Ticketmaster will not have this
stub, but Buzz will honor the $5 admission).   Consider coming to DC on
Friday, and making a long stay of it.  We'll post hotel and travel info on
this site in the weeks to come. 

To stay in DC, try these hotels:
Phoenix Park Hotel (closest to venue)	202.638.6900
Best Western (closest to Buzz & afterparty)	202.488.7500
Holiday Inn				202.383.3838
Wyndham Bristol				202.995.6400

Rates are around $90 per night.


When you've had your turkey and you're done with the family, 
the place to be is Washington, D.C. for Ultraworld's ENERGIZE!!!

Are there pages that:

Have the collection of promotors and their infolines for the pb-cle
area?

Have the contact information for DJs that are regular to the pb-cle
area (that want their information public obviosly :))

DJ 'whos who' page. (w/pics, styles of music, etc)

With the number of people with easy access to the web on a regular
basis I figure these would be some fairly usefull things to have.
Specailly the dj/promoter pages if you need to get in contact with
someone at the last minute and you have a wireless network connection
<grin>.

Someone could cut and paste the list to the list every couple days.
Soon as I figure out javascript I could setup an option to have it
auto mail the list each time a new person is added to the website or
every x days or something.

     um, sorry i didn't reply to this sooner, 
     i've been a little delinquent about my email
     recently. i'm going to be completely honest here
     and try and tell things exactly as they are
     (as far as i can see them anyway)... so here
     goes:

     the info-line goofup was a result of tim being
     booked through someone from ohio. it's a stupid 
     mistake we intend to rectify. 

     the charity event is something that has caused 
     enough grief already, and doesn't even bear discussion
     anymore. tim is -not- to blame for his involvment,
     if anything, i am. who can blame me for wanting to
     hear a nice trance set, dammit? the fact that i _didn't_
     get to hear him spin is doubly annoying. payment is
     something we still fully intend to take care of.

     <sigh>

     it _is_ unacceptable, and i'm _not_ pleased, believe
     me. i mean, as far i'm concerned, the pittburgh scene
     is my scene and i don't want someone taking it lightly,
     least of all someone who doesn't understand it... 

     we just care enough to want to fix the mistakes, rather
     than ignoring them. the rave scene is about education and
     acceptance, not exclusivity. we have something beautiful,
     and seeing it being belittled or exploited is painful.

     actually, he called fame records for DJ bookings, is all.
     there was never supposed to be involvement beyond that
     point. however, the fact seems to be that he is set on
     throwing the party come what may - and seeing that he has
     a really nice venue, and reasonable (if misguided) 
     organizational skills, there's no reason not to turn this
     to our advantage. as we see it, the scene could do with a
     nice clean new venue, and we have a chance to either take
     from it what we can, and turn something misguided and greedy 
     into something that gives _back_ to the scene even without
     meaning to.

     i have to admit that i was very skeptical when i first
     heard of this party - at the time it seemed more of a sad
     joke than something i'd pay any attention to. i was angry
     with jenn for wasting time and energy (no matter how little)
     on what for all intents and purposes appeared to me to
     be another daren (note: see list archives for NGL's sordid
     saga), and i simply was _not_ having anything to do with it.
     no amount of money is worth the kind of grief that 
     misguided greed can cause.

     the scene doesn't need any more outside disrespect. we aren't
     simply a revenue stream that's there for the taking. there
     are no faceless numbers at a rave, and i'd rather have
     someone who is part of the scene doing _anything_ than some
     outsider who has absolutely no comprehension of what a rave
     really means trying to treat us like pop culture.

     it was either diss it, or take control. for my money this 
     is the better option.

     i dunno, it's far from being all peachy at this point, for
     sure. what we are trying for now is to pretty much take the
     space out of the owners hands and use it for something
     worthwhile. it's taken time and a bunch of effort to get
     where it is now, and we're simply working away at gaining
     control over something we think should be rightfully ours
     _anyway_.

     we aren't about supporting someone whom we think will be
     detrimental to the scene. fuck that. if we didn't think
     that the party was worth salvaging we wouldn't be wasting
     our time. we have plenty of better things to do than get
     involved in another selfish venture that's going to end
     up hurting those involved, and hurting the scene. if i
     was interested in money i'd be doing consulting work for
     $20 an hour, not trying in some vague and misguided manner
     to provide an environment for others to have a good time.

     truly, i wish everything was as pretty as the flyer. i
     also wish that you could buy x at rite-aid, and that
     i had my own venue and a nice cash flow so that we
     could have parties however the hell we wanted. but it's
     not so. i learned that life was hard around the third
     nervous breakdown. i'm not about to give up now.

     we're doing this with the best intentions. i'm not
     sure what else there is to say...

      it's straight up disrespectful, IMO. i can only
      speak for the way he's treated me, and the fact that
      pissing off people in the local scene is a great
      way to sink a party is something he doesn't seem
      to grasp. it's stupid really. what's even more 
      stupid is that it's totally pointless and uneccessary,
      and i think it would just get worse before it gets
      better. as far as i'm concerned, the less anybody has
      to deal w. him the better.

Since no one's done this yet . . .

Let's plan a net meet for this one!  Since it's officially known that it's
at Trilogy, I say we shoot for a relatively quiet (ya, right) and well lit
place.  Let's say directly outside the bathrooms in the main room at 2:00.

Can someone bring that great pb-cle-raves sign?  Matt?

I guess I will start te list thingy...unless Matt(ratfink) you want to do it.
Get you names in.

This is who I have so far...

wait 'till i fall asleep to pull this shit out.

i can reproduce, i just don't feel the need (because if my genes got
out...;P). i have a bigger thyroid gland than you, i can metabolize lipids
faster (that's obvious), and that's why your dog got shot in 1986.

Yep.  I had a Technics 1600 laying around, 
so I thought, "Hey, I should hook that up too!"
So I did.  Spinning on 3 turntables is pretty 
tough!  I don't think I have enough records to
do it for long though...
I did successfully match 3 Chi House records
for a long time though...
And other house.
I assume it would be easier with another 1200 MK2.

I know a lot of list members are computer geniuses, so I wanted to ask you
first.  I've been using PINE as a mail program for all of my computer
life. I love it!  But now that I have to add another mail box to my dial
up account, I've been told that I need to use a mail program that allows
me to download email to my hard drive (I hope I explained this correctly).  
Some POP stuff, hell, I don't know.

The options I was given are: Eudora Lite, Pegasus and Outlook Express.

I want the one that is most similar to PINE that will allow me to read in
files, easily make address books (ie the "take" function) and do elist
mailings with bcc or lcc (preferably lcc).  I'm also interested in ease of
use.

So, which would you recommend?

Braden

{global clattering of subscribers, unsubscrbing.  majordomo is now broken,
we are the only ones left..you asshole}

I have something valid to say.  Like one month ago when I had the change
to see BBBIL and DICKhumptyVisson...I now have the chance to experience
WORLD RENOUNED "Dj Icey" for free.  What does he spin?  Should I go?  The
kids here are like:  "yeah, he *spins*" (as though it were the only
qualifier for a good time)...so i am once again asking the technosage
pb-cle for advice/comments/recosuggestions?

I know there are a lot of good parties this weekend, but I am going to one
in Toronto on Sat. called the Emerald City with Bad Boy Bill and Richard
"Humpty" Vision headlining, playing solo and together on 4 tables, 2
mixers, plus a lot of other dj's in three rooms...blah blah blah...Anyway,
if anyone else is going, I have a place in Bemus Point, NY which is pretty
much the halfway point to Toronto from both Pgh and Cleveland, with beds, a
shower, kitchen, etc. that people could crash at/hang out at before or
after the party.  So if anyone is going and is interested, the offer is
there; just let me know.  plur, dan

This isn't rave-related,but since we all use computers,i thought you'd 
get a kick out of it:

Y2K solution

Corporate has determined that there is no longer any need for network or 
software applicatins support. (see below)

The goal is to remove all computers from the desktop by Jan, 1999. 
Instead, everyone will be provided with an Etch-A-Sketch. There are many 
sound reasons for doing this:

1. No Y2K problems
2. No technical glitches keeping work from being done.
3. No more wasted time reading and writing emails.

Thank you

FAQ for Etch-A-Sketch Techincal Support:

Q. My Etch-A-Sketch has all of thses funny little lines all over the 
screen
A. Pick it up and shake it

Q. How do I turn my Etch-A-Sketch off?
A. Pick it up and shake it

Q. What's the short cut for undo?
A. Pick it up and shake it

Q. How do I create a New DOcument window?
A. Pick it up and shake it

Q. How do I set the background and foreground to the same color?
A. Pick it up and shake it


Q. What is the proper procedure for rebooting my Etch-A-sketch?
A. Pick it up and shake it

Q. How do I delete a document on my Etch-A-Sketch?
A. Pick it up and shake it

Q. How do I save my Etch-A-Sketch document?

Wow, that's pretty tasteless.  I've admitted before to not paying
attention all of the time.  Did I miss something about a contest of
who can gross out and insult the collective list the most with one post?
Would it be possible to TRY and stay on topic.  Please, restrain
yourselves.  Not all of us care about sex-related forwards.  There are
specific lists for that, I'm sure.

the easiest way to get to state college (are you going from
cleveland?) is to just take I-80W to PA, then get onto 22W, then 220N.
Take 220 North to 322 into State College (there will be an exit on your
right, you'll pass a bunch of small towns, namely Tyrone and Bald Eagle).  
322 turns into South Atherton St.  It runs along the side of State
College.  Stay on Atherton for a little while.  You'll pass Giant Eagle
grocery store on your right, keep going, Kinkos on your left.  Then you
need to turn left onto Beaver Avenu.  This is one way.  There will be a
lot of stop and go, since this runs through the center of State College.
Pass the public library on the right.  you'll come to an interesection
where there is a big church on your right, a movie theatre behind you on a
left, and a public parking lot also on your left.  turn left at this
intersection.  Locust lane is this small little alley right after the
parking lot.  turn left into the alley, and take it one block past the
movie theatre.  there's not much parking, better off parking in the pay
lot i previously mentioned.  the Wesley Center is a brick building
connected to a big stone church called St. Paul's United Methodist Church.
shitty place for a party, real small, and connected to a church at that.
but i still recommend going. this is really the first party i've seen in
state college, so it's pretty cool that they're trying to get a scene
going.

hope this helps you.  sorry about the lack off street names once again.
it's been awhile.  if i got anything wrong, i post the corrections.

Ive started a pb-cle-raves webring and made myself the administrator.

For those of you who are unfamiliar a webring is a way of grouping
sites of similar topics together. Each page has an htmlfragment at the
bottom of the page stating its part of the ring and has links to the
next 5 sites the past 5 sites all the sites and a random site as well
as the homepage of the webring. 

Here is the link to the webring homepage:
http://members.tripod.com/dschwanke/webring.htm

Please check it out and add your sites, ill stick them in soon as they
test out ok.  If you need any advice or help on doing the page bits
tell me and dont be afraid to ask. I tried to make the home page
comprehensive. ANY and ALL comments and critisms are welcome.

I think this is a very good thing, we have a lot of individual pages
sitting around so it would be cool to be able to have them linked
together as well as invite others to join us. I would like for this to
be just the pb-cle-raves ring there I think is already a more global
raves ring but I havnt looked closely at/for it yet.

Ill give you guys a little while to read this and do it on your own
then Im gunna email some specific people who's sites I would like to
definitly see listed.

I think this beats the hell out of everyone managing their own 'links'
page.

I had originally decided not to go to Creation2, but due to peer-pressure =p, I am now
going.
Some very nice people offered rides from the greyhound bus station (on chester ave,
about 5 min from the venue), and although I do realize its short notice, I was
wondering if any offers still stand. I will be arriving at around 10:30pm so if this
is convenient for anyone, please email me by 6pm. Thanks to all who have emailed me w/
advice, i cant wait to meet everyone!
plur,
Brooke

I found this article about Navigate in "The Other" (a free columbus
entertainment paper.)  I thought some of you would get a kick out of it (plus
an explanation....)

"A Rave at.....Otterbein?"

	"You can bet the next time students sugggest a newfangled, youth-oriented
event at Otterbein College, administrators will ask a few more questions.  A
crowd of 1000-1500 people attended 'Navigate', a rave held from 12-6a.m.
Sunday in the school's Rike Athletic Center.  Many attending were not
Otterbein students, and police arrested five people, mostly for drug related
offense.
	For the uninitiated -- which, until recently included numerous Otterbein
officials -- raves are huge noisy, all-night dance parties.  And one other
thing: Some raves tend to ingest chemicals.  Officials at the Methodist-
affiliated cmpus-located in dry Westerville -- were not happy with the size of
the crowd, the number of non-students attending, or the presence of alcohol
and drugs.  'I think we got into an activity we didn't fully understand, '
Gatti said.  'I don't think that most of the institution knew what a rave was
or that a rave would be held until Thursday.'
	.....since college officials don't have to approve...the rave was below the
school's radar --until last thursday when Otterbein's student
newspaper...published an article about it.  At that point, Gatti said, he
considered nixing the event.....But Gatti decided to press ahead, attending
the rave with other college officials and bringing in two Otterbein security
officers.
	Collective Intelligence also provided 50 or 60 security people who searched
students at the door, Gatti said.  A recording on the promoter's information
line warned that no drugs, alcohol or bottles were allowed in the building.
	Seven Westerville police officers alwo were present, 3 on special duty for
Collective Intelligence.  Police Sgt. Al Kolp said officers arrested 5 people,
mostly on possession charges, and confiscated crystal methamphetamine,
marijuana, some still-unidentified pills, and drug paraphernalia, including
pipes.
	Most people at the rave behaved well, Gatti said, although, 'We still had
drugs in the building, and we don't want that.'  He said ravers as old as 40
showed up, from as far away as Chicago.
	Gatti said he's not angry with the student organization which planned the
rave, but in the future he does plan to oversee events involving non-students.
'Certainly, we're going to look at some things,' he said.

well, hope you enjoyed that perspective...

oh yeah, hope to see ya'll at basement.... :)

Well, i just got back fome believe and it was...interesting...I did have a wonderful time though.
At first i was a little worried, cuz it was small, and dark, and seemed kinda shady, but once i started dancing it was all good!
I only got to see 3 dj's. Tim Zelch:Sounded very nice, but i just coudn't get in to the trancy type of thing tonite.
Dustin rocked! I havn't heard him spin for a while and it was nice to hear, cuz it got me dancing a little!
Desiel Boy KICKED ASS! I'm not a huge jungle fan either(okay, im a house head, allright!) but his set rocked!

All in all i had a really good time..
hello to andy the brew, josh k'osh b'gosh, tom cox, stephan(Sp?), trout, jade, andy the pooh, don, kelly and everyone else i met and may have forgotton!
love to all!

deiselboy was pretty hard.. and not to be a bitch but in my opinion ..
the party was pretty bad.. the lineup was great.. but no matter how great
the lineup is.. if you cant dance then what difference dose it make? Its
was my first time at that venue.. and it was small and the place was
packed.. plus my one friend had all of his drugs taken off of him.. he
said he would leave with the stuff and not come back but the people at
the door where shady and kept it.. plus it looked to me that there where
tons of narqs.. it was just a bad vibe.. I dont endorse drug use.. but
please... ravers are the only real "buyers" anymore.. raves are full of
drugs..  things allot worse then pot. I thought the funniest part was
when I walked into the rave and 4 people came up to me asking if I wanted
cris. and then when I was talking to my friend mad heads where smoking up
.. but yet my friend lost his stuff.. over all the party was ok.. but not
for 15$..

and have prolly met a lot of you before w/o even knowing it.... I WILL be
at CONTINUUM nov. 27th and was jsut trying to see how many other kids on

Man, that party was awesome.  Before I say anything else I just want
to scream DIESELBOY!!!  I havent heard such a good jungle set for a
long, long time. 

OK, now that I've got that out my system, here goes the rest of the
review:
Venue: When I first came in I was nervous.  It seemed like it was too
small to house the crowd that I knew would be coming to see such big
acts.  But, though little venues can be bad because of lack of room,
the vibe in them is usually better.  So I figured I'd just have to
wait and see how it turned out.  Oh yeah, I also liked the fact that
there were speakers in all the corners.  That was quality.
Music: I enjoyed every dj that played.  Like I said before tho,
DIESELBOY!!!
Vibe:  I'm gonna have to give it five stars.  It was unbelievable. 
Everyone had a huge smile on their faces and many, many people were
gettin down.  I think that the fact that the venue was small did in
fact contribute to this.  As for the complaints about it being to
crowded, well I guess it was for about a two hour period mostly
spanning Dieselboy's set.  It was kinda hard to dance, but before and
after that, it wasnt all that bad.  
Shout outs: to all the list members I saw up there.  I met two list
members, Meredith and David Schwanke, and I saw a whole lot of others;
Andy the Pooh, Patti, Andy the Brew, Tom, John, Jade, Trout, Steffan,
and I think that was it, but if I'm forgetting someone, sorry.

Anyway, I had a blast and I hope everyone else did too.
Peace
Josh

I forgot to say one thing in my review.  When I was leaving, I went to
get my sweatshirt, and I just could not find it.  That really sucked
because I love that shirt.  It is a grey addidas hoody. If anyone
found it during the clean up, or if someone picked it up by mistake
please email me.
Thanx
Josh

Hey everyone..

As some of you may have heard, the original venue that we intended for
Continuum was to be Trilogy (in the Flats).  As some of you also may have
heard, last Sunday, U4ia was raided by police who locked down the club and
searched the entire place, including everyone in attendance.  This occurance
has caused the owners of Trilogy to demand that every single person that walks
through the front doors of Trilogy to be of 18 years of age with a valid id.  

Being the only 2 room venue in Cleveland to my knowledge, we tried desperately
to do everything we could to make the venue legal for all ages, including
offering to pay an extra $1500 to buy out the bar in the main room and to only
have alcohol served in the back, red room.  We offered to purchase our own
insurance policy for the evening, and we also offered to only let people under
the age of 18 in before midnight (thus eliminating any possibility of curfew
laws taking effect).  Well, we seemed to think that everything would be okay,
but the owners of Trilogy didn't want to take the risk (?) of trying to make
their club legal for everyone for one night.  They also are stead-fast against
people bringing in any bookbags or backpacks.

So, after about a day and a half of contemplation, we decided that in order to
not have to turn away whoever showed up without I.D. or those who aren't yet
18, we decided that we would have to ONCE AGAIN return to the USA Skating
Place.  

We apologize to those of you that are sick of this venue, but being on the
very young side ourselves (our last member of shortarm just turned 18 over the
summer), we feel that this last minute venue change is for the most part,
better for everyone.  For those of you that were at Liquid, there were a bunch
of neighborhood thugs fucking with people and robbing them.  We have already
spoken with the owners of the Skatery, who claim that they no longer come
around there for whatever reason.  We are also going to have additional police
security, in order to prevent any such situation as did arise at Liquid.

We won't be separating the skating floor into 2 stages as we did there at our
first event just over a year ago.. We will instead be having the majority of
our 2nd room acts playing at the free afterhours, which full details will be
posted for by the middle of next week.

If at all possible, I would appreciate it if everyone could spread the word
about the event not being at Trilogy (since it is even listed in scene
magazine as being so).  Also, we hope that everyone that planned on going
still does after all of this.  We really did do this for everyone who comes to
parties on a regular basis (yes, ravers). 
We would have easily made up for the monetary loss of underage "ravers" by the
club crowd that would have wandered into the event without having any idea of
what was going on.

Lou

And a happy hi and hello to the new members i met...
Geoff, frankie g, absolute, and i can't remember the other kids  name...sorry :(

Hope to see you all out and about!!

I'd just like to say (as a person under 18) that I respect the enitre
Shortarm crew very much for making this decision.  Most people would
have said, "screw them." as many promoters do now.  Really this is an
amazing thing, and truely shows the great intentions of Shortarm.

Big up.

Thanks, me three Mr. Rab.  i had a good time, wish i could've stayed
longer.  I was happy w/ our set . . . took a couple minutes to get
into the groove, but once we figured the mixers out etc it was all good.

It's too bad we never found any whip cream though . . .

later,

Hi, I need some help! A friend of mine who owns a record label needs blank cds. He is looking for 1.3 Million (no joke) blank cd-r's for roughly .40-.50 cents a each. I was just wondering if anyone of you have any good connections with distributors or whatever...PLEASE HELP!! 

He had a deal with someone, but now they can't get the cds for him, so i'm trying to help him out.

<shameless website plug>

I also finished updating my homepage. It has all of my tracks in real audio and other stuff, if you wanna swap links let me know! http://www.isni.net/~busch/

as far as the venue being small...thats the way we want it. we'd rather 
have a venue that reaches capacity than have a huge space that is half 
empty. as far as your freind goes...i believe that i recall the 
instance...he had a tupperware container full of pot, right? well if you 
came to the door with a container of dime bags in your backpack, they 
will be found and destroyed. we did not keep the drugs.they were 
disposed of,thank you.if it were up to us we would confiscate and 
dispose of all drugs. however some people are more clever in concealing 
contraband. we are not the gestapo. im sorry that you did not have the 
best time however i think over all the fact that the music was slamming 
should outweigh any other complaints, after all isn't that what really 
counts.

hi peepz....

this was the second time i was at that venue, and i am convinced i am
not ment to have fun there.  as soon as i heard it was there i was not
gonna go, but since someone paid for me, i decided to go...i got there
pretty early, and was actually surprised that the place looked alot
better since crush.....i was reallly happy to hear that porn kings
song, and diesel was really good....but they should of stopped letting
people in.....not only because it got packed, but also because they
ran out of water....i think its fun when there are alot of people

So, this weekend, I was at Chicago's House of Blues seeing Underworld.

Of course, they were great -- but I was a little let down because they
only played for about 2.5 hours, and I was expecting a four-hour set.  

I think my boy and I made up about half of the entire raver
contingency.  The crowd was mostly a group of 25-35-somethings, and
definitely of the yuppie persuasion (if I must classify by superficial
features).

Anyway, this was a nice break in my month of no parties.  Perhaps I
will be able to start raving again by January ...

 Hi Kids, i want to thank every one that came to the party, especially all the
d.j.s, who took time out to practice before they spun, the music was very
tight, and continuous between d.j.s .  i wished more of you kids could have
come, we have some real talent on the list.  if this is a sample of what would
be heard at the pb-cle party, you are all in for a treat. i hope that every
one that came had a good time, next party i have i will have to give you kids
some broken glow sticks to decorate the dance floor again.   speaking of
which, i am working on another party, it will be called 
Mister Rabs' Neighborhood of make believe, i haven't figured a date yet, but
if you are a d.j. and would like to spin let me know, we can start a new list.
i will try to make your trip to my house worthwhile.  also i am very bad with
names, so could everyone that spun please post with your name, the name you go
by, and your E-mail address, and the type of music that you spin........
tomorrow, tomorrow will start the day tomorrow, with a smile or two, till then
i hope your day is snappy, till then i hope you day is happy...peace [;-]+<

Hey FOLKS

Let me start out this way.....IT rocked!...this being my first party in the
US, i'd have to say, i've never been in a place with so many cool people.
I've been to trilogy before....in fact lots of times......when someone
bumps into you, they look at you like "hey, FUKR...git outta my
way!!!"....average party person response.."Sorry man,....you ok...what's
up???"  That's just the beginning....I got some blue glowsticks, and some
chick asked to borrow them, being cool, i gave them to her, not really
expecting to get them back....she gave them back, with a smile and a
hug...WOW....i was impressed...

WHERE WAS everyone????..i was in front of the bathroom doors at 2am, and
only saw a cool girl from erie....(sorry, i'm bad with names) who was cool
as hell (take a bow) and shim Thanks dude..you're cool...

As for the music.....IT ROCKED....i could NOT stop dancing....there were
lots of people dancing....more than i expected, and no one who was trying
to grind up behind girls or anything like that.....I was expecting to have
to be on something to get into it, but i stayed straight all night and
still had a ball...next time though........

Well, just had to say my piece


Brian

that tall dude with long hair......and nifty ass blue glowsticks....


PS...i WAS suprised that i was not the only one who had european party
experience, i'm bringing my whistle next time!!!!

so, i was driving home from getting soda a few minutes ago
and i hear the "im horny" song followed by "the percolator" or
however you spell it on the radio. i almost never listen to the
radio anymore, especially 92 or anything like that, but i was
just about to pop a cd in and hear "im horny, horny horny 
horny" and was like, whoa.. i know this song.. so like, i think
its sorta sick that songs i really like and that i thought were 
somewhat "underground" are now becoming mainstream..
yuck. its just like the punk scene all over again..

This is nothing unusual. 92.3 plays Club Jams every 
Sunday from 10-12pm for as long as I can remember. 
These songs aren't exactly "underground" either.
Have you ever listened to DJ Cochise's Mix at 6 on 
93.1 ? He plays the Perculator very often. Ravers 
aren't the only people who listen to this music.

well the archives are back online, there will be a few minor cosmetic
changes soon, but its all there....
hotbot no longer catalogues this stuff due to some tags i put in, but i
dont know about any other search engines, so still be careful what you
post.

being our one year anniversary and all, we would like to possibly draw a few
more net heads than we normally would, so if you sign up for the net meet
before friday morning, there will be a copy of the net meet at the door and
you will only have to pay $15 instead of $20.  

happy thanksgiving =P

Rich had a funny line about Get F 3.  When I asked him what it was like he said
"I'd rather have been raped in a port-a-john.  Actually, it was just like being
raped in a port-a-john"

Yep, at Magick when it was getting crowded in the lobby (although people tend
to actually prefer to crowd themselves into lobbies and small rooms for some
reason??? even when there's open space elsewhere) I started telling the
masseuses that they had to crowd together on the floor just like those
standing.  Go home and lay around, pleeeze.

well duh, I think it's pretty obvious why people crowded into the lobby
at magick- everywhere else was sticky with paint!
while that space was pretty cool, I just didn't like the sticky factor
very much. and sawdust did no good for my asthma.
have more big parties in the crane warehouse- it's huge, a warehouse &
not too dirty...
also, I'm pretty sure that the irish center is still available for
parties, (they just jacked up the price of rental) so why don't people
use it again?

Na. This happened at Intergalactic Circus too.  The arena was clean and free of
paint and still people chose to crowd into the lobby.  Makes me wonder what a lot
of people go to parties for.  To smoke and give back rubs, I guess.

RAVES ARE DIRTY PLACES!!!   I really can't understand this primadonna attitude that
some ravers are getting about certain conditions at parties.  Granted, there are a
lot of legit gripes but COME ON!  It's a rave!  R  A  V  E!  By definition they are
in dirty abandoned warehouses with crappy sound and crazy kids who love techno.
Times are changing, I understand.  You've got to realize though, the money you're
paying is pretty much going to the high priced DJs and things like sound and lights
and venue, of course.  The fact that there's running water should thrill you.
Think of where this all came from.  Go to the clubs if you want  to sit on leather
couches.  You can't have it both ways.

> have more big parties in the crane warehouse- it's huge, a warehouse &

If you knew the politics behind this space, you'd feel differently.  I've never
seen a more non-raver-friendly environment in my life.  It sucks because that space
could host an awesome party.

I was worried at first because I can honestly say that the bad times out
weigh the good times at Springfield/Dayton/Cincy parties, but last night I
had a blast!! Everyone seemed pretty happy... It was one of those "I don't
wanna leave" nights. Everyone that I met and talked to were really cool. The
music, sound and lights were awesome. It was alot of fun dancing w/ a few
people then hugging afterwards. That's my favorite part :-) Met some new
friends...re-united w/ some old friends. All in all it was a good time and
Im glad I decided to go!!!

Wish everyone could have been there...
-Amy

 That cool girl from erie had me! Thanks, brian :-)
well, I made it to my first net meet. Not to many net ravers showed up, though.

And i would like to thank Rob(DiscoMafia) publicly for being one hell of a guy.

thanks for the ride and for allowing re-entry to my friend and I so that we
could solve a problem that would have made the night an extreamly uncomfortable
one for me (no details needed).
That was my first time at Trilogy, I personally think its great space, although
there could have been less clueless bar-people, but maybe they had their own
fun ;o)
Although most of the time it was hard to find out who was spinning, I thought
the music was very good...terrance parker and dj funk were great, as were the
others whose names I didnt know. Dancing is my main party activity, and
although it got a little crowded, there were no problems on the floor at all.
Being that there are no "raver" kids at my school, I am introducing some kids
here to the scene. I took three friends who had never been to a party before.
They had a good time, although I think they felt a little out of place at
first. By the end of the night, one of my pals was getting down with his
borrowed glowsticks.
 I took more pictures than at any other party Ive been too...including one of a
girlie that I gave my camera to that did not realize it was backwards when she
snapped the picture ;-)...I hope they turn out good.
Overall, I think teknova put on one good party...some people were dissapointed
about the IDing and no backpacks, but I guess  such precautions are necessary
sometimes.

well, hope to see you all at the next net-meet ;-)
Plur,
Brooke, "the cool erie girl"

THANK YOU FOR VOICING THIS! :)  Ok so maybe the dust in the paintball
arena is a bit much and even millvale is rough but this really is
true. Unfortunately we are not in an area where we can throw parties
outside like out west moreso but dirty comes with the party. If you
have seen my torn jean pants then you know what im talking about. I
view raves as the warfare in the urban jungle of society. There will
be causulties and we will get our hands dirty, but we will win.

Two days before Kwantum Beets, Smalls is spinning
at the Avenue!  Hooray!
(Thursday)
I get to see Smalls twice in one week!

Oh yeah, no one replied to me when I asked
how big the laminates are.  So how big are they?

I dunno, I can deal with mud and dust, but paint doesn't wash out so
well and the sawdust got into everything (my shoes my socks my
underwear...)
the majority of parties I've gone to have been pretty clean... (even
outdoor parties =)
I went to a massive party in seattle this summer that was held in an
indoor soccer arena which was really nice. has anyone had a party in a
bowling alley? that would be *so* phat.

too bad there's issues with the crane warehouse... care to elaborate? </gossip>

I really like the paint ball place.. I think the best part is the space .. and that
it is cold.. I mean I got my jacket really fucked up from putting it next to a
wall.. but in the end it was worth it..

smoking and backrubs! what else is there?
from an objective POV, lobbies are a bit more conducive to socializing. you
can actually see and hear for one thing, and if people don't go to parties
in part to interact with others then mebbe i'm missing something...

well gosh, i thought a rave was an illegal drug party where teenagers go to
find drugs and have sex.
but honestly, as much as filth detracts from my enjoyment of drugs and sex
at parties, all i really expect is a reasonable attempt to make the venue
more hospitable. and lemme tell ye, running water thrills me to death!
i'd say that the nastiest thing i encounter at parties are smoke machines,
and the way they work themselves into your clothes, lungs and sweat/skin.
that shite is nasty! and ye gotta remember there's a huge difference between
dirt dirt and warehouse/storage dirt...

okay...i had a okay time at believe.  The music was phat, and i really
wanted to dance, but i couldn't find a space far away enough from the
drunk e'd out hoochies and their fratboy wannabe boyfriends.  Sorry Andy,
but as a dj you see the music as the most important thing, but as a
consumer of what you do, we as "ravers" want more then just being able to
hear music.  You don't pay $15 bucks to stand in a dirty warehouse and
listen to someone spin records.  I can do that for free at home.  The
ability to dance and commune with people at a level that reaches far
beyond our usual temporal existence has more to do with it then just some
records.  Don't think this is some tripped out freaks opinion either.  As
i have stated many times, i don't take drugs at parties, and never will,
but their is more to it then music.  Promoters are nothing without people
to show up at their parties.  So having enough room to dance and to do
something i like to call BREATHING is a good thing.  To be honest I did
enjoy myself.  I just wish their would have been a slightly smaller limit
to the amount of people allowed in.  The tagteam was amazing i must say.
Got my ass away from the wall, made me kick some people outta my way, and
i danced until i hit the floor from exaustion.  All in all...worth my time
but not my money.

The Basement:

This party was probably one of the best parties i've been to in a long
time.  I went with Andy the Pooh and Don and must say i was a bit scared
seeing as we left around twelve thirty and i hadn't gotten back from
believe until about ten.  After hanging out at some friends of Andy's we
left for the venue...sat around for awhile, moved some shit, taped up
stuff...and then the party began.  Frankie Bones blew the muthafuckin
place up.  His set was the complete opposite of his set at DAwn.  He just
ripped a sonic hole through that place.  Atomic BAbies were killer and all
of the local talent that was there were unbelievable.  The main room was
all either destructive techno or phat trance.  The second room was a
little weak, but i think that just had to do with the size and the
darkness.   And of course ending the night with a set of ghetto booty
house from ben kenobi was perfect.

All in all a very rewarding weekend...now off to my hometown to recover
from my sinus/ear/lung infections...and hopefully i'll see you all at
Brisk and Quandum Beats...

dammit, paintball doesnt use paint. it uses colored oil, which washes out of almost
everything. i saw the movie "blade" last night. in it vampire ravers at the peak
moment of the party get sprayed with blood. i thought that would be cool (though
unhealthy) to have at a real rave.

Something I noticed in the pittsburgh scene that I really didnt notice anywhere
else is that the pgh scene is very "clicky" (i dont know if I said that right)
but if you dont allot of people going to a rave to socialize is pretty stupid..
I mean Iv met some people at the pittsburgh raves and thats cool .. but there
are allot of shady people who really keep to therer own group and give that..
"oh fuck here's another kid wanting to be a raver" kinda attitude.. and dont get
me wrong like I said I met allot of cool people.. but the vibe i get is really
sort of stand offish..

Iv never found any free sex at a rave.. and if things go the way they did at
believe I dont think you will find any more drugs..

I agree those smoke machines are killers.. My family was killed by smoke
machines.. plus running water is great.. and letting a "safe" number of people
into a venue is great.. but when promoters start packing you in like sardines..

umm. i go to raves to listen to the music. socializing is fun, but i only do it if
the party isnt moving me very much. 1st priority = dance. why else would anyone go
to a rave? if you wanna socialize, go somewhere that costs less money. i think
every stupid rich kid that pays his 15$ to get into a rave and then buys e and sits
on the ground "socializing" should be executed on sight. people are so stupid it
makes me sick. raves are for dancing and having a good time. im gonna start
throwing "social events"( where everyone goes and does massive quantities of drugs
and "socializes" ) at the same time as good raves so all the people i hate wont be
there bothering me.

Well tomorrow I am going home to see my parents for Thanksgiving.
Unfortunately I have only been to Cincinnati about 3 times in the past 2
years and each time the average time spent there was about 4 hours 
(enough time to eat, take a shower and maybe do a load of laundry)and
have lost  touch with pretty much everyone I used to know. I am planning
on going to Gobble on Wed but other than that what is there for me to
do? Am I destined to spend the next week watching reruns of Scooby Doo?
Please help me!!!!

I also get annoyed at the mass amounts of campers at raves.  You know them
you see them, but before instituting gestapo-like measures upon their
naieve masses we should remind ourselves that they aren't on any mailing
list or don't read articles about DJ's etc.

I don't think there is anything wrong chilling during a set or two and many
of the kids are just that, kids (most likley high skoolers) and the worst
thing ya wanna do is inject them with bad vibes without explaining why yinz
are so upset.

If we want to see parties more like they way we enjoy them, perhaps we
should try to bring them into the fold.  Some possibilities are
distributing a little trueskool like paper (oh no, more mess :-) or even
better talking to a few and getting some to dance for awhile.  Its a vibe
that spreads but sometimes can take a little work.  This of course helps if
there is lots of room to dance and sound is pumping throughout the whole
space.

Or maybe you could just install some electric zapping fence around the
perimiter of your next party. Or some yummy chocolate pudding on the floors
;)

pLuR,

jbrick

If the Rave Gods wanted us to socialize so much, then 
why would the music be so DAMN loud???

Well, I guess I'm in the minority here, but Believe was fucking
awsome.  True, running water would be nice, but the packed dance floor
led to a vibe that made me feel like I was rolling before I ate that
Versace.  I only thought that it was too crowded for Dieselboy's
incredible set.  
I met a bunch of great people there, and the best was the five person
hug.  
I really had fun at this party.  Good music, great vibe.

Socks and underwear?  What exactly were you doing @ Magick? ;)

Personally i like dirty ass spaces.  I like to feel all gritty and
sweaty and tired after a rave (ringing ears is bad, but i expect it)  I
know the kids don't want all their nice new gear messed up, but guess
what: fuck em!

As in people who just sit there? Just for the record a lot of the time
I am a camper :) Sometimes I just go and sit for the entire party and
listen to the music and the people around me. Dancing isnt for
everyone. Took me a real long time to get up the courage to dance
(anyone remember back the flamewar about dancing when I first got on
the list? That was cuz I was scared to dance myself :)   

A lot of people wont dance until they think they are good enough to
dance.  I try to get people to dance sometimes, especially if I think
they are on the verge of dancing but need that little extra push.

Actually Im gunna do up some cheap simple flyers or business cards for
pb-cle-raves
people just to give to people who say hi.  I always get one or two
people "hey didnt I see you at such and such.." sounds like a
conversation starter to me :) Why not askem if they are online and
give em our address.

On a side note, there would be much less sitting if there were real
E (MDMA) going around too. It's been nothing but the same sad shit
going around for months.

this is gonna soudn ridiculous but...

me and a few of my crackhead friends went off on a tangent about this
already: with enuff money, you could easily convince one of those
places that does all night cosmic bowling to have a one off
rave-cosmic-bowling... i mean, they blast (crap) music and people
dance, right (i've never been.. that's just what i hear). plus they
have blacklights and everything glows, right? they have large rooms
for private parties. yes... it sounds ludicrous, and i might be alone
in sayin that if someone put it together i'd be the first person to
buy a ticket, but that would kick some serious ass :)

oh yeah... and you'd have to call the event "300" (number of points in
a perfect game) and everyone would have to wear bowling shoes.

That's because you're not on the "free sex list" at the door.  Let me know for the
next party and I'll put you on.  Frankie G always makes sure he's on the "free sex
list".  Ask him for details.

Two summers ago, some friends and I went to glow bowling.  There were lots
of stupid cheerleaders and teenage frat boys there.  There was also a
"dj".  I say that sarcastically because he wasn't jockying discs unless
you count cds.  It was a really crappy mix of music, too (country,
hip-hop, bass-baby, alternative, etc.).  I actually convinced him to play
a 1.8.7. tape and the father of the cheerleaders started grooving out.
Pretty nifty.

Well . . . this has already been done.  I'm not exactly sure where or
when, but I've heard of it done before.  It was more of just a chill
get together (possible future pb-cle party) than an all out rave though.

For the most part, they play a lot of drek.  But the DJs at a few of the
places (Monroeville, I think -- I've no sense of direcion) were cool
enough to play CDs brought up to them.  They were pretty open to some
strange musics, so I don't see why they wouldn't go for it.

Sorry, you can't jam in bowling shoes, you fall all over the place.  Now
tabi boots, on the other hand...

Great, here we go on footgear again...

Here's some more:

(Picture me on a podium with proper hand and body gestures)

We are not the X generation. We are not the Sex generation.
This is not the 60s. This is not the 90s.
This is the new millenium and we are the Rave generation.


Its not as catchy I wish I could remember how it went exactly.
There was another one too, ill see if I can reconstruct it.

Free your mind and the rest will follow.
Rest your mind and freedom will follow.
Follow the rest and your mind will be set free.

Every so often I get these 'feelings' where some really cool saying
comes out of my mouth and I get warm and fuzzy all over.  Happened
with that first one, with Turn on, Tune In, Geek Out and these other
two.  

No, im not full of myself :) No of course not :) Ego? Whats that? :))

that track was mainstream from the get go. records like that are big the week

i honestly was a little scared this weekend when i heard a *big name* dj put

MAN CHARGED WITH SELLING $10 OF POT IN '73 SEEKS ASYLUM

A mortgage company owner from Detroit who has lived crime-free in
Michigan for 24 years is fighting extradition to Virginia on charges
that he sold $10 worth of marijuana there in 1973.

Alfred Martin had thought he was safe in Michigan.

In 1974, he walked away from a prison farm in Martinsville, Va., two
days after starting his 10-year prison sentence, and moved his family
to New York and then Michigan. In 1976, then-Gov. William Milliken
effectively granted him legal asylum in Michigan by refusing to
extradite him to Virginia to face the rest of his sentence and new
escape charges.

But on Wednesday, Martin, 49, was pulled over in Livonia for having
expired plates, and the officer found the old Virginia warrants in the
computer. Since 1976, several court rulings have changed extradition
laws, preventing a governor from blocking an extradition.

Martin spent two nights in jail and appeared in jail greens Friday
before Circuit Judge William Cahalan, alongside confessed heroin
addicts and burglary suspects.

Cahalan released Martin on a $15,000 cash bond pending another hearing
Dec. 7. The judge said he doesn't believe Martin will flee. "Such a
lengthy time has gone by, and he's demonstrated himself to be a
responsible citizen," Cahalan said.

Guy Dobbs, Martin's lawyer, told Cahalan that Martin has been married
for 26 years, has held various jobs, owns Common Wealth Mortgage of
Livonia, has no criminal convictions, and has raised three children.
He lives in Detroit's Rosedale Park and his wife, Ann, is a secretary
for the Detroit Board of Education.

John Truscott, spokesman for Gov. John Engler, said the governor has
no choice but to sign an extradition warrant to send Martin back to
Virginia. "There's nothing we can do," Truscott said Friday. "That's
the law."

Engler should know: In 1994, he refused to extradite a convicted
Alabama murderer who had escaped from prison after serving 10 years of
a life sentence and built a new life in Michigan. Phillip Chance had
won public support from civil-rights groups, and said he feared for
his life if he were to return to prison in Alabama. But in 1996, a
federal appeals court ruled that Engler could not refuse a legitimate
extradition request, and Chance was sent back to Alabama.

Now, Martin faces the same. "It's such an injustice that we have to
deal with this all over again 22 years later," his wife said. "We
thought this was all behind us."

Martin was arrested in June 1973 for selling two small packages of
marijuana to a fellow employee at a department store in Martinsville.
Martin said in 1976 that he pleaded guilty to the charge because his
lawyer advised him that as a black man accused of selling drugs to a
white woman he wouldn't do well in front of a jury in the small,
mostly white town.

Martinsville's prosecutor told the Free Press on Friday she will fight
to make sure Martin comes back to serve his time.

"I'm a black female, and I'll certainly treat him like I'd treat
anybody else," said Joan Ziglar, Commonwealth's attorney for
Martinsville. "If we encourage every criminal who walks away to never
come back, we'll be in big trouble. I feel very strongly that if
someone is convicted in a court of law and chooses to walk away, they
should be brought back to answer for that. He doesn't have a right to
decide on his own what justice is."

Dobbs, Martin's lawyer, said he plans to ask the governor of Virginia
for a pardon or to recall the warrant. It will likely take at least
three weeks before the extradition request reaches the governor, said
Lila Young, spokeswoman for Gov. Jim Gilmore.

Besides the marijuana and escape charges, Ziglar said, Martin still
had to answer for felony charges of larceny by conversion because he
never paid off a television and stereo system he had purchased on an
installment plan from a Martinsville store. Because he escaped, the
store couldn't locate him or the items and filed felony charges
against him.

Martin's previous extradition battle started in 1974, when he was
stopped in Livonia for making an illegal turn. A check of his driver's
license showed he was wanted in Virginia. A lawyer worked for two
years to try to keep Martin from being sent back.

Among his supporters then were Sen. Carl Levin, a Detroit City Council
member at the time, and U.S. Rep. John Conyers. Milliken granted
Martin legal asylum in Michigan the day before Christmas, 1976.

Since then, Martin had heard nothing further about the case but always
knew there was a risk of being arrested on the Virginia warrants if he
left Michigan, said Gregory Neidle, another Martin lawyer.

oh yeah? i believe that you are stupid. i expressed an opinion i think
will strengthen the scene.

heres what im trying to say. drugs make people accept mediocrity at raves.
ive heard so many people say that raves that were a consensus "crap" were
good because of the "e" they were on. i am very VERY nitpicky, and i wont
spend my money on crap. but it seems that drugs (e especially) cause
people to want to get ripped off and fucked over by promoters. they know
that you will behave in a controllable manner caused by the chemical bliss
of e. this is inacceptable. cease this action, or be destroyed.

them. i have a very bad attitude today. i am very sick.

Whatever happened to Vrave at hyperreal.org?  Is that still used
occasionally?

goddam you people have dirty minds! <snicker>
the reason that sawdust was able to work it's way into my pants was
*not* for the reason most of you people are thinking, but because I was
wearing big pants & a corset, so there was no "shirt barrier" when I sat
down...

that bowling alley's gone now...it got replaced w/ a second amoeba

Planet.  The place is huge, has an amazing selection of everything from
all corners of the globe, _tons_ of used stuff, cd's, 12"s, everything.

it seems like I'm always getting stuck right in front of these.  I don't
know about anyone else, but smoke machines have never seemed to create
much atmosphere for me.  It's especially irritating when they're on the
floor 'cuz they engulf your entire body.  just on saturday at the black
star show (which was extremely cool btw, rangos hall on the second floor
of the university center was literally bouncing up and down!) I was
completely engulfed by smoke several times.  This _really_ sucks.  I
don't care much about dirt or even the paint that was @ magick, but when
you can't see anything except for a cloud of gray and can’t breathe,
that bothers me, as well as being mildly scary at sometimes.  btw, does
anyone know what chemicals are used in smoke machines and how/whether
they're dangerous?  

More dirt, less smoke...

I don't know about all that.  I have only been to two raves, Dawn and
Believe.  At both of these parties, I spent about half of my time
sober.  I was having a blast sober.  The e, definately, was nice, but
I was actually having so much fun at Believe that I considered saving
my pill for Quondam Beats.  Weird huh?

Smoke machines use a glycerin mixture that is passed over a heated hire.  
totally harmless unless you drink a lot, in which case you'll get the runs.

Must not have been a very strong consensus then, eh?

Yeah, I'm sure that's just what they are thinking. "Bring on the

Its not weird at all.  Why didn't you save it then?  If as you said, you
already "felt like you were rollin" before you took it, so why take it?

I'm not trying to talk down to you as a new raver at all (its hella cool
that you come out and post on here), just saying that there are many
highs to the rave experience without drugs.   its the only reason i go. 
You don't have to 'roll' to be down.

If i ever agreed with anything that Tom has said, i definitely agree with
what he said here.  Drugs make people accept mediocrity (or in come cases 
straight up wackness), which is pretty lame.

certain things are unacceptable. dj no-shows due to non-bookings, lack of
rest rooms, expensive bottled water, the list goes on and on. these define
the mediocrity or just plain crappyness of a rave.

it was consensus amongst people who werent under chemical influence. when
the opinions differ to a degree like that, it says something. i know
people who enjoyed the ghetto booty battle.

hey! i pounded more than just a few that night:) well, im not gonna say
that majick was anything less than great. i trust rich and kelly to throw
quality events. it just so happened that my required music for halloween
is evil, thus making majick not really an option. any other day, and i
would have gone just cuz i know rich and kelly have good taste.

whether or not they think it conscientiously is beside the point. their
ignorance is just as bad. "ignorance is bliss" must be one of the most
true things ive ever heard.

> >this is inacceptable. cease this action, or be destroyed.

bad typing, not incorrect grammar. your existence is futile.

> Bad grammar is unacceptable, resistance is futile...

im really trying hard not to be an asshole here, but im really sick, and
my temper is just soaring through the roof, so some of my posts may seem a
bit rude. im sorry. but my opinion is well stated. please think this
through before you take your next pill of e.

This appears to be the kind of tight little generalization made by a
person who doesn't do drugs at parties.  And it's a fine opinion.  I
just have to disagree (not really with Geoff's response, but mostly
with Tom's original post).

To illustrate where I'm coming from ... Last year, the E was great,
and there were a lot of fun parties.  This year, especially in the
last six months, the E has been shit -- hell, it hasn't even been "E"
at all -- and there have still been a lot of fun parties.  My god! 
The pills at Magik were the worst -- and I went nuts dancing anyway,
and I was there until the place shut down.  It was ALL about the
music!  Do some people on this list actually think that all the people
on E are hangin out in dark corners while all the sober people are out
on the dance floor? Please!  

And what's this bullshit about 'socializing at parties' being a bad
thing?  I have met tons of wonderful people at raves, since one of the
things I love to do is walk around and meet people.  If we happen to
sit down somewhere to chit chat for awhile -- what is it to you? Who
are we hurting?  Certainly not 'the scene.'  We're supporting the
scene by simply paying our money to get in.  For me, parties are about
dancing and music, sure, but they're also about making new friends and
hanging out with old ones.

Anyone remember "Technique" last year @ north park?  At one point the 
smoke machine, or its operator just want bonkers, and the place was like
Victorian-era london.  You couldn't see your hand in front of your face.
People were choking.  Dieselboy was tearin' it up with some ultradark
techstep.  "It was, like totally rad".  

this is why i like smoke machines.

i do hear where your coming from...there is overkill.
i'd be willing to go without smoke machines, if people were willing to
not smoke cigarettes.  it sucks having to wash my hoodie that just sat in
my bag all night because it reaks of cigarette smoke.

Hmm.  No cigs wuld kick ass.  but, just as a thought for those disliking 
foggers, no fog, no solid beams of light and lasers really suck.  You need fog 
for all sorts of the cool light effects, like any gobo light(especially 
spinning gobos) and all the lights with multiple beams(avengers, derbystar, 
omega, and so on).  
Oh yeah-anyone ever seen lasers used with mirror balls?  Whiskey Saigon in 
Toronto had at one point a sweet install with a 12 channel laser organ, firing 
at mirrors around the room.  The lasers bounced from mirror to mirror, ~7 ft 
above the ground, and terminated at ~6 mirror balls.  Very nice.  Each laser 
had several different possible targets, and it was sweet.

What really makes me sick is that Percolator came out like 6 or 7 years ago
and its just now getting mainstream club and airplay, although only on mix
shows.
I can't tell you how many people come up to me and ask for that record on
Sundays. Yuk.

OH heck yea!! I really liked this place...room three is gonna be the 
basement isn't it. damn. You can never breathe down there. I just wanted 
to see Nauti Groove in that room...he looks good. Wait, forget the 
'damn', I can get up close in there!! I really am officially happy. and 
officially excited! Woo hoo! Don't get me wrong, he spins cool shit too. 
Fun. But, what to do about free or VERY cheap parking? Friends of mine 
parked behind one of the buildings nearby and had his radio 
lifted....any suggestions?..don't mind walking too far either .

I don't wear anything worth keeping to a party for that reason. I'm not 
there to impress anyone...I'm there to have fun and dance and hear the 
music. I don't care if it's dirty. I tend to meet the most special 
people, the ones I hold closest to my heart, when I look my shittiest. I 
can be myself when I'm relaxed. I'm totaly in my element when I'm  at a 
party.

Although it's not rare that I agree with Tom  (I'm thinking of putting his
picture on my pb-cle t-shirt), this is completely true.  There's nothing more
ridiculous than someone reviewing a party (not just on the list) and saying
how terrible a time they had only to find that it was because of what drug
they did.
Helloooooooo!?!?!?!?!  So, you would have had a terrible time anywhere on
drugs then, right?
Just as annoying is to see how "bomb" that party was!! Only to find that
their roll was what was "bomb" and they probably would have accepted me up
their spinning (and no one wants to hear that!)..
By the way, when reviewing parties on the list it would be nice if people
didn't hold out til the end of the posts to say "It was no fault of the
people throwing the party, the djs, etc.  My underwear was too tight and I
just felt awful about that."  Ya know?

Hmm...i just started going to raves around August of '97.
I didn't know ANYONE when I started going. I kinda felt that way at first too, but then I started talking to people, and  meeting new people and realized that pretty much everyone was vey friendly. You just have to be willing to get out there and make the first move sometimes!
And hey, if your on the list, come to the net meets! We're ALL friendly, and that's exactly what the net meets are for!
:)
Plur,
Patti

i always post to this list and then regret it later, but this time i really
think that i want to say this...i'm sure that there are a million different
reasons why people pay money to go to raves, but who is anyone to say that any
of those reasons are the *right* reasons to go? i must admit that when i first
started going to parties i was too intimidated to dance or pay attention to
what djs i really liked so i talked to people and made friends instead. with
time, that intimidation faded and i quit going to parties to "socialize" and
mostly started going just for the music. when you are first start out in any
scene, it takes a little while to really find out what it is all about. i too
laugh at the silly younger kids who only go to get really fuct up and couldn't
tell you one of the djs spinning, but these kids will most likely grow out of
the scene like most people who aren't in it for the music. the rave trend will
die out with any luck, right?
i'm not making a lot of sense here, i know, but a few minutes ago this all
made sense in my head. i guess what i really want to say is that who is anyone
to judge what makes somebody else happy? if the masses of "e tarded" kids
getting back rubs in the lobby bother you, move closer to the speaker and quit
paying attention to them. their fun doesn't have to ruin yours. 

waiting to regret this post,
danielle

:)  One thing I noticed about parties in this area was _not_enough_fog_!!!

many times it seems there are too much ambient light and not enough fog
(for my tastes anyway). i guess for big parties, saftey is a concern and
promoters don't want to get sued. 

ideal indoor party: enough people so the space is full but enough room to
dance without hitting anybody. enough fog so you can only see the people
immediately next to you. no silly ambient lighting making sure i don't
fall down, just the intelligent lighting. and a quarter-watt blue
animation laser.

fog juice is good for you!!!

hi everyone i'm just writing to give a warning about a few area FAKE "partykids" that go by the names of 
shane and jason from canton. jason has short blond hair and brown side burns and shane is tall and skinny 
with yellow hair. shane has been to my house on a few occations and he was here right before DAWN. he came to 
find out if we were going to DAWN and say whats up. he left right before we left for DAWN. when we returned 
our house had been robbed. shane hasn't been back since. we found out from one of his ex-friends that he 
robbed that he left here called a few of his friends and set the whole thing up. he did not actually do the 
burglary he was at love of life. but he told his friends where most of my valuables were and we would not be 
home all night. they fired six gunshots in my house and stole over $1300 worth of money and guns. luckily i 
am insured so i'll get most of it back but it sort of ruined an up till then very good weekend. if you 
recognize these guys be careful selling anything to them they have grabbed and dashed before. don't let them 
into your home if you want to keep the things you have. 

i'm sorry to leave such a negative message but i'd like to spare any of you the anguish of coming home and 
finding your house robbed after a party. i mean how shady can you be i met these guys by letting them stay a 
few weeks here last spring when they had nowhere else to go. they really know how to say thanks. i have 
learned to be a little more careful about the people i invite into my home they aren't always what they 
pretend to be. 

see you folks at continuum. once again sorry about the negativity. party on

RECLAIM YOUR HOUSE NATION

Recently, our house movement has been under attack from all sides. The
once loving family of united party people have apparently begun to
faction off into many small groups of promoters/ dj's/ and social scenes.
We can't have this!  The never ending search for money, success, and
prestige can drive nearly anyone down to an all time low. Promoters skip
town without paying for services rendered.  Cliquish groups of people snub
those around them. Innocent party people drive long distances
and pay large amounts of money only to find an empty warehouse, or dj's
that weren't that were never on the flyer to begin with. Promoters give
interviews to the press about our scene in order to turn a higher profit. 
All of these things and more are going on around us all the time. 
Obviously this kind of information is a sure fire bummer, but it's these
kinds of problems that will eventually destroy our house nation forever!
Many of us believe that this movement is a meaningful one, full of love
and good people, NOT a money-making business venture. We have the 
potential to come together from all walks of life (regardless of race,
creed, religion, orsexuality) and unite in mind, body, and spirit. It's up
to us to make this happen; without our collective participation, love,
trust, and support, we are nothing.

                 Here are some suggestions from your friends: 

        Do question the cover charge you pay and where that money goes 
        Do question the intentions of a party larger than 500 people 
        Do question your support of negative people, dj's, and promoters 
        Do question your association with people who only seem to talk
		about money and/or drugs 
        Do support a variety of dj's and parties 
        Do know your promoters and who they are involved with 
        Do know if your promotor pays their dj's and staff 
        Do educate yourself and your friends about the drugs you take and
	   all the precautions necessary to protect yourself from harm 
        Do know your sources well 
        Do remember to eat, sleep, and drink a lot of water 
        Do take god care of yourself and your loved ones 
        Do make at least one new friend every party you go to 
        Do love and remember 
        Do forgive and forget 
        Do remember that if someone tells you something about someone else
	   that isn't very nice, that same person is probably saying
	   something that isn't very nice about you when you're not around 
        Do question people who take sides and gossip 
        Do smile often and go out of your way to accept everyone around
	   you 
        Do share (your love, your thoughts, and your drugs) 
        Do remember that you are the power of example to everyone around
	   you.  

We realize that these suggestions may not apply to all situations,
however, it is our belief that information can only make us stronger and
is yours to take or leave as you like.

Only to an extent.  If this were really true, I would never, ever get
anything I didn't want.  Only on a couple very random occasions have I
met dealers who were selling shit, but then after I bitched gave me
good stuff.  And only once or twice has 'knowing the right person'
gotten me anywhere.  And I always carry tons of cash.  It's luck, I
tell you.  More than anything.  

The only time I know of that *really* made 'knowing the right person'
quite helpful, was when a shady little friend of my brother's got to
trade a roll for  (what would have been) a $45 Nexus (2C-B) pill. 
Bastard kid didn't even slightly deserve it.  And I will bet anything
he couldn't appreciate it.  God damn 2C-B being legal everywhere
except the U.S.!  I tell you ... I hear the streets in Switzerland are
paved with the stuff ...

All true. I have also been to parties that were just supposed to be
awesome because some dj or another was playing, and they turned out
shitty for whatever reason. I'm not saying that E is necessary for
a good party, but why not do some if you are having a shitty time?

I didn't enjoy phunction that much, and I had good E. You just never
know.

Just wondering, have you ever had some drinks before you went to a
rave? Which do you think is more likely to kill a vibe, alcohol or
good E? (not the shit that has been going around. MDE is probably
worse than alcohol in this respect.)

this is one of the reasons I loved magick so much.  When it comes down
to it, I'd def prefer a space w/ paint and dirt everywhere but no
cigarettes to a pristine space w/ people smoking.  Sorry to everyone who
smokes out there, but it was so refreshing to come home from magick and
not have screwed up sinuses, burning eyes, and filthy smelling clothes
and hair (I try to avoid washing my hair as much as possible, but it's
usually hard not to after a party).  
	btw, did anyone see the news article that said 60% (tho it might've
been 30) of chinese youths are likely going to die from smoking
cigarettes?  I didn't read much of it so I'm not real clear on it.  it's
sort of ironic that the higher population density a place has, the
higher rate of smokers there seem to be.  I dunno, maybe that's
completely uninformed.

c ya,
Jesse

ps one last piece of anti-smoking propaganda...I hope you all know
smoking causes impotence.  g'day

I think I'm going as well. Even with the long 9 hr drive, I hope I'll still
have some fun. Oh well, I haven't seen Doc, Adam and Claude in a while.

I broke down and bought the 'Generation Ecstasy' book the other day.
I'm about half way through and although it seems to have a lot of names
and facts right, I'm curious as to how exactly this guy got his
information.  I noticed a quote in there from a guy I know and I called
him to see if he knew about it.  He said that he heard about being
included in the book from another dj while on an airplane a month ago.
He has never met the author, Simon Reynolds and definitely wasn't
interviewed by him. He's the guy that was behind the Storm raves in
Brooklyn and although the quotes that are supposedly from him are kind
of simplistic, about him bringing raves from the UK to the US, rave
fashion and e coming to the US, they aren't his.  The facts are right
but the quotes are fake. As a writer this struck me.  Now I'm on a mini
mission to find out if this is the case with others from the US that are
quoted  in the book.

I guess it was worth the money.  I learned a few things I didn't know
before.  It's an ok index of names and dates although it leaves out some
pretty important ones it seems.  I'm not finished with it yet so maybe
my opinion will change.  I'll let yall know.

the whole smoking issue at parties is no different than the smoking issue
anywhere else (restaurants, offices, etc).  smokers infringe on non-smokers
rights.  smokers have the right to smoke outside just like cars do.

I hate being a bum, but if I can't get a ride to Continuum, would anyone be
able to give me a ride to Shift?  I live near Jamestown, NY and wouldn't
really be that much out of the way.  Also, I have a cottage on Chautauqua
Lake we could crash at/hang out at afterwards, with beds, a shower, a
kitchen, turntables, etc.  It's between three and 3.5 hours from Toronto,
so it's roughly halfway from both Pgh. and Cleveland.  Thanks and plur, dan

went to Toronto last weekend for a party, so here is some information that
might be helpful.
We got to the party location at about 10:10 and then parked and got in line
about 10:20.  The line got a LOT bigger just in those few minutes, so my
suggestion would be to have the driver drop everybody off, have them get in
line, and then meet up with them after you park.  I would suggest parking
close to the venue.  I've heard the shuttles are not always reliable...  We
waited in line for over two and a half hours, and we got to the venue
fifteen minutes after the party started, so GET THERE EARLY!!!!!!!  I bet
anyone who got in line after 11 had to wait at least four or five hours or
more, no joke.  Even those with pre-sale tickets had to wait in line, but I
would suggest getting pre-sale if possible to guarantee entry.

Everything is a lot cheaper in Toronto.  We got 5 rolls for $100 Canadian,
which is about $13.50 U.S. each. Individual ones may be slightly more
expensive, but still a good price.

BE CAREFUL WHEN CROSSING THE BORDER!!!  We had the misfortune of getting
stopped by the customs inspectors (is that what they're called?) on the way
back into the U.S.  We were asked to pull over, and the six of us had to go
into this building.  They had already taken our driver's licenses, and they
asked us a series of personal questions.  They asked us if we had any
"personal use" on us (drugs).  In the words of one agent, "It's all right
if you do and tell us now, but if you say you don't and I find anything on
you, it's a different story..."  Well, we didn't fall for his clever
attempt at entrapment, and took our chances.  They searched us pretty
thoroughly, checking our jackets, having us empty out our pockets, patting
us down, having us lift up our pantlegs, and I know they patted down at
least one person's socks.  They also emptied out and thoroughly checked our
wallets and backpacks.  Then they searched our car pretty thoroughly,
informing the car's owner that if they found ANYTHING, he was no longer the
owner of the car.  After this, they did a background check on each of us,
to see if we had a  criminal record.  After luckily finding nothing, they
allowed us to leave, but let me tell you it was a long twenty minutes while
we were detained.  Without incriminating myself, let's just say that the
situation could have been a lot worse if we hadn't been creative.  I won't
post any more details online (e-mail me privately if you need any
suggestions), but if you do have the misfortune to be stopped and have
anything, I described every method they searched us with, and I imagine
unless they find anything they won't be too much more thorough than that.
Just don't be stupid, don't act nervous, and don't leave anything in the
car, because they have all the time in the world...

Of course, all this is based on my only party in Toronto and the only time
I was ever stopped, so each case may be different.  I think we were checked
because there were six of us from three different states, along with our
cracked-out appearance.

Sorry to be such a doomsday prophet.  I had a great time in Toronto.  The
people there are super nice, and you should have a great time if you go.
Chances are, the negatives won't happen to you.  I only bring these things
up to make sure your expererience is the best it can be.  Party safe and
have fun!

plur, dan

I'll bet a million bucks the DOB is killing people because people are
taking too much at a time.  Yeah, it's 30-some times stronger than E
because a good dose of E is 100mgs, and a good dose of DOB is about 2
or 3.

Back in the 60's, DOM (STP) killed a bunch of people too because the
pills were HUGE.  DOM, like DOB, is active in as little as probably
half a milligram -- and some IDIOT was putting it out in 20mg doses.  

Once again, kids are dying because drugs are illegal and unregulated.

agreed that the following DJs have spun out before and/or are good

Lemon Lyman

Oh my god, this fucking ruled!  I have two comments:

1. Those girls in the story -- ever see that busty blonde who always
wears tube tops and was dressed up as a 'sexy cop' at Magik?  She
hangs out with that shadiest of shady dealers, Jay (with the fucked-up
teeth).  Anyway, I was just reminded of her. :-) Dave Schwanke, you
*have* to know who I'm talking about (I pointed her out at Digital
Genesis, out by the porta potties).

2. The term 'narcotics' should only refer to opiates, not coke.

 Ight, looks like it will be middle sized party,
 not in Youngstown, Pb-cle DJs, etc.
 
 Should we all have a pre-emptive net meet?
 As in BBQ or picnic, slumber party, etc?

Hi guys, for those of you that missed the "A" train you will get another
chance.  The next house party will be on JAN. 9th 1999.  The party will be
called Mister Rabs' neighborhood of Make Believe.  Kelly thought it would be a
good idea for the Dj's who are spinning out for the pb-cle party to spin at
this one, first to get a little bit of practice in (although i don't think
most of you guys need any) on your sets. The party will again be in the
pittsburgh area and will be during the day.  it should start at about 1:00pm
and go until about 10:00 pm  the cost will be FREE, but i can only have about
30 or so kids over so E-mail me now to reserve your place.  if you are a dj on
the list of 5 that are definitely spinning at pb-cle e-mail me so i know you
are coming and i will also put your name on the flyer that i am going to
print.  as always i will have party kits to help you enjoy yourself.  E-mail
to MrRab@AOL.com if you are a dj that wants to spin or play please send kelly
at downlow your demo tape....Hope to hear from you soon {;-) peace mark

well, this game is nothing short of amazing. i knew it was gonna be
good, but i was a bit skeptical about the transition to 3d. some of the
new features are a bit akward at first, and the camera angling takes a
bit to get used to, but after that, so far its a damn fine game.
absolutely beautiful, lots of good music, good story line, etc. it has
the feel of a real epic...

also, pearl jam's new live disc is bomb as hell.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

Sat Nov 28                        ENERGIZE                               DC

U L T R A W O R L D 
in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year history.
It is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for it to do to
the dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond.  It will be held in
the massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in this space
before, none will compare to the excellence of Energize.

The main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one
wide-open, high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set
Energize apart from our previous events is that we have now been approved
to use the basement! Don't think basement like dark and dingy though,
this basement has ceilings of 40', and makes the biggest dance clubs on
the East Coast look like efficiency apartments in Manhattan.  Plus it's
divided up into rooms of various sizes. 
For the first time at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all
with full on concert level production in both sound and lighting.  

All performers listed below are confirmed.  The four rooms of Energize
will
be:

The Main Arena:   We will fill this space with the best sound system we
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of lasers,
projection screens and intelligent lights.  The lineup is one of the best
we have ever presented, a true blend of the most prevalent styles of
electronic dance music.  From hard techno, to trance, to funky breaks, to
fun party music, the main room at Energize is going to be all that and
more.  The performers are:

CARL CRAIG performing live as
Paperclip People  Planet E Records, Detroit
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI  Matsuri Productions  London/Tokyo
DOC MARTIN  Los Angeles
ICEY  Zone, Orlando
SCOTT HENRY  Buzz, DC
T1000  Generator/DJax, Detroit
NIGEL RICHARDS  611 Records, Philadelphia

You may have seen that Uberzone was previously listed in the main room.
They
had said they were available, but then decided to cancel all bookings for
the
rest of the year to make time to write new music. 

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena:  In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the
undisputed
champions of the U.K. scene.  This area will be hosted by 2 Tuff
productions
of DC.  The lineup is:

GROOVERIDER  Sony, Prototype, U.K.
FABIO  U.K.
MC GQ  the U.K.'s premier MC
DARA  Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY  Platinum, Philadelphia
AK1200  Orlando
DB  Breakbeat Science, NYC
SLANT  2 Tuff, DC
ENTITY  Ultraworld
FLUID  Sonic Soul, Baltimore
MC DUB2  Philadelphia

The Deep House Arena:  This third area, also in the basement, is bigger
then any dance club on the East Coast.  It will be hosted by
Philadelphia's Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long.  The performers are:

DERRICK CARTER  Chicago
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION  Universal Language, U.K.
FEELGOOD  Charm City Records, Baltimore
KENNY GLASGOW  Toronto
O'KEEFE  Circle, Philly
ROB PAINE  Circle, Philly
SEAN THOMAS  Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena:  The smallest area of the event, but still bigger
then the main room at most clubs!  This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
respected Sonic Soul crew, and will feature the downtempo side of
electronic music.  You can dance if you want to, with performers:

TIM "LOVE" LEE  Tummy Touch, U.K.
PETE LAWRENCE  the Big Chill, U.K.
WE performing live  Asphodel, NYC
LOVEGROVE  Sonic Soul
DJ C  Toneburst, Boston
RHOMBUS  Sonic Soul

What makes this event even more exciting, is the fact that it will be a
collaborative effort between Ultraworld, Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.
While Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction for
the event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically manage
the areas of music they are most interested in.  What that means for you
is that you get the highest quality of production and care going into
every aspect of the event.

Tickets will be on sale in the DC/Baltimore area on September 30, and
should be at all of the outlets by October 3, and will be broken down as
follows:

There will be 1000 tickets sold for only $20!   So if you know you're
going to go, you have the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low
price.  We are accepting orders for these tickets now, or you can wait
until they are at the outlets. If you'd like to mail order your ticket,
send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER ONLY, made out to Ultraworld Productions for $20
per ticket ordered.  Send it to:

Ultraworld Productions
3042 O'Donnell St
Baltimore, MD  21224

After those 1000 are gone the price will be $25 up to and including
October 31.  

On November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that
price even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets.  Admission at the
gate will be $35.

Also, we are working with the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend.
For those of you who may not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held
every Friday by DJ's Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt.  It plays host to
the world's top DJ's and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of
the best in the country.  When you purchase your ticket to Energize, there
will be a stub which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for
only $5  (Note: Tickets purchased through Ticketmaster will not have this
stub, but Buzz will honor the $5 admission).   Consider coming to DC on
Friday, and making a long stay of it.  We'll post hotel and travel info on
this site in the weeks to come. 

To stay in DC, try these hotels:
Phoenix Park Hotel (closest to venue)	202.638.6900
Best Western (closest to Buzz & afterparty)	202.488.7500
Holiday Inn				202.383.3838

Well, it takes a lot to excite me (sometimes) but I'll have to say that
I'm more excited about Mr.Charles than turkey right now (although I made
the BOMB stuffing w/ cranberries, nuts, mmmmmmm!)  Anyway, just a
reminder/confirmation that Feelgood will be here in Pittsburgh tonight
at Metropole.  He is one of my top 5 personal favs so you all need to
get off the couch tonight and come on down!!
$4, I think.  not more than $5 though.
Happy Thanksgivin'

For anyone who's bored, here's a quick survey question:

hmm...okay, so i heard once that -e- lowers your seratonin level, so, if that's true, and Turkey raises your seratonin level, would they cancel each other out? :)
(btw, it's just a silly question, im not being serious)
I hope everyone has a very nice Thanksgiving, and remember to give thanks for everything you have on your table today, there are many people in this world who will have to go without.

ahhhh once again hotmail is returning mails for no apparent reason, random
users and stuff...   they say user unknown, and well i know they're out
there  ;)
and yahoo mail has had a mass bouncing from most users.  i've had to unsub
alot of them and hotmail has been nothing but a headace since day one.
so if you have one of these and get unsubbed, its because of bouncing
emails and such.

well, let's do an experiment and see.  place one dose of mdma next to the linen napkin of each family member.  you can tell them it's one of those fast acting anti-acid pills they
advertise on tv. after the gravy boat is empty and it's time for punkin pie you should have your answer.

this experiment is inconclusive.  if it is thanksgiving, your older
relatives are probably eating with you.  most likely, one of them is on an
IMAO, MAO, or SSRI (or all three for real fuckups).  make sure you do
background checks on everyone eating.  our results will sparkle.

it seems as though tuesday night (november 24th) was the final steel
city jungle
(at least at laga, for a while).  this is a tragedy for all pgh jungle
kids, and underground music in general.  it just shows that we have to
support the djs and venues that we have, because its really easy to
loose
em, even in 1998.  the pbs crew just wanted to say, *MASSIVE BIG-UPS* to

the SCJ crew for putting on such a quality event as long as you did, and

particularly dj sine for killing us with a wicked set just about every
week.  we definitly always looked forward to tuesday nights, and its sad

to see it go.  nothing but respect.

Yeah except for that DJ Sine and Bagel, you could really notice that by
quailty of some of the talent spinning, tings were going downhill ;)

I went tuesday and had a slammin time, i am gonna miss it.
I remember my first scj at cafe 168 and hope there is something to replace
it perhaps at a smaller venue, maybe even with something else thrown into
the mix for variety

happpy t-day and see yinz at da bomb

plur,

Listen to this . . . I heard of this thing called "Tofurkey".  It's a
vegetarian turkey made out of TOFU!  It's in the shape of a turkey . .
. and get this: since everybody likes the drumsticks, they made four
of them!

Ahh . . . the wonders of modern technology :)

Hey Happy Thanksgiving or Thursday :-)

Now that everything has settled I would like to say a few words. One again
thanks for coming out to Phage 99.9% of you were A+ except for a few which I
will address later. I would like to thanks our entire staff you were al great
without you this event never could have happened. The DJ's loved the crowd and
the event and esp. the building.

Now to address the few who I can honestly say have completely ruined the
rave/party/electronic music scene (call it what you want) in Buffalo. As I
stated there was a lot riding on this event. City Hall has been getting a lot
of slack about kids "Ging" out and considering themselves above the law. This
in turn has caused extensive flack with the Police and Fire Department. Now I
said this party meant the direction for events in Buffalo and I wasn't
kidding. This event was highly monitored by the city and we spent weeks,
excuse me months getting the city behind us to say hey we feel we have a
solution to your problem and we want to show you that these kid can be cool
(Which most of you were). So they gave us their cautious blessings. Now as you
know I said please everyone be cool and this will change things. Of course at
Phage we found 4 kids dealing "G" which caused 3 ambulance calls and 1 kid
almost died. This morning I received a phone call from city officials stating
that they wanted to meet with Jeff and myself this week with the Capt. of the
Fire Department, The Police Department and some city officials. They said they
we ran a tight ship but it looks like the future for events in this community
are over for all, however they want to talk. In short you 4 assholes have
ruined it for Buffalo all around. The city plans in the future or so they say
that any event that has "rave" attached to it will be shut down, with or
without permits period. They have the right and they are going to do it. If
you don't believe me throw and event and see, also they now are going to come
down super hard on Marcella's and try to effect a shut down. Just when we had
a solution to the problem you have to go and ruin it even after I alerted you
all to what was up. I hope you are proud of yourselves for making a measly
$100.00 or so and costing us so much.

So here is the skinny. Now that you have placed us (Offworld) in the hot seat,
lost us $ 1,000's for insurance claims and now most likely ruined the scene I
have a few personal words to say to you (Please list members pass this along
to them). I am a pretty low keyed guy but now that you have fucked with my
life personally I am now pissed. You stupid mother fucking petty scum bags
that you are, you think you are so smart and you feel you can get away with
shit like this let me tell you the bottom line. We know who you are 3-guys-1
girl, we had you pegged 20 minutes after the fact by myself and several of our
close friends. I (Offworld) stopped the police from arresting you. Dealing in
the basement in front of hidden cameras with video tape, please are you dumb.
Also there were several undercover narcotics officers in the crowd actually
having fun and 2 of you sold them and their associates. I told the police to
not arrest you and let us stop it. We tried to get a message to you and you
still did it, but finally stopped. Now that I have been given all this grief
and you signally have "fucked" the scene for Buffalo, I would like to share a
bit of my pain with you. I know who you are and I am taking you out. No, I am
not getting you arrested. I am just saying watch your back, because your ass
is mine. You life is now about to experience a serious string of bad luck. And
trust me I have a first hand insight on this. If you think I am kidding, ask
around. If I see you out and I get a chance I am going to mess you up, and so
will others and after we are done with you we will pour your bottle of G down
your fucking throat and leave you in the fields to rot. I hope you understand
I am not kidding. Offworld tried to do this community a favor and we bust our
asses to better electronic music in this area and you pull this shit... Once
again.. your mine !!!!

Scott

Tom, 
I just wanted to let you know that you guys would have had a ton of support this past Tuesday, but they were turning people away at the door because of id's. Now, i understand that they got raided last weekend by LCB and they have to be careful about who they let in and all.. my ID is expired, however, i have a piece of paper from the dmv making it legal for 30 days, and they wouldn't accept it. So me, and the 5 people that came with me, couldn't get it. We stood on the sidewalk and watch about 10 more people get turned away because of something being wrong with their Id's, mostly expired ones...
I'm not really bitching, I just wanted to let ya know why i wasn't there, i really wanted to be there when you spun..sorree!!
Catch ya next time though!!
:)
Plur,
Patti

SAdd sad sad  about SCJ. I am considering the fact that i live in 
columbus, I haven't been able to support.  This summer I would go alone 
to SCJ just because I had to go.  The dj quality had went down 
occasionally but i had hope.  And now that I am back and I just missed 
the supposed last one I am depressed as hell. I came home Tuesday at 
1230pm and I was just gonna show but no I did not.  And how do I regret 
it now:(  Yes support your scene---the more you support the better it 
will get. In columbus, I try my best.  And its not too bad. So in 
Pittburgh, I hope you do too. Lets see we got Atomic tonight--suggest 
that everyone show(feelgood time).  Keep it livin'. Keep it movin'

I mean everyone.

Let's have a moment of silence for SCJ . . .




It was the longest running jungle night in the entire United States. 
It nurtured and encouraged HUGE jungle stars like Dieselboy, 187,
Sine, Circuit 6 and others.  It gave those who would never be booked
by anybody in their right mind (toM Cox :) a chance to be heard.

But seriously:
Best of all it was a place where you could go and dance your ass off
to some of the best jungle around at a low cost.  If it wasn't for
SteelCityJungle I definitely would NOT be the person I am today.  It
opened my mind and constantly pushed the boundries of my musical taste
even within jungle itself.

So because of this, SCJ Crew: I implore, NO I BEG you . . . DO NOT LET
IT END LIKE THIS!  Are you going to let an incredible milestone and
important night in the history of the PGH die off like this?  Make it
go out with a bang.  Throw a party called SteelCityJungle . . . bring
back dieselboy, bring back 187, bring back Farmer Tea, bring back Girl
13, bring back everyone for one last jam.

I would hate to see such a good thing come to such an anti-climatic
end (no offense intended at all to Tom, Bagel or Sine).

scj was one of my first exposures to the scene.  It was where I realized
I could dance like an asshole, completely disreguard the fact that I had
no talent at it, and not get even a funny look.  I heard a lot of damn
good music thru that club night, and have several very special memories
from it that I will always remember.  I was worried about this
happening, especially w/ the start-up of on. I hope that this can stay
alive in some form or another. 

Thanks for your hard work and extreme friendliness,
Jesse

Alright, I'm out of lurk mode.
    I've been on the PB-CLE list for a few days now and I've been quiet, I'm
trying to get a grasp on what the scene here is.  Luckally dispite this
message I've still got faith in the scene around here.
    PLUR right?  Where's the love in this message?  The cops will shut down
parties IF THEY CAN (health/fire/etc. infractions) no matter what we do.
They know the drugs are there and will arrest those distributing them.  Cops
understand that it's not the fault of the production crew if an individual
that attends their otherwise legal event brings illegal items.  Parties
aren't JUST shut down because of the G although I agree that G shouldn't be
part of the scene because it KILLS and that is certainly not what we're
about.  I just moved here from Colorado where the scene contains G as well.
I finally find this list and read the same basic message sets that I have
read from the MTN-RAVER list, except this one.  This one caught me off
guard.  A raver.  One of the people that I dance with, one of the people I
expect I can come up and give a hug instead of a handshake as I introducing
myself.  This message makes me think that there's a knife ready to be thrust
into my back as soon as I partake in that hug.
    As a member of a production crew I can honestly say that WE CAN NOT
control the controlled substances at a party.  It is not our responsibility.
If you throw a party that's worth a shite you can expect someone to show up
with elicit substances.  This is beyond our control.  Most every production
crew realizes this.  Unfortunately not everyone going to raves knows that
you can still have a hell of a time SOBER.
    My production crew not only throws events for third world countries and
non-profit organizations, one of which is US so that we can throw further
events to help out those truly in monitary need.  None of the members of my
organization EVER profited from any of the events we threw/helped throw.
That's one key to keeping the scene alive.  Another is to (as a production
crew) attempt to educate those that attend your events on the drugs that the
"lawless ones" may bring to your party.  Tell them what the affects of the
drugs are, what's too much, what to look out for.  PLUR.  Release
newsletters and pamphlets containing this type of information with a list of
your future events killing two birds with one stone.
    I love this scene.  I used to think I loved everyone in it, but now I'll
just say I love MOST of you.  Be Positive.  The scene will come around.
Drug education will improve (with help) and the scene will consist of
inconceivable amounts of parties.  Big and small.  Legal.  Everything
evolves.  This scene needs all the help it can get to evolve to this point.
Good vibes, not bad.  I can't understand this outburts.  It's not us.

Thank you for reading my wordy opinion.  I hope you like it.  Keep it real.
LOVE,
--j

id love to ignore them, but they seem to take up 95% of the room at raves. plus,
seeing people blowing vapo rub in each others faces makes me violent. and theres
only one person i will hug when hes on "e". he knows who he is. everyone else best
stay away. im gonna start sporting a shirt that says " if youre on "e" stay the
fuck away from me." perhaps it will help me ignore them. i estimate 50%+ kids at
raves are rolling. thats too damn bad.toM

how can you not disagree with geoff when he agreed with the entire point i
made in my email?ive done drugs at parties. i just realized that it is
counterproductive. there are lots of other un things to do at raves, so
why not do the drugs some other time when youre bored. i realized that by
being fucked up, i was missing the whole point of raving. why do e at a
rave? why not do it at your house instead of paying 15$ to sit on the
floor getting backrubs? it seems like they are missing the point of raving
also. to me, a perfect rave would be in a warehouse packed pretty tight
with people, all just going buck wild to some crazy ass hardcore and
jungle. now, in all actuality, most raves involve a drugged out dancefloor
that occupies 10%of the space, while the other 90% "socialize" and give
massages etc. i cant see the point in doing this at a rave. why not do it
at indie rock shows because at least there the music sucks. (just kidding,
but you must understand what im getting at)

everything (not just hugs) seems fake to me when someone is on e. ive seen
people who detest jungle dancing to it because they were rolling. it make
people happy with whatever is thrown their way. i fond that to be very
irritating.

i never said it was bad, but when that is 75% of the party, i just think
that people arent getting it. i dont think that the general public is
ready for raving yet. they enjoy the drug use. theyre not real ravers to
me. to me, real ravers are people like david schwanke, geoff, john
pozecki, kay, etc. they are all really into the entire concept of raving,
not the styles, or the social aspects, or primarily the drugs. raving
should be a collective of "other" people, not ravers.i dont like the
concept of ravers. i wish i could go to a rave with no ravers at it, just
other people going nuts.

Here is my view.  I entered this rave world a innocent babe 2 yrs ago. 
Never wanted to touch the stuff(rolls), I had no need at all. E'd out 
anybodys didn't bother me, just could connect with the "not fully 
conscious". I enjoyed myself---I loved it. The scene never appeared so 
great.  

Then on my b'day I was introduced(about a year later).  I don't know why 
I did it.  I shouldn't have. I really really shouldn't have.(that is the 
advice I would give E-virgins). I knew i had this addictive personality 
and i did it.  It was great. Stomach hurt but who cared.  Right????

I didn't do it for awhile.  But I found myself wanting and wanting.  
Why.......I was so happy with the music, the underground, vibe, people, 
everything....  I went back into that world.  And I got sucked in.  
Losing control, dumb----brain cells--serotonin(neurotransmitters)--lost.  
So who say this is not addictive. 

I wish people would stop doing it.  Maybe I could stop.  I have takin a 
break presently its been three weeks(should I be proud of that).  I wish 
people would stop asking me, "Are you rollin". Because I am not.



I am not sickened by the drugs. I envy the users. This is my view, my 
sad story.  Lets just hope I can continue this non-roll streak. I 
appreciate the neg-drug view.  Peace and respect to that. Believe me it 
helps--it really helps to have straight edge friends. So if you guys(non 
users)  see me at a party please support.  And while your at it I bet 
there are others out there like me.

Remember It takes alittle concern and caring to help out the e'tarded 
crowd.  

Hope no one is offended or amused by this.  this is not meant to be 
funny.
Takes us to change the world.

You won't hear those crack out messages from me anymore
Perhaps I grew up.

PLUR to all
benny

CONTINUUM will be an ALL-AGES event.  It will begin at 11 PM (note the time
change from the flyer which said 10 PM) and will end at 9 AM.  We will have
massive sound from Midnight Blue and Wizard Workshop, and intelligent lighting
from Electrolyte FX.  
Several tape vendors have already reserved space, as well as several art and
clothing vendors, so you may want to bring extra money.  There will be plenty
of free parking available.  We are expecting a fairly decent-sized crowd, so
there will not be any re-entry until 2 AM (sorry, but it is VERY difficult to
keep track of people going in and out through a large line).

up on your righthand side.  The venue is called the USA Skating Place.  It is
a large white building with blue lettering.  It is located in a plaza along
with a bowling alley and a Dave's Supermarket.  The address is 3475 Ridge Rd.
It is located directly on the corner of Ridge and Denison Ave.  If you get
lost, call us there at 216.281.6901 (only in an emergency).  If there is any
unfavourable weather, we will have tarps hung around the front and side of the
building, so that those waiting in line won't have to be exposed to the
elements (i.e. rain, wind, snow).

If you are coming in from out of town, the venue is located about 10 minutes
from the Airport, so any hotels around there would very accessible from the
venue.

Now this is just my opinion on thee whole matter.  I beleive thee rave scene
which basically began in Manchester England in 1986 by Genisis P. Orridge (
aka. Jack tha Tab) at such clubs Acid-House Clubs such as Shoom consists ov
several elements.
	First ov all thee music.
	Second thee Dance.
	Third thee People.
	Fourth thee drugz.
	And last but not least thee Love. ( Love is thee Law )
I beleive that these elements are each an impotant part ov our scene.  If one
ov these elements is out ov focus then it throws thee entire scene out ov
balance.
	Ex....(and a mistake I am ashamed to admit took part in at one point in time
but have made amends since) is thee fact that thee shortage ov tr00 substances
has become more and more scarce.  So people create their own little
concoctions to pass as a pill ov E, or a bag ov Methylamine.  Thus throwing
thee balance off and causing shadyness amongst thee kids.......and if it keeps
heading in this direction we just may see thee scene disentegrate.  I see less
and less tr00 kids every week.  Now some ov you may not think much ov me, I
really don't care either way cause I know deep down inside I am a tr00 kid and
I am sure many ov you are too.
	On thee other hand it does bother me to see so many kidz just sitting in tha
same spot all night doing nuthing but trying to get more and more fucked up.
Now I totally admit doing drugs probably 75% ov parties I go to, but it does
not consume my entire night.
I enjoy popping one pill ov E and dancing my ass off all night.  And it does
bother me that their are always kidz sittin around in tha way ov good dancin
turf.  Another thing that bothers me is thee whole ego, status thing that is
going on right now.  I mean 75% ov girlz in tha scene only seem to be
attrected to tha guys with drugs in their pockets hopng to score some free
dope.  Might as well go be crack whores downtown in some city if u ask me. 
	But I am also against Condeming people for doing what makes them
happy......cause it takes all kinds.  I am more for educating people on things
and promoting unity in an illuminati fashon.  It makes me very happy to see
flyerz being passed around educating people on thee substances they are
ingesting and I would like to see more ov it.
	Now I love thee scene and I always will.....its thee closest thing to a
family I have.  I want to see it flourish, and become united again.  But agree
with it or not....drugz are an element ov thee scene that is necasarry to
create thee balance....and it has been for years.  Along with that part
disentigrating everything else will begin to desintegrat. Thee love, Thee
music ( which I beleive is going downhill sorry if offend Ne-1), thee dance (
runnin out ov room to move/venues to small/parties over promoted), then
eventually thee people will begin to disentegrate.......and thus no more
scene.
I see it begining to happen now.
But this process can be stopped.
Educate.

Ok, I have to respond to this one.  I've already sent this guy a personal
message giving him my straight up, 100% support.  I feel for him and it
completely sucks when a promoter is put in that situation.  I've been there.

VibeRidden wrote:

>   Where's the love in this message?

The love is for the scene!!  It's there.  If there weren't people with this
attitude throwing parties, things would completely suck.  There are too many
promoters out there who do "just enough to get by".  "Someone else will take
care of it.  If I just make sure I search everyone's backpack and take any
morsel of fun I find in there, then I've done my job." If anything, the
promoters who have people searched and take their personal use stuff are really
making things dangerous.  If someone is SMART enough to plan ahead and bring
themselves one of whatever to take, then great!  One less deal you'll have go
down at your party.  Doing half-assed searches at the door is a complete waste
of time.  The shit always gets in.  It's just the not-so-clever ones that get
caught.

It's attitudes like this guy's (the pissed promoter)  that keep nasty shit out
(usually, not in this case unfortunately).  What would the chances of getting
any results be if his message read like this:
"Um, I'm a promoter and well, there's this nasty stuff called g coming into
parties around here and I'd really appreciate it if maybe you guys could keep it
at home?  I really love all of you and want you to have a blast and feel the
good vibrations but g really doesn't belong at raves and it's effects are quite
disturbing.  Once again, no hard feelings.  I know that you g dealers are honest
folks just trying to make a dollar.  Maybe we can have lunch some time to
discuss this.  Whadda ya say?  Hey, have a great, positive day!"

The people he's talking to aren't positive themselves.  They're friggin' nasty
drug dealers who probably don't care what they're selling as long as it's making
them some money.  They don't need to be dealt with with PLUR.  They need the
crap scared out of them so that they go away!

Do prostitutes jump up and down on street corners shouting "Hey, lookie over
here!!  I'm a hooker and I want to fuck right now!!  Hey you, over there!!"

No, they're a little more subtle than that.  We do not need to attract attention
is what I'm saying.

> They know the drugs are there and will arrest those distributing them.

No.  They will save themselves a lot of time and shut the party down.  And if
they don't, incidents like these leave scars that can never go away.
Baltimore/DC anyone??

No, cops need an excuse to fuck with you.  And the more there are, the better
chances of the party being shut down.  AMBULANCES AT PARTIES = BAD.  Red freakin
flag!!

Not if you aren't doing anything wrong.

THIS IS INSANE!!  It most certainly is our job.  Who's freakin' job is it then?
I'm sorry, but this reeeeally makes me mad.  I, for one, am extremely proud to
say that my partner and I have been instrumental in 1. getting the vibe killer K
out of our city (or at least getting the pushers to stay home with it) and 2.
chasing out people coming to our city to sell bunk shit to people.  A promoter's
job isn't to design a shiny flyer and collect DJ contracts and book hotels.
That's where it begins.  Go promote rock concerts if you don't want the stress
of the culture we're involved with.  I can guarantee that if you do not take an
active roll in ALL aspects of what's going on at your parties and others in your
area, you will NOT succeed.  Sure, you might throw some mediocre or even a
successful party or two.  But that's not what it's all about.  Whether or not
you like it, you must in some way be connected with all that goes on.  I feel
that we've got this covered better than anyone around here (sorry for the
personal horn toot) and ya know, we don't even search people at our parties.
That's how confident we are about what's coming in.  We threw our first solo
party just this year and we've (Rich especially) been working our asses off
since '93 doing exactly what I'm talking about here.  I really think that it
would be difficult for outsiders to come into this city and do what they're
doing in other places (read the Details article).  And I know no one here is
going to do it.

yes.

> This is beyond our control.

no

Obviously it's hard to know everyone and keep tabs on who's doing what.  But
with some effort you can for the most part monitor what's going on.  Just like
there are undercover cops, you need eyes and ears everywhere for you at an
event.  I've known within 10 minutes of them being there when people have showed
up at my parties with stuff I didn't want in there.  And they and their stuff
were escorted out.

And one key to keeping me alive is food and shelter.  ??  It's not wrong to
profit from throwing a party.  This isn't charity work.

WORD!!  The city I've been to that does this a lot is Toronto.  We definitely
could use a little more of this here.  This is a drug culture.  Like it or not.
There is a reason that raves go all night.  It wasn't that back in the day they
just loved the music so much that they couldn't stand the thought of going
home.  There would be no scene without drugs.  Period.

>     I love this scene.  I used to think I loved everyone in it,

I doubt it.  I know I sure don't. (I just like Josh Wink and Tom Cox, actually)
It's a small percentage of the population and every type of person that is
represented "out there" is present "in here".  You can be sure of it.

> but now I'll
> just say I love MOST of you.  Be Positive.  The scene will come around.

Nope.  That's just like the happy-go-lucky housewife that thinks that if she
puts a delicious meal on the table each evening and shines her abusive husband's
shoes that the wife beater will eventually "come around" and treat her right.
People don't just "come around".  They are either influenced/manipulated/forced
to change or they remain stuck or happily stayed-put in the same place.  That
influence needs to come from some "higher up".  And in this situation, it's the
promoter.

I don't believe that he was yelling at us.  He posted his message to all of the
lists in hopes that someone involved or their friend or their cousin or their
cousin's friend would read it and pass the message onto them.  These people
(drug dealers) are scarey!  And they are bold.  If necessary we need to take a
minute out from PLURing all over the place and be scarey and bold right back.
It works!!  I've seen it work.

Sorry to bore those of you who simply like to go to parties and have fun.  This
is mostly promoter talk but since there are some on the list, I figure this is
appropriate.  This is not about GoodLovin Productions vs. HaveANiceDay
Productions vs. ShakeYourGrooveThang Productions.  It's one big interconnected
web.  Especially in our home cities, we need to stay aware of what's happening
around us.  Not simply who the bomb DJ is or who prints the flyers at the lowest
cost.  We need to be aware of who's doing what and to feed off of each other's
successes and failures.  I always point stuff out to other promoters that I
think might benefit them.  I've yet to have anyone do this with me and I wish
that they would.  When our cities have jokes of events actually go down, we ALL
look like idiots.  If someone from Timbucktwo comes to my city for the first
time and goes to a ridiculous event thrown by someone who hasn't a clue, I'M
PISSED!  Because, you know what?  I have a guarantee that they won't be back in
a month or two for my party.  WE'VE lost them.  And the same goes for situations
like the mad promoter was talking about in the original post.  You can't take
screw ups like this off the record.  Especially when the authorities are
involved.  And it makes all of our lives more difficult.  If you (promoter,
raver, prostitute) see something going on around you that you think could
potentially trickle down and affect all of us, TELL SOMEONE!!  Tell me, tell
anyone who will listen!  We can't ignore and PLUR our lives away.  The same
thing that has happened to scenes in big cities can happen to us too.  Be
responsible and be aware.

I need to sleep.  This has to be my longest post ever.

WaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaHoooooooooooooo!!  Feelgood was awesome.  I've never
enjoyed myself more at Metropol.  Wait, I don't think I've ever even enjoyed

overall, i tend to dismiss without reguard "charters" or whatever else you would call
something like this. also, i dislike the p.l.u.r. ideal. i believe that respect etc.
should only be given where it is due. i do gove people the benefit of the doubt, but
after repeatedly demonstrating that they are not worth my respect, peace, unity, and
love, i dont give it to them. they dont deserve it. its not easy to win m affection in
any way.

so basically, i think things like this quote etc. speak only for those who cant speak
themsleves.

This again brings us back to the entire real/fake feelings thing.  And
I really don't think it is right to say that everything is fake
because it isn't.  When you say "it makes people happy with whatever
is thrown their way" that is not true at all.  I know people who are
naturally unhappy and disturbed and when they roll they don't get
happy . . . they get more unhappy.  AND EVEN IF it did make everybody
(even the meanies) happy . . . why is that a bad thing?  I think it's
good to explore different ways of looking at things and extreme
happiness is no exception.
On the other hand though: why would you want to be that happy if
you're not going to be like that the rest of your life?  Because it is
fun and it is an incredible experience.
I think the feelings induced by rolling IS natural because it is
PRODUCED naturally . . . it is merely given a helping hand in doing it.

as far as whether or not it is good or bad . . . I would NEVER make a
generalization about this, because it is different for every people. 
And I'm not just speaking of rolling.  I mean I know people who have
used substances since they were 11 and have mantained a happy life
with what looks like a great future a head of them.  On the other hand
I've seen people who haven't used anything since a year and a half
ago, and drugs have completely ruined their life and sent them to
prison.  This WAS because of the rave scene.

It's sad that this can happen . . . but when it all comes down to it,
it is the persons and ONLY the persons responsibility.  It's not right
to deprive tons of people fun because some people couldn't handle the
responsibility of having anything they want at their fingertips.

yup...

'tis a cryin' shame to see s.c.j. disappear once again (and without
any warning.) props to everyone involved for keepin it goin' even
where there were only 20 people who ended up showin for top quality
jungle bizness. just about every other tuesday nite that i didn't have
school the next day was spent there, and although i missed quite a
few, i doubt i'll ever forget seeing laga get completely
mashed-the-fuck-up by all sorts of junglists, local and worldwide.

andy... i've heard rumors that you're leavin the burgh... is this
true? wanna fill the list in?

that's YOU.
       ^^^

because it is the single best place you can do e. reasons:
1) the music
2) the people
3) the vibe
4) the _______
5) the _______

if that's all you're doing, then i guess it doesn't make much of a
difference where you do it, but when i'm rollin, i pretty much do 2
things, DANCE + ENJOY THE MUSIC. how is there any harm in that? i dont
see it.

the backrub e-tards, yeah... not completely but they are missing what

yeah it is irritating, but why must you go off on crazy ass rampages
worrying about this bullshit. you can't do anything to stop it. raves
are a personal issue to everyone, there's no need to tell people how
they should feel about them, especailly if it in the wack ass way you
are trying to get the message aross, cause no one's gonna listen to you.

	Let me state here, on behalf of Andy (Sine) and myself, we
	appreaciate all of the posts regarding the night. What
	I would also like to note, however, is that SCJ did not
	die becuase of "On", nor did it die becuase of lack of promotion
	or lack of talent. SCJ is dead becuase our city, Pittsburgh,
	gave up on us. SCJ is dead becuase people in this city
	still don't understand, without constant support, things
	go away. I've seen this happen too many times, it's infuriating
	and frustrating.

	Sorry we didn't go out with a bang? Did you
	really believe any of the fair-weather ravers in PGH would
	have turned out? I have my doubts. 

	So thanks to those who came and supported us, we know who 
	you are, and you've got our utmost respect, you were behind us
	even when we didn't have Dieselboy playing.

	But to those of you who felt you could just make it "next time"
	or believed your evening could be better spent sitting at
	home getting high. Fuck you.

	Thanks again to those that know.

He made some points which were not quite as extreme as yours, and
besides, I've gathered that he's a generally nice person.

MDMA does *not* make you want to sit on the floor.  Many people I know
buy "E" at parties, knowing they probably won't get it; but since
there is always the off-hand chance that they will, they buy it 'just
in case.'  MDE sucks, and may very well be contributing to a
less-than-enthusiastic raver contingency.  Having MDE at a party is
about as productive as having a bunch of kids on K.  In this respect,
I agree with you.

> everything (not just hugs) seems fake to me when someone is on e.

Yep, that was me at Phorm.  And I ain't apologizing to no one!  Can I
tell you how much I HATE fucking jungle.  Lucky thing I was still able
to have fun.  ;-P
Would you rather I have sat around, having a terrible time?  I think
you would.

> people happy with whatever is thrown their way. 

Wrong.  Ever had to babysit a kid freaking out on acid?  Even the best
E in the world won't make that fun.

And just for your information, do you know how many sober people are
sitting around on the floor at 4AM?  Tons of them, because they're
tired.

I'm afraid I don't understand.  Methylamine?!!  Methylamine is not a
drug; it's a chemical used in one step of the MDMA synthesis (although
it can also be used to tan hides).

The only flyer I've seen has had incorrect, unresearched information.

Are you implying that Tom isn't a generally nice person?  I have evidence
to prove that this is not true.  I've seen him passing out candy at
parties, opening doors for old ladies, distributing ground scores among the
tired party-goers in the morning, and in general spreading love all over
this city of ours.  And for those of you who think that he didn't go to
Magick.  You're wrong.  He was so tuckered out from shoveling sawdust into
corners (for the love of the scene) that he was sleeping the whole time in
the tool shed in the back of the warehouse.  You're way out of line on this
one.  I think Tom is the nicest darn person on this list.  And I'm not just
saying that because he said that I have good taste either.
*btw, this is total crap.  but i do happen to agree with his opinion on the
e=wimp ass lack of good judgment attitude tip.  e doesn't enhance shit.  it
twists your reality into a big fat excuse so that when it's over you're
pissed as hell that you tricked yourself like that.  it's why so many
people can't enjoy themselves w/out being on something.  rave reality=being
messed up.  but still, it's all good if that's what you wanna do.  i
personally get more out of a good back rub when i'm sober.

Has Ecstasy helped bridge the gulf between Catholics and Protestants?
 

Ever since I started work on E for Ecstasy in 1993, I heard rumours that t=
he
effect of young people taking Ecstasy at raves in Northern Ireland was to
break down sectarian barriers. In the summer of 1994, just before the IRA
ceasefire, I spent 3 days in Northern Ireland visiting a Catholic club one
night and a Protestant club the next.

I interviewed teenage kids at a rave event in the Catholic club with a hom=
e
video camera. As news spread as to what I was doing, lots of them were kee=
n to
tell me about the friendships they had made with members of the opposite s=
ect
who, they assured me, they would never have met otherwise. But interviewin=
g
people on E turned out to be harder than I had expected: they were clearly=
 not
in the mood for an intellectual discussion. One boy demonstrated his affec=
tion
instead, picking up his smaller friend and whirling him around!

The scene was fairly new, and drew a very young crowd, nearly all of them
under 20 and down to 14. Their behaviour was delightful, fresh and sweet; =
just
like the good old days of raves in England four years previously. I soon c=
ame
to realise that it was not only Ecstasy, but the whole rave scene that had
opened up new ways of meeting: the music and dancing, the non-partisan ven=
ues
and more young people with cars to reach them. In the pre-rave culture, di=
scos
were known to be either Catholic or Protestant according to their location=
,
but rave clubs drew from a wider clientele including both factions.

In one club I was introduced to a dealer who explained how the paramilitar=
ies
controlled the supply of drugs by monopolising the wholesale market. The
dealers were not paramilitaries themselves, but were allowed to operate
providing they bought from para sources at inflated prices: =A39.50 each
(instead of about =A38 each when buying 100 down to =A33-=A34 a thousand).=
 So
although the retail price of =A315 was the same as in England, each punter
contributed about =A36 to the paras. Dealers would sell openly inside the =
club
just after being frisked by security, watched over by a known member of th=
e
UVF.

Started by the Loyalists and copied by the IRA, each side controlled clubs=
 in
their own territory, eliminating competition by punishment beatings. Neith=
er
of the main paramilitary groups admitted to being involved which may have =
been
technically true, as the dealing was controlled by subgroups. Somewhere al=
ong
the supply line there must have been a connection, as identical drugs were
sold in both Protestant and Catholic clubs.

Paradoxically, the innocent, peaceful, joyous atmosphere was partly due to
paramilitary involvement, as all drugs sold were good quality and no one g=
ot
ripped off. And the paramilitaries only allowed speed, E and acid, unlike
England where coke, Ketamine and even crack is also sold in many clubs.
Violence was unknown on the Northern Irish rave scene. But ravers taking d=
rugs
had no choice but to provide funds for killing people, a responsibility th=
at
some felt revolted by, but most accepted as part of life.

A reader studying political factions in Northern Ireland told me that the
resulting breakdown in hard line sectarianism among the youth was a cause =
of
concern to the paramilitaries (see above), but there seemed to be no one
trying to stop kids making friends at raves. There was concern, though, th=
at
the paras were becoming more interested in the money for its own sake than=
 for
political ends. Two quite separate people seriously told me that the drugs
money provided the paras with new motives that they were unlikely to conce=
de
through peace.

Closing stuff,
    In Colorado parties can only be shut down if there are violations.  Not
enough port-o-lets or other health issues.  Fire hazards such as occupancy
issues.  Parties can't be shut down because of people dealing.  I guess out
here officials CAN shut down parties just because there are people
distributing?
    If I'm going to keep stuff out of my crew's party, I'll have to do such
an elaborate search of everyone on their way in that by the time we got
halfway through the line of people waiting to get in (those that didn't
leave at least) the party will be over.  Substances will still get in
meaning that someone will have to keep an eye out for that and escort those
people to the door, or our on-sight officer(s) to them.  This will make for
a relatively drug free party.  --You should have read the reviews of the
party we threw and did this at.  This is what sparked our education
standpoint and made us realize that the sense of control we had was entirely
false.  Most of the policeman at most of the parties in Colorado only make
arrests if they have to.  If Officer White overhears or catches wind of a
drug deal being made, he'll make an arrest.  Otherwise he'll take the
standpoint that most of the cops do.  Let it go.  Most officers just want to
make sure the party doesn't go bad.  Make sure no one gets mauled for
wearing the same Adidas jacket as someone else, make sure the vibe doesn't
go bad and the event turn into a riot of sorts.  Cops realize that for most
people, the drug culture is something they dip into.  There's a time and
place for everything right?  Sometimes it's not just college.  "A citizen
may mess around with these things for a while...","...but eventually most of
those people get burnt out on this and return to a drug free lifestyles."
Now granted this is only the perspective of SOME of the officers that come
to keep an eye on our parties.
    If people are selling enough G to someone to kill them.  They need to
pay the consequences for that.  Same with any drug.  Different production
crews take different standpoints on drugs at their parties.  Different
production crews take different actions to prevent OD's or negative
experiences from happening.  All I can say is that with our standpoint, we
never had an OD at any of our parties.  That's what I like to see.  Life.
Happiness.  Good Vibes.
    How's this.  PLURR  Peace, Love, Unity, Respect, RESPONSIBILITY.  Lets
all have fun SAFELY!  Look out for your brothers/sisters.  We're all in this
world together.  Lets show it.

Later,
--j

According to the Urban Legends Homepage, this is indeed and urban
legend.  It may have happened once or twice way back when (which is
how a lot of these thing get started), but it's nothing to live in
fear about.  As far as the site could find -- there haven't even been
any reported cases of this ever having happened.

Just more false information fed to children by DARE officers...

and speaking of dare, I think the best and most humurous testament to
it's stunning ineffectiveness is that every single person I know who got
a dare-bear (a reward to two students in each class) turned into a
serious pot-head.  I try not to think about the money flushed down the
toilet on the war on drugs each year...

For those of you in the pgh area who want to see modulations, the film
on electronic music culture by iara lee, it'll be brought to pittsburgh
by the wonderful institution that is Pittsburgh Filmmakers starting
mid-December.  It's only a 4 or so day run, so look out for it.  I
believe the dates are dec 11-14 but I'm not entirely sure.  It's gonna
be at the melwood screening room, my second favorite place here to see a
movie, so go see it.

Yeah not to do doubt anybody one this list, but for the 8-10 people that i
remember seeing at SCJ on a regular basis, they are the only people that
actually were there. Saying that youd make it out, would be great, but that
wouldn't help anything out because who would really be there the next time,
and so on....

If you went to Continuum, your lucky, i wanted to go to it but i didn't 
have any money, so my sister and hers+my friends all went cause they 
knew i couldn't go, if you went and see a kid w/ short blond hair
and little glowing red fingers dancing, look for the girl w/ reddish 
hair probably rolling by him who's not dancing and call her a bitch for 
me, thanx

P.S. for the ppl that did go, was it good??

personally i like smoke machines AND cigarettes.

i did a little half assed calculating about second hand smoke at raves 
killing you and here are the findings... 

if you stated going to raves at age 10 and went to 2 a week and stayed 
for 12 hours you would die of second hand smoke at the age of 861.

now on the other hand if you went to a raves twice a week from the age 
of 10 and drove home slightly buzzed or  tired from dancing or tripping 
all night and fell asleep at the wheel you would die in 2.374 years or 
at the age of 12.374.    

SO WHAT THIS PROVES IS we should be able to smoke at raves and 12 yr 
olds shouln't be driving.

I think that's the way its supposed to work.  Subliminal cues within the
war on drugs to keep the "War on Drugs" [TM] going.

Speaking of wasted money, i have to recommend a book i picked up the other
day, "Take the Rich off Welfare" (by Mark Zepezauser & Arthur Naiman - $9
paperback odonian press)  Its really a really clear, logical, factual,
methodical look at how the rich are constantly fucking over everyone else
and making it seem like its our own fault.  I don't recommend alot of
books, but i recommend this.

yea, but it seems more likely that someone on ghb
would be in need of an ambulance than someone on
speed.  the speed freaks would be chasing the
ambulance down the street, not passed out in a
coma.

well its really a matter of complicated biochemistry but here it is in a
nutshell

e reduces your seretonin level by using it all up in a relatively short
period of time.  
turkey contains a chemical (amino acid l-tryptophan) that's metabolized by
your body into seretonin.
drugs like zoloft, prozac and paxil make seretonin last longer.

so really the turkey would give you more seretonin to be used by the e,
making your roll better
(at least in theory, i never tried it though)

if you want more detailed descriptions of how it all happens let me know =)

-dan 
(those 6 years of alt.drugs and alt.drugs.chemistry and my psych classes
finally paid off)

flip, flip, flip]

Alma awoke and knew something had gone terribly wrong.  The high-pitched
squeal and red and green lights blinking in an alternating pattern signaled
trouble.  He wanted to immediately turn it off and go back to his previous
state of serenity.  He could feel the cold air touching his skin, this sent
a shiver throughout his whole body, this was the awakening.

Kept in a cryogenic chamber for over 2 years in a secret and private
underground laboratory, this member of a group known as the Sunshine Kids,
was their leader and founder and incidentally the one who would be first
awakened if anything had happened to go wrong.  The purpose of the
cryogenic devices was to channel the cumulative life force, or vibe, as
they preferred to call it in preparation for the new millennium.  With the
help of the technicians Moroni and Ether, they planned on using the stored
vibes to create the strongest blast of life force in conjunction with that
of over a thousand ravers to bring in the next century.

Alma stretched and climbed out of the chamber that was his home for so
long.  He quickly showered, dressed, gushed down the vitamin-fortified
drink that would help his body return to active life.  He sat down in front
of the main console and hit the reset button.  A brief silence and then a
beep, the flashing lights and siren continued.  Alma then knew he could not
do this alone.

Alma activated the waking mechanism of the other chambers.

"Oh doggy!" exclaimed Moroni.

"Are we there yet?" laughed Ether in a child-like voice.

"No," said Alma, "The troubleshooting programmed activated my awakening.  I
tried the reset mechanism, but alas nothing.  I am going to need your help
getting things back on track."

"Well, what time is it?" questioned Moroni.

"It is November 28, 1998.  Approximately one year and one month before our
scheduled arrival." sighed Alma.

"Oh, I guess we aren't there yet." said Ether.

Ether and Moroni proceed to shower, dress and devour the fluids that would
return them to full walking energy. Afterwards Moroni activated the main
console control and started to punch up the diagram showing the status of
the project.  For the first half hour he quickly shifted by the daily
reports checking for inconstancies, power interruptions, anything.  Then
finally he stopped punching and turned back to the others.

"It's Little Red Raver Hood. She's, um, she's been lost!" exclaimed Moroni.


"Lost?!" cried Ether "You mean dead, she's gone. Something very horrible
must have happened."

"We needed her." Alma added.

"She is gone yes, now.  Dead, well yes.  There is still something we can
do." said Moroni.  "You see before we went into our chambers I made sure
that the others who were not joining us in the sleep would have a link to
the life-force mechanism.  They all had implanted in them a transceiver,
which was incidentally the way the main computer was able to detect Red's
absence.  The transceiver is an unbreakable link to that persons own
life-force and our own cumulative stored energies here."

"Sooooooo..?" quizzed Ether.

"So, if we channel the stored life-force back to her transceiver, just
maybe we can, well, reactive her."

"But if we use all the stored energy, the mission, the project will have
failed.  We will have nothing for the dawn of the new century." Ether said.

"Without Red," Alma stated "The project will be meaningless, futile.  All
of this, the underground laboratory, the chambers, the stored vibe, it will
have meant nothing.  Even if we don't have full power there is no chance of
bringing in the good groovy vibe to the millennium without Little Red.
Most of all Red is one of us, and we can not just let her go."

"Yes, I don't know what I was thinking.  I love Red just as much as all of
you and we must do whatever we can to bring her back." Ether said.

"Ok, this will not be quick and not be easy.  This is not some form of
magick, this is not an illusion. You must listen to me and believe." said
Moroni.  "Since we have lost her and can not locate her transceiver we must
do this the old fashioned way."

Moroni turned to an array of blinking machines on the side of the wall.  He
had to blow the dust away to even see what he was dealing with.  The first
one had the numbers 303.  He went on to the next it said 707, and the next
which was 909.  He sighed.

"Looking for this?" smartly quipped Ether as she raised her flashlight to a
deck at the top of the console which had a large dial and the words
"Quondam Beats" etched into the faceplate.

so if you want some info on GHB, go to:

lycaeum is a generally good site for drug info... i'm pretty sure it
is the most up to date and well laid out on the web.

i'm just glad g isn't a large issue in the scene around here.

hey...

all this talk of DARE jogged my memory on a humorous tidbit:

you know that dj ho that was the #1 topic of conversation on the list
a couple of weeks ago? the one that was all over osheen? i used to go
to school with her (from like 5-8th grade) and she used to be the
president of DARE in her old school. a role model to her peers no
doubt :) needless to say that aint the case no mo.

on another interesting note, did anyone notice the striking similarity
between DJ SINE (the real dj sine, not the imposter guy) and CONAN
O'BRIAN? i'm pretty sure the only difference is the hair... and andy
is funnier. seriously, tho - stay up late tonite... you'll swear they
are related.

well, if you consider it in terms of supply and demand, yes, it was
caused by atomic and on. if there's only 1 clubnight (which scj was for
most of last spring) that's the one that people are going to go to. if
they have choices, they will choose among them, going to the one that
they like best.
I think the death of scj reflects the presence of other club nights, but
also the fact that a lot of people don't like jungle enough to go to an
all jungle night... (I love jungle, but I like other types of music
too...)
the other problem was that this was kind of a self fulfilling prophesy-
no one goes to scj so kids are like "hm, no one is going to go, so I'll
just go to atomic, which will have a lot of people"
anyway, it was a lot of good memories

I wanted to jot this off before falling asleep -- or waking up.  Lou and
the boys at Shortarm out did themselves once again.  Just when you thought
the music at a party couldn't get any better . . . well, just inject
Claude Young into the mix and you'll see what happens.  All I can say is,
in terms of Thanksgiving, a big part of my dinner plate of gratitude goes
to the excellent music we've been privileged to during the past year.  And
Shortarm has been a major part of this.  A MAJOR part!

Thanks and keep up the fantastic work!

hah. i wish i wouldve stayed home. can someone please tell me when Shortarm
turned into Teknova? because as far as i can tell, theyre now exactly the same
in the way they throw parties... fuckin dark as hell space, dark music, and
freaky ass kids walking around. the three things that i hate most about a
party. there werent the usual smiling faces. there were about 40 kids walking
around going, "wow this is my first party" and being completely fucked up
outta their mind. by one o'clock i saw so many people stumbling around i was
thoroughly disgusted and ready to leave. im not trying to dis shortarm or
teknova exactly, because theyve both thrown a party or two that i had fun at,
but this dark stuff, well i could do without it. im sorry, but i just cant get
in the mood to dance and have fun when all i see are a bunch of freaked out
looking kids that have never rolled before and decided to pop 4 of them at
once. (i heard so many kids say shit like that throughout the night). maybe
its just me, but i need something other than a loud, creepy baseline to make
me want to dance and put me in a good mood so that i can walk around and meet
people and just have an overall fun time. but i saw none of this here. some of
you have said you hate how kids will just walk around and socialize, and
ignore the music.. but when the music isnt too hot, thats the only thing that
i can really do to pass the time and hope a better dj comes on next.. but no
one even seemed approachable.. and who wants to attempt a conversation with
really fucked up kids that have never been to a party before? especially when
yer probably the most sober person there? ugh. i hate this scene more and more
every party.

in reference to the dark/rave/techno complaint...

techno is mean.  techno is dark.  the environment should be mean and dark. 
techno is machine.  think of machines, the machine [that we are in, both
politically and biologically] when you dance to techno.  it is the element
that puts us in the same category.  it is why we are temporarily unison. 
it is a celebration and exaggeration of process.

corporate welfare is probably the one government policy that is even
more fucked up than the war on drugs.  Is everyone familiar w/ Michael
Moore?  if not you _must_ check something of his out.  he's a
proletariat-type who does incredibly smart, funny, and biting political
and social satire.  He did a show caleed TV Nation that remains either
my fav or second fav show (Twin Peaks rocks too,).  He's also done two
films, Roger & Me (Roger referring to the CEO of GM, a company that has
probably screwed more Americans than anyone else) and this years' The
Big One (not as good but still has important things to say).  His book,
Downsize This is also really good.  I hear he has a new show in
producion for Showtime...I can't wait:)

i can tell you from personal experience that its very easy to overdo it wit=
h
ghb.  if you treat it with care its great, but its next to impossible to
find a sutiable dosage without knocking yourself out, which is a pretty
damn scary experience.  its definately something we don't need in the
scene for this simple reason.

erica i hope you don't mind if i attempt to add something here ... don't you
mean other all-ages club nights?  (or eighteen and over - whatever hairy stuff
the lcb is pushing)

many of pittsburgh's finest can be heard on a weekly basis at other places
like soba, the pollinator, zythos, sip, and ahem a couple unmentionable new
venues which make me question the limits of taste but anyways 7up, zemo, josh
ryan, instigator (has everyone forgotten about him?), product 19, dj spike
(did anyone ever know about him?), dust, kevin, smoov, ruffian, tim+ted zelch
... actually i don't know if smoov and ruffian are still doing their wednesday
thing at zythos.  and whatever happened to soji + the 168 gang?  i know some
are still around.  (that was when i just went to the parties.)  (i didn't care
about who's who.)  (something i'm considering doing again.)  (but i know it's
not gonna haapen.)

mskw1 served up a tasty set at sip on friday night.  sssip=yummm

well, if you consider it in terms of supply and demand, yes, it was
caused by atomic and on. if there's only 1 clubnight (which scj was for
most of last spring) that's the one that people are going to go to. if
they have choices, they will choose among them, going to the one that
they like best.
I think the death of scj reflects the presence of other club nights, but
also the fact that a lot of people don't like jungle enough to go to an
all jungle night... (I love jungle, but I like other types of music
too...)
the other problem was that this was kind of a self fulfilling prophesy-
no one goes to scj so kids are like "hm, no one is going to go, so I'll
just go to atomic, which will have a lot of people"
anyway, it was a lot of good memories

hello friends and family of nightlife in pennsylvania.  ever since i moved
back to pittsburgh from new york, the city that never sleeps, i've been
considering adopting a project which deals with the pennsylvania liquor
control board's conscientous application of restrictions on our funtime.  

i'm unabashedly stating my intentions before i begin to bite off perhaps more
than i can chew because i'm going to need support from others who might share
a similar interest, even if it's a quick yes/no reply of whether any effort
could possibly be fruitful.

[so i tried to avoid mission-statement-type language when i wrote this note
but at this point it got a litlle out of hand ... sorry]

it is my belief that the current legislations as you and i know them are
outdated, inefficeint, and self-defeating.  to this end, i want ...

1 - to research the (history of) regulations regarding nightlife issues and
the mechanisms/people through which they have evolved
2 - to promote a spurt in that evolution
3 - to find loopholes!!!

i take my parties seriously.  that's all i can say right now.

also i am having an existentialist debate with myself about whether these
issues are something that deserves such an effort.  like, why don't i apply my
efforts to social injustice, animal rights, or the environment?  

that means i need to know if i should bother with this at all.

i lost all social consciousness recently. you have a better chance at changing
things through throwing bomb parties. people refuse to be herded by anyone except
the state. plus, everything youll ever read is propaganda of some sort. i just
decided i was above all of this. the groups i concerned myself with all became too
argumentative. i got tired of my favorite "food not bombs" when some newer members
recently began plotting the boycott of the "meat culture". as far as i can tell,
95% or so of the world's populations either eats meat, or would eat meat if they
could find/afford it. so that makes vegetarians the minority. thus i believe in
"real life" and the "vegetarian culture". ive also noticed that non-religious
self-imposed vegetarianism is only found in rich industrialized nations. so ive
concluded that vegetarianism is a bourgoise idea for people who wish to fool
themselves and others into thinking that theryre a more morally correct person
than everyone else by developing a holier-than-thou attitude. plus, its obvious
that vegetarians are stupid, cuz gyros are bomb. so are buffalo wings. i regret
ever having been vegan.

Swiss Voters Block Bid To Legalize Narcotics

By Michael Shields

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss voters Sunday rejected by a thumping
three-to-one margin a sweeping proposal to legalize
narcotics that backers said would eliminate the drugs mafia but critics
said would make Switzerland a drugs haven.

The plan would have made Switzerland the only country in the world where
anyone aged 18 or older could buy narcotics of
their choice, from marijuana to heroin, from state-run outlets or
pharmacies after consulting a physician.

With 22 of 26 cantons (states) reporting, the measure had not carried a
single canton and had garnered the support of only
26.8 percent of votes counted so far.

The proposal had been widely expected to fail, but the drubbing that
voters administered at the polls disappointed organizers
who were hoping a sizeable minority would support making liberal Swiss
drugs policy even more tolerant.

``I am very disappointed. We had expected a much better result,'' said
Francois Reusser, co-organizer of the committee that
collected enough signatures to trigger the referendum under the Swiss
system of direct democracy.

``We were unable to mobilize a wide range of (drugs) consumers
themselves, the dope-smokers and ravers, or there would
have been a different outcome,'' he told Reuters.

He said he hoped government officials would still move to liberalize the
possession and use of soft drugs like marijuana, adding
he was ready to launch a fresh initiative if need be.

``We will keep the pressure on for this, of course,'' he said.

Thomas Zeltner, director of the Federal Health Bureau in Berne, saw the
vote as popular confirmation of Switzerland's policy
of combating the drugs trade but helping the most severe drug addicts.

But he said Berne was ready to take a fresh look at how to treat soft
drugs like marijuana and hashish.

``We have to continue the discussion about the legalization of cannabis.
There is now such a big gap between the legal
regulation of cannabis and reality that we need to act,'' he said,
adding draft legislation due next year would address this.

The Swiss government and other opponents had called the initiative an
extreme measure that would fuel addiction and isolate
Switzerland from international police and justice cooperation.

But backers said drugs prohibition had failed to stop the supply,
instead creating a black market with no health standards and
high prices that forced addicts into theft or prostitution to fund their
habit.

Launched by a committee of drugs experts, doctors and lawyers, the
referendum proposal was backed by leftist politicians and
youth chapters of two of three conservative parties in the Swiss
government center-right coalition.

A noble deed indeed.  Now i see what you were talking about before.
IMHO, this is something that is really absurd, and infringes on our
freedom in an unnessicary way.  But most people don't fight it because it
seems like a superficial cause.   I'm not sure how to tackle this problem,
but i'll help you if i can.

Right on.  Sounds like a good general idea.  I think once we have the
specific legislation in hand, at least we'll have a better understanging
of how hard it would be to change it. 

I'm thinking of things like:

- Licensing of venues, especially pertaining to allowing/disallowing
people of certain ages to be on the premises, especially in conjunction
with alcohol.

- How late venues are permitted to be open on any particular night.

there's more specifics i'm sure.
lemme know what your thinking about.

I hope you regret sending this post, too.  I don't know if you were just
trying to be funny, but this was one of the most ignorant things I have
ever read.  I am a vegetarian for many reasons, and not one of them is
because it makes me feel morally superior to ANYONE.  Although morals were
the biggest factor for me becoming vegetarian, the issue of cruelty to
animals/animal rights,they were MY OWN morals (and also non-religious and
self-imposed), not to make me a better person but to make me be the best me
I can be, not to impose on anyone else, and certainly not to make me feel
that I am in any way morally superior to ANYONE.  Who am I to tell anyone
what they should or shouldn't do?  At one time the majority of people
thought that slavery and denying other humans rights was acceptable, and it
was the minority who believed otherwise.  Does majority opinion always make
something right?  Ravers, like vegetarians, definitely represent a minority
of the population, but that doesn't make what we stand for any less
relevant or important.  Within any group, you're going to find people doing
things for a wide variety of reasons.  To say that vegetarians are only
people who do it to feel morally superior is like saying there is only one
right reason for coming to raves, but then you say that too, don't you?  I
am a vegetarian because I am against cruelty to any form of life; because
many of the world's environmental problems could be solved by eliminating
(or reducing) eating meat; because many of the world's hunger problems
could be eliminated by the elimination or reduction of eating meat; because
there are so many health benefits to being vegetarian; and many other
reasons that I won't waste your time listing here (many can be found at
www.envirolink.org/arrs/essays (I recommend "Realities") or e-mail me).  I
realize that I cannot change the world, but I can do the best I can to make
it the best place I know how.  I do not belong to any animal
rights/vegetarian groups, although I do believe in a lot of their causes.
I merely believe that vegetarianism is right for me.  How dare you accuse
me of being holier-than-thou.  If eating meat makes you happy, then eat
meat, just please don't call me stupid for choosing not to.  plur, dan

hey...

there is an article about SCJ-dissolution  on the front page of ravedata.
i think we have all read it, but it is neat to see it there (novelty,
different font, etc.).  a member of the ravedata team added my phorm
review to the phorm phile...i knew that review was special, it was from my
heart, right down to the inadvertant percentage symbol in the subject
field.  also, i had a dream last night that the red exit signs in my
dormitory were all melting.  when you walk under them normally they
project red beams onto your skin (i dont know what type of lighting they
use).  however, in the dream, they were dripping like lava...very slowly.
the point of the dream is that i didn't want the fire annunciator to
activate...horrifying <deep sigh, glad it is all over>.

                                             

Andy

>  i hate this scene more and more every party. 

perhaps you haven't noticed before due to some sort of drug induced haze, but
all of our events have been like continuum in regards to atmosphere, crowd,
and most of all, music.  

in regards to atmosphere, darkness generally leads people to feel less
inhibited, which is generally good at a party, because more people dance if
they feel not everyone is watching them.  also, i knew how the music was going
to be, and i created an environment suitable for listening to such music.

in regards to crowd, i don't think you have any more right to go to a party
than anyone else, no matter how fucking big your pants are, or how many candy
necklaces you own.  if you had any idea about what the "scene" is about, you
wouldn't really care who showed up.  there were "non-ravers" at this event
because it was advertised outside of a rave.  that is because i do stuff other
than "rave".  there were alot of "industrial/goth" kids there, because i enjoy
that music myself, and have many friends who live that lifestyle over the
blowpop/kik-wear lifestyle of a raver.

in regards to the music, there was an overwhelming amount of techno at this
party, because as far as "rave" music goes, techno is what i prefer.  in the
midwest, ohio in particular, there is a severe lack of representation of this
genre, so i took it upon myself to makeup for it in one night.  perhaps if you
don't like techno, then you should read the flyer and see what it says
underneath the dj's names.  you don't have to like it, but it doesn't hurt to
know a bit about it.  i'm sure you'll hear plenty of speed garage at the next
party you go to, so instead of dancing to a "dark and creepy bassline", you
can dance to a funky and happy one then.

rave on,
lou

Right on Lou........Lou knows whats up......when it comes to thee ohio scene
and taste in music Lou is right up there on thee top ov thee list.  His
background in knowledge ov thee electronic music genre goes way past silly
stuff like Dj Funk (poop on him).  Lou is a very intelligent person and like
me prefers thee more intelligent side ov thee electronic/rave genre.  Lou is
thee mastermind behind all these events and puts alot ov hard work and effort
into what he does......I am very proud to promote, support, and be a part ov
thee Shortarm extended family.  Lou has brought alot ov talent to Ohio, and I
give him great respect for that and all thee other great things he has done
for thee scene.  I am sorry if some people don't take their music as seriously
as thee likes ov Lou and I.  In my opinion all ov thee music I have been
hearing spun lately is becoming very silly and trendy.......I mean booty
house... gimmie a break.  And this Jungle craze that is goin on is
outrageous.....what ever happened to good intelligent drum'n'bass.  People
seem to be afraid to try new things NE-more, to experiment, to use thee
undescribable emotions that lie inside ov each ov us to create new sounds,
images, and emotions.  How do you think this genre ov music was created in
thee first place.......by pioneers such as Cevin Key, Dwayne Goetell (R.I.P),
Bill Leeb, Richard D. James, Richie Hawtin, Mike Paridinas, and Genisis P.
Orridge.  These men paved thee way for a whole new genre ov music by taking
their emotions that could not be described with words and describing them with
never before heard sounds.  My point is people should have open minds when it
comes to music, and should be open to moving forward when it comes to thee
scene and its music.  I am sorry to say it but thee scene seems to be stuck in
a rut and Lou is doing a pretty damn good job ov livening things up.  If  it
wasnt for Lou and his dedication to thee scene and thee music thee Ohio scene
wouldnt be where it is today......I mean hes been doing this for One year and
in that time has brought some ov thee greatest most amazing intelligent music
to little old Ohio.  And as far as his live project Circuitry
goes.....amazing, and very intelligent.......gets better and better everytime
I hear it.  This kid is gonna go far and I am proud to say I was there
supporting, and promoting Shortarm and their cause since thee begining.  I am
proud ov you lou and thank you for letting me be a part ov it all.  Madd Props
go out to Circuitry, Wuby (that last track blew me away), and Swin for
representing new and live original music......I hope maybe this will inspire
more people to invest in gear instead ov tables......I mean i have much more
respect for someone who can create a new and intresting track than for people
who have a big record collection and can match a beat......No offense to NE
dj's out there cause some ov you have great taste in music and really know how
to mix it up........
Well Happy Birthday and long live Shortarm
Love<<<<<<Avant>>>>>>>Peace

its pretty much impossible to live up to the images of some of these
artists and still be within the 'techno' genre, since they are so
definitive (many names go unmentioned, but you know who they are)

the 'techno' scene - which rarely takes form except @ raves has only so
much tolerance for mutation - there's a point where it just leaves the
realm of 'techno' and is something else.  the way 'techno' is made today,
is through manipulating sounds that are already within the repotoire of
accepted sounds, or adding similar but new sounds to an old musical
formula.  if it doesn't 'flow' like techno, then its just some crazy

i don't claim to be *the* expert on all forms of techno and rave music,
but i've got opinions.  the only places i hear truely amazing things are
within the genres a noiscore and drum + bass.  artists like andy c,
dillinga, optical, ez rollers, and peshay just to name a few have come up
with some amazing stuff in the past couple years.  drum + bass is really
the only musical style i know that can push its boundaries so much and
still remain a style, and for that (plus the slammin' tunes), i stick with
it.  noisecore is more far out, but the stuff is some of
the only music i really consider mindbending anymore - memetic,
noisecreaker, uk skullfuck, dj freak - harsh, psychedelic noise that
expresses emotions you can't even imagine.  i'm also pretty impressed with
alot of downtempo/illbient stuff, but i don't know the artists well enough
to comment much.

other than that, and a bit of european techno here and there, there isn't
much that moves me in a way that i've never been moved before.
 
now still that's not to say i don't have fun hearing some diva house,
or acid trance or oldskool or whatever.  but i definitely am more into
pushin' it. (the boundaries) and i wish more people would book stuff like
that.  I've never been to one of lou's events (wait were you involved with
subphunc??), but i gotta give him props for booking live acts, and pushin'
things as much as he can.  (same goes to the elemental crew, dropbass, and
whoever else is willing to go the extra mile)

> silly

sorry? dj funk is silly? perhaps, but a whole lot of good techno is
downright silly and anyway, who are you to judge? clearly you've never
heard (or noticed) any of his tracky stuff, which is quite hard and
bleepy. solid.

> I am sorry if some people don't take their music as seriously
> as thee likes ov Lou and I
um, don't be pretentious. 
do ravers have to be serious? does good techno have to be _serious_?

what the fuck ever. I have just as much right to call psychic tv silly
(which I think it is, along with their *misspelling* thing.) there have
always been some electronic crossovers, witness deelite, kraftwerk, etc.
 
>  And this Jungle craze that is goin on is
> outrageous.....what ever happened to good intelligent drum'n'bass
jungle and drum and bass are the same damn thing (<- possible start of a
flamewar, I know =) anyway, if you're thinking of illbient, it's
generally not something that gets the party thumping and is generally
true of most intelligent/head music. remember, raves are generally
*dance* parties.

> I hope maybe this will inspire

much >more respect for someone who can create a new and intresting track
than >for people who have a big record collection and can match a beat
both are necessary components of the scene. you clearly have no idea how
difficult it is to do a quality mix. probably you don't dj, so you can't
tell until a dj is fucking up hard core, but it is tough to consistantly
carry a strong set. I have only heard a few djs that have impressed me
with the quality of their mixing (although there are many that have a
superior track selection and average mixing skills.) As I have learned
to dj, I have realized more and more that there are many who can _mix_
the music, but few who can truly _dj_.

hey, the "vegetarians are stupid" comment was a joke. the rest was a long thought
out opinion on vegetarianism. how many vegetarians do you think there are in
ethiopia? prolly not many. what im saying here is that vegetarianism is basically
only present in rich industrialized nations. that says something about it.

i agree wholeheartedly with this. people really should read the flyer before going
to a rave. i cant understand blindly exposing yourself to the possibility of
"house music" or "gabber". :) im just saying that people should know what theyre
getting into. id also like to point out that aside from hardcore and jungle (in a
league of their own), techno is definitely the supreme form of rave music.

id have to agree that jungle has the most possibilities. only two things are
constant, the drums, and the bass. everything else is completely free for the
artist to put in. obviously, there are trends in jungle, but that still doesnt stop
it from morphing. its by far the most variant form of electronic music.

in response to lou's post...

<<perhaps you haven't noticed before due to some sort of drug induced haze,
but all of our events have been like continuum in regards to atmosphere,
crowd, and most of all, music.  >>

um.. well thanks for stereotyping me as one of your "usual" party-goers, but i
was completely sober at your party... maybe ive just been to so many similar
parties lately that i havent been impressed with that i cant tell one from the
other.

<<in regards to crowd, i don't think you have any more right to go to a party
than anyone else, no matter how fucking big your pants are, or how many candy
necklaces you own. >>

i never said i had any more right to be there than anyone else. my pants arent
any bigger than average pants, and i wasnt wearing any candy necklaces, thank
you.

<< if you had any idea about what the "scene" is about, you wouldn't really
care who showed up.>>

i dont care who goes to these parties, but i know that certain people can make
me feel uncomfortable. when people that i hear about are there that are only
there to rip people off and steal from kids, that sort of thing, then i dont
feel safe, and i cant have a good time.

<< because i enjoy that music myself, and have many friends who live that
lifestyle over the blowpop/kik-wear lifestyle of a raver.>>

i have *plenty* of musical interests that dont have anything to do with techno
or jungle or anything associated with the rave scene, that i have been
listening to long before i even knew this scene existed. im not saying its bad
to have other interests, because that limits people and id hope people have
things outside of the scene to take part in.. if you didnt, thatd be pretty
sad. and again, i dont own any kik-wears. but i have been known to eat a blow-
pop here and there... however, i dont think my preference in candy choices
makes me a typical candy raver or had any impact on my party experience.

<<perhaps if you don't like techno, then you should read the flyer and see
what it says underneath the dj's names.  you don't have to like it, but it
doesn't hurt to know a bit about it. >> 

i read. thanks. and i consider myself open to all sorts of music and learning
about types i havent heard before.. but i know what i like and i dont when i
hear it. and i wasnt into it. sorry. <shrug>

<< i'm sure you'll hear plenty of speed garage at the next party you go to, so
instead of dancing to a "dark and creepy bassline", you can dance to a funky
and happy one then.>>

well, i hope i dont hear speed garage at the next party i go to, because thats
not my thing either. if it was, i mightve been out there dancing to 7-up. but
as far as the funky happy music, i look forward to it.

my "review", if thats what you want to call it, wasnt supposed to be a
personal attack on this party.. just my general distaste for the past few
parties ive been to, all by different people. i wasnt trying to offend anyone,
just speak my mind. i guess im not allowed to do that tho without people
getting defensive and launching personal attacks. oh well. take care all.

thanks, but there are alot of other people you should being giving credit to
long before me.  

in response to someone's (geoff's i believe) reply about other forms of music
pushing the boundries far more than techno, i completely agree.  ambient and
soundscape music has been and will always be my first love (coil/old aphex
twin)  i also have been getting into a little experimental drum n bass
(photek) and just plain experimental (autechre, another current fav. of mine).
outside of parties, i rarely listen to any techno at all.  i think that right
now, there is very little left that one can really do with the usual "techno
formula".  continuum was my attempt at giving credit to those who in my
opinion have helped shaped (ie claude/damon) and who have reshaped (adam/joel)
that formula best.  in order for me to give credit to all of those who have
attributed to techno, i would be throwing parties forever, but since i really
don't plan on that, i have selected a small few who i believe have done the
most (ie juan atkins/derrick may in the past).  after the marco carola  party
i'm doing on dec. 18th, i really don't intend on doing the same kind of
events.

THANK YOU FOR VOICING THIS! :)  Ok so maybe the dust in the paintball
arena is a bit much and even millvale is rough but this really is
true. Unfortunately we are not in an area where we can throw parties
outside like out west moreso but dirty comes with the party. If you
have seen my torn jean pants then you know what im talking about. I
view raves as the warfare in the urban jungle of society. There will
be causulties and we will get our hands dirty, but we will win.

hey, i got a dare-bear! and i only Write like a pot-head.
though seriously, before DARE i thought drugs were frightening and useless,
but after researching the effects of hallucinogens and stimulants in school,
i found there were many new things i wanted to try..
i wouldn't find point in doing drugs at raves though,
easier to get empathically high off the vibes of the other dancers
trippers and the music itself. others sometimes assume that i'm on e but
i'm really not i just like smiling and hugging people

tom cox asked:
>how many vegetarians do you think there are in ethiopia? 
>prolly not many. 

umm, Most of them are vegetarian, last i checked.
do you realize how Expensive meat is compared to grains and vegetables?
research how much it costs, in terms of resources and labor,
to produce meat vs to produce vegetation.
it's much cheaper to eat the grains directly than to 
feed them to cows, then have to go to all the trouble of properly
killing preparing and processing them.
you can feed 10 vegetarians on the resources needed to feed
a regular meat eater.

>what im saying here is that vegetarianism is 
>basically only present in rich industrialized nations. 
>that says something about it.

no, it's only in rich industrialized nations that meat is demanded on
such a large scale that it's cheap, while some grains are overprocessed 
and sold at ridiculously inflated prices, and ships of grain get
dumped literally into the ocean to keep those prices artificially high.
only in America can you get a Big Mac cheaper than a loaf of bread.
(though buying grains in bulk is still the cheapest way to live)
the idea of eating meat at every meal is only present in 
rich industrialized nations. 
now, only in rich industrialized nation do you have this sense of
vegetarianism being a Choice which is somehow Morally superior.
and because capitalism has made junk food so cheap here,
while 'health' food is expensive, 
then veganism is not the easiest option for our poor,
but again that's because of what it costs to Buy food,
not what it costs to produce it.
in poor nations it's just taken for granted that meat is an
expensive item to be eaten only on special occasions,
i don't think they think of themselves as 'morally superior',
just practical. if you're buying grains and veggies from the source
instead of through stores, and preparing them yourself, 
it's more cost effective in this country as well, 
or so one worker at a soup kitchen for children
explained to me when asked why they only serve vegetarian meals
(the other main reason being because it's healthier).

Okay, I have a question.  I have an acquaintance who somehow got
Kenyon College to let him do his minor in "the history of electronic
music," (!) and he told me that historically, 'drum and bass' and
'jungle' have been very separate things.  Perhaps now the terms have
collided, but at least a couple years ago, they were different.  He
said jungle usually has breakbeats, while drum and bass doesn't have
to.  Apparently to complete his minor he made tapes classifying every
type of major genre, and many sub-genres, on them.  

Now, I'll admit -- I *suck* at figuring out genres, especially now
that I've found out the music I listen to can't really be classified.  

And, could someone please tell me what genre Daft Punk is in?  Since
the music is entirely composed of mostly drums and a bassline -- could
this be considered drum and bass?  Or does that have *nothing* to do
with that particular genre classification criteria?    

--Amanda

how do you get all your vitamins? I like the color green as much as the next guy
but. meat is part of a healthy balanced diet like it or not.. Plus think about
it.. we are at the top of the food chain .. that means we can eat anything
underneath us.. like chickens, sharks, cows, elephants.. cute baby panda bears..
When a chicken gets smart enough to capture a human and then eat him .. then
perhaps we are not at the top of the food chain .. I will accept that.. :)

hey

do your research. no one needs meat to live. there are plenty of other foods
and supplements that can supply you with the vitamins you need. i have been a
vegetarian for almost 12 years and i am very healthy. i think that those who
think that meat is a necessary part of a healthy diet are just misinformed. i
am not telling you to be a vegetarian, if you like meat and have no problem
eating a dead animal, then go for it. i, on the other hand, can't do that and
feel good, or healthy for that matter. 

 and as far as being top of the food chain, yes we are, but that doesn't mean
that we should necessarily be hostile to those below us. using that as
justification for eating meat, to me, is weak. if you like it, that's one
thing. why don't you try to see things from another perspective?  even if you
don't agree, it may help you to be a little more open minded on the subject...

i am sorry if i have offended anyone with these posts, i myself am a little
biased on this subject. i just can't stand when people knock other people for
having a different lifestyle. i became a vegetarian when i was nine, and i
took slack for the better part of my life from people because of it. that's
why i feel the need to respond on this topic. no one has to listen to me, but
don't put me, or any of the other vegetarians down because of your opinions. i
don't write to the list saying "all meat eaters must die!!!" so don't make us
feel like we don't have the right to our own choices. have a wonderful day
everyone :)

in my opinion, one should not be so concerned with labels and just listen
and enjoy.  i think the more music you listen to, the more you'll figure
out your own genres.  then you can judge by what you know what sounds like
what.  just listen to a lot of different music and find what you like
basically.  outside of that it doesn't really matter :)

Oh, it's not like I really care all that much -- I suppose if I did, I
would just *know* these things and not have to ask.  But I am curious.
 I tell people that I like and dislike certain types of electronic
music, and I want to know that what I'm saying is right.  

You're right -- the more music one listens to, the easier it gets.  I
just feel like I should've figured this whole genre thing out long
ago, especially since I like music so much and used to be quite
involved in studying, playing, and creating it (years of piano and
clarinet).

no one needs it. but, seeing as i am a strong supporter of darwinism, i believe
that we have omnivorous teeth for a reason. nature doesnt do things blindly. maybe
not correctly, or nice, but still. there is a reason. im not gonna say that being
vegetarian is wrong, but i am saying that the reasons claimed by people for their
vegetarianism are their conscious reasons, and that perhaps there is an underlying
social problem that causes it to only be present in rich countries. perhaps guilt?
i dunno. im just saying that i think theres more than meets the eye.

This is not true.  both have breakbeats, both are the same.  for a
while it seemed as if people were starting to call more intelligent
jungle drum n bass, but not any more.

i dont know. i think the british press invented the term "drum and bass"
to describe ltj bukem's "intelligent" music. drum and bass still uses
breakbeats. anyway, i think people began to find "jungle" to be
offfensive.

and i think of daft punk  as being their own stuff. i classify them as
"electronic". you can tell a daft punk song when you hear one. same with
underworld, and the orbital.

Actually, meat is not part of a healthy balanced diet, unless you consider
heart disease, cancer, srokes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, not
to mention all of the dangerous pesticides and other chemicals you are
ingesting, healthy.  Not to mention all of the health benefits linked to a
vegetarian diet.
Here are the new four basic food groups suggested by the Physicians'
Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) in 1991 to replace the old one,
after finding the harmful effects of a meat-centered diet.  The May-June
1991 _PCRM Update_  explains, "On April 8, 1991, PCRM unveiled a proposal
to replace the Four Basic Food Groups.  The Four Food Groups have been part
of U.S. government recommendations since 1956, but promote dietary habits
which are largely responsible for the epidemics of heart disease, cancer,
stroke and other serious illnesses in this country.  The old four groups
were meat, dairy, grains and fruits/vegetables.  The 'New Four Food Groups'
are grains, legumes, vegetables and fruits.  Meat and dairy will lose their
food group status [by this proposal].  The 'New Four Food Groups'
represents a nutrition plan that is based on healthy, fiber-rich plant
foods rather than the former emphasis on cholesterol-and-fat-laden foods.
'The meat and dairy groups were the principal sources of cholesterol and
saturated fat, which is the biggest culprit in raising blood cholesterol,'
says PCRM Nutritionist Virginia Messina, M.P.H., R.D.  'These foods are
simply not necessary in the human diet.'"  PCRM poster offers the following
description of the four new food groups:

1. Whole Grains -- includes breads, pastas, rice, corn and all other
grains.  Note the emphasis on whole grains rather than refined grains.
Build each of your meals around a hearty grain dish--grains are rich in
fiber and other complex carbohydrates, as well as protein, B vitamins and
zinc.

2. Vegetables -- are packed with nutrients; they prvide vitamin C,
beta-carotene, riboflavin and other vitamins, iron, calcium, and fiber.
Dark green, leafy vegetables such as broccoli, collards, kale, mustard and
turnip greens, chicory or bok choy are especially good sources of these
important nutrients.  Dark yellow and orange vegetables such as carrots,
winter squash, sweet potatoes and pumpkin provide extra beta-carotene.
Include generous portions of a variety of vegetables in your diet.

3. Legumes -- which is another name for beans, peas, and lentils, are all
good sources of fiber, protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and B vitamins.  This
group also includes chickpeas, baked and refried beans, soy milk, tofu,
tempeh, and texturized vegetable protein.

4. Fruits -- are rich in fiber, vitamin C, and beta-carotene.  Be sure to
include at least one serving each day of fruits that are high in vitamin C
-- citrus fruits, melons, and strawberries are all good choices.  Choose
whole fruit over fruit juices, which don't contain as much healthy fiber.

As far as us being at the top of the food chain, as humans, unlike other
animals, we now have the understanding and ability to live a healthier,
more compassionate lifestyle without reducing ourselves to the unnecessary
slaughter of defenseless animals.  In fact, if you look at our physiology,
it can be argued that man was never originally suited for a carnivorous
diet, never meant to eat flesh.  But even if we are able to, I think we, or
at least many, have evolved beyond the food chain.  Although it is
necessary for other animals to sustain their diet by preying on other
animals, we as humans now have the understanding and ability to move beyond
that, and in doing so, live a healthier lifestyle, and also by doing so we
can eliminate many of the world's environmental problems (many of which are
caused by a meat-centered diet),  eliminate or greatly reduce world hunger,
as well as many other benefits from a vegetarian diet.  When you consider
all of those facts, why do you consider capturing and eating animals
"smart" rather than choosing not to?  I have done a lot of research on this
subject and can provide anyone with a lot of information about the benefits
of a vegetarian diet/ dangers of a meat-centered diet.  And before anyone
else responds with a post about how tasty meat is, I can assure you that
any  meat flavor you like, there are now many non-meat alternatives to
pretty much any meat you can think of that taste just as good or better.

If you were at Energize, or even if you weren't, you might enjoy this
article...

It's nice to see the media giving a party a review such as this.

Wait a minute.......granted I don't care who shows up, as long as those 
people have good intentions. My car was busted into (thank God nothing 
was stolen, but the kids parked next to me had their whole system ripped 
off) and the person who did it was wearing massive amounts of blue 
glitter. You and I both know that hardcore thieves don't normally wear 
that sort of stuff..so my conclusion would be that it was a party kid. I 
could've danced with this someone...talked...hung out with 
them...someone like me whom I thought I could identify with. Really? A 
party kid pried into my car. That depresses me. I won't let this ruin 
the scene for me...I'll just drive a different car when I go...but I 
don't think I would've gone if I knew it was advertised outside of 
flyers (I'll read more local 'zines now too). I don't want to hang out 
with shady kids. You know, the ones who are there to have a good time 
ripping people off.

i read your original post.
cigarettes are only easily available in rich industrialized nations.
so, only there can one make a conscious choice to smoke or not to smoke.
it is therefore elitist not to smoke cigarettes,
because in poorer nations they don't have a choice not to smoke;
if everyone in Ethiopia could afford a pack a day habit,
they would all smoke cigs too.
if we weren't intended to smoke a pack of cigarettes every day,
why would we have lungs?
nonsmokers must have problems with guilt.
i used to be into fighting for clean air, but
i stopped when the new kids there suggested quitting smoking.

i don't have a problem with people smoking or eating meat
if that is what they really want to do,
but to say i'm elitist not to want to spend money on either
carcinogenic substance is a bit much.

It's not insane, but it's not insane to not like cruelty and suffering,
either (I'm insane for different reasons ;)  ).  Tom, this is something I
100% agree with you about.  I don't enjoy cruelty and suffering, but it
doesn't make either one of us right.  Or wrong.  Just different.  Every
action we make is a choice.  Vegetarianism is certainly a choice I made.
One thing to remember though, is that every choice has consequences.  It is
a fact that eating meat causes death, and 99% of the time causes cruelty
and suffering.  If this is a consequence that you can live with, then eat
meat.  I'm not telling anyone what to do.  I'm just saying know the
consequences.  Please don't say that you eat meat because you can't have a
healthy diet without meat, because it's not true.  Please don't say that
you eat meat because that's the way your body is designed, because that's
not true either.  If you say you eat meat because it's something you enjoy
doing and you are aware that it causes pain and suffering and cruelty, you
are aware that the herding of cattle to support your meat habit is causing
massive destruction to the rain forests and the environment, and that you
are aware that it is a large cause of disease and many other health-related
problems, that you are aware there may be other consequences you don't know
about, that you are aware there are other options besides eating meat, that
you are aware of all this, and you are still willing to accept any of the
consequences your action will have, then I 100% support your decision to
eat meat.  If you do have any objections to your action, and aren't willing
to accept the consequences, then why eat meat?  That's all I'm saying.  I'm
not arguing any moral issues, because morality is something we must each
decide in our own conscience.  The same is true for any action.  Like
choosing to take drugs.   Or choosing to have sex.  Or anything.  Just
don't hide behind ignorance or excuses.  Know your choices and know their
consequences.  plur, dan

not to be a devil's advocate, (but I will)...

I could easily kill another human being and eat him/her.  Plus, while I
understand it is harder to get all necessary vitamins w/o eating meat, I
also understand that it is much healthier in the long run avoiding all
the unhealthy things associated w/ meat.

Not to be mean or anything, but I know more "party-kids" who are thieves and
scam artists than of any other group of people that I know.  If you just now
found out that there are such things are shady ravers, you have been living in
the dark.

but you are arguing moral issues! 
you are saying that if everyone knew what went into meat that no one would eat it

i am a vegetarian.  i don't go around trying to convince anyone that they should not eat meat

i don't do drugs or drink alcohol  i also don't go around trying to convince people that they should not do drugs or drink.
these are very personal choices that are independent of facts
you can't lay a bunch of quasi-facts on the line and expect people to change their minds and be like you
they must come to these crossroads all by themselves

"living in the dark" and "new to the scene" go together (which I am-the 
latter...and apparently the former). I wanted to expect a utopia of 
sorts from parties--I knew I was fooling myself, but you live and learn. 
BTW...having my car raped at a Shortarm party does not reflect the 
represented...you guys are great!!! We will meet lou...I did see you 
live...good stuff. I thoroughly enjoyed myself!!!

well, id like to know if you boycott companies due to humn rights violations. i
could give you a list of companies who do shit that is compareable to the
treatment of slaughterhouse animals to their employees. if you did what was
least cruel, you would own very few things. you drink coca-cola? wear nike? use
gillette products?

humans are more important than animals, and theyre being abused all the time,
yet its not as popular as vegetarianism. why do you think that is?

Two questions i have:

1. One person choosiing to not eat meat or even ten people doing the same,
has no real affect on anyone killing animals for meat....does it? 

2. What does any of this have to do with the point of this list?!?!

>  no one needs meat to live
you are right!! however.. to live a healthy and balanced life you SHOULD eat meat
.. you dont HAVE to eat meat.. but it helps..

>  i became a vegetarian when i was nine

well thats really great.. you where on the cutting edge..

> and i took slack for the better part of my life from people because of it

you took slack for this when you where 9 or what 15.. well "dare to be different"
... it really hurts to see that our society treats people this way for going
against the norm..

>  but don't put me, or any of the other vegetarians down because of your opinions
so don't make us feel like we don't have the right to our own choices.

I replied because you where being defensive.. I dont think vegetarianism is a just
cause.. so what you dont eat meat.. that doesn't give you the right the rub
cabbage and lettus in our faces because when you where 9 or 15 some people called
you names.. being a vegetarian is not a radical idea people have been doing it
seen the dawn of time.. thats like me saying.. "god darn it I sleep in my side..
and you backsleepers better not say shit" <--stupid but effective...

> hostile to those below us

everything dies so that the human race can carry on .. and when it comes down to
it the clothes you have on .. the computer you are using.. the car you drive.. it
is all leading to the grand end of the earth.. I dont think not eating meat is
going to prevent our demise ...

> i just can't stand when people knock other people for having a different
lifestyle

so do you date only vegetarians.. and shop at vegetarian run stores.. and go to
vegetarian concerts?


final thought..

when monkey became man.. we first figured out how to protect our selves from
nature.. then we discovered how to feed our selves .. then we made cars and
computers and junk like that.. and remember.. if a cow could.. it would kill you
and everything you love..

max

ps. sorry I wont send big annoying emails like this anymore.. my bad..

For those of you who are a
DJ/producer/promoter/avid party goer, here's some
info on the 1999 Winter Music Conference in
Miami.  The dates are March 13-17.  I went last
year and it was well worth the trip.

The conference is designed as a meeting place for
all of those in the dance music industry to come
together at one time in one place.  Although there
are tons of people who just go because every DJ
imaginable is there that week.  There are parties
and club nights every night of  the week, usually
about 5 each night (last year we couldn't decide
where to go some nights.  you had to choose from
Carl Cox, Sasha & Diggers, Rabbit In The Moon, and
Goldie).  During the day there are panels and
workshops to attend at the Hilton where the
conference is centered.  I recommend staying there
if you're going to attend any of these.  It's
pricey at $165 a night. You need to purchase a
badge to get into the panels and workshops and to
get the $165/night rate.  The badge also gets you
into a lot of the parties and clubs too.  If just
going to party, there are many cheaper hotels on
Miami Beach.  You can find something for $70 a
night there.

For more info. go to www.wmcon.com
or email me with any questions

hello, i was hoping that someone could help my friend Sarah and I, you
see, she had her backpack stolen at Continuum, sometime after 6:30am.
there was some items that were sorta valuable (pager, cell phone, and her
moms camera) + a few other things that are of value only to her.... i hope
someone out there knows what happened to it b/c no one deserves anything
to be stolen from them.... any info on this would be appreciated.
 
thanx in advance,
BeCCa*

Could you please give me a list?  I do avoid products/companies that I know
cause suffering/cruelty, and do my best to only use products that are
animal free (shampoo, etc.), avoid wearing leather, but I know that there
are probably things I'm using that aren't cruelty-free that I'm unaware of.
I really don't own all that many things.  I live a lifestyle of voluntary
simplicity, and it has made my life richer.

I don't know.  I'm against cruelty to all living things, humans included.

sorry about the crosspost, just wanted to clarify:

there is a mailing list (unmoderated mayhem) for the cincyrave scene at:

	cincyrave@sdf1.revolt.com

outside submissions are welcome, but ivf you want to subscribe, send a letter with the subject: subscribe to:

	cincyrave-request@sdf1.revolt.com

the list is running procmail SmartList for those of you interested in the technical details, (or if you want to read more about how to use the list since i dont really have time for a SmartList tutorial).

its pretty much self-explanitory though, you mail the list, it dists out to the 3 subscribers (or however many have tagged on in the list's long 20 minute lifetime..)

cheers,
chris@revolt.com

I think there might be a drugs/shade/thieving raver connection here <snicker>

i own very few things. 

>humans are more important than animals, and theyre being abused 
>all the time, yet its not as popular as vegetarianism. 
>why do you think that is? 

because people don't get together and dance enough?
you'd think the unity felt when the vibe is good to be incompatible with 
the separation necessary to keep us from caring about each others
suffering, to keep us working for bosses for money to buy things we
don't need instead of working for each other for what's important.
yet still hostilities exist even within this list,
every so often an attack forms because someone can't dance well or
doesn't dance or can't distinguish between genres or likes house or
doesn't like house or is too geeky or is vegetarian or does drugs or
dresses kidlike,
why do you think that is?                           
has PLUR really become an obsolete and embarrassing acronym?
                           
also, vegetarianism is easier. you can read labels and know if a product
contains animal products, but clothes and toys are unfortunately not
conveniently marked 'MADE IN A SWEATSHOP'.

Glad to hear that the cinci scene is good.  I can't wait.  A net meeting would
be great.  If anyone organizes one add me to the list of atendEs.

Venue: Well the rink is my favorite place. I know it's clean, you can smoke,
bathrooms, running water...plenty of room to move. I just like it there, no
matter how many times I have been there. The only thing I hated was the
stringy stuff hanging around...I think I got caught in that shit/tripped
over it a thousand times, but that's cool...I liked seeing people trip over
it as Im sure they had fun watching me trip over it like a jackass.

Music: I knew the music was going to be techno....I looked at the flyer
before making a decision to go. Anyways I enjoyed every-single minute of the
music Friday night/morning.

People: Well I didn't have any problems w/ non-ravers being there. How can
you tell if someone is a non-raver? By the way they dress? Hmm. As always
Cleveland kids are awesome. I met some pretty cool kids...alot of young
ones...but that's okay. I did notice that there was a different "crowd"
there, meaning, I didn't see alot of people I knew like past parties. It
kinda bothered me at first...like where the hell did everyone go for christ
sakes....they disappeared.
(  

Nice meeting everyone at the netmeet :-) Hope everyone had a good time and made it home safely. As always Shortarm did a wonderful job...Thank you!! 

Peace
-Amy

I don't think so, but i think its from a lack of tapes.
I'm definitely a slacker in that department.

HOWEVER: speaking of real-audio, i just kooked up a page for my own sonic 
projects, and i hope you all will check it out at some point or another.

http://www.pitt.edu/~gmmst22/yellow.htm

Its got some sample tunes/tune pieces that i've worked on, but there's
much, much more coming in the future, including some Real-Audio mixtapes.

Alot of the stuff on there is going to be jungle and hardcore, but don't
but there will also be lots of downtempo, and experimental stuff, and even
some garagish tunes.  and just random unfinished pieces - that i encourage
people to steal and fuck with themselves.

Well, the van trip went off.  Thanks Steffan ;)
(my tour guide), MrRab, Nett & Gage.  Poor Bambi
lost his life and that makes me sad.  We were a
little shaken up by that.  But, we made it there
on time.  After purchasing a new tire (thanks to
Bambi), I made it in the doors about 1pm.  No line
at all.

quote of the day/night:

the dc armory (humungo!!)
8 am (ah, sorry, it just seemed like 8 am...that
would really be 8 pm)
about 4,000 people left dancing in the main arena
light show to blow your mind (optical
delusion...woa!!)
floors vibrating, bass in your chest
scott henry  (loud, boomin', classic early
morning, hard to contain yourself set)

"Where are all the vocals?  I think a lot more
people would be dancing if they'd play some speed
garage."
-MrRab
?!?!
(it's ok.  MrRab was also the hit of the night
with his glow stick man outfit.  people were just
going up to him and telling him that they loved
him and that he made their night.  so, he made my
night too!)

Ok, the review.  First off, the production was
pretty darn incredible.  Completely organized.
All DJs showed and came through with some pretty
amazing stuff.  I'd have to say that my favorites
were Tsuyoshi Suzuki, Icey (for his music
selection, not skills), and Scott Henry.  The
lights in the main room were amazing.  If I can
swing bringing Optical Delusion to Pittsburgh, I
will.  The place was decorated to the max.  The
jungle room had chinese lanterns and plants
everywhere.  Totally cool.  In the main arena
there were these silver glittery icicle things
hanging everywhere.  And the giant balloon they
were shooting projections off of was awesome.

The crowd.
Well, I didn't find out until about 8pm that there
was an outside sound system set up for the
smokers.  When I finally walked out there I found
out where all the hoodlums had been hiding all
day.  It was insane.  Here we are in the armory
and they have this ghetto system set up with all
the b boys and girls hovering around (like 500
maybe) .  There were houses a stone's throw away.
Go figure.  I can't.  But anyway, this was shade
central.  But inside was another story.
Traditionally when I've been to parties in DC,
Philly, NY,  I expect a certain attitude to be
present.  Let's just say, not too much
candy-ravin'.  But actually I was pleasantly
surprised.  So many people dancing.  I'd say 90%
of the party was.  All in all, a good crowd.

pb-cle
We were the only ones there that didn't have a net
sign up.  Each city (group of cities) had a big
sign at the net meet area.  I wish more people
from the list would have gone, or more from this
area in general.  There were about 30 people there
from Pgh and Ohio that I noticed and half of them
were with us.

A good time was had by all.  Except Rich.  He
claimed that I didn't cook the gobbler long enough
on Thanksgiving (upset tummy) and slept in the van
all nite.  Ended up he ate too much chocolate.

What's up? We originally planned on not having presale tickets for "Be
Square." but due to the huge response we've been getting and the expected
turnout, we are selling them for $15.  We have a very large, VIRGIN
warehouse that we have located, let me tell you that this place is phat
as hell, and it's really clean!  But there is a good chance that we will
fill it up, so getting a ticket will get you in for sure, and you also
won't have to get there before 12 to get in for $15. You can get tickets
through us, just send a check or money order to my addy below, and I will
send you your tickets.  We decided to do this because so many people
wanted presales, so here you go. 
peace.

Just to add my 2 cents on the topic of classifications.  Classifications
of music are pruly there for the consumer who is looking to find a
certain style of music in a music store.  I used to work at a record
store, and it just makes it easier to find if you can give it a title. 
What is "alternative" music?? It's not the alternative to what everyone
is listening to, it should be called pop, because it's what's popular. 
But "pop" has become it's own style of music.  Like I said, labeling is
there for consumers to find what they want in the store without having to
break it down further, which is too complex for the average consumer. 
Generalize it and you have your 5-10 basic catagories to look through. 
Some artists can't ever been given a classification, like "ween," so you
would have to have too many bins in the store with one or two albums.
  peace.

theres the problem right there. supposedly you care, yet you dont care
enough to put out effort to end human suffering? this is the inconsistency i
see in alot of vegetarians. do you really care? you must ask yourself. if
you really cared, i dont think that anything would get in your way.

ill see if i can find one electronically, otherwise ill type one out. just to let
you know, youll own basically no big company shoes, use select personal hygene
products, and not eat fast food at all. youll drink only generic soda. its not easy,
trust me. actually, i think its impossible. every international corporation does
something horrible to someone.

btw, how "voluntary simplistic" are computers?

>its not easy, trust me.

i pay attention to what companies and countries the few things i buy
come from, taking into consideration what i know about how those who
worked to create a product may have been treated.
i own no big company shoes, use select personal hygeine products,
do not eat fast food at all, and do not drink soda at all.
it's not hard.
i never said i cared.
you asked, why isn't boycotting companies who contribute to human rights
violations as popular as vegetarianism?
i answered, vegetarianism is easier.

So I'm thinking where's all the Continuum reviews?  And then I realize that
I haven't gotten a PB-Cle mail for 3 days.  I must've somehow gotten
accidentally kicked off PB-Cle, but I'm OK now.  Could someone please
forward me a few of the reviews?  Everyone have a great time?

Here was my weekend for Shift in Toronto.

We ("we" being me <
http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Mezzanine/6292/phat5.jpg >, my roomie
Bob = DJ Memazeen for those of you that have seen him at the Avenue <
http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Mezzanine/6292/phat2.jpg beside me >,
my friend Byron who you'll doubtless see madly spinning darkass drum'n'bass
at a party near you soon <
http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Mezzanine/6292/avenue4.jpg >, and Sara
who was going to her first proper party) got up there around 3PM Saturday
and went to my buddy Rod's house.  He's the perfect host.  He takes us
exactly where we want !need! to go and gets us what we want !need! for the
party and lets us shower and listen to records at his house and feeds
us...and he's even going to a different party.  So first, we headed out to
Eaton Center (was the world's largest mall in cooler, pre-Mall-of-America
years) in the middle of downtown to pick up our tickets in the middle of
post-(American) Thanksgiving shopping frenzy and there's dance music
everywhere, coming from every store, and even a fashion show with that damn
Music Sounds Better With You played with the lyrics
from fergodsakes Madonna's Holiday.  (If you took a holiday, oh yeah, oh
yeah.  Some demented guy with access to way too much studio equipment
realizes that Madonna's lyrics fit over the song perfectly, and we all have
to pay the price.  Just one day out of life, it would be, it would be so
nice.)  So after forging our way out of that pit of people, we walk down
the road to 2 great record stores (Eastern Bloc has much jungle.  Byron is
a happy boy.)  (The Pit has an owner who plays me all his favorite records
hoping I'll like them so much that I pay him for them.  I do.)  Between the
3 of us we spend about Cn$500 on records.  Luckily, the world economic
situation, as always, has favored America.  Right now US$1 = Cn$1.55 now
and so all of Canada is 35% off.

And the party:

The techno DJs were mostly Swedes, the ones from Continuum, the driving
forces in techno recently:  Adam Beyer (techno's man to beat in 1997), Joel
Mull (techno's man to beat in 1998), and Christian Smith (probably the
least famous of the 3).  Claude Young was also headlining.  Claude's as
tricky as fuck, but doing his dropouts and assorted mixing-board gymnastics
with hardasfuck techno.  He did some amazing shit, juggling the faders in
obscene ways.  There was this one trick that really blew me away.  He had
his hand spread out like he was holding a basketball, centered over the
middle of the turntable and tossed the record back and forth in beat a few
times before letting it play again.  And the clincher is that the song was
a smooth warm fuzzy techhouse record that you'd never imagine being
sliced&stacked up like that, but the way he did it it made you think that
that was probably the way it was meant to be played.  

But Christian Smith was the man of the night.  Again.  My prediction: 
*he'll* be the man to beat in 1999.  Some of the breaks in his songs were
these amazing scuplted sound things that sounded like none of the other DJs
that night.  And he mixed them all eq-heavy, going for the long bassless
stretches and then he catches the eye of one raver hanging on the edge
screaming for the beat to come back in and then he drops the bass back in
and the whole crowd whoops.  A lot of the techno people had left by the
time he played at 4:30 or so, so the crowd wasn't as huge as it had been
earlier, but he had the core of them going crazy, yelling, cheering.

The space was Toronto's eqivalent of Cleveland's I-X center.  The place was
filled with 1000s of kids, but it didn't get crowded or hot.  I like the
spots a bit more intimate myself, like pHryl's Progress was earlier this
year, but--hey--I'm nitpicking here.  And I love those Toronto kids.  Met a
kid that we'd hung with at Progress...rolling reunions...oh yeah.

And a damn good time was had by all.

Ken

and heres where my point is coming from. vegetarianism = the easy way out.
it doesnt really help much of anything. its just an excuse. people need to
quit making excuses. the only way to get results is DIRECT ACTION.
vegetarianism (amongst many other things) is just an excuse not to get
really involved.

Hey,
  These parties are both on 12.05.98 and at both of these parties DJ SUN 
is supposed to spin. I'm assuming these are two different DJs, and if 
so, are we (PGH) getting the one who spun at BENT? I hope so. If this 
has been posted, sorry I'm behind on my mail...

None of the above taste nearly as good as a nice rare prime rib or

But why would we want to? If we aren't supposed to eat animals, why
are they made of meat?

And you would be wrong in arguing it.

Because they are sooooo tasty! Besides, anyone why argues against
eating seafood is a nut. Fish are so dumb they deserve to be eaten, 
and crustaceans are nothing but big bugs.

I have tried many of them, and not one even comes close to the real

Bring it on. Even the best vegitarian dishes are sad in comparison
to even lowly vienna sausages.

Why? Because they are just animals and Thanksgiving turkey is awesome.

completely agreed
has anyone ever combined a rave with an explicit action for specific change?
there's so much energy there, if any of it could be focused for a time...

>heres where my point is coming from. vegetarianism = the easy way out.
>it doesnt really help much of anything. its just an excuse. 

vegetarianism is not a way out of anything but meat-related health problems.
it's not an escape, it's not an excuse, it's a Diet.
it doesn't consume any more time and effort than a meat-based diet.
what you chose to eat won't solve all the problems of the world directly,
but if you're not healthy you're not going to be doing 
much else to solve the world's problems,
and not everybody can be as healthy with meat as without.
and maybe it's a start, maybe once people start evaluating the impact of
their diet on themselves, their environment, and other people, that will
lead to further thinking about how other aspects of their lives
reflect/contradict what's important to them. 
at least vegetarianism had you Thinking about what you eat, why, whether
you should change that, whether it matters to you, and what matters more
to you than what you consume.
