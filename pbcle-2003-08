Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} TripOutNY list



This is a cool list I belong to. I am sending out
invites on the behalf of the TripOutNY list.

send a blank email to TripOutNY-subscribe@yahoogroups.com

You can get alot of good information on psytrance events 
and culture in New York and all around the US

Peace,
Luke
www.goaheadproductions.com
 

Secondly, I'm doing a membership drive this week.  Trance in New York, the 
crossroads of the world,  thrives because of new people whether they are small 
town Midwesterners here to make their mark or cultured travellers who carry 
home fond memories of the trance family here.  Everyone, do me a favor and fwd 
out this message to your friends, and invite them to join by sending a blank 
email to <a HREF="mailto:TripOutNY-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">TripOutNY-
subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>
It's free, it's weekly, and it will exist as long as the circulation keeps 
rising...  And the more on trip Out, the more eventuially gets funnelled to 
Safetydance, and that's where things start to get really interesting!  Because 
then, if female they end up in my <a 
HREF="http://www.rdrop.com/~glacier/yurt.htm">yurt</a>, and if male, I end up 
with their bank 
account :-)

Yo Kaleo and Dan!
What can I say?!  You had people going from midnight until 2am.  People were 
even dancing in the aisle on the way back to the patio ... and the whole 
place was applauding you at the end of your set.

Thanks for playing and providing such a great vibe.

Big thanks to Antone for bringing all the drums.  His live persussion was on 
last night - Made the place that much hotter.

I saw alot of people dancing that I've never seen move before  (Kaleo)  ;)

Yo Kaleo and Dan!
What can I say?!  You had people going from midnight until 2am.  People were
even dancing in the aisle on the way back to the patio ... and the whole
place was applauding you at the end of your set.

Thanks for playing and providing such a great vibe.

Big thanks to Antone for bringing all the drums.  His live persussion was on
last night - Made the place that much hotter.

I saw alot of people dancing that I've never seen move before  (Kaleo)  ;)

Anyone who wants to go, email me your name and I will put you on the

Subject: {pb-cle} Advertising in BASSLINE MAGAZINE

What's up everyone. BASSLINE magazine is getting
underway. We are currently looking for anyone
interested in advertising (i.e. Record stores,
production companies, Lighting/Visual Companies,
Graphic Design companies, Clothing stores, etc.) We
are based out of central Ohio, and will be reaching
the Philly/east coast area. We are always looking for
writers and photographers who would like to
contribute.

If you have any questions please email
contactbassline@hotmail.com

Thanks!
stephanie collier

THE MISSION FOR BASSLINE: 
BASSLINE is a music-culture magazine focusing on
underground electronic music such as drum and bass,
house, breaks, techno and trance just to name a few
genres, as well as underground hip hop. This magazine
is for you, the people of the scene, whether youre a
DJ, producer, party-goer, MC, b-boy, or just
appreciate and love the music. BASSLINE is here to
keep us all connected. The hope of this magazine is to
grow from the Midwest and east coast to reach all
parts of the country. Times are changing, as they have
been and will continue to do so. You can see this
change with a simple illustration of technologys
progression, where the mix-tape now seems old-skool
and MP3s are the norm. Our mission is to try to reach
everyone and give light to how people are trying to
keep the underground alive in these changing times. By
focusing on club events, parties, shows, new music
releases, profiling producers, spotlighting
up-and-coming heads as well as covering issues
affecting hip hop and electronic musics culture,
BASSLINE hopes to reflect our scene. We must embrace
our culture with the knowledge and understanding so
that our scene continues to strive for the next
generations. Music is the universal language that
connects us all. Everyone listen for the bass line.

Subject: {pb-cle} plastikman - closer

a new plastikman album ( closer ) is coming out Oct. 20th, i got an 
advanced copy and i am listening to this sucker right now. it is wicked. 
  it is similar to consumed in many was but it is definately a more 
evolved sound. it is really dark and full of strange sounds that pop out 
at you from no where. i believe the single "disconnect" is to be 
released before the full length album. disconnect contains vocals by 
richie, when i heard this i was a little skeptical but after listening 
to the tune i am blown away. Here is a sample of the lyrical content in 
disconnect:

"i try to disenfect, and sanitize my brain, perhaps i won't be satisfied 
until i go insane, disconnect, disconnect, disconnect, disconnect my brain"

i must recommend it to all of you...

All I know is that you must have been doing it the wrong way.  Did 
you use a butane lighter to heat it above the boiling point of 400 
degrees?  if you didnt do that, then i can imagine it didnt do 
much for you.

I got a feeling that the dogs will be more
well behaved then the people.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Chili Peppers!!!

September 22nd.... 2 days after my 24th Bday

Bought tickets this morning.  I've been waiting forever to see 
them.  They were here when I was like 15/16 and have only been 
here once since then and that was at RollingRock a few years back, 
which I did not attend of course.

I'm excited.

    musically speaking, that's not hard to do,
    since all the music was indoors at wemf.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MM3 ? anyone?

All the DJ's were great!  I really got into DJ Pauley's set.  What can you
say about Miss Lisa.  I was awestruck by her beauty.  She was out walking
around in the crowd before and after her set.  MM3 seemed to have a good
vibe. Security was even cool...  I didn't find the bottom room until later
on in the night.

Subject: {pb-cle} Maataa Mandara III 



Ok people, it's time to take uncle Luke's advice and
start making plans for Maataa Mandara III in 
the hills of WV. All you need to do is check out the pics
of the Gaian mind festival to know what you will
be in store for. Plus note that this is the III Maataa
Mandara, so it is a proven event!  Trust me. Moke 
will confirm that I know what I'm talkin about. 
Get your asses to this event! $45 for a weekend
of full on freaks and psytrance and camping. 
Plus..uncle Luke is gonna be 35.  Take one last
chance to enjoy the great outdoors this summer.



http://www.gaian-mind.com/mmiii.htm
Lineup and info to be confirmed later this week

 
werd,
Luke

Ok people, it's time to take uncle Luke's advice and
start making plans for Maataa Mandara III in 
the hills of WV. All you need to do is check out the pics
of the Gaian mind festival to know what you will
be in store for. Plus note that this is the III Maataa
Mandara, so it is a proven event!  Trust me. Moke 
will confirm that I know what I'm talkin about. 
Get your asses to this event! $45 for a weekend
of full on freaks and psytrance and camping. 
Plus..uncle Luke is gonna be 35.  Take one last
chance to enjoy the great outdoors this summer.

Lineup and info to be confirmed later this week

i saw them at that show at the civic arena in 96. i was actually 
just wearing my tour tshirt from that last tuesday at funk and 
soul night. my clothes are old. they killed it that night. i want 
to go see them this time, but i hate the arena. but their last 
album is their best album and in my top 10 all time records in any 
genre and id love to see them play most of it live. so i dont 
know.

Was it '96?...I was thinking it was '95.  So I guess I was like 
16/17 then.  I missed that concert and then bailed out of seeing 
them at rollingrock a few years back.  

The latest is one of the best, but I still have a thing for 
Mother's Milk and BloodSugarSexMagick

For me it was the the RHCP in '91 at the AJ Palumbo Center with Smashing 
Pumpkins AND Pearl Jam opening for them.  Back then - you couldn't beat a 
line-up like that - funny ... nobody even knew who Pearl Jam was (Alive was 
their only hit single) - Smashing Pumpkins almost got boo'ed off the stage 
and the Chili Peppers still rocked songs from their early albums Freaky 
Styley and Uplift Mofo Party Plan ...

ah ... to be in highschool again.

I also remember Chili Peppers playing the Electric Banana ... but I was only 
15 or 16 for that one.

Subject: {pb-cle} Old Dirty?

Someone please help me understand this one. I was under the impression that 
ODB went down for life without parole because he pulled a gun on a cop, 
giving him 3 strikes. To the point that Method Man even cracked on him for 
it on the Blackout tape. Now he's out and has a reality based TV show 
starting on VH1? Any thoughts on what the deal is?

HELL YEAH!!

I was there. That's where I first heard about both Pearl Jam and the Pumpkins.

I, personally, don't remember them being booed...but that's because I fell in love with their music
that night. Gish is still among my favorite albums of all time...

I remember Pearl Jam getting zero response that night,
Billy Corgan yelling at the crowd get of its ass
(after which the chairs came off the floor and a pit
emerged), the chilis absolutely tearing shit up, and
flea smashing his bass at the end of the show (i still
want to know how he can play as clean as he does while
dancing around like a chimpanzee on crack)...one of
the most fun shows I've ever been to.

Someone please help me understand this one. I was under the impression
that 
ODB went down for life without parole because he pulled a gun on a cop,

I can honestly say MM3 was a great party. I feel bad
for the Zelch's b/c not as many ppl came that I
thought would. It was great seeing friends from years
ago that I haven't seen in a while and all the Dj's
were awesome. Jen Lasher and the Executioners were
unbelievable.. Sorry this is delayed but I havne't
been in this box for a while. 

Peace, Bruke

1 full bowl in a water pipe with a butane lighter.  anything less would be
uncivilized.

-goose

ps. hold in each inhale for 20-30 seconds, dont worry so much about downing
multiple bowls, just hit the one hard and long, and it will treat you right.
only downside, the smoke isnt the most pleasant, it smells like you're doing
yardwork and burning tree leaves.
(how much did that sound like a tim hayes response?  meep.)

I think you're right.  Early 96 it was (with emphasis on early).  
I knew it was my sophomore year, but I thought it was in the 
fall.  I was 16.

And how can you not like Mother's Milk?  I actually pretty much 
love them all, but that was a favorite.  Although I'm still 
reluctant to  say "By the way" is better than BloodSugarSexMagick 
as you did....

Lots to do this weekend in your favorite cave. Come on out. Er, in. Er, =

Friday, HeadRush Music's Ian flies in from New York City and Magnetic's =
Darrel Sound flies in from Miami to drop a night of soulful house for a =
weekend warmup. Open until 2:30am. No cover.

Saturday, Mazi jets in from Chicago to play part Six of the Summer =

From: "justin ....." <polarbear@andythepooh.com>

>And how can you not like Mother's Milk? 

i dont know. aside from a couple tracks i just didnt think it
played out well as an album. keep in mind that me not liking it is
not like me not liking something else, its just comparatively.....

>Although I'm still 
>reluctant to  say "By the way" is better than BloodSugarSexMagick 
>as you did....

by the way is their best because of its sublety, its emotion, and
its songwriting. whereas bloodsugar would hit you over the head
with dynamic changes and extremely funky joints, by the way is
like a nice hot summer afternoon. its got a warm feeling that you
wish would last forever, and the subtle melodies of experienced
songwriters. most bands start to suck after their first couple of
records. only the best get better with age (beatles, radiohead,
chilis). just anthony keidis' singing improvement alone is
awesome. it was like he learned to sing for californication, but
that album was just a warm up for by the way. anyway, ill bet that
25 years from now rock kids will be name dropping by the way the
way kids now name drop pet sounds (which i fucking hate, BTW).

I'll be in DC/Baltimore.

I will, at least, get to see Mr. Tony Kornheiser in action, just because I'm
a dork like that.

A curious fellow died one day and found himself waiting in the
long line of judgment. As he stood there he noticed that some
souls
were
allowed to march right through the pearly gates into Heaven.
Others
   though,
were led over to Satan who threw them into the burning pit.
But every so often, instead of hurling a poor soul into the
fire, Satan would toss a soul off to one side into a small
pile.

After watching Satan do this several times, the fellow's
curiosity got the best of him. So he strolled over and asked
Satan
what
   he
was doing.
Excuse me, Mr. Prince of Darkness," he said. "I'm waiting in
line
for
judgment, but I couldn't help wondering...why are you tossing
those
people aside instead of flinging them into the Fires of Hell
with
the
others?"

"Ah, those...," Satan said with a groan. "They're all from
Ohio,
still too wet to burn."

relatively speaking, yes. driving, anyway. walking? not so close.

spi - kinda near the convention center, smallman st. (across from donzi's, etc.)

to get to the bbt from there, go two streets up to liberty, and head away from town until you hit
bloomfield.

MAYBE take you 10 minutes to get there if you hit all the lights.

You=B9ll have an advantage if you bring lots of friends to cheer you on.  We
make this easier for you by giving all those people $4 reduced admission th=
e
night you spin.


ADVICE:  like anything in life, you have to actively pursue any opportunity
to further yourself.  This is not a popularity contest if YOU don=B9t let it
be.   Hand out demo CD=B9s, attend every local party you can, have your
friends email their friends to email their friends and so on to alert peopl=
e
on various messageboards to links to your mixes. Announce any gigs at which
you=B9re spinning.  Once people are aware of your abilities, the more likely
they will vote for you.

The voting starts NOW!

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

SEAN CUSICK
(bedrock, balance, hallucination, saw)

Sean Cusick's definitive blend of psychedelic house and techno has firmly
established him as a globally recognized DJ and producer. His unique range
of intoxicating music has put him in demand behind the decks from Tokyo to
Prague. As a producer, you've seen his work under guises such as Second
Hand Satellites with DJ Three on Hallucination/Shaboom Records and
Freelance Icebreakers with Jimmy Van M. He recently collaborated with
Medway on "Neutrix" for Saw Recordings and is currently producing a
full-length album on the Viscous label out of Manchester. Recently, John
Digweed used Sean's "Of Course" for his MMII mix cd and subsequently
signed the track to his Bedrock label under the name Sean Q6. On top of
all this, Sean also pens a monthly column for xpander 
[ http://www.xpander.nl ], filling it with his unique brand of scathing
humor and "shoot from the hip" attitude.

Dayton, Ohio, USA, Earth

Featuring...


D J B A M B A M
Contamin8ted / Jackstar / Topaz / Chicago
Experience the hard, jackin beats of the turntable intoxicator. Some call 
him Mr. Bigfoot, others a windy city wizard of wax, but most will 
recognize this sorcerer of sound as DJ Bam Bam. Utilizing his musical 
aptness, Bam Bam has touched audiences worldwide. For the last nine years, 
he has been directly involved in and thus accredited for increasing 
awareness and popularity of hard Chicago techno/hard house music.

J O S H "T H E F U N K Y 1"
Funktion / Mix Connection / Kid Dynamite / Chicago
A DJ for over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, 
tech-house and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable 
tricks. 1997 saw Josh become a DMC Midwest Finalist. In 1999 he competed 
in the Winter Music Conference scratching competition where he was a 
runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In 2000 Josh took 1st place 
in the beat-mixing competition at the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off. 
Aside from competing, Joshs passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which 
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh 
has also helped co-produce legendary Bad Boy Bills "Bangin the Box Vol. 
4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

M I X I N' M A R C
B96 / SHR Group / Logic / Static Brothers / Chicago
Currently dividing his time between his hometown of Chicago and gigs in 
such places as Cancun and New York City, Mixin Marc is requested by his 
fans time and time again. Not just an experienced club resident, Marc 
pumps the crowd at raves all across the country. Guest spots with other 
heavyweights in the scene include Dave Ralph, Frankie Bones, DJ Skribble, 
Richard Humpty Vision, Charles Feelgood and B96 jock Bad Boy Bill. 
Recently headlining alongside DJ Irene and Armand Van Helden, Mixin' Marc 
has received praise not only for his abilities, but also for his demeanor. 
A professional to the core, music is his life... and his passion. Now 
working into 2001, expect only the best from Mixin' Marc... and that's 
exactly what you'll receive. Top of the line bangin' club hits, a blend of 
rich trance with a touch of domestic and European techno.

F A D E
www.poopiehead.net / www.djfade.com / Milwaukee
Originally from Madison, WI, Fade has been on the leading edge of the
Midwest breakbeat movement. Busy with two weekly internet broadcasts,
www.club246.com, and www.ravetrax.com, he is also one of the founding
fathers of Madison's premiere breaks night, "Magnetic" at the King Klub,
and the breaks buyer at Milwaukee's Trounce Records. Known for his
intense, bass-throbing breaks, Fade is quickly gaining recognition as one
of the Midwest's favorite breaks djs.

Inner Child House Collective:

Inner Child strives to showcase the highest caliber of talent to the
Pittsburgh area: artists new to the local scene, and artists which have
not been here for many years.  With the success of iPhunk in November of
2002, and the prior success of the groundbreaking event, Phunkadelik, in
April of 2000, Inner Child has been progressing through the local
Pittsburgh scene as a collective that is truly dedicated to the music,
which we all lovenot the politics.  Two solid weeklies at the infamous
dejAVu lounge, Mango and Agave, have proved to the local scene the
compatibility of multiple genres, while expressing all styles of House
music.  Mango has been a force to reckon with, entertaining at least 700
or more guests every Saturday, featuring the finest local and regional
talent while providing an upscale and plush atmosphere.  Agave, our newest
brainchild, combines the best underground House music with other
compatible dance genres.  Inner Child is now proud to offer Pittsburgh,
the surrounding areas, all who have supported us in the past, and all who
wish to support us now and in the future, an event of such simple ideas
yet such massive proportions. We hope to bring out the Inner Child in
all who attend! Prepare yourself for PHUNKTIFIED!

 

Happy Birthday Ova, Ian, and Jenn!

Invisible Sounds _ Dayton

"If you ain't gonna beat it, you better stay home". These are words every 
DJ should live by, and J.J. is a true example of the jaw dropping effect 
this mentality brings to the floor.  Think Roc Raida meets Claude Young 
turntablism and uncompromising track selection.  This is a long overdue 
appearance, and were ecstatic to bring this outstanding DJ to electrify 
the crowd at 'Techncolour'.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he is mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that

min) on those days in order to move on to the French haircutting class. Longer 
hair takes longer....

If interested e-mail me, leave a message at 614.296.5771

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight@Havana - JOSE MORAN & SELECTIVE SOUL

THURSDAYS @ HAVANA
Tonight 08.07.03

[d. c. SPACE] and [JOSE MORAN] - 10pm - 2am - Tonight, Brother Mike and Jose 
will be playing my kind of music ... deep and soulful ... look for smiles on 
peoples faces.

[SELECTIVE SOUL] - 11pm - Rockin with the Final Scratch.

NO COVER / 21+ / I.D. Required
$2 Yuenglings and $3 Sangrias
Look for free shots around 12:30am
Bar on the back patio now open. (weather permitting)

********************************************************************
Congrats to Disco Dan, Kaleo and Bethany and whoever else that was involved 
with putting on the Exposed Fashion Show last night.  That was a great 
night; Good music, Great fashion, Fun vibe.  If you missed it - shame on 
you.  Check out these cats every Wednesday at the SPI Bar in the strip.

Also, this weekend is the Shadyside Arts Festival.  (Parking is going to be 
a bitch)
Anyway, last year the city provided me with enough money to be able to have 
a sound system, stage and pay for DJs to play outside in the evenings.  
Sorry to say, this year no funds were given out so there will be no DJs 
playing in the streets.  We will still be having Salsa and Merengue Dancing 
in the streets (the city will fund that. go figure) but there will still be 
DJs playing inside ... so if you're around - stop on in.

Records - Funk and Soul
Saturday 10pm - 2am - [d. c. SPACE] - Deep House

Subject: {pb-cle} last night @ annabells

I wanted to thank everyone who came out last night, I had an awesome time.  
It was nice to see everyone out there dancing the whole night.  Anyone who 
didn't get my new cd can send me an email and I'll try to get one out to 
you. I'll also have quite a few at field day to pass out.  Thanks everyone.

Subject: {pb-cle} new dub/reggae mix for download

hey y'all... frankie g here...

i haven't been on this list in a few years, but was a pretty hard-
core member from 1994-1999. for those of you that don't know me, 
i'm 1/2 of the illest 3turntable2deejayjunglisticalcrew in the 
burgh (circuit 6).

anyways, i'm writing to let you know that i've recorded my first 
non-jungle mix cd... it's all dub and reggae that spans from the 
late 60's to the early 80's. even if you don't listen to this kind 
of stuff, you're likely to be down, so check it out.

http://frankieg.412dnb.com

hit me back with feedback once you've listened to it. and rave the 
fuck on :) 

...frankie g

ps - if you see me out at a club or a party or something, ask for 
a cd, because i'll probably have a stack of em.

I'm down with that, probably can't make a lunch picnic.  Don't know

;)

how about we all have a cookout saturday, dine and wine type style and
have that as the netmeet? Could be a good way of getting to know some
people you've never met yet. =)

Subject: {pb-cle} Speaker Question

OK, my ignorance is going to show here, but someone please help me out. What 
the hell does it mean when a speaker claims to be "digital ready?" If I am 
hooking it up to my stereo's speaker terminals, its analog right? If they 
aren't powered, and I don't hook to the +/- outs, there won't be any sound. 
Is it just some crappy marketing technique that effectively means 'not 
shit'?

i would assume it would mean that it can take an optical line.  does it
have a tiny little square slot on the back of each speaker?

Well, you see, its a historical thing.  We had this huge ass sign that was 
printed by our buddy (check the Potent archive on my site) and I think 
trout lost it!.

On the other hand, I made one from cardboard and spraypaint (I forgot which 
party it debuted at) and I'm sure I lost it too!

Feel free to make one!

Digital Rights Management.

Digital inputs to the speakers can keep you from playing "unauthorized" music.

How about I just run down the list of people I gave passes to -- I know
jessica has a lot of you on the guest list! :)

Seriously, if you are 21 and not at revolution or mazi you need to be at
this show.  FIVE DOLLARS and while I happen to be out of vip passes I'll see
what I can do about getting you into the VIP area if you come out.  If you
haven't experienced Moda, this will be a great way to do so.  Do check it
out.  I'm almost looking forward to Cirque Du Soleil and Aphrodesiatics more
than Britt!  At WMC Britt kicked my ass 10 times harder than Farina did....
so I'm looking forward to it.

Also you can always roll over to Abbasso afterwards for Mazi... another dope
ass show.

selection, mixing abilities, phrasing, set programming and CROWD RESPONSE.
You=B9ll have an advantage if you bring lots of friends to cheer you on.  We
make this easier for you by giving all those people $4 reduced admission th=
e
night you spin.


ADVICE:  like anything in life, you have to actively pursue any opportunity
to further yourself.  This is not a popularity contest if YOU don=B9t let it
be.   Hand out demo CD=B9s, attend every local party you can, have your
friends email their friends to email their friends and so on to alert peopl=
e
on various messageboards to links to your mixes. Announce any gigs at which
you=B9re spinning.  Once people are aware of your abilities, the more likely
they will vote for you.

The voting starts NOW!

I think I'll be out for this as well... we'll see. King Britt is pretty
decent. 
But it's not "Cirque Du Soleil" that is performing... it's some
acrobatic troop, but far from the Cirque!

How about I just run down the list of people I gave passes to -- I know
jessica has a lot of you on the guest list! :)

Seriously, if you are 21 and not at revolution or mazi you need to be at
this show.  FIVE DOLLARS and while I happen to be out of vip passes I'll
see
what I can do about getting you into the VIP area if you come out.  If
you
haven't experienced Moda, this will be a great way to do so.  Do check
it
out.  I'm almost looking forward to Cirque Du Soleil and Aphrodesiatics
more
than Britt!  At WMC Britt kicked my ass 10 times harder than Farina
did....
so I'm looking forward to it.

Also you can always roll over to Abbasso afterwards for Mazi... another
dope
ass show.

That's not really true, is it?  Yikes.

Sorry about that.... Il Circo has members who have been in various Cirque Du
Soleil productions, but they are not under that name.  You are right, it is
not exactly the real thing.   I got caught up in what everyone was saying
from the last Salem party.

Been tryin' to find the link to the story... saw it on wired.com or  =
something a couple
weeks back...maybe I misread it but I thought he had just been released =
from
some type of inpatient  situation. I felt pretty bad for the kid... fun =
is
fun but his classmates def. took it too far. He hasn't been offered a =
part but there is a huge push to get him in the next Star Wars flick and =
some celebrity types gave him some gifts after hearing his story.

here's info on that video...

Star Wars Kid Leaves School, Parents Sue

Remember Ghyslain Raza, the kid who filmed himself pretending to wield a
double-ended light sabre and who unexpectedly and agonizingly found his
pantomime online? The agony may have cut a little deeper than the online
world suspected. Raza's parents are suing the four students who supposedly
uploaded the video to Kazaa for $160,000. The parents say their son has been
traumatized and requires serious psychiatric help to get on with his life
and deal with his unexpected and embarrassing celebrity. According to the
Globe and Mail, the teen left his school and completed the year at a child
psychiatry ward. It doesn't seem that the Force was very strong in this one.
Wired also has a brief.

i would assume it would mean that it can take an optical line.  does it

OK, my ignorance is going to show here, but someone please help me out.
What
the hell does it mean when a speaker claims to be "digital ready?" If I
am
hooking it up to my stereo's speaker terminals, its analog right? If
they
aren't powered, and I don't hook to the +/- outs, there won't be any
sound.
Is it just some crappy marketing technique that effectively means 'not
shit'?

i understand that it's a shame the kid had to be humiliated, but i mean, 
c'mon we all have had really humiliating moments growing up.  sounds like this kid 
was a little off anyway.  if he made this video of himself, i'm guessing he's 
probably a little reclusive and into dungeons & dragons or something of the 
sort.   i can't tell you how many people i alone have come in contact with that 
tell me his video made their day, made them laugh the hardest they have in a 
long time, etc.  i think that's worth something.  most humiliating moments 
aren't that global.  :)

am i still cruel?

Okay so the kid was effected by it.  He probably shot the thing at school 
when he wasn't supposed to be playing around anyway.  I hear some guy on the 
net 
raised him about $4000, originally just trying to get donations to buy him an 
iPod.  My friend donated through Paypal.  AND George Lucas sent him a replica 
of a light saber.  So the kid's doing fine, I'm sure.  He's somewhat of a 
celebrity.

He doesnt "seek the escape that star wars provides". The kid probably loves
the damn movie like everyone else did. I admit it's really funny, but
wouldn't crack on the kid regardless. I call it passion for star wars..

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: you must see this kid

    you are feeling some major guilt, it seems,
    taking enjoyment in someone else's embarassments,
    with all your justifications and such.

    why would you think he shot the video at school, out
    of curiousity? not that i have read that much, but i
    haven't heard anything else leading to that conclusion,
    and it seems somewhat unfounded. [granted, i haven't
    watched the video, nor read more than the wired article
    and what's been posted here]

    in any case, maybe you didn't get made fun of too much
    as a teen. with your body and looks, it wouldn't surprise
    me - there's no way you can relate to a chubby
    boy. the columbine teens were outcasts, but, they were
    just embarassing moments, right?

    a little compassion would be nice. it's good that you got
    a chuckle, or even the best laugh you've had in a while
    at someone else's expense. i guess it's alright too that
    other people that could actually *relate* to the kid sent
    some money and he's got himself an ipod. but, there's
    still people like you laughing at him and sending his
    embarassing video around.

   
    blah.. i'm drunk, and it's only 4:15 on sunday...

Damn.  That seems like a worst nightmare come true, except in reality it
becomes even more nightmarish in ways you couldn't even imagine until they
happen.

I understand your compassion, but I wasn't really trying to justify anything. 
 I'm sure you've laughed quite a bit at other people's expense.  In fact, I 
know you have.  In addition, I was ridiculed about my body and looks for over 
10 years, so please don't jump to the conclusion that because of the way I look 
now, I was always fortunate.  You don't know my history at all.  

Also, it was done at school.  That's why I listed the jedimaster.net site.  A 
good laugh is a laugh.  Had we not known the story behind, we'd still be 
laughing.

oh please.

look, why he did something is irrelevant. the fact is that if
youre stupid enough to video tape yourself doing something that
would be embarassing to you if others saw it, you get what you
deserve. personal responsibility has to enter into this equation
somewhere.

those guys were fucking stupid as well. as someone who had more
than his share of people fucking with him, i think i can say with
utmost authority that if youre strong, you learn from it, and if
youre weak you crack. what can i say? i learned when i needed to
fucking sock someone in their bitch ass mouth for talking shit. it
caused me to be asked to leave my elementary school as well as
receiving the first and third suspensions ever in the school and
setting a record for number of demerits. i didnt even care that
the people who fucked with me didnt get in the trouble i got into.
i was morally superior to them, and i maintained that and backed
it with my fists when i needed to. those columbine pussies shot
people. theyre whats called bitches. 

>    a little compassion would be nice. 

fuck him.

i laughed, but i also signed the petition for getting him into
episode 3 because obviously he's not going to take it to the punks
that did that shit to him, so ill try and help. but im still not
going to paint him as strictly a victim just becasue he's a pussy.

Well I'd have to say tha video was pretty funny.  But, I'm one to see it as harmless and he shouldnt have shot tha damn thing unless he understood ppl could see it.
 
I have sympathy, but not much... and I sure as hell think he should think before he acts... nobody feels bad for me when I do something stupid.
 
peace.

i laughed, but i also signed the petition for getting him into
episode 3 because obviously he's not going to take it to the punks
that did that shit to him, so ill try and help. but im still not
going to paint him as strictly a victim just becasue he's a pussy.

Amen.  Nicely put.  And I for one would definitely pay full price to go see 
Episode 3  just for that kid.  Maybe even twice.  Normally I'd wait for the

I use Falcon's Transmission right by the store and so far I like them.  I'm
sure they don't sepcialize in foreign cars but I bet they could handle it.
Maybe other people have opinions?

Normally associated with his peers in Techno from Detroit, Europe and 
elsewhere in the US and the world, John Tejada has embraced electronic
music 
as a personal frontier, expanding on his formidable resume as a Techno 
recording artist as producer and remixer, DJ, and label owner. With
dozens 
of singles, remixes, some film and TV work and contributions to sample
CDs 
to his credit, this recent expansion has born a slew of tracks deeply 
informed by his uncompromised aesthetic honed over years of diligent 
production which finds its roots in Detroit Techno but references a far 
broader range of music, both in and outside of electronic music. His 
musically formative years were steeped in Classical music, growing up in

family of performing artists--his mother a soprano singer and his father
a 
conductor which then widened to include hip hop, DJing and finally, 
electronic music.

Known for crafting a brand of subtle, musical techno, his recorded
output 
ranges across tempo and genre lines, from chilled out affairs with
spacious 
arrangements to pulsating, densely layered, deeply energetic tracks that

work magnificently in the hands of DJs as well as on the home stereo. 
Earlier on, his music found release on labels such as A13, Multiplex and

Generation R&S. Following on to those successes, he established his own 
imprint, Palette, in Los Angeles, in 1996, and has enjoyed seven years
of 
steady growth and recognition. The label has served as an exclusive
outlet 
for his own prodigious output but has recently begun to expand its
roster. 
He has also continued to record for other labels such as Plug Research, 
Seventh City, Moods and Grooves, deFocus, Sino and others, often in 
collaboration with 12 year long collaborator Arian Leviste, and
alongside 
these numerous singles, has also produced eight albums; two for A13,
Palette 
and one each for deFocus, Plug Research, Moods and Grooves and
Playhouse. 
John's Cleveland shows are always amazing events and we expect nothing
less 
from him this time.

Warm Art is a global experiment dedicated to entertaining and educating 
world dancefloors with the intelligent sides of techno, house, electro,
and 
experimental beats.  The Warm Art collective contains djs and producers 
located throughout the world, including Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Los

Angeles, Seattle, London, Norway, and Dubai.  Abbasso Underground Lounge
in 
Cleveland hosts Warm Art on the second saturday of each month.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} nrr: foreign auto repair shop in cleveland


My buddie dave specializes in forign cars.  He just moved shops like
last week, I'll forward you some info as soon as I get ahold of him.  I
left him a message for him to call me back.  He can fix anything.  When
we were kids, he took apart his vw engine entirely and rebuilt it in his
bedroom lol.  He's all into volvo turbos now, but hes being working in
forign car repair for like 10 years.  I think his new shop does just
that.

Subject: {pb-cle} new pix

heres some pix from the arabica in akron and mazi at abbasso
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/arabica_abbasso
mazi was a totally unexpected surprise.  i went expecting deep house and 
figured it'd be something to do, maybe see some friends and such, but 
about 30-40 mins after getting there, the set totally changed to 
techno.  all sorts of techno.  this dood was all over the map, acid, 
booty, sweedish stuff, detroit.... just all over the map.... and it worked.

and heres some pix from a bit back, a month or 2 ago, but the yinzers 
will like em.

You may have something there.

"I'm a good for nothing stoner without a job.  I can't afford to make
long distance phone calls.  That's why I use 10-10-420.  It will cost
the people I'm calling a bunch of money but it free for me and I always
remember the number; even when I can't remember the number of the person
I'm calling.  And think of how much more weed you can buy with the money
you save.  So next time you're stoned and want to call someone just
remember 10-10-420."

There is no pavillion or area with grills, but you _can_ build a fire
anywhere on our part of the property.  The goahead stage and the BBM stage
both start @ 2pm on Saturday, so maybe before that in one of those areas?

German penises 'too small for EU condoms' 

Germany has demanded a rethink on EU guidelines on condom size after finding its average penis did not measure up.

Doctors around Essen were ordered by the government's health department to check out the average size suggested by Brussels.

They reported the EU has overestimated the size of the average penis by almost 20% and insist other countries will discover the same.

Urologist Gunther Hagler, head of the team compiling the research, said: "By checking hundreds of patients we found German penises were too small for standard EU condoms.

"On average they were 14.48 cms long and 3.95 cms wide. That makes them much smaller than the EU standard condom size of 17 cms in length and 5.6 cms in width."

He denied the German man was any smaller than the rest of Europe, adding: "We think the EU has got its sums wrong, and if other countries were to check out their men's assets they would find the EU has made a mistake in its calculations.

"There should be a rethink and the EU statisticians should check their figures again. After all, they have also ruled EU standard condoms should be able to hold 18 litres of fluid without breaking, which also seems a bit excessive."

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Lucky I'm female

The last line is by far one of the funniest things I have read in quite a 
while. 18 liters of fluid? That's over four gallons. Think about it for just 
a second. That should make an indication that the average length of almost 7 
inches is a little on the high side.

I am just curious to see how many countries are willing to do what Germany 
did, and how many will express false pride in their claims that these 
numbers aren't big enough. ''Here in Spain, even our smallest men are a 
majestic 25cm in length...puny Germans!"

    we'll most likely bring the red devil, but it's
    not going to stand up to cooking for more than
    4 people at a time, which is why i was hoping
    we could find a pavillion or some type of
    grills. i thought this was a regular campground
    with grammas and all :]

    we can always cook on a fire with tinfoil.

    more later..

Subject: {pb-cle} Last minute FD2 questions...

ok, so I guess last minute would mean friday, but at any rate.....

Can you walk to and from your car as much as you want?  That way I 
can keep all my spare camera batts and stuff in the car and not have 
to lug a bag around.

Since there's a $5 (i'll say minimum since I'm sure some people will 
give more) fee, can you still leave and come back throughout the 
weekend?

Are there any stores near the area?  For when I need more ice for my 
cooler and stuff. (btw, I'm looking at downing 24 bottles of beer 
throughout the party, muwahaha, unless alcohol is prohibited and is 
going to be actively enforced or something...)

This one is going to sound really stupid, but are there bathrooms 
here?  In a past post I saw something about us not being able to use 
any of the facilities.  Is that a "technical" issue, and we can 
"unofficially" use them or do we have to just find a tree somewhere?  
This goes back to the other questions about a store and can leave any 
time stuff since I don't plan on taking a dump in the woods :)

:i: have a lot of questions :)

I hope that works... go down to the album marked Stanley Cup.

All of my rave pics are back there now too. I'm going back to using yahoo
photos now, I can't upload toPbase anymore (thanks Ray G for the tip on
that) and I have a bunch of new space on yahoo to use up. All my new pics
gotta go on yahoo so I have organized it for the FD 2 pics I get this
weekend. Luke if you read this expect a call from me soon, bro. I figure you
might need a hand with something or someone might need a ride.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Burning Man

Luke,

I am curious (I just read this email after 3 months of not being able to
access my email .. it's a long story :/ ), are you (or anyone you know of)
planning on attending BM?  I am searching for solutions to my current
transportation situation.  Drop me a line at monkey@slackworks.com if you
can.  Thanks!!

Hopefully see you this weekend at FieldDay.  I will have my equipment
there, assuming I make it out in time.  How long of a drive do you think
it is from Pittsburgh to the venue?  I am going to Kennywood daytime
Saturday (depending on weather) for my birthday.

-Jesse

this issue came up with someone else today...

if you had an email account under wizardworkshop that you haven't been able 
to access lately, email me privately at alan@downlow.net and i'll give you 
instructions on how to get into it.  this would also go for anyone who had 
a domain hosted on the wizardworkshop box with email under that domain as 
well.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

saturday, august 23
SEAN CUSICK
(bedrock, balance, hallucination, saw)

Sean Cusick's definitive blend of psychedelic house and techno has firmly
established him as a globally recognized DJ and producer. His unique range
of intoxicating music has put him in demand behind the decks from Tokyo to
Prague. As a producer, you've seen his work under guises such as Second
Hand Satellites with DJ Three on Hallucination/Shaboom Records and
Freelance Icebreakers with Jimmy Van M. He recently collaborated with
Medway on "Neutrix" for Saw Recordings and is currently producing a
full-length album on the Viscous label out of Manchester. Recently, John
Digweed used Sean's "Of Course" for his MMII mix cd and subsequently
signed the track to his Bedrock label under the name Sean Q6. On top of
all this, Sean also pens a monthly column for xpander 
[ http://www.xpander.nl ], filling it with his unique brand of scathing
humor and "shoot from the hip" attitude.

PHREAKY DEAKY 3
Saturday, August 23, 2003
Dayton, Ohio, USA, Earth

Featuring...


D J B A M B A M
Contamin8ted / Jackstar / Topaz / Chicago
Experience the hard, jackin beats of the turntable intoxicator. Some call 
him Mr. Bigfoot, others a windy city wizard of wax, but most will 
recognize this sorcerer of sound as DJ Bam Bam. Utilizing his musical 
aptness, Bam Bam has touched audiences worldwide. For the last nine years, 
he has been directly involved in and thus accredited for increasing 
awareness and popularity of hard Chicago techno/hard house music.

J O S H "T H E F U N K Y 1"
Funktion / Mix Connection / Kid Dynamite / Chicago
A DJ for over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, 
tech-house and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable 
tricks. 1997 saw Josh become a DMC Midwest Finalist. In 1999 he competed 
in the Winter Music Conference scratching competition where he was a 
runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In 2000 Josh took 1st place 
in the beat-mixing competition at the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off. 
Aside from competing, Joshs passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which 
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh 
has also helped co-produce legendary Bad Boy Bills "Bangin the Box Vol. 
4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

M I X I N' M A R C
B96 / SHR Group / Logic / Static Brothers / Chicago
Currently dividing his time between his hometown of Chicago and gigs in 
such places as Cancun and New York City, Mixin Marc is requested by his 
fans time and time again. Not just an experienced club resident, Marc 
pumps the crowd at raves all across the country. Guest spots with other 
heavyweights in the scene include Dave Ralph, Frankie Bones, DJ Skribble, 
Richard Humpty Vision, Charles Feelgood and B96 jock Bad Boy Bill. 
Recently headlining alongside DJ Irene and Armand Van Helden, Mixin' Marc 
has received praise not only for his abilities, but also for his demeanor. 
A professional to the core, music is his life... and his passion. Now 
working into 2001, expect only the best from Mixin' Marc... and that's 
exactly what you'll receive. Top of the line bangin' club hits, a blend of 
rich trance with a touch of domestic and European techno.

F A D E
www.poopiehead.net / www.djfade.com / Milwaukee
Originally from Madison, WI, Fade has been on the leading edge of the
Midwest breakbeat movement. Busy with two weekly internet broadcasts,
www.club246.com, and www.ravetrax.com, he is also one of the founding
fathers of Madison's premiere breaks night, "Magnetic" at the King Klub,
and the breaks buyer at Milwaukee's Trounce Records. Known for his
intense, bass-throbing breaks, Fade is quickly gaining recognition as one
of the Midwest's favorite breaks djs.

Inner Child House Collective:

Inner Child strives to showcase the highest caliber of talent to the
Pittsburgh area: artists new to the local scene, and artists which have
not been here for many years.  With the success of iPhunk in November of
2002, and the prior success of the groundbreaking event, Phunkadelik, in
April of 2000, Inner Child has been progressing through the local
Pittsburgh scene as a collective that is truly dedicated to the music,
which we all lovenot the politics.  Two solid weeklies at the infamous
dejAVu lounge, Mango and Agave, have proved to the local scene the
compatibility of multiple genres, while expressing all styles of House
music.  Mango has been a force to reckon with, entertaining at least 700
or more guests every Saturday, featuring the finest local and regional
talent while providing an upscale and plush atmosphere.  Agave, our newest
brainchild, combines the best underground House music with other
compatible dance genres.  Inner Child is now proud to offer Pittsburgh,
the surrounding areas, all who have supported us in the past, and all who
wish to support us now and in the future, an event of such simple ideas
yet such massive proportions. We hope to bring out the Inner Child in
all who attend! Prepare yourself for PHUNKTIFIED!

 

Happy Birthday Ova, Ian, and Jenn!

techno artists that are taking the world by storm. Their releases are 
already touching down on influential record  labels, and are being played 
by A-list DJ's around the globe.  This is their first performance in Ohio

V O I G T : K A M P F F    [LIVE]

Zeropointrecords.com _ Cincinnati _ Live Drum & Bass

Emmit & Beethead, of the wildly successful Twilight Sleep orchestra, have 
formed a new force that is arguably one of the best live Drum & Bass acts 
this side of the Atlantic.  Also the driving force behind Gravity Bass, 
they have played an integral role in promoting world class electronic

explosives and you have Imperial Sound System.
 

J A M E S : J O H N S O N   a.k.a   D I V I N E

Invisible Sounds _ Dayton

"If you ain't gonna beat it, you better stay home". These are words every 
DJ should live by, and J.J. is a true example of the jaw dropping effect 
this mentality brings to the floor.  Think Roc Raida meets Claude Young 
turntablism and uncompromising track selection.  This is a long overdue 
appearance, and were ecstatic to bring this outstanding DJ to electrify 
the crowd at 'Techncolour'.

Normally associated with his peers in Techno from Detroit, Europe and
elsewhere in the US and the world, John Tejada has embraced electronic
music as a personal frontier, expanding on his formidable resume as a
Techno recording artist as producer and remixer, DJ, and label owner. With
dozens of singles, remixes, some film and TV work and contributions to
sample CDs to his credit, this recent expansion has born a slew of tracks
deeply informed by his uncompromised aesthetic honed over years of
diligent production which finds its roots in Detroit Techno but references
a far broader range of music, both in and outside of electronic music. His
musically formative years were steeped in Classical music, growing up in
family of performing artists--his mother a soprano singer and his father a
conductor which then widened to include hip hop, DJing and finally,
electronic music.

Known for crafting a brand of subtle, musical techno, his recorded output
ranges across tempo and genre lines, from chilled out affairs with
spacious arrangements to pulsating, densely layered, deeply energetic
tracks that work magnificently in the hands of DJs as well as on the home
stereo.  Earlier on, his music found release on labels such as A13,
Multiplex and Generation R&S. Following on to those successes, he
established his own imprint, Palette, in Los Angeles, in 1996, and has
enjoyed seven years of steady growth and recognition. The label has served
as an exclusive outlet for his own prodigious output but has recently
begun to expand its roster.  He has also continued to record for other
labels such as Plug Research, Seventh City, Moods and Grooves, deFocus,
Sino and others, often in collaboration with 12 year long collaborator
Arian Leviste, and alongside these numerous singles, has also produced
eight albums; two for A13, Palette and one each for deFocus, Plug
Research, Moods and Grooves and Playhouse.  John's Cleveland shows are
always amazing events and we expect nothing less from him this time.

Warm Art is a global experiment dedicated to entertaining and educating
world dancefloors with the intelligent sides of techno, house, electro,
and experimental beats.  The Warm Art collective contains djs and
producers located throughout the world, including Atlanta, Chicago,
Cleveland, Los Angeles, Seattle, London, Norway, and Dubai.  Abbasso
Underground Lounge in Cleveland hosts Warm Art on the second saturday of
each month.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he is mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that

Well, we're not going to be there until Saturday night now. We have to go to this other thing during the day ...something that we thought was going to be on Sunday. So I'll have to miss out on the 4:20 potluck, which sucks because I was really looking forward to eating one of my CDG brats ...

I'm not sure when I'm getting there, I know at the very latest that 
I'm leaving at 8:00 AM or so on Sunday because of a freaking family 
reunion I don't even want to go to.  No clue when I'm getting 
there/what I'm going to bring/etc.  Any updates on the grill 
situation (is someone going to bring one)?  Might just bring a bag of 
hamburgers or something.

Yep. Cleveland and parts of Akron are dark (well, would be dark if it were night time). Luckily, Cuyahoga Falls still has power for some reason.

See everyone there.  I will be there early tomorrow
setting up the Experimedia / Headroom / Molotov stage
and be there all weekend.  Looking forward to it.  
We will be broadcasting the stages happenings all
weekend on an FM radio band yet to be decided and it
will reach about 5 miles in every direction. Plus you
can listen in your cars during the festival Pump Up
The Volume style. We will have a band picked tonight
and I will try to let everyone know what it is.

Drive safe.

Subject: {pb-cle} Field Day~Blackouts

What the shit , I was at Poo bas trying to buy some new vinyl and the whole 
east coast power grid decides to take a shit, just my luck!  So all I want 
to know is if Field Day is stil going on.  And god do I hope the water 
doesn't shut off cuz there's gonna be a reall nasty smell out there soon if 
noone can take a shower.  Ok well it's about to get dark outside and I could 
really use a couple new tv's and maybe a new computer.

Looter, I mean Later,
Matt

Subject: {pb-cle} Real FD2 last minute questions

This is a simple one.  Has anyone figured if they are going to bring 
a grill to this?  Saw a few posts about it earlier in the week but 
never really heard any confirmations.  Need to know if can bring 
cookable stuff (burgers, mainly) or just bring some sandwiches.

btw, it looks like I might get there late friday night, maybe.  Still 
depends if I get everything together or not.

I went into work this morning and they told us to go back home.  They 
had electricity, but no water.  #@$@#$#@  They couldn't have said 
this before.  Then I wouldn't have had to get up so freaking early.  
O well.  That would be cool if I can't go to my other job either, 
which is also in twinsburg, although it borders macedonia, and not 
sure if they're having water problems or not.

My work just called - no power, but they wanted me to come in anyway so I could harrass some California appraisers who are way overdue on some appraisals. My work is so riveting.

Anyway, I'm still not going because my cat is really sick and I'm taking him to the vet. He's just been sitting in the same spot for two days and not eating. If he dies, I will never forgive myself for not keeping him updated on his shots ...I'm a very bad mommy cat ...

    we live on w28th and detroit - our power came back
    on about 7 this morning.

    the view last night was fucking awesome. between
    the moon and the stars, cleveland looked really beautiful.
    granted, there were the flashing lights of the cops
    directing traffic on w25 / detroit :]

    i was a little annoyed to see the brown's stadium all
    lit up, and the federal building sure has lots of emergency
    power. not enough power to keep the sewage out of
    lake erie, or run water, but enough power to play a game
    of football by..

    silliness.

that blackout was fucking awesome!  ive never seen such a starry nite in the
city(too bad the moon was fucking brite)...all of cleveland was shutdown
except all the hole in the wall bars...bar hopping on skateboard is fucking
fun! the best part of it all was even the police were cool....3 cops stopped
me on my way home(i was on skateboard) and none of them hassled me...one
even had a shot of chivas with me

I live in Westlake just off of Detroit & Bassett, and my power came back on 
around 4:00 this morning.  A friend of mine who also lives in Westlake, off of 
Center Ridge & Crocker STILL doesn't have power.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} blackouts?!

I understand the part about running water to town from the 5 mile inlet, but 
does a blackout really result in raw sewage dumping directly into Lake Erie? 
That's revolting! You'd think modern technology could design something along 
the lines of, oh I don't know, a holding tank!

    we live on w28th and detroit - our power came back
    on about 7 this morning.

    the view last night was fucking awesome. between
    the moon and the stars, cleveland looked really beautiful.
    granted, there were the flashing lights of the cops
    directing traffic on w25 / detroit :]

    i was a little annoyed to see the brown's stadium all
    lit up, and the federal building sure has lots of emergency
    power. not enough power to keep the sewage out of
    lake erie, or run water, but enough power to play a game
    of football by..

    silliness.

Since I am very familiar with the area where FD2 is being held, if anyone needs 
a ride into town for anything, just ask me, and as long as I am in a sober 
state of mind, I can take you. :)

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} blackouts?!

I live downtown and Brent and I sat on the roof last night to watch VERY
DARK AND SCARY downtown. About 1am some lights were beginning to come
back on...including jacob's field. it was so incredible to sit there and
watch building by building light up!!!!

The power came back on at 10.30am today at my apartment [E30th and
Prospect]. I have nothing to do. I work at cleveland state university
and  it's completely closed. Damn. Maybe I'll trek out to someone's
house with my dirty clothes. Not a bad day to wash.


----not to forget the sky last night downtown. You could see every
star!!!! That's never happened before!!!!! What a freaking awesome and
crazy day yesterday!

Yeah, I went to work and NASA GLEN is shut down, gates closed, and even
our home base office personel just outside the gates were told to go
home.  The networks down for security reason so there's little to do
with stand alone machines.  Looks like I may head to FDII early then.
Hope to see some people I know, I'll be going by my self but probably
having friends head there probably tomorrow if not tonight.  If you're
headed there early and don't mind a freak to hang with hit me back.

The stars were cool last night, unfortunately surrounding south suburb
towns got power on so the galactic plane was not very easy to see for
me, but I heard that in Lakewood it was very good viewing.  I still saw
a great many more starts and planet(s) than normal.  Good thing I was
prepared to go camping cause I was able to throw a 6v flashlight rave
and get around last night.

Yeah be careful about back flow in the water system - wallmarts and
kmart still have pleanty of bottled water jugs and cases of bottles, but
I'd get there soon.  Limit 4 per person in the Cleveland area I've seen
so far.

Hieneken oil cans are yummy!

I went into work this morning and they told us to go back home.  They 
had electricity, but no water.  #@$@#$#@  They couldn't have said 
this before.  Then I wouldn't have had to get up so freaking early.  
O well.  That would be cool if I can't go to my other job either, 
which is also in twinsburg, although it borders macedonia, and not 
sure if they're having water problems or not.

raw sewage(piss and shit) isnt really that bad for the lake...compared to
what the inustries in the flats dump into the lake and river its really no
big deal...piss and shit is actually organic, and it will breakdown pretty
quickly...anyways...better the dump it into the lake than have it backup
into our homes

it... like just about everything... comes down to cold hard $$$, they are
not going to cancel an NFL game (preseason or not) and lose all that loot
(parking, concessions, surrounding businesses, etc...) not to mention the
tickets they would have to refund, it could cost millions for the city and
the league. Just like in baseball they usually wait as long as possible
during rain because every time a game is ppd. literally millions of $$$ are
lost. I'm not saying this is right b.t.w.

 Actually I have heard of some reports of people losing power again and some
brown outs so we may still have a problem. Anyone else hearing that???

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} blackouts?! + Browns game

First Energy's press release says they're still out a few power generation
plants and due to the failure we're pretty much on our own, so if they
shortfall on generation and we have a high usage they'll have to impliment
rolling blackouts to keep the power up.  Basically we could find ourselves
out for 4 hour windows if they need to shut areas down to keep the power
consumption under control, basically everyone takes a turn until the power
comes back online...

I don't agree.  My gf worked for the pennsylvania EPA doing computerized 
mapping of the sewer system in the pittsburgh area (what fun!) and she said 
that since in many municipalities the sanitary sewer and storm sewers run 
together. Whenever there is a large rainfall and the sewers get overloaded, 
(which happens all the time out here) it just flows onto the streets and 
into the rivers.  (Yes, there is shit flowing on the streets of pittsburgh, 
folks. and the rivers too.)  Its so bad, that the city forbids swimming in 
any of the rivers.

Moreover, pgh has a high fecal coliform count (a measure of e coli bacteria 
only found in human feces).  Being a chemist, i know that most of the nasty 
industrial shit is not water soluble, nor does it reproduce.  I think that 
fecal bacteria and the other shit that goes along with it is MUCH worse 
than industrial waste.  You never saw industrial waste grow did ya? 
(although, i'm sure there was much more industrial waste dumped into lake 
erie than human waste.)

SO, in the end.  I wouldn't worry about the industrial waste, just don't 
eat fish that live in the polluted water.  Poop, however is dangerous!

BS

I hope the organizers of Field Day already have the generators they reserved for the weekend....


Else, they may find themselves on the short end.

Good luck, guys/gals.

Have fun. Be young. Drink booze.

First Energy's press release says they're still out a few power generation
plants and due to the failure we're pretty much on our own, so if they
shortfall on generation and we have a high usage they'll have to impliment
rolling blackouts to keep the power up.  Basically we could find ourselves
out for 4 hour windows if they need to shut areas down to keep the power
consumption under control, basically everyone takes a turn until the power
comes back online...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} blackouts?! + Browns game

    uhh, i didn't say they were playing football,
    just that they had enough light to.

    this was about 11pm, fwiw.

    the power is still spotty. the light at w25th and
    bridge is on and off. my ups keeps beeping at
    me, but nothing else is going down.

    anyway..

    as for field day and a netmeet, i'll just see some
    people there. it would be nice to have a cookout,
    but i don't see that happening.

    we can have a pow-wow at 420 at the drum circle.

    sunrise, here i come!

    :]

the game is tonight... my guess is that backup generators were being =
tested
in case the power goes down tonight during the game which obviously =
could be
a disaster... I think they should cancel the game... it is stupid, even =
if
the stadium is fine if there is another blackout you want as few peeps
downtown as possible.

Oh well we wont care out there in the woods... I plan on showing up very
late tonight/tomorrow morning.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} blackouts?! + Browns game


I heard 13 to 9 nuclear power plants went down due to not having outside
power, that's a considerable contribution to the power grid.  Anyone
know how long those take to go back up?  Good thing it's the weekend.

First Energy's press release says they're still out a few power
generation
plants and due to the failure we're pretty much on our own, so if they
shortfall on generation and we have a high usage they'll have to
impliment
rolling blackouts to keep the power up.  Basically we could find
ourselves
out for 4 hour windows if they need to shut areas down to keep the power
consumption under control, basically everyone takes a turn until the
power
comes back online...

We stopped at Wal mart in Streetsboro this morning and they had no water
or ice.  Was supposed to come in at 2:00 AM...  That was around 7:00, so
not sure what the status is there now.  need to get ice for my cooler. 
Also want to stop at the grocery store for some food, unless I just bring
some burgers or something.

POWER OUTAGE TRACED TO DIM BULB IN WHITE HOUSE --- THE TALE OF THE BRITS WHO SWIPED 800 JOBS FROM NEW YORK, CARTED OFF $90 MILLION, THEN TONIGHT, TURNED OFF OUR LIGHTS 
by Greg Palast
Palast is author of the New York Times bestseller, "The Best Democracy Money Can Buy" (Penguin USA) and the worstseller, "Democracy and Regulation," a guide to electricity deregulation published by the United Nations (with T. MacGregor and J. Oppenheim).
 
I can tell you all about the ne're-do-wells that put out our lights tonight. I came up against these characters -- the Niagara Mohawk Power Company -- some years back. You see, before I was a journalist, I worked for a living, as an investigator of corporate racketeers. In the 1980s, "NiMo" built a nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point, a brutally costly piece of hot junk for which NiMo and its partner companies charged billions to New York State's electricity ratepayers. 
To pull off this grand theft by kilowatt, the NiMo-led consortium fabricated cost and schedule reports, then performed a Harry Potter job on the account books. In 1988, I showed a jury a memo from an executive from one partner, Long Island Lighting, giving a lesson to a NiMo honcho on how to lie to government regulators. The jury ordered LILCO to pay $4.3 billion and, ultimately, put them out of business.
And that's why, if you're in the Northeast, you're reading this by candlelight tonight. Here's what happened. After LILCO was hammered by the law, after government regulators slammed Niagara Mohawk and dozens of other book-cooking, document-doctoring utility companies all over America with fines and penalties totaling in the tens of billions of dollars, the industry leaders got together to swear never to break the regulations again. Their plan was not to follow the rules, but to ELIMINATE the rules. They called it "deregulation."
It was like a committee of bank robbers figuring out how to make safecracking legal.
But they dare not launch the scheme in the USA. Rather, in 1990, one devious little bunch of operators out of Texas, Houston Natural Gas, operating under the alias "Enron," talked an over-the-edge free-market fanatic, Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, into licensing the first completely deregulated power plant in the hemisphere. 
And so began an economic disease called "regulatory reform" that spread faster than SARS. Notably, Enron rewarded Thatcher's Energy Minister, one Lord Wakeham, with a bushel of dollar bills for 'consulting' services and a seat on Enron's board of directors. The English experiment proved the viability of Enron's new industrial formula: that the enthusiasm of politicians for deregulation was in direct proportion to the payola provided by power companies. 
The power elite first moved on England because they knew Americans wouldn't swallow the deregulation snake oil easily. The USA had gotten used to cheap power available at the flick of switch. This was the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt who, in 1933, caged the man he thought to be the last of the power pirates, Samuel Insull. Wall Street wheeler-dealer Insull creator of the Power Trust, and six decades before Ken Lay, faked account books and ripped off consumers. To frustrate Insull and his ilk, FDR gave us the Federal Power Commission and the Public Utilities Holding Company Act which told electricity companies where to stand and salute. Detailed regulations limited charges to real expenditures plus a government-set profit. The laws banned "power markets" and required companies to keep the lights on under threat of arrest -- no blackout blackmail to hike rates. 
Of particular significance as I write here in the dark, regulators told utilities exactly how much they had to spend to insure the system stayed in repair and the lights stayed on. Bureaucrats crawled along the wire and, like me, crawled through the account books, to make sure the power execs spent customers' money on parts and labor. If they didn't, we'd whack'm over the head with our thick rule books. Did we get in the way of these businessmen's entrepreneurial spirit? Damn right we did. 
Most important, FDR banned political contributions from utility companies -- no 'soft' money, no 'hard' money, no money PERIOD.
But then came George the First. In 1992, just prior to his departure from the White House, President Bush Senior gave the power industry one long deep-through-the-teeth kiss good-bye: federal deregulation of electricity. It was a legacy he wanted to leave for his son, the gratitude of power companies which ponied up $16 million for the Republican campaign of 2000, seven times the sum they gave Democrats.
But Poppy Bush's gift of deregulating of wholesale prices set by the feds only got the power pirates halfway to the plunder of Joe Ratepayer. For the big payday they needed deregulation at the state level. There were only two states, California and Texas, big enough and Republican enough to put the electricity market con into operation.
California fell first. The power companies spent $39 million to defeat a 1998 referendum pushed by Ralph Nadar which would have blocked the de-reg scam. Another $37 million was spent on lobbying and lubricating the campaign coffers of legislators to write a lie into law: in the deregulation act's preamble, the Legislature promised that deregulation would reduce electricity bills by 20%. In fact, when San Diegans in the first California city to go "lawless" looked at their bills, the 20% savings became a 300% jump in surcharges.
Enron circled California and licked its lips. As the number one life-time contributor to the George W. Bush campaign, it was confident about the future. With just a half dozen other companies it controlled at times 100% of the available power capacity needed to keep the Golden State lit. Their motto, "your money or your lights." Enron and its comrades played the system like a broken ATM machine, yanking out the bills. For example, in the shamelessly fixed "auctions" for electricity held by the state, Enron bid, in one instance, to supply 500 megawatts of electricity over a 15 megawatt line. That's like pouring a gallon of gasoline into a thimble -- the lines would burn up if they attempted it. Faced with blackout because of Enron's destructive bid, the state was willing to pay anything to keep the lights on. 
And the state did. According to Dr. Anjali Sheffrin, economist with the California state Independent System Operator which directed power movements, between May and November 2000, three power giants physically or "economically" withheld power from the state and concocted enough false bids to cost the California customers over $6.2 billion in excess charges.
It took until December 20, 2000, with the lights going out on the Golden Gate, for President Bill Clinton, once a deregulation booster, to find his lost Democratic soul and impose price caps in California and ban Enron from the market. 
But the light-bulb buccaneers didn't have to wait long to put their hooks back into the treasure chest. Within seventy-two hours of moving into the White House, while he was still sweeping out the inaugural champagne bottles, George Bush the Second reversed Clinton's executive order and put the power pirates back in business in California. Enron, Reliant (aka Houston Industries), TXU (aka Texas Utilities) and the others who had economically snipped California's wires knew they could count on Dubya, who as governor of the Lone Star state cut them the richest deregulation deal in America.
Meanwhile, the deregulation bug made it to New York where Republican Governor George Pataki and his industry-picked utility commissioners ripped the lid off electric bills and relieved my old friends at Niagara Mohawk of the expensive obligation to properly fund the maintenance of the grid system. 
And the Pataki-Bush Axis of Weasels permitted something that must have former New York governor Roosevelt spinning in his wheelchair in Heaven: They allowed a foreign company, the notoriously incompetent National Grid of England, to buy up NiMo, get rid of 800 workers and pocket most of their wages - producing a bonus for NiMo stockholders approaching $90 million. 
Is tonight's black-out a surprise? Heck, no, not to us in the field who've watched Bush's buddies flick the switches across the globe. In Brazil, Houston Industries seized ownership of Rio de Janeiro's electric company. The Texans (aided by their French partners) fired workers, raised prices, cut maintenance expenditures and, CLICK! the juice went out so often the locals now call it, "Rio Dark."
So too the free-market cowboys of Niagara Mohawk raised prices, slashed staff, cut maintenance and CLICK! -- New York joins Brazil in the Dark Ages. 
Californians have found the solution to the deregulation disaster: re-call the only governor in the nation with the cojones to stand up to the electricity price fixers. And unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gov. Gray Davis stood alone against the bad guys without using a body double. Davis called Reliant Corp of Houston a pack of "pirates" --and now he'll walk the plank for daring to stand up to the Texas marauders.
So where's the President? Just before he landed on the deck of the Abe Lincoln, the White House was so concerned about our brave troops facing the foe that they used the cover of war for a new push in Congress for yet more electricity deregulation. This has a certain logic: there's no sense defeating Iraq if a hostile regime remains in California.
Sitting in the dark, as my laptop battery runs low, I don't know if the truth about deregulation will ever see the light --until we change the dim bulb in the White House.

they thought we were alone and i proved them wrong.
 
i know there are about a million people on the international christians list
i post to...500,000 on the democrats list...in addition i also forward to
periodicals in ohio and california, as well as the promotional crus that
i promoted for in ohio...i had been international since 1997 when i was
involved in the pre y2k compliancy project.
 
this is how right before the war on iraq, over the course of one night,
300,000 people on the west coast, 100,000 in new york, 500,000 in
germany, 500,000 in italy, 300,000 in spain, 200,000 in england,
200,000 in france stood up for peace against the war on iraq...all 
through the miracle of the internet and cell phones.
 
just recently we had a free concert/gathering at the park close to
where i live...2,500 people, the largest gathering for that park in
fresno yet...they thought the hippies were dead, but i saw plenty
at the park that night...i also saw something that had fulfilled biblical
prophecy, that night in the sky, there were no stars, save one - the
star of david, the morning star prophesized in revelations for the 
second coming...this is how i know the rapture has started again.
Woodstock was estimated at around 100,000 people...the largest 
amount of people i had ever gathered was 8000 for Family
Affair 3 in Ohio, the record for California is like 15,000 for the K-Rave 
by Los Angeles, over 20,000 had gathered in Miami Florida for the 
Divine Festival before...over a million and a half has gathered in
Berlin, Germany for the Love Parade.
 
the war mongering fascists may have recently been successful
in shutting up us peace loving liberals recently through their 
blasphemies and lies, but the sign has come, things are about to 
change...the Lord is with us...

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Aug. 5) - About 200 people, mostly in their 20s and 30s, crowd into the card section of the Harvard Coop bookstore, pretending to look for a card for ``Bill.''
On cue, they burst into spontaneous applause.
It's another "flash mob'' strike, wherein a crowd, organized by e-mail lists and Web sites, converges in pre-arranged location and performs a wacky, harmless stunt for a few minutes in public.
The crowd then abruptly disappears, leaving bystanders befuddled.
Some participants consider these acts of swarming to be art. Others fancy them social revolution. But for many it's just irreverent, silly fun.
The phenomenon, called smart flocking by some, is spreading across the globe along with the portable digital devices that enable it.
After the original flash mob coalesced in Manhattan less than two months ago, similar 21st century be-ins were staged from Minneapolis to Tokyo to Vienna.
In June, flash-mobbers crowded into a Manhattan Macy's and surrounded a large oriental rug, telling puzzled salespeople they all lived together and wanted the $10,000 ``Love Rug.''
In Rome, hundreds flooded a bookstore, asking employees for imaginary books and authors.
In San Francisco, a flock crossed a busy downtown crosswalk back and forth, waving their arms in the air and spinning in circles, as tourists stared agape.
The Cambridge crowd fascinated Melissa Krodman, a 24-year-old mobber.
``But to get the joke, you had to look at the woman there behind the counter, the expression on her face'' when the crowd materialized out of nowhere, Krodman said.
A flash mob is a lighthearted variation of the ``smart mob'' - people who use digital technology to hastily mobilize, as activists did to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq or cell phone-equipped teenagers simply do to organize their evening on the spur of the moment.
Futurist Howard Rheingold unwittingly inspired the flash-mobbers, with his 2002 book ``Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution,'' which examines how technology redefines social interaction.
Often, anonymous flash mob organizers send out e-mails and post on online ``blogs'' specifying a date and time for swarming. Word spreads quickly. And before you know it, hundreds are in New York's Central Park, making bird sounds.
What inspires participants?
``Everything makes a lot of sense nowadays, a bit too much sense. Then, for 10 minutes, you get to do something completely nonsensical. You get to be a kid for a few minutes,'' said a 30-year-old organizer of the San Francisco mob, who wanted to be known only as ``The Governor.''
Even friends who got his mob ``summonses'' didn't know he was the organizer, he says - and that secrecy is part of what has people hooked.
Only organizers know the details. Participants are told to synchronize their watches and gather in nearby bars, organized in clusters according to their birth month.
Volunteers, who get cues only minutes prior by cell phone, hand out slips of paper with instructions - the precise minute when the mob should appear and disappear.
The slips must be hidden after memorizing instructions and everyone must disperse no later than two minutes after it ends.
``It's all very 'spy novel,' very hush-hush,'' said 34-year-old New York City flash-mobber Fred Hoysted.
Numerous web logs (blogs), chat rooms and Yahoo group lists are devoted to the movement.
As soon as San Francisco blogger Sean Savage started recording flash mob events on his Web site - www.cheesebikini.com - traffic skyrocketed from 350 visitors a day to more than 9,000, he said.
A recent mention on the popular techie site, Slashdot.org, brought even more traffic, crashing Savage's server.
Savage, 31, says the phenomenon empowers citizens in a world controlled by ``Big Government and Big Corporation.''
``This interests people - even if it's frivolous, totally for fun, and doesn't have a label attached to it - because they see something can still happen from the grassroots without any help from the government and corporations,'' said Savage, a computer system designer and analyst at Stanford University.
Rob Zazueta, who is creating an online meeting place - FlockSmart.com - for organizers and wannabe participants, says the practice turns on its head arguments that evolving digital communications tools like text messaging or e-mail are depersonalizing.
``With smart mobs, these same tools that used to push us apart, are now bringing us back together,'' he said.
Zazueta, 28, hopes to see more instant physical gatherings - not of anonymous pranksters but rather of like minds. They could be at a coffee shop to discuss anything from technology, to music to politics.
``It takes the concept of chat rooms,'' he said, ``and brings it into the real world.''

Are Bush, Ashcroft, and Wolfowitz Protecting America or Their Own Regime? 
 
By DOUGLAS VALENTINE 
Adapted from the July 2003 issue of Penthouse Magazine
"The implication or latent threat of terror was sufficient to insure that the people would comply."
William Colby, creator of the CIA's Phoenix Program, which targeted Vietnamese leaders for assassination during the Vietnam War
For those of you believe the war on terror and the violent occupation of Iraq will ensure world peace, you've got another thing coming; and that thing is the illegitimate Bush Regime's homeland security infrastructure.
Let me state the point of this article up front: The war on terror, and its "homeland security" counterpart, are flip sides of the same coin. They are the same ideology applied to foreign and domestic policy. But like CIA agent Alden Pyle in The Quiet American, their evil intention is wrapped in a complex matrix of transparent lies. Pointedly, that evil intention is to provide the Bush Regime with political internal security at home, thus enabling it to plunder the world with impunity.
The foreign policy aspect of this synthesis was promulgated on September 20, 2002 in the "The National Security Strategy of the United States" (a.k.a. the Bush Manifesto) in which the Bush Regime confers upon itself the divine right to devastate any nation it dislikes, or has vast oil fields or other natural resources that it covets. This first-degree-murder strategy makes about 70 percent of Americans feel good about Bush. But Bush has an insidious ulterior motive, and if these feel-good Americans were to read the fine print of his Manifesto, they would realize that by generating more human misery around the world, the eternal war on terror will create more dissenters at home, and thus provide Bush with the mandate he needs to impose a de facto military dictatorship, as prescribed in his domestic policy statements: the Homeland Security, Patriot, and Domestic Security Enhancement Acts.
Just as waging war around the world is popular, so too will be suppressing domestic dissent. For example, Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly recently had to defend himself when he said war protesters were "un-American." His producers made him do some fast backpedaling, but the Big Mouth was expressing the true feelings of most of his listeners. The airwaves and editorial columns bombard the public with the Bill Riley message, and that is how peace activists go from being bad Americans to being enemies of the state. And that is how the war on terror translates into a homeland security infrastructure that suppresses dissent.
The Shell Game
Homeland Security is a euphemism for internal security, but that phrase has the nasty ring of McCarthyism to it, and the anti-Communist witch-hunts of the 1950s, led by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and racist Senator James Eastland's Internal Security Subcommittee. Before the neo-cons got hooked on terror, America's hawks were obsessed with Godless Communism. Hoover devoted his life to destroying every Communist in America, while the Dulles brothers (CIA Director Allen and Secretary of State John) harnessed the mania and used it as a convenient pretext for Cold War foreign intervention, and laid the foundation stones for the American empire after World War II. In the same way, Bush's anal obsession with terror is the new contrived pretext for solidifying world domination. But as Hoover, Eastland, and the Dulles' knew, without political internal security, Bush cannot wage war abroad, with all the economic benefits that entails.
So Bush, with the help of Joe Lieberman, the Senator from Israel, created the Department Homeland Security to pacify (a euphemism for terrorize) the American people into submission through a number of ploys. This homeland security boondoggle is the biggest reorganization of the U.S. government in 50 years. It might even bankrupt the country and, perhaps intentionally, throw it into a Depression. That remains to be seen. What is certain is that at a cost of $50 billion in taxpayer's money, the homeland security infrastructure will provide Bush with 170,000 political cadres, and the internal security he needs to assure the continuity of his political power indefinitely. Except for providing Bush with political internal security, there is no need for the Department of Homeland Security; it is a Trojan Horse through which Bush will unleash his ideological storm troopers and exploit his ill-gotten power to achieve permanent political dominance.
And he is creating this police state through terror. As the Homeland Security web site assures us, the threat of terrorism "is a permanent condition" that "requires our country to design a new homeland security structure."
Terror as an Organizing Principle of Society
The underlying principle of homeland security (and the war on terror) is that terror is an organizing principle of society. This includes every type of terror, from the shock and awe bombs that liberated Baghdad, to the collective punishments Israel used to crush the Palestinian soul. It's armed propaganda in the form of National Guardsmen eye-balling us at airports, and it's the greatest psywar campaign ever waged, in the form of red white and blue color-coded warnings of terror attacks that never occur, and unsubstantiated reports brought to you by government stenographers at network news.
Terror is the underlying concept. In "Metaphoric Entrapment In Time," researcher Anthony Judge tells how the new homeland security infrastructure is actually an act of "structural violence."
"Personal violence is for the amateur in dominance," Judge notes, quoting two-time Nobel Prize winner Johan Galtung, but "structural violence is the tool of the professional. The amateur who wants to dominate uses guns; the professional uses social structure. The legal criminality of the social system and its institutions, of government, and of individuals at the interpersonal level is tacit violence. Structural violence is a structure of exploitation and social injustice."
Now that the Department of Homeland Security has been voted into law, Bush has laid the groundwork for America's new legally criminal social structure, which exploits on both personal and professional levels. This confluence blesses Bush with omnipotence. He is all-powerful. As he said before sacrificing the Iraqis on the altar of his apotheosis: "We have concluded that tomorrow is a moment of truth for the world."
Delusions of grandeur? A messiah syndrome? Penis envy? What gives?
Justice as Terror
Administrative detention is the extralegal nail upon which the forthcoming legally criminal homeland security structure hangs. It is a neat way of avoiding the Bill of Rights and the Geneva Conventions by creating "crimes of status." Administrative detention was first used by the CIA in the Vietnam War through the notorious Phoenix "assassination" Program, and was applied against Communists, Nationalists, and anyone else opposing the puppet US puppet regime, just as CIA death squads are operating now in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sympathizing with the Communists was a crime of status, as was advocating peace.
Administrative detention is structural violence for the professionals. At the personal level, the terror as an organizing principle of society relies on selective terror, which means destroying one's political opposition through acts of terror directed at individuals. It derives from the Eye of God technique, which plays on primitive fears of an all-seeing cosmic Eye of God that sees into your mind. It was used in World War One by morale officers who sent pilots in small aircraft to fly over enemy camps to call out the names of individual soldiers. CIA psywar expert Ed Lansdale, Graham Greene's model for Alden Pyle in The Quiet American, used this technique in the Philippines in the early 1950s. At night a psywar team would creep into town and paint an eye (like the one that appears atop the pyramid in the Great Seal of the United States) on the wall of a house facing a suspected Communist or Communist sympathizer.
In South Vietnam the Eye of God trick took a ghastly twist. CIA officer Pat McGarvey recalled to Seymour Hersh that "some psychological warfare [psywar] guy in Washington thought of a way to scare the hell out of villagers. When we killed the VC there, they wanted us to spread eagle the guy, put out his eye, cut a hole in the back [of his head] and put his eye in there. The idea was that fear was a good weapon." Likewise, ears were cut off corpses and nail to houses to let the people know that big brother was listening as well. When Viet Cong leaders were found, Phoenix teams murdered and mutilated them along with their families and neighbors as a means of terrorizing the neighboring population into a state of submission. Such horrendous acts were, for propaganda purposes, often made to look as if they had been committed by the enemy. To spread the word that everyone was a potential victim, CIA psywar posters pictured a Phoenix with a blacklist trailing from its beak and a snake
 (i.e. a Communist) grasped in one of its talons. The message was that the omnipotent CIA selectively snatches its prey, in the most hideous way.
The Bush Regime is locked into this method of selective terror. They want you to think they know everything about you: if you've been bad or good, so to speak. Just remember what happened to Uday Hussein and his brother Qusay, and all the other Iraqis featured on the CIA's popular death cards, which are advertised on the Internet.
The modern manifestation of selective terror is the computerized blacklist - the greatest blackmail scheme ever invented: if you don't do what Bush and his clique want, your name pops up and you're suppressed. Be forewarned, the Bush Regime's blacklists include the INS/State Department's TIPOFF; CAPPS II, which uses credit information and secret databases to assess a person's security risk level each time he or she flies; the "No-Fly" blacklist of peace activists, distributed to airlines by the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration; and local blacklists like the one kept by the Denver police department. You know about these lists. You just don't know about the secret ones, the Bush Regime's enemies list of its most powerful domestic political opponents.
Administrative detention and selective terror work in tandem and depend on informant and surveillance programs that identify, in homeland jargon, "terrorist surrogates" at the grass roots level of society. (Attorney General John Ashcroft's Terrorism Information and Prevention System, a.k.a TIPS, was the short-lived prototype.) This is how it happens: on the basis of a false accusation made by an anonymous homeland informant, counter terror teams will arrest a terrorist surrogate, detain the person indefinitely under administrative detention laws in an interrogation center until he or she dies or defects, or is sent to a military tribunal for disposition. Disposition means permanent detention in some perverse torture chambers like the ones in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Ultimately, the Domestic Security Enhancement Act will allow Ashcroft to secretly incarcerate and deport U.S. citizens without any thought of ensuring them due process of law. Check out what happened to Jose Padilla.
To summarize so far: Blanket surveillance, blacklists, arrests on the word of anonymous informants, the absence of due process through extralegal administrative detention procedures, military tribunals, incarceration, and deportation are the instruments of the homeland security infrastructure, which will coordinate all existing U.S. intelligence, police, and military units in the attack on terrorists and their surrogates.
Ensuring Political Security
Bush is about to devour his domestic enemies at both the tactical (personal) and strategic (professional) levels. Upper echelon enemies will be dealt with by the Homeland Security Council, which Bush chairs, and which does not appear on any organizational chart. It sets policy for a secret political warfare program. It is the greatest danger facing America today. Like the anthrax letters mailed to Democratic senators, it takes only a few "black propaganda" operations to suppress the leaders of the political opposition. Private contactors may carry out executive actions (what the Israelis fondly refer to as "targeted kills") issued by this all-powerful Board of Directors, as they are not accountable to Congress. Or Bush will employ political action squads from the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, which consists of the FBI and CIA's terror experts, and reports only to Bush.
Tactically Bush will neutralize opponents through the Department of Homeland Security, which consists of four directorates: Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection, Science and Technology, Border and Transportation Security, and Emergency Preparedness and Response. The all-important Office of Intelligence, consisting of about 1000 analysts from dozens of agencies, is cloistered within the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. This Office, insofar as it will coordinate the other directorates in terror operations, is the nerve center of the DHS political internal security infrastructure.
The Office of Intelligence will manage the CIA's domestic action squads, interrogation, and informant programs, and will wag the homeland security dog by coordinating all in-coming intelligence, and then sending out warnings to state, local and private sector officials. Employees from the CIA's Counter-Terror Center will fill the most important positions within the Office of Intelligence, and will plan daily operations in conjunction with fellow CT Center officers posted within 93 Justice Department terrorism task forces run around the country. With the latest electronic surveillance gadgets available to them, they will reach into every corner of society, including our homes, workplaces, public facilities and computers, to sniff out terrorist surrogates and launch preemptive attacks to neutralize them before they activate.
If you don't believe that the blossoming homeland security infrastructure is already providing political internal security, consider that hundreds of businesses and institutions across the country have already been placed on the CIA's Watch List. According to Bob Woodward of the Washington Post, one Bush official said that merely being on the list "could destroy the livelihood of all those organizations...without a bomb being thrown or a spore of anthrax being released."
Elizabeth Becker of the New York Times reported several months ago that "the leaders of many federal departments and agencies have been scrambling to figure out... how they can influence the outcome [of the impending Department of Homeland Security] without appearing disloyal."
And James Bamford noted that "pressure has been building on the intelligence agencies to deliberately slant estimates to fit a political agenda," and "a growing number of military officers, intelligence professionals and diplomats ...charge that the administration squelches dissenting views."
This is the maximum danger of homeland security, and what it boils down to mandatory self-censorship. Already we passively permit hooded paramilitary policemen with automatic rifles to search our cars, without probable cause, for Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. These policemen are helping us, right? They would never turn their guns on us, right?
As stated in a CIA terrorist training manual that came to light almost 20 years ago, "Implicit terror always accompanies weapons, since the people are internally "aware" that they can be used against them."
This is what William Colby was talking about when he was quoted in the prologue to this article as saying, "The implication or latent threat of terror was sufficient to insure that the people would comply."
Creating the Political Cadres
Neo-con Michael Ledeen, a certified homelander, rationalized the use of terror as an organizing principle of society when he said, "New times require new people with new standards." According to Ledeen, these new people have the will power to "stamp out" the "corrupt habits of mind" manifest in the thoughts or actions of anyone who opposes Bush Regime aggression. Says Ledeen, "The entire political world will understand it and applaud it. And it will give [Homeland Security] a chance to succeed, and us to prevail."
On the international scene, these "new people" illegally invaded Iraq, formed a puppet regime of supplitiefs, stole the nation's oil and are putting the profits in their own pockets, and are now assassinating and otherwise terrorizing, through an updated Phoenix Program, any political opposition, in what amounts to mass murder.
Information management is key in creating the "new people" who will organize the new criminal homeland social structure, and make it appear legal, moral and most importantly, popular. The first step in manufacturing these robots is through motivational indoctrination, which is based on the principle that people will do a anything you ask of them if you make them feel special. In return for adopting the right attitude, a successful career is offered. Several alumni from the CIA's Phoenix Program already enjoy important top homeland security posts, like Major General Bruce Lawlor, Chief of Staff of the Department of Homeland Security, and Roger Mackin, the CIA officer in charge of the Department's counter-narcotics center. From mid-1967 until mid-1968, Mackin ran the Phoenix Program in Da Nang City, and managed its Intelligence and Operations Coordination Center - the organizational model for the Department of Homeland Security. Mackin is also touted as the CIA officer who nailed
 Colombian drug smuggler Pablo Escobar in a typical Phoenix assassination operation in December 1993.
CIA psywar experts like Lawlor and Mackin will motivationally indoctrinate the 170,000 some odd homeland security personnel to wage political warfare. A training manual on the subject was reprinted in the early 1980s by a former Phoenix officer who got caught up in the Reagan Regime's illegal Contra War. Titled Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare, it states that "the human being should be considered the priority objective in a political war. And conceived as the military target of guerrilla war, the human being has his most critical point in his mind. Once his mind has been reached, the 'political animal' has been defeated, without necessarily receiving bullets."
Having been politically and motivationally indoctrinated, Critical Infrastructure and other homeland personnel will spy on colleagues who may inadvertently or maliciously serve as terrorist surrogates by publicly or privately revealing information about homeland infrastructure vulnerabilities, such as power grids or computer systems. These cadre will covertly identify and watch terrorist surrogates until it becomes necessary to expose the surrogates in the media. No one will want to be identified, even falsely, as an inadvertent or malicious terrorist surrogate, knowing that they are subject to being "stamped out," as Michael Ledeen suggests. In this way the Bush Regime is organizing its political cadre - Ledeen's "new people" who have been psychologically defeated by the implicit terror around them and, having reverted to the same infantile state of mind occupied by President George W. Bush, have embraced the Fascist principles they've been subliminally indoctrinated with for years
 through the corporate propaganda machine.
These "new people" are fast joining front organizations like the Freedom Corps, the Citizen Corps, Community Emergency Response Teams (which will train kids at school to prepare for the disasters the Bush Regime will surely visit upon America); the Neighborhood Watch Program that will allow the Bush Regime to detain its drunk and disorderly political opponents as terrorist surrogates; and the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), through which enfranchised doctors will monitor patients within the faltering health care system.
Within these front groups are cadres trained "in techniques of persuasion over control of target groups" to support the Bush Regime. In the forthcoming national emergency, these cadres will be mobilized, will attend mass meetings, carry placards, shout slogans as part of a Popular Information Program, appeal to our cultural beliefs through Michael Savage-style radio shows, teach classes on correct thinking, organize subtle but massive screening operations designed to generate defectors, who will in turn to denounce former comrades who spoke ill of the Bush Regime. They will intervene with "problem individuals," and everywhere encourage their neighbors to report the activities of terrorist surrogates by dropping a note addressed to the police in local mailboxes. It's not hard to imagine a few of the most highly motivated cadres getting carried away, grabbing ropes, and forming lynch mobs.
Only five percent of the people need to be organized in this fashion for Bush to wield control over the indifferent ninety percent, and defeat the five percent that form the political resistance. This is why psychological operations are the Bush Regime's No. 1 priority. Case in point: when Bush publicly announced the Department of Homeland Security on 6 June 2002, he stated that the organization's primary mission was to "mobilize and focus... the American people "to accomplish the mission of attacking the enemy where he hides and plans." By which he means his political opponents.
Psywar experts prize "compromise and discreditation" operations like the one the FBI used against Martin Luther King before he was assassinated. Information about his extramarital affairs was leaked, and he was sent a message with the suggestion that he should commit suicide. "There is only one way out for you," the forged document read. "You better take it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self is bared to the nation." Forged documents like the one used against King are an important facet of political blackmail, and are also used to justify false arrests or conceal illegal operations. We have already seen Network News broadcast "edited" videotapes of Osama bin Laden and, in the Afghanistan war, captured (perhaps forged) documents were routinely used as a form of black propaganda to justify military actions that resulted in "collateral" damage.
The greatest example, of course, is Bush's criminal an impeachable use of forged documents to justify the illegal invasion of Iraq. This was an act of treason by the President of the United States, and yet within the new legally criminal homeland security structure, it is business as usual.
We can expect a slew of false rumors from low-level homeland cadre, designed to ruin the reputations of politically incorrect families in their villages and towns, especially environmentalists who pose a threat to Critical Infrastructure corporations. The paranoia that currently infects the Arab-American community will spread until no one is sure who is a spy for the Thought Police. When the national emergency arrives, most likely the forthcoming depression, and the homeland security infrastructure goes on Red Alert, midnight arrests and disappearances into administrative detention centers will become commonplace. Amid the confusion, the CIA will form special units within the 93 terrorism task forces around the country, and other unilateral Phoenix Program-style hit teams will operate under cover of the security forces at their disposal.
The clincher is when the definition of a terrorist surrogate is expanded to include people deemed dangerous to the Public Order, at which point any person can be arrested on criminal charges for political offenses. No specific charge is required; a homelander like Ledeen or Bill O'Rilley will simply accuse someone of disturbing the peace or being un-American The definitions of sedition and treason will grow to include disseminating information about government corruption, or undermining the will of the State by challenging its authority. Calling for civil disobedience will be a really scary threat to the homeland. Cadre in the Office of Cyberspace Security will expose you as a terrorist surrogate for sending sarcastic or satirical emails. How can you prove you were only joking when you blamed Bush for the terror attacks on the World Trade Center, and said Cheney's refusal to investigate proves that Bush did it?
Ultimately, every town will form a Homeland Committee, chaired by a Bush Regime operative who will process confidential reports from concerned citizens about the activities of peaceniks, or people they don't like for personal reasons, such as business competitors. These reports will pass through an ideological filter as they work their way up to the Office of Intelligence and the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, where motivated CIA officers will gleefully pull the plug on environmentalists, people espousing national health care, and anyone challenging to the Bush Regime and the internal security forces that are firmly in its grip.
Beware. Ashcroft has vowed to "employ new tools that ease administrative burdens." However benign he might think he means this, these new tools can allow the government to wage political warfare through implicit and explicit terror. And the government can do it! The Geneva Conventions guarantee protection to civilians in time of war, but do not prohibit a state from interning civilians or subjecting them to emergency detention when such measures are necessary for the security or safety of the state. In this way indefinite detention, torture and summary execution, all carried out without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, are perfectly legal, because they are the result of "administrative procedures" and do not involve a "criminal sentence."
This is what Israel is done to the Palestinians, and this is what the Bush Regime has in store for America through its eternal war on terror: that sad obsession with dominance, itself a sad projection of Bush's feelings of inadequacy, most likely brought upon by his domineering mother Barbara.

The ultra liberalism of Dem rule of the state. 
We give and give and give and everyone wants to come to this state.  I don't know what the governor is thinking that he doesn't have the guts to seal the border.  CA can't afford all these illegals and now there's talk of giving "illegals" driver's license.  I don't get it.... these people are here illegal...they're not citizens, why would you give them a privilege that belongs to a US citizen??   Besides with a driver's license they will need to buy insurance and we all know that they don't carry insurance now . 
---
what the hell are you talking about?!
 
i don't see mexicans mowing down people in the market place!
that was a crazy old republican!
 
all i know is this....i had parking tickets, which i paid off
twice in ohio, and they won't let me get a driver's license
because i am not white!
 
everybody that knows anything about industry and
the workforce is that mexicans and other minorities
take up lower end jobs that most whites don't want 
anyways and whites keep glass ceilings to prevent
non-whites from attaining upper level jobs...so all
this bullshit about minorities taking over california 
jobs is bullshit!!
 
all democrats and republicans have read the republican
congressional agenda, the first thing they confess to is
being KKK and Nazi members and it is the job of the
government to protect white supremacy at all costs 
including launching bogus investigations on democrats
because according to the republican congressional agenda
democrats are considered 'un-patriotic' and considered a
threat to republican fascist power and war mongering.
okay, let's review who really killed california...
 
what was the first thing that happened after Bush got in
the white house...there was a spike in the california 
energy prices...and where are most of the energy 
companies headquartered at?...texas!
 
what was the first thing Bush did after 9/11?...freeze
the west coast ports...causing a billion dollar loss of
wages and profits for several industries, union workers,
truckers, store owners, etc.
 
what was the second thing Bush did after 9/11?...the
anti-geek campaign...killing california's number one 
industry - the tech industry, which also pays for 
california's number two industry - the entertainment
industry!
 
what was the third thing Bush did after 9/11?...the
intentional oppression and laying off of non-white
workers specifically arabs and asians to put them
under investigation!
 
what was the reason behind all the state and city
worker lay-off's?...insufficient funds as a result of
the re-allocation of federal funding into homeland 
security rather than state and city funding!!
 
what is the number one killer of the economy aside
from extensive lay-off's?...the destruction of consumer 
confidence through all the war propagandering, which we 
saw almost 24/7 on the news when we first attacked iraq.
now of all these decisions...which did Davis control?...
none of them!...who did?...Bush and the Republicans!

Speaking Wind On Ancient Native American Prophecies 
CommonGround Reflections (Portland Oregon) 
 
Prophecies that speak of the end of the world are nothing new. As the Western world approaches its third millennium, warnings about a worldwide apocalypse are becoming more and more plentiful.
But there are many other traditions that speak of a time when the Earth will undergo an upheaval that will leave it changed forever. The prophecies of the Hopi and other Native American peoples spoke of an end of time long before the European calendar was invented. And according to Native American prophecy expert Speaking Wind, those prophecies have proven to be quite accurate. Speaking Wind, a Pueblo Indian who was raised in the mountains of northern New Mexico, left his career as a international business consultant in 1993 after a mystical experience during which, he believes, he left his body and received a directive from the Great Messenger to speak out on the prophecies.
" I was told it's time to begin working now, the time for doing the silly stuff is over," he said.
Speaking Wind, who will be in Seattle for the Universal Lightworkers Conference July 17-25, recently spoke with Common Ground REFLECTIONS about some of the prophecies he sees coming to fruition in our time.
CGR: What are some of the most important prophecies concerning our generation? Are we entering a period of destruction? 
SW: The prophecies tell us that the Earth Mother is not dying, she is not going to end, she is not going to blow up. She is merely washing her face. 
If you happen to be a particle of dust, or a piece of pollen that has been irritating her eye, or that cannot withstand the washing of her face, then you fall off of her. You're not lost, you're not destroyed, but you're taken to the next Earth, where you get to do this all over again with another layer of emotion. The ones who stay are the ones who no longer need lessons. The prophecies tell us that people will begin to see with their own eyes again.
The prophecy that is that unfolding now is the one that speaks of the Two Twins, the Grandmother and the Grandfather. The Grandfather awakens the Firebird. The Firebird ignites the fire. This prophecy goes back 40,000 years ago, when they were telling us what would happen at the end. Now the Two Twins are two volcanoes. Today, the Twins are going off one by one.
When both the Twins go off simultaneously, and they blow the black smoke into the sky, then the Grandmother awakes from her sleep, feels the cork in her mouth and blows it out, which means that Mexico City goes up into the air. Then she blows so hard she wakes up the Grandfather. Now the Grandfather is Mount Rainier, who is still sending all sort of seismic activity out. As he wakes up, his noise wakes up the Firebird. The Firebird comes out from under the Waters of Life and reignites the Circle of Fire, which is all the volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean. I read last March that the activity in the Ring of Fire has increased to about 3,200 underwater eruptions per month. Once the Ring of Fire ignites, then the Grandmother's land become so turbulent, that the Turtle shakes the tail off, which means Mexico's plates go into the water.
CGR: Are the prophecies warning us of events that cannot be changed? Or is there any way we can alter the prophecies?
SW: They are set into motion already. We have three chances. The first chance that we have to change these ancient prophecies from unfolding was in the sign that was given to our people long time ago. They said that the first warning, you'll have three signs. The First Sign, the prophecies can be changed. The Second Sign, the prophecies can be changed. But when the Third Sign comes, it's too late.
CGR: You believe that we've already seen the first two Signs.
SW: The First Sign was famine that will not be spread worldwide, but will be heard of worldwide. If you look at Africa, we've heard of these things worldwide, yet we did nothing about them.
The Second Sign was when you begin to see life around you change in form.
The Second Sign was shown to us just last year. And it began with the frogs; now it's into the chickens, the cows, the sheep and into a lot of the plants and vegetables that we eat. That was the deformity, the deformity that comes through in three and five legs, six and eight fingers, legs that aren't there, hearts that aren't there, brains that aren't there, two brains, three hearts, two heads. Late November of 1996, there were two medical doctors, one in Prescott in Arizona and one just north of Miami, on CNN, sending out their pleas to ask people to look at what they're doing, look at the babies that are being born. And they showed all these pictures of children with six and eight fingers on hand and maybe no hand on the other arm. Some with an eye in the middle of their head, an ear placed down on their neck. And they said this is the result of all the toxicity that going into the lands.
The Hopi have been saying this for almost five years because our children have been born that way for that long. See, it's spreading. For people to think they are unaffected is to live in the illusion. If you drink water, if you eat food, chances are you have it, because the way the distribution systems are, what's grown in one part of the world is sent to other parts, then it spreads. They told us in the Second Sign that the only to change the prophecy is through spirituality. We have not received the Third Sign yet. My hope is that by speaking of these ancient prophecies, is to explain to people, to remind them, that it's still not too late to stop these events, but you cannot do it any other way except through spirituality.
CGR: This month, thousands of people who describe themselves as Rainbow warriors will be gathering in the wood of Oregon for a Gathering. Where does the Rainbow Tribe fit in the ancient prophecies? What role do they play in our future?
SW: The concept of warrior among the people is no one that fights another person. A warrior battles within himself to find their own truth. The Rainbow People, in these terms, are ones that understand that there is nothing that separates them from their other relations. Ergo, the colors all coming together, the races all coming together. There is nothing that separates them.
But the original term, in the sense of the Rainbow People, they are the ones that would go into the sacred sites all over the face of the Earth.
There is no place on this world that you can stand that there is not a sacred site within 100 miles, that's how many there are. Rainbow People showed us how to call the rainbow. They would stand in these sacred places, they would speak the words, and out from their solar plexus would come a rainbow. The rainbow would be the bridge between Creator and themselves. 
This is how they would see and look on the face of Creator and find their feedback that they needed to do what was needed next by them. These are the Rainbow People. These are the ones who have returned completely now. These are also the ones who are beginning to wake up. As they wake up, they're finding themselves very confused because they feel like they no longer belong where they have been all of their lives. They look at the ones all around them , they look at them as strangers, not realizing that they've changed. But they're beginning to find their own truth. Sometimes in an easy way; other times, in a very difficult way.
The prophecies tell us that the Rainbow Children will be known before the ending of the Second Sign. Before the Third Sign comes, everyone will know and have the opportunity of returning to the rainbow and the Rainbow People, or turning away and walking into the Third Cycle.

Revelation 10
And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, 
clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head,
and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as 
pillars of fire:
2 And he had in his hand a little open: and he set his
right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,
3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth:
and when he had cried, seven thunders had uttered 
their voices.
4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their 
voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice
from heaven saying unto me, seal up those things
which the seven thunders uttered, and write them
not.
5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who
created heaven, and the things therein are, and the
earth therein are, and the sea, and the things which
therein are, that should be time no longer:
7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel,
when we shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
should be finished, as he hath declared to his
servants the prophets.

OPERATION: IRAQI FREEDOM
$20,000 bonus to official 
who agreed on nuke claim
Energy Dept. honcho ordered dissenters at Iraq pre-briefing to 'shut up,
sit down'
 
By Paul Sperry
 
 2003 WorldNetDaily.com    
WASHINGTON  A former Energy Department intelligence chief who agreed
with the White House claim that Iraq had reconstituted its defunct
nuclear-arms program was awarded a total of $20,500 in bonuses during
the build-up to the war, WorldNetDaily has learned. 
Thomas Rider, as acting director of Energy's intelligence office,
overruled senior intelligence officers on his staff in voting for the
position at a National Foreign Intelligence Board meeting at CIA
headquarters last September. 
His officers argued at a pre-briefing at Energy headquarters that there
was no hard evidence to support the alarming Iraq nuclear charge, and
asked to join State Department's dissenting opinion, Energy officials
say. 
Rider ordered them to "shut up and sit down," according to sources
familiar with the meeting. 
As a result, State was the intelligence community's lone dissenter in
the key National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass
destruction, something the Bush administration is quick to remind
critics of its prewar intelligence. 
So far no banned weapons have been found in Iraq to confirm its charges. 
The secret 90-page report, prepared Oct. 1, was rushed to sway members
of Congress ahead of a key vote on granting the White House war-making
authority. It also formed the underlying evidence for the White House's
decision to go to war.

i also remember right before the war, UN world leaders were
openly bribed to side with America for attacking Iraq.
 
i wonder how much they paid people to spread the blasphemies
and lies about me.

Military to Conduct Bio-Terror Exercise 

Friday August 15, 2003 8:49 PM
By ROBERT BURNS 
 
AP Military Writer 
 
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for military operations inside the United States, said Friday it will begin an exercise next week to test its ability to respond to multiple domestic emergencies simultaneously, including a bio-terror attack in Nevada. 
The exercise, dubbed Determined Promise '03, includes a simulated hurricane, real and simulated wildfires, an airborne terrorist threat in Alaska and an outbreak of pneumonic plague in Nevada. 
It begins Monday with the plague outbreak in Clark County, which includes 70 percent of Nevada's population, including Las Vegas. Local authorities will respond first by activating an emergency operations center, followed by action at the state level and activation of the Nevada National Guard on Wednesday. Northern Command will direct the use of active-duty forces. 
At the same time, Northern Command's headquarters at Peterson Air Force Base, Colo., will deal with a variety of simulated natural disasters and terrorist threats elsewhere in the country. 
Lt. Col. Dan Stoneking, a Pentagon spokesman, said the exercise has been planned for months and has no direct connection to this week's power blackouts in the Northeast. 
Fifteen federal offices and agencies will participate, including the assistant secretary of defense for homeland security, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as intelligence agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office and the CIA. 
Also participating will be the American Red Cross and the American Association of Railroads, as well as seven state and local organizations, including National Guard units in Nevada, Alabama and Rhode Island. Twenty-eight active-duty military units will be involved, including the headquarters of Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, Va., and Air Combat Command in Langley, Va. 
As part of the exercise, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, at Colorado Springs, Colo., will conduct a one-day air exercise in Alaska to test the command's ability to deal with potential airborne terrorist threats and to coordinate with Northern Command. 
The exercise will have 2,000 participants and cost $2 million, according to Northern Command. It ends Aug. 28.

Iraqis Offer Tips Over U.S. Blackout 

By NIKO PRICE, Associated Press Writer 

BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraqis who have suffered for months with little electricity gloated Friday over a blackout in the northeastern United States and southern Canada and offered some tips to help Americans beat the heat.

>From frequent showers to rooftop slumber parties, Iraqis have developed advanced techniques to adapt to life without electricity. 

Daily highs have soared above 120 degrees recently as Iraq (news - web sites)'s U.S. administrators have been unable to get power back to prewar levels. Some said it was poetic justice that some Americans should suffer the same fate, if only briefly. 

" Let them taste what we have tasted," said Ali Abdul Hussein, selling "Keep Cold" brand ice chests on a sidewalk. "Let them sit outside drinking tea and smoking cigarettes waiting for the power to come back, just like the Iraqis." 

Here are some tips from the streets of Baghdad: 

_ SLEEP ON THE ROOF. Without power  and hence without air conditioning  Iraqis have taken to climbing up stairs in the hot nights. Some install metal bed frames on rooftops, while others simply stretch out on thin mattresses. "It's cooler there," said Hadia Zeydan Khalaf, 38. 

_ SIT IN THE SHADE. Many Iraqis head outside when the power's off. "We sit in the shade," said George Ruweid, 27, playing cards with friends on the sidewalk. Of the U.S. blackout, he said: "I hope it lasts for 20 years. Let them feel our suffering." 

_ HEAD FOR THE WATER. "We go to the river, just like in the old days," said Saleh Moayet, 53. 

_ SHOWER FREQUENTLY. "I take showers all day," said Raed Ali, 33. 

_ BUY BLOCKS OF ICE. Mohammed Abdul Zahara, 24, sells about 20 a day from a roadside table. 

_ GET A GENERATOR. Abbas Abdul al-Amir, 53, has one of a long row of shops selling generators in Baghdad's Karadah shopping street. When the power goes out, sales go up, he said. 

_ CALL IN THE IRAQIS. Some suggested the Americans ask the Iraqis how to get the power going again. "Let them take experts from Iraq," said Alaa Hussein, 32, waiting in a long line for gas because there was no electricity for the pumps. "Our experts have a lot of experience in these matters."

Very fun!  My Cherokee ripped though that mud - jeeps rock.  Took some
neat video clips but can't find my camera, lol, it was a cheapo Logitech
420, hit me up if I left in your car or if its found.  It might be
buried in that mud somewhere - eek, poor camera.  I'm still covered in
mud from assisting others to get there cars unstuck.

The broadcast was very cool, sounded nasty at one point like bad cables
and levels, but it was still so cool.  Telling people that they could
listen to a stage on the radio and watching there faces.  You could hear
the stage and relay it in your car and the timing was very real time.

Good to see a bunch of faces I haven=92t seen in a while.  Met a quite a
few interesting cool new people too.  Even with not being able to blast
the volume, it was still cool.  I like the radio concept, I would have
like to have seen that setup.  The djs were aswome, heard some really
cool stuff I haven't heard yet - good styles.  Who was that dj playing
that fucked up dnb in the back tent on Saturday late afternoon?

Good to see people all being nice and somewhat tidy, looked like people
were helping clean up.  That heat was nasty intense, that storm actually
felt kind of good.  Tromping around the mud in bare feet and getting mud
all in the toes felt great.  Glad we got a good view of Mars.  Hey if I
just met you, hit me back private style so I can have your email.

I was informed all the stages were shut down at midnight and that the stages were packing up and that all kinds of cars were getting stuck in the mud.  All that information that I was being fed lead to me being absent from the festivities.  I really wanted to be there and was getting ready to leave at 11:30 when I was given all this info.  I have to appologize to Doug if the stage was still going on.  Well hope everyone that went had a good time and that no one was injuried.

well what can i say.  mud fucking everywhere.  i just showered and think 
theres still mud somewhere or other on me.
it rained all afternoon friday, setting it as slightly muddy.  we get 
there at 8ish and have to scramble to setup in a wet field just as its 
starting to rain.   uggggg
we manage to get setup and wander around.  seems 2 stages are running 
and the 3rd is running a little later.  the music goes till 2:30 or so 
and a sheriff pulls in and thats the end of that for the night.
time for sleep, saturday is gonna be a long day i suspect.... and sure 
enough, come 8 am or so, the poo-bahs stage turns on louder than the 
depths of hell.  thanks...
it rains like a fucker, floods out the goahead stage completely.  the 
amps and speakers need saved, and fast.  yuck.  they did manage to have 
it back up and running shortly after the rain died down.  i hope alex's 
dads gear is all in good order?
music went till umm, i dunno 2-3 sat night or so.  maybe longer?  some 
stages seemed to turn off, and come back on.
there was alot of different kinds of music on all the stages, some stuff 
you don't get to hear alot around here much.  GOOD techno, goa, 
ragga.....  pretty much something to listen to somewhere.  plus one 
unnamed stage had a pirate radio rig broadcasting.  nice.   didn't get 
to listen to it, but eh i could hear it in the tent  :)
got to see some people i havent seen in awhile, met a few people too. 
sorry i wasn't really all that chatty. i guess the mud took its toll on me.

hope everyone has recovered and gotten their cars outta the mud.

Subject: {pb-cle} field day II...mud mud mud

and more mud...as though it hasn't been said before. 
Had a decent time, particularly playing through the
storm that happened around 6:30 on sat...it gave us a
captive audience for a whille at least.  Nice to meet
and hang with some of the pgh. bbm folks, not to
mention meghan and chris from goahead and the abbasso
crew that represented (for a while at least).

As for getting out on Sun. morning, thank god for
quattro and a little forethought...the other drive out
of the place was a lot easier to navigate.  I feel for
you if any of y'all got your vehicles stuck, but some
of it was downright amusing to watch (tows out, etc.
etc.).

BTW, if the owner of the Cougar that got stuck between
the poo-bahs and goahead stages late sat night is on
this list fuck you.  you covered my car as well as
several people in mud with your doughnut antics. 
Uncool.

There were a couple more doing it this morning> I think that's just plain
out rude. Also to the kids screaming at the cops while they were leaving
Friday night should have gotten thrown out. It's uncalled for. We're lucky
they even let us stay there for the rest of the weekend. That goes for the
fireworks too at 4am.

There's always going to be rude people man, but I give big ups to the ones
who helped people get cars unstuck even though they didn=B9t know who they
were pushing.=20

I'll post a review after a get a nap in. =3D)

Subject: {pb-cle} field day fun!

    i had a blast at field day. first and foremost,
    major props to the crews that put so much
    into field day! you guys need to take a second,
    wipe the mud from your face and feel proud
    of what you accomplished!

    we got to beck's friday night around 7pm. early
    enough to still set up camp in the light, but late
    enough to miss torential downpour #1. the field
    still looked like a field but had a couple particularly
    muddy spots that i was oh-so-careful to walk
    around! [futile, i know]

    the music was a little slow getting started friday
    night, we basically got settled into our campsite
    and did little roaming. the one set that i was really
    impressed by was dj bumblebee on the ctn stage!

    i decided to call it quits early on friday night when
    the plug was pulled on the music. luke, your drum
    circle would have been a good idea at that point :]

    saturday morning i was drastically pulled from my
    slumber by house music!

    after a tasty breakfast and looting at walmart, i
    was ready for some fun. fun came in the way of
    rain, and lots of it! enter torential downpour #2.
    the trinity stage took on 4" of water, but handled
    it well. the ctn stage didn't miss a beat! verticle
    rain pouring into their tent, i don't know how they
    did it. it was really quite something. it was about
    this point that staying dry seemed pointless, so i
    decided on 100% saturation!

    so, the grassy field +lots of water made for a mushy
    surface. mushy surface + cars = muddly bloody hell!
    as everyone has pointed out - there was _a lot_ of
    mud! everyone took it in stride pretty well. almost
    everyone - there was that chick that did the wipe
    out at the poo-bas stage :-/

    i really enjoyed the music saturday night: techno,
    technoir, dnb, and almost non-stop breakbeats!

    i wish it could have been louder, but after friday
    night, i was happy to have music at any level.

    it was great to see some old faces out, i ran into
    people i haven't seen in years.  overall, it was a
    lot of fun in a field in the middle of nowhere.

    thanks again to all the crews, and to all the cool
    ravers that pitched in and made my weekend
    oh-so-fun!

    btw, i have some pictures too, but i have the
    feeling i am never going to get them online :[

this one says it all:
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/field_day_2/IMG_2577

well what can i say.  mud fucking everywhere.  i just showered and think

theres still mud somewhere or other on me.
it rained all afternoon friday, setting it as slightly muddy.  we get 
there at 8ish and have to scramble to setup in a wet field just as its 
starting to rain.   uggggg
we manage to get setup and wander around.  seems 2 stages are running 
and the 3rd is running a little later.  the music goes till 2:30 or so 
and a sheriff pulls in and thats the end of that for the night.
time for sleep, saturday is gonna be a long day i suspect.... and sure 
enough, come 8 am or so, the poo-bahs stage turns on louder than the 
depths of hell.  thanks...
it rains like a fucker, floods out the goahead stage completely.  the 
amps and speakers need saved, and fast.  yuck.  they did manage to have 
it back up and running shortly after the rain died down.  i hope alex's 
dads gear is all in good order?
music went till umm, i dunno 2-3 sat night or so.  maybe longer?  some 
stages seemed to turn off, and come back on.
there was alot of different kinds of music on all the stages, some stuff

you don't get to hear alot around here much.  GOOD techno, goa, 
ragga.....  pretty much something to listen to somewhere.  plus one 
unnamed stage had a pirate radio rig broadcasting.  nice.   didn't get 
to listen to it, but eh i could hear it in the tent  :)
got to see some people i havent seen in awhile, met a few people too. 
sorry i wasn't really all that chatty. i guess the mud took its toll on
me.

hope everyone has recovered and gotten their cars outta the mud.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} what happened at field day 2?

I'll have a full review later, hopefully, but here is what went on:

Friday went well, considering a late start due to the power outages and the
rain.  The turning down of the stages on Friday was in hopes of avoiding any
real problems on Saturday.  Apparently a few over zeaulous deputy's decided
3:30 am was too late to be playing.  So we complied with their wishes and
shut up shop.  On our stage only 2 djs got screwed out of slots... which
they got to make up Saturday morning when we started back up.


Saturday AM we had a few djs show up late (due to heavy construction in the
Ashland area) and a couple 8am no shows.  Both Mark Mayhem and Kid Chaos
(Corey) decided to play during the day.  We knew we would turn it down at
Midnight, and continue at low levels.  I called Evan, who was busy with
graduation, and excused him from playing.  Chris Eberhart called me, but I
couldn't return the call because you didn't leave a number.  We agreed to
stay open as long as djs showed up (that were scheduled) and wanted to play.
After 2, no one else showed up so we shut down to get ready for the task of
teardown.   Jason Alias and Freebass were the only ones who showed up well
in advance of their timeslots, and I'm oh so glad that they did because they
rocked it, IMHO.  We had a pretty impressive party going on under our tent
friday night and saturday afternoon, so it felt like the right thing to do.

Thanks to everyone who came out and supported....  you are all the best!  I
learned so much.   While I didn't get to spend much time at the other
stages, I really appreciaeted everyone who stopped by The Ascension_Am
Unification Station to say hi.  Thank-you!

the festivities.  I really wanted to be there and was getting ready to leave
at 11:30 when I was given all this info.  I have to appologize to Doug if
the stage was still going on.  Well hope everyone that went had a good time

i had a blast....the only thing that put a damper on my weekend was getting
shocked over at the ctn stage trying to turn it back on after the amps cut
out...the mud wasnt anything new for me...it seems 9 out of 10 times i go
camping i end up in a bog or a swamp

bigup ctn crew for a great time...i hope next summer they can get the same
spot....it was a really nice place before the mud turned it into a mess

Subject: {pb-cle} Field Day 2 review


We got there later than I think we intended on Saturday, it was well after
dark.  I wish I had seen it friday, or even during the day saturday, the
pics look awesome and it seems like it was a lot more happening before the
horrible stormy rain hit.  So it is disappointing to know that that kept
some people away from one of the best lineups in the region to date, at a
price that was very, very hard to beat.

We had fun playing, but I will have to say it was dampened by the fact
that the sound was turned down about 5 times and there was no bass.  But
that's not anyone at field day's fault - rather it was the people in the
trailer parks nearby that just can't let people have some fun.  I know
some of us may have expressed some frustration to this effect, and we
meant no disrespect, I hope it wasn't taken that way. I know I screamed
"theres no fucking bass!!" at least once.  One half of the Luke + Luke
team couldn't make it at the last minute and I know Luke packed up his
gear early, so the promise of the Live PA and records was only filled for
a short while.  But hopefully those of you who heard it enjoyed it.

I want to thank Luke @ Goahead, Dan Sidetrakkt and Matt B for letting us
play at the event and for holding it down under difficult circumstance
(blackout + nasty rain and mud) that kept people away and left DB stranded
in NY.  It disappoints me to hear the few complaints about things that
nobody could help that I've heard this far from people who obviously can't
appreciate the magnitude, time, effort, and money that went into this to
provide YOU with a very cheap party with the best of talent.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to spend much time checking out the other
tents since we got there so late, but from what I heard it sounded good.
Still Life was rocking it at the Poo-bas stage to an unfortunately thin
crowd.  Same with the experimedia stage, a lot of great music and talent
there too, but all but a few people seemed to be sleeping on the sounds
coming from there while I was checking it out.

The mud sucked, but that's life.  To anyone who thinks this party
wasn't what they expected: Given the circumstances - a blackout,
unpredicted rain, trailer parks not previously noted, etc, I feel everyone
involved did an AWESOME job to ensure that the party was kept going..
sometimes things are what you make of them.

I don't remember seeing the cougar, but at one point I saw a pickup 
truck that drove down between the two stages, then did a U turn and 
came back, the whole time spinning it's tires.  Depends if the person 
did it accidentally, only knowing that when they floor it, it started 
to move.  Saw a couple cars get out like that.  But they were doing 
donuts, then yeah, they were just F'ing around.

Definately had a great time... despite the mess. I thought those who threw
this event did a SPECTACULAR job under the circumstances. I also gotta give
everyone props for barely complaining about the lousy weather and for not
letting it spoil a thing. There were a lot of good attitudes and positivity
when it could easily have been the opposite. Yeah, it sucked having to keep
the levels so low and having to end early but at least the cops didn't come
snooping. And where else are you gonna get so much dope music for $5??? Deal
of the century.

 I just finished uploading the pics - this long ass link should take you
straight to them:

If that doesnt work go here:
http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/dblaa2000/lst?&.dir=/&.src=ph&.view=l

click on 'RAVE PHOTOS' then scroll down to the Field Day 2 album. The
mudslide one is awesome. I arranged them differently this time - I tried to
group pics from each stage in the order people played, if I got a stage name
wrong or something forgive me. I'm gonna go check out the pics you guys took
now.

Again mad props and appreciation to everyone who made this happen...

Subject: {pb-cle} field day II review

Just got up a couple hours ago.  Got home, and just had enough time 
to take a shower before going to the family reunion :-/  

I got there around midnight friday night.  This was after the first 
downpour, so was already muddy.  I tried to drive up closer but as 
soon as the tires started to spin I pulled off to the left and didn't 
go anywhere so I went to the right and that's how I got my spot 
that's like 1/4 mile from the stages :)

Music was ok, although at one point, on one of the stages, the sound 
was MAJORLY distorted.  Was really digging the techno and almoast 
left until someone finally did something and it wasn't as bad.  The 
radio idea was really cool.  Although I couldn't get it that well in 
my car that was 1/4 mile away from it (thought it was supposed to go 
out in a 5 mile radius?).  The timeslots got a little confusing 
because the promoters were swapping dj's to get some on early in case 
it got shut down again.  So I mainly checked out the infinity stage 
since I know most of the dj's spinning at that one :)  BTW, it was 
aweful I had to choose between boompsie and trout, who were both 
playing at the same time.  Also stuck around, umm, whatever moose's 
stage was, kept me somewhat dry durring super downpour #2.

And what would a FDII review be without mud?  I came out fairly well, 
took me forever to get anywhere because I tried to avoid all the 
really watery/muddy spots.  Had a few people ask if I lost something 
I was walking so slow and scanning with the flashlight and stuff :)  
It was strange, right after the second downpour, besides puddles it 
was pretty much the same as it was before.  Then as the night went on 
it just gut muddier and muddier.  It got to the point that I gave up 
on trying to find dry areas to walk on, because they didn't exist.  
At least in mud it didn't leak into my shoes after I step in anyting 
deeper then an inch.  Now I'm glad I wear my shoes tight enough that 
they don't slide out :)  The "mud people" antics were hillarious.  I 
got a few pictures, but not sure if they came out or not, still have 
to go through them.  My feet are still all shriveled because I had 
soggy socks on for two days :-/

As usual, nice to meet all the people I did.  I'm terrible with 
names, but it was still nice meeting y'all.  The cops sucked.  I 
guess friday night the stayed there from whenever they got there 
(3:00 ish??) till 7:00.  I think it was kinda good though because 
most people slept for a few hours since there was nothing else to do. 
 It wasn't as bad on Saturday night.  I think because most people 
were expecting it to get shut down, so it was cool that it wasn't.  

Highlights:
- Meeting a bunch of people that I just met at CDG3
- BJ's super glowsticks
- Mud people
- Having sausage gravy and biscuits for breakfast (may clog arteries, 
but damn it's good).  And then auntie anne's pretzel later (super wal 
marts rule)
- Hearing drunk people saying everything is a cock for about a half 
hour
- The shouting matches and ensued durring said cock discussions
- Messing with said drunk people as well as other drunk people
- Messing with this one woman that stayed up the whole time, I think. 
 Although I think she finally passed out sometime saturday night 
because at one point she didn't seem as dazed :)  (btw, I would have 
mentioned your name if I didn't have  crappy memory, you know who you 
are, I think)
- Helping people get their cars unstuck.  Only helped a couple, but 
was still nice to help someone I have no idea who they were.
- Having people think I was security because of the flashing strobe 
on my arm
- People thinking I lost something because I was so slow in walking 
around
- Traaaat, spinning, in what I guess he called "tourist" clothes.  
Just looked too funny for some reason
- some guy saying he hitch-hiked from indiana to get here.

Lowlights:
- Weather (I thought it was going to be clear skies the whole freakin 
weekend?)
- Bugs.  Damn, I don't even remember seeing some of the things that 
were flying around there, and bug spray either not working or 
something.
- Cops.  I think it's starting to be a tradition that the cops have 
to shut us down at some point
- Getting lost on the way back home (was supposed to turn right on 
83, not left, d'oh)

I called it a night early Saturday because I wanted to get a little 
sleep before heading out, so I missed a couple people that I wanted 
to see.  Oh well.  I got out without any problems, and I'm just in a 
convertible, with bad tires.  I dunno what it was, but this year 
didn't seem as good as last year's, it wasn't the mud or anything, 
just seemed liked it missed something.  Maybe because it was a little 
more spread out or something.  BTW, do we have any estimates as to 
how many people there were?  Doesn't seem like there was a lot.  Not 
sure if that's because it was the weather, or people thinking it was 
going to get shutdown or something.

I got a few pictures.  I'll go through and get them online at some 
point or another.  Going to try my had at making a panoramic without 
using some fancy program that does the image stiching for you, bah!  
Just give me photoshop :)

Now I think I'm going back to bed...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Field Day 2 review

This is a note for my review that kinda goes with this.  Even though 
there was a few things I complained about, still had a good time, 
pretty much what I expected, except a little mudier :)  Everyone did 
a great job and holding it together, making it go, even with all the 
things that happened (rain, blackouts, etc)  The positives vastly 
outweighed the few negatives there were.  I hope this doesn't put a 
damper on their spirts and they have it again next year.

...NOW, I'm going back to bed :)

i spin and collect hardcore, and i find it troubling that there is almost zero hardcore djs in northern ohio. i remember dez drastik, but im not sure what hes doing now. hardcore has progressed over the past couple years, and i honestly believe alot of you would like the new stuff coming out. there is so much to choose from now, trancey, expiremental, breabeat, gabber. the production is much better and complex than before, and there are even hardcore releases on ministry of sound, aatw and nukleuz. also, soon to be on perfecto records.
 
i suggest that you forget what you know about hardcore, and check out the new tunes coming out.

Subject: {pb-cle} My Field Days

First things first, mud already mentioned, it was nice that people 
weren't bitching about it.

The actual party and people:
I got there around 10:30 on Friday evening.  I set up my tent in 
about 20-30 minutes (i guess i got there somewhat right after it 
ended raining) and cracked open a beer and went exploring.  I was 
happy to see jason lyman spinning on the poo-bah's stage.  He was 
playing some really soulful stuff that i was feeling.  Right 
around his set is when the fire dancers were doing their little 
jig, entertaining for the average ADD attention span.  I ran into 
shorty and skillz at the ctn stage as some dnb dj was not doing 
anything i was feeling.  I then ran into trout, vr,  and nick s, 
and hung there for a little bit.  Time flew by and trout and I 
shot the shit till about 2:35 when the sheriff rolled up the 
street, I decided to call it a night and while getting ready to 
crash, i could hear the stages getting shut down sequentially, 
then some chick down the way from me was getting into a 'your an 
asshole, you're a bitch' argument with her sig other, 
entertainment that put my ass right to sleep.

Saturday morning i was far enough from the house stage to not have 
been woken by it, instead it was trouty and jenn knockin on the 
tent at around 8:30... it was already getting warm outside. Woke 
up a little bit with the normal pepsi and cigarette breakfast only 
to then be surprised by some masu that jenn cooked up.  that woke 
my ass up and got me going.  I wasnt feeling house music in the 
morning at all, so after that jenn and I went to wally world to 
get the things we needed (beer, ice, buns for brats, extra pair of 
shoes, etc)... got back and spent most of the day with jenn, 
henry, trout, moose, todd, bj, saw a little of ridley, then went 
off and chilled for a little at my tent. around 3ish moose got the 
bbm stage up and i was there for most of the rest of the night 
save walking around a couple times late at night.  It was good to 
see the geriatric raver representation erik, amanda, noise, richi 
hiatus and others already mentioned.  Andy the Pooh dropped a phat 
set or some straight up breakbeats that I was definately feeling.  
I went on after him and i was happy with what i played and some of 
the responses i got (esp from some of the broken beat house i was 
playing, and the kraftwerk breaks track), but not happy with the 
technical aspect of my set and from this point on, my hearing was 
pretty shot for the night.  Whoever it was that went on after me 
was rockin it proper, i guess he's one of clevr's boys? then 
hearing trout spinning some acid techno for his first time out 
spinning in 3 years was something i wasnt going to miss and i 
enjoyed it very much.  of course the BBM dropped it as they always 
do, and i loved it all.  I wandered around a little after the 1-2 
am time (i lost track at this point), and i think i went to sleep 
at around 3:30 or 4.  Woke up, packed up my shit and hit the road.

It was nice meeting doug b., jamie tyler (and his girl, i forgot 
her name already), stephanie, kelly, majestic, amy, and others i'm 
sure i forgot.  It was good seeing some other people jea leigh, 
ra, roxy.. et al. 

Thank you all involved in the promotion aspect, I had a great time 
with good people and good vibes.

-Goose

are you fucking kidding me? hey, maybe if you pulled your head out
of your ass you might know something about hardcore. in the
meantime, quit whining and go try to get people to book you to
spin your "trancey" hardcore on perfecto, you fucking joker.

Um, we may be geriatric ravers, but I'm still the youngest one in the bunch. Poor Richie's got Alzheimer's or somehing because he didn't even remember me ...

track. Created by Jurgen Mutschall (Chaos Records

Leon (aka DeLeon) their debut single entitled
Tomorrow" hit Germany's Top Ten in 1999 and in no
time a staggering amount of record labels scrambled to
get their track on their compilations. Dumonde's
animated synths and refined sound continued to push
the envelope with their remixes for Push, Alice
Deejay, and Barthezz. Their rising DJ popularity was
assisted with follow-up singles including "See the
Light", "Never Look Back", "Memory" and this year,
"Human" & "Atmosphere". 

They have held the most prestigious residency in
Germany at the world-famous 'Dorian Gray", had gigs at
'Glow' in Washington DC, 'Velfarre' in Tokyo and have
headlined massive European dance events such as the
Love Parade, "Nature One", Trance Energy and
Godskitchen Global Gathering.

Mad props to all who helped out with field day.  I was very impressed
that thru all that rain and the sheriffs the party kept on going.  I was
also impressed to see so many people come out, especially considering
the mud Saturday night.  Luke - your setup was awesome.  Right in the
middle of one of the downpours I looked out and saw you sitting in your
director's chair out the rain in front of the stage.  I wish I could
have gotten a picture, but I didn't want to sacrifice my dry clothes.
Moose - that little Mackie system is incredible.  Doug - it was nice to
meet you.  I had a great time at your stage as well.  Jenn & Henry -
thanks for keepin the fort together in the rain and the use of your
grill.  

Also thanks to the mystery person who gave my car a push out of the mud
Sunday morning.

> Anyone have pictures of mr. trout in a tikki shirt?

I have a great one, but you will have to wait to see it due to problems
with our network here.

Subject: {pb-cle} Field day review blah blah, mud sucks anyways

	Dont know Matt B's email, but i did want to apologize... after being 
nice and keeping it down all night, we were just raw pissed by 6 am on 
sunday. That and the Sidetrakt  goa crew went MIA only to turn up in 
time to play for the guy who ended up playing for them (big ups REESE). 
So I asked them if they wouldnt mind it a lil louder (dont EVER ask a 
dj this)...so  I turned it up as much as I could go w/out clippin.
	I bet one of those 8 or so people  that I heard filed complaints 
(within an hour!) had a very interesting wake up call. Maybe next time 
we can play some loud dnb at 6..."Left, right, left. right, Attack, 
jungle massive, attack".
	Once again, sorry I did my own thrashing too. You looked pissed when 
you told us to cut it. I felt like tellin you, o well, they cant shut 
us down if we shut ourselves down anyways.

sorry,
Alex

p.s. this dude and his crew did a fantisique job handling a stage and 
making sure that weekend got carried out through allright the whole 
weekend (and the many hours spent in front talking to cops)... Respect 
is due where it's deserved!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Jamie didn't tell the best (well, worst) part of that Cougar car thing....I was sitting inside said car with the car door wide open...it was pretty ugly in the light of day.  I felt even worse though for the two girls who were walking by and got completely splattered with mud, rocks and grass...that had to hurt. 
 
Anyhow, 'review'.  Over 12 hours barefoot in mud has left me with bruises, a cut, a blister, and bites, sore muscles, and a fever...oh yeah in good shape.  But I'll never complain.  : )  That's what I get I guess for running everywhere, never wearing shoes, and dancing continuously I guess, and not caring how covered I got with mud.
 
So nice to see everyone---Meghan, Chris, Jen, Trout, Moose, Abbasso crew of course, Doug, and many, many more....nice to meet you for the first time Goose (It's Valerie by the way---no prob forgetting the name--after all, wasn't I standing there for 15 minutes trying to remember someones name.  lol.)  Sorry to so many I had only brief conversation with.  Thank you to the BBM guys for having lots of comfy chairs to sit in, and Pennsylvania guys who tried to teach me string lights (yeah, now you guys know where the bruises came from).  
 
Most of the music I caught was either @ the poo-bas, bbm, or goahead stages.  Andy James---1st time hearing, I was liking lots.  Loved Jamie and Thomars set--but of course I'm biased.  Hmm. who else---Moke, Goose, heard good sets.  And the goahead stage early Sunday morning, with the cranked up volume was amusing.  Missed Friday night, since I only got off a plane Sat afternoon----so apologies for not getting there any earlier than we did Sat.

Nice to meet goose too, as well as zone, dave clevr,
mike, and scott (whose dj name i dont't remember) from
the bbm crew - traat, nice to see you again, as well
as roxy and all those others I cannot remember.

Sets I particularly enjoyed:  Andy James, Sinister v
Shapeshifter, Still Life, Scott in the bbm tent at
like 4am (again, don't remember the dj name), and
numerous others whose names i did not know/remember.

Definately had a great time... despite the mess. I thought those who threw
this event did a SPECTACULAR job under the circumstances. I also gotta give
everyone props for barely complaining about the lousy weather and for not
letting it spoil a thing. There were a lot of good attitudes and positivity
when it could easily have been the opposite. Yeah, it sucked having to keep
the levels so low and having to end early but at least the cops didn't come
snooping. And where else are you gonna get so much dope music for $5??? Deal
of the century.

 I just finished uploading the pics - this long ass link should take you
straight to them:

om/&.view=t

If that doesnt work go here:
http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/dblaa2000/lst?&.dir=/&.src=ph&.view=l

click on 'RAVE PHOTOS' then scroll down to the Field Day 2 album. The
mudslide one is awesome. I arranged them differently this time - I tried to
group pics from each stage in the order people played, if I got a stage name
wrong or something forgive me. I'm gonna go check out the pics you guys took
now.

Again mad props and appreciation to everyone who made this happen...

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} field day II review

Props: First and foremost to Matt B. for dreamin it
up and putting it together. All the promoters. 
My sound dude Alex and his dad. If you need dope sound
and lights, they have the hook! All the party peeps
who stayed through the rain and kept great vibes. 

Thanks to Adam Ratana and crew. I hate that we had to 
turn shit down, but you added a great vibe and element
to our stage. Electric Mayhem and Sweet Chaos for 
the early mornin sunrise goa trance service. 


My music reviews are kinda biased, due to the fact that
I didn't leave our stage. I had the chance to hear
Uzi spin for the first time. He came highly recommended
from some people on the NY psytrance list. I had no
idea that dude could whoop it like he did! Boompsie
took it to another level. All of our dj's had some 
new tricks in their sets and it was great to hear them
spin on a dope sound system (Which is one of the reasons
I didn't leave my chair the whole time except to get beer :])
The rain was quite refreshing BJ. 

I love events like Field Day, cuz I know I'm going to 
see some old school headz out. Richi Hiatus and Double AA
are at the top of that list. 

Sorry we didn't hook up the drumcircle. No one was more
disapointed about that then me. 

Mars on Lucky charms damn!

All in all It was a great experience. 

Peace,
Luke

Wow, what an amazing time! I give mad props to the promoters, DJs and everyone involved with the event as well as people who made it through the whole weekend. Considering the circumstances, I thought it went really well and says a lot about the people involved with throwing this that the party stayed afloat all weekend (no pun intended)..
 
I didn't arrive until Saturday around 5:45pm  when it was just begining to get really bad and swampy. I was a little worried at first because when we pulled in, my car almost got stuck and the looks on people's faces were NOT pleasant.. We drove up from Cincinnati so I knew we were staying no matter what, and I am so glad I did.. I really felt like once the rain was done completely (around 9 or so??), the vibe just got a million times better and everyone really seemed to be enjoying themselves. I mainly stayed around the Poobahs and BBM tents - but always heard awesome music everywhere I went.
 
I ran into so many people I hadn't seen in like a year or two, plus it always great to see people from the list... Does anyone have a head count? I think a lot of people left Saturday evening but it did look like it filled back up as the night progressed.
 
All in all a wonderful time and I really hope this event continues..THat camp ground was really tore up by Sunday because of people acting stupid in cars but it would be a great venue for next year! 
 
Oh, and walking around barefoot in the mud was great- except now my feet are really sore...

Just got up a couple hours ago. Got home, and just had enough time 
to take a shower before going to the family reunion :-/ 

I got there around midnight friday night. This was after the first 
downpour, so was already muddy. I tried to drive up closer but as 
soon as the tires started to spin I pulled off to the left and didn't 
go anywhere so I went to the right and that's how I got my spot 
that's like 1/4 mile from the stages :)

Music was ok, although at one point, on one of the stages, the sound 
was MAJORLY distorted. Was really digging the techno and almoast 
left until someone finally did something and it wasn't as bad. The 
radio idea was really cool. Although I couldn't get it that well in 
my car that was 1/4 mile away from it (thought it was supposed to go 
out in a 5 mile radius?). The timeslots got a little confusing 
because the promoters were swapping dj's to get some on early in case 
it got shut down again. So I mainly checked out the infinity stage 
since I know most of the dj's spinning at that one :) BTW, it was 
aweful I had to choose between boompsie and trout, who were both 
playing at the same time. Also stuck around, umm, whatever moose's 
stage was, kept me somewhat dry durring super downpour #2.

And what would a FDII review be without mud? I came out fairly well, 
took me forever to get anywhere because I tried to avoid all the 
really watery/muddy spots. Had a few people ask if I lost something 
I was walking so slow and scanning with the flashlight and stuff :) 
It was strange, right after the second downpour, besides puddles it 
was pretty much the same as it was before. Then as the night went on 
it just gut muddier and muddier. It got to the point that I gave up 
on trying to find dry areas to walk on, because they didn't exist. 
At least in mud it didn't leak into my shoes after I step in anyting 
deeper then an inch. Now I'm glad I wear my shoes tight enough that 
they don't slide out :) The "mud people" antics were hillarious. I 
got a few pictures, but not sure if they came out or not, still have 
to go through them. My feet are still all shriveled because I had 
soggy socks on for two days :-/

As usual, nice to meet all the people I did. I'm terrible with 
names, but it was still nice meeting y'all. The cops sucked. I 
guess friday night the stayed there from whenever they got there 
(3:00 ish??) till 7:00. I think it was kinda good though because 
most people slept for a few hours since there was nothing else to do. 
It wasn't as bad on Saturday night. I think because most people 
were expecting it to get shut down, so it was cool that it wasn't. 

Highlights:
- Meeting a bunch of people that I just met at CDG3
- BJ's super glowsticks
- Mud people
- Having sausage gravy and biscuits for breakfast (may clog arteries, 
but damn it's good). And then auntie anne's pretzel later (super wal 
marts rule)
- Hearing drunk people saying everything is a cock for about a half 
hour
- The shouting matches and ensued durring said cock discussions
- Messing with said drunk people as well as other drunk people
- Messing with this one woman that stayed up the whole time, I think. 
Although I think she finally passed out sometime saturday night 
because at one point she didn't seem as dazed :) (btw, I would have 
mentioned your name if I didn't have crappy memory, you know who you 
are, I think)
- Helping people get their cars unstuck. Only helped a couple, but 
was still nice to help someone I have no idea who they were.
- Having people think I was security because of the flashing strobe 
on my arm
- People thinking I lost something because I was so slow in walking 
around
- Traaaat, spinning, in what I guess he called "tourist" clothes. 
Just looked too funny for some reason
- some guy saying he hitch-hiked from indiana to get here.

Lowlights:
- Weather (I thought it was going to be clear skies the whole freakin 
weekend?)
- Bugs. Damn, I don't even remember seeing some of the things that 
were flying around there, and bug spray either not working or 
something.
- Cops. I think it's starting to be a tradition that the cops have 
to shut us down at some point
- Getting lost on the way back home (was supposed to turn right on 
83, not left, d'oh)

I called it a night early Saturday because I wanted to get a little 
sleep before heading out, so I missed a couple people that I wanted 
to see. Oh well. I got out without any problems, and I'm just in a 
convertible, with bad tires. I dunno what it was, but this year 
didn't seem as good as last year's, it wasn't the mud or anything, 
just seemed liked it missed something. Maybe because it was a little 
more spread out or something. BTW, do we have any estimates as to 
how many people there were? Doesn't seem like there was a lot. Not 
sure if that's because it was the weather, or people thinking it was 
going to get shutdown or something.

I got a few pictures. I'll go through and get them online at some 
point or another. Going to try my had at making a panoramic without 
using some fancy program that does the image stiching for you, bah! 
Just give me photoshop :)

Now I think I'm going back to bed...

> Sets I particularly enjoyed:  Sinister v Shapeshifter,

indeed.  they really rocked it. So did you and Thomar.  There were SO many
good sets being played by people with a lot of heart.  Mad props to the djs
who showed up, braved the weather and sound issues and still managed to play
your hearts out.

Unfortunately I didn't walk around as much as I wanted -- when i went to go
buy waders so I could enjoy the rest of the party my truck got stuck -- 
thanks to Cheshire, and Henry and BJ and everyone else for helping.   If I
had been thinking clearly I would have checked the fuse box earlier and
fixed the 4wd.


One other thing... Matt B... damn man, you and your crew worked your asses
off.  While the weather and sound issues were certainly disenheartening, I
think we are all a bit tougher for it.  THANK YOU MATT B (and the rest of
your crew!)

My mixer was the one that was used on the Trinity Stage, and I don't know who 
is responsible for it, but the bass on the 2nd channel doesn't work at all 
now.  It worked just fine at home before I brought it down to Field Day, but 
now I have to try and get it fixed, and I don't have any idea on how much that 
would cost to get repaired.  Could someone please tell me during who's set it 
was on the Trinity Stage where the bass quit working on the mixer.  I think 
someone was trying to crank the bass and it just totally went out because of 
it.  I'm sorry if I seem bitchy.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Field Day 2 review


I did notice some issues with channel 2.  First, the cartidge went out
when we first stepped up.  Then there was a replacement.  It seemed that
channel 2 was much quieter than channel 3 (and 1 which lukes live pa was
plugged into) on the system, but I could definitely hear bass in the
headphones, it just wasn't being reproduced by the system (aside from the
fact that the subs were turned off).  See if you can hear it in the
headphones for channel 2, but not out of the mixer. if so it means theres
an issue with the out. I just assumed the issues with that channel were a
result of the replacement cartridge. But that doesnt conform to common
sense since the bass was in the headphones.  I don't think it went "out"
during our set, but theres no way to really tell since there was no bass
after about 45 minutes anyway.  I do know that I didnt hear anything
strange in the headphones, they had the "correct" bass for all the
channels.

	I dunno, Meghan, but I do know that some one had turn it up till it 
was clipping, and that was definately hurting the sounds on the highs 
that you had thought was from the amps or something. Everything was in 
check, cept for the mixer so high, and when we cranked it down to 
normal or 0 dB it went away.
	Could also be someone is extra tweaky on their bass knob.

I FINALLY, uploaded my pictures from "On Deck"....sorry it took so long. I have a few pictures a friend took @ Jerry Bonham, and some of mine from Steve Porter @ Abbasso up finally too.  
Eventually I'll get the Field Day pics loaded. 
 
Sorry to those I didn't get good pictures of at On Deck or missed. And sorry for crappy quality photos, no digital camera @ the time.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Field Day 2 review

Thanks Luke I appreciate it! :-)

Okay now on to my review...I would have to say that this was definitely the 
craziet weekend Ive ever had.  First my husband and I went to Wal-Mart to pick 
up a couple lawn chairs, maglights, and some beer.  We got to Field Day around 
9:00pm on Friday and stayed until 5:00am Saturday morning and drove back up to 
Westlake.  

Those cops were being extremely shady.  I was sitting on the back of Mokes 
truck talking with my friend Emily and a cop was standing about 20 feet away 
from us listening to our whole conversation.  He must have stood there for at 
least 15 minutes, then we saw him walking around shining his flashlight on the 
ground.  

While I was back up home I was able to take a shower, sleep, eat and throw mine 
and my husbands shoes into the wash.  

We got back to Field Day around 2:30pm and it hadnt rained yet that day, but I 
think about 20 minutes to  hour later it just poured.  I finally decided to 
take my socks off and just wear my shoes without them.  

While I was spinning, my record bag fell off of the thing it was sitting on, 
and at least half of my records got mud on them not too terribly bad, but I did 
get them cleaned off yesterday, and I threw my record bag in the wash and it 
came out as good as new.  

One of our new lawn chairs got swiped, and I also lost the one maglight we just 
bought.  Some other crazy shit happened as well, but all in all I still had a 
very good time.  We ended up leaving for good around 6:00am on Sunday.  Thanks 
to Matt B. and all the other people involved with Field Day and also the people 
who helped us get our car out of that muddy mess!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Field Day 2 review

A suggestion: How about next time somebody decides to throw a outdoor event
why not use a amplitheater (bearcreek)?  They are intended for outdoor
musical events that are loud.  If you use a camp  ground guess what?  The
people living around you will call the police and they will shut you down.
Not because "pigs suck" but because those people have a right to not hear
loud music at 3am while they try and sleep.  I just think its highly
irresponsible to keep throwing shows in the same style of venue that will
always get complaints called on it.

This is the second time I didnt get to play because of shit getting shut
down.  I'm not gonna give a big boo hoo party for me cuz I know nobody cares
but I'm not taking time out of my schedule to play anymore.

I'm not sure how much it costs to rent out an amphitheater for the

all the landlords I've ever delt with will suck as much money out of you as
possible.  I don't think this would be any different for campground owners.
Its only a suggestion though.  Do what you like.  I know I will.

Subject: {pb-cle} Big Blackout

I believe it was here that someone mentioned they'd like to see a comparison 
of light density images before and after the big blackout. Well here is an 
image from an NOAA satellite.

I myself found humor in the bedrock reference to 'hardcore'...

if youre referring to Perfecto, Oakenfold has allowed, and will probably be releasing this on Perfecto Records, DJ Hixxy to remix the tune "bullet in the gun". DJ Irene used it on her new mix, but played it on the wrong speed. :(

who's to say what the "right" speed is, if records were to be played at 
the "right" speed they would clearly be labelled with "33", "45", or 
"78" and there would be no pitch slider on the 1200s.

It's kind of funny, I think the right speed is the speed the record is cut
at, and when the pitch slider is at 0.  That's what I use when I'm
listening to stuff.  Obviously when you play a set you have to adjust the
speeds of records so the beats are matched, but nothing aggravates me more
when someone starts their set with the first record at +8 (and soon to be
+12, +16 etc with these newfangled tables).

in a very few cases i can think of records that sound good enough 
to be played at their wrong speed. otherwise, i like to not really 
go outside of +/- 4% or so. really, whats the point of the artist 
making the record in the first place if the deejay thinks he can 
do something better with it? i wouldnt buy a record that i thought 
i could improve...

I would think a remix would be more of a re-interpretation rather than an
improvement.   Unless you are talking about those producers who make a
horrible track, then pay some big name people top dollar to remix it, and
then everyone plays the remix and ignores the original.

Current "Jungle/DNB" styles of Hardcore sound AMAZINGLY better when played 
at -6 or so.


Dylan, Loxy, Ink, all those guys, pitch em down to -6 and you got a 
seriously DOPE tune.


Better than this ridiculous 180bpm bullshit.

lets start with the mud.........if anyone was wondering, my car was the grey chevy lumina parked sideways buried in the mud behind the porto-shitters. i'd like to thank the dude with the green dodge durango for pulling me out sunday morning. thanks also to the others who helped push my car. nox didn't help push because he didn't want to get muddy, but because he's such a stellar dude i didn't care(lol). btw, he tore shit up! 
 
i hung out mostly at the goahead stage and my crew definitely showed it's skills proper. luke was definitely the godfather sitting in his chair overlooking his peeps. of course hearing techno most of the night made it for me. thanks to all who enjoyed my set! i think i was enjoying it as much as anyone even though i was standing behind the decks in my bare feet. i think aaron got a good shot of that. alex forte made everything sound and look good, you rock man!!!
 
lindsey and i tried to hang out with and meet as many people as possible(we didn't get there until 4ish saturday), however the mud beat us down and we eventually crashed into our lovely tent around 5 sunday morning. it was great seeing some old friends and meeting new ones. henn and jenry(great cookies btw), ray, ken, richie, moose, doug, clevr, zone, trout, todd, jwan, adam, aaron, uzi, jayson, ridley, etc.........
 
thank god for paved roads.........
 
peace,

Jamie didn't tell the best (well, worst) part of that Cougar car thing....I was sitting inside said car with the car door wide open...it was pretty ugly in the light of day. I felt even worse though for the two girls who were walking by and got completely splattered with mud, rocks and grass...that had to hurt. 

Anyhow, 'review'. Over 12 hours barefoot in mud has left me with bruises, a cut, a blister, and bites, sore muscles, and a fever...oh yeah in good shape. But I'll never complain. : ) That's what I get I guess for running everywhere, never wearing shoes, and dancing continuously I guess, and not caring how covered I got with mud.

So nice to see everyone---Meghan, Chris, Jen, Trout, Moose, Abbasso crew of course, Doug, and many, many more....nice to meet you for the first time Goose (It's Valerie by the way---no prob forgetting the name--after all, wasn't I standing there for 15 minutes trying to remember someones name. lol.) Sorry to so many I had only brief conversation with. Thank you to the BBM guys for having lots of comfy chairs to sit in, and Pennsylvania guys who tried to teach me string lights (yeah, now you guys know where the bruises came from). 

Most of the music I caught was either @ the poo-bas, bbm, or goahead stages. Andy James---1st time hearing, I was liking lots. Loved Jamie and Thomars set--but of course I'm biased. Hmm. who else---Moke, Goose, heard good sets. And the goahead stage early Sunday morning, with the cranked up volume was amusing. Missed Friday night, since I only got off a plane Sat afternoon----so apologies for not getting there any earlier than we did Sat.

Even many amphitheatres have curfews.  Blossom in Cuyahoga falls has one at
11pm or midnight at the latest.

A suggestion: How about next time somebody decides to throw a outdoor event
why not use a amplitheater (bearcreek)?  They are intended for outdoor
musical events that are loud.  If you use a camp  ground guess what?  The
people living around you will call the police and they will shut you down.
Not because "pigs suck" but because those people have a right to not hear
loud music at 3am while they try and sleep.  I just think its highly
irresponsible to keep throwing shows in the same style of venue that will
always get complaints called on it.

This is the second time I didnt get to play because of shit getting shut
down.  I'm not gonna give a big boo hoo party for me cuz I know nobody cares
but I'm not taking time out of my schedule to play anymore.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} lack of hardcore in northern ohio.


I think there's a lot of records that sound good at a lot of pitch settings. 
  It's true that a change in tempo can change the mood of a track, but the 
original artist's musicality remains, for the most part, in tact.  The thing 
that really peeves me is when DJ's think they can improve a track by 
constantly fiddling with EQ's and kills.  But, hey, whatever makes the crowd 
happy, I suppose.......

Back to the subject, my impression is that a lot of electronic music artists 
make music knowing perfectly well that it's going to get played at different 
tempos by different DJ's... but I could be wrong...

i dont know, ive put some thought into that. the thing is, i would
have a go at a horrible record to try and make it good. but i
would expect to be paid for doing so, not paying to do so. if a
track was already good, i dont think id ever consider touching it.

im normally not a fan either, but theo parrish absolutely crushes
things with his EQ when he plays and it really makes his sets better.

well obviously there's only a +/- 10 BPM window to play with on an
unmodified 1200, but im guessing that house producers dont pay
great singers to get them into their studio to eventually end up
sounding like a chipmunk or like theyre drunk. but maybe they do.

i usually feel really strongly about rmxes, either i love them
much more than the original, or i think theyre trash. not much
inbetween room there. alot of it does have to do with getting a
remixer with lots of style who is going to be able to do something
interesting with the original.

that shit's just a joke.

Sorry so late in jumping on the reviews...

Had a blast...wish we could have stayed for the full three days but =
family situations called...

Cool personal moment for us was when David (Deviant) started his set on =
Saturday with Tenaglia's remix of The Orb's "Little Fluffy Clouds" at =
the tail end of a thunderstorm, and after the track, the sunset emerged =
with some clear skies and orange, cotton-candy clouds. "Aah." Doug and I =
had a nice grin exchange on that one.

Got to meet some great people...WORD especially to W. for chasing me =
down out of the shadows to say what's up, offer a beer and be a familiar =
face. Finally got to hear Trout play, then got a fantastic workout =
sprinting (well, trying to sprint) through the mud to hear Boompsie...

If I have one complaint and I'm sorry if I'm sounding bitchy and jaded, =
it's that Saturday night around 1am when we had to leave, I saw more =
kids hanging out in their cars than I saw people near the tents vibin' =
the music or dancing...Many dj's played to no one during the day on =
Saturday...It's cool that people need/want a place just to chill, but I =
guess I know how much heart both djs and promoters put into events and =
tent presence provides positive feedback...I kind of felt like some =
folks were just looking for a place to park for cheap, but who =
knows...maybe it wasn't lack of interest in the music, just lack of =
ability to get around because of the mud.=20

Props to everyone who made it happen...thanks esp to Doug for connecting =
us. We'll have our FD2 pix up sometime next week after Cusick.

i'd view any remix i did as better than the original, because i'm just 
better like that.

i don't think thats a curfew.  alot of concerts are over at 11, to get 
everyone out by midnight for insurance reasons.
i'm talking indoor concerts and the like too.

concerts don't go after midnight until you get into the bar area of 
things or smaller productions that are not on the radar.

Hardcore is usually from 140 to 160 BPM.

Sorry so late in jumping on the reviews...

Had a blast...wish we could have stayed for the full three days but family
situations called...

Cool personal moment for us was when David (Deviant) started his set on
Saturday with Tenaglia's remix of The Orb's "Little Fluffy Clouds" at the
tail end of a thunderstorm, and after the track, the sunset emerged with
some clear skies and orange, cotton-candy clouds. "Aah." Doug and I had a
nice grin exchange on that one.

Got to meet some great people...WORD especially to W. for chasing me down
out of the shadows to say what's up, offer a beer and be a familiar face.
Finally got to hear Trout play, then got a fantastic workout sprinting
(well, trying to sprint) through the mud to hear Boompsie...

If I have one complaint and I'm sorry if I'm sounding bitchy and jaded, it's
that Saturday night around 1am when we had to leave, I saw more kids hanging
out in their cars than I saw people near the tents vibin' the music or
dancing...Many dj's played to no one during the day on Saturday...It's cool
that people need/want a place just to chill, but I guess I know how much
heart both djs and promoters put into events and tent presence provides
positive feedback...I kind of felt like some folks were just looking for a
place to park for cheap, but who knows...maybe it wasn't lack of interest in
the music, just lack of ability to get around because of the mud.

Props to everyone who made it happen...thanks esp to Doug for connecting us.
We'll have our FD2 pix up sometime next week after Cusick.

Subject: {pb-cle} Field day 2



Here's a little over sight.

Got there Friday night around 11pm. Didn't expect the mud at all, but was a
very interesting view of what the weekend would be like. Set up the tents,
started drinking and what not. Got to walk around for a little bit to say
hey to everyone, but swear I couldn't find one face I knew besides Goose. H=
e
happen to set his tent up 2 or 3 down from ours which was cool also.

Went to sleep a little afterwards because I had to get up real early in the
morning to visit family, (which I thought was a very responsible move). I
got woken up by the cops screaming at people to turn off the car stereo's. =
I
didn=B9t know what the heck was going on at the time so I decided to get up
and make sure everyone in our little area was behaving.  ;)

Since I stayed up I couldn=B9t sleep for hours it seemed. Everyone else was
drinking being a bit loud, yet funny so I just stayed awake to laugh at the
silly ones that were around us.

Finally everyone started getting tired which was around 8am 9ish, yet I had
to leave to meet family at 10am. I started drinking around 6am so by the
time I got to see my parents, I was pretty hammered. They don=B9t mind
sometimes. It isn't like I act a fool, but its the principle. Anyways, got
to see everyone, came back to mothers house and slept till 830pm. Woke up,
drive back to the event to find my cooler still there, but the tent gone. I
had no idea that there was a storm at all during the day. Someone later tol=
d
me that the tent had blowen away. I felt so bad......

Stuck around, got to play on the control the night stage for two hours sinc=
e
no one really showed up. I didn=B9t mind, I got dj ra to play with me also.
Then I was told the cops wanted the tent to shut down at 12am. Cool...

Got to walk around some more, saw curt, doug, ratana, dave, trouty, bbm
guys, todd, amanda. If I forgot anyone please forgive me. Got to drinking a
bit more than the night before and watched 20 some people pushing 3 cars ou=
t
of a mud mess. Dave and I went over to take pictures, and dave started to
help the guys get these cars out of the mess. Finally in no time the cars
are loose. We stick around some more to see people mud diving near the bbm
stage. It was great. I tried taking pictures but my cam wasn=B9t getting a
clear shot in the night time. I was really salty at that.

I got to see some friends I grew up with back in the day, in elyria which
was really freakin awesome. I love those guys....

Pretty much I slept in my car till the next morning. Picked up some things
around our area and such, then left to come home back to pittsburgh. Oh yea=
,
we also found our tent later in the night, hanging on the side of the woods=
.
Not to mention we found leaches inside the tent too. Ugh.

I had a really good time. I think the mud and everything mad the event MORE
interesting. I know some people bitched about being muddy and all, but I
thought it was the greatest thing in the world.

I totally want to thank the guys that tried getting help, pushing us out of
the mud. John positioned his car right and got unstuck. I came back to
thanks you but you were missed. =3D(  I also want to thank those that helped

it seemed you were spinning slower than 140.  i like shit well over 
150.  if not 170-180.

gets too slow its just boring hardhouse sounding stuff, but some people 
seem to like that.

i think ppl started chilling by cars/tents/fires cuz they were just sick of
clopping through the mud...i know i stayed at my fire for a bit trying to
get my feet dry...i fucking hate wet feet....its the worst feeling in the
world to me....of course after i polished off the case of beer i didnt care
anymore and went back to trying to cause mayhem and bedlam :)

at any rate field day was an awesome time...the most fun ive had out in
awhile.

Mashed breakbeats at 157BPM don't sound like hard house, Trout.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} lack of hardcore in northern ohio.

yes, when you played at class cuts.

maybe you were too messed up or something, but it was terribly slow, 
boring, and sprinkled with trainwrecks and spotty mixes. i ended up 
outside.  i suspected it was HHC records at 33 or something.

i've seen a few supposed hardcore djs spinning this stuff that i don't 
care to do my homework and find out what it is, but its closer to 
hardhouse than hardcore.  i'm not going to get into semantics over 
hardcore vs. hardhouse vs. gabber with you.  i call it borecore, i'm 
sure its not in the official book of hardcore.

I actually get sick if I my pants are soak and wet. That's the worst feeling
in the world to me. That's also why I get reaaaaally mad when someone plays
a joke and pushs me into a pool in full gear.

Rawr!

unless you had a pitched cd player there'd be the sketchy mixes?

i didn't stick around all too long to hear the anthems and whatnot, 
after a bit i ended up outside.  maybe it got better i don't know.   i 
do remember them sounding too slow, like 45s at 33 sort of thing and i 
remember bad mixes.

i know you can mix, i've heard some of the mixes online.  i'm talking 
about the one time i saw you live.

Nah, I just don't cut dubplates, they cost too much and sound like ass; I'd 
rather play CDs like a normal 21st century person.

I have done that in the past RARELY, but I didn't play a single 45rpm hhc 
tune on 33 at Class Cuts; I played very standard as the crowd knew NOTHING 
about Hardcore at the time (with the exception of a few people)

Hey, it happens.  I don't remember any, but I'm sure they happened if you 
say so.

It's all good; I wasn't oh-so-happy with my set at that party, but that 
party kinda sucked anyway, so whatever.

I would consider that just a re-interpretation. Better or Worse means 
nothing when it comes to emotion / opinion (in my opinion).


What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Field Day 2 review

Its ok because I am not going to take time out of my schedule for your 
constant whining and your rock star attitude.  Out of everyone that played 
you are the only person that constantly complained of their time slot. The 
times had to be changed on several stages just to suit Mr. Jeff Storms 
preference.  It is almost impossible to find an outdoor venue anywhere in NE 
Ohio where you are able to play music 24 hours without the threat of people 
complaining.  Even places such as Blossom have restrictions on what time 
music can be played.  I am sorry but I challange anyone who complained about 
this event to try to do better.  I will follow this email with my review 
shortly..

why use vinyl at all?  DATs are best, short of a laptop with a pro sound
card.... 96khz, 24 bit, no compression.  blows a cd away on specs.  cds
are such 1980s technology.   =)

hmmm.  you were the only hardcore type dj.   you probably werent around
at 6am for the wonderful response to my set.  like 15 kids milling
around and the owner of the club screaming about his bedtime.  i just
kept turning it up, figured if it was loud enough i couldn't hear him.

flyer back with lineup at:
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/flyers/2000_08_18_class_cuts_inside?full=1
look over the lineup.  the problem was it was a one room event with
house, trance, hardcore, disco house, jungle, breaks, and ummm,
"troutcore" (check the flyer!).  i think split up into 2 rooms with the
house and trance in one room, the rest in the other.  one room events
are rough sometimes lineupwise.
i think the flyer itself was brilliant, the decorations went with the
theme, as did the "hall pass" dj laminate.

A short review...

All the heads on this list will be happy to know that the 
psy-goa-progressive scene was very well represented at this 
multi-stage/style event in Wooster, Ohio.  Thanks to all the psy, goa & 
progressive dj's/crews who came from all over to the Goahead tent: 
Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus (I hope I didn't miss anyone's origins).  
Because of them, any unsuspecting raver with a binky on a string at that 
event could hear these sounds that we all love and enjoy, and even take for 
granted here in the city.  Be it daytime, peak-time or morning.  Every time 
a psy, goa or progressive DJ would get behind the decks, a crowd would 
gather around and get really excited.  Who knows, maybe the house nation is 
starting to get a crack in it's foundation, because one could easily tell 
the kids are just dying for a new sound (all other stages played house, 
d'n'b, house, cheesy trance, house and more house, oh experimental stage was 
great tho too).  Two obstacles hindered the event from being all it was 
meant to be: rain and the subsequent flooding and mud; and of course, the 
man.  After 2 am, the bass was supposed to be off entirely until 8 am.  Good 
thing toward the morning most of the stages said fuck it, and kicked it back 
up.  This event has the potential of becoming a staple in the 
north-east/mid-west scene.  It reminded me a lot of what Toronto crews do 
with WEMF, my hope is that Field Day will continue to grow and attract 
bigger crowds.  That rests in part on the shoulders of the promoters who 
this year went in with the complete understanding that they will be picking 
up the tab.  And they did.  That is a community service worth praise.  Props 
to Goahead Productions for representing all the way.  They are planning 
quite a bit for the future of goa, psy & progressive in those parts.  If 
anyone has any ideas on how to participate, be it with DJ's, art, tour 
bookings, var. connects, taking trips to events or whatever, let's hear it.  
I think there is a certain responsibility that we have before the rest of 
the region, being in NYC and having a thriving scene as we do.  I don't 
wanna come off too utopian, but we are a movement only when we get together 
and make things happen, collaboratively and sometimes over distances (in 
this case only 7.5 hrs drive).  To sum up though, the event was a kick ass 
time and an indication of good things to come for trance in that neck of the 
woods.

I totally respect that this was intended for a small, targeted audience. But why, in the course of
saying all these good things, does the author feel the need to rip the "house nation"? I know you,
Luke, have a pretty open mind about stuff, and it appears as though you "live in harmony" with your
house-based bretheren...

I've rarely heard goa/psy slagged in the general population, and I know it's not lumped in with the
"pussy trance" stuff. So why all the hostility, esp. towards house, which pretty much birthed all
these other sub-genres???

A short review...

All the heads on this list will be happy to know that the
psy-goa-progressive scene was very well represented at this
multi-stage/style event in Wooster, Ohio.  Thanks to all the psy, goa &
progressive dj's/crews who came from all over to the Goahead tent:
Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus (I hope I didn't miss anyone's origins).
Because of them, any unsuspecting raver with a binky on a string at that
event could hear these sounds that we all love and enjoy, and even take for
granted here in the city.  Be it daytime, peak-time or morning.  Every time
a psy, goa or progressive DJ would get behind the decks, a crowd would
gather around and get really excited.  Who knows, maybe the house nation is
starting to get a crack in it's foundation, because one could easily tell
the kids are just dying for a new sound (all other stages played house,
d'n'b, house, cheesy trance, house and more house, oh experimental stage was
great tho too).  Two obstacles hindered the event from being all it was
meant to be: rain and the subsequent flooding and mud; and of course, the
man.  After 2 am, the bass was supposed to be off entirely until 8 am.  Good
thing toward the morning most of the stages said fuck it, and kicked it back
up.  This event has the potential of becoming a staple in the
north-east/mid-west scene.  It reminded me a lot of what Toronto crews do
with WEMF, my hope is that Field Day will continue to grow and attract
bigger crowds.  That rests in part on the shoulders of the promoters who
this year went in with the complete understanding that they will be picking
up the tab.  And they did.  That is a community service worth praise.  Props
to Goahead Productions for representing all the way.  They are planning
quite a bit for the future of goa, psy & progressive in those parts.  If
anyone has any ideas on how to participate, be it with DJ's, art, tour
bookings, var. connects, taking trips to events or whatever, let's hear it.
I think there is a certain responsibility that we have before the rest of
the region, being in NYC and having a thriving scene as we do.  I don't
wanna come off too utopian, but we are a movement only when we get together
and make things happen, collaboratively and sometimes over distances (in
this case only 7.5 hrs drive).  To sum up though, the event was a kick ass
time and an indication of good things to come for trance in that neck of the
woods.

first off id like to say this album has met and
exceeded any expectations i have had thus far. its
simply brilliant. 

the first few tracks are quite minimal but once
disconnect starts [track 4] get ready to boogie. you
can definitely see the progression from sheet one [10
years ago!] but even moreso w/ consumed. [fyi: it DOES
NOT sound like consumed] its glitchy minimal goodness.


droning beats and aciiiid what more could you want?

im gonna polish up my dancing shoes in the hopes there
is some sort of plastikman release party! yes yes yes!

debates of marketing, selloutability and ego can
start..now!

Yeah, I still felt like I should post the review
unedited though. It is one person's perspective,
not necessarily my feelings. I do love all forms
of music. I think one of the great things about
fielday was all of the representation of genres.
Our stage had disco house and old school jungle
also. Again, this was just one person's perspective. 


Peace,
Luke

I don't think he really bashed house music too badly. Obviously he doesn't
have respect for it as a serious genre but when you are into what he is then
it is somewhat understandable... haven't ever been big on house (obviously
there is a lot of diversity within the genre and it's easy to generalize)
myself but I do respect it as sorta the 'godfather' of edm.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} An fd2 review from NYC 

indeed.  Keep the drama for the more simplistic raver 101 set of
formulamatic music please...   how would you like us to refer to anthem
trance or anything with a formulamatic arpeggiation or a pre-programmed
hoover as goa... talk about unoriginal rubbish.  At least a small amount of
house uses live instrumentation and bands and the good stuff isn't written
in acid or rebirth or any other formulamatic program of the month.

Each stage represented pretty much one paticular sound,  and i feel we
filled in blanks very well... we had techno and some glitchier stuff as well
as breaks, trance and dnb and a live pa.  We tryed to design our stage so
that no one had to walk around the party and hear the same thing.
Revolution 3 i was subjected to 3 stages ALL playing either anthem trance or
dnb for 4 hours and I was trying to not have that happen at field day.

Admittedly about 40% of our lineup was house, but most of them were on the
techier and underground side of it.  I also noticed that it was not only the
goahead stage packed on saturday but also the breakbeat militia... in fact I
would say BBM had the most consistent crowd of anyone.  I also assume that
people stayed in the BBM area and Goahead area on Saturday in part because
they were the "new" stage and not that many fresh people came to the party
on saturday so there was no desire for them to check out the old muddy
stages.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} An fd2 review from NYC 

That wasn't meant as a slam on goa....

I'm simply trying to say that there are styles of music refered to as
"house" that are not house.  Hard House and Progressive House are not really
house in the traditional sense.

Anything made in acid is just a tool, really.  Be it house or any other
style.

It's all good. I never take offense to opinions.
We all have our own preference. I know many
more people that can't get with Goa/Psy than
most other genres including Happy Hardcore. 

That review had some great things to say if
you can get past his musical preferences. 

Peace,
Luke

<<Anything made in acid is just a tool, really.  Be it house or any other style.>>

Hey man, some of us are trying!

I've said it before and I'll say it again: I don't care if you're using two spoons and a coffee
can...the tools aern't important...the music is.

I do understand what you're getting at, though...too many people with too little real skills trying
to pass their "stolen" loops and craptastic skills off as good house, good techno, good whatever.

Hard work, emotion, creativity, originality....these are the things that make great music. Any idiot
can cut and paste a bunch of loops.

Sure I'd like to have $100 G's of quality outboard gear, analog synths out the ass, and a studio
setup to record it all, but my situation doesn't lend itself to that. However, that doesn't stop me
from learning what it takes to make truly quality music and working on it every night for months at
a time with the tools that I CAN get my hands on...

While I'm talking the talk, I suppose I should walk the walk:
http://www.hypnotyza.com/files/newtracks/05-03-03.mp3

This is an original, unfinished track that I worked on for a month or so. Made with Reason, Acid,
and a couple no-name apps. Give it a try and tell me what you think.

Mark

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} An fd2 review from NYC

i have to dissagree with you on the acid thing doug...the sequencer/tracker
is only one part of production....acid, cubase, cakewalk and logic all
pretty much do the same thing....in the end it all comes down to what you
are doing with your samples or hardware

thats just my 2 cents though

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} An fd2 review from NYC

I'm not a musician, and don't claim to know it all.

There are styles of music that get passed off as being "complicated" when
they are just formulamatic.  The use of arpeggiation, for example.  All
those steps sound really complicated to someone, but to write a track using
it is really easy.

As for acid, etc.  As long as you find something new to do, it is still
cool.  However, I think the use of these things instead of actual studio
production has lended its hand to making disposible dance music.  Tracks
should have longevity and we need that right now to make our scene grow, but
the sample based way of making/writing music is really disposable.   The
longevity is a barely a year in many cases.  HOWEVER... it is a great
starting point... so I'm not trying to dog it.  I just think that we need
more original musicians to help them out!

yes, arpeggios got played out in the whole pussy trance thing.  and 
basically the same octave jump ones.

some of the best acid lines were made by pulling the batteries out of a 
303 for a bit and putting them back in and playing the scrambled up 
patterns.

software has changed the way i write music, i use less and less hardware 
anymore.  the soft synths can just do stuff that hardware hasn't caught 
up to.

The concept of RAVE needs to be reinvinted.  Disco simply became house, so
there needs to be a universal reconcept of RAVE.  It will probably come
soon.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} An fd2 review from NYC

i have an observation on the non-bitch about styles/production/whatever you
want to pick out of the first post.  I'd like to say that was the first
review I've ever read.  Forreal, it was intuitive, informative, and it had a
message to his people saying 'dayum, it was good to see the interest there,
maybe we should volunteer some of our efforts into bringing our sound to the
midwest more often if that is what is desired...who's with me?'  it wasn't
'house music sucks' as much as it was 'people are interested in our shit.'
but that's the pb-cle for ya... i think we discussed this at field day...
how the list is all production and people saying this genre is dumb, or this
dj plays his records too slow, or this track is off the hiezay.  When are
the posts going to come back to this list where it is "who wants to throw
some events together" or "who wants to have a list party" or "who thinks
that the scene is dead and we should now start our rebirth (not the
production tool, guys)"  who's willing to bust their ass and come up with
some originality instead of cookie cutting from the past?  field day is one
of the only events of the year that really draws a crowd or is talked about
by listees.... everything else is talking about club nights or why happy
hardcore sucks (cause it just does :oP).. so as the original author
challenged his peers on his mailing list, I now challenge you... who's gonna
step up and say 'i'm gonna do something that evolves our local scene'... is
it you?

its a sell out. glitch is popular amongst white "techno" fans 
these days, so thats what he churned out. consumed will be his 
masterwork then. it was atmospheric acid, with almost no beats. 
this new record has beats in the popular style along with vocals, 
which are totally missing the "faceless" aspect of plastikman. 
he's really just trying to appeal to white "intellectual" music 
lovers, and im sure it will do just that : P 

that said theres one really dope track near the end (forget the 
title) which i could possibly buy on a single, but i wont be 
buying the album. 

>droning beats and aciiiid what more could you want?

no beats and no vocals. 

>im gonna polish up my dancing shoes in the hopes there

its all true.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} An fd2 review from NYC

Mutha Goose....

I take responsibility for this latest round of "WTF?"...but it was done with the best of
intentions....

My original statement was that it WAS a good review (for the very reasons you stated) but it was
marred by the same class-ism or genre-ism that ripped things apart in the first place. I suppose my
complaint was that he ruined a perfectly good review by bringing that stuff up.

As to your other point:

I give/gave you mad props for CDG.
I give CTN and the other involved parties mad props for Field Day.

Hell, I give props to ANYONE doing ANYTHING at this stage in the game to encourage the sense of
community and provide a time/place to do our thing. Now is not an easy time to be associated with
this type of music or culture. But people are still donig it.

For the love of it, I suppose, cause it sure ain't for the money or the prestige. Throwing a party
these days pretty much guarantees only two things: complaints and debt. So I give respect and any
help I can to those who still have the patience and the sack to do it.

Let's push things forward.

It's not dead, just evolving into something else. It's definately going 
back to the underground, as it's coming out of national (POPular) and 
"whats cool" type of focus. As long as new people are still coming into 
the scene or getting involved in EDM, you can't possibly say it's dying.

Nice topic, ive definately given it some thought. If you are right, 
this list wont be up forever, so i'll have to call you up and say back 
in '03 you had a good point.

Subject: {pb-cle} fd2 - reward offered-

I will offer a reward to anyone who can provide any information on the 
owners of the three import vehicles who cut across the field Sunday morning 
into the campgrounds.  The vehicles were parked to the very back left of the 
venue and consisted of what I believe to be a Volkswagen gti, Mitsu eclipse 
and a car of another make.  The vehicles cut across the field and proceeded 
to do donuts and speed through out the campground where children were at 
play.  If anyone has information on the owners of the vehicles it will be 
appreciated.  You identity will of course remain confidential.  Many stupid 
ignorant acts took place this weekend which I let slide but the endangering 
of children is something that will not go without some type of retribution.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RAVE: R.I.P. 1990-2000

OMG I think this discussion has been happening SINCE 1990... how many times
have we eulogized this regional scene and the entire rave scene in this
country. I remember people saying similar things when I lived in So. Cal in
the mid 90's. IMO there really hasn't been a true 'scene' around here since
early 2000 so when we were talking about this nearly 4 years ago it was more
relevant. This past weekend was simply a throwback... it was something that
really hasn't happened much in recent times... an actual true, pure
underground style party with that certain feel that is 'rave'. We all know
things fragmented and went back to the clubs and thus a regression took
place and stagnation set in. I personally don't care what it takes to
reinvent things and get to where we were 3-4 yrs. ago, but in a new and
evolved way. It's not important to me what moniker is created to identify
this 'new scene', even if they are still called 'raves' it's all just
semantics to me. The important thing is the evolution of the music, culture
and social aspects really DOES happen. Re-create the creativity and gains
will be made.

On a related note...   wtf ever happened to the list party that was supposed
to come together last year.  We even had a seperate list for it.   And it
was like "ok, you, do this, who's gonna do this, I'll take care of this...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} fd2 - reward offered-

One part of evolving and improving things would be for people to stop
idiotic fucking behavior like this and actually show the scene, themselves
and the rest of the world a reasonable level of respect... think of what
kind of progress THAT would bring. If we can go a full weekend without crap
like this we could def. pat ourselves on the back and say we took a step
forward. If we could actually use a venue year after year and be appreciated
by those who own them. Fat chance, huh??? I'm sorry to here about this Matt,
I hope these clowns get a clue someday.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Field Day 2 review

ok.  I'm not going to get into a fight with you over this.  My slot was
changed from 4 to 5 on the main to 3 to 4.  But whatever, my suggestion
wasn't meant to insult you, it was meant as a suggestion.  I would look for
space (bearcreek) that allows you to play all night at reasonable levels.
Having the exact same problem over and over again isn't solving anything.

No attitude here, please don't think that.  You should be able to accept
some criticism of the event.  I don't spend my time looking for gigs and
trying to dj all over.  I do spend my time working hard on the sets that I
do play.  If I put in over 40 hours on something and have no output, it is
dissapointing, for me as well as anyone in this predicament.  I didn't ask
you to remove anyone and let me play instead.  I didn't do this last time
either.  I think that is a unfair judgement, that you are certainly entitled
to.  I only do this for the music and I hope that comes across.  I will
leave it there.  It's not worth the effort to defend myself.

/hope you all like this drama ;p

p.s.  I received a ton of what I think are virus attachments from lots of
emails so look out.

You cannot become a positive thinker,
unless you have abundant love in your
heart. You cannot be positive towards
people and events, unless love flows
from you unconditionally and engulfs
everything that comes in your way.
--------------------------------------------------
On this path
effort never goes to waste,
and there is no failure. Even a little effort
toward spiritual awareness will protect you
from the greatest fear. (the gita 2:40)

Thick D - Insatiable (Matrix remix)
Calibre - Makes Me Wonder 
Konsta (aka Muffler) - What I need 
Calibre, Beta2 + Zero Tolerance - Riverside

The problem I see is that we aren't bringing any interest from the younger 
crowds and that is the biggest thing killing our scene.  Eventually these 
things are just going to end up as reunion parties.  I mean, really, if you 
were a teenager, would you have wanted to hang out with a bunch of old 
people that don't really sociallize with you.  I wouldn't, and thats exactly 
what I see going on.  We stopped embracing youth in our scene as soon as we 
brought our scene to clubs and bars and now we're going to pay for it.

becasue obviously catering to people who dont know their ass from
a hole in the ground is very important. kids react to trends in a
fairly predictable manner. older people much less so. why cater to
people who will just jump ship when something "new" comes along?
why not try to cement long term relationships with people who
actually care about similar ideas and ideals?

I disagree, we were all young when we got into the scene and it sure seemed 
like everything was being catered to me and everyone around me, I'm pretty 
sure that's what pulled so many people into the scene to begin with.  It was 
a comfortable scene where everyone was on the same level.  I don't feel that 
at all anymore.  Progression and creativity can be a good thing, but with 
the wrong atmosphere around it, people are going to walk away.

TEEN NIGHTS.

We need nightclubs to do non-alcoholic teen nights... with experienced djs
serving up the top 40 that the kiddies want but who are willing to introduce
new music to them!

I'm not even going to try to say I know for sure what the scene needs right 
now, but it really sucks when I meet teenagers around my neighborhood who 
are interested in hearing my music but can't go out and see me play.  Also, 
for kids that might be interested in becoming a Dj, what kind of incentive 
do they have if they can't play out anywhere.  And those are the kids that 
bring in a younger crowd.  I've seen it at Annabell's.  Whenever I bring 
down a younger Dj, they almost always are out there promoting themselves to 
all their friends.  Those have been some of the freshest nights I've seen in 
a long time. I just wish I had a better venue to represent our scene to 
whatever youth that comes down.  I'm not trying to crack on all us old men 
dj's but we have pretty much tapped our generation for all it's worth.  
There isn't too many older dj's that are continually developing new fans.  
What would be nice is to see all the veterans take some younger dj's and 
help them get established.  That is why I started doing annabell's in the 
first place, because I was sick of a few crews monopolizing the scene.  I 
think everyone needs to be given a chance and just because you have an 
established name that doesn't mean you don't need to work as hard as the guy 
below you, you should work harder.

I think this is pretty much 100% accurate, without new blood there will be
no evolution. The trick is finding the RIGHT people... young, creative,
people who are looking to express themselves and explore. Not followers or
those who are just there cuz it's 'cool' who just move on from one
established trend to another. Musicians are the key... if you get enough
young peeps with fresh ideas the metamorphosis is inevitable. Most of us
have been doing this too long and are simply beyond the youthful period of
discovery that needs to exist for growth.

this is taken out of the brilliant mushroom magazine by Kai Mathesdorf.
its really worth a read, and maybe some comments would be useful about where 
you think trance is heading today, especially with the full on and 
progressive genres diverging so much...


"To travel in India means letting yourself fall into its craziness, to 
understand its surreal chaos, or to at least be driven by it. Therefore 
India has always been a country with a multitude of facettes, which has been 
less explored by tourists than other Asian countries. On this continent 
within a continent lies Goa, on the west coast approximately 600 km south of 
Bombay. Goa is a State and not an island as many believe, which had been a 
Portugese colony until 1962. Due to this Goa has a Christian influence and 
differs to other Indian areas in terms of liberties, religious tolerance and 
cultural diversity. Because of its climate - the average temperature is 
between 20 and 34 degrees - its nearly untouched beaches and the almost 
unbeatable value for money in contrast to western cultures, this stretch of 
land has been an international meeting place of new agers, mystics, those on 
the search of spirituality and truth, of anarchists, new age philosophers, 
outlaws, drug dealers and famous freaks such as Eight Finger Eddie. Friendly 
locals openly took up the visitors, thus a paradise built up for jet-set 
hippies and low-cost travellers, connected by the fact of having a position 
outside the conventional western society, to spend time away from cold 
European or American winters, all here to pursue the beautiful and intense 
sides of life. This went well and unnoticed for quite a while, charas for 
instance, the Indian hash, was part of religious practices and life styles 
of the yogis and sadhus, as well as part of Indian culture. Only in the mid 
seventies did the US government intervene to make it an illegal 
substance.Along with the party mad freaks of course came music of the time 
like psychedelic rock and later reggae. Especially flown in generators and 
sound systems meant these parties happening on beaches and in palm forests 
gained in energy and importance for the scene, there even were psychedelic 
theatre performances on the beach. Decorations made of flourescent colours 
and Indian mythology became an increasing part of life in Goa. In the season 
of 87/88 a French DJ named Laurent had the idea to play electronic sounds at 
a party. At first this brought him hefty opposition, but sometime the spark 
turned into a fire, and this bizarre electronic music hit with lasting 
impressions in the context of this paradise.
Other people also caught on to this and recognised the immense potential of 
electronic music in this from time and space relieved place. DJ Goa Gil came 
as early as the 1970s from California to Goa with his guitar and eventually 
became the most successful protagonist of psychedelic electronic dance, 
sustaining that to this day. Equal to a legend he created a connection 
between beats and spirituality, yoga and music, with his concept of 
redefining the ancient tribal ritual for the 21st century, to guide him 
and the crowd through the trance dance experience into a higher state of 
consciousness."
In the beginning it was still difficult to obtain appropriate music - the 
DJs mixed instrumental- and dub-versions from the b-sides of Wave and 
Electro tracks with edited and sequenced instrumental parts of various dance 
tracks from tape played on pitchable Sony Walkmen, due to the heat and dust 
Goa was never a suitable place for vinyl. The music developed into a 
colourful mixture of Post-Wave, Electronic Body Music, New Beat, Front 242, 
Nitzer Ebb, ranging from Belgian, English and American electronic dance 
music. The early beginnings of Acid and the entailing Techno hit the crowds 
like water does the thirsty Indian cow. In this place no one cared what 
music was played from which ever tradition, Techno musicians had no idea 
what was being made out of their music here in Goa. It was an explosion and 
implosion, because this scene was constantly in motion. As Goa became 
intolerably hot for westerners by April and with the entailing rain season 
going on until August not being desirable, freaks returned as a matter of 
course to their home countries and spread this part of party culture and 
music, in order to carry new influences to India for the next season. At 
this time Goa developed from a music historical perspective into one of the 
most innovative centres on earth and formed a pool of electronic music, 
because the aid of walkmen and later digital audio technology (Digital Audio 
Tape = DAT) led to free copying of music and a constant exchange of musical 
ideas. The international consistency of the crowd in Goa meant this wasnt 
just one scenes meeting place, rather for people of all social groups a 
universal frequency freeway (DJ Ray Castle).

The enormous palette of possibilities that resulted from the 1980s era, to 
create psychedelic music with the help of computers and synthesizers, caused 
a creative overflow by the meeting of global players that spread unlimited 
around over the planet. Musicians such as Johann Bley, beforehand drummer in 
the Hamburgian band Ledernacken and later part of the English band Juno 
Reactor, brought computers to Goa, danced through the night and realised 
their musical experiences on the next day, in order to dance to this new 
sound the next night. From the continuing coming together of different 
people of various regions and musical backgrounds a more and more individual 
style developed that eventually became known as Goa-Trance. Goas reputation 
as a highend-hippie-paradise increased and drew more and more travellers and 
crazy ones, until the energy became ultimately borderless; Australian Ollie 
Wisdom (Space Tribe) flooded the scene with huge amounts of psychedelic 
consciousness, his brother founded the associated clothing label for full on 
psychedelic wear and ultraviolet orgasms.


..CONTINUED... (Part 3)
Back with his experiences from Goa it was Johann, together with his party 
mate Youth, until then known as partner of Alex Paterson in the Ambient and 
Electro project The Orb and as bass player in the Wave-Rock band Killing 
Joke, who released the first official Goa dance track. The track was 
Jungle High released on Paul Oakenfolds Perfecto label and was a massive 
chart success in England. Inspired by this Youth formed the first 
Psychedelic Trance label ever. He utilised the structures and recording 
studio of his Butterfly label and suitably named his new child Dragonfly. 
This label shortly became the first human resource and brain pool of the 
London Goa scene, Ronald Rothfield produced here, flutist of the legendary 
jazz-formation Quintessence better known as Raja Ram together with Graham 
Wood made the first tracks under The Infinity Project. Simon Posford made 
his break here and from Butterfly sound engineer became Hallucinogen. The 
first release by Dragonfly came out in May 1993 and was a sampler featuring 
artists such as Genetic, Gumbo, TIP and Black Sun. The second compilation 
Project II Trance in August of the same year already included tracks by 
the French Total Eclipse and the Mandra Gora tracks by Johann and Youth. In 
the following year more singles followed and first tracks by Hallucinogen. 
Man With No Name (Martin Freeland), Prana (Japanese Tsuyoshi Suzuki and 
Australian Nick Taylor), Ayahuasca (amongst others Dino Psaras today A&R for 
Atomic), Slinky Wizard and Doof (today on Twisted), and already the initial 
Order Odonata compilation.

During this year the English Psy-Trance-party-scene developed rapidly, party 
collectives such as Return To The Source formed and parallel a whole label 
scene was quickly taking shape. Raja Ram and Graham Wood founded a label 
under their own project name, called TIP in short, Pranas Tsuyoshi Suzuki 
created with John Perloff and Matsuri a label for headbanging stuff between 
experimental Techno and Trance with releases by Transwave, Digitalis and 
Quirk, the Slinky Wizard boys James Monro, Dominic Lamb and George Barker 
founded Flying Rhino Records with Sally Welch as label manager. Simon Berry 
established Platipus Records - the first release was by the way a vinyl by 
Technossomy alias James Monro - and is acclaimed for the out licensing of 
the most successful Trance chart stormer of all times with Robert Miles 
Children track, as well as ground breaking albums for instance Union 
Jacks There will be no Armageddon (1996) featuring Trance anthems Red 
Herring and Cactus.


Part 4
Blue Room Released became one of the most brilliant and at the same time 
mysterious labels. Led by Simon Ghahary Blue Room understood itself as a 
truly innovative label, from its beginnings concerned with expanding the 
musical concept beyond goa-kitsh or hippie-romantic. Financially well backed 
up, because set up as sign-off project for a Swiss loudspeaker company, 
irrespectively of costs or sales figures the scenes most innovative acts 
were signed and distributed in brilliant designs around the blue planet. In 
April 1995 Outside The Reactor was the first compilation to be released as 
a triple LP and CD presenting a world wide trance overview featuring for 
instance Spectral, Total Eclipse, Moog, Har-Ell, Voodoo People and Total 
Eclipses master piece Nautilus. In the same year debut albums were 
released by Total Eclipse, The Infinity Project and Ben Watkins co-project 
Juno Reactor (with Beyond the Infinite including 8 tracks on four LPs). 
The out standing logo consisted of a doubled bass key, becoming thereof the 
icon of the scene. Following a brilliant start on German labels such as Gaia 
and Tunnel Records, the Hamburg based band X-Dream found a suiting home. 
Following an Etnica album, X-Dreams The Frog single and the second stroke 
of genius Violent Relaxation by Total Eclipse, in 1996 the height of the 
Blue Room and psychedelic trance was reached, culminating in further 
releases with Junos Bible of Dreams, Saafi Bros. Mystic Cigarettes and 
the at the same time released ground breaking X-Dream remix of Internal 
Code Error, the Delta single As a Child, further releases by Noosphere 
and Johann and the Dragon Tales album by Kox Box.

Although England had been leading the Trance music scene for years, due to 
its superbly developed independent music structure, the party scene had been 
restricted on the island by the Criminal Justice Bill and was almost 
non-existent. Out door parties, which are an elementary requirement of a 
proper Trance experience, were not possible and club life was damped down 
and demoralised by early closing hours.

Meanwhile Germanys liberal laws and the newly reunified east sparked a 
party paradise, which again had a strong effect on the musical development 
and success of German productions. With Spirit Zone in Hamburg there had 
already been a German Psy-Trance label since 1994, that after international 
releases by Kuro from Japan, TIP from England, Etnica from Italy and Har-Ell 
from Israel gave locals the space for releasing music such as Electric 
Universe, PsyPhy6, Ololiuqui, Star Sound Orchestra and S.U.N. Project.


Part 5
Goas fame spread around the world; in suit of this more and more tourists 
came - from 1994 to 98 there were four times as many visitors. Hence the 
long cultivated relationship between travellers and local tipped off 
balance, money became increasingly important, as the Indians and the police 
grasped the financial potential that flowed persistently into their land. 
The original spirit of Goa was gone like smoke in a few years, the 
brotherhood gave way to ego-thinkers, territorial disputes and ignorance.

At this time the Psy Trance progression stood at its height, everything had 
become larger and fatter, the Voov-Experience (by Antaro and Scotty) and the 
Shiva Moon (by Jan Engel with Scotty, later with Waldheims Ernst and 
finally all alone) reached visitor number above the 10,000 mark for the 
first time. With the since 93 permanently grown Antaris Project, many 
smaller organisers and the Lovefield many more Parties and Festivals 
appeared on the scene, resulting in the formation of a complete Germany 
party summer. The mainstream, media and companies became aware of the 
phenomena Goa, event though its peak in content had passed. Blinded by 
success many prime freaks mutated to arrogant, self indulgent assholes, many 
DJs behaved as god-like. In short: the decadence did finally get a foot in 
the door to the spirit, even though no one had thought about this wonderful 
new world finding the same end as other musical developments previously had 
done. In October 1997 Matsuri marked the end of Goa-Trance with the 
compilation Let it R.I.P. (Rest In Peace). Sales had suddenly dropped, and 
the collapse of the English distribution Flying tore up a deep gap into the 
label scene. Almost all English labels werent being payed out and generally 
had a hard time surviving bankruptcy, or resurfaced under a different name 
and company, as in the case of TIP Records and TIP World.

Parallel to passing the zenith of classical Psychedelic Goa Trance new 
concepts and projects developed, which reduced the overt effects and immense 
tempi and rather focussing on groove and beat, combining elements of 
Club-Trance, Techno and House. In Germany there had already formed a 
functional musician and producer scene around acts such as Digital 
Sun/Tarsis (Sebastian Krger and Linus Wessel), Ouija (SUN Project and 
various DJs), Earth (DJ Sangeet), Ololiuqui, Shiva Chandra and many more. 
With the Voov-Experience as the annual meeting point this development was 
quickly taken across the continent by 97/98. Many Swedish having become 
infected by this music found their own progressive interpretations. The 
first and best known of them is Tomasz Balicki, who after initial 
productions as Mato Project together with Magnus Andersson (lately 
successful as Noma) started a furious solo career as Atmos. Through a single 
release on Eve Records (Eve26 Body Trance) he made contact with Cass 
Cutbush, who together with James Monro was undergoing a restructuring of 
Flying Rhino. Atmos track Klein Aber Doctor and the simultaneously 
released number Confusional State by Pete Slide Martin on the 3rd 
Flight Slipstream compilation marked the most successful releases by Flying 
Rhino to that date; the Confusional State single sold over 5,000 copies. 
The new sound once again hit the pulse of the time and gave the scene a 
lasting boost to reach new shores. Even conservative labels such as 
Dragonfly set on this new sound, in Sweden DJ Antis label Spiral Trax 
mutated to an epi-center of Progressive Trance. Atmos debut album, Noma and 
S-Range (previously with initial releases on Medium Records) became 
milestones. After the release of a first album on Novatekk the band Son Kite 
from Malm launched a further large and successful platform for Swedish 
sound with the MPDQX Labelgroup - Digital Structures and Baluns.

Backed by this output Progressive Trance expanded rapidly; ever more minimal 
bands appeared on the psychedelic world map, whereby regional differences in 
scenes and music structures formed, and so the term for off-beat trance 
Hamburg Sound went down in history. Progressive Psy Trance was also 
evolving outside of Europe."

what was being catered to wasnt "young" people, it was

people were walking away the more young irresponsible idiots
started showing up all the time. it was a comfortable scene when
most people were on the same page. the large influx of people
changed the page, but fortunately most of them just went away to
something different, leaving the same old people who lasted that
long to be the ones doing stuff today.

theres enough "dance mixes" being played at mainstream (and im
guessing "teen" clubs, ive never been to one). theres also plenty
of mainstream mags that cover the most mainstream electronic
music. MTV is playing that Junior Senior video to death. if the
youngsters cant get into it from that, i think its just too damn
bad for them. really, reaching out more is only inviting less
dedicated people to help screw things up again.

>I'm not even going to try to say I know for sure what the scene
needs right 
>now

i will. it needs more emphasis on quality, not quantity. people
still look at dance music as a joke and with people like paul
oakenfold, sasha + dickweed, dick van dyk, etc being so popular,
its not really hard to understand why that is. there are roads
into and out of dance music from basically any other pop genre.
alot of hiphop people are into house music, but not progressive
house. theyre also into broken beat but not florida breaks.
obviously right now jungle is trying to appeal to more
punk/metal/hardcore folks, and thats probably good for them.
getting people to recognise dance music as good music isnt going
to happen by reaching for that lowest common denominator. which is
why appealing to trend hopping kids is pretty much irrelevant. you
have to spread dance music through people who actually care about
good music and it will start having an effect on the number of
people coming into the scene. 

>but it really sucks when I meet teenagers around my neighborhood who 
>are interested in hearing my music but can't go out and see me play.

then organise something. it doesnt have to be a rave. i can
remember going to free things in schenley park even very recently
that happened during the day time with deejays and people just
hanging out. that was some high quality shit. 

>Also, 
>for kids that might be interested in becoming a Dj, what kind of
incentive 
>do they have if they can't play out anywhere. 

before i was 21 i deejayed in 21+ clubs. im pretty sure it was
legal as well. really if you need other peoples' approval to be a
deejay, you probably shouldnt be a deejay in the first place. 

>And those are the kids that 
>bring in a younger crowd.  I've seen it at Annabell's.  Whenever
I bring 
>down a younger Dj, they almost always are out there promoting
themselves to 
>all their friends. 

self promotion amongst kids is usually pretty good. thats how weak
punk bands become huge within their own high schools. how much of
that actually pans out into dedicated music fans is probably
pretty slim. shit, i can remember when we were in high school
doing events, we had lots of support from lots of people. almost
none of them go out to dance music nights now. 

>I'm not trying to crack on all us old men 
>dj's but we have pretty much tapped our generation for all it's
worth.  

are you kidding? shit, the deejay i look up to are all much older
than me. francious kevorkian, derrick may, theo parrish, etc.
those guys have experience and dedication. kids cant just pick up
what theyre putting down. 

>There isn't too many older dj's that are continually developing
new fans.  

i dont think that is true either. sadly, the best music isnt the
most publicised so theres always room for it to grow. see the DEMF
for proof. they mix the older deejays with the good younger ones
and everyone loves all of it. 

>What would be nice is to see all the veterans take some younger
dj's and

annabell's in the

>think everyone needs to be given a chance and just because you
have an 
>established name that doesn't mean you don't need to work as hard
as the guy 
>below you, you should work harder.

this is probably true, but i know ive never gotten any flack from
older people in the scene, but thats probably because i am
obviously as dedicated as they are. im not just some joker trying
to win a popularity contest. i dont think too many kids are like
that otherwise theyd stick around........

this is exactly right. and thats why i think that too much
catering to young kids who dont care isnt going to solve anything.
the channels and avenues are there right now for young people who
are driven to do something big. they just have to step up. 

>Musicians are the key... if you get enough
>young peeps with fresh ideas the metamorphosis is inevitable.

i dont know if "musicians" are the key. listening to trained
musicians try to do dance music can often times be painful. if you
mean "people making their own tunes" then youve hit the nail on
the head. you dont have to be a "musician" to make good dance
tunes, and thats a good thing. 

>Most of us

period of

i think that is just false. i have great new ideas every day, and
have had them for years.

yeah, and so did peter, the founder of the christian
church, hell, the guys who started this country even
went so far as to forceably take over another
continent in order to do this; everybody does this,
not just the famous mr. hitler.

anyway, citing hitler just doesnt pack the punch
anymore, since everbody does it all the time. somebody
has to figure out a new shock-word.

A short review...

All the heads on this list will be happy to know that the 
psy-goa-progressive scene was very well represented at this 
multi-stage/style event in Wooster, Ohio. Thanks to all the psy, goa & 
progressive dj's/crews who came from all over to the Goahead tent: 
Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus (I hope I didn't miss anyone's origins). 
Because of them, any unsuspecting raver with a binky on a string at that 
event could hear these sounds that we all love and enjoy, and even take for 
granted here in the city. Be it daytime, peak-time or morning. Every time 
a psy, goa or progressive DJ would get behind the decks, a crowd would 
gather around and get really excited. Who knows, maybe the house nation is 
starting to get a crack in it's foundation, because one could easily tell 
the kids are just dying for a new sound (all other stages played house, 
d'n'b, house, cheesy trance, house and more house, oh experimental stage was 
great tho too). Two obstacles hindered the event from being all it was 
meant to be: rain and the subsequent flooding and mud; and of course, the 
man. After 2 am, the bass was supposed to be off entirely until 8 am. Good 
thing toward the morning most of the stages said fuck it, and kicked it back 
up. This event has the potential of becoming a staple in the 
north-east/mid-west scene. It reminded me a lot of what Toronto crews do 
with WEMF, my hope is that Field Day will continue to grow and attract 
bigger crowds. That rests in part on the shoulders of the promoters who 
this year went in with the complete understanding that they will be picking 
up the tab. And they did. That is a community service worth praise. Props 
to Goahead Productions for representing all the way. They are planning 
quite a bit for the future of goa, psy & progressive in those parts. If 
anyone has any ideas on how to participate, be it with DJ's, art, tour 
bookings, var. connects, taking trips to events or whatever, let's hear it. 
I think there is a certain responsibility that we have before the rest of 
the region, being in NYC and having a thriving scene as we do. I don't 
wanna come off too utopian, but we are a movement only when we get together 
and make things happen, collaboratively and sometimes over distances (in 
this case only 7.5 hrs drive). To sum up though, the event was a kick ass 
time and an indication of good things to come for trance in that neck of the 
woods.

Tha reason were not bringing any interest from younger age groups is cuz we have all (collectively) determined that most of tha e-puddles consist of these said younger groups.  Tha groups that dont care for music only drugs.  Not to say that all these younger kids are this way, but I have noticed tha new ppl are brought in by tha lure of drugs, and dancing themselves into a stupor.   This is just simple fact.
 
And I'm not being a hypocrite.  MOST (not all) of you all started "raving" for that reason. (drugs)  Myself included.

were a teenager, would you have wanted to hang out with a bunch of old 
people that don't really sociallize with you. I wouldn't, and thats exactly 
what I see going on. We stopped embracing youth in our scene as soon as we 
brought our scene to clubs and bars and now we're going to pay for it.

I disagree 100%. Hitler was VERY interested in the children. The older 
people were somewhat irrelevant in his eyes. The kids could be molded and 
trained to do what he wanted. He saw them as integral to the future, and 
what he wanted to accomplish.

I am not trying to get into any major discussion about nazi youth, and I am 
not praising his actions by any means. I am just saying that I think you 
might have your facts mixed a little, Donnie.

Raving as it is now is non-existant.  Parties with electronic music are everywhere tho, and we can make them up ourselves too.   Look at CDG3 - that was awesome... small, but awesome.   And from what I hear FD2 was just as good.  Probably better due to talent and just sheer length and quality.  Tha thing is, we cant have it go back to how it was.  That time has passed.  People have moved on.  Tha love for music will last forever, but to many, raving was a "spiritual" world so to speak, that had a time and place... and it is finished.
 
Tha government and local police have seen to it that we cannot continue to have tha "scene" we once had.  Tha RAVE Act scares tha living shit out of a lot of promoters.  Thats what its designed to do.  Upon tha passage of that damned ACT which was stuffed into some fuckn pork by some dickhead congressman, I declared surrender.  I think everyone should too.   I know its good to "fight tha power", I'd like to think we all do.  But, theres just NO WAY to have it be what it once was.  People are gone.  Promoters are afraid.  Tha music can transcend it all into clubs, but tha "Rave Scene" is gone.
 
Wave your white flag.  Its over.  Lets just get together and dance to some good techno, shall we?  Like the bloody Brits. lol
 
peace.

Yesterday I saw a sign advertising an under 21 night at the club underneath 
the old Milk Records. I don't know who is doing the music there though.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RAVE: R.I.P. 1990-2000 

I agree that more attention needs to be dedicated to drawing young folks toward the music. But I don't think that's the singular variable leading to the scene's decline. 

Older people, who in my opinion could benefit more significantly and in a more revolutionary way from the values of the scene and all its attributes, also need to be brought in. For each, there should be different approaches.

Part of our problem may be that we bundle our "music" and our "scene" together as though they are a prepackaged and inseparable Value Meal. In our post-lifechanging rave elder minds, if we want kids to get into the music, we think that our solution must be to send them to rave camp. What ends up happening? The other elements of the scene take priority over the music and then we wonder why nobody listens to us any more. (Field Day, anyone?) If we want people to listen to music, give them just music.

Who can blame the younger kids, though? Who at house parties or field trips or band camp growing up spent more time making out in the back seat of the bus instead of the real reason they were sent there? That's to be expected of kids those ages. We can't blame them for losing interest or growing out of it because that's to be expected as people mature. 

If the scene is to survive, it needs to position itself as the "end goal" or some other sort of evolution of something that people achieve as maturity sets in and as it can be adopted as a sort of way of life, not the rite of passage itself. I don't doubt that raves can be a significant rite of passage for young people, but I'm not sure it's the rite that should happen in adolescence. 

I disagree with some of you who would say that bringing the scene to the club level has totally killed it. While it has diminished many parts of it, which I HATE, it has enabled a big part of it, the music, to carry on where it may otherwise not have had the chance to survive if it were dependent exclusively on risky one-offs. While I would agree that most club experiences are shitty and not at all resembling a family-type atmosphere that most of us embrace, many of us work really, really, really hard to keep it true to a lot of the values we love about the scene. (ahem. Sean Cusick is this Saturday. Twilo, anyone?)

I'll tell you this: I have had more true rave-like experiences with good, solid, older, educated, genuine, kind, embracing, diverse people at "club" parties in different cities the past three years than I have at any other non-club event. Quite a few of the people were veterans; there were also quite a few newbies.

I used to think that 21+ sucked, but after throwing a summer's worth of headlining parties and going to underage parties also, I really don't think it's such a bad idea. It saves something important for folks for when they are old enough to handle it and when it may actually have some MEANING for them. Yeah it sucks that it keeps music away from them, but I think the solution is to get the music to them in other ways, be creative, don't rely so much on the "rave" concept as it has always existed. We must evolve.

Ultimately introducing kids to all elements of the scene at a young age will mean that they drop out when they're older. If we bring them in when they're older, then we have a more stable flow from generation to generation. I'm not saying we shouldn't embrace youth; I'm saying we should embrace youth in ways that are appropriate for youth, and that we should also embrace older people in ways that are appropriate to embrace them.

i:have become my mother and my father.

Commence flames.

The problem I see is that we aren't bringing any interest from the younger 
crowds and that is the biggest thing killing our scene. Eventually these 
things are just going to end up as reunion parties. I mean, really, if you 
were a teenager, would you have wanted to hang out with a bunch of old 
people that don't really sociallize with you. I wouldn't, and thats exactly 
what I see going on. We stopped embracing youth in our scene as soon as we 
brought our scene to clubs and bars and now we're going to pay for it.

1. Hitler did kill a few million Jews, not tried.

2. You said "why not try to cement long term relationships with people who
     actually care about similar ideas and ideals?"  The Nazi's had "ideas"
for
     a similar race.  Hitler thought this race was "ideal".  Your little
quote was
     probably taken from one of Hitler's speeches.

3.  Bringing people together with similar ideas and ideals to party, again
     your thoughts on the issue,  sounds a lot like those skinhead fucks who
     have wet dreams of ruling the world.

4.  "i hope you get socked"  come on you can say something more threaten
     than that!  That's just like saying "I'm going to give you a knuckle
     sandwich buster!"

Sincerely,

The dumb motherfucker, fucking idiot, who said something so fucking stupid.

that would likely be the shady bastards who caused that to be the site of

not really the kind of place i'd want MY under 21 to go...
don't know if i'd hold out too much hope for that as an up and coming venue.

Here's my answers for alternatives to introducing kids to EDM:

Pirate radio.  Just get a bunch of people together and pirate radio every
club event with good talent.  Those little fuckers listen to the radio all
the time.  wouldnt it be just funny if you started broadcasting on 107.9 in
cleveland at a high watt level for a couple hours?  kids wouldnt know what
the hell was going on, but it would introduce them to something new.  (okay,
it's not a feasible idea, but it's something)

DJ's:
If you have a little extra capital, drop off 50/100 mix cd's to your local
record shop.  record store owners: give out these mix cd's to anyone making
a purchase that is under 21.  give 2 or 3 to those under 18, but give it
with other promotional material.  start supporting the scene and in every
record bag, stuff it with flyers for upcoming events 21+, 18+, whatever.
promoters take the time out to help out the record stores.  if you live by a
mall, you know those little fuckers hang out there, hand out some cd's
outside of sam goody or whatever... give em to the teenage girls that look
like they have friends... teenage girls will get teenage boys to like things
if they like them, it's just natural law.  Teenagers love free shit,
expecially if it has decent graphics, if they dont like the music, they wont
come, but then again, did you want them for the music or for the capital?
exactly.

i still think that promoters/dj's need to form collectives in their metro
areas where they can combine their forces for good or for awesome and come
up with new innovative ways to grow the culture and share the joys we have
all found in EDM.

what the fuck are you talking about? no seriously, do you have any

>Older people, who in my opinion could benefit more significantly
and in a more revolutionary way from the values of the scene and
all its attributes, also need to be brought in. 

thats what im saying. adults are in more of a position to give and
take from a "Scene" as opposed to just take take take like kids
(for the most part) do. 

>Who can blame the younger kids, though? Who at house parties or
field trips or band camp growing up spent more time making out in
the back seat of the bus instead of the real reason they were sent
there? That's to be expected of kids those ages. We can't blame
them for losing interest or growing out of it because that's to be
expected as people mature. 

i think its dangerous to just write off kids like they cant be
doing anything more meaningful than trend hopping. i believe in
holding high expectations for those people, but they always let me
down. 

>If the scene is to survive, it needs to position itself as the
"end goal" or some other sort of evolution of something that
people achieve as maturity sets in and as it can be adopted as a
sort of way of life, not the rite of passage itself. 

i dont think i subscribe to any sort of lifestyle or whatever as a
result of my taking part in the dance music scene. like any 23
year old i go out to bars, but instead of going to hunt for
females and listen to bad rock/pop, i like to relax with my
friends and listen to deep music. its not a foreign concept that
is going to challenge peoples' morality or social standards. 

>I don't doubt that raves can be a significant rite of passage for
young people, but I'm not sure it's the rite that should happen in
adolescence. 

there are plenty of psychadelic rituals that are common in
indigenous peoples throughout the world that are definitely
related to the idea of raves. i think there are just other factors
at work that dont allow teenagers to experience things the way
they should. advertising is aimed at children from the moment they
can first start to think a thought on their own. over protective
parents hide their children from the "bad" things, increasing
temptation to abuse those things. the list can go on and on. its
not necessarily the fact that it is young kids who cant handle the
idea of rave culture, but more like the kids in our society who
cant handle it at that age. 

>While I would agree that most club experiences are shitty and not
at all resembling a family-type atmosphere that most of us embrace

i guess that all depends on what clubs youre going to. this has to
do with my "quality over quantity" policy. 100 crap clubs arent
going to do as much good for dance music as 1 really great club will. 

>Ultimately introducing kids to all elements of the scene at a
young age will mean that they drop out when they're older. If we
bring them in when they're older, then we have a more stable flow
from generation to generation. 

thats what im talking about. the idea isnt to just get anybody and
his brother out to the club. the goal should be to get good
quality people with good ideas and an open mind and a serious
taste for music.

What about Pol Pot killing off 1.7 million of his own citizens?
Or the armenian genocide led by their oligarchial triumurate, that was
almost 2 million of their own people leading to the end of the Ottoman
empire?

There are plenty of genocide stories out there, picking hitler because it's
what is more taught in school (no jewish money influence there) doesn't cut
it.  Think of all the good things hitler did.  He had the right
organization, just the wrong plan.  You just need to use the right
organization for the right plan.

Organization of people with common interests is not nazism or elitism or
anything like that... it's trying to make something work through organized
effort.  you can draw whatever parallels you want, but then there is a
counterargument for something that isnt controversial at the same time.

having a management system in business is nazi because it's organized,
right?  no, it's just an efficient way to get people on the same page.  the
same goes for why you have HR... to make sure you have persons that can work
together in the right environments...

organization is not bad when you are just trying to create a culture that
has similar interests.  you make it out to be like some delusional
schizophrenic central intelligence agency conspiracy... *cough*

There was a time on this list that
Hitler signaled the end of a thread.
I think that would be the best proposition
in this case.

Pol Pot killed 1.7 million Cambodians and died under house arrest and the
only thing to say about it really is...

"Well done there"

Nobody cares if you kill your own people, cause we've been trying to kill
you for ages.  The thing is...Hitler killed people next door.  Stupid
man...after a couple of years we won't stand for that.

	Last few teen clubs i remember being to definately introduced new 
music too them, but it was the EDM kind. The only thing that came close 
was Kernkraft 400 and Sandstorm and a few others, which they played on 
a average of once a night. Disgraceful.

	Blame the record companies. This is a rock n roll society that needs 
sing a long songs, otherwise theyre no good. Someone needs to bring 
Skibadee to some teen club and see if they can sing along then.

I was in the back right but didn't notice them.  I just wanted to
mention that I seriously fought the urge to climb up that dirt mound in
the back left with my cherokee.  I sort of knew better though, I didn't
see any children, but I knew it was inconsiderate to tear up the place
anymore than we had already.

I will offer a reward to anyone who can provide any information on the 
owners of the three import vehicles who cut across the field Sunday
morning 
into the campgrounds.  The vehicles were parked to the very back left of
the 
venue and consisted of what I believe to be a Volkswagen gti, Mitsu
eclipse 
and a car of another make.  The vehicles cut across the field and
proceeded 
to do donuts and speed through out the campground where children were at

play.  If anyone has information on the owners of the vehicles it will
be 
appreciated.  You identity will of course remain confidential.  Many
stupid 
ignorant acts took place this weekend which I let slide but the
endangering 
of children is something that will not go without some type of
retribution.

ehhh! sorry, meant to say was NOT the EDM kind

Anyways. the best thing to do to get new kids in is do joint genre 
events. Ive seen it before. Bring rappers or something they recognize 
alongside some DnB n Breaks, or whatever. Double the amount of mix CDs 
you hand out, and give out copies to kids who might be interested. Shit 
if you were desperate you could just dump 1000 party fliers at a high 
skewl. haha The possibilities are endless.

Subject: {pb-cle} What can we do now?

I'm ready to go get something new going for this fall.  If anyone wants to 
help out or has any ideas/possible venues, hit me up.  I know the Akron 
crowd is down to support a good weekly but what about any other areas?

Matt

Word up ed, definately some good points. But pirate radio, oooohhhh. 
Well shit, why doesnt someone get interested and do the real deal. The 
last real EDM station I remember was when that guy that owned the Grid 
did a small broadcast for awhile (4 or so years ago?) and had my 
attention, but he eventually go kicked off the air or not enough funds 
or something. Anyone with a budget out there listening?

This brings to mind a question I've had for a while.  Why don't more 
organizers post here asking for volunteers?  I can count on one hand the 
number of times that I can remember this happening over the 2+ years I've 
been lurking on this list.

The main issues I can think of are:
You might want some way to filter out the people who are just interested 
in getting their name on a list or something.
It's nice to know the people helping out beforehand.

These issues might be addressed by holding open planning meetings before 
the event which prospective volunteers would come to.

The simple facts can be seen in any era of music, fashion, or progressing culture in this nation.  Every music has its time, every culture has its era, the rave scene, just as any other progressing entity, will move into a new form.  There is no longer a true underground.  Mtv and the multiple laws being placed will make sure of that.  This is evolving, just as any other event.  The hippies evolved, a movement that cannot be compared to.  The undergound was a time, a small movement of freedom and trust (to an extent).  This is no longer the case.  We do not have the allowances which made it possible for what took place 5, 6, 7, hell 10 years ago.  Parties are no longer truely held in an abandon warehouse, open field, or some other benign venue, hidden away from the eyes of the world.  We have been exposed.  Our styles have been placed on racks in dillards and kaufmanns, transformed into the glamour fashions of today.  Our music is now on billboard charts and radio stations that are
 owned and operated by multi-billion dollar, blue chip companies.  The evolution is in full effect and we are hanging onto events we do not want to forget.  The past is in our past.....
This leaves us one option:  Embrace the future and help shape what we believe so proudly in....
 
One Question Remains....
 
........What are we going to do, sit here and complain or work for a future we are in control of once again.
 
Thank you for listening,

>Older people, who in my opinion could benefit more significantly
and in a more revolutionary way from the values of the scene and
all its attributes, also need to be brought in. 

thats what im saying. adults are in more of a position to give and
take from a "Scene" as opposed to just take take take like kids
(for the most part) do. 

>Who can blame the younger kids, though? Who at house parties or
field trips or band camp growing up spent more time making out in
the back seat of the bus instead of the real reason they were sent
there? That's to be expected of kids those ages. We can't blame
them for losing interest or growing out of it because that's to be
expected as people mature. 

i think its dangerous to just write off kids like they cant be
doing anything more meaningful than trend hopping. i believe in
holding high expectations for those people, but they always let me
down. 

>If the scene is to survive, it needs to position itself as the
"end goal" or some other sort of evolution of something that
people achieve as maturity sets in and as it can be adopted as a
sort of way of life, not the rite of passage itself. 

i dont think i subscribe to any sort of lifestyle or whatever as a
result of my taking part in the dance music scene. like any 23
year old i go out to bars, but instead of going to hunt for
females and listen to bad rock/pop, i like to relax with my
friends and listen to deep music. its not a foreign concept that
is going to challenge peoples' morality or social standards. 

>I don't doubt that raves can be a significant rite of passage for
young people, but I'm not sure it's the rite that should happen in
adolescence. 

there are plenty of psychadelic rituals that are common in
indigenous peoples throughout the world that are definitely
related to the idea of raves. i think there are just other factors
at work that dont allow teenagers to experience things the way
they should. advertising is aimed at children from the moment they
can first start to think a thought on their own. over protective
parents hide their children from the "bad" things, increasing
temptation to abuse those things. the list can go on and on. its
not necessarily the fact that it is young kids who cant handle the
idea of rave culture, but more like the kids in our society who
cant handle it at that age. 

>While I would agree that most club experiences are shitty and not
at all resembling a family-type atmosphere that most of us embrace

i guess that all depends on what clubs youre going to. this has to
do with my "quality over quantity" policy. 100 crap clubs arent
going to do as much good for dance music as 1 really great club will. 

>Ultimately introducing kids to all elements of the scene at a
young age will mean that they drop out when they're older. If we
bring them in when they're older, then we have a more stable flow
from generation to generation. 

thats what im talking about. the idea isnt to just get anybody and
his brother out to the club. the goal should be to get good
quality people with good ideas and an open mind and a serious
taste for music.

I didn't see any post about this, so I had to let everyone know. 
Bryan Gee is at Spy Bar tonight... located in the Warehouse District of
downtown Cleveland. I'm not quite sure how much it is to get in, but
probably about $5 or $10. Last time he was here was like 2 years ago,
and he was amazing!
Come out and support this show!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RAVE: R.I.P. 1990-2000

Actually, there's not a lot wrong with using shit like Kernkraft or
Sandstorm to "introduce" them to EDM, and non-vocal music.  When I used to
spin at teen clubs, I'd incorporate lots of booty house and old Chicago hard
house intowoven with the Miami bass that they liked (ahhh...  199quad).
Pretty soon I went from an empty floor when anything 4/4 came on, to people
requesting shit I know damn well they would never hear on the radio.

It's like the theory of the headliner.  Bring them in with something they
might recognize or something that is a bit watered down.  Then move them
into something else (dnb, techno, broken beat, IDM, whatever).  The kids who
can't get past the headliners, top 40, and pussy trance won't be there long
anyway, they'll move on once the drugs have worn off.  You don't lose much.
But the kids who get exposed to other shit, and are open to it, are what
this scene is always looking for.

How about local DJ's go out en force to one of the local radio stations
(possibly an urban station or an "alternative" station), and attempt to get
a radio show on 10 - 1 am during the week?  It can't be supported around
here in Dayton, but Columbus, Cleveland, or Pittsburgh might be able to pull
it off.

Everyone who I know who hates Pittsburgh is under 21.

80% of the kids who I know who are under 21 hate Pittsburgh.

I hated Pittsburgh before I became 21.

I  love Pittsburgh.

Not only is this city boring to anybody who isn't allowed to do fuckass 
until they are of legal drinking age (aside from rollerskating with 6th 
graders and pissing around in a mall with no -->arcade<--), but everyone 
over 21 is a dick to the n00bs.

There are no n00bs anymore! Just a bunch of bitter neive kids who are using 
asshole veterans as models.

They are bitter because they meet people like Tom Cox telling them what is 
good, what is bad, and why they don't belong.

(tom is just a broad example.  =p)

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RAVE: R.I.P. 1990-2000

I am sure pittsburgh can't be all that  bad.  I myself would be content with 
walking around the town absorbing the atmosphere and just thanking GOD for 
being in a big city.

Although lexington has the same sentiment with its youngins.  Unless you are 
21 the town isn't a whole heck of a lot of fun.  And when you are 21....the 
town still isn't a whole heck of a lot of fun. So either way, pffhfhhfbb.

Yeah our rave scene or scene or whatever died back in april.  We had events 
at the kentucky inn, near campus on the outskirts of downtown but of course 
even 18+ kids are pretty freaking dumb too and they destroyed what promoters 
here worked so hard to establish.

Its sad, but oh well.
Steve

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Tori and Bjork on TRIO...



I went to a robert rich show in louisville on july the 18th and he had this 
BIG thing with all these buttons, knobs, wires, and just stuff that he used 
to make music.  As well as a number of different keyboards, synths, 
machines, etc.  it was crazy.  I am not a gear whore but I do have a drool 
cup for such nice setups.

-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

SEAN CUSICK
(bedrock, balance, hallucination, saw)

Sean Cusick's definitive blend of psychedelic house and techno has firmly
established him as a globally recognized DJ and producer. His unique range
of intoxicating music has put him in demand behind the decks from Tokyo to
Prague. As a producer, you've seen his work under guises such as Second
Hand Satellites with DJ Three on Hallucination/Shaboom Records and
Freelance Icebreakers with Jimmy Van M. He recently collaborated with
Medway on "Neutrix" for Saw Recordings and is currently producing a
full-length album on the Viscous label out of Manchester. Recently, John
Digweed used Sean's "Of Course" for his MMII mix cd and subsequently
signed the track to his Bedrock label under the name Sean Q6. On top of
all this, Sean also pens a monthly column for xpander 
[ http://www.xpander.nl ], filling it with his unique brand of scathing
humor and "shoot from the hip" attitude.

Contamin8ted / Jackstar / Topaz / Chicago
Experience the hard, jackin beats of the turntable intoxicator. Some call 
him Mr. Bigfoot, others a windy city wizard of wax, but most will 
recognize this sorcerer of sound as DJ Bam Bam. Utilizing his musical 
aptness, Bam Bam has touched audiences worldwide. For the last nine years, 
he has been directly involved in and thus accredited for increasing 
awareness and popularity of hard Chicago techno/hard house music.

J O S H "T H E F U N K Y 1"
Funktion / Mix Connection / Kid Dynamite / Chicago
A DJ for over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, 
tech-house and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable 
tricks. 1997 saw Josh become a DMC Midwest Finalist. In 1999 he competed 
in the Winter Music Conference scratching competition where he was a 
runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In 2000 Josh took 1st place 
in the beat-mixing competition at the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off. 
Aside from competing, Joshs passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which 
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh 
has also helped co-produce legendary Bad Boy Bills "Bangin the Box Vol. 
4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

M I X I N' M A R C
B96 / SHR Group / Logic / Static Brothers / Chicago
Currently dividing his time between his hometown of Chicago and gigs in 
such places as Cancun and New York City, Mixin Marc is requested by his 
fans time and time again. Not just an experienced club resident, Marc 
pumps the crowd at raves all across the country. Guest spots with other 
heavyweights in the scene include Dave Ralph, Frankie Bones, DJ Skribble, 
Richard Humpty Vision, Charles Feelgood and B96 jock Bad Boy Bill. 
Recently headlining alongside DJ Irene and Armand Van Helden, Mixin' Marc 
has received praise not only for his abilities, but also for his demeanor. 
A professional to the core, music is his life... and his passion. Now 
working into 2001, expect only the best from Mixin' Marc... and that's 
exactly what you'll receive. Top of the line bangin' club hits, a blend of 
rich trance with a touch of domestic and European techno.

Originally from Madison, WI, Fade has been on the leading edge of the
Midwest breakbeat movement. Busy with two weekly internet broadcasts,
www.club246.com, and www.ravetrax.com, he is also one of the founding
fathers of Madison's premiere breaks night, "Magnetic" at the King Klub,
and the breaks buyer at Milwaukee's Trounce Records. Known for his
intense, bass-throbing breaks, Fade is quickly gaining recognition as one
of the Midwest's favorite breaks djs.

Inner Child House Collective:

Inner Child strives to showcase the highest caliber of talent to the
Pittsburgh area: artists new to the local scene, and artists which have
not been here for many years.  With the success of iPhunk in November of
2002, and the prior success of the groundbreaking event, Phunkadelik, in
April of 2000, Inner Child has been progressing through the local
Pittsburgh scene as a collective that is truly dedicated to the music,
which we all lovenot the politics.  Two solid weeklies at the infamous
dejAVu lounge, Mango and Agave, have proved to the local scene the
compatibility of multiple genres, while expressing all styles of House
music.  Mango has been a force to reckon with, entertaining at least 700
or more guests every Saturday, featuring the finest local and regional
talent while providing an upscale and plush atmosphere.  Agave, our newest
brainchild, combines the best underground House music with other
compatible dance genres.  Inner Child is now proud to offer Pittsburgh,
the surrounding areas, all who have supported us in the past, and all who
wish to support us now and in the future, an event of such simple ideas
yet such massive proportions. We hope to bring out the Inner Child in
all who attend! Prepare yourself for PHUNKTIFIED!

 

Happy Birthday Ova, Ian, and Jenn!

TEMPORAL RHYTHM PRESENTS, 

DUMONDE - JamX & DeLeon - Germany 
www.dumonde.de 

Germany's Dumonde joined the mounting embrace of
trance culture in the late 90s with a stormer of a
track. Created by Jurgen Mutschall (Chaos Records
handler and better known as DJ Jam X) and Dominik de
Leon (aka DeLeon) their debut single entitled
Tomorrow" hit Germany's Top Ten in 1999 and in no
time a staggering amount of record labels scrambled to
get their track on their compilations. Dumonde's
animated synths and refined sound continued to push
the envelope with their remixes for Push, Alice
Deejay, and Barthezz. Their rising DJ popularity was
assisted with follow-up singles including "See the
Light", "Never Look Back", "Memory" and this year,
"Human" & "Atmosphere". 

They have held the most prestigious residency in
Germany at the world-famous 'Dorian Gray", had gigs at
'Glow' in Washington DC, 'Velfarre' in Tokyo and have
headlined massive European dance events such as the
Love Parade, "Nature One", Trance Energy and
Godskitchen Global Gathering. 

Making their Canadian debut, this is one talented
producer / DJ duo that you do not want to miss!

 SUMMARY
 Doormouse and Baseck are back to their scheming ways,  and back
 on tour following last spring's Gangstabass Inc fiasco.  Doormouse
 promises a whole new live set...and his shit is getting  weirder and more
 "live" every time, mixing hardcore/breakcore,  jazz, deathmetal, booty,
 spoken word and strange humor.  Baseck has been rocking
 spots from LA to Milwaukee to all over europe pretty much on
 the constant.   Insane cuts and scratches with equally insane beats.
Strangely
 enough both of them have mix cds coming out on Tigerbeat 6 shortly,
 shorty.  Coming along this time is Stuntrock.  If you've ever
 had your heart ripped out, you need to check out his REGRET CD/ZINE,
its a brilliant "self help" concept album about getting over fucked
relationships.
 Stuntrock live is a whole nuther thing...that you really need to
 see understand.  And this time he's doing half PA, and half stand-up
 comedy.  Opening up are some younger acts - Hearts of Darknesses -
 who has made a bit of a name for himself with some crazy live antics,
 and has a forthcoming full length on Schematic records - playing off of
Pittsburgh's
 own Girltalk, who comes off somewhere between Kid606 and Cex.
 Also as a special guest we've got Drop the Lime from NYC coming in -
 he's really set to start blowing things up with a crazy style of
 mutant 2step, electro and breakcore, and an impending 12" on ambush.
 To round it out, Wrecked Soundsystem...made up of cutups and whatever
 other locals can muscle in some tunes dropping booty jams, electro, acid,
 rock, hiphop, noise, and weirdness.  So come out, shake your ass,
 get your circle pit on, or chill to some hot jams, tea and videogames
 at the Shadow Lounge.

Normally associated with his peers in Techno from Detroit, Europe and
elsewhere in the US and the world, John Tejada has embraced electronic
music as a personal frontier, expanding on his formidable resume as a
Techno recording artist as producer and remixer, DJ, and label owner. With
dozens of singles, remixes, some film and TV work and contributions to
sample CDs to his credit, this recent expansion has born a slew of tracks
deeply informed by his uncompromised aesthetic honed over years of
diligent production which finds its roots in Detroit Techno but references
a far broader range of music, both in and outside of electronic music. His
musically formative years were steeped in Classical music, growing up in
family of performing artists--his mother a soprano singer and his father a
conductor which then widened to include hip hop, DJing and finally,
electronic music.

Known for crafting a brand of subtle, musical techno, his recorded output
ranges across tempo and genre lines, from chilled out affairs with
spacious arrangements to pulsating, densely layered, deeply energetic
tracks that work magnificently in the hands of DJs as well as on the home
stereo.  Earlier on, his music found release on labels such as A13,
Multiplex and Generation R&S. Following on to those successes, he
established his own imprint, Palette, in Los Angeles, in 1996, and has
enjoyed seven years of steady growth and recognition. The label has served
as an exclusive outlet for his own prodigious output but has recently
begun to expand its roster.  He has also continued to record for other
labels such as Plug Research, Seventh City, Moods and Grooves, deFocus,
Sino and others, often in collaboration with 12 year long collaborator
Arian Leviste, and alongside these numerous singles, has also produced
eight albums; two for A13, Palette and one each for deFocus, Plug
Research, Moods and Grooves and Playhouse.  John's Cleveland shows are
always amazing events and we expect nothing less from him this time.

Warm Art is a global experiment dedicated to entertaining and educating
world dancefloors with the intelligent sides of techno, house, electro,
and experimental beats.  The Warm Art collective contains djs and
producers located throughout the world, including Atlanta, Chicago,
Cleveland, Los Angeles, Seattle, London, Norway, and Dubai.  Abbasso
Underground Lounge in Cleveland hosts Warm Art on the second saturday of
each month.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

I'm wrong for wanting to bring together everyone with different ideas and

A little better, at least you stepped up and said you would be the one to
"sock" me.  Meanwhile verbal arguments on the list should never turn into
physical confrontations.  It's just a debate, no matter if you win or lose
in your own eyes.  Just don't get your panties in a bunch about it.

if no one who really cares about it is willing to pick up those

If you think you would be interested, I implore you to email me =

impact you would have on these students will be profound!

Pol Pot killed 1.7 million Cambodians and died under house arrest and the

to be honest, even though i like those tracks you mention in that
cheeseball kinda way, im not sure those are actually going to get
kids involved in dance music in anything more than a shallow
manner. recent dance hits have been much better for sure, things
like that "breathe" and "days go by" and even that junior senior
joint. they seem to be less cheeseball and more easily accepted as
decent tracks. hearing "no ufo's" years ago in that ford
commercial was a good thing. even moby's decent success is not
that bad a thing because at one point that guy did make seriously
great anthems. none of this happened with any sort of detriment to
what we have going on now, but im sure they all did their part to
increase young peoples' awareness of dance music. and none of it
had to do with nauseating 14 year olds dressed like idiots rolling
on ecstacy.

my little sister goes out to a zillion punk shows a week.
honestly, like at least 3-4. she goes out way more than i do. and
she still "hates" pittsburgh. really its just a popular
misconception that other places are "so much better". really
theyre not. pittsburgh generally could use a little help in decent
night life, but to be honest theres not enough people into that
kind of thing to support more than we already have. but yeah to be
honest i just think young kids are whiney inexperienced punks. no
offense of course. by the time i was 21 id been to enough places
to know that every city in the US is essentially varying levels of
the same bullshit that is here. at least here since there's not so
many people the bullshit is moderately low.

hey man, ive been around long enough i should be able to do that.
i know when i was young and knew nothing, i talked to all the
older cats who had been around that i knew what they were into was
dope, and then i used their reccomendations. without people like
sine, trevor combee, etc i wouldnt have ever been able to learn
about good dance music. and lord knows those guys have been called
"assholes" enough times. they were always cool to me.

i know when i was young and knew nothing, i talked to all the
older cats who had been around that i knew what they were into was
dope, and then i used their reccomendations. without people like
sine, trevor combee, etc i wouldnt have ever been able to learn
about good dance music. and lord knows those guys have been called
"assholes" enough times. they were always cool to me.

my little sister goes out to a zillion punk shows a week.
honestly, like at least 3-4. she goes out way more than i do. and
she still "hates" pittsburgh. really its just a popular
misconception that other places are "so much better". really
theyre not. pittsburgh generally could use a little help in decent
night life, but to be honest theres not enough people into that
kind of thing to support more than we already have. but yeah to be
honest i just think young kids are whiney inexperienced punks. no
offense of course. by the time i was 21 id been to enough places
to know that every city in the US is essentially varying levels of
the same bullshit that is here. at least here since there's not so
many people the bullshit is moderately low.

when i was under 21 i went out to goth night, basement punk shows,
all ages ska shows, etc. theres plenty of stuff to do, if youre
complaining its because you havent looked hard enough. shit, look
at the things the warhol does on friday nights here. they pretty
much always have something decent going on, its all ages, and alot
of times its dance music related. i dont see many youngsters out
there. so they just must not care that much.

Well, I was merely using those examples because they are what Alex had used.

My main joints for the kids were "Stomp To My Beat", "Drop The Boom" by
Freestylers, and a couple DJ Deeon tracks.  Of course, back then, "Days Gone
By" wasn't even out yet.  "Rockafeller Skank" and "Bodyrock" also did
resonably well.

Titonton is also a rather hysterical person.  I met him at People's in
Garfield when he was here a few months back.  Kingston was in the midst of a
nasty stomach virus and Titonton managed to cheer me up just by talking.

YOU ARE HOUSE

-deep and funky house at red-16- 

127 E. 16th Ave. http://www.red-16.com

Saturday 8/23/03 10PM

Guests This Month:
Xavier Mathias AKA Steve Soulo- (Brique Rouge, Casa Del Sol, Addictive,
Go Down)-- If you have heard him play before, his sets speak for
themselves.  If not, then read the line up-- international production
skillz!  This cat keeps it deep but bumpin' all night!

Mike Salamon- I heard this one play at Frog, Bear and Wild Boar
downtown.  As I approached this joint, he was on, and I just thought,
"Damn, now that's what I'm talkin' about!!"  He also saved my skin,
because the previosly slated guest fell through.

They'll be playing with resident DJ Douglas Black (Penetrate, Proceed,
Headroom Digital)-- very talented, and keeps it funky no matter what
genre he's droppin'.

This month will be about as deep as they come, so don't miss out on the
soulful, nite-time grooves.  You can show up and chill in the back, or
hop on the floor and shake your booty.  Either way, the music will be
lush.

Yeah I was lucky to see Bjork she is amazing in concert. 
 
 
but off the subject have you ever seen The American Mullet show on Trio?

Huh?  I didn't know Josh Wink was originally from Cleveland...  first I
heard about that.  I thought he was always from Philly.  Rob Sherwood was
originally from Cleveland, who was the voice on "Are you there", though.
Lady Miss Kier is originally from this area.  People say Roger Sanchez was
originally from Lorain, but I have my doubts about that as well.

titonton best from columbus? i say thee nay(damn good producer, 
one of my favorites from ohio, with Mr Curtin, and Hanna.). i will 
say this guy is MOST IMPROVED from columbus/cleveland. (i remember 
waaaay back in '94 seeing this guy play jungle at the strip bar in 
the strip district..)


as far as Columbus goes.... ROB RAGE. undefeatable in my opinion.

pittsburgh...hard to say... so many:

Ed Umm. 
Kevin.
Trevor Combee.
Jose.
Supa C. (though in a knock down drag out match between supa and 
kevin... i'd have to go with supa.)

and, i hate to toot the Technoir Horn, but, CO2 is probably one of 
the best techno dj's in the city at this time. from selection, to 
technical ability, to knowlege of the craft.
..its time to to to get to to get to get fun fun fun funkay ay ay 
yeah! (insert funky rock guitar here..)

I don't know if it is fair to state "Best DJ".

How do you judge?  Usually he with the biggest marketing machine is the most
sucessful and maybe is not the best.  To be accurate you need to be genre
specific as well.  When dealing with an uneducated set of people, he who
plays the most anthems is usually your winner.

genre is irrelevant. 

skill, knowlege of music, ability to read crowd, technical 
ability, showmanship. all part of being a dj. 

something a dj said to me long ago when i was starting 
up...."shouldnt matter if you are a house or jungle dj, just be a 
good all around dj."


play it all baby!

>titonton best from columbus? i say thee nay

youve got to be crazy. titonton has played some of the best sets 
ive ever heard. he's rocked the co-op night in west london. he's 
gotta be one of the best world wide, really. 

>(damn good producer, 
>one of my favorites from ohio, with Mr Curtin, and Hanna.).

those cats are both from cleveland : P 

>as far as Columbus goes.... ROB RAGE. undefeatable in my opinion.

never heard rob but honestly, id pick titonton over anyone else 
without hearing them. ive heard him play a set that went from 
detroit and chicago classics to broken beat and 2-step to deep 
house and detroit techno. 

>pittsburgh...hard to say... so many:

>Ed Umm. 
>Kevin.
>Trevor Combee.
>Jose.
>Supa C. (though in a knock down drag out match between supa and 
>kevin... i'd have to go with supa.)

eh. scratch kevin from that list, add bubbles and now youre 
talking. though ive not heard jose so i cant comment on him. supa 
c in a skills competition would smoke probably anybody ever from 
this region (maybe not swamp but it would be a good fight i bet). 
but the thing that makes supa c great is that he plays good 
records too, its not just a skills competition. also, add selecta 
as well. 

>and, i hate to toot the Technoir Horn, but, CO2 is probably one 
of

really all you guys are the only people i go out to see other than

there you go again thomas...

ive been listening to titonton for several years now. (almost 10!) 
and i will say his oneness with the force has improved! but, after 
seeing rob rage do his thing, and HEARing rob rage do his thing, 
and playing alongside this guy, i have to say, rob is most likely 
the best thing to come out of Columbus hands down. some have said 
he is a young Mills. 

as for the set you've describe...arent they all pretty much the 
same thing? give me a dj who goes from techno, to old school funk, 
to disco, to jazz, to reggae to house, to minimalism to electro 
then i'd be happy. wait...doesnt ed umm do this(with class i might 
add)?

actually, just give me a dj who plays MUSIC and not SOUND and im 
happy.

titonton is himself though, theres definitely no confusing him 
with anyone else. thats whats up. and yeah i guess its been a good 
6 years or so since i first heard titonton and he's gotten much 
much better, but isnt that whats ssupposed to happen? most people 
get weaker, he gets iller. you cant say that about too many 
people.

hey man, i play whatever the fuck i feel like it. im only getting 
more and more into it as i gain confidence in playing at all 
tempos. but titonton is a definite influence for me in that 
reguard as is ed.

I'll go along with what you say, except for the 'no decent restaurants' 
comment. When I was riding those super fat checks of the initial dot com 
boom, I ate at the best Pittsburgh has to offer, several times a week. There 
is some seriously rocking cuisine available in this city.

Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Mallorca, Monterray Bay, Le Mont, Grand Concourse, 
Tin Angel, Palomino, Top of the Triangle(closed), Asiago, Jimmy Tsang's.....

The list goes on and on and on. Pittsburgh fucking ownz j00 when it comes to 
good eats.

my little sister goes out to a zillion punk shows a week.
honestly, like at least 3-4. she goes out way more than i do. and
she still "hates" pittsburgh. really its just a popular
misconception that other places are "so much better". really
theyre not. pittsburgh generally could use a little help in decent
night life, but to be honest theres not enough people into that
kind of thing to support more than we already have. but yeah to be
honest i just think young kids are whiney inexperienced punks. no
offense of course. by the time i was 21 id been to enough places
to know that every city in the US is essentially varying levels of
the same bullshit that is here. at least here since there's not so
many people the bullshit is moderately low.

 >Not only is this city boring to anybody who isn't allowed to do

when i was under 21 i went out to goth night, basement punk shows,
all ages ska shows, etc. theres plenty of stuff to do, if youre
complaining its because you havent looked hard enough. shit, look
at the things the warhol does on friday nights here. they pretty
much always have something decent going on, its all ages, and alot
of times its dance music related. i dont see many youngsters out
there. so they just must not care that much.

 >(tom is just a broad example.  =p)

hey man, ive been around long enough i should be able to do that.
i know when i was young and knew nothing, i talked to all the
older cats who had been around that i knew what they were into was
dope, and then i used their reccomendations. without people like
sine, trevor combee, etc i wouldnt have ever been able to learn
about good dance music. and lord knows those guys have been called
"assholes" enough times. they were always cool to me.

This brings to mind a question I've had for a while. Why don't more 
organizers post here asking for volunteers? I can count on one hand the 
number of times that I can remember this happening over the 2+ years I've 
been lurking on this list.

The main issues I can think of are:
You might want some way to filter out the people who are just interested 
in getting their name on a list or something.
It's nice to know the people helping out beforehand.

These issues might be addressed by holding open planning meetings before 
the event which prospective volunteers would come to.

Don't forget the Grand Concourse (as featured in Kevin Smith's "Dogma").

There are also a TON of small, out of the way places that are absolutely amazing on the food front.

We should team up and offer a "Food Tour of Pittsburgh"....

I'll go along with what you say, except for the 'no decent restaurants' 
comment. When I was riding those super fat checks of the initial dot com 
boom, I ate at the best Pittsburgh has to offer, several times a week. There 
is some seriously rocking cuisine available in this city.

Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Mallorca, Monterray Bay, Le Mont, Grand Concourse, 
Tin Angel, Palomino, Top of the Triangle(closed), Asiago, Jimmy Tsang's.....

The list goes on and on and on. Pittsburgh fucking ownz j00 when it comes to 
good eats.

my little sister goes out to a zillion punk shows a week.
honestly, like at least 3-4. she goes out way more than i do. and
she still "hates" pittsburgh. really its just a popular
misconception that other places are "so much better". really
theyre not. pittsburgh generally could use a little help in decent
night life, but to be honest theres not enough people into that
kind of thing to support more than we already have. but yeah to be
honest i just think young kids are whiney inexperienced punks. no
offense of course. by the time i was 21 id been to enough places
to know that every city in the US is essentially varying levels of
the same bullshit that is here. at least here since there's not so
many people the bullshit is moderately low.

 >Not only is this city boring to anybody who isn't allowed to do

when i was under 21 i went out to goth night, basement punk shows,
all ages ska shows, etc. theres plenty of stuff to do, if youre
complaining its because you havent looked hard enough. shit, look
at the things the warhol does on friday nights here. they pretty
much always have something decent going on, its all ages, and alot
of times its dance music related. i dont see many youngsters out
there. so they just must not care that much.

hey man, ive been around long enough i should be able to do that.
i know when i was young and knew nothing, i talked to all the
older cats who had been around that i knew what they were into was
dope, and then i used their reccomendations. without people like
sine, trevor combee, etc i wouldnt have ever been able to learn
about good dance music. and lord knows those guys have been called
"assholes" enough times. they were always cool to me.

my little sister goes out to a zillion punk shows a week.
honestly, like at least 3-4. she goes out way more than i do. and
she still "hates" pittsburgh. really its just a popular
misconception that other places are "so much better". really
theyre not. pittsburgh generally could use a little help in decent
night life, but to be honest theres not enough people into that
kind of thing to support more than we already have. but yeah to be
honest i just think young kids are whiney inexperienced punks. no
offense of course. by the time i was 21 id been to enough places
to know that every city in the US is essentially varying levels of
the same bullshit that is here. at least here since there's not so
many people the bullshit is moderately low.

when i was under 21 i went out to goth night, basement punk shows,
all ages ska shows, etc. theres plenty of stuff to do, if youre
complaining its because you havent looked hard enough. shit, look
at the things the warhol does on friday nights here. they pretty
much always have something decent going on, its all ages, and alot
of times its dance music related. i dont see many youngsters out

hey man, ive been around long enough i should be able to do that.
i know when i was young and knew nothing, i talked to all the
older cats who had been around that i knew what they were into was
dope, and then i used their reccomendations. without people like
sine, trevor combee, etc i wouldnt have ever been able to learn
about good dance music. and lord knows those guys have been called

I am with you on that. We could even throw up a little website that allows 
our guests to rate their experience, the cost and the quality of the local 
restaurants. I don't know if there is actually any interest in this sort of 
thing, but I've been doing web work for a while and would be willing to 
throw some time at it.

Don't forget the Grand Concourse (as featured in Kevin Smith's "Dogma").

There are also a TON of small, out of the way places that are absolutely 
amazing on the food front.

We should team up and offer a "Food Tour of Pittsburgh"....

I'll go along with what you say, except for the 'no decent restaurants'
comment. When I was riding those super fat checks of the initial dot com
boom, I ate at the best Pittsburgh has to offer, several times a week. There
is some seriously rocking cuisine available in this city.

Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Mallorca, Monterray Bay, Le Mont, Grand Concourse,
Tin Angel, Palomino, Top of the Triangle(closed), Asiago, Jimmy Tsang's.....

The list goes on and on and on. Pittsburgh fucking ownz j00 when it comes to
good eats.

my little sister goes out to a zillion punk shows a week.
honestly, like at least 3-4. she goes out way more than i do. and
she still "hates" pittsburgh. really its just a popular
misconception that other places are "so much better". really
theyre not. pittsburgh generally could use a little help in decent
night life, but to be honest theres not enough people into that
kind of thing to support more than we already have. but yeah to be
honest i just think young kids are whiney inexperienced punks. no
offense of course. by the time i was 21 id been to enough places
to know that every city in the US is essentially varying levels of
the same bullshit that is here. at least here since there's not so
many people the bullshit is moderately low.

Subject: {pb-cle} the great city debate

    you keep saying things like pittsburgh owns
    cleveland, or cleveland sucks.

    what is it about pittsburgh that is so much greater
    than cleveland? i've spent some time in the burgh, it
    reminds me of gotham city, all dreary and shit. there
    are some good things about pittsburgh.

    i moved to cleveland in july, and let me tell you why
    i am all about cleveland:
    - west side market!
    - good eats, lots of variety
    - buckeye and great lakes breweries
    - painted fire hydrants
    - edgewater park
    - abbasso [i haven't been to touch yet, shame on me]
    - asian food markets with miso paste and red bull!
    - art museum
    - the fucking library!
    - our new residence
    - friends that live near me :]
 
    what i don't like about cleveland:
    - buses can't drive for shit
    - neither can anyone else
    - homeless people that break into my car
    - people at clubs on the west side can be pretentious
    - nastiness of lake erie [although, it is a large body of water that 
reflects the sunset :]

no doubt, im not knocking the man's skill. i like titonton, it was 
the most fun i had at sauce!more dancing than fresca in your 
mouth! i'd say titonton is getting better..i'd also say that he's 
moving more towards what he wanted to do in the first place. i 
remember him saying he wanted to make drum and bass at first, and 
just found techno. i think this broken beat vibe is where he was 
supposed to be in the first place. when i listen to his older 
stuff...up to his newer stuff..its like a progression into that 
sound ya dig?

I guess your list makes me realize that its basically the same stuff that 
people enjoy in their home towns. I am not making a direct comparison to 
Cleveland here, because its irrelevant to me. I will say that I can identify 
every thing that you list as your "likes" here in the burgh too. I find it 
cool that we can get the same stuff. "Shitsburgh" and "Mistake on the Lake" 
are just funny to me, so I say them. You've got us on the weather though. We 
count the sunny days rather than the other way around!

     strip district, south side farmer's market

     absolutely, and representing every ethnic subculture

     Penn Brewery, Pgh Brewing company, Church Brew, Valhalla

     Insert lotsa nights here, but they might not compare with Abbasso 
totally

     There are 3 or more huge asian markets in the strip

     again, i agree

We've got that Paul Fleetwood character though. Toughest badger hunter this

Can I predictably say: I am over 21 and hate pittsburgh?  Actually i know 
quite a few people over 21 that have distaste for this city in one way or 
another.

Pittsburgh: Detroit with Universities, Youngstown with Sports teams

rick rubin kills it. quincy jones is the fucking man. steve albini 
has his moments. lee perry and king tubby were absolutely 
brilliant though tubby is dead. arthur baker did some ill shit in 
his day. 

thats my list off the top of my head. if you meant dance music, 
then probably 4 hero or theo parrish, IMO.

dude, pittsburgh doesn't own anything except a bunch of bad roads, traffic 
problems, predictably piss poor chain restaurants, empty skyscrapers, 
rusting, dilapidated bridges and a fuckload of debt (including millions on 
a stadium that no longer stands).  There are only two things keeping this 
city alive: The University of Pittsburgh (including UPMC) and the Sharp 
Edge (can you say: "over 20 Belgian beers on draft"?)

I'll give it one other thing: I was actually happy to come back here after 
being in detroit.

Jeff Mills.  I actually put up with detroit for this man.  (but i'll say 
that seeing any good producer on his home turf is impressive.  Paul van Dyk 
Live for 5 hours of hard banging techno, yes, i said hard banging techno, 
in Berlin was a once in a lifetime experience)

But, you should really make it more genre specific.  no junglist nor 
candykid would agree.

unless this is a lame troll.

Best Dj?

I'd have to say Colin Pierce.

Best Producer?

Shawn Rudiman.

Both of those guys really know how to hit it right in the sweet spot!

Ya know, I haven't even heard Benji spin in about 2 years.  He does rock,
but you can't say Titonton doesn't have range, either.  Shit, when Tom & I
went to his house before CDG2 (and my exit), I bought hard house off him.
Hard fucking house!  I've never really seen him spin the same genre twice
(dnb, techno, broken beat, house, even his live PA w/ orchestra @ Showing
The Love).

Subject: {pb-cle} new calibre EP


I just picked up the new Calibre EP on creative source.  This is the one
not to miss. Probably the most solid 4 track drum n bass EP I have picked
up in the last year.  God damn.

And these tunes have probably been sitting under Fabio's ass for the last
3 years.  This is not one to miss!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} roland dj 2000 mixer


They had one at Groove, I played on it a few times a few years ago.  It's
alright, it definitely "feels" different than most mixers in terms of the
crossfader and EQs but I think theres just a difference in the knob
tightness and fader give. I saw someone using the synth parts of it, ie
the filters and stuff, but I really don't think you need that nonsense.
Just save your money and pass on it. Unless it's like $50.

SCHWEET!!!  Klute is my hero!  He is one the biggest, brawliest men I think 
I have ever had the pleasure of having heard dj live in my recent memory.  I 
assume I can hit up chemical and check it out?

I know one place I won't ever order tunes from again, no matter how early I 
can get them---> the dogs on acid shop from the website.  Not even a 
freaking email about when I am going to get my plate in?  GEEZ!!!!

Regardless, the amount of good dnb these days is gonna make me poor in a 
hurry...

thats why i was asking. last i heard, "blame" was a dub being played. I saw
the lie cheat and steal vol2 release as promo a couple days ago, but i dont
know what tunes are on it. could be on there....   do scope it. =)

check out www.dubphorum.com  and go straight to dubplates. they have shit on
there that NEVER releases, and tunes that do, but shit is dope to listen to.
There's actually a Hive tune on that site called "last call" that needs to
be heard. Holy shit balls that tune is great. As far as ordering, try this
site... www.dubplates.org  They even give you previews of full ep's front to
back also soon to be released tunes. I love this site.

I think that loxy + ink ep is rather forgettable, but that's just me.  If
I'm not mistaken one of the tunes on there completely jacks part of ed

A father put his three year old daughter to bed, told her a story and =
listened to her prayers which she ended by saying "God bless Mommy, God =
bless daddy, God bless grandma and good-bye grandpa."

The father asked, "Why did you say good-bye grandpa?"

The little girl said, "I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing =
to do."

The next day grandpa died.

The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her =
prayers, which went like this:

"God bless Mommy, God Bless daddy and good-bye grandma."

The next day the grandmother died.

Oh my gosh, thought the father, this kid is in contact with the other
side.

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say =
"God bless Mommy and good-bye daddy."

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up =
at the crack of dawn to go to his office.

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch sent in and watched the =
clock.

He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay.

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the =
day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping =
at every sound.

Finally midnight arrived, he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said "I've never seen you work so late,
what's the matter?"

He said "I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of =
my life."

She said "You think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what =
happened to me.

This morning the milkman dropped dead on our porch."

beware - still can't find out anything about this tune. it's definately not on the album. (cd version or the 3 vinyl ep's)

roll over remix is good, but check out the signs remix he did, probably my favorite calibre tune yet.  full release should be out by the end of spetember.

The Calibre EP is very good, but I personally would take the loxy & ink ep.  That ep was one of the few "new" metalheadz releases that actually captures the trademark metalheadz sound.

BTW - Rhythm Killa by Rufige Kru (on the No Smoke Withouit Fire LP) is absolutely fuckin blazin'.  Best drums I've heard in quite a long while, and definately the best Metalheadz track since the re-launch.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best Producer, world wide?

calibre's good, i don;t know about the best though,

he's got some amazing ideas, but his his engineering & production leave some to be desired at times. Don't get me wrong i love his tunes to death, but there are an awful lot of muddy sounding drums on calibre tunes. A lot of his tunes lack the crispness of the top tear engineers like optical, dillinja, fresh, tech itch, kemal, matrix, m.i.s.t., & so on. But i guess in the end it's a balancing act, because you also have producers on the other end of the spectrum like dillinja, who is sonicly brilliant, but lacking on the artistic depth side of things. If i had to choose one producer, for my taste it would probably matrix. I've never heard a matrix track or remix that hasn't floored me.

the engineering on his recent drum and bass stuff hasnt really
impressed me, it just sounded very poopy. 

>Francois K as well, having done the mixes for Depeche Mode's Violator

eh. i have this thing he did with jah wobble in the 80s thats
fucking totally crazy. other than that, he did nice edits and rmxs
and thats where i think he stands out.

youre stupid. that freshness on wax rmx was dope dope dope. but
anyway, drum and bass producers arent even close to the kind of
skill that 4 hero or masters at work have. those guys are like
real producers along the lines of quincy jones and the like. carl
craig's work on the detroit experiment LP as well as the innerzone
orchestra puts him right up there as well. THOSE kind of cats are
the good producers. i guess if any drum and bassproducer could be
considered even in that league itd have to be roni size because of
the depth and variation in his live and programmed productions.

youve absolutely gotta be joking. i dont care if he's your
favorite producer, he's not even nearly on par with real
producers. he'd get laughed out of a studio. i love aril brikha's
records, im not going to call him the best producer in the world.

Subject: {pb-cle} track id - not best dj/producer related

hey all y'all junglists...

i heard someone here at work playing a jungle mix (prolly streaming it, dunno...) and one of the
tracks appears to have sampled delirium's "silence" (more than likely it was tiesto's
remix...sounded like his keys in the background...that vocal/pad build near the end).

and then it launched into the hardest, sickest fuckin' track i've heard in a long time.

i want this track...can anyone help id it??

thanks, y'all

Intresting... then why is that Progressive Sessions (not sure which one) such a cutting cd.  that atmospheric DnB with the vocals gives me a lift.  is it simply because the mic was too loud or a bad live performance.  or do you just hate them together period.  also , what did you think of that disk?

To quote you tom, "thats because you're stupid." :)  Look at all he has
done though, and his house stuff, etc. I'm not saying he's my favorite
producer, but in terms of skills in the production department, he's the
total package.  Have you heard any of his hip hop stuff?

No, you're stupid. that remix was horrible.  Masters at Work don't even do
their own engineering.  But I'd put them up there as well.  4 Hero, sure.
but I think photek is a better engineer.

he's got some amazing ideas, but his his engineering & production leave some to be desired at times. Don't get me wrong i love his tunes to death, but there are an awful lot of muddy sounding drums on calibre tunes. A lot of his tunes lack the crispness of the top tear engineers like optical, dillinja, fresh, tech itch, kemal, matrix, m.i.s.t., & so on. 
 
Yea, but I wouldn't compare Calibre to any of those guys at all. His whole perception is much wider than dillinja, fresh, and all those heads. Even Mathematics is coming from a whole other side of Drum and Bass. He may not have that "techy" crisp, but it all adds up to be SAUCE whenever he puts his tunes out. 
 
Majestic
But i guess in the end it's a balancing act, because you also have producers on the other end of the spectrum like dillinja, who is sonicly brilliant, but lacking on the artistic depth side of things. If i had to choose one producer, for my taste it would probably matrix. I've never heard a matrix track or remix that hasn't floored me.
 
I honestly think that everyone's on their own level of producing. I pretty much choose to look at each producer as their own, and feel what level they are trying to push into next. I can also say that there are producers out there that I dont feel, that aren't trying to push into anything new. You can definiatly feel a tune thats going to further the concept of drum and bass. Actually, that's for every genre in the electronic music scene. 
 
Calibre is always looking onto a different aspect. He's pushing a feel that probably hasn't been felt before. That's what I call a producer. =)
 
ps. i also mos def respect your views as well. we all look at things from different angles. =)

some of the newer stuff hasn;t been that great, but have you heard sidewinder? one of the best produced dnb tunes ever. This clip doesn't do it justice. The drums & sounds are soo deep & tight on this tune.

http://www.breakbeat.co.uk/player/?ID=5809


Also, I'm hearing his forthcoming metalheadz release is on point too. (Haven't found a clip yet though)

<<then why is that Progressive Sessions (not sure which one) such a cutting cd.>>

I think because on the CD's, Conrad knew when to lay off and just let the music go.

Too many MC's just keep going with the same trite crap, and feel they HAVE to fill the entire set
with their vocals.

The reason I liked Progression Sessions, and the reason I can't stand 99% of dnb MC's is because
there's a time to speak, and plenty of time NOT to speak, and most don't know the difference.

There are two remixes of silence floating around at the moment. one by greg packer that just got released on a white label & a second by j majik & the infrared kru.  The J Majik one is the tear-out version, currently on dub-plate and it's rumoured it will be released on breakbeat kaos.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best Producer, world wide?

I don't think oliver ho would get laughed out of the studio, but 
his recent material has been pretty boring. And coming from a 
techno fiend such as myself, that's saying a lot. His former 
flatmate's (max Duley) recent material  has been putting Oliver's 
recent work to shame. 

as for best producers, I would have to say Maurice Fulton. He has 
released 4 albums over the years, and each one is outstanding. 
>From his housier stuff on Transfusion, to abstract R&B type 
grooves as Ladyvipb (nuphonic), to his most recent Mu album on 
Tigersushi and eddie and the eggs on joss records,  his shit is 
just crazy. His records are the most trainspotted records I play 
at any one time. 

I opened my set in San Fran (8/9) with "choir girl" from his 
Tigersushi album, and the crowd lost their mind. good times good 
times! If you see any of his releases in your local shop, or on 
your favorite online record store, buy on sight! You'll will thank 
me later. If you don't, your taste in music sucks!;)

havent heard that. his work on "solaris" was fantastic, though im
not sure that by itself it allows him to be in the upper echelon.
you know i love photek man, so i dont see why youd think id just
talk shit on him. im not talking shit, im just saying he doesnt
belong in with the best. 

>No, you're stupid. that remix was horrible. 

youre crazy. that was some nice hiphop flavored drums with some
dubby bass. i actually kinda regret selling that tune.

Hero, sure.
>but I think photek is a better engineer.

this wasnt a "who is the best engineer in the world" question.
engineering i think photek is great as is rob playford and
optical. really if youre going to talk engineering skills, id say
that perhaps drum and bass producers rank up there. but in the
total production package, only roni size has exhibited skills in
pretty much all categories. goldie is a great producer as well, id
love to see what would come out of him working with a band......

hahahahaha. no way.

timbaland is my god. i dont know if id put him up with the
non-dance producers i listed in my first mail, but hes the person
that really makes me wanna make music. the neptunes seem to be
turning into one trick ponies. im kind of dissappointed. they need
to expand soon or their inclusion on a list like this will look
laughable. and for dre, i mean i love the guy's beats but all he
does is sample or replay other peoples' stuff. that doesnt make
one of the best producers in the world.

Maybe a more fair question is

i think most of the "dnb cats" understand. 
 
i hate when people categorize drum and bass away from everything else.

have you ever listened to masters at work or 4 hero? "producing"
isnt just making a drum loop. MAW and 4 hero work with vocalists,
live musicians and percussionists, programmed drums and synths,
etc. thats the total package. theyve had production credits on
non-dance albums.

its alright. in comparison to even the one dnb tune on solaris, it
pales in comparison. that tune has to be one of the best dnb tunes
(it made my top 25 since 97 list i made last year) simply because
it works on more than the drum and bass level. 

>Also, I'm hearing his forthcoming metalheadz release is on point

i always give metalheadz records a good chance.

i dont think so. they're concept of music was a different outlook then. If they dont understand it now, then they obviously left the process somewhere in time.
 
But we all get older. I just cant see myself leaving anything i do behind.

>producer = songwriter
>
>engineer = guy who runs the board/software

actually, thats not entirely true. the producer is the guy with
the vision for the overall sound/feeling of the record. the
songwriter is the guy who writes the song (which in the case of
drum and bass and electronic music is often the same as the
producer). the producer tells the engineer what sounds he wants
and the engineer is in charge of knowing his gear well enough to
get the sound thats in the producers' head. 

look at the detroit experiment. it was produced by carl craig who
wrote none of the songs. no idea who engineered it though.

im just saying, using only samples and replayed tunes limits the
scope of what you can do. if thats your only trick, i dont see how
you could be the best in the world. i mean i love me some dre
beats, but if i was a songwriter trying to get an album of my
material together, i wouldnt be calling dre. if i was a hiphop
emcee, sure. he's limited, thats all.

Well to me what makes a good producer (in electronic music) is more than
just being able to run a sampler, but rather to write hooks and melodies,
to arrange the music in a way where it grabs the listener, and to do all
the various musical aspects.

In addition to engineering, mixing and sound design etc, which ideally are
also the same person.

If all you do with the mainstay of your production is sample other peoples
work, then your production is like deejaying, playing other peoples
records.

Thanks for the info!  Big up your chest!  That calibre track is sick!  You 
can listen a full audio clip of it on the arena   
http://www.breakbeat.co.uk/listen/listen.asp?q=calibre&show=less..

I can't find that klute tune anywhere...grr...

I dont' know if any of you guys are big anime fans but there is a tune in 
there that samples one of yoko kanno's works from the macross plus 
soundtracks.  I was like *DROOL* thats a must have...its somewhere after the 
distorted minds tunes, <--which all SOUND the same, but who cares still good 
anyway.

Have you guys heard of makai?  He produced a tune called beneath the mask 
that has a sample from the ghost in the shell soundtrack.  I wish there were 
more tunes sampled from anime films, I could make a whole mix of that.  :-)

Steve

im not into the whole producing side of things, but still take time aside to learn about it when i can, but isnt producing about making your OWN sounds from the get go? I was talkin to a - sides awhile back, and he told me that he actually goes on slsk to look for samples. If i were to produce, id want everything to be original...
 
it just seems more logic that way. id most likely feel better about my work when it was done too.
 
dunno

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best Producer, world wide?

it is your own sound if you take somebody elses sound and twist it out for
your own sadistic purposes....asides is doing the exact same thing that im
doing...hes finding samples he likes...then completely fucking them up to
make a new sound...they made keyboards that used to do that....but now most
ppl just do it in software cuz its faster/easier

Subject: {pb-cle} Dogs on acid shop-depreciation

I don't know, I have ordered from them before and it has taken quite a 
while..
I ordered the calibre remix of nu tones our house and I still haven't gotten 
that in as well as a bunch of other tunes they re-stocked.  I am going to 
send them an email and find out what is going on.  This has been the only 
time I have got trouble from them.

But for the most part they do a tip top job.  Not as good as groovetech, or 
juno, but still good.  I've paid equal amounts in shipping from all those 
places and got my tunes in faster with juno.  You can't beat them at all.  
They dont' have too many promos but as far as getting your tunes in within 
about 2 or 3 days they are the DONS.

***1) Timbaland***

This is a great pick here... honestly there is way too many to pick just 1
or even 10.

I don't know if anyone mentioned Teebee yet his shit rules.

I also gotta throw in Matt Wallace as an awesome rock producer, he has taken
the sound of many talented bands to another level. When I went to see the
Stanley Cup I bumped into an old friend who recently worked with him in the
studio and had a lotta praise for him.

Check out the Invaderz studio mix on the arena. The Klute tune "Blame" is on that set, right before the Roll Over Me rmx.
 
I'm gonna keep searching for a stream though. =)

I have to say that those mix(s) are some of the best, most inspiring, uplifting music Ive come across in the Atmospheric DnB style.
I guess live doesn't do them justice.
Anyone else hear the two together and what did you think?
Can anyone give suggestions to similar sounding artist(s)/MCs?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best Producer, world wide?


I am going to have to agree with both Ratan-Cane and Tom here. 

a producer should be able to make GOOD MUSIC put together in a 
logical musical way. i say musical because a good majority of 
records i see people filling thier crates with is SOUND. boom 
chaga boom chaga boom chaga boom does not equate good production. 
it might sound nice, but it isnt music. its a tool! its part of 
the music. toss some melodies that make good music sense into the 
creation and you're almost there..besides, its wasting good vinyl 
real estate, make a locked groove damnit!!! (and no, having the 
record cut out the bass line doesnt do the trick either) someone 
once told me, you should be able to take an electronic musical 
piece, and play it with live instruments and still have musical 
integrity, otherwise, its a function of equipment, and not music. 
thats why i can say, Kraftwerk is good music. (senor coconut 
reinterpreted the tunes with a latin flair, and it never lost the 
musical integrity!)take Knights of the Jaguar, imagine it played 
with LIVE instruments. now take oliver ho's most recent LP...get 
the picture?  in electronics, i would have to say that Uwe Schmidt 
aka atom heart aka atom tm aka senor coconut aka fonosandwich 
aka.... is probably one of the best producers ive ever 
encountered. many of his pieces are experimental, many are dance 
floor, while others are sound tracky. but even in experiment, 
there is musical integrity. i'd also have to say that RECLOOSE is 
a great producer, as is HERBERT. im also starting to warm up to 
LEGOWELT's abilities...they are MUCH greater than i had previously 
beleived. he does his typical italio bits, then he has had some 
dirty brown den haag electro bits, and then...his soundtrack biz
(genius!)


just words(many) to think about...

i have my many favorites... too many to name here.. ask me next 
time you bump into me...along with the questions:how tall are you, 
how long you been growing your hair,are you going to hurt me, and 
do you play basketball.

the 90s.  people love to hate on him, but he's worked with soooo many
different people....peter christopherson, flood, clarlie clouser, dr.
dre, erykah badu, drew mcdowall, danny hyde, dave navarro, that one guy
from king crimson, etc.  he also produced or engineered songs and albums
for other bands like helmet and pantara.

there's my vote!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best Producer, world wide?

<<but isnt producing about making your OWN sounds from the get go?>>

well, not to nitpick here, but specifically speaking in the realm of electronic music, where the end
result ends up in a drum machine/sampler/sequencer anyway, is there really a major difference??

what's the difference if you record your own drum track and slice it up and plunk it into a drum
machine, or you take a sample of  a drum track, mangle it using eq/distortion/studio trickery, and
then plunk it into a drum machine?

i can program the fuck out of a beat, but stick me behind a real drum trap and i'm a tard. i think
if you start with better source material, the overall outcome is going to be subjectively better...

but, all in all, if everyone had the same view of how to create music, there wouldn't be a whole lot
to listen to, would there?

follow your dreams. you can reach your goals. i'm living proof. beefcake. BEEF CAKE!!!!

it's funny that i agree with tom so much. our opinions match well for them coming from totally
different directions.

what about names like:

Coldcut - Fuck a P. Diddy...THESE guys invented the remix with Eric B and Rakim's "Paid In Full".
(or, at the very least, legitimized it)

George Clinton - face it....without him, Dre and all those who followed him would still be working
in fast food joints.

James Brown - produced a wealth of his own material. can you imagine rap without "funky drummer"???

Massive Attack - while not necessarily varied in their approach, they consistently get the "mood" in
their music to come across.

Prince - produced ALL his own stuff...the variety in one of his albums shows more talent than most
producers/artist can hope for in a lifetime...

Butch Vig - i don't necessarily like all the stuff he produces, but he's done some amazing things
that you wouldn't normally associate all with the same producer...nirvana, smashing pumpkins,
garbage..

Derrick May/Kevin Saunderson - anybody remember who these guys are?

Nellee Hooper - Soul II Soul stuff is classic, and he's gone on to produce every genre in existence
since....

Subject: {pb-cle} some other producers i enjoy.

These are producers I enjoy, i always have a hard time picking out a top 10
or 20 or 5 or whatever.  I prefer just to state people that I respect.

The Roots - They kill shit by taking a bunch of jazz and tribal roots of
music and make some really dope shit, then toss in rahzel, and it's extra
flava on the ear candy.

Squarepusher aka Tom Jenkinson - I have always enjoyed all the minimal shit
this cat puts out.

Anyone who incorporates lisa shaw's voice, it just makes me grin and
thoroughly enjoy the track, her voice alone makes for some great picks
(read: music and wine, all i need, etc)..

RZA (who does all the engineering for the old wu shit) - revolutionized the
tone of street hip hop with triumph and reunited.

Harry Connick Jr. - all around talent.

Prince - See Harry Connick Jr.

Bono - Worldwide smashing production that hits different people on different
levels.

Chemical Brothers - These guys have such a wide range of sound they put out.
And it's all very clever in the meantime.

-Goose

PS I thought about adding on something about Perfecto hardcore, but i
figured no one would get it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} some other producers i enjoy.

hmm there's a ton, lemme get my bar none favs tho:

(tie) Brian Eno/Phillip Glass:
I really can't say which one gave me a bigger love of 
ambient/minimalist music, but they both brought me some
of the best inspiration for my music.

Jon Doe: 
You may know him, you may not. Hard as nails and sweet as silk, the guy's got a lot of diversity in his tracks, and continues to give me more reasons to like him.

Rick Ocasek (sic?):
Loved the work he has done with At the Drive In, added so much to soo many pieces by different artists, this is just the most recent example i can think of.

Aphex Twin/Squarepusher (tie):
What can I say, they both are geniuses of IDM minimalist jungle/downtempo/etc. They bring the IDM without being pretentious. 

I'll limit myself to those for the moment, heh.

Subject: {pb-cle} new mix online: soulcircuit city

Hey gang...come and grab some new shit! I'm pretty excited about this one...

It's a set of funky stuff...house, techno and broken beat...but there's an added attraction

The first half is other folks' music, featuring Titonton, Morgan Geist, Q-Burns, and more. The
second half is all original stuff that I've been working on for the last few months.

Download "Soulcircuit City":

Direct Link:
www.hypnotyza.com/files/hypnotyza_soulcircuit.mp3

For those who have weird browsers and need to do the "right-click/save-as" thing:
www.hypnotyza.com

and, as always, i encourage your comments, good or bad!

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} any reviews news on the WEMF what happened?

Lets try this again.

It was completely lame. The venue was like a garbage dump. No outdoor
music (except for a couple renegade stages). I didn't hear one set I
enjoyed. I will never go to another destiny/tribe event again.

I still managed to have fun with my friends but the music had nothing to
do with that.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best Producer, world wide?

Actually, I think that's part of the problem with radio music nowadays.
There's no great songwriters.  Good producers, occasional good artists, but
someone like Babyface who could write hundreds of songs for many aritists...
I miss that.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} producing


Heh
Well, it's all a matter of degrees.

You could say that Yo Yo Ma just plays music that other people wrote on an 
instrument that somebody else built, and thus he's less of an artist... But 
I personally don't think that's a valid argument.

Every artist is likely to create his/her work in a unique way.. if you find 
your art in creating your own sounds from scratch, that's awesome.  If you 
find your art in orchestrating samples of instruments or patches that other 
people have created, that's cool too.  The different approaches will yeild 
different results, but who's to say one is more artistic than the other?

That's just my thought...

It can't be supported

No way man...
 
As much as I think it SHOULD be... Pitts.  Cle... even Phila... no chance... anywhere but Chicago, NYC or LA isnt gonna happen.  Not enuf audience... becuz of population vs. interest.

They are bitter because they meet people like Tom Cox telling them what 
is 
good, what is bad, and why they don't belong.

 
Yes, thats very true.   and furthermore, as much as we'd hate to say it... there are 5000 Tom Cox's in Pitts.  and they all fuck everything up for new ppl.  Including (sometimes) me.
 
Cuz half tha time Tom Cox is right (gasp).
 
peace.

Everyone who I know who hates Pittsburgh is under 21.

80% of the kids who I know who are under 21 hate Pittsburgh.

I hated Pittsburgh before I became 21.

I love Pittsburgh.

Not only is this city boring to anybody who isn't allowed to do fuckass 
until they are of legal drinking age (aside from rollerskating with 6th 
graders and pissing around in a mall with no -->arcade<--), but everyone 
over 21 is a dick to the n00bs.

There are no n00bs anymore! Just a bunch of bitter neive kids who are using 
asshole veterans as models.

They are bitter because they meet people like Tom Cox telling them what is 
good, what is bad, and why they don't belong.

(tom is just a broad example. =p)

What a horrible night to have a curse.

my little sister goes out to a zillion punk shows a week.
honestly, like at least 3-4. she goes out way more than i do. and
she still "hates" pittsburgh. really its just a popular
misconception that other places are "so much better". really
theyre not. pittsburgh generally could use a little help in decent
night life, but to be honest theres not enough people into that
kind of thing to support more than we already have. but yeah to be
honest i just think young kids are whiney inexperienced punks. no
offense of course. by the time i was 21 id been to enough places
to know that every city in the US is essentially varying levels of
the same bullshit that is here. at least here since there's not so
many people the bullshit is moderately low.

when i was under 21 i went out to goth night, basement punk shows,
all ages ska shows, etc. theres plenty of stuff to do, if youre
complaining its because you havent looked hard enough. shit, look
at the things the warhol does on friday nights here. they pretty
much always have something decent going on, its all ages, and alot
of times its dance music related. i dont see many youngsters out
there. so they just must not care that much.

hey man, ive been around long enough i should be able to do that.
i know when i was young and knew nothing, i talked to all the
older cats who had been around that i knew what they were into was
dope, and then i used their reccomendations. without people like
sine, trevor combee, etc i wouldnt have ever been able to learn
about good dance music. and lord knows those guys have been called
"assholes" enough times. they were always cool to me.

Been to Columbus (Transformation 3) and it was lame.
 
Dayton was better.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} any reviews news on the WEMF what happened?

yes, the best music we heard there was an andy james cd that we popped 
into the VW.
blah
it was about what i expected.   lots of ravers, sketchy renegades not 
really playing much.  too many car stereos playing bad awful pussy trance.
they had the music in this  building with a capacity of i heard 500 
people.  too hot to go into for more than a minute or 2.
i went knowing it was sketchy so i didn't have high expectations, but to 
hear the stories of people who FLEW in from south dakota and stuff was 
really sad.

what is it about pittsburgh that is so much greater
than cleveland? i've spent some time in the burgh, it
reminds me of gotham city, all dreary and shit. there
are some good things about pittsburgh.

i moved to cleveland in july, and let me tell you why
i am all about cleveland:
- west side market!
- good eats, lots of variety
- buckeye and great lakes breweries
- painted fire hydrants
- edgewater park
- abbasso [i haven't been to touch yet, shame on me]
- asian food markets with miso paste and red bull!
- art museum
- the fucking library!
- our new residence
- friends that live near me :]

what i don't like about cleveland:
- buses can't drive for shit
- neither can anyone else
- homeless people that break into my car
- people at clubs on the west side can be pretentious
- nastiness of lake erie [although, it is a large body of water that 
reflects the sunset :]

my little sister goes out to a zillion punk shows a week.
honestly, like at least 3-4. she goes out way more than i do. and
she still "hates" pittsburgh. really its just a popular
misconception that other places are "so much better". really
theyre not. pittsburgh generally could use a little help in decent
night life, but to be honest theres not enough people into that
kind of thing to support more than we already have. but yeah to be
honest i just think young kids are whiney inexperienced punks. no
offense of course. by the time i was 21 id been to enough places
to know that every city in the US is essentially varying levels of
the same bullshit that is here. at least here since there's not so
many people the bullshit is moderately low.

when i was under 21 i went out to goth night, basement punk shows,
all ages ska shows, etc. theres plenty of stuff to do, if youre
complaining its because you havent looked hard enough. shit, look
at the things the warhol does on friday nights here. they pretty
much always have something decent going on, its all ages, and alot
of times its dance music related. i dont see many youngsters out
there. so they just must not care that much.

hey man, ive been around long enough i should be able to do that.
i know when i was young and knew nothing, i talked to all the
older cats who had been around that i knew what they were into was
dope, and then i used their reccomendations. without people like
sine, trevor combee, etc i wouldnt have ever been able to learn
about good dance music. and lord knows those guys have been called
"assholes" enough times. they were always cool to me.

hey trout. can you forward everything below this to the list? thanks.
 
hey pb-cle. i finally moved back to ny. kindof abruptly, but i'm here 
and i love it. i live in astoria - a clean and lively neighborhood ... 9 
blocks from astoria park on the east river, 2 blocks from the N and W 
trains, 5 stops from manhattan ... and best of all, i have a killer 
rooftop with an unbelievable view of the triboro bridge and the city 
skyline. the apartment is cheap and spacious, by any standards. there's 
plenty of room for visitors ...
 
yeah, i'm out of money (!) but i have several job prospects and at least 
one job offer. so if yinz know anyone in social services or 
nonprofits like mental health, education, etc., please hook me up. in 
the meantime, i busk with my guitar. those of yinz who remember me can 
hit me up when visiting or if you need a place to crash. i've got the 
little-fish syndrome so call me in the off-peak, as i rely on 
overcrowded libraries for internet access and i don't have time to email 
... miss and love you all ...david.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} the myers-briggs personality test

I'm an INFP.

I used to get ENFP, but lately I've gotten a bit agoraphobic...

Here's what it thinks of me-

"Healer Idealists are abstract in thought and speech, cooperative in 
striving for their ends, and informative and introverted in their 
interpersonal relations. Healer present a seemingly tranquil, and noticiably 
pleasant face to the world, and though to all appearances they might seem 
reserved, and even shy, on the inside they are anything but reserved, having 
a capacity for caring not always found in other types. They care 
deeply-indeed, passionately-about a few special persons or a favorite cause, 
and their fervent aim is to bring peace and integrity to their loved ones 
and the world. "

Ahhh, time to get back to bringing peace and integrity to the world.

theres nothing wrong with totally twisting samples up, especially
if you make new melodies and rhythms with them. my main knock
against people like dre is that he doesnt even do that. he just
jacks beats and melodies, which is fine because his tracks sound
good but he's not the best or even close.

>isnt producing about making your OWN sounds from the get go?

for me, im into writing songs. thats what im working on. i dont
just come up with a loop and then fiter it even, i make a couple
different progressions and ive really been working on trying to
write some synth leads. 

for other people, they can really get down just with other
peoples' shit. look at the dust brothers production on "paul's
boutique". brilliant. or the KLF's material, they stole large
parts of it. or rza on early wu tang records. or the kingpin of
sampling, dj shadow. those guys are really really good at stealing
other peoples' music. i love them, they inspire me to no end. but
they inspire me to make the music that one day hopefully some kid
will find in a used record shop and then sample to make something
else with. 

>I was talkin to a - sides awhile back, and he told me that he

yeah thats really just laziness IMO. even with popular drum
breaks, i nab them from my own vinyl copies just so i have a
different raw file to chop up. and of course i would never just
loop some drums. ever. its all about mapping the individual hits
over a midi controller and then playing drums yourself. im also
working on recording my own drum hits from my sister's drum set.
thats working out decently so far, giving me extremely raw drum
samples to fuck with as i please before i map out and play them
like a kit.

ha. imagine how many lock grooves a producer could fit on one slab
of vinyl. i have a record with 500 lock grooves on it. if one
producer made one record with 500 lock grooves on it, you could
buy 3 of them, play on 3 tables for like 8 hours and instantly
become the worlds most popular cracker techno deejay.

i always think about nirvana, because they made this super hyper
crazy rock music that kids loved to jump around to like fools, but
when stripped of all that the songs could be played by kurt cobain
on just a solo acoustic and they would sound brilliant. also this
classical pianist christopher o'riley recently put out a cover
album of solo classical piano covers of radiohead tracks. and even
without all their studio wizardry and crazy vocals, they sound
excellent.

recloose kills me. he works with live instruments, chopped and

track and it all fits together so seamlessly its like it was never
meant to be any other way.

im doing some stuff right now where i map my drums to a keyboard
and then i dont quantize what i play. you can get funky sounds
like that that its just impossible to get otherwise. by doing
things like that, you can create a groove all your own instead of
just stealing it. what are jungle producers going to do in the
future if they all just keep sampling the amen and the funky
drummer? granted their simplified versions arent cutting it for
me, but i think somewhere in htere theres room for more old school
photek styled drums. 

>i can program the fuck out of a beat, but stick me behind a real
drum trap and i'm a tard. 

you should teach yourself drums, at least the basics. you dont
need to read music to play funky drum beats, all you need is some
ideas. and you can really just figure out what drummers are
playing by listening closely. 

>i think
>if you start with better source material, the overall outcome is

if "better" means "sounds suspiciously like someone else's groove"
then i guess so. im more interested in people making new grooves.
like seiji's beat on "loose lips". that shit is INSTANTLY
recognizable, and he made that all by himself. 

>but, all in all, if everyone had the same view of how to create
music, there wouldn't be a whole lot

certainly not, and there is a place for sample based music. i just
think that its the easy way out of not creating your own stuff for
too many people.

him. argh.

are you sure? i think anyone who restricts themselves to only
playing other peoples tunes is more like a jukebox than an artist.
ability matters not to me, creativity is the key. this is why im
not really into music school, etc. training to be a studio
musician is something like training to be a plumber IMO. its a trade.

nothing. but to be the BEST i think youd have to have a handle on

if youre making jungle, theres this fantastic program that can
make changing up your drums so simple. its called recycle. get it.
you can chop and rearrange a drum loop so that every variation you
make is the same length so you can just stick all different
versions of the same break in your song. you can also substitute
different sounds in time with the rhythm of the break you chopped.
its not the mist highly original method of drum programming but
its better than just looping and filtering.

I think that the restrictions themselves can enhance creativity.  By 
choosing to devote himself to one instrument, he is able to use in ways that 
nobody else does.  The way I picture it is that a creative person that 
doesn't limit himself in any way is going to be able to create a huge 
variety of completely different things, probably none of which will be 
appreciated by the masses because they're all so far from the norm.  
Somebody who focuses all his creativity in one area will end up with such 
subtle creations that most of the masses won't even be able to understand 
what's going on.

This is why I think the middle ground works so well- people create within 
certain fairly rigid restrictions, but they also push a couple boundaries 
and do a few things to make their sound unique.  Obviously, this discussion 
is talking about creativity within an extremely rigid set of restrictions.. 
we're only talking about electronic music, and entire realms of musicality 
are lost when one goes from playing one's instruments to programming them.

I suppose it depends on what you mean by producing... But I would also wager 
that a person who really devotes himself to something specific will be able 
to acheive levels of subtle creativity that the more broadly based producers 
won't be able to tough... the price being that the masses won't necessarily 
be able to pick up on the subtlety..

But, that's the beauty of a debate that's based on arbitrary and 
inconsistent parameters.. Everybody has a different idea of what it takes to 
be "the best" at something, and there's never going to be any agreement.. so 
the discussion can go on forever and generate hundereds of e-mails 
cluttering my inbox.:)

thats not what was in question, whats in question is how many out
of town deejays come here that actually play good shit. often
times the house deejays that come into town arent the "real" house
music deejays.

but why dont you ask arnie why he was smiling and telling me how
last night was the best he's ever seen pittsburgh react to good
music? or ask ed the same thing? or ask
sweaty-danced-for-2-hours-straight jwan? or john esperjesi? or
yugi? or ian? or brother mike? they were all going at it like
there was no tomorrow, and like it not thats not what normally
happens when any of them play here. ive seen great reactions to
those cats at IG and at havana, but the vibe (i hate that word)
was so fucking thick last night it was insane. 

>its ashame it takes bringing someone from outside for people 
>to "have a blast"

why is that? i mean no disrespect to those cats who hold things
down here, but norm has more deejaying experience than probably
any 3 of them combined. really, that experience showed last night.
theres absolutely no substitution for that kind of experience and
depth of knowledge.  

>i listened to his stuff at the warhol, and heard him out in 
>detroit. it was decent enough.

the sets werent even comparable. he was decent at the warhol and
on fire at sauce. you should be feeling salty right now that you
didnt come out. chris c02 was even dancing and pumping his fist in
the air. you should have been there.

Here's what it thinks of me-

"Healer Idealists are abstract in thought and speech, cooperative in

interpersonal relations. Healer present a seemingly tranquil, and noticiably 
pleasant face to the world, and though to all appearances they might seem

a capacity for caring not always found in other types. They care 
deeply-indeed, passionately-about a few special persons or a favorite cause,

Ahhh, time to get back to bringing peace and integrity to the world.

im not salty at all, its just that i had to come in for some OT 
here at work. im sure the evening was on pointe. (and the venue 
helps that along tremendously...tight, hot and wet...kinda like 
Max Hardcore girl at the Warhol.) 

i just dont like the fact that it takes an outsider to make people 
realize things. bah! just a constant reminder of that which is 
pittsburgh...maybe i'll move to detroit, and change my name. then 
repackage everything, and re sell it to the 412...then i will make 
big money, and get many many women...yeah....

*goes into a catatonic dream like stupor,complete with drool 
coming from his mouth*

i said the guy was good. jeebus! im just jumpin on the comment you 
made about pittsburgh, and its House DJ inhabitance. of course, 
when i played in atlanta at house parties, the reaction was better 
than i thought...maybe because i was an outsider...why is that?

does anyone else have that kind of reaction...you know..when 
people realize you are an outsider? once, i'd like to see a local 
get just as much "vibe" or do people not react that way..because 
then it would be a commitment to thier relationship with that dj, 
whereas an outsider is a one night stand??


until 412 gets a bang bus of its own,

growing skills in organizing. But it must be said that any kind of strategic 
exercize tends to bring added strength to engineering as well as organizing 
skills.

As the organizing capabilities the Fieldmarshal increase so does their 
desire to let others know about whatever has come of their organizational 
efforts. So they tend to take up a directive role in their social exchanges. 
On the other hand they have less and less desire, if they ever had any, to 
inform others.

Hardly more than two percent of the total population, the Fieldmarshals are 
bound to lead others, and from an early age they can be observed taking 
command of groups. In some cases, Fieldmarshals simply find themselves in 
charge of groups, and are mystified as to how this happened. But the reason 
is that Fieldmarshals have a strong natural urge to give structure and 
direction wherever they are -- to harness people in the field and to direct 
them to achieve distant goals. They resemble Supervisors in their tendency 
to establish plans for a task, enterprise, or organization, but 
Fieldmarshals search more for policy and goals than for regulations and 
procedures.

Of the four aspects of strategic analysis and definition, it is marshalling

Fieldmarshals. As this kind of role is practiced some contingency organizing 
is necessary, so that the second suit of the Fieldmarshal's intellect is 
devising contingency plans. Structural and functional engineering, though

be not nearly as well developed and are soon outstripped by the rapidly

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} the myers-briggs personality test



intj - funny, this thing works



Of the four aspects of strategic analysis and definition it is the
contingency planning or entailment organizing role that reaches the highest
development in Masterminds. Entailing or contingency planning is not an
informative activity, rather it is a directive one in which the planner
tells others what to do and in what order to do it. As the organizing
capabilities the Masterminds increase so does their inclination to take
charge of whatever is going on.

It is in their abilities that Masterminds differ from the other Rationals,
while in most of their attitudes they are just like the others. However
there is one attitude that sets them apart from other Rationals: they tend
to be much more self-confident than the rest, having, for obscure reasons,
developed a very strong will. They are rather rare, comprising no more than,
say, one percent of the population. Being very judicious, decisions come
naturally to them; indeed, they can hardly rest until they have things
settled, decided, and set. They are the people who are able to formulate
coherent and comprehensive contingency plans, hence contingency organizers
or "entailers."

Masterminds will adopt ideas only if they are useful, which is to say if
they work efficiently toward accomplishing the Mastermind's well-defined
goals. Natural leaders, Masterminds are not at all eager to take command of
projects or groups, preferring to stay in the background until others
demonstrate their inability to lead. Once in charge, however, Masterminds
are the supreme pragmatists, seeing reality as a crucible for refining their
strategies for goal-directed action. In a sense, Masterminds approach
reality as they would a giant chess board, always seeking strategies that
have a high payoff, and always devising contingency plans in case of error
or adversity. To the Mastermind, organizational structure and operational
procedures are never arbitrary, never set in concrete, but are quite
malleable and can be changed, improved, streamlined. In their drive for
efficient action, Masterminds are the most open-minded of all the types. No
idea is too far-fetched to be entertained-if it is useful. Masterminds are
natural brainstormers, always open to new concepts and, in fact,
aggressively seeking them. They are also alert to the consequences of
applying new ideas or positions. Theories which cannot be made to work are
quickly discarded by the Masterminds. On the other hand, Masterminds can be
quite ruthless in implementing effective ideas, seldom counting personal
cost in terms of time and energy

I'm an INFP.

I used to get ENFP, but lately I've gotten a bit agoraphobic...

Here's what it thinks of me-

"Healer Idealists are abstract in thought and speech, cooperative in 
striving for their ends, and informative and introverted in their 
interpersonal relations. Healer present a seemingly tranquil, and
noticiably 
pleasant face to the world, and though to all appearances they might
seem 
reserved, and even shy, on the inside they are anything but reserved,
having 
a capacity for caring not always found in other types. They care 
deeply-indeed, passionately-about a few special persons or a favorite
cause, 
and their fervent aim is to bring peace and integrity to their loved
ones 
and the world. "

Ahhh, time to get back to bringing peace and integrity to the world.

they had it set up differently this time as well, the tables were
in the middle room so there wasnt such a clusterfuck at the
entrance to the bar. it really worked out for making the place
jump a little bit better that it could have before.

shit, remember dieselboy was still popular here even when he lived
here. but josh ryan who made a humongous trance anthem who spun at
cream in the uk didnt really have shit for gigs around here. its a
funny thing. 

>i said the guy was good. jeebus! im just jumpin on the comment you

like i said, i like a bunch of deejays around here who play house.
its just that getting someone from out of town who plays that
style is rare as hell here, thats what made me make that comment : P

yeah actually when me and ed umm played in baltimore last year
people went mad. hometown shit is always underappreciated except
in like NYC but their taste there is questionable anyway. 

>once, i'd like to see a local 
>get just as much "vibe" or do people not react that way..because

ive seen deejays kill it here, just not quite on that level. the
thing is, i dont know that ive ever seen so many dedicated deejays
at one show before. i think that helped the vibe last night
because everyone who is really into that kind of thing was going
there and expecting to hear some good shit. 

>until 412 gets a bang bus of its own,

2 porn references in one email. nice one.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} the myers-briggs personality test

Of the four aspects of strategic analysis and definition, it is the
structural engineering role -- architechtonics -- that reaches the highest
development in INTPs, and it is for this reason they are aptly called the
"architects." Their major interest is in figuring out structure, build,
configuration -- the spatiality of things.

As the engineering capabilities the Architects increase so does their desire
to let others know about whatever has come of their engineering efforts. So
they tend to take up an informative role in their social exchanges. On the
other hand they have less and less desire, if they ever had any, to direct
the activities of others. Only when forced to by circumstance do they allow
themselves to take charge of activities, and they exit the role as soon as
they can without injuring the enterprise.

The Architects' distant goal is always to rearrange the environment somehow,
to shape, to construct, to devise, whether it be buildings, institutions,
enterprises, or theories. They look upon the world -- natural and civil -- 
as little more than raw material to be reshaped according to their design,
as a formless stone for their hammer and chisel. Ayn Rand, master of the
Rational character, describes this characteristic in the architect Howard
Roark, her protagonist in The Fountainhead:

  He was looking at the granite. He did not laugh as his eyes stopped in
awareness of the earth around him. His face was like a law of nature-a thing
one could not question, alter or implore. It had high cheekbones over gaunt,
hollow cheeks; gray eyes, cold and steady; a contemptuous mouth, shut tight,
the mouth of an executioner or a saint. He looked at the granite. To be cut,
he thought, and made into walls. He looked at a tree. To be split and made
into rafters. He looked at a streak of rust on the stone and thought of iron
ore under the ground. To be melted and to emerge as girders against the sky.
These rocks, he thought, are here for me; waiting for the drill, the
dynamite and my voice; waiting to be split, ripped, pounded, reborn, waiting
for the shape my hands will give to them. [The Fountainhead, pp 15-16]
Many regard this attitude as arrogant, and Architects are likely, especially
in their later years, after finding out that most others are faking an
understanding of the laws of nature, to think of themselves as the prime
movers who must pit themselves against nature and society in an endless
struggle to define ends clearly and adopt whatever means that promise
success. If this is arrogance, then at least it is not vanity, and without
question it has driven the design engineers to take the lead in molding the
structure of civilization.

heres the catch with this though: music that doesnt resonate with
people isnt really great music. and by this i dont mean that
linkin park are great just because people like them. there are
obviously other factors that can lead to people liking music such
as advertising and so forth, but at its heart truly great music
transcends bullshit and makes people come together. what youre
describing is the "Rush" phenomenon where rush is so technically
"interesting" that their entire fanbase is made of musicians who
can "appreciate" their music. its like philosophy: even the
greatest most difficult to understand ideas are put out there to
help people, not to be consumed by academia. if its not resonating
with the people, the music or philosophy has failed. 

>Somebody who focuses all his creativity in one area will end up

this also isnt true if the person is making truly great music. i
dont think anyone will try to argue that there is someone better
at arranging sample collages than DJ Shadow. what that guy does is
so ridculously good sounding that if you tried to explain to
someone (who wasnt already familiar with him) how he did it, they
probably wouldnt believe that his compositions are just bits and
pieces of other peoples' stuff. it sounds so perfect that the
limitations he put on himself dont really matter to the people
listening. as opposed to rush, who just suck but get 10,000 wanna
be drummers at their shows to hear neal pert play a 20 minute solo.

thats not true at all. at this point in time most music is made
"electronically" because it allows flexibility that straight
analogue recording doesnt. so even those great studio musicians
get their drum lines looped to perfection. 

like i said before, when i discuss producers, i am in no way
limiting my discussion to electronic music because thats such a
small part of what producing is all about. producing is about a
vision, and knowing how to realise it.

look at someone like rick rubin. the guy has made some of the best
records ever, but never in one style. he did the sample collage of
the beasties' "license to ill" and also the suble summer rock
beauty of the red hot chili peppers "by the way". and a million
other things as well. and i dont think that his lack of dedication
to one idea has stopped him from being great.

Different music can be great in different ways.  Obviously Elvis and the 
Beatles managed to make a huge impact on the world of music that will never 
be fogotten, but it's not because they were the most talented musicians or 
because they pushed the most boundaries.  Then again, Steve Reich and John 
Cage made a huge impact on the world of music even though in the time they 
were really doing the most innovative stuff only a select few even knew of 
their existence.

If a musician does something truly innovative, it may not be appreciated in 
his own generation... but I don't think it means that what they're doing 
isn't great.

Well, I think you're agreeing with me here.  My point is that, while a 
layman may be able to listen to something and say "Hey, that sounds good" 
they won't necessarily be able to understand what was so special about the 
process that went into its creation.  The layman won't necessarily 
understand or care how the producer did something unique in mucking around 
with samples or hacking together synths.. as long as it's got a good beat 
and it's close enough to other music that they like, they're fine.


>thats not true at all. at this point in time most music is made
>"electronically" because it allows flexibility that straight

>get their drum lines looped to perfection.

Not sure exactly what you mean.  If a drummer is unwilling to accept 
anything other than mechanical precision, then that's placing a huge 
restriction on creativity... and of course, that restriction helps the 
artist to focus their creativity on other things.  My definition of 
electronic wasn't digital vs. analog, since those are both electronic, but 
electronic vs live instrument.

You gotta understand that I don't come from a background of popular music at 
all.  I grew up playing in orchestras and listening to chamber music.. And 
as advanced as synths and samples have gotten, they still can't touch an 
actual musician playing an actual instrument.

>like i said before, when i discuss producers, i am in no way
>limiting my discussion to electronic music because thats such a
>small part of what producing is all about. producing is about a
>vision, and knowing how to realise it.
>
Indeed, although I'm still a little unclear on your definition of producer.  
Does it have to be an individual, or can a collaborative group be 
considered?  Would metallica or Rush be considered?  What about the 
cleveland orchestra?

I don't know that artist (surprise surprise- I rarely know the names people 
drop) but I never meant to imply that those who don't stick to arbitrary 
genre boundaries are lesser artists.. I just wanted to say that those who do 
dedicate themselves to a particular thing deserve credit as well.

the beatles were a bad choice, what they did in music was pretty
groundbreaking.

sure but it was up to other people to eventually make their
concepts applicable to the general population. does that make them
useless? nah, not exactly. but i think any ground that is broken
is useless if it doesnt get the support of the people.

one of js bach's kids was wildly technical. his pieces are not
nearly as well known even to this day despite the great technical
innovation. and its mainly just because his music wasnt for the
people like his father's was.

minus the last half of the last sentence, we seem to be on the
same page. i think people are willing to go outside of their usual
musical preferences if they hear something that really grabs them.
the fact that theres not much popular underground music thats
actually good leads most people to avoid it. anyway, my point was
that if someone is good, their technical aspects wont matter to
anyone who matters. and thats what counts.

the human feel is something that even alot of electronic musicians
go for in their music. thats why people like the old breaks that
are sampled to death. no computer can make those kinds of funk. 

>My definition of 
>electronic wasn't digital vs. analog, since those are both
electronic, but 
>electronic vs live instrument.

well i was talking about recording live instruments. in the
production of live music now, lots of electronic means are
utilised. why have  a guitarist play the same riff for 20 measures
when you can grab the best take and loop it?

i would say that even some classical musicians would disagree.
almost all instruments are more limited in terms of expression
than synths are. with a good couple of synths, you can recreate
the different sounds of many instruments that exist and some that
dont. for example piano, as much as i love it, cant ever have
anything other than a hard attack. with a synth, changing that is
as simple as turning a knob while you play.

it depends on who produces the album. usually there are producers
and engineers out the wazoo when youre working with micing an
orchestra.

sure, but being the greatest in one field is pretty much never
going to be as far reaching as being pretty good in all fields.

dont think you have to worry about that. but if youve never heard
of rick rubin, you need to worry about something. seriously, if
youre going to discuss production check his work.

Agreed.  We're talking about world impact here, no point discussing those 
whose innovative work never really touched anybody...

Niccolo Paganini was technically so far beyond anybody else in his time that 
people feard he had made a deal with lucifer.. But his impact is still felt. 
  If you ever go to a concert where the violin soloist plays an encore, it's 
probably Paganini..

Technical proficiency doesn't guarantee fame and world impact, but it 
certainly doesn't rule it out.  Besides, CPE Bach (I assume he's the one 
you're talking about) is still a pretty famous guy among classical geeks, 
but it's hard to shake the label of being JS Bach's son...

I suppose I was being a bit jaded.  Having been a wedding reception DJ (ick) 
I got all to familiar with the mantra "People don't know what they want, 
they just want what they know."  Why else would 90% of wedding receptions 
open up the dance floor with "Celebration" by kool and the gang.

That song is almost at the point of making me vomit.


>the human feel is something that even alot of electronic musicians
>go for in their music. thats why people like the old breaks that
>are sampled to death. no computer can make those kinds of funk.
>
My point excatly.  And sampling somebody else's funky groove does constrain 
one's own creativity... but it frees up the mind to concentrate on other 
things.

>well i was talking about recording live instruments. in the
>production of live music now, lots of electronic means are
>utilised. why have  a guitarist play the same riff for 20 measures
>when you can grab the best take and loop it?
>
Indeed... many styles benefit greatly from being able to loop a guitar riff, 
but that's another constraint on creativity.  If the guitarist is actually 
playing all those phrases, he's got 19 extra opportunities to do something 
different and creative in his playing.  It's just become convention that 
phrases are repeated exactly....

>i would say that even some classical musicians would disagree.
>almost all instruments are more limited in terms of expression

Piano is the instrument that's gotten more attention than any other from 
synth designers, and it actually can have its sounds replicated rather 
easily with modern technology.. But still, while synths allow you to make 
huge alterations to their sound, they lack elements of subtlety.  I've never 
heard a synth that actually sounded like a violin, either....

Korg tried to replicate natural instruments with the Karma, and they managed 
to get some pretty good sounding harps and guitars, but there's still no 
substitute for the real thing.

>sure, but being the greatest in one field is pretty much never
>going to be as far reaching as being pretty good in all fields.
>
I suppose..
It's good to be a renaissance man..
but I wouldn't mind being known as the greatest _____ ever. :)

>dont think you have to worry about that. but if youve never heard
>of rick rubin, you need to worry about something. seriously, if

I'll look into it.  Perhaps the library will have some resources for me... 
got any particular albums I sohuld be looking for?

the  reason the  gird was  taken off of the  air is  because it is  highly

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} norm talley last night @ sauce

Suace was fun last night becuase Norm killed it. But i have to 
agree with the both of you, on some of the points you mentioned. 
The experience Normhas  was showcased last night, as he whipped 
the crowd into a frenzy. BUt he did that with records a lot of djs 
(and yes i'm patting my self on the back here) who know their shit 
rock out with. Some of the better moments throughout the night, 
where records i've played in pittsburgh many many times. Now i'm  
not Norm Talley nor or any of the djs curt mentioned. But that 
group he mentioned alwys hold it down whenever they play out. 

I just think its funny that it takes someone else to play an 
Andres record for example for people around here to realize that 
its good. They'll go out and try to find it now and realize that 
record is long out of print (sound familiar, tom?). But for those 
djs that curt mentioned have been playing that shit for years as 
well.

 What NOrm brought to the table was that"beatdown" sound that has 
been the latest buzz word in the deep house circles (well at least 
in detroit). which in my mind is nothing more than how they play 
records in detroit. I'm not going to go in to a deatiled 
description on what that sound is, lets just say if you heard him 
play at Ray's last night, that was it. His set last nigth reminded 
me of the sound signature after party i attend at the second demf 
a few years ago. A packed house, little to no light, and ppl just 
losing their mind to good music.

What was most excitng about Norm's set at Ray's, was that played 2 
hours of music that was strictly for the heads. And the heads ate 
it up, the other ppl in that bar saw that, and that in turn got 
everyone else excited. If you don't agree with me, who do you 
think was singing along to classic house records? Other house djs 
thats who.

why people in this city don't recognize the talent that's already 
around them we'll  never know. becuase that's that case in all 
scene's all over the world. Why can certain ppl play for packed 
houses in other cities, and then play for absolutely no one in 
thier own city is mind boggling at times. Since they're playing 
the exact same records/music most of the time. 

But once again NOrm killed it last night.

yeah thats the cat. going by initials is a horrible way to get me
to remember your name. reguardless, the fact that its mainly
classical geeks that know him was my point. his technical
precision couldnt measure up to the populism of his father's stuff.

wedding deejaying is a strange concept. the idea is to take a
hugely varying set of experiences and try to relate to them all at
once. the only way to do that is as superficially as possible.
lord knows that "celebration" is not the best song to dance to,
but its inoffensive enough that anyone can get into it. a friend
of mine is getting married next year. he doesnt want that stuff to
be played so hes getting a friend of ours to play who doesnt own
any of those typical records. thank god. 

>My point excatly.  And sampling somebody else's funky groove does

that it does, but really the goal as a producer should be an
overall aesthetic. even if you go very simple you can make things
very distinctive and very emotional.

obviously you can still add fills and lead parts over it if youd
like, or you could just make 19 different 1 bar samples or even
one take. conveniece can definitely be used to become lazy.

 I've never 
>heard a synth that actually sounded like a violin, either....

the thing is, it may not sound just like a violin, but a synth can
make a sound with the same envelope and character but with a
synthetic oscillator making the base note. FM synths use all kinds
of weird harmonics to add some more realistic sounds. but its not
about the sound itself, but the nature of the sound. you can
easily make a sound that has all the characteristics of a piano
and tweak it out to have the characteristics of a violin in just
seconds. 

>Korg tried to replicate natural instruments with the Karma, and
they managed

obviously if you want a guitar or a harp on your record, nothing
else is going to give you that exact sound. but if you want to
play something that has all the sonic characteristics of both of
those instruments, theres no other choice than a synth.

which would you prefer? for me theres no question: id rather be

he's done so much its ridiculous. check johnny cash's latest
albums. the beastie boys' "license to ill". red hot chili peppers
"bloodsugarsexmagic" and "by the way". really it goes on and on.
his production is wild and varied and always really really good.
go to allmusic.com and search for rick rubin and just download
nearly anything he produced. he did slayer, the cult, run dmc, etc
etc.

i guess that is probably true. but i would at least bet that theyd
heard of johann sebastian bach as opposed to the other cat whose
name i dont even know. most people are pretty lost on music that
old, including myself at least ot a decent degree.

dammmmmmmmnnnnnn. i know some cousin of mine deejays weddings on
the weekends sometimes to make extra cash and its like totally
ridiculous how much he pulls in for a wedding. i was almost
tempted to try it, but i know myself better than that. i think my
head would explode.

im just saying, when you have envelope generators on the
oscillator, the filter, and the amp, plus LFOs to modulate, you
can get something that comes in nice and slow with vibrato just
like an alien sounding violin. and of course it is usually played
by a human, or at least what a human recorded into a sequencer.......

there definitely is something about the house deejays from
detroit. that 3 chairs set in detroit this year was killer and
norms set was like a smaller version of it but right in the middle
of pittsburgh.

i know im willing to have fun no matter who is playing, but its

When are you going to realize that this test is
meaningless? Everyone knows it... its actually kinda
sad that you base so much of your social life on it.

well hey, if i saw them all in a shop tomorrow id buy every kdj
record ever pressed. but since theyre not there, im not really
into paying more than $20 for a record so im not going ebay
hunting. im generally irritated with limited pressings. but if you
wanna sell me your old KDJ and harmonie park records curt, ill
gladly take them off your hands for a reasonable price.

you wanna pay $50 for an old KDJ record and not have it on mp3 in
the meantime, good for you. im no sucker.

if i didnt spend any money on vinyl i could see a point, but
considering the fact that i buy quite a bit of new vinyl and
whatever backstock stuff i need thats still avaliable, i dont see
why it matters.

I made between $75 and $150 per gig depending on how long I played and how 
many extras the couple ordered.... but if they tipped me, it's usually be a 
10% tip, which would start at $40 and go up from there.

It just felt like I was getting screwed when thy were charging $350 and I 
was only getting $75 of it.  Plus all that income (including tips) got 
reported to the IRS so I had to pay massive self-employment tax on it.

It's going so well that I can make bitter sarcastic comments about it.

Yeah....

I'm gonna make this relatively short but wanted to make a few 
points:

-i had a blast... haven't had this much fun at a rave party for a 
while.

-good to see all the old school heads come out and hang in their 
old 'hood (metropol)

-big ups to inner child for putting a good line-up out there with 
both new and old acts to pittsburgh

-good turn out it seemed

-wish it wasn't $30 at the door....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} the myers-briggs personality test

Wow.  No one else is an ISTJ?   I've always come out as that (bout 
5 times now), and of course it fits.

**********************************************************


ISTJs are often called inspectors. They have a keen sense of right 
and wrong, especially in their area of interest and/or 
responsibility. They are noted for devotion to duty. Punctuality 
is a watchword of the ISTJ. The secretary, clerk, or business(wo)
man by whom others set their clocks is likely to be an ISTJ. 

As do other Introverted Thinkers, ISTJs often give the initial 
impression of being aloof and perhaps somewhat cold. Effusive 
expression of emotional warmth is not something that ISTJs do 
without considerable energy loss. 

ISTJs are most at home with "just the facts, Ma'am." They seem to 
perform at highest efficiency when employing a step-by-step 
approach. Once a new procedure has proven itself (i.e., has been 
shown "to work,") the ISTJ can be depended upon to carry it 
through, even at the expense of their own health.

ISTJs are easily frustrated by the inconsistencies of others, 
especially when the second parties don't keep their commitments. 
But they usually keep their feelings to themselves unless they are 
asked. And when asked, they don't mince words. Truth wins out over 
tact. The grim determination of the ISTJ vindicates itself in 
officiation of sports events, judiciary functions, or an other 
situation which requires making tough calls and sticking to them.

man I wish I woulda got a pic of that passed out dude :-)   anyway here is
my photographic contribution from last night ~ http://tinyurl.com/l2wd

Trouts face in the crowd shot is the classic 'cat that swallowed the canary'
look if I've ever seen it!!!

this takes you to all the photo albums ~
http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/dblaa2000/lst?&.dir=/&.src=ph&.view=l

I had a good time, it was esp. good to kick it with my best friend whom I
rarely see anymore and to get back to PB after so long. I was a bit
disappointed with the 'tightness' of some of what I heard last night. Ming &
FS were entertaining as usual but they've been better. Syrup was decent as
well as Sage but not great technically. I did like a good bit of what Sage
played tho. I thought Product 19 and E-Rock were really on comparatively. We
were surprised that D. Glaude's set was as hard and bangin' as it was, I
think we were hoping for something more funky and soulful. Still it was a
really good lineup and good times, thanks to Erica for letting us chill
afterwards and big ups Andre for the guest list hook-up.

~AA~

My pics from PB-CLE and beyond ~

Norm Talley rocked the Warhol.  (I hope Ed and the Warhol were happy with 
the turn out).
Sorry I missed Sauce ...

Cool that Norm stayed around and played the Warhol again on Saturday and 
then even stopped and played at Havana Sat. Night.  That was tight.

The past few months I've talked with various people on the list about
organizing a skydive.  Well here it is.  Monday (Labor Day) The AerOhio
Drop Zone is offering $60 off tandem jumps.  That makes the tandem jump
price $159.  This includes everything you need.  If you want pictures or
video that is extra.  For more information about tandem jumps and the
drop zone see: http://www.aerohio.com/tandem.htm
 
The DZ is about 10 minutes from where field day was.  I actually saw the
jump plane fly over the party Sunday morning.  
 
Stef and I are both licensed skydivers and we will be out there all day
Labor Day jumping.  Anyone is welcome to join us.  If you are interested
please email me at bjn@pookaville.net asap.  
 
B.J.

Subject: {pb-cle} my phunky pics

this party was a total fucking blast.  i saw some old heads that aren't 
around much.... todd, alderman, mr rab and mary lou.  some that are 
around, goose, celeste, dori, jes, who we couldn't pimp for 5$, not even 
3$!!!, ian, aaron who came with stomach cramps, ratana, and a bunch of 
others i forget.

the music was off the hook all night, too many sets to get into.
the afterhours, at first i was kinda ambivalent about going, but we went 
to see anyhow, since i haven't really been to one in years.  started off 
with some ragga dj which really was a good thing for the mood, then was 
the 412 dnb d00ds.  after that we took off for the oh so fun drive home.

anyhow, heres my pix
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/phunktified
one for the mullet watchers
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/phunktified/IMG_2657
and this one of aarons sums it all up

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} production

<<The way I picture it is that a creative person that doesn't limit himself in any way is going to
be able to create a huge
variety of completely different things, probably none of which will be appreciated by the masses
because they're all so far from the norm.>>

Reference Point: Prince...one of my top picks for "best producer ever in any genre in any time on
earth or any other planet".

Dude hasn't written or produced a hit in YEARS (the last thing to make a noticeable mainstream blip
was "the most beautiful girl in the world" in 95), but he's consistently put out an album almost
every year, and the music on them is TOP notch stuff.

While I take him to task for certain things (his neglect and then half-assed co-opting of rap, which
he did really poorly by using the weakest rhymes and horrible mc's, though he's recently worked with
Doug E. Fresh and Chuck D, which is a step in the right direction), his actual writing, performance,
and production are amazing...especially considering that he does a good portion of it by himself
(with a board op/engineer that leaves after the levels are set and the tape is rolling).

He plays any instrument you can throw at him. He incorporates every genre (although some to a
negative effect...) into his compositions.

There isn't a musical style he HASN'T tried. This includes classical (Kama Sutra, 1998), flirtations
with country (there's an Eagles kinda feel to "Dinner With Delores" from 1996) and folk rock ("The
Cross" from Sign O The Times, 1987), house (many remixes, including "Thieves in the Temple", 1990),
jazz ("Do U Lie" from Parade 1986, and basically all of his 2 most recent releases, "NEWS" and "The
Rainbow Children").


<<Obviously, this discussion is talking about creativity within an extremely rigid set of
restrictions.. we're only talking about electronic music, and entire realms of musicality are lost
when one goes from playing one's instruments to programming them.>>

Hmm...I didn't stop there. I guess that would've changed my answers a bit...

You got ripped.

I make $75 on a Saturday night (4 hrs.) playing in a bar on the South Side. The amp and speakers are
already there. I just plug in my shit and go.

Plus I get free drinks.

<<It just felt like I was getting screwed when thy were charging $350 and I was only getting $75 of
it.>>

If you took equipment, set it up, played, tore it down and left, you should've made $350.

Those 'entertainment agencies' are a fucking joke as far as DJ's are concerned. Lowest common
denominator bullshit.

In their defense, they did provide all the necessary gear, pretty much all 
the necessary music, and a steady stream of gigs.  I was guaranteed at least 
one or two if not 3 gigs every weekend, so if I worked my ass off I could 
get my $300.. And I didn't have to worry about fronting the $1000 or so on 
gear, or the huge amount of cash on music..

Of course, I did own most of my own equipment as well, but they weren't 
interested in paying me more for not using their gear..

And while I'm going off about it- there's one thing worse than DJing wedding 
receptions, and it's DJing middle school dances.  Ugh.  Especially at a 
fairly yuppie middle school.. the kids were bratty and so were the parents.  
It was even worse than having to DJ karaoke at corporate christmas parties.

<<In their defense, they did provide all the necessary gear, pretty much all the necessary music,

Somewhat defensible, but still...moving all that gear is 50% of what makes me charge what I do...

I'm a fat lazy bastard in my old age. What else can I say?

<<I was guaranteed at least one or two if not 3 gigs every weekend, so if I worked my ass off I
could get my $300..>>

With a modicum of self-promotion, a semi-decent looking phone book ad, and your personality (which
is pretty good from what I can remember), you could theoretically do $800-1000 for 3 gigs per week.

You have NO idea how bad the mobile DJ business is...I hate 99.9999% of all other DJ's...they just
absolutely suck. I'm constantly searching for people to work with whom I can rely on and hold an
intelligent conversation with.

<<And I didn't have to worry about fronting the $1000 or so on gear, or the huge amount of cash on
music..>>

True dat.

<<Of course, I did own most of my own equipment as well, but they weren't interested in paying me
more for not using their gear..>>

I don't understand that...that's just a dumb business move on their part.

<<And while I'm going off about it- there's one thing worse than DJing wedding receptions, and it's
DJing middle school dances.  Ugh.  Especially at a fairly yuppie middle school.. the kids were
bratty and so were the parents.>>

See, I dig those kind of things. The pay usually sucks, but a lot of times the payoff is in watching
the young'uns experiencing their first gender-mixed social gatherings and the fun that ensues. Plus,
you get a chance to get to em early and drop a house tune or a dnb tune on em while you're "warming
up" or "tearing down" and they occasionally ask about it...

This past school year, I dropped a couple minutes of a dnb remix of J. Lo's "I'm Real" in the middle
of the regular track, and a couple of the kids just bugged out to it...got all hyper and shit...mix
in a couple strobes...I may have just created a new raver...

<<It was even worse than having to DJ karaoke at corporate christmas parties.>>

There is NOTHING WORSE THAN KARAOKE.

my old friend marty would do mobile gigs and bar stuff, it was pretty 
cool because he'd let us use his sound for free for parties   :)
he made a shitload of money doing it, and the bar stuff was a bonus 
because chick would flash him for playing requests!

Here's a good little article about him being highly nominated for an MTV =
video award for a recent cover of a NIN tune ~

http://tinyurl.com/l4ja

I wonder if it's as good as that brief and disturbing video he did for =
the song 'Delia' a couple years ago.

This guy's life story is amazing, he has been thru things that would've =
sent the avg. person to thier grave many times over. No, I don't like =
country music but my respect for Mr. Cash supercedes said dislike... =
plus I think the stuff he's done the past few years is really deep and =
crosses over beyond country.

I was given this video done by a group called EBN.  My tape has been ruined, if any of you may know how to get a hold of more of their work, please let me know.   
 
For those of you who do not know who or what this is, search for one of their video's, it is a rather intense yet messed up creation of art.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} production

there are benefits to having the equipment...one of which being in the back of peoples' minds when
it comes to needing some sound for parties. i don't have anything on the level of Don, but for a
small room, I've got a bumpin little setup. i don't know that i'd be terribly willing to do it for
free for people i don't know, but like a circus performer, i'm flexible.

and the flashing thing? yeah, well, you know...it happens occasionally. i'm not terribly interested
in random titties. i wouldn't turn em down, mind you...but i'm not really scheming out ways to get a
shot of someone's dirty pillows either. i try to be at least somewhat professional about it when i'm
being paid.

and not that i'm passing any sort of judgement on your friend, traat, cause i don't know him...but
that's the sort of thing that most crap dj's do...instead of some decent mixing or figuring out that
song a sounds good when followed by song b, they're trolling the crowd for t'n'a. there's no
"performance" aspect into their performance, and they're essentially just a really expensive
jukebox.

my old friend marty would do mobile gigs and bar stuff, it was pretty
cool because he'd let us use his sound for free for parties   :)
he made a shitload of money doing it, and the bar stuff was a bonus
because chick would flash him for playing requests!

He's got an album out now with lots of remakes. I think its just called 
"Cash." I really like the cover of Personal Jesus. He's got another album 
out that has a few remakes. Its called "Unchained" and he does a nice cover 
of Soundgarden's - Rusty Cage.

Here's a good little article about him being highly nominated for an MTV 
video award for a recent cover of a NIN tune ~

http://tinyurl.com/l4ja

I wonder if it's as good as that brief and disturbing video he did for the 
song 'Delia' a couple years ago.

This guy's life story is amazing, he has been thru things that would've sent 
the avg. person to thier grave many times over. No, I don't like country 
music but my respect for Mr. Cash supercedes said dislike... plus I think 
the stuff he's done the past few years is really deep and crosses over 
beyond country.

the music was off the hook all night, too many sets to get into.
the afterhours, at first i was kinda ambivalent about going, but we went 
to see anyhow, since i haven't really been to one in years. started off 
with some ragga dj which really was a good thing for the mood, then was 
the 412 dnb d00ds. after that we took off for the oh so fun drive home.

TAKE NO PRISONERS: this Thursday, Aug. 28, the beginning of the Labor Day
weekend, ALIAS residents John Tab and ODJ, along with Deinfamous, crank up
the breakbeat pressure with the most serious hardcore jungle tunes of the
summer if not the past few years.

Top producers have bombarded us with tracks like =B3The A-Team Theme=B2 by High
Rollers, =B3Chinese Whispers=B2 from Spirit & Digital, =B3Sektor 5 E.P.=B2 which
includes brilliant music from D.Kay & DJ Lee, Baron, Total Science and a
massive reconstruction of Q Project=B9s =B3Champion Sound=B2 by Generation Dub.

Plus, =B3Fast Car/No Future=B2 -- Dillinja, =B3Outta Space=B2 -- M.I.S.T.,  the
anthemic =B3Shadowplay=B2 by Illskillz (D.Kay & Rawfull), and new tunes from
Mampi Swift, Dylan, arQer & Realtime, Concorde Dawn, Influx UK, Pendulum,
John B.=B9s remix of Omni Trio=B9s =8C93 classic =B3Thru the Vibe=B2, DJ Spice=B9s =B3The
Porn Tune=B2 and many, many more.

If you=B9ve been wondering what the fuss is about, why drum =8Cn=B9 bass has
suddenly hijacked the scene in the past year, then bear witness as these
records will reveal the ultimate plans for global domination.

Email me (alias_agent_johntab@mac.com) about reduced guest list admission
for you and every one of your friends....

After Thursday=B9s jungle revolution preparations, return fully loaded to
dance this Friday, Aug. 29 at Nation as Scion presents a 100% FREE EVENT w/
DJ SS, John Tab and Jen Lasher in the main room... (see details below)

The Breaks & Bones dance competition on Thursday, Aug. 28 will be postponed
due to a scheduling conflict.  If enough dancers would like to participate
this week, we could work something out =8B just email me at

I tried to be both.  I was there for the music, and pretty much played what
I wanted to hear.  Signing titties is just a great side bonus.  Besides,
rule #1 of playing at a club:  cater to the hot chicks.  You keep them
happy, and keep them coming in the door, guys will obviously follow.

I don't like country music but my respect for Mr. Cash supercedes
said dislike... plus I think the stuff he's done the past few
years is really deep and crosses over beyond country.

his version of u2's "one" and the beatles' "in my life" i consider
to be much much better than the originals. especially "in my
life", hte beatles arent believeable in their 20s, johnny cash in
his old age is very believeable even though he didnt write it.

Oh, totally! Seriously, you keep the hot chicks happy, you keep them singing, dancing and drinking.
This keeps men in the club/bar spending mad loot cause they're thinking they're going to take their
pee-pee out to play later. This keeps the club/bar owner/manager happy.

But the dudes that I'm referring to are (generally speaking) 5-10 years older than everyone else in
the bar/club, are completely out of touch with the music they're playing, and don't care to be there
other than pushing a couple buttons and collecting some cash under the table. And they oogle and
drool over the hot little piece of ass asking for Lil Kim's "How Many Licks" and then forget to play
it...because a penis has a horrible memory.

Hahahhaha!  I'm too much of a pervert to forget to play it, unless I'm
really drunk, she was ugly, I found something better, or I'm just not
feeling the song she wanted ("please please please play the booty call!")

Ah, mammar-- er, memories.  We used to have panty collections in the DJ

take a look at the wide variety of producers/performers using things like reason and ableton live to
create music, and then tell me again how they're limited in their scope and ability as
composition/creation tools for "music" as opposed to just "sound"....

someone using just live is as limited as someone using 1/4" reel 
to reel only. a great producer uses everything he can get his 
hands on to get whatever sound he's looking for.

<<someone using just live is as limited as someone using 1/4" reel to reel only. a great producer

right. i wasn't arguing that at all.

i'm saying that a TON of people...professional drummers, guitarists, producers, etc. are using these
tools in the interest of making more than just "techno" or "drum n bass" or "house". they're using
them to make music....in addition to their 'traditional' tools.

it says something, credibility wise, when i see an artist that i respect using a certain tool. not
in that, "oh, these shoes are going to make me dunk like jordan" sort of way, but in that "it seems
to be a quality product because a professional uses it and i like his work" type way.

my post was sort of intended for whoever it was that said that stuff made in acid is just a 'tool'
or was somehow inferior to other methods of music making.

my point is that the creativity and knowledge that goes into any given tool/program/instrument is
directly proportional to the quality of music that comes out of it.

Tom I wanted to ask you about something you mentioned in this thread a few
days back. You mentioned King Tubby in your list and I was wondering what
about him stands out to you... why you picked him over more obvious roots
reggae pioneers like the Wailers of the late 60's early 70's with Marley,
Tosh & Bunny Livingston or Ska legend Jimmy Cliff??? I also wanted to get a
short list of your (and anyone else who wants to chime in) best songwriters
and performers in regards to reggae - be it dub or dancehall, old or new.

Reggae/Ska...the Skatalites are my favorites by far
from the 'first wave'...and still touring.

I'm really not all that familiar with the  second wave
stuff.

As for third wave Ska, the following are great
performers/writers:  Skavoovie and the Epitones, The
Toasters, the Low-Fidelity All-Stars, the Attributes,
Ruder Than You, and Mephiskapheles (I head meph sucks
live but their first album is insane)

Anyone who digs reggae/ska and hasn't checked the
Skatalites is doing themself quite a disservice.

i was talking about producers. lee perry and king tubby are 2 of 
the early kings of production. lee perry produced marley + the 
wailers early material. lee perry also eventually built his own 
studio in his back yard called "black ark" where he recorded a 
good bit of the best reggae albums ever: 

"heart of the congoes" by the congos
" war inna babylon" by max romeo
"police and theives" by junior murvin

plus his studio band the Upsetters had so many classic rhythms 
laid down that it was sick. his skills are crazy.

king tubby is usually credited as the man who started dub music. 
he built homemade electronic devices to use in his tunes. he was 
wild as hell. 

>I also wanted to get a
>short list of your (and anyone else who wants to chime in) best 
songwriters
>and performers in regards to reggae - be it dub or dancehall, old 
or new.

ska: 
skatalites
really they did so much for jamaican music its silly. 

reggae:
junior murvin
the congos
agustus pablo
horace andy
dr alimantado

dub: 
king tubby
lee perry/the upsetters
mad professor
the scientist
sly + robbie
prince jammy
basic channel/Rhythm & Sound/burial mix/main street/maurizio

dancehall: 
shabba ranks
beenie man
sean paul
elephant man

theres so many great people though, its hard to name just a few. 
check Soul Jazz's massive reggae reissue comps. they always have 
great stuff on them by all sorts of artists from all the different 
eras of jamaican music.

meph were great. toasters were great. lets go bowling were great. 
the ny ska jazz ensemble are pretty fun. voodoo glow skulls were 
great. the scofflaws. i saw so many of those bands it was 
ridiculous. ska is why i got into dance music in the first place.

i have a tape of the 2Xcd on heartbeat in my car at all times. its 
a pretty good look at their best stuff.

Had a chance to see them in San Diego about 10 yrs. ago but didn't - big
mistake. I did get out to a couple of the 'Reggae Sunsplash' events out
there and got to see a lot of great musicians.

ONE STEP BEYOND!!! haven't thought of them in a while.

100% agreed. Good thread, I learned a thing or 2 plus I have some new/old
things to go listen too. Some of you guys out there REALLY know your stuff.

Let me represent this list and be first to chime in with mad props to:

Shaggy and Sean Paul.

Timless music shall live forever.

If you take me seriously I will kill you.

Ditto that...Think I'm going to have to dig through
the collection this eve...I've got one of their albums
somewhere, and I haven't listened to any two-tone shit
in a while...time to re-educate.

BTW, of the Skatalites albums 'Hi-Bop Ska' stands as
my favorite, although the double disk that Tom
referred to has a hell of a lot of great classic
material on it.

>Toasters, the Low-Fidelity All-Stars, the
>Attributes,

I'm suprised nobody called me on this one...I meant
the Stubborn All-Stars as opposed to the Lo-Fi All
Stars...brief idiot moment.

I think he has a great voice... most of the tracks on Dutty Rock are decent
but there are really only 2 standout songs to me - I really like 'I'm still
in love' because to me it has an authentic roots sound and structure and the
very next track 'International Affair' flat out rocks, has a totally
addictive hook. OK I'm going now, The Simpsons 'Medical Marijuana' episode
is on.

I've never really claimed to know shit about reggae or dancehall, but I have

i havent listened to the album yet, but of the singles im really
feeling "like glue" though all 3 have been good fun tracks. for
more of his older stuff, check out "deport dem", "infiltrate", and
"haffi get da gal yeah" with mr vegas. those are his biggest
anthems, but hes had many many good tracks over the years.

I think he has a new album coming out or something.  I still get emails from
his agency ever since my former agent brought him to Dayton last year.

But you can't hate on him:   Goose, Tom, & I did that already.

man, i was so sick that night... like ill sick, i only know i was

thing he did was the 'we like bass drums' crowd sample... then i 
puked on the side of 70 on the way home W00t!

darude is lame, save the 5 figures and book some sick midwestern 
lineup with titonton, norm talley, ratana, ed umm, some detroit 
techno cats and some house heads...  you could probably pull that 
party off for a 10-15 dollar pricetag and actually pay the dj's 
instead of them doing the service to the local scene as we often 
see being done nowadays.

shit, if you only knew... back when i first heard some of titonton's stuff,
i didnt get it.  i admit it... and then i finally 'heard' titonton, he's the
only dj/producer that has ever done that for me after first impression.  i
dont know what it was, but i just blew off what he was doing as something i
wasnt interested in... i was convinced to give it a second listen when
others continually talked about things... such as that selections for
intercourse EP or whatever it's called... then i listened.... i heard.  like
woody harrelson heard jimi.  ever since i've had nothing but pure respect
for him especially for how much he has put into the local scene, playing on
side stages for parties as favors just cause he loves the music.  I badly
want to bring him and the ill atmospherics out here for a show, i think that
would be a brutal combination that people would talk about for months or
years....

The red bull that you were drinking was the high octane kind. Which I didn=B9=
t
care for much at the time. It doesn=B9t have the fizz like regular red bull
does.=20

That was the first time I drank it that night too.

Oh yea, to the first pic of me holding that bottle of tequila... I still
have that bottle, and it's more than half full.  Blah.

I will diss him because of his music videos.

You got his good tracks on your hard disk?

I need to get back on Soulseek.

I would like to hear them...if he is good, please show me. Commercial

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce

havana and sauce fit what you're looking for... black mike at havana always
drops some mad flavor as a resident on the deep house tip and at sauce, it's
usually repped by ed umm, or some other local cat playing some deep soulful
music...  although some nights at sauce are flaky in the dj selection (more
politics than talent) as well as wavering from deep or soulful (ie
scratching over downtempo stuff, with mediocre track selection to not name
names), so havana has always been the best bet, because at minimum black
mike (dc space) will be playing for an hour and a half or so, but sauce is a
more intimate venue, so it's all up to your preference, so that is pretty
much what I have experienced.

in closing, havana is a good bet every week, sauce is peaks and valleys.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce

i went to havanna last week, and pretty much had a great time there. The
venue is super nice, including the people that attend the night. I'll
probably come out to both nights with my roomate just cause we're in that
deep house mood. We've been for the last week, but decided tonight to make
it a night.

someone needs to bring mister doug b. out...!

thanks for the info..

yeah theyre both good nights for sure. havana does deviate from
the house formula sometimes to a more prog type vibe, i usually
skip those nights. i actually havent been out on a thursday in a
while, between working and school and being broke finishing up
buying studio shit, i just havent had the money/time to go out.
but now that fall is coming ill be more likely to go out, the fall
is my favorite time to go to clubs.

Actually, I love some of the tracks I have on Kaleidescope w/ Huda Hudia.

On the other hand, Josh, the kid that threw the Darude event and was my
booking agent also had Polywog on the roster for a while.  He told me he
could get me booked along with her.  I told him to fuck off, that it was
hard enough to garner respect spinning hard house.  lol

They booked the wrong Junior.  Shoulda got Sanchez.

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Light", "Never Look Back", "Memory" and this year,
"Human" & "Atmosphere".

 SUMMARY
 Doormouse and Baseck are back to their scheming ways,  and back
 on tour following last spring's Gangstabass Inc fiasco.  Doormouse
 promises a whole new live set...and his shit is getting  weirder and more
 "live" every time, mixing hardcore/breakcore,  jazz, deathmetal, booty,
 spoken word and strange humor.  Baseck has been rocking
 spots from LA to Milwaukee to all over europe pretty much on
 the constant.   Insane cuts and scratches with equally insane beats.
Strangely
 enough both of them have mix cds coming out on Tigerbeat 6 shortly,
 shorty.  Coming along this time is Stuntrock.  If you've ever
 had your heart ripped out, you need to check out his REGRET CD/ZINE,
its a brilliant "self help" concept album about getting over fucked
relationships.
 Stuntrock live is a whole nuther thing...that you really need to
 see understand.  And this time he's doing half PA, and half stand-up
 comedy.  Opening up are some younger acts - Hearts of Darknesses -
 who has made a bit of a name for himself with some crazy live antics,
 and has a forthcoming full length on Schematic records - playing off of
Pittsburgh's
 own Girltalk, who comes off somewhere between Kid606 and Cex.
 Also as a special guest we've got Drop the Lime from NYC coming in -
 he's really set to start blowing things up with a crazy style of
 mutant 2step, electro and breakcore, and an impending 12" on ambush.
 To round it out, Wrecked Soundsystem...made up of cutups and whatever
 other locals can muscle in some tunes dropping booty jams, electro, acid,
 rock, hiphop, noise, and weirdness.  So come out, shake your ass,
 get your circle pit on, or chill to some hot jams, tea and videogames
 at the Shadow Lounge.

Normally associated with his peers in Techno from Detroit, Europe and
elsewhere in the US and the world, John Tejada has embraced electronic
music as a personal frontier, expanding on his formidable resume as a
Techno recording artist as producer and remixer, DJ, and label owner. With
dozens of singles, remixes, some film and TV work and contributions to
sample CDs to his credit, this recent expansion has born a slew of tracks
deeply informed by his uncompromised aesthetic honed over years of
diligent production which finds its roots in Detroit Techno but references
a far broader range of music, both in and outside of electronic music. His
musically formative years were steeped in Classical music, growing up in
family of performing artists--his mother a soprano singer and his father a
conductor which then widened to include hip hop, DJing and finally,
electronic music.

Known for crafting a brand of subtle, musical techno, his recorded output
ranges across tempo and genre lines, from chilled out affairs with
spacious arrangements to pulsating, densely layered, deeply energetic
tracks that work magnificently in the hands of DJs as well as on the home
stereo.  Earlier on, his music found release on labels such as A13,
Multiplex and Generation R&S. Following on to those successes, he
established his own imprint, Palette, in Los Angeles, in 1996, and has
enjoyed seven years of steady growth and recognition. The label has served
as an exclusive outlet for his own prodigious output but has recently
begun to expand its roster.  He has also continued to record for other
labels such as Plug Research, Seventh City, Moods and Grooves, deFocus,
Sino and others, often in collaboration with 12 year long collaborator
Arian Leviste, and alongside these numerous singles, has also produced
eight albums; two for A13, Palette and one each for deFocus, Plug
Research, Moods and Grooves and Playhouse.  John's Cleveland shows are
always amazing events and we expect nothing less from him this time.

Warm Art is a global experiment dedicated to entertaining and educating
world dancefloors with the intelligent sides of techno, house, electro,
and experimental beats.  The Warm Art collective contains djs and
producers located throughout the world, including Atlanta, Chicago,
Cleveland, Los Angeles, Seattle, London, Norway, and Dubai.  Abbasso
Underground Lounge in Cleveland hosts Warm Art on the second saturday of
each month.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

THE ENTERTAINMENT DOME:

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

Hopefully this night will be half as succesful as the origanl epiphany nights.  Shaky (R.I.P.) broguht in soo much talent back then (Dsl, Tech Itch, Digital, 1.8.7, Pish-Posh, Dara, Ak1200, Future Cut, Usual Suspects, Kaos, Hive, E-sassin, Sage), as well as giving residencies to many of the then up-coming dnb dj's & producers in our area (Pollen, Alaska, Bagel, Andy Sine, Kaos, Dez Drastik, Rob Riddim, Ground Zero, Focus, Tik-Tak, KC & Myself).

Hope to see everyone there.

Zythos every Monday night.

Support.

Pittsburgh, SARAH - it will be her last Thursday tending bar at Club Havana.

regards,

Jason C.

politician - one who seeks personal or partisan gain, often by scheming and
maneuvering

your pocket protecting ass

something - YOU

you dork !  youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu dork !  now why not name names, you greasy
politician.
i can't believe you just called me a politician and in the same post said
"to not name names".
what on earth do you have to lose ?  honey, call me a million things.  don't
call me a politician.
i'm so calling you out.  here's my offer.  i'll pay you $50 to come to sauce
and play in front of
kevin, ed, michael robertson, cristina and i one friday night from 9-11.
food and drinks on us.
we can even call it "cook da goose" if you'd like.  you in ?

i have nothing but respect for what ed does.  i never have stated 
otherwise.  he's got great track selection and a plethora of 
diversity as well as great mixing skills.  I know what to expect 
there.  ed is an asset to this city's scene.

kevin has great technical ability. i have never questioned that, 
but with the scope of what you promote your night as vs what 
question was posed about deep house, is scratching _to excess_ 
over downtempo really needed?  he rocks shit in the genres that he 
plays, just i have always pictured sauce as promoted to a 
different audience?

>
>you dork !  youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu dork !  now why not name names,

anyone who has been to sauce caught the 'not to name names' 
reference to kevin, it was meant as sarcasm, not as some sort of 
way to weasel out.

> honey, call me a million things.  don't
>call me a politician.

the politics reference is for how you have avoided some of the 
city talent due to some personal issues you may have with them.

of course, i'm always up for a challenge.  you can keep the cook 
da goose name off of it, and stop knocking on it, you've never 
been there to know what you're missing.  

>yes, flav-o-mike is da man.  he's so hot that 5 people support 
his tuesday night.  i'm sure
>you're one of them.  you sound like a fan.

actually tuesday nights i support jim selecta's gig at kellys 
where ed umm often plays.  i am there _every_ tuesday, a big fan.  
i see mike at havana where i then support him 3 thursdays a month, 
as you've probably noticed i support your event very frequently (i 
think 7 out of 9 since i moved here, only missing when i was out 
of town), even on nights when it's been quite dead, but as i 
mentioned peaks and valleys.  dont question my support for the 
local scene, i am out there making sure i give props to those 
deserving, and criticism where i see fit.

Subject: {pb-cle} nrr: blue angels in cleveland

    our new apartment kicks ass. how many places
    can you sit at your computer and watch the blue
    angels flying randomly over the cleveland sky?

    they are mainly circling the burke airport area
    and keeping towards the lake, but every once in
    a while i'll hear "wheeaaaaarrrrhhh" [or
    something like that] as they fly by my window.

    it's going to be a fun weekend viewing the cleveland
    skyline!

    what else is going on in cleveland this weekend?
    [preferably cheap and fun, since i'm still broke]

Here's my gameplan for the weekend:

Friday - working @ Moda i think

Saturday - Abbasso for a bit and if I can find someone to tag along I really
want to go see Ian @ Spy.

Sunday - playing from 4-9 on the sidewalk @ twist (maybe I'll stop by the
market to get mint leaves for Mojitos!), then going to go check out Jeff
Pons, plus you get Y2kid AND Behrouz.

Monday - ??????

kevin can collect all the insanely weak records he wants. its
still not going to make his sets anything other than sleep fodder
for me.

no offense, but theres certainly been some partisanship going on
in the bookings at sauce recently, and im not going to name any
names cause its not really my business. but its still some weak shit.

tuesday night is a bad night, me and goose are at funk and soul
night every tuesday. i dont know what else to say about that.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce


jeebus. what does this argument acomplish? fighting over the vast 
wasteland that is pittsburgh... 


secondly, is sauce really a "deep house" nite? from what ive been 
told, and what ive experienced there, it seems to be rather 
diverse. (it better be, im planing on playing 
electro/italio/nuwave/post punk/80's r&B/dance/your moms that wont 
stop callin' me)

will people hate me for being non "deep" and non "uppity" about 
it? hope not. will we realize that just about every nite in 
pittsburgh claims to be "deep" and "soulful"? will we realize 
there is room for other kinds of funk? prolly not...this is 
pittsburgh damnit.  "you can't play that record with that 
one...take the safe approach!" you are not allowed to scratch! 
unless playing hip hop or drum and bass! stop! why cant people 
just enjoy shit for what it is? there is more than one way to have 
fun! but thats just me, i like to see different shit every time i 
leave the house...i get bored really easily.


i like the evenings i spent at sauce...except that one evening 
where that old woman kept harrassing me. i also have enjoyed my 
evenings at havana. (the few that im able to make...) all in all, 
at least SOMEONE is out there having a place where shit can 
happen...if by chance i meet a nice rich young lady that will 
allow me not to work, and she pays me a nominal fee, i could make 
it out to more of these great events.

    our new apartment kicks ass. how many places
    can you sit at your computer and watch the blue
    angels flying randomly over the cleveland sky?

    they are mainly circling the burke airport area
    and keeping towards the lake, but every once in
    a while i'll hear "wheeaaaaarrrrhhh" [or
    something like that] as they fly by my window.

    it's going to be a fun weekend viewing the cleveland
    skyline!

    what else is going on in cleveland this weekend?
    [preferably cheap and fun, since i'm still broke]

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce

not to butt in - but i can never keep my mouth shut - you all should 
know by now.

regardless of whatever "politics" you think come in to play - it's 
kelly and cristina's night. so they are free to book whomever they 
want, whenever they want. and i was unaware it was being promoted as 
the "premiere" deep house night in pittsburgh - as far as i have been 
aware, it was always just something chill to do on fridays.

i know i must be quoted in the archives 100 times saying this - but if 
you think you can do a better night - feel free to go ahead and prove 
yourself. otherwise - you have no room to talk. and if you are 
expressing an opinion here, feel free - but instead of acting like you 
are speaking for the masses, maybe next time you should say "in my 
opinion, i like havana better".

i just think it is so funny that when people don't get booked 
somewhere, it is automatically politics. maybe kelly doesn't like you 
music. maybe she just doesn't like you. either way - it's her night, 
and if she wants to book someone, that's her business to do so or not.

not trying to be rude or anything ed - but i thought your post was kind 
of coming from nowhere - being that you just moved here a few months 
ago... and i am a stickler for people expressing their opinions and 
stating them as such - not as the opinions of the whole.

loud mouthed as always - xoxo,
dori

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce

    now i'm coming from left field. i don't live
    in pittsburgh and haven't been to either of
    the nights in questions.

    however, generally when i read an email
    from someone, i view it as their opinion, not
    that they are stating facts for the masses.

    we live in a free country where people are
    given the right to say what the fuck ever they
    want. it's not really about whether they have
    room to talk or not, but that they have a right
    to state their opinion.
   
    i didn't think ed was really dissing sauce that
    hard. if he goes out and supports the night,
    he obviously likes it. he was replying to jes
    asking about a deep house night. maybe he
    doesn't think major scratching fits into the
    deep house genre. maybe i missed the whole
    point, i dunno..

    i've personaly yet to hear a set of kevin's
    that i like. does that make him a bad dj? no.
    does that mean i have bad taste in music?
    maybe. but wtf-ever. i'll continue to express
    my opinion, regardless of who agrees with
    it as long as i have the right to.

    there are a lot of things i don't like about the
    country we live in right now, but the right to
    express oneself is one i'm not looking to give
    up any time soon.

our new apartment kicks ass. how many places
can you sit at your computer and watch the blue
angels flying randomly over the cleveland sky?

they are mainly circling the burke airport area
and keeping towards the lake, but every once in
a while i'll hear "wheeaaaaarrrrhhh" [or
something like that] as they fly by my window.

it's going to be a fun weekend viewing the cleveland
skyline!

what else is going on in cleveland this weekend?
[preferably cheap and fun, since i'm still broke]

I'm pretty sure they always do it Labor Day Weekend. So yay, no work on 
Monday for some of us.

I love watching the crazy stunt flyers in the bi-wing prop planes, and of 
course the jets in formation.

i'm not saying he can't express his opinion - like i said, i am just a 
stickler for people stating their opinion as such.

i didn't take it as harsh as kelly did, but i did think it sounded like 
he was dissing the night when i read the original post. to me, jes was 
asking for a deep house night. if he thought havana was the place to 
be, then why not say "go to havana - it's loads of fun". why say 
something negative about something else?

i don't know... i haven't been frequenting anywhere as of late, but i 
wouldn't start throwing around terms like "politics" and "not to name 
any names" either. just thought it was a little out there...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce

Okay...I don't have a lot to say on this subject, but I think my roommate
needs a little interpretation...and I do have a few responses, to what
Dori, Kelly and Ed have all said...

> not to butt in - but i can never keep my mouth shut - you all should

Agreed.  Kelly and Cristina can do whatever they want with this night, as
they are the ones organizing it.  And they should.  I don't think Ed was
trying to tell them how things "should" be done, as I know he goes to
Sauce tons, and really enjoys himself there.  I think this was his way of
challenging them perhaps to bring in some new people they haven't yet that
he believes would fit the night's atmosphere and musical stylings, which
are wide.

> i know i must be quoted in the archives 100 times saying this - but if

> opinion, i like havana better".

I don't think Ed was trying to speak for the masses, but rather he was
simply stating his opinion, and perhaps opinions other people have shared
with them. That might not have been clear.  It is in his nature to try to
challenge people, and I assume that's what he was doing.  I don't really
know what "djs" he was referring to, or what the stories (or the rumors)
are behind why they won't be booked at sauce.  I think that's what he was
trying to express, just that he thinks as a club night and a place he
enjoys going to he wishes people would put aside their personal feelings
towards some people and judge whether or not they should ever get a chance
to play there solely on their techinal/musical abilities.  I also think
that by "not naming names" Ed left a lot of room for interpretation, and
so people are putting in their own conclusions about who and what he
really meant.  I do agree with him to an extent, I don't think what your
personal feelings for someone are should affect decisions about their
musical abilities.  But there are always exceptions, like if someone's
behavior or actions were in some way detrimental to the club, the vibe, or
whatever.

> i just think it is so funny that when people don't get booked
> somewhere, it is automatically politics. maybe kelly doesn't like you

I know for a fact Ed was not referring to himself when he was talking
about people who don't get booked.  This has nothing to do with him, and
whether people want him to come play or whatever.  If Kelly and Cristina
or any other people who oversee a club night or event want to give him a
shot, that's entirely a seperate issue, and I know he'd be more than happy
for the chance.  And I give Kelly and Cristina complete props for keeping
sauce going and bringing decent talent and providing Pittsburgh with an
excellent opprotunity to her decent music every week.  I am also totally
with Kelly for stepping up to the plate and calling my roommate out and
telling him if he wants a shot, she'll give him one.  She gets mad respect
from me for that, and I'm sure Ed would gladly accept and appreciate it. 
But it wasn't about him trying to get booked, but rather other people who
I guess aren't and he feels that the only reason they're not is for
personal reasons because their technical abilities are on par.  So this
was his way of challenging them, and probably other club nights to do the
same.

> not trying to be rude or anything ed - but i thought your post was kind
> of coming from nowhere - being that you just moved here a few months
> ago... and i am a stickler for people expressing their opinions and

People always have a tendancy to assume that other people view things the
same way they do.  But when people don't, or when they leave room for
interpretation, things get mixed up and confused.  Oh well, it happens.

Now...on the note of "if you don't like it, why don't you do it your way".
 At times I've thought of that.  Not that I dislike how certain people run
their clubnights, but moreso they way they arrange their talent and the
crowds they cater to.  Everyone would do things their own way if they
could.  And I'm sure if I, Ed, or anyone else were to start a club-night
SOMEONE would have some issue with it or something they think should be
done differently.  You can't take it too personally, because although his
post was aimed at Kelly, I don't think he meant it to be a personal slam,
rather just a challenge.  But I know my roommate pretty well and how he
is, so I know that is just his way.

Now, if anyone wants my opinions on how a club night should be run, who
should be booked, or anything like that, they're more than welcome to ask,
but I don't feel the need to share them cause I don't necessarily as
seeing my way as being better, it's simply what I would like more.

I swear this guy we saw stalled the plane...cause he flew straight up, stopped, and the plane just

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: blue angels in cleveland

I went there one year a while ago and it rained the whole time, so 
only a few of the planes actually took off.  They did refund our 
ticket price some later on.  Been meaning to go back there...on a 
nice day :)

Yeah they always do it labor day weekend.

I'll be there I remember the orig nights but i only made it out to a few and i'll never forget the final Shaky event at the Rat Skeller in Kent on that unfortunate Feb night.  

Majestic216@cs.com wrote:Figured I would pass along the info, since no one else has posted this yet. I hear that the renovated robin hood has a lot of potential, can't wait to get a sneak preview tonight. 

Hopefully this night will be half as succesful as the origanl epiphany nights. Shaky (R.I.P.) broguht in soo much talent back then (Dsl, Tech Itch, Digital, 1.8.7, Pish-Posh, Dara, Ak1200, Future Cut, Usual Suspects, Kaos, Hive, E-sassin, Sage), as well as giving residencies to many of the then up-coming dnb dj's & producers in our area (Pollen, Alaska, Bagel, Andy Sine, Kaos, Dez Drastik, Rob Riddim, Ground Zero, Focus, Tik-Tak, KC & Myself).

Hope to see everyone there.

<<I'm pretty sure they always do it Labor Day Weekend.>>

that would make perfect sense...we got married labor day weekend, and we went to cleveland for our 1
year anniversary...

and before i get any jokes....we was pretty broke, and went on a cruise earlier in the year, so it
was just a short weekend-y kinda trip.

i dig me some cleveland.

Chloe is at Abbasso this weekend on Saturday (part of the warm art series) gotta love the place----always some great DJ's.  : )
 
Also this weekend in Cleveland is the Gravity Games---I just heard  Jane's Addiction is playing Friday (and tickets are only $12 !!!!) So if you didn't want to pay the big bucks at Lollapalooza..here ya go. 
 
This sucks though, I just started grad school classes again and have a ton of work to do, and I love the air show too!   Somebody--convince me to go out!  what to do? what to do?

it out. I can charge tix for us but you guys gotta pay me, remember I AM
unemployed now!!! If I drive my van I could bring along a few peeps too. I
dunno if someone wants to coordinate hit me up. I'm busy today so I may not

IMHO, Buy far the best weekly this area has ever seen.  Those events had the best vibe.  It was like a big weekly party with 300 of my closest friends & the best dnb the world had to offer.  

It's probably going to start off as a bi-weekly.  But, It all deepends on how much support we get.  Headliners will be announced soon.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce

celeste did a good job of saying alot of points that i guess i didnt
emphasize enough, the main one being me getting booked.  I dont beg at all
for bookings, i dont promote myself, if someone asks me to play, i play,
usually for drinks and the nod (going back to the groove thread n 'at).  If
kelly interpreted it as me wanting a booking, wouldn't I have asked her for
one?  but hey, if she wants me to spin, i'll definately step up to the plate
and deliver some deep house and broken beat house which i think fits best
with the venue, I'll promote for myself in the weeks leading up to the show,
i'll have friends come in town to support the night, etc.  but that's a
tangent.  my original point is, everything on the flyers points to sexy and
soulful which imho is deeper sides of music and not scratching, if they
showed 2 hyenas fucking each other on the flyer with teeth showing and
everything, then i'd expect scratching... to address curts post... i agree
that it isnt pigeonholed into one genre per se, but it should stick to some
sort of 'vibe' which to me is the feelgood, smooth, it's the end of the
week, let's fucking chill atmosphere, not the wiccky wickky bow wow
wiiiiiiiick.  The candlelight last week was the shit, it was a great idea
for them to put the teacup candles in the rooms.  The lineup last week was
all towards that smooth vibe i reference, which is why i believe it worked
so well.

as for the if you dont like what people are doing, then do it yourself
comment... planning takes time, and it is something that i have been doing
alot of discussion with quite a few people about, so as you pointed out, i
havent been in this city long, but i do see potential to support it cause
it's way better than what I came from in columbus for diversity.  In
addition to what is here, i see the things that i think would fill in some
gaps, or enhance some of the good points that I have seen.

the original post was made to challenge kelly and cris to put people on the
decks with the talent that fits the vibe regardless of their personal
feelings as well as to state that havana has deep house every thursday
whereas sauce is more diverse in their musical courses they put on the menu.
whether or not they can put aside personal feelings is their business and I
will still support their night as I have been doing.  There is nothing wrong
with asking your server for an extra fork at the restaurant even if they
dont really feel like getting you one.  when you're a promoter, i'm the
customer.  I just fill out the comment cards in hopes that they are
pondered.  Obviously this comment was read by the service provider and I can
only hope that it is somewhat thought about.

jes was asking for suggestions about where to go.  i gave my opinion.  if
you think what goes on in my head is the thoughts of the masses, i
apologize, i never wanted to make that impression. i made statements based
off my experiences, not on hearsay.  I'd think that i've been to enough of
the club nights here to grasp trends and to get a feel for how each promoter
works.  If I dont like a club night, i dont comment about it.  If i like a
club night, i comment about it and state my opinions.

and jenn... freedom of speech is the bomb, yo... i just wish i was there
watching the blue angels with you, watching to some andy rooney or watching
reruns of damon zex to celebrate the freedoms we have.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} fwd: This Saturday in Kent - Epiphany (RETURNS)

I remember i couldn't make it out that night, cause i had to work the next morning. I'll never forget the next day @ work, my mom called & told me what had happened. I didn't feel real. I was in a daze all day, just blankly staring at my computer screen feelin completely numb, wondering why? Even today it all still feels like a bad dream. 

I'll never forget Shaky's enthusiasm for life & dnb. Teh last time i saw him was at one of our nights at the rhythm room. He came out w/ Sine's g/f Jennifer, and he was so excited to finally get things back on track, and how he was planning on starting up epiphany again. He was one of the few people i've ever met that had the same passion for drum n bass that i have. 

Sorry for rambling on, just figured I'd get all that off my chest. 

Apreciate what you have becuase you never know when you might lose it.



easy,

george - majestic

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce


The facts and a few opinions:


I=92ve been reading this thread all day long and this has been my 
first opportunity to respond.

Ed and Tom=92s comments about sauce were based on facts not hearsay.

Cristina booked Adam Ratana and myself to play at Sauce in 
August.  =96 Fact

Adam was scheduled to play on 8th and I was scheduled to play on 
the 15th.  - Fact

Adam and I realized that other people had replaced us when the 
link to the august flyer was emailed to us =96 Fact

After we emailed Kelly to see what the deal was, her response was 
a bit bitchy and unprofessional =96 Opinion

Cristina apologized to Adam and I about being unbooked, and stated 
that this was just a case of miscommunication, between Kelly and 
herself. =96 Fact

Cristina booked me to play at sauce in early October =96 Fact

When I inquired about which date I was playing, her response 
was =93we need to talk about that.=94 =96 Fact

During this conversation I was informed that Adam and I were 
banned from ever playing at sauce because it would make Kelly 
feel =93uncomfortable.=94 (Note: we are still welcome to attend and 
spend our money, which is very nice of her!;) =96 Fact

I think that this is Kelly=92s feeble attempt at getting back at 
Adam and I (due to the personal issues she has), since this was 
the only thing she hold over us =96 Opinion

Kelly and Cristina have the right to book whomever they want at 
sauce, since it=92s their night - Fact

So there you have it the names have been named, and the politics 
behind this particular situation have been brought to light.

I would love to take Kelly up on her challenge that she issued to 
Goose, and I even have Friday in mind. How about when you have 
Mike bee down at Ray=92s in October?  I just played from him while I 
was on vacation in San Francisco (august 9) and I killed it! =96Fact 

(Note: this set will be up on Technoiraudio.com in the near 
future, so all of you will have the opportunity to judge for 
yourself)

Hell would freeze over before Adam or myself would ever be 
welcomed to play at sauce - Fact

If anyone wants to reach me I=92ll be at home listening to my latest 
order from Planet X =96 Fact

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce


all i have to say is, when i play deep house, i
scratch, cause i like to scratch, and i think
scrathing fits in anywhere you can make it fit into,
there aren't any rules. also when i go out i like to
hear some scratching, although i don't expect (or
want) everyone to do it, but when someoone does, it
makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. i think
scratching fits into a deep house night as well as any
other night, and scratching fits extremely well into
my armpits, my head, and sometimes, my pants too.

you know...

im technoir to the end. since these new developments have taken 
place....a few words...

and because of my crew mates were screwed here. i say, let us all 
play friday(or any other friday), or i cant play...it's a conflict 
of interest you know. and my loyalties are to my friends. its just 
the right thing to do you know... who would be down for some 
TECHNOIR flavored sauce...DRAMA free!?!?

"uncomfortable" bah. its about music. its about having a good 
time. i have a great time when i hear my crew mates play. and so 
do the many audiences we've played for.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce

if sauce wasn't political, it is now.  i think i've created both the
positive press and the negative press that would make any politician jealous
of the name recognition.  cris and kelly should put me on the payroll as
campaign manager or someshit.  the more people talk about it both positive
and negative, the more people that will be interested in going to see for
themselves.  say someone comes in town from cleveland and is looking for
something to do on a friday night... they'll remember back to this thread
and be like... i wonder if author x was right, plus i've heard enough good
things to make me want to know what it will mean to me... how I can
interpret the night.  blam.  instant advertising success.

go to sauce and say hi to me, i'm generally in the back room most of the
night chilling and relaxing to the atmosphere from around 10-2, although i
wont be there this weekend only because i'm gonna be in baltimore.  go to
the website and see the dj selection for what would work best for you
http://www.milkrecords.net/sauce

keep it deep

Oh god...that would be funny...the day this country has a hippy (no
offense intended, colin knows I love him) anarchist punk like colin who
wants to live on a big orgy bus for president is the day will be the day
that I get married, have 10 kids, and be a stay-at-home mom.  I love colin
to death, but the conservatives would never allow that.  Colin wouldn't
fit into their agendas and he could probably only be bought with extremely
large quantities of alcohol.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} nrr: blue angels in cleveland


Some of the planes, like the blue angels, hang out at NASA Glen while
there in town for the air show.  Last year I got to talk to one of the
crew, sounds like they have fun military jobs, if there is such a thing.
They handed out ear plugs to us for going by the hanger, those suckers
are loud.  The B1 is really loud, it took off right over the building I
was working in and shook it - I totally forgot about the airshow at the
time and I thought is was an earth quake or some natural phenomina until
I ran outside and saw it.  The blue angles got me while I was eating
lunch in the park by GRC.  They give off some strange chirp sound when
there landing gear  just after take off - I was like what the hell is
that noise - then there was another one and then they came over the tree
tops.

If anyones going up the airshow and wants company let me know, I haven't
been there since I was a kid.  I might just go hang out downtown and
kick it, its just as fun anyware near it uness you like climbing in and
touching planes and handling large guns  ;)  someone should throw a
renegade up there like the old parties in the park over there they used
to have - those were fun ;)

    our new apartment kicks ass. how many places
    can you sit at your computer and watch the blue
    angels flying randomly over the cleveland sky?

    they are mainly circling the burke airport area
    and keeping towards the lake, but every once in
    a while i'll hear "wheeaaaaarrrrhhh" [or
    something like that] as they fly by my window.

    it's going to be a fun weekend viewing the cleveland
    skyline!

    what else is going on in cleveland this weekend?
    [preferably cheap and fun, since i'm still broke]

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} nrr: blue angels in cleveland

I thought they all hang out at hopkins because the runway at burke 
isn't big enough or something.  That seems rediculous since they 
floor it and take off in like 100 feet.  Maybe it's long enough, but 
not enough space around it for them or something. ohh well  I haven't 
there around me yet, usually the days before it you can hear them 
flying past us (we're like 20 miles from cleveland) I guess they come 
down here to get into formation and stuff.

when donkeys fly !

and 'uncomfortable' isn't quite the word.  please.  cristina and i don't
share a brain.  we are freestanding individuals, each with special talents,
unique ideas and gifts.  

but yea...jwan doesn't make me uncomfortable.  it would be more
like having the guy who throws rocks at your puppy over for a pot luck
dinner with your best college buddies. 

i'll write more after sleeptime.  you kids are crazy.

im technoir to the end. since these new developments have taken

and because of my crew mates were screwed here. i say, let us all 
play friday(or any other friday), or i cant play...it's a conflict 
of interest you know. and my loyalties are to my friends. its just 
the right thing to do you know... who would be down for some 
TECHNOIR flavored sauce...DRAMA free!?!?

"uncomfortable" bah. its about music. its about having a good 
time. i have a great time when i hear my crew mates play. and so

Drama            Drama              Drama

Why in gods green earth would you ever feel the need
to let everyone and their mother know your business?
Do you think by telling everyone this shit people are
going to be like.  Thats fucked up.  Kelly and
Cristina should let them play.  meanies.

whatever.  Im sorry. what do you want me to do?  NOW
IT DOES sounds like what Goose was saying he was
trying NOT to get at which is bookings.

I have beef with no one right now (that I know of) -
fact (I feel like I am on one of those drug
commercials...drugs kill people - FACT)

anyway I have beef with no one - fact

when in a "crew" people do things for the goodness of
their peeps. - fact

If that means curt is passing on his night because his
boys can't play with him and because Im not having
all of technoir play. then so be it. and I am sorry if
that is the case.

> Hell would freeze over before Adam or myself would

is this really a fact?  I mean come on jwan is hell
really going to freeze over before sauce dies out. ;)

again this drama is something I was never part of and
actually Im still not.  I wont be. Kelly and I throw
a weekly with friends of ours playing and its fun! I
think October and November are going to be great
months for Sauce.  and I think most of you will agree.
and i hope most of you stop down once in a while.

can we try to not kill a good thing?  We need you all
there Im not going to lie about that. Jwan I am not
asking you to come down and spend money.  I am asking
you to support something when its something you like
and even if it is something you dont.  If you no
longer feel welcome I am sorry.

there are weeks that our DJs are not always playing
exactly what I, personally want to hear.  and there
are weeks Kevins scratching gets on my nerves too. 
but those weeks.  when not everyone is around.  and
these mainstreamers are there dancing till 2:30 and
buying drinks till 2.  we need those people sometimes
too.  we need those people on the nights my ass is
broke and so is everyone else's and we aren't spending
money but some locals pop in and spend $50 each which
keeps sauce going.  we aren't charging at the door.
the drink prices are definitely reasonable. sometimes
we need them so the music that bothers you and they
are totally digging - I am sorry.

I just one big fucking sorry mobile today because all
I wanted to do *sniff sniff* was have a fun night
where no one would have to pay to come down after work
*sniff* and listen to good music.

I need a Kleenex.

(I cant believe I just posted to the list. What year
is it again?)

Did you guys hear Dan Mnookin when he was at Abbasso?  That was some mighty-fine straight up techno.  Floor-killing, danced my ass off kind of night.

well the feeling isn't mutual.  my only consolation is
that karma will fukc you in the ass, if he's strong
enough to spread those massive cheeks of yours.

: : anyway I have beef with no one - fact

do your homework, b1tch.  spending the night with jwan
on at least one occasion made you bring the drama on
yourself.  in addition to telling me how much he loves
me while he's laying next to you in bed, "oh, i would
never do that to you, jwan loves you a lot"
that shows me (and the list) what your word is worth,
absolutely nothing.  cristina is a liar with no

encountered.

i thought playing some beatdown at someone's night
would help with the pittsburgh scene diversity, but
you're all too busy laughing at me getting thrown

you're just plain sorry.  those guys are the best
thing going in pittsburgh right now, and if they want
to play together, that is the decision of the artists.
 do theater managers choose which dancers can dance
any particular night?  no, because the whole group had
a dynamic that cannot be reproduced alone (although
the technoir guys are great alone too).  technoir as a
group is the best (and cheapest) show that you could
book in pittsburgh and elsewhere.  dozens of detroit
heads can't be wrong.

you'd love for me to stop down, right?  oh, i forgot,
i'm all booked up in detroit at the moment, leaving
your pathetic asses in pittsburgh.  as more people see
your true colors and hate you, i'm sure the night will
be even more successful!  and don't think norm talley

your shitty night.  we have higher standards than

Check out Dan Petrov's Warm Art nights at
Abbasso...Dan's doing a great thing trying to push
intelligent techno.  It's generally the second
saturday of each month, but there are occasional
special events.  John Tejada will be the guest on
September 13.

Hope this helps,

well the feeling isn't mutual.  my only consolation is that karma will fuck
you in the ass, if he's strong enough to spread those massive cheeks of

: : anyway I have beef with no one - fact

do your homework, bitch.  spending the night with jwan on at least one
occasion made you bring the drama on yourself.  in addition to telling me
how much he loves me while he's laying next to you in bed, "oh, i would
never do that to you, jwan loves you a lot"
that shows me (and the list) what your word is worth, absolutely nothing.
cristina is a liar with no conscience, even worse than the shady club owners
i've encountered.

i thought playing some beatdown at someone's night would help with the
pittsburgh scene diversity, but you're all too busy laughing at me getting
thrown through a wall (it's very classy to laugh at domestic violence).

: : If that means curt is passing on his night because his

: : that is the case.

you're just plain sorry.  those guys are the best thing going in pittsburgh
right now, and if they want to play together, that is the decision of the
artists.  do theater managers choose which dancers can dance any particular
night?  no, because the whole group had a dynamic that cannot be reproduced
alone (although the technoir guys are great alone too).  technoir as a group
is the best (and cheapest) show that you could book in pittsburgh and
elsewhere.  dozens of detroit heads can't be wrong.

you'd love for me to stop down, right?  oh, i forgot, i'm all booked up in
detroit at the moment, leaving your pathetic asses in pittsburgh.  as more
people see your true colors and hate you, i'm sure the night will be even
more successful!  and don't think norm talley or any deep house dj from
detroit will ever come to your shitty night.  we have higher standards than
that.  he was only there because of the warhol gig, don't flatter yourself.

there's some really good talent that will be coming through that night.
in fact, one of my favorite producers will be playing there in either
october or november.  the next few months will have more of the deeper
side of techno and tech-house but before long i think we'll see some
nasty shit up in it.

i deeply hope it gets the support it deserves.  i know columbus will
reprazhent y0.

Check out Dan Petrov's Warm Art nights at
Abbasso...Dan's doing a great thing trying to push
intelligent techno.  It's generally the second
saturday of each month, but there are occasional
special events.  John Tejada will be the guest on
September 13.

Hope this helps,

hold up, freak.  don't get me tangled up in whatever dork orgy you have
going on over there.  i saw jwan's ass one time and that was at the beach
last summer.  ben leto did too.  i think there are photos floating around
somewhere.  i'll have to dig them up.

anyway

i can't get that "all this scratching is making me itch" voice out of my
head.  you guys picking on kevin (and i'm feeling a sort of angry
tone...hmmm ;) reminds me of when girls look at supermodels and say things
like, "don't you think her feet are really ugly ?"

: : I have beef with no one right now (that I know of) -
: : fact (I feel like I am on one of those drug
: : commercials...drugs kill people - FACT)

well the feeling isn't mutual.  my only consolation is that karma will fukc
you in the ass, if he's strong enough to spread those massive cheeks of
yours.

: : anyway I have beef with no one - fact

do your homework, bitch.  spending the night with jwan on at least one
occasion made you bring the drama on yourself.  in addition to telling me
how much he loves me while he's laying next to you in bed, "oh, i would
never do that to you, jwan loves you a lot"
that shows me (and the list) what your word is worth, absolutely nothing.
cristina is a liar with no conscience, even worse than the shady club owners
i've encountered.

: : when in a "crew" people do things for the goodness of
: : their peeps. - fact

i thought playing some beatdown at someone's night would help with the
pittsburgh scene diversity, but you're all too busy laughing at me getting
thrown through a wall (it's very classy to laugh at domestic violence).

: : If that means curt is passing on his night because his
: : boys can't play with him and because Im not having
: : all of technoir play. then so be it. and I am sorry if
: : that is the case.

you're just plain sorry.  those guys are the best thing going in pittsburgh
right now, and if they want to play together, that is the decision of the
artists.  do theater managers choose which dancers can dance any particular
night?  no, because the whole group had a dynamic that cannot be reproduced
alone (although the technoir guys are great alone too).  technoir as a group
is the best (and cheapest) show that you could book in pittsburgh and
elsewhere.  dozens of detroit heads can't be wrong.

: : > Hell would freeze over before Adam or myself would
: : > ever be
: : > welcomed to play at sauce - Fact
: : >
: :
: : is this really a fact?  I mean come on jwan is hell
: : really going to freeze over before sauce dies out. ;)
: :
: : again this drama is something I was never part of and
: : actually Im still not.  I wont be. Kelly and I throw
: : a weekly with friends of ours playing and its fun! I
: : think October and November are going to be great
: : months for Sauce.  and I think most of you will agree.
: : and i hope most of you stop down once in a while.

you'd love for me to stop down, right?  oh, i forgot, i'm all booked up in
detroit at the moment, leaving your pathetic asses in pittsburgh.  as more
people see your true colors and hate you, i'm sure the night will be even
more successful!  and don't think norm talley or any deep house dj from
detroit will ever come to your shitty night.  we have higher standards than
that.  he was only there because of the warhol gig, don't flatter yourself.

: : can we try to not kill a good thing?  We need you all

maybe you should fukc him again, he'd feel welcome then.  or maybe if you
and kelly carter stop fukcing other women's boyfriends, you'll keep more
female friends who will support you.

: : I just one big fucking sorry mobile today because all
: : I wanted to do *sniff sniff* was have a fun night
: : where no one would have to pay to come down after work

good, why don't you ask your monkey for one?

i don't know what year it is either, can we count your rolls?  kinda like
counting the rings on a tree...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce


ok, this is getting WAAAAY out of hand. lets try not to mix the 
business end with the personal end. 

christina, i've known you for more years than i'd admit...(prolly 
about 8..) i consider you a friend, and i respect what you are 
doing with your club night.

kelly, i respect that you are trying to keep a record store and 
club night going. you both know i have frequented both of your 
establishments, and spent money/supported both...in fact, sauce 
was the only club nite i go to!

what i can say is this. I have a long lasting friendship with my 
crew mates. i made the decision to step back on my own. it 
just...wouldnt be right if my friends arent AS welcome in your 
establishment as I am. think of it as having black friends back in 
the 50's in the south...

i really dont care who's "melroseing" with who,and i has NO place 
in the argument.. all i know is the bottom line...and until this 
foolish battle over nothing(really..this aint no shit to fight 
about) ends, i cant bring myself to play at, or patronize your 
establishments. 5-10 years from now we will all forget this stuff, 
and move on. really, we are all too damned old for this shit. in 
the mean time, folks who like to read this stuff, and hear 
technoir, you can catch us at Momentum 1 year anniversary next 
weekend, and of course, the Technoir showcase at Havana sept. 18th
(again, thank you Jason and Mike(aka willie dynamite) peeps for 
allowing us to play again). there is one unconfirmed at the rex on 
sept 3rd...stay tuned.

That kiss was freaking hot.  And it was awesome.  I don't respect 2/3 of the 
"singers" on that stage.  But regardless that kiss was freaking hot.

just a check here to make sure everyone's excitement isn't just that 
senseless notion often put forth by straight men that lesbians would have 
any interest in including them in sex with another woman ---

if that kiss was one shared by eminem, justin timberlake and 50 cent ... 
would it have been so hot?

discuss...  i'm going to buy stock in kimberly-clark

wel of course not alan, we are all just living the dream:)

madonna's recent material sucks (i've been a fan since day one, 
and i'm not afraid to admit it) - but the kiss was a nice cheap 
thrill, on a show celebrating bad pop music (for the most part). 
This is why i pay for basic cable.

I think Eminem is rather butt, looks-wise.  But I would say that if the kiss
were between Prince, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, and 50 cent, I would have
gone absolutely ballistic.

Subject: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland

This is a pretty good indication of narrow-minded genre wars...Just because someone is known for one thing doesn't mean that's all they play...

FOR EXAMPLES ...

We brought out Mazi, who some put in the deep house box, on August 9...The dood dropped three hours of straight mind-fucking sick pure techno. How many of you missed that night because you saw "house" in the description and stayed home? 

Meghan -- we had her open for our Porter show in July. She knows we like techno. She mixes in techno with her progressive records. Right, Meghan?  :)

Deviant -- The dood plays deep and hard and progressive and techno and trance. Anyone remember when he dropped an hour of Beyer and Carola on us? (I do, 'cause I bought the records tee hee) 

Soooooo....don't biatch until you've been out to hear how diverse the talent is, at least at our parties...We aren't your average lounge promoter.

Would we like to bring Hawtin or Atkins or Cox? Sure we would. But are there enough of you out there to financially support it?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sauce

this whole email thing take too much time.  i can't sit here and read list
mail all day.

curt, if you and jwan and adam have 30 minutes to spare this evening, i'll be
at milk until 9pm.  you are on the flyer for tonight.  if you aren't playing,
you aren't playing.  if you'd like to hear about why adam was 'unbooked', i'd
be glad to talk with you.  i never said anything about future bookings.  i
doubt we'd ever have 5 or 6 guys play at a time simply due to the small space.
 jwan was booked the first month.  the lounge had a power outage that night. 
you were booked for tonight and arnie is on our list for oct/nov.  that's a
damn good percentage. a lot of people want spots.  a lot of people who don't
give me grief want spots.  and like dori said, we're the ones hosting this. 
we can book our moms every week if we want to.  how is this so difficult to
understand ?

i'm not going to pretend things are peachy at this point.  let things happen
naturally.  you guys were all there on new year's eve when i made the fatal
mistake of sticking up for a girl who was being disrecpected and humiliated by
"the crew" at the milk party.  THAT is the reason it's come to this.  but fuck
it.  i'd stick up for her again.  at the risk of sounding like your mother,
you should be ashamed of yourselves.  if i need to be your excuse, i'll just
have to be fine with that.

like i said, i'll be at milk til 9.

kelly

just put phat shit by the dj's name instead
of genre.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland

    i've  been to abbasso three times or so, i've yet
    to hear anything that resembles techno there.
    i'm not going to give up on the club, however, i'm
    also not going to go out unless i have a good chance
    of hearing techno, breakbeats, dnb or if i get dragged
    out kicking and screaming :p

    you can call it a narrow-minded genre war, i'm
    just really tired of hearing house music all night
    long. if it isn't house, it's progressive. whatever,
    i like techno. i like music that's a little more raw,
    something that makes me want to dance. house
    and progressive just don't do it for me. i like raves,
    i'm not that much of a clubber. i generally don't like
    house music. most people that know me, know that
    about me.

    i want more than techno mixed in with progressive.
    i want straight up techno.

    i missed mazi, and i'm a little annoyed about it.
    however, i was hoping to catch some deep funk
    of king britt, silly me. king britt for me was free,
    mazi was $8 if i rsvp'ed. i'm still looking for a job,
    so free is good in my book.

    also, i wouldn't say i'm bitching, i'm simply asking
    for techno, that's all. if you think that's bitching, you
    just wait! i don't know if all the nights i came to at
    abbasso were your nights or not. i think two of them
    were - no techno there, just house and progressive.

    anyway...

    the blue angels are back :]

I have no false hope of ever sleeping with a lesbian.  Although I did once
attempt to ask a lesbian friend of mine if I could test my technique on her,
only half kidding.

A bi-curious chick, on the other hand.  Or just a straight girl who's a bit
open or experiemental.  Or just slutty and in need of attention.

Brother, I'm down for that.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland

Tonight, you'll probably hear a little of everything, given the three guys
who are playing. (Darbe, Brandon Gill, and Deviant).

One thing is guaranteed: The people who are there are there to hear the
music. (I wish I could say the same for every other place in Cleveland.)

Fridays at Abbasso are normal hours, not afterhours. 9pm-2:30am, so see you
early.

I mix techno with my santorum.  I mean... hi all, i'll be at sauce
tonight... walking my ass down the street cause my clutch cable decided to
take a shit on me when i was about 50 miles outside of pittsburgh on the way
to maryland and i cant get a part till tomorrow morning, but luckily i was
able to drive clutchless back here to my homestead, so yeah, you'll find me
in the back room of sauce tonight, as usual.  come and tell me i'm an
asshole or buy me a drink to ease the pains of owning a perpetual
transmission problem car. (1700 dollars and counting this year)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland

    i actually had an email started on that. too
    bad i deleted it without saving it first :-/

    i think it would be great if you brought out
    any of those three. i would also really like
    to hear adam beyer, christian smith, mike
    dearborn, misjah and the list goes on.

    however, why can't you bring out a good
    techno dj / act that wouldn't require major
    financial support?

    there's lots of great techno out there, and
    nobody would have to go broke trying to
    bring them in.

    i'm looking forward to the warm art night
    jamie posted about (thanks for the heads
    up :-).

    would you get enough financial support if
    you brought in the three djs you mentioned?

    i think you would, if it were promoted properly,
    and the price was right.

    it's hard for people to drop $20+ on any one
    dj these days though, at least it is for me.
    however, i think i'd save the loot in order to
    see most of the djs listed above.

    abbasso is a nice intimate club, but could you get
    the numbers you need to pull off one of those
    djs to all fit? i don't think so. (not sure how many
    people fit in there, but i think it's pretty close to
    the number i can get in my apartment)

    i'm simply asking for more techno. once upon
    a time cleveland would support techno. i really
    don't know what the deal is these days. we quit
    promoting a few years back and haven't gone
    out much in the meantime.

    however, we just moved to cleveland and i would
    be thrilled to support a night that played techno
    on a regular basis.

    that also goes for other genres - dnb, breakbeats,
    anything that pushes the house / prog envelope.

    not too sure what to say. we went out tuesday
    night to hear dan curtin. there weren't many
    people there. i don't know how well it was promoted
    though, and the middle of the week is a big turn
    off for me, since my bf works a regular job.

    anyone else have anything to say? i'd be curious
    if cleveland would support a solid techno night.
    i guess we'll see :]

Highly unlikely. No. As someone else privately wrote me, "You'd lose your
ass." And frankly, based on our experience with testing the waters here with
the Summer Series, I'd say he's right.

Yes, it's small. Holds about 200. But seriously, and without going into a
lot of bitchy discussion about anywhere else, where else would we do
anything? I've heard and seen too much BS and drama about everywhere else.
I've felt too many bad vibes other places. I've had too many drunken
biatches stumble over me and look at me like I'm unworthy because I'm in
tennis shoes everywhere else. If there's a bigger club willing to work with
a promoter who wants an open-minded atmosphere, hit me up.

>     that also goes for other genres - dnb, breakbeats,

I hear ya...But, having said that, one of the reasons we started doing what
we're doing was to fill what we felt was a musical void in Cleveland. Shift
had techno, jungle lounge at Spy had its thing, Sundays at the Bottom Line
had a ton of DnB, Breaks, one-offs were breeding BadBoyBill-style house like
rabbits, places on W6th were carrying on with the jazzy house tip...Nowhere
I went did I hear the Yunus Guvenen mindfuck going on.

I think that "house" and "prog" are extremely broad over-generalized names
and there is a hell of a lot going on in those genres that people probably
haven't heard before and are unfortunately discounting just because it's
four-to-the-floor and has the words "house" and "prog" in it.

Words are not sufficient to describe music, people. It's its own language.

So, techno DJs...Where are ya? I approached Mike months and months ago,
asked for a demo...never got it...

Guess the blue angels land hang out at the lake, not NASA GRC.  I was
thinking of the thunderbirds.

I thought they all hang out at hopkins because the runway at burke 
isn't big enough or something.  That seems rediculous since they 
floor it and take off in like 100 feet.  Maybe it's long enough, but 
not enough space around it for them or something. ohh well  I haven't 
there around me yet, usually the days before it you can hear them 
flying past us (we're like 20 miles from cleveland) I guess they come 
down here to get into formation and stuff.

I think technically you can only sleep with a bi woman because the
instant you go to sleep with a lessbian, she becomes bi, therefore in a
paradoxal catch 22, you become your own cock blocker, and thus fail
every time.  I think the most you can hope for is convert a lesbian to
bi for a span of time, lol

Okay Ridley, I have to correct you on this.  Just because you sleep with
someone of the opposite, for whatever reason, does not necessarily make
you bi.  It has to do with who you're attracted to.  If that, all the gay
married men who sleep with women are technically bi.  But they're not. 
Sleeping with a guy, if you're a lesbian doesn't mean you suddenly like
dick, as much as you men *wish* that were true.

I don't really like those boys.  Eminem maybe, but only if I could slap
him around a lot first.  That would rule.  But say...Heath Ledger, Edward
Norton and Luke Wilson.  God...I'm drooling over here.

actually, EVERYONE is bi.  society doesn't let everyone accept that though.
sex is sex and everyone, whether you can admit it or not, is attracted to 
people of both sexes.  which sex you prefer for a relationship, however, is 
a matter of choice.

just adding my jar of petrol...

Damn this is tha most drama I've ever fucking seen on this list... and I should know...
 
I dunno if yall shouldve shared as much info with tha whole world... 
 
My only input is that... Adam Ratana is a great DJ and should be booked to play anywhere... I've heard Jwan is good, but never heard him myself.
 
If you really have no beef w/ anyone, chick... then why dont yall honor your commitments.
 
my 5 cents.

well the feeling isn't mutual. my only consolation is that karma will fuck
you in the ass, if he's strong enough to spread those massive cheeks of
yours.

: : anyway I have beef with no one - fact

do your homework, bitch. spending the night with jwan on at least one
occasion made you bring the drama on yourself. in addition to telling me
how much he loves me while he's laying next to you in bed, "oh, i would
never do that to you, jwan loves you a lot"
that shows me (and the list) what your word is worth, absolutely nothing.
cristina is a liar with no conscience, even worse than the shady club owners
i've encountered.

i thought playing some beatdown at someone's night would help with the
pittsburgh scene diversity, but you're all too busy laughing at me getting
thrown through a wall (it's very classy to laugh at domestic violence).

: : If that means curt is passing on his night because his

: : that is the case.

you're just plain sorry. those guys are the best thing going in pittsburgh
right now, and if they want to play together, that is the decision of the
artists. do theater managers choose which dancers can dance any particular
night? no, because the whole group had a dynamic that cannot be reproduced
alone (although the technoir guys are great alone too). technoir as a group
is the best (and cheapest) show that you could book in pittsburgh and
elsewhere. dozens of detroit heads can't be wrong.

you'd love for me to stop down, right? oh, i forgot, i'm all booked up in
detroit at the moment, leaving your pathetic asses in pittsburgh. as more
people see your true colors and hate you, i'm sure the night will be even
more successful! and don't think norm talley or any deep house dj from
detroit will ever come to your shitty night. we have higher standards than
that. he was only there because of the warhol gig, don't flatter yourself.

I mix techno with my santorum. I mean... hi all, i'll be at sauce
tonight... walking my ass down the street cause my clutch cable decided to
take a shit on me when i was about 50 miles outside of pittsburgh on the way
to maryland and i cant get a part till tomorrow morning, but luckily i was
able to drive clutchless back here to my homestead, so yeah, you'll find me
in the back room of sauce tonight, as usual. come and tell me i'm an
asshole or buy me a drink to ease the pains of owning a perpetual
transmission problem car. (1700 dollars and counting this year)

well i was told deep house.  i just went because my friends were headed 
that way and well it was something to do.  lucky me i got there just 
about when the house ended and the techno started.  so it was a most 
pleasant surprise.   i'd really never have gone on my own thinking it 
was "deep house" without something else going on.    =)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland

	You said it, I'd love to seem some Beyer or Lekenbush or some other 
big name act, but It's understandable that with the crowd Cleveland has 
to offer it might turn into a big FLOP. Mike Dearborn is playing in 
Toledo with Da-Crude even though Dearborn would top off my list from 
that lineup.  Anyways, the tag is 35,  and thats lil too much for me 
these days.
	It is a shame though, that we do honestly lack a true TECHNO night. I 
talked to John who does Electra Soul and I might the drive out to the 
burgh on a school fucking wednesday night,  so long as it meant that I 
would hear good musik for a few hours.
	O, and Amy, whats da deal with the 21+ on Abasso? No cover for the 
18-21 crowd? I know its a bar and its reaching for a certain maturity 
level, but at times I feel that I might as well attend some dinky house 
party or whatever else clevr happens on weekends around here (not 
much), since I cant go out and hear musik I dig and perhaps a chance to 
catch some headliner. Well at least tell me what entrance to sneak in 
through!?  ;-)

I don't want to start a request list, but honestly, let's bring in some 
Dave Clarke. Im probably (one of) the only person(s) in the world whos 
seen and heard HOURS upon HOURS of live videos and sets of this guy, 
and yet, missed to him see him once (not that he's been in the vicinity 
recently).

Alex

p.s. Theirs plenty of house and progressive to cover the world 3 times 
over with all the records out now...So what were those damn Oaken-dick 
fans and Sasha-Weeds saying back in 98 when their super dj gods stopped 
playing trance and decided to spin...progressive...? Wait, is there 
some kind of pattern here? Kwik, someone pick up the latest Global 
Underground!?!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland

electrasoul is 21+ too... actually i cant think of a club night here in pgh
that is not 21+.

you've done nothing but impress me for your demeanor at your age alex, but
the maturity levels of the average 18-20 year old make you the exception,
not the rule.  the way to get around this:  DJ.  That's what I did in
columbus, it was an easy way to be in some 21+ places as a 19/20 year old.
when you're 'part of the band' people dont mess with you.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland

> So, techno DJs...Where are ya? 

Andy James and I have been right here for the past
several years - and that's if you're lookin for the
serious, hard-pounding techno that's like my foot in
your ass goin bang bang bang! (that's as far as hard
techno djs in cleveland goes - can't think of anyone
else right now, sorry if I missed someone)BUT, here we
sit b/c usually ppl seem to want more proggy, trancey
whatever stuff around here - I know I have been asked
several times before being given some gigs things
like, "hey you think you could tone it down a bit for
this one" or "you got anything that isn't so weird, or
so, well, scary?" "how bout somethin that's not so
dark or banging." And then when we do play that stuff
out, we get a small handful of ppl pumpin their fists
and then other fokes walk away in either fear or
wanting something more "ear-friendly" I guess, I don't
know. So what I ask is, Cleveland ppl and promoters
wanting this "real hard-ass bangin techno" - where are
YOU?? and I'm talking about Glen Wilson, Hardcell,
Stigmata, Slobodan type shit not Marco Carola (no
offense against him, I like him quite a bit, but he is
definitely not the hard bangin stuff). And about the
demo issues - Andy and I have been playing out
sporadically now for the past 6 or 7 years, so seeing

You don't even have to be *attracted* to someone in order to fuck them, if you're a woman...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland

I love this line: "hard-pounding techno that's like my foot in your ass goin 
bang bang bang!"

I think it would make a good tagline for the list. :-)

I love *scary* music. Once in a while I'll mention it to someone who isn't 
hip to "good music" and they just can't fathom how music can be scary. It 
would be funny to drop them in a party with rough shit kicking out of some 
serious cabinets. They would probably take a dump from the sensory overload.

 > So, techno DJs...Where are ya?

Andy James and I have been right here for the past
several years - and that's if you're lookin for the
serious, hard-pounding techno that's like my foot in
your ass goin bang bang bang! (that's as far as hard
techno djs in cleveland goes - can't think of anyone
else right now, sorry if I missed someone)BUT, here we
sit b/c usually ppl seem to want more proggy, trancey
whatever stuff around here - I know I have been asked
several times before being given some gigs things
like, "hey you think you could tone it down a bit for
this one" or "you got anything that isn't so weird, or
so, well, scary?" "how bout somethin that's not so
dark or banging." And then when we do play that stuff
out, we get a small handful of ppl pumpin their fists
and then other fokes walk away in either fear or
wanting something more "ear-friendly" I guess, I don't
know. So what I ask is, Cleveland ppl and promoters
wanting this "real hard-ass bangin techno" - where are
YOU?? and I'm talking about Glen Wilson, Hardcell,
Stigmata, Slobodan type shit not Marco Carola (no
offense against him, I like him quite a bit, but he is
definitely not the hard bangin stuff). And about the
demo issues - Andy and I have been playing out
sporadically now for the past 6 or 7 years, so seeing
us bang out our shit live for that long is enough for
us to be like, hey you want the hard shit, eh, well
here we are!!!! AND I'm dead serious and have been now
for the past couple of years about a 3X6 - Colin
Pierce, would you be up for something like this??

I tried Rino Cerrone, Stewart Walker and Gaetano Parisio, nobody cared or
maybe it cost to much or maybe the space was tired.  I dunno.  My point is,
I wouldn't try another show in Cleveland even if it was your money instead

i've been hoping for a techno night in cleveland for a
looooooooong time. we have some damn fine techno dj's
that can all bring it! cleveland hasn't been much of a
techno town since 98-99' when shortarm brought in all
of the big names like adam beyer, surgeon, joel
mull... i'm not too worried because i can always play
in other cities that appreciate good techno, like
detroit, chicago, and pittsburgh(electrasoul).

keep techno sexy.........

peace,

but you gotta love:

>tlc - creep

and this:

>toots & the maytals - 54-46 (that's my number)

is the fucking tune. 

these kinds of CDs are what more deejays' sets should be like. im

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland

long live dj boompsie!!!!!!!!!

i'm down for starting a pb-cle techno collective!!!
our cities each have bomb ass techno dj's, however
there isn't anywhere for us to showcase our
shit(except for electrasoul and warm art). whenever i
scan down the rom, i can usually count the techno dj's
booked at all of the parties on one hand. i know there
are a lot of people on this list that like techno. we
just need more promoters like john b. and
randy(technacolour!!!) who take risks and bring the
techno proper. even toledo is bringing in the techno
these days, just not cleveland. oh well, at least we
have bent crayon.........

i'm all about a 3x6 with sherry and colin, anyone
intersted??? i know i am......... 

i love all this talk of techno, it makes me all warm
and fuzzy inside. time to play some size 10 1/2 adidas
deep inside your ass techno that goes bang, bang,
bang, boooooooooom.

word,
--andy james--

i think the stuff you guys are talking about should be
reclassified as hard house. its more similar to that stuff than
techno. i call it cracker techno. that shit gives me a headache.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} swing house

I like that. Its pretty hot in my opinion.

Still love my jungle though. Lately, this has been in the system:

JB - Back2Basics - History in the Mix

Also,

DJ Craze - United DJs of America vol16

Pretty dirty

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: techno in Cleveland


you know, i've played techno, albeit some very clubby
techno, in front of alot of "i don't like techno"
people, and i almost always have people either
dancing, watching, or pumping fists(or all 3) when i'm
playing. people just think they don't like techno till
they hear somebody who doesnt play boring techno, and
play it like it's trance. the big problem is there's
alot of lame techno dj's out there, but pgh and cleve
have some damn fine djs who get slept on by alot of
people who would probably like them if they would give
it a chance.
