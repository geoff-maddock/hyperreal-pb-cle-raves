Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Tek-Know presents
3 Channels (Poland)

Touch Supper Club
2710 Lorain Ave
Cleveland, Ohio 44113

3 Channels are Deeop (Grzegorz Demianczuk) and Ketiov (Wojciech
Taranczuk). Their acquaintance began in 2003 when Ketiov started to
spin his first records in clubs like Sonar and Taras Caffe and Deeop
was already widely known for his enormous records collection and
participation in every party in the city of Stettin.

In late 2003 they organized their first mutual party at Mezzoforte
club, which appeared to be a huge success. Logically the became
resident dj's there, which gave them a chance to organize their own
parties simply named "Electronic House". The idea was to promote new
dance music completely different from what was played in most of the
polish clubs at the time. The "Electronic House" parties had the
privilege to welcome such people as: Tom Clark, Dub Taylor, John
Tejada, Antonelli Electr, Wighnomy Brothers, Todd Bodine, Matthias
Tanzmann and Duplex 100.

In September 2003 they broadcasted their first radio show called
"Session" at the local ABC Radio alongside with their old mate Vitek.
After a year "Session" evolved into the 3 Channels project. Later the
radio show was broadcasted under the name of "Plastelina" and could be
heard ever Thursday from 6 pm to 7 pm. "Plastelina" has no sound
limits and has one goal, which is to promote modern electronic music
from down tempo to electronic, tech-house or techno music.
After half a year of co-operation with Votchik 3 channels decided to
star producing... They released their 2 first records on Trenton
("Split EP" and "Superficial") then followed by 1 EP on each Trapez
and Crosstown Rebel which showed a more minimal side of their work!

All these releases showed that 3 Channels could be versatile artists
and collected a lot of good reviews all over the world on medias like
BBC or the popular Anjas Schneider's radio show "Dance Under The Blue
Moon"... They are now starting to do remixes for people such as Jacek
Sienkiewicz, Maetrik, Richard Bartz, Codec'n Flexor and are releasing
new productions on labels like Trenton, Crosstown Rebels, Trapez and
Resopal.

Sun Sep 02                          DJ T                         Pittsburgh

Thomas Koch (aka DJ T) is one of the most influential faces in dance music
today. Over the past 20 years he has held residencies at top venues from
the Frankfurt club scene such as Music Hall, Plastik, Dorian Gray, XS and
The Box; started Groove - one of Germanys biggest music magazines, and
opened the world famous club Monza in Frankfurt. All of this is well and
good, but its his work in the past five years that has really aimed the
worldwide clubbing spotlight towards him. In 2002, DJ T founded 'Get
Physical Music' along with the guys behind M.A.N.D.Y. and Booka Shade.
Since then, Get Physical has dominated DJ charts and the global press,
turning the industry upside down and single-handedly taking the
minimal/electro scene in a new direction.

Humanaut would like to invite you to an evening of upfront,
forward-thinking dance music as DJ T makes Pittsburgh (and Humanaut's 1
year anniversary party) one of only six stops in his North American tour.
The experience may just change your contact solution.

      YOU need to READ this!!!
       
     I just have to tell everyone that I just viewed the sweetest venue.  If any of you have been to any shows this year or in the past you must be at this one. I am going to attempt to describe what can only be completely understood in person, the best place for a music show that I have not seen around here in years.
                During the day starting 12 noon you can swim or hang out at a giant swimming pool with water slides as you listen to some house music play in the back ground.  If swimming is not your thing go up the stairs to the air-conditioned banquet hall with a nice dance floor, where the DJ Battle and Break Dancers will be tearing it up.  Around 8 pm the doors in the banquet hall will open up to a hallway that will lead you to bliss.  As you enter the lobby DEEP HOUSE MUSIC will be playing for what will be a sweet ass chill room with windows viewing a huge ice hockey arena.  The ice is gone only the concrete floor remains for you to dance your way up to the big stage where you will see, hear, and feel a massive sound system.  To describe the sound in how many watts is bull shit I’ll tell you it takes a lot of power to run 8 horns, 16 12” midrange woofers, 16 18” subwoofers stacked up high.  We will even have 4 speaker monitors for the djs to mix their ass off with.
                All of this and more with some of the best local, regional, and 4 top notch producer/ DJ headliners.  This is sure to be the most talked about event in years and for years to come.  So I’m saying if you are an old school head or new school head that has ever complained about high price, bad sound, and shitty venues then your prayers have been answered and I’ll see you here.
                This will be decorated in a luau style for the show of the year ALOHA so bring your swimsuit and your dancing shoes for a paradise of 16 hours with banging sounds, family and friends.  Saturday August 4th 2007 for directions call THE LINE 412 542 1717.
      Much love,
BIGB

Crap, I will be in NY this weekend.  But good luck with this.  I
really think that most events locally have been marred by shit sound
to be honest.  It's become the norm instead of the exception in recent
years.  Even when there have been big stacks.  So that's goood that
you are bringing all that sound.  Any "music" event, the sound should
be the #1 thing after the music itself...

I once danced a polka dance while bathing naked in a fountain of badger milk.
The milk went into my nostrils. Polkamilk.

    YOU need to READ this!!!
       
      I just have to tell everyone that I just viewed the sweetest venue.  If any of you have been to any shows this year or in the past you must be at this one. I am going to attempt to  describe what can only be completely understood in person, the best place for a music show that I have not seen around here in years.
  
                During the day starting 12 noon you can swim or hang out at a giant swimming pool with water slides as you listen to some house music play in the back ground.  If swimming is not your thing go up the stairs to the air-conditioned banquet hall with a nice dance floor, where the DJ Battle and Break Dancers will be tearing it up.  Around 8 pm the doors in the banquet hall will open up to a hallway that will lead you to bliss.  As you enter the lobby DEEP HOUSE MUSIC will be playing for what will be a sweet ass chill room with windows viewing a huge ice hockey arena.  The ice is gone only the concrete floor remains for you  to dance your way up to the big stage where you will see, hear, and feel a massive sound system.  To describe the sound in how many watts is bull shit I’ll tell you it takes a lot of power to run 8 horns, 16 12” midrange woofers, 16 18” subwoofers stacked up high.  We will even have 4 speaker monitors for the djs to mix their ass off with.
  
                All of this and more with some of the best local, regional, and 4 top notch producer/ DJ headliners.  This is sure to be the most talked about event in years and for years to come.  So I’m saying if you are an old school head or new school head that has ever complained about high price, bad sound, and shitty venues then your prayers have been answered and I’ll see you here.
  
                 This will be decorated in a luau style for the show of the year ALOHA so bring your swimsuit and your dancing shoes for a paradise of 16 hours with banging sounds, family and friends.  Saturday August 4th 2007 for directions call THE LINE 412 542 1717.
  
    Much love,
 BIGB

Nasty good drum'n bass for dancing.

I am only the sound tech but I can tell you that the pool is open to the
public for a fee if you are coming to the show you only pay the show cost
and swimming is included only till 8pm. bigb

YOU need to READ this!!!
      
     I just have to tell everyone that I just viewed the sweetest venue.  If
any of you have been to any shows this year or in the past you must be at
this one. I am going to attempt to describe what can only be completely
understood in person, the best place for a music show that I have not seen
around here in years.

            During the day starting 12 noon you can swim or hang out at a
giant swimming pool with water slides as you listen to some house music play
in the back ground.  If swimming is not your thing go up the stairs to the
air-conditioned banquet hall with a nice dance floor, where the DJ Battle
and Break Dancers will be tearing it up.  Around 8 pm the doors in the
banquet hall will open up to a hallway that will lead you to bliss.  As you
enter the lobby DEEP HOUSE MUSIC will be playing for what will be a sweet
ass chill room with windows viewing a huge ice hockey arena.  The ice is
gone only the concrete floor remains for you to dance your way up to the big
stage where you will see, hear, and feel a massive sound system.  To
describe the sound in how many watts is bull shit I'll tell you it takes a
lot of power to run 8 horns, 16 12" midrange woofers, 16 18" subwoofers
stacked up high.  We will even have 4 speaker monitors for the djs to mix
their ass off with.

            All of this and more with some of the best local, regional, and
4 top notch producer/ DJ headliners.  This is sure to be the most talked
about event in years and for years to come.  So I'm saying if you are an old
school head or new school head that has ever complained about high price,
bad sound, and shitty venues then your prayers have been answered and I'll
see you here.

            This will be decorated in a luau style for the show of the year
ALOHA so bring your swimsuit and your dancing shoes for a paradise of 16
hours with banging sounds, family and friends.  Saturday August 4th 2007 for
directions call THE LINE 412 542 1717.

Much love,
BIGB

No, BUT...

You've clearly misconstrued Ed's obviously non-threatening joke and
are continuing to make a COMPLETE AND TOTAL ASS OF YOURSELF on the
list by overreacting.

Seeing as how you're the only person who DIDN'T realize he was joking
around, I figure, you want the drama, so you can have it.

After you unsub, up your dosage of Zoloft.

(This is fun...there hasn't been a good ol' fashioned flame war on
pubicle in AGES....bring me the head of Chris Nickelz!!! I demand the
teabaging of SVT to begin immediately!!! Fetch me a feral badger!!!)

Outside.

The parenthetical statement is still a part of the larger sentence.

So as you have it shown below (with the ? outside the parenthesis) is correct.

Should your comma there be a semicolon?
"...correct; no need for the comma" - ironic that your sentence itself
has no need for a comma.

p.s.
Fuck you Goose.
Fuck you! Goose.
Fuck you, Goose.
Fuck you Goose!
Fuck! You Goose!
Fuck! You. Goose!
Fuck, you Goose.

1) Strip out images from whitehouse.gov's website and replace them all
with random images from your party gallery.  Same content, and no
maintenance after it's set up.

2) Hook it up with hookers on ice photos.

3) Start a clothing line and put up an online store.  People would buy
clothes that have clever phrases on them revolving around raving.
People like t-shirts with clever phrases.  All you have to do is sit
baack and collect paychecks.  Look at the toothpastefordinner.com guy,
drew.  That guy knows what's up with taking dumb ideas and turning
them into cash.  Maybe then we could finally get some new pb-cle t's.

I take no responsibility for the grammar contained herein.  Typing on mah phone.

Worst case scenario you use cafepress like most of the other small

Subject: Re: Fwd: RE: {pb-cle} Aloha Sat. Aug. 4th

There is a lot of misplaced ego going on around here; maybe thats why 
everyone left? (They are probably listening to music and going to events 
right about now) !

^^

Is that the correct way to use that parenthesis shit? Grammar check please.

people leave the list for a lot of reasons - 10 came to mind immediately...

1) age
2) lack of interest
3) people throw parties and lose their ass because less participation (for
whatever reason)
4) rave act
5) tom cox
6) dj entropoop
7) most of the 'on topic' posts are just promotion based - so informational=
,
but not progressive talking about how to expand the pb-cle rave culture
8) vinyl vs mp3 or other drawn out technology 'discussions'
9) SVT
10) club nights are wearing thin and usually have to be a little pricy
because you have to split the cost with fewer people. They are also targete=
d
audiences (at least in pittsburgh) where there isnt a lot of variety in the
genres represented

there arent many factors driving people back onto the list...
people might meet someone from pb-cle and join the list (the ROM is the bes=
t
source of info the list offers)...

i'm just jaded though... have been for quite a few years.  i just always
keep looking around for reassurance that i've made a fair assessment...

and i sit in constant hope of a resurgence and shift back to good local
parties and the hype and vibe that I must be missing if it is occurring
under my nose?

There's also must be the class of people that join the list and leave soon
after. Additional reasons other than already mentioned:

1) Many things that a list newbie doesnt understand and probably doesn't
want to understand, leaving them feeling left out, such as badger milk,
stevie t, etc.

2) Newb realises that the vast majority of list posters don't even go to
parties unless they are somehow involved in the production of the party.

3) Annoyed at the 'sport picking' on people like stevie t and entropy, yet
annoyed at stevie t and entropy, leaves one wondering of self sanity.

4) Complete lack of on-topic posts.

5) Realise that more productive, on-topic information can be had by just
reading the ROM.

6) Find out that myspace is actually a better place to meet ravers and find
out about upcoming events.

7) Meets list regulars and realizes they are older then their mom and dad.


OK, the last one won't happen to me :P

Odd. I thought hanging out with you crusty old apathetic farts and =20
the mentally imbalanced post ratio were the reasons to stay on the list.

Speaking of crusty apathetic farts, I'm lucky to get out to have a =20
beer with anyone these days, let alone spend more than a few hours =20
out. Parenthood can be a bitch. At least the kid is going to be the =20
only 7 month old that can program a 303.

ps. Everyone knows Jesus was into tape carts. Loaves, Fishes, Grooves =20=

and Bitches.

so now we have a mission:  get out to myspace and invite as many people as
possible in the pb-cle area to join the list and start a movement (non
bowel) toward re-establishing a rave/edm ministry.  if you meet a 17 year
old listening to "Plain White T's" - hook him up with some mix cd's and
invite him to the next rave you plan to attend.  it's time to turn raves
back into the cult-like events they were designed to be.

we can start accepting donations to the "Church of pb-cle" at
plurgasm.comin addition to selling t's.

The signal to noise out there is absolutely awful. You're completely
right on the money there Ed, the only way to get people interested is
to... actually talk to people.

MW has/had the Zope portal for a while (was it mw?) which is pretty
low noise, Myspace and the rest of the Socially Retarded Networking
apps can just be damn impossible to get anything out of. I mean, there
is middleware like twitter and mugshot to deal with the fact that all
that crap is so unwieldy to use.

Maybe I need to use my brain and do something about all that.

Hello Kitty, Keeping Cops Honest

Thailand plans to shame rule-breaking police officers by making them
accessorize with that icon of ultra-girly girlhood: Hello Kitty. No matter
how minor the officers' infractions, they will be forced to wear "hot pink
armbands featuring 'Hello Kitty' ... sitting atop two hearts," reports the
Associated Press. Police Col. Pongpat Chayaphan explained that warnings no
longer do the trick, so they're bringing out the big guns of
embarrassment. "This new twist is expected to make them feel guilt and
shame and prevent them from repeating the offense, no matter how minor,"
Pongpat told the AP. "[Hello] Kitty is a cute icon for young girls. It's
not something macho police officers want covering their biceps."

The plan seems plain silly, and a sober policy analysis would be similarly
silly. But it does have an interesting cultural resonance and raises all
sorts of humorless questions: What does it mean for Thailand's female
police officers that a cartoonish symbol of femininity is used to shame
disobedient colleagues? Will this type of shaming -- which announces that
femininity is antithetical to authority and power -- discourage women from
joining the ranks of the police?

More important: Will unruly officers also be outfitted with this adorable
little handgun?

Femininity is an adult trait.  This is a kids toy.

If you made someone wear a care bears or teletubbies armband to say
"you're a fucking baby, shape up", that's motivation.  At least, if
it's introduced as a punishment, and not a special commendation.

If you wanted to say that femininity is antithetical to authority and
power, there are about seven million better ways.

That said, I can think of folks who would be commended by getting to
wear a Transformers armband, as long as they got to choose which side.
 Which, well, seems silly.  :-)

Wow, and wasn't there a thread the other day about why people don't

i much prefer the sound of three unshelled peanuts to that of 4 (or even 5)
shelled peanuts.

i became a non-man this week, i finally bought a midi controller for my
laptop (m-audio axiom 25).  when i get bored i use the usb cable to
asphyxiate myself to climax.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Tek-Know presents
3 Channels (Poland)

Touch Supper Club
2710 Lorain Ave
Cleveland, Ohio 44113

3 Channels are Deeop (Grzegorz Demianczuk) and Ketiov (Wojciech
Taranczuk). Their acquaintance began in 2003 when Ketiov started to
spin his first records in clubs like Sonar and Taras Caffe and Deeop
was already widely known for his enormous records collection and
participation in every party in the city of Stettin.

In late 2003 they organized their first mutual party at Mezzoforte
club, which appeared to be a huge success. Logically the became
resident dj's there, which gave them a chance to organize their own
parties simply named "Electronic House". The idea was to promote new
dance music completely different from what was played in most of the
polish clubs at the time. The "Electronic House" parties had the
privilege to welcome such people as: Tom Clark, Dub Taylor, John
Tejada, Antonelli Electr, Wighnomy Brothers, Todd Bodine, Matthias
Tanzmann and Duplex 100.

In September 2003 they broadcasted their first radio show called
"Session" at the local ABC Radio alongside with their old mate Vitek.
After a year "Session" evolved into the 3 Channels project. Later the
radio show was broadcasted under the name of "Plastelina" and could be
heard ever Thursday from 6 pm to 7 pm. "Plastelina" has no sound
limits and has one goal, which is to promote modern electronic music
from down tempo to electronic, tech-house or techno music.
After half a year of co-operation with Votchik 3 channels decided to
star producing... They released their 2 first records on Trenton
("Split EP" and "Superficial") then followed by 1 EP on each Trapez
and Crosstown Rebel which showed a more minimal side of their work!

All these releases showed that 3 Channels could be versatile artists
and collected a lot of good reviews all over the world on medias like
BBC or the popular Anjas Schneider's radio show "Dance Under The Blue
Moon"... They are now starting to do remixes for people such as Jacek
Sienkiewicz, Maetrik, Richard Bartz, Codec'n Flexor and are releasing
new productions on labels like Trenton, Crosstown Rebels, Trapez and
Resopal.

Sun Sep 02                          DJ T                         Pittsburgh

Thomas Koch (aka DJ T) is one of the most influential faces in dance music
today. Over the past 20 years he has held residencies at top venues from
the Frankfurt club scene such as Music Hall, Plastik, Dorian Gray, XS and
The Box; started Groove - one of Germanys biggest music magazines, and
opened the world famous club Monza in Frankfurt. All of this is well and
good, but its his work in the past five years that has really aimed the
worldwide clubbing spotlight towards him. In 2002, DJ T founded 'Get
Physical Music' along with the guys behind M.A.N.D.Y. and Booka Shade.
Since then, Get Physical has dominated DJ charts and the global press,
turning the industry upside down and single-handedly taking the
minimal/electro scene in a new direction.

Humanaut would like to invite you to an evening of upfront,
forward-thinking dance music as DJ T makes Pittsburgh (and Humanaut's 1
year anniversary party) one of only six stops in his North American tour.
The experience may just change your contact solution.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Depends on what your looking for, Pgh has had a couple parties with
hardstyle/hard trance mixes.  As far as pussy trance goes, none that I

parties since promoters always wait till the last minute.

"not grown up yet" - i graduated from case western reserve
          university in the summer of '97 and have worked 16
          years of my life already from '86 to 2002 and have  the
          social security and tax records to prove it.  ignorant
          niggas have been trying to brainwash my parents
          to believe i'm not grown up yet by falsely accusing
          me of every black gang member sin in the book
          when i was never a black gang member and had
          worked mostly fortune 500 company and  government
          jobs most of my life...the only problem i had was al
          quida jinx falsely accusing me of all his sins to cover
          up his corruption, when it was physically and  logically
          impossible for me to have commited all of jinx's sins!
          al quida jinx was the central figure behind the 420 riots
          and mastermind behind 9/11...he single handedly
          caused a trillion dollar federal defecit for america,
          mostly by tricking bush into 2 wars against 2 nations
          that have nothing to  do with 9/11 when in reality,
          al quida jinx was behind 9/11 as a huge insurance
          scam, which unfortunately cost 2,793 people their
          lives in NY on 9/11 and causing  $40 billion dollars
          loss of life, loss of property, and loss of business!...al
          quida jinx has gotten away with genocide, because
          columbus FBI agent mike nees takes bribes from
          black gang members not to go after them, but instead    
          frame sons of republicans like myself for their  sins!...
          mike nees is a worse traitor than robert hansen ever
          was, because hansen's corruption never caused the
          death of 2,793 people in NY on 9/11!

           altho i do think idiots on TV publically confessing they
           have fantasies of me beating it all the time *is* gay. too
           bad, it costs them a $1000 FCC violation fine each time
           they make the same 'gay'  mistake.

"korean" - i am not korean.   obviously africans want to lable all
           asians as koreans to piss off japan and china to get them
            to sell t. bonds to bankrupt the federal reserve to bankrupt
            america.  they don't have to anymore, because bush almost
            got suckered by africa to give the remaining $30 billion to
            africa.  once the federal reserve is bankrupt, america is

            quantities.  the ones that survive get shot by niggas in drive-by
            shootings when they get back home!  i am actually 4th
            generation chinese american.  my great grand parents were
            around when the chinese built the transcontinental railroad,
            my grand father was around when the chinese theatre   was
            built in 1927.  my father is reagan era republican.  and i am
            the international intelligence director and owner of the federal
            government as well as the state government of california.

"yoshi" - there is no yoshi on any FBI most wanted list, mostly
             because Japan is the single largest in the federal government
             with $720.8 billion invested in US treasury bonds where FBI
             pay check money comes from.  'yoshi' is a cartoon character

             equivalent of calling me "mickey mouse".

'in jail' - i actually live in a half million dollar house with a pool in the
            back, 3 car garage, in a predominantly republican / military
            neighborhood.

'broke' - altho it is true i have not been paid for 4 years now due  to
            extreme defamation of character, slander, and loss of wages
            due to blacks falsely accusing me of every black sin in the
            book from OJ's wife killing to Kobe's rape allegations  to
            Michael Jackson child molestation to Clarence Thomas's
            sexual offenses to Oprah's weight problem, i am not broke.
            i do have savings from mostly christmas and b-day checks.
            in addition, Bush owes me $140 billion for acquiring $1.4
            trillion from  Japan and China to bail america out of a trillion
            dollar federal defecit, giving america a $400 billion dollar
            budget.  unfortunately, bush spent $200 billion on   katrina,
            afghanistan and iraq.  bush spent $124 billion to continue
            the war on iraq.  and bush spent $48 billion on a dem
            requested global warming agenda so dems would not
            filibuster his $124 billion dollar war on iraq bill.

"drug dealer" - i have never been a drug dealer.  i don't even smoke
             cigarettes. you can check my social security statements,
             i worked from 1986 to 2002.  i worked mostly fortune 500
             company jobs and government jobs...my last job in  ohio
             was a federal government job where i  got people jobs in
             government, military, fortune 500 companies, and various
             healthcare organizations...it was a job one could only get
             by passing a drug test, two interviews, and having government
             connections.

"DUI" - check my  records, i have never had a DUI.  last time i was           pulled over for a DUI check, but i passed with flying colors\u003cbr\>           since i hadn't even made it to the bar yet. \n unfortunately,\u003cbr\>           i had two outstanding parking tickets, so they impounded\u003cbr\>           my car.  turned out they were two illegal parking tickets,\u003cbr\>           because it was for the same parking ticket twice and it was\u003cbr\>           for a parking ticket parked in front of my apartment...you\u003cbr\>           can't give someone a parking ticket parked in front of your\u003cbr\>           own apartment...finally, the city of columbus confessed\u003cbr\>           they over ticketed due to city defecit problems!\u003cbr\>\u003cbr\>"rehab" - i have never been to rehab because i never had a drug\n or\u003cbr\>             alcohol problem.\u003cbr\>\u003cbr\>"mental patient" - i am obviously  not crazy especially since i am\u003cbr\>

           pulled over for a DUI check, but i passed with flying colors
           since i hadn't even made it to the bar yet.   unfortunately,
           i had two outstanding parking tickets, so they impounded
           my car.  turned out they were two illegal parking tickets,
            because it was for the same parking ticket twice and it was
           for a parking ticket parked in front of my apartment...you
           can't give someone a parking ticket parked in front of your
           own apartment...finally, the city of columbus confessed
           they over ticketed due to city defecit problems!

"rehab" - i have never been to rehab because i never had a drug  or
             alcohol problem.

"mental patient" - i am obviously not crazy especially since i am
             a registered republican and have worked mostly fortune
              500 company and government jobs most of my life....but
             corrupt doctors did mis-diagnose me for a health insurance
             scam when they found out i had health insurance...this is
             why universal healthcare needs to be veto'ed, it is a scam,
             it is a way for doctors, to make enormous amounts  of
             money by mis-disgnosing patients for health insurance
             scams!

"neo" - neo is a character from the movie the matrix, a purely
            fictional fantasy movie that uses mostly  computer CGI
            special effects.  obviously women can not freeze in
            mid air while performing a crane kick, people can't
            dodge bullets, and people can't jump off buildings
            and survive.  that is all hollywood movie magic.  movies
             can not be used in a court of law as credible evidence,
            because they tend to be highly contrived and easily
            manipulated.

"no friends" - obviously since i was part of the pre-Y2K intelligence            team for the  state of ohio in 1998. i networked the networks.\u003cbr\>            i made computer moguls into billionaires.  my internet reports\u003cbr\>            have inpired over 2 dozen movies and 2 dozen TV shows that\u003cbr\>            have made celebrities into millionaires.  in addition, i started\u003cbr\>            the underground scene in ohio in 1984.\n china club was\u003cbr\>            started in 1985 in NY starting many clubs on the east coast,\u003cbr\>            the east coast rapture.  my people built the chinese theatre\u003cbr\>            in hollywood, california in 1927 starting the west coast rapture.\u003cbr\>            i was in ZBT fraternity while in college.

don't believe the hype!...especially not from dark tares who are professional
haters who hated so much, they were responsible for 9/11!...always remember,
black hate caused 9/11!...but  they got away with genocide by framing bin
laden with doctored videos!

    MEN IN BLACK - In present-day America, Tommy Lee Jones plays
    Agent K, a member of an organization that has been keeping track
    of extra-terrestrial aliens on Earth for over 40 years. When K finds
    himself in need of a new partner, a brash NYPD detective, James
    Edwards (Will Smith) fills the position, becoming Agent J. Armed with
    space-age technology (which J barely understands) and their razor-
    sharp wits, J and K investigate a newcomer (played by Vincent
    D'Onofrio) who is bad news for Earth...tommy lee, who just happened
    to be al gore's roommate when he was in college joins forces with
    will smith (house party fame), an actor who had been cast to play
    walt smith (collective intelligence, another party kid from cleveland,
    ohio that i helped start) parts before...Democrats and the CIA had
    always been suspect of alien technology ever since my post about
    Area 51 and Hanger 18, located at Wright Patterson Air Force in
    Dayton, Ohio - also the home of Alien Workshop skater gear...The
    constellation orion is actually what the lay out of the egyptian
    pyramids form, it also where the pleidians are from aka the Family
    of Light, the good aliens as opposed to the evil grays.

    ROMEO MUST DIE - In this modern day Romeo and Juliet, kung fu
    action star Jet Li plays Romeo to hip-hop singer, Aaliyah Haughton's
    Juliet. Li is an ex-cop investigating the murder of his brother, who
    had ties with the Chinese mafia in America. Aaliyah plays the
    daughter of the American mob boss. Neither side approves of their
    romance, so, obviously, kung fu action ensues, with a soundtrack by
    Aaliyah...obviously i represent modern day romeo and layla modern
    day juliet...i call layla a nazi and she is obsessed with her "dont be
    like jews", "keep the jews whipped" brainwashing...hopefully, this
    love story will not have a tragic ending

    MINORITY REPORT - Based on a Philip K. Dick short story, Minority
    Report is about a cop in the future working in a division of the police
    department that arrests killers before they commit the crimes courtesy
    of some future viewing technology. Cruise's character has the tables
    turned on him when he is accused of a future crime and must find out
    what brought it about and stop it before it can happen...obviously
    i had been doing some law enforcement investigations when i find
    out that i had been framed for the murder of layla and end up
    being the one investigated...so i send watch logs proving that she
    is still alive to the other agencies

    THE ONE- in the near future, a technology called "quantum tunneling"
    will allow human beings to travel between parallel universes. The abuse
    of this ability by criminal elements has led to the formation of the Multi-
    Verse Authorities or "MVA," an agency of quantum traveling cops who
    apprehend violators of inter-dimensional laws...this movie was used to
    explain my odd ability to communicate with people in various motion
    pictures in real time despite the fact that film is pre-recorded material
    and even inspire new movies in real time

    THE NEGOTIATOR - In the midst of an elaborate conspiracy, an expert
    negotiator is driven to the edge when he's framed for the murder of his
    partner, as well as embezzling money from his department's pension fund.
    His only chance to prove his innocence is to take hostages himself, acquire
    the services of another expert negotiator, and find out who's running the
    conspiracy before it's too late...another movie depicting how i had been
    framed to have murdered layla as well as embezzling money from the
    FBI and CIA (double agent), when in reality my pay checks have been
    held back due to the frame job, eventhough i had been sending in
    intelligence reports since 1998...apparently some of my e-mails had
    been intercepted and made into movies...i am still awaiting my royalties
    for the movies that i had inspired as well.

    MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE - Captain Bennett Marco (Washington) and
    Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Schreiber) served together during the Persian Gulf
    War (the first one), and were part of a platoon of U.S. soldiers who were
    kidnapped by the enemy, and brainwashed to become pawns once they
    return home. Now, ten years later, Raymond Shaw is climbing the political
    ladder, as his mother's (Streep) new husband is a powerful senator
    helping a presidential candidate. Marco, however, is not dealing with the
    adjustment after the war as well, and eventually remembers being
    brainwashed. Knowing that it's just a matter of time before Shaw is called
    to service by his handler, Marco contacts Shaw to try to get through to
    him before something terrible happens...obviously washington plays
    john muhammed, who was brainwashed to commit the baltimore sniper
    shootings...of course, i am the real manchurian candidate, i have the
    ability to head this nation, but i am being brainwashed to be an immigrant
    gang member because i am not white.

    PI - darren aronofsky's movie about a genius who locks himself up in his
    apartment spends hours in front of computers to find the mathematical
    significance of god' real name...eventually the realization overwhelms him,
    and he ends up picking a hole in his head to forget and befriends a little girl.
    ...unable to physically lead the nation because i am not white, i am
    confined to my room, solving world problems on my computer, sending
    my intelligence reports from california to DC, hoping the reports do not
    get intercepted by the nazi's who have alterior motives - war plans to
    conquer the world...a li'l mormon girl sent to investigate me has learned
    the truth and has become my distant friend.

    THE OMEGA CODE - Ancient codes hidden within the Torah reveals the
    secrets of global events, past (i.e. Hitler, the Kennedy assasination, the
    Gulf War), present, and future. One man (York) is after the Code, seeking
    the power to change the world as we know it...for the worse. Another
    (Van Dien) seeks the truth, risking his life and everything he stands for in
    order to stop him...i was the one who posted about the bible code since
    2000...i just recently posted the bible code warning that there may be
    major earthquakes coming up in california and to prepare for things by
    training a natural disaster division of homeland security

    BEAUTIFUL MIND - A biopic of the meteoric rise of John Forbes Nash Jr.,
    a math prodigy able to solve problems that baffled the greatest of minds.
    And how he overcame years of suffering through schizophrenia to win the
    Nobel Prize...the movie that they made that scientists all around the
    world have learned about my intelligence reports despite the nazi's
    trying to frame me as a schizophrenic and have unnoficially awarded
    me the noble prize

    SECRET WINDOW - Mort Rainey (Depp), a writer just coming off of a
    troublesome divorce with his ex-wife, Amy (Bello), finds himself stalked
    at his remote lake house by a psychotic stranger (Turturro) who claims
    Mort stole his best story idea (changing just the ending)... (Hutton plays
    Bello's new boyfriend; Dutton plays a private investigator hired to make
    Turturro's character leave Mort alone.)...hollywood screen writers
    message that they do not believe they had plagiarized their stories
    from me, because they do not want to pay me royalties

    BIG - A young boy makes a wish at a fairground machine to be big.
    He wakes up the following morning to find that his wish has been

    with the unfamiliar world of grown ups including getting a job, and
    having his first romantic encounter with a woman. What will he find
    out about this strange world?...movie to get people to become born
    again virgins, forget their past, because you can't change the past,
    and start a new life by seeking a new job and romance

    FORREST GUMP - The story follows the life of low I.Q. Forrest Gump
    (Tom Hanks) and his meeting with the love of his life Jenny. The film
    chronicles his accidental experiences with some of the most important
    people and events in America from the late 1950's through the 1970's
    including a meeting with Elvis Presley, JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Richard
    Nixon, fighting in Vietnam, etc. The problem is, he's too stupid to realize
    the significance of his actions. Forrest becomes representative of the
    baby boomer generation having walked through life blindly...obviously
    i have had a tremendous influence in modern day events even events
    in the past, despite the fact that most people see me as inept forest
    gump character that accidentally effects major events, movies, and
    tv shows.

    SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE - Sam is a recent widower who is seeking
    someone new. Sam's son Jonah, is also looking for a new mother,
    so when Jonah puts his father on national radio, hundreds of women
    write to him. One of the women is Annie. She's engaged to Walter,
    but he's a bit strange. Annie goes to great lengths to meet Sam....
    this movie perfectly depicts my long distance relationship with
    layla and mary...jonah is symbolism for three days in the belly
    of the whale

    YOU GOT MAIL - The owner of a large bookstore chain starts putting
    the owner of a small local bookstore out of business. Meanwhile they
    have been corresponding over the internet without knowing who either

    internet they are very attracted. He finds out who she is but she
    doesn't know. He starts to like her more but she still hates him. He
    has to fix it....obviously another movie perfectly depicting my internet
    relationship with layla...we couldn't stand each other when we lived
    together before...i start to love her more over the internet, but she
    still hates me, so i like all the world problems i had to deal with before,
    have to solve the most complex problem known to mankind since
    adam and eve - women, you can't live with them, you can't live without
    them

    THE GIRL OF YOUR DREAMS - Post-Franco filmmaker Fernando Trueba's
    first Spanish-based feature since 1993's Oscar-winning Belle Epoque, La
    Nina de Tus Ojos begins in 1938, when Spain is torn by Civil War. As a
    sign of cordiality between General Franco and Adolph Hitler, a Spanish film
    crew is invited to Nazi Germany's UFA Studios in Berlin to make two versions
    of a popular Andalusian musical. The cast includes sexy, golden-hearted
    Macarena (Penélope Cruz), director Blas Fontiveros (Antonio Resines),
    leading man Julian Torralba (Jorge Sanz), art director Castillo (Santiago
    Segura) and alcoholic Rosa Rosales (Rosa Maria Sarda). On arrival, they
    gape at the resplendent shooting facilities, thankful to escape the misery
    of their war-torn country. However, it is not long before they realize what
    they have got themselves into, particularly when Nazi propaganda minister
    Josef Goebbels (Johannes Silberschneider) falls for the Latina charms of
    Macarena. German actress of Fassbinder fame Hanna Schygulla makes a
    cameo appearance as the wizened wife of the lustful propaganda minister
    ...ironically i had wanted to cast penelope cruz for my lady guadelupe
    movie idea, to give mexican americans a better image than as immigrants
    and gangsters...the movie also correlates to republican gov. arnold's
    relationship with his wife maria shriver kennedy, who comes from a strong
    democratic family...cruz bustamante is also california's lieutenant governor,
    who also happens to be democrat.

    FIFTH ELEMENT - Two hundred and fifty years in the future, life as we know
    it is threatened by the arrival of Evil. Only the fifth element (played by Milla
    Jovovich) can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every
    five thousand years. She is helped by ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Corben
    Dallas (played by Bruce Willis), who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio
    clone, Ruby Rhod. Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg (Gary
    Oldman), who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his alien
    mercenaries...when i was in columbus, i was often percieved as a cab driver,
    giving rachael rides...after arriving to calfornia and solving so many world
    problems and assisting with the cyber-division of homeland security, i am
    given a travel bonus - for four people to anywhere in america including
    hawaii and the bahamas...my mother doesn't get it and constantly nags me
    ...all of a sudden jinx is back as the irritating pain in the ass commentator
    through out my ordeal...apparently something evil coming toward earth and
    i need to find the perfect woman so that our love can be the fifth element to
    stop the evil before it hits earth.

    THX1138 - George Lucas adapted this, his first film, from a short he
    made at University. THX 1138, LUH 3417, and SEN 5241 attempt to
    escape from a futuristic society located beneath the surface of the
    Earth. The society has outlawed sex, with drugs used to control the
    people. THX 1138 stops taking the drugs, and gets LUH 3417 pregnant.
    They are both thrown in jail where they meet SEN 5241 and start to
    plan their escape...the first has become the last...as i am actually one
    of the closest bloodlines to adam, i have become the last adam...i am
    considered 'underground' because i'm no longer in the matrix...the
    mormons have chastened me by spreading false rumors of 'gang rape'
    about me...i have stopped taking drugs for some time now...somehow
    as if by immaculate conception, i have gotten my soulmate pregnant...
    our isolation from the rest of society through the use of deceptive nazi
    propagnda seems like a modern prison within our own homes...and we
    must find a way to escape, so we can be together again.

<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MEN IN BLACK - In present-day America, Tommy Lee Jones plays<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agent K, a member of an organization that has been keeping track<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of extra-terrestrial aliens on Earth for over 40 years. When K finds<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; himself in need of a new partner, a brash NYPD detective, James<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwards (Will Smith) fills the position, becoming Agent J. Armed with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; space-age technology (which J barely understands) and their razor-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sharp wits, J and K investigate a newcomer (played by Vincent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D'Onofrio) who is bad news for Earth...tommy lee, who just happened<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be al gore's roommate when he was in college joins forces with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will smith (house party fame), an actor who had been cast to play<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walt smith (collective intelligence, another party kid from
 cleveland,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ohio that i helped start) parts before...Democrats and the CIA had<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always been suspect of alien technology ever since my post about<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Area 51 and Hanger 18, located at Wright Patterson Air Force in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dayton, Ohio - also the home of Alien Workshop skater gear...The<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constellation orion is actually what the lay out of the egyptian<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pyramids form, it also where the pleidians are from aka the Family<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Light, the good aliens as opposed to the evil grays.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROMEO MUST DIE - In this modern day Romeo and Juliet, kung fu<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; action star Jet Li plays Romeo to hip-hop singer, Aaliyah Haughton's<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Juliet. Li is an ex-cop investigating the murder of his brother, who<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had ties with the Chinese mafia in America. Aaliyah plays
 the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daughter of the American mob boss. Neither side approves of their<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; romance, so, obviously, kung fu action ensues, with a soundtrack by<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaliyah...obviously i represent modern day romeo and layla modern<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day juliet...i call layla a nazi and she is obsessed with her "dont be<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like jews", "keep the jews whipped" brainwashing...hopefully, this<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love story will not have a tragic ending<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINORITY REPORT - Based on a Philip K. Dick short story, Minority<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Report is about a cop in the future working in a division of the police<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; department that arrests killers before they commit the crimes courtesy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of some future viewing technology. Cruise's character has the tables<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned on him when he is accused of a future crime and must find
 out<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what brought it about and stop it before it can happen...obviously<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i had been doing some law enforcement investigations when i find<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out that i had been framed for the murder of layla and end up<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being the one investigated...so i send watch logs proving that she<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is still alive to the other agencies<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE ONE- in the near future, a technology called "quantum tunneling"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will allow human beings to travel between parallel universes. The abuse<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of this ability by criminal elements has led to the formation of the Multi-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verse Authorities or "MVA," an agency of quantum traveling cops who<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apprehend violators of inter-dimensional laws...this movie was used to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explain my odd ability to communicate with people in various
 motion<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures in real time despite the fact that film is pre-recorded material<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and even inspire new movies in real time<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE NEGOTIATOR - In the midst of an elaborate conspiracy, an expert<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; negotiator is driven to the edge when he's framed for the murder of his<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; partner, as well as embezzling money from his department's pension fund.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His only chance to prove his innocence is to take hostages himself, acquire<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the services of another expert negotiator, and find out who's running the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conspiracy before it's too late...another movie depicting how i had been<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; framed to have murdered layla as well as embezzling money from the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FBI and CIA (double agent), when in reality my pay checks have been<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; held back due to the frame job, eventhough i had
 been sending in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence reports since 1998...apparently some of my e-mails had<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been intercepted and made into movies...i am still awaiting my royalties<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the movies that i had inspired as well.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE - Captain Bennett Marco (Washington) and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Schreiber) served together during the Persian Gulf<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War (the first one), and were part of a platoon of U.S. soldiers who were<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kidnapped by the enemy, and brainwashed to become pawns once they<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return home. Now, ten years later, Raymond Shaw is climbing the political<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ladder, as his mother's (Streep) new husband is a powerful senator<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; helping a presidential candidate. Marco, however, is not dealing with the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adjustment after the war as well, and eventually
 remembers being<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brainwashed. Knowing that it's just a matter of time before Shaw is called<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to service by his handler, Marco contacts Shaw to try to get through to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him before something terrible happens...obviously washington plays<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; john muhammed, who was brainwashed to commit the baltimore sniper<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shootings...of course, i am the real manchurian candidate, i have the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ability to head this nation, but i am being brainwashed to be an immigrant<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gang member because i am not white.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PI - darren aronofsky's movie about a genius who locks himself up in his<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apartment spends hours in front of computers to find the mathematical<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; significance of god' real name...eventually the realization overwhelms him,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he ends up picking a hole in his head to

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sun Sep 02                          DJ T                         Pittsburgh

Thomas Koch (aka DJ T) is one of the most influential faces in dance music
today. Over the past 20 years he has held residencies at top venues from
the Frankfurt club scene such as Music Hall, Plastik, Dorian Gray, XS and
The Box; started Groove - one of Germanys biggest music magazines, and
opened the world famous club Monza in Frankfurt. All of this is well and
good, but its his work in the past five years that has really aimed the
worldwide clubbing spotlight towards him. In 2002, DJ T founded 'Get
Physical Music' along with the guys behind M.A.N.D.Y. and Booka Shade.
Since then, Get Physical has dominated DJ charts and the global press,
turning the industry upside down and single-handedly taking the
minimal/electro scene in a new direction.

Humanaut would like to invite you to an evening of upfront,
forward-thinking dance music as DJ T makes Pittsburgh (and Humanaut's 1
year anniversary party) one of only six stops in his North American tour.
The experience may just change your contact solution.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

These guys are talented, spin some great music, and are down with the 
program to bring together a killer club night without a fifteen dollar 
cover. Moonshine will have a $5.00 cover ($8.00 for ages 18-20). We will 
bring in guest DJs. We will bring in special acts. We will try our 
damndest to do it all without raising the cover charge.

Subject: {pb-cle} attn windows geeks: help?

OK, i got a new job and i'm needing to use my work computer as a 
gateway for my notebook.  This is simple enough in windows, but I'd 
also like to remote desktop into my notebook from the desktop as I do 
at home.

Do you think this would be possible with one of these USB ethernet 
adapters on the "gateway" computer?

thanks

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} attn windows geeks: help?

sounds like you want to setup internet connection sharing on your 
desktop, and use remote desktop to get to the laptop?

yeah, you can do that with a USB enet adaptor.

So first off, I finally got around to doing something worthwhile with my
domain, I started blogging.

*ugh*  I know... another blog.

http://www.thehotshit.com

but mine's got a catchy and easy to remember name, so the rest of you
subtlereference.blogspot.com fockers can bite my crank - it's the hot shit.

Anyways, to the subject at hand... I got M.I.A.'s new album, Kala, today
after anxiously waiting for it to come out after "Arular" was fabulous 2
years ago... so i decided to give a mini-review of it - in a brief, track by
track play-by-play - on my blog.

I would love to get a hold of some of the acapella's from this.  or if
anyone has heard any of the bonus tracks on the japanese release?

if you want, you can always sign up for my RSS feed
http://www.thehotshit.com/atom.xml

and if you know of anything you would consider to be "the hot shit," feel
free to pass it along my way.

Yeah, but my site is all minimalistic and fully xhtml strict/css compliant.

http://vrillusions.com/

no blog (yet) but it has an "excuse the dust" heading.  All I need is a
pixelated "under construction" animated gif placed in several spots
throughout the page and I'd be all set.  Ohh ohh and the contact page
uses recaptcha to prevent spam and also helps by reading books.  And it
will use openid if I ever have anything that needs logins.  And it has
iphone backgrounds...  Yeah, I still have a lot of work to do on it.

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sun Sep 02                          DJ T                         Pittsburgh

Thomas Koch (aka DJ T) is one of the most influential faces in dance music
today. Over the past 20 years he has held residencies at top venues from
the Frankfurt club scene such as Music Hall, Plastik, Dorian Gray, XS and
The Box; started Groove - one of Germanys biggest music magazines, and
opened the world famous club Monza in Frankfurt. All of this is well and
good, but its his work in the past five years that has really aimed the
worldwide clubbing spotlight towards him. In 2002, DJ T founded 'Get
Physical Music' along with the guys behind M.A.N.D.Y. and Booka Shade.
Since then, Get Physical has dominated DJ charts and the global press,
turning the industry upside down and single-handedly taking the
minimal/electro scene in a new direction.

Humanaut would like to invite you to an evening of upfront,
forward-thinking dance music as DJ T makes Pittsburgh (and Humanaut's 1
year anniversary party) one of only six stops in his North American tour.
The experience may just change your contact solution.

Data Panic presents

A special live performance by Popnoname (Kompakt, Italic)  Germany
www.popnoname.de

w/ live guitar and vocals! This is guaranteed to be an amazing show!

POPNONAME is 28-year-old artist and musician Jens-Uwe Beyer. Five years 
ago, he moved from the little German island of Fehmarn to Cologne, began 
composing scores for theatre and film and started his career by 
producing electronic club music. Over the last couple of years, 
POPNONAME has regularly contributed to KOMPAKT's Pop Ambient series, has 
released numerous maxi-singles on Cologne-based labels FIRM and ITALIC, 
and has just released his first full-length album. POPNONAME is now 
considered to be one of the most glamorous artists in Cologne's new 
music scene.

His releases receive a great deal of attention in both the international 
music press and in DJ reviews. His records are already played by most 
respected DJs such as JAMES HOLDEN or JOHN DIGWEED and have received a 
lot of positive feedback from the internet radio community LAST FM. The 
Swedish DIGFI magazine writes: "POPNONAME is actually the "Jack Kerouac" 
of Cologne Techno and he is a real sensation!"

*featuring the return of Houston's Jessica Partin 
(www.jessicapartin.com) spinning a special tag team opening/closing set 
with Cleveland's John K (Tek-know / Touch).

Thu Sep 27                         KASKADE                         Columbus

www.kaskademusic.com
View e-flyer and sample CD at: www.ultrarecords.com/ECards/Kaskade
Bring the Night is the latest mix album by house DJ/producer Kaskade. 
Released on Ultra Records, Bring the Night is crafted to give unwavering 
house heads what they want most in a mix album: it delivers on the party 
front and drops the big room jams. And true to Kaskade styleand what 
differentiates this artist from others in dance musicBring the Night 
also manages to serve up those trademark melodies and sensual vocals.
But more than anything, this is 115 minutes of feel good body rock. 
"With my artist albums, I'm conveying emotion, I'm constructing beats 
and writing songs that represent me as an artist and a person, so it 
doesn't necessarily come out as 'dance heavy,'" says Kaskade. "But a mix 
CD is about walking the line, and fitting my style in with the DJ side 
of things. Yeah, I want to keep it musical and fresh, but Bring the 
Night is intentionally produced very rhythmic andwell, banging. This is 
a head bobbing mix, something to pop in your car and thump."
And with 15 hard-hitting tracks, including Dance Chart topping Kaskade 
remixes of Nelly Furtado's "All Good Things (Come To An End)", and 
Floetry's "SupaStar," Bring the Night achieves just thatit's a non-stop, 
seamless stream of orchestrated beats and flavor, all with a nod to the 
night life.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Begin the mp3 vs vinyl debate :)

Interesting idea though that your brain is spending more time "filling
in the gaps" that you can't "experience" the songs as much.  Not sure
how much I buy into it, but YMMV

Heard this mentioned on a This Week in Tech podcast and one of the guys
said the dynamic range nowadays is only around 3db, which seemed really
off but I did some searching around and that's apparently the case.
that the most recent cds only have a dynamic range of 3db

i've consciously thought about the dynamic range thing, not only on audio,
but also on television shows and even cinema.

i guess it's all to let people not miss anything (but that's why there is
tivo, right?)

"Producers saying MP3 audio quality sucks (and so do CDs)"

This almost mirrors the discussion about audio tape vs reading and
which "engages" the senses more. Honestly while they do both behave
slightly differently psychoaccoustically I think by making the mind do
the gap filling you are actually potentially experiencing the song
even MORE because you mind MUST follow with it and consume it more
completely and deeper. I avoid these discussions for the most part
because the actual relevance I believe is in the .05% range. A more
worthwhile discussion is the over compression of music on CD and in
general to win the volume war of the juke box, that has a much larger
more immediate impact on the general quality of music in the world
than some abstract, edgy, heady discussion about almost unmeasurable
differences in quality in one format vs the other.

> Bring the Night is the latest mix album by house DJ/producer Kaskade.
> Released on Ultra Records, Bring the Night is crafted to give unwavering
> house heads what they want most in a mix album: it delivers on the party
> front and drops the big room jams. And true to Kaskade styleand what
> differentiates this artist from others in dance musicBring the Night
> also manages to serve up those trademark melodies and sensual vocals.
> But more than anything, this is 115 minutes of feel good body rock.
> "With my artist albums, I'm conveying emotion, I'm constructing beats
> and writing songs that represent me as an artist and a person, so it
> doesn't necessarily come out as 'dance heavy,'" says Kaskade. "But a mix
> CD is about walking the line, and fitting my style in with the DJ side
> of things. Yeah, I want to keep it musical and fresh, but Bring the
> Night is intentionally produced very rhythmic andwell, banging. This is
> a head bobbing mix, something to pop in your car and thump."
> And with 15 hard-hitting tracks, including Dance Chart topping Kaskade
> remixes of Nelly Furtado's "All Good Things (Come To An End)", and
> Floetry's "SupaStar," Bring the Night achieves just thatit's a non-stop,
> seamless stream of orchestrated beats and flavor, all with a nod to the
> night life.

> www.hulla.info
>
> The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th,
> 2008.
>
> It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the
> party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to
> seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future
> reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really
> nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla
> Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.
>
> The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party,
> attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let
> people start making their plans now since there could be significant
> investment by some in getting here.
>
> More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008,
> but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve
> come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.
>
>
>
> Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.
>
> - $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you
> pay nothing)
> - Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular
> availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
> - 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not
> including OMGH or DVD).
> - Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event
> news
> - You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes
> public (expected Feburary 2008).
>
> The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase
> when they go on sale.
>
>
> There.s also some more free bonuses:
>
> If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD
> you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):
>
> Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for
> a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete
> pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This
> set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!
>
> Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last
> ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm
> together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!
>
> Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them.
> They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend
> Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.
>
>
> Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this
> offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out
> next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will
> cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before
> they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's
> date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll
> also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t
> falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even
> faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some
> breathing room.
>
> Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the
> HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and
> Hulla DVDs

I saw that article not too long ago on some music blog, and I was
screaming "bullshit" until about halfway through....

remember those clunky ass mono record players in grade school?
remember single speaker transistor radios?
remember any portable music device that pre-dates the walkman?

garbage in, garbage out.

"If the power of the narrative of the movie isn't there," he says
metaphorically, "there's only so far cinematography can take you."

dynamic range doesn't mean shit without emotional range.

There aren't any gaps in digital audio, though; speakers don't produce
digital noises, they produce analog vibrations.

If someone sets the highpass frequency of music too high, yeah, you're
losing important data.  I think the shitty reputation most MP3s get is
due to bitrates that are unnecessarily low, and highpass that's
unnecessarily high.

But we still don't see a market for FLAC.

This was the latest article to come accross my inbox.  I've been seeing =
a LOT of them lately.

because they have two songs with artwork for less than the cost of a =
download?  My most favorite track in the record bag this week was =
released as a 45 with no digital release offered.  45 only.

I would place bets that by the end of the first quarter of 2008 you will =
start to see a new twist on what succesfull record labels already know:  =
In-home marketing of music that was intended to entertain people who =
like to leave their house defeats the purpose and limits exposure.  I =
would expect American labels to stay pretty much the same, since they =
will buy them accross the pond where in many places you aren't taken =
seriously if you play files.  Also, American labels offer more bang for =
the buck -- $8 will get you 3-4 tracks and most of the time they are all =
solid.  I expect that uk/german labels will start offering a free =
download with the purchase of a vinyl copy - and the vinyl copy will =
arrive 3-6 months before the digital copy.=20

As far as the sound quality goes, yeah vinyl sounds better - but it is =
all in the equipment AND the pressing.  Screw the kids that play their =
crappy mp3s they found on p2p sites though - everyone should be making =
sure those people get shot especially if they are getting paid.  =
Promoters shouldn't be booking them.  Until dance music is the number 1 =
genre of music in the world, those people are stealing from the =
underground.  At least people who spin wax can't ever be confused for =
one of those types.

  I saw that article not too long ago on some music blog, and I was
  screaming "bullshit" until about halfway through....

  remember those clunky ass mono record players in grade school?
  remember single speaker transistor radios?
  remember any portable music device that pre-dates the walkman?

  garbage in, garbage out.

  "If the power of the narrative of the movie isn't there," he says
  metaphorically, "there's only so far cinematography can take you."

  dynamic range doesn't mean shit without emotional range.

Not sure if it was hear, but yeah I read somewhere that cd's are going
out of phase and vinyl is starting to be "the hot shit"(.com) again.  So
all these emo bands are starting to put out records now/again.

Def Agree with that.  Downloading one just so you can verify it's the
right song that you want is one thing, but then going out and playing it
is another story.  Was at some party in cleveland (so you know it was a
while ago) and one of the guys you could obviously tell was playing
bootlegged music that sounded like they were honestly encoded at 96kbps
mp3s it was awful.

i cant remember a point in time where i couldnt get any punk music that i
was interested in on either 7", 10" or 12"...

i'm still a strong believer in a large parallel between punk and edm phases
of popularity / slide from popularity... unfortunately the trend for
hipsters to listen to johnny cash 24/7 had pulled away from the popularity
of punk and edm... until now.  i see a small comeback in some growth in the
alt punk interest as well as edm, probably accounting for the increase in
vinyl.

that and you always know that there is a resurgence in electronic music when
a certain person starts forwarding AIM conversations... you can only
attribute a global increase in vinyl sales to a sav-E-Or 104 less than 420.
whirled solution #72487.

Since im short on time I will just cutnpaste a comment I left on CDM
recently on the same topic.
http://createdigitalmusic.com/2007/08/15/mp3-music-no-longer-connected-to-your-brain/#comments


"I personally love FLAC and adopted it as a download option for
experimedia releases years ago. We even have a little FLAC FAQ we put
together for those who download our free releases. Everytime I
purchase a new album I rip it to FLAC, burn to a CD-R, and keep my
original tucked away on the shelf and the CD-R in my car. Then
archiving the FLAC and original retail CD in case my CD-R copies ever
get scratched. Pretty much the only time I pull out the original CD is
for home use or to read the liner notes.
Now I just want to see edirol add FLAC playback (or even recording)
support for their R-09 recorder so it can act as my portable media
player as well.
Been thinking about getting one of the COWON digital media players
that support FLAC at some point.
But yes I agree. I really hope to see FLAC get adopted more widely as
bandwidth and diskspace increases."

I admit I used to use P2P allot (soulseek) but only to keep my 24/7
pirate FM radio station in Canton stocked with new music to promote.

These days I either hit up Bent Crayon for the physical or hit
Bleep.com or boomkat.com if I just want a single track off a release.
Many releases on bleep.com are available as flac.  Plus I listen to
allot of netlabel stuff.

I just signed experimedia's new physical commercial cd catalog up for
digital distribution through theorchard.com who is going to distribute
our releases to everything from itunes to beatport and between.

Thanks to digg this just got people's attention all of a sudden:

http://digg.com/gadgets/Audiophiles_vs_the_iPod_the_battle_over_loudness

Every so often people actually have good comments.  One guy links to a
youtube video that pretty much explains things for those that have no
idea what all this loudness and dynamic range stuff mean.  Ironically
the volume of the voice over is pretty quiet

I spent the better part of a year setting up something called digital  
simulcast -- if you have a digital cable box, you get your channels  
that are normally analog as digital channels, but you can still just  
plug in an RF cable into your TV and that works normally.

Why?

A few reasons, but mostly because digital transport is less resistant  
to the problems that analog signals are. While the digital signal may  
be degraded from the analog one (oh, and boy is it), when it comes to  
issues of signal ingress and whatnot, it's better to be digital. If  
you have crappy splitters or wiring in your home, you're much better  
off with the digital signal than the analog one -- although the  
analog signal, when it's up to par, is far superior to the digital one.

With that concept in mind, would I rather have a quality record or a  
digital replica? Does it matter if I'm watching/listening for  
informational purposes or catching up on a tv series on my laptop  
while on the go? What if I'm enjoying a movie in my home?

What is the bandwidth of a crate of records? If an analog TV signal  
is better than a digital one, would you rather trade 400 channels for  
28 analog ones? How much does the mechanical media really matter when  
you're playing it through a fisher price setup? How much does the  
mechanical media matter when you have a $50,000 setup?

Truth be told, there's a real need for records, flac files, shitty  
96kbit mp3's, film, VHS, h264 videos, and reel to reel. You can argue  
all day about vinyl vs digital, but the real argument is how what  
fits what situation, and that is extremely debatable.

The asinine part is mechanical licenses -- the powers that be want  
you to pay for a DVD, blu-ray, digital download, and UMD. Consumer  
devices are designed with this in mind... you just have to find what  
you're comfortable with in what situations and live with it.

Yeah, too think there was such a thing as fair use where it was
perfectly legal to take a dvd movie that you own, and convert it to a
format to play on your computer or ipod or refrigerator with a tv screen
on it.  Then a little thing called the DMCA came along and made a bunch
of that illegal (although I guess some exceptions have been made in
certain situations or something).  And, GASP, you make a copy of a cd
that you keep in your car so if someone breaks in and runs off with your
cd's your not out a couple hundred bucks.  There's a reason dj's are
much protective of their vinyl then the cd wallet that is just holding
copies of music that's safely kept at home.

My personal belief is it should be 100% legal to take any media on any
format you own and convert it to any other format to match the context.
 Converting a format to anything is going to degrade the quality.  You
can't take a VHS, burn it onto an HD DVD and magically it's 1080p high
def.  I rip cd's at 160kbps mp3.. I still have those cd's when people
have 100 terrabyte hard drives and can encode flac.  Even when I
digitize records I only encode those at 192 since if I ever did figure
out CDjs I could take that 192, burn it to a cd and even on really loud
systems wouldn't sound horrible (albeit--by definition--not as good as
the original).

I find it funny when I get some live mix that was encoded to 320kbps.
Seriously, just use flac at that point.  Didn't the original mp3 codec
only encode to 112kb? or maybe that was the free version and the paid
one went higher.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Producers saying MP3 audio quality sucks (and so do CDs)

MPEG was designed to allow for multiple video and audio streams per  
MPEG transport stream. MPEG is pretty fucking brilliant actually.  
MPEG files are actually akin to the capture of a real time event, the  
file on your computer is a stream, just in file format, captured in a  
neat little package.

You can have raw MPEG files, or you can have MPEG transport streams.  
Your computer or device doesn't care, it'll play them either way,  
usually defaulting to the first audio and video channels. Think of a  
transport stream the entire bundle of channels coming over the radio,  
and the definition of what channel is where, and what kind of data is  
on each station. That VOB file on your DVD's is an encrypted  
transport stream.

Without getting entirely nerdy, you could have a single MPEG  
transport stream on your computer or disc or whatever as a file that  
has something like this on it:

Stream 1: HD video
Stream 2: SD video
Stream 3: h264 portable formatted video
Stream 4: Closed Captioning Data
Stream 5: English AC3 5.1 Audio
Stream 6: English Stereo Audio
Stream 7: Swahili AC3 5.1 Audio
Stream 8: Video Overlay (My muppets from space video has this, it's  
great. MST3K's the movie with Gonzo and Kermit as the audience.)

While this file would be giant, it's would be trivial to use the  
mapping information in the file to just strip out say, the portable  
video and the stereo audio, and just copy this stuff over to a  
device. You could use the same file to watch something on multiple  
tv's (SD and HD) in your house at the same time. The possibilities  
are really endless... but...

Seeing anything that takes advantage of this will probably never  
happen. Instead, what you'll see are devices like sling boxes and  
whatnot that have specialized encoding chips for re-encoding, doing  
some sort of backwards kind of encoding to get around retarded  
limitations of physical media.

Engineering for consumer devices is retarded. You shouldn't HAVE to  
re-encode anything in the first place. When you buy some sort of  
digital media, you should be able to have the ability play the thing  
anywhere with little modification. Ideally, this would allow you to  
avoid the problems with re-encoding the media on your own.

But it'll never happen, so forget about it. We've standardized on 100  
different file formats rather than the one that was engineered  
correctly in the first place because of licensing issues, lack of  
knowledge on the subject, general desire to make everything  
proprietary, and DRM. Heck you could even DRM-ize regular MPEG as  
part of the transport stream, but once again, retarded legal issues  
stand in the way.

You mean plain ol .mpg files can do containers? Never knew that, aside
from there being a couple formats like mpeg2 and such.

I know all about putting multiple formats into a single file.  I watch a
lot of anime fan subs and the ones I have I really like I'll rip onto
the computer so I don't have to hunt for the dvd or switch dvds every
few episodes.  In that whole "scene" Matroska (.mkv) files are
constantly used.  Not only can they store multiple video and audio
tracks (japanese and english audio) they can hold multiple subtitles
(english, director commentary) and the actual tracks from the dvd.  For
the anime snobs like me that want to watch it in japanese with english
subtitles, I can.  For those that rather just watched the dubbed
version, they can do that.  When I ripped Appleseed (btw, cool movie
(it's the second one that's all CG and stuff)) it has all these things
in it:

1. video that I encoded with xvid
2. english audio
3. japanese audio
4. directory commentary audio
5. english subtitles
6. directory commentary subtitles
(all the chapters are indexed as well)

and using high quality video settings the file is 1.18GB for an 1:45
movie.  I then had fun and made one less than 700mb so it would fit on a
cd.  Video quality was noticeably worse.  So I then made one with just
english audio and director commentary subtitles.  Since I still want to
watch the movie I can watch the directory commentary via subtitles
instead of hearing them speak in japanese the whole time and I would
have to read the subtitles anyway.  I've done that when watching other
movies if they have it (a lot don't seem to subtitle director
commentary) so I can still watch the movie but see what the director
comments are if I want to read them.

Now, all that is fine and dandy, except that video won't play on my
iphone, I would have to re-encode the dvd to h.264 and the right
resolution and stuff.  I guess one of apple's video formats support
containers, so you could distribute a single file to play on web,
iphone, etc and the device would automatically pick the right one.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Producers saying MP3 audio quality sucks (and so do CDs)

Remember though...not everything is vinyl appropriate.  If your work
involves low frequency panning you wouldnt be able to put it on vinyl
without centering the LFs unless you want the needle to jump.  But if
your just making "club oriented" music you may as well produce
everything in mono.  I would rather not work with limitations though.
The laws of physics are already limiting enough as it is.

It does what I need it to do. When I had a blackberry, it was much
more stable and flexible, alas, the company doesn't support them
anymore.

They do pair up well with a slingbox, and tcpmp is great. My q is too
freaking slow to get away with not re-encoding video tho.

wtf voicemail notification is broken on this thing.

Subject: {pb-cle} Crate Digging

The Upper Arlington Public Library near Columbus is beefed up their
library sale this week. Amongst the offerings there are a few hundred
records. I picked up some organ music, some 1960's jungle drum records
(meant for tiki parties), wax labeled with only the word "DISCO",
about a half dozen sing along with mitch albums, and a bunch of other
stuff generally in good shape.

Most of the stuff here comes from dead people who've had their stuff
donated to the library and there's lots of good stuff from the 1960's
that's in really good shape. There's a ton of great horns in some Herb
Alpert collections, and god knows what else I didn't have time to dig
for.

Everything is 50 cents, and there's some hidden gems. Just an FYI.

I have a terminal with ssh so I can remotely connect to any server I
need to.  And I could have an NES emulator, doom, run a web server, ftp
client, irc client and a bunch of other stuff (iPhoneInstaller ftw).

I thought that was just an iphone thing.  Yeah thats something that
really annoys me, but I found I never really sent many MMS messages
before so don't really miss them.  Probably figure with email you're not
limited to the specs for MMS messages, if the person can even receive
the message on the other end, if they have to pay a lot for MMS
messages, etc.  But I can send an email with a picture to anyone and
they're going to be able to read it.  What sucks is I can't even receive
SMS messages, it pretends like the phone can't display and it says to go
to some website to view it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} windows mobile 5...

i have so many complaints as we go along lololol. i can only download
certian files for the phone as well. like - i tried dling a snes
emulator, and was going to save it to my mini disc instead of the
phones hardrive. i get some error msg saying "this file does not
support this blah blah blah". i figured i could take the file from the
mini disc and transport it to my pc for installation. but nooooo. i
wouldnt have to do the run around if i had the net at my place. i had
it shut off for personal reasons in my apt - which really f'ing makes
things harder for me..

anyways. enough of my rants =)

Imagine "having the internet in the palm of you hand."  For being a
"closed platform" that apple was trying to make it, the iphone has
become one of the most open phones out there.  I can now transfer files
to and from it the same exact way I send files to a web server.  This
will sure make full backups nice and easy :)

That's your carrier's messup, not Windows Mobile. in fact I think all the
complaints you've said are carrier issues... Whos' your carrier? (Just so I
can avoid them).

I tried palm's OS... it only single tasks.... It's strengths are simplicity
though. That's Windows Mobile's weakness, there's 100 ways to do anything,
and it starts to get confusing on how to do anything.

Personally I think 'flat' would be technically perfect since it's then
how it was originally intended, but I'll still give this one a shot.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} The "Pefect" equalizer setting in iTunes

I don't have a windows box anymore, so I don't have winamp and this  
plugin, but iZotope Ozone for Winamp/WMP has settings to "fix" audio  
coming from various encoders. Ozone works sort of like a mastering  
suite... it has multiband compression, reverb, a harmonic exciter and  
some other goodies. I've got the AU on my mac for various things and  
it's brilliant. It mostly compensates for crappy encoding and poor  
listening environment without coloring the sound too much.

Other than that, I don't think the formats suck so much as the  
players. And WTF is with the "Sound Enhancer" in iTunes? It sounds  
like complete ass.

mikes right. verizon is the only carrier that allows picture text with
the moto q. as far as getting the sit and passwords for picture texts
that come thru - my phone started doing that when i moved back to
pitts. i believe it has something to do with my carrier and sprint
(cause theres sprint towers here). dunno..

im gonna call my asshole carriers today and ask them what the deal is.
ill tell you what they say.

ps - not all the issues i have are with the carrier, its mostly the
phone itself.

It's really difficult to point the finger correctly with windows mobile
devices. I've developed devices that ran on windows mobile, and it goes
something like this:

Microsoft provides 'platform builder', which is basically a drag and drop
environment where a chipset manufacturer can build up what's called a "board
support package". It consists of drivers for the CPU and USB, network, stuff
like that.

So Motorola gets the BSP for the processor and adds drivers for the specific
model of phone - 'Q' in this case. they probably throw in a custom display
driver. At this point the .BSP should be complete.

Now the ISP gets the phone with the .bsp and they drag and drop what
features they want on the phone - Media player, outlook, SQL server(!)
etc... They add software support for interpreting the data coming across the
wire - in this case MMS messages - how to store them and display them to the
user.

At any rate, Windows mobile is a slick OS... In many ways it's superior to
Windows XP and such. It's amazingly full featured, providing most of the
functionality of XP, but able to ditch any and all legacy issues - for
instance all WM programs are UNICODE, a big advancement from XP IMO.

So really there's no reason whatsoever that a multimedia attachment has to
be shown from a website. It's drop dead simple to have a developer write a
little app to display it, it would take less than a man-week. Microsoft
didn't flesh out areas of Windows Mobile where standards deviate (such as in
how picture messages are sent over the various carriers), and this has lead
to some real crappy implementations by the carriers, but I think it's far
from MS's fault in this case. The carriers spend much more time trying to
mod the phones so they can't be used on other carriers networks, and so that
you have to pay for ringtones, and crap like that.. End user experience
enrichment is way down the priority list.

There's really nothing that you could point your finger at in Windows Mobile
that couldn't be replaced or changed / fixed by a carrier, with the
exception of stuff like windows mobile 5.0 limiting apps to 32meg of virtual
memory, and 32 processes... Windows mobile 6.0 fixes all that though so that
you get 2gig of virtual memory and 32k processes.

For instance once I developed a BSP and built an iPod like device using
windows mobile, No one could tell it's even using windows mobile... the
whole shell / menu system wasn't even on the device, it just booted straight
into the .MP3 player which looked nothing like windows / windows mobile. You
may even own other windows mobile devices and not even know it - it can
operate headless, running stuff like intelligent routers and such.

Having said all that, and having owned many CE / Windows mobile devices...
Windows Mobile could use a dose of simplifying on the default user
interface... it's entirely possible for carriers to simplify it, but IMO, MS
should lead the charge by providing a more simplified base implementation.
Scaling down the Windows XP user interface just doesn't cut it.

That was a well thought out, written, and punctuated email.

I felt the need to point that out.

Yeah, it's to good to belong on this list.

That can be fixed really quick though...  I say a linux os would be
better than a micro$oft os.  PWND!  OMGWTFBBQPIE!! EVIE STEE!!  There
thats better.

One thing of note on the whole carrier locking down phones.  When I got
my phone with verizon it just came out.  It was "the mp3 player" of cell
phones (which I hardly ever used).  Well there were some bugs and so
they had a firmware update.  One of these "bugs" was to disable mp3
support because it's not DRM and forcing you to use .wma on it.  They
also then called it a portable music playing device instead of mp3
player.  Needless to say I didn't need that bug fixed so I stayed at the
old version.

I like with the iphone people that have never had an iAnything or only
used to regular phones are like "OMG apple adds new features to a
phone!!"  I know the did that a little with ipods as well where some new
features may get added to old ones.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sun Sep 02                          DJ T                         Pittsburgh

Thomas Koch (aka DJ T) is one of the most influential faces in dance music
today. Over the past 20 years he has held residencies at top venues from
the Frankfurt club scene such as Music Hall, Plastik, Dorian Gray, XS and
The Box; started Groove - one of Germanys biggest music magazines, and
opened the world famous club Monza in Frankfurt. All of this is well and
good, but its his work in the past five years that has really aimed the
worldwide clubbing spotlight towards him. In 2002, DJ T founded 'Get
Physical Music' along with the guys behind M.A.N.D.Y. and Booka Shade.
Since then, Get Physical has dominated DJ charts and the global press,
turning the industry upside down and single-handedly taking the
minimal/electro scene in a new direction.

Humanaut would like to invite you to an evening of upfront,
forward-thinking dance music as DJ T makes Pittsburgh (and Humanaut's 1
year anniversary party) one of only six stops in his North American tour.
The experience may just change your contact solution.

POPNONAME is 28-year-old artist and musician Jens-Uwe Beyer. Five years

His releases receive a great deal of attention in both the international 
music press and in DJ reviews. His records are already played by most 
respected DJs such as JAMES HOLDEN or JOHN DIGWEED and have received a 
lot of positive feedback from the internet radio community LAST FM. The 
Swedish DIGFI magazine writes: "POPNONAME is actually the "Jack Kerouac" 
of Cologne Techno and he is a real sensation!"

Fri Sep 21                  NU-MARK AND ROC RAIDA                  Columbus

DJ Nu-Mark
Hip Hop // Soul (Breaks) // Brazilian (Samba) // Jurassic 5 // Blend 
Crafters . Los Angeles
www.myspace.com/djnumark

For well over ten years, DJ Nu-Mark has been among Hip-Hop.s most 
respected DJs and producers. Recognized for his membership in the gold 
selling group Jurassic 5, Nu-Mark is best known for his production on 
the raw anthem .What.s Golden. and the smooth and soulful .Work It Out,. 
featuring Dave Matthews. Additionally, his innovative DJ routines and 
creative on-stage antics have made him a favorite of crowds all over the 
world.

Perhaps best known for their thrilling stage show, Jurassic 5 has toured 
the globe several times over, and have made numerous television 
appearances. With Jurassic 5, Nu-Mark has performed at many of the 
world.s most important and exciting music festivals . Coachella, 
Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza 2003, Australia.s Big Day Out, The UK.s Reading 
Festival, and Japan.s Summer Sonic . where his mastery of a complex, 
six-piece DJ rig and his playful incorporation of children.s musical 
toys have amazed and delighted crowds of up to 50,000 fans. Jurassic 5 
has appeared alongside many of music.s greats, including A Tribe Called 
Quest, the Wu-Tang Clan, Outkast, The Roots, Run DMC, Green Day, and 
even Bruce Springsteen.

Nu-Mark is responsible for half of the production of Jurassic 5.s entire 
body of work: Jurassic 5 EP (1997), Quality Control (2000), Power In 
Numbers (2002), and Feedback (2006). He has also released his own 
projects, independent of the group: Blend Crafters, an instrumental 
album created in the spirit of allowing beats to speak for themselves, 
and Hands On, a mix-CD. Hands On assembles a diverse and eclectic set of 
sounds, everything from soulful breaks to comedic skits, as well as 
classic underground jams, and includes a special section devoted to 
hip-hop from around the world. By turns hilarious and impressive, this 
project displays both Nu-Mark.s eccentric sense of humor and his 
devotion to solid, simply dope music. Currently, Nu-Mark is placing his 
beats on a number of projects in a variety of genres.

Nu-Mark began DJing as a teenager in Los Angeles. Over the course of the 
last two decades, he has amassed a collection of over 35,000 records and 
refined his technical skills and performance style to the point where he 
is widely recognized as one of the key figures in the late-90s DJ 
explosion which pushed the DJ to the front of the culture.s awareness. 
As a result of this distinction, Nu-Mark has been featured in a 
diversity of publications and in several films: the critically acclaimed 
documentary .Scratch,. .KeepinTime. (which features impromptu 
collaborations with Mad Lib, Cut-Chemist, Babu, J-Rocc, and drummers 
James Gatson and Paul Humphrey), .Coachella: The Movie,. and .Rock the 
Bells . The Documentary..

Today, Nu-Mark is well-known for his innovative plays on sound . 
attaching a rubber band to his turntable.s needle and playing it like an 
upright bass or tapping on the turntable.s dust cover to simulate a bass 
drum. Incorporating a wide range of musical styles . soul, funk, 
hip-hop, and samba effortlessly blended together . Nu-Mark revels in 
surprising an audience with a forgotten gem, an unknown banger, or a 
fresh take on a well-known hit. From Sao Paolo to Sydney, from Toronto 
to Tokyo, Nu-Mark.s carefully crafted, explosively energetic DJ sets 
never fail to get a party rocking.

ROC RAIDA
HIP HOP // TURNTABLIST // X-ECUTIONERS ·· NY

Roc Raida began his DJ career in the early eighties at the age of ten. 
Surrounded by such inspirations as his father, a member of the Sugar 
Hill Records act Mean Machine and hip hop impresario Grandmaster Flash, 
Raida cultivated his interest into an absolute passion. Now, Roc Raida 
is considered among the best of the contemporary DJ.s and has brought 
the underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.
In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who, for obvious of copyright reasons, later 
became known as the X-ecutioners. Champions of furthering the 
turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made their reputation by 
utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the manual alteration between 
individual kick and snare sounds to create original drum patterns in 
real time. This practice has been an inspiration and a force in Roc 
Raida.s style.
In the beginning defeat was commonplace, as battles were mainly 
popularity contests. The more contests he entered the more the 
competition began to appreciate his style and determination. Pushing his 
limits and raising the standard with which DMC.s are judged, Raida began 
to get noticed. His impressive finishes in some of the premier DJ 
battles; first place in the 1991 "As One"; second place in the "Superman 
Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC US Finals were just the 
beginning. In 1995 Raida, was crowned the DMC World Champion in front of 
a massive London audience.
The past several years have seen Raida traveling around the globe 
promoting the art of Turntablism in such exotic locations as Singapore, 
Turkey, Japan and Australia. Last year on a panel at the Rock-n-Roll 
Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of 
Hip-Hop.s founding fathers. Rules for this dubious honor state that one 
may only be bestowed with the approval of another Grandmaster, Raida was 
not only approved, but welcomed by Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore and 
scratch evolutionist DST. To round out a phenomenal decade, Raida was 
inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the 1999 DMC World Finals in New 
York City.
Roc Raida was recently featured on an episode of "Saturday Night Live"; 
the first DJ to ever share the stage with the fabled SNL band. Proving, 
once again, that Raida is the perfect example of a master perfecting his 
art.
Turntablism has come up through the rave culture and is now showcased at 
every Electronic Music happening with crews such as The X-Ecutioners, 
Invisbl Skratch Piklz, Allies and Beat Junkies headlining events 
worldwide. Now with the success of the X-Ecutioners record .Built from 
Scratch. and .Revolutions. Raida has taken a step forward to work on his 
first solo effort .Raida.s Talent Search. which will be a CD and DVD 
combined showing Raida.s production and turntablists efforts as well as 
his comedy sketches throughout the DVD. Raida is also currently working 
on his autobiography of his life. Look out! As it is time for 
Grandmaster Roc Raida to take the world by storm once again.

Thu Sep 27                         KASKADE                         Columbus

www.kaskademusic.com
View e-flyer and sample CD at: www.ultrarecords.com/ECards/Kaskade
Bring the Night is the latest mix album by house DJ/producer Kaskade. 
Released on Ultra Records, Bring the Night is crafted to give unwavering 
house heads what they want most in a mix album: it delivers on the party 
front and drops the big room jams. And true to Kaskade styleand what 
differentiates this artist from others in dance musicBring the Night 
also manages to serve up those trademark melodies and sensual vocals.
But more than anything, this is 115 minutes of feel good body rock. 
"With my artist albums, I'm conveying emotion, I'm constructing beats 
and writing songs that represent me as an artist and a person, so it 
doesn't necessarily come out as 'dance heavy,'" says Kaskade. "But a mix 
CD is about walking the line, and fitting my style in with the DJ side 
of things. Yeah, I want to keep it musical and fresh, but Bring the 
Night is intentionally produced very rhythmic andwell, banging. This is 
a head bobbing mix, something to pop in your car and thump."
And with 15 hard-hitting tracks, including Dance Chart topping Kaskade 
remixes of Nelly Furtado's "All Good Things (Come To An End)", and 
Floetry's "SupaStar," Bring the Night achieves just thatit's a non-stop, 
seamless stream of orchestrated beats and flavor, all with a nod to the 
night life.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Somehow the time slots on the second stage got pushed back by 1/2 hour.  She
was supposed to spin from 5-6, but ended up spinning from 5:30-6:30.  And I
played my scheduled time on the main stage from 6-7.  Oh well.  Still had a
blast!

OK Brian Silverraver, I know you were there taking a few pics.  Got them
