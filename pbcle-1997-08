hey everybody...

just like everyone else who went to the last steel city jungle, dieselboy
blew me away. does anyone have a copy of his set on tape? i am very
interested in getting a copy, so i will offer a 2-for-1 trade on it -- if
you can dub me a copy of this tape, i'll copy you any two (out of 70+
mixtapes) that i have listed on my webpage (plenty of uk jungle w/ mcs,
us jungle, house, techno, trance, breaks, trip-hop). the address is:

http://www.paranoia.com/~absolut/tapes

thanks a bunch.

 me, nicole, and eric d (who is spinning there) and someone else are going
with pat f.;
im very curious to check out vapourspace and dv8 when ever theyre
performing, and of course everyone is all hyping about dj Funk.... also if
you went to delphi, this is your chance to see Frankie Bones. he is
spinning for free because of the mixup that crazy night.
if you have a chance to go to this.. do it; there is no reason to miss a
bargain like this one!

see you on the other side.
love peter

	Has anyone heard the album by the duo called Double 99?
I guess it's supposed to be this great fusion of jungle and house
music buy I haven't found it anywhere...

fun party. got there right when funk came on. not what i expected. ive
heard most of those songs on a mixtape too. then Odi came and waxed the
shit out of our ears. that was mind bending. next up: osheen ..splendid.
somewhere in between or after there was a live pa dv8 who had some great
sounds but needed to change up his beats a lil more in my opinion.  then i
started going upstairs cuz my friends were spinning up in the boxing room;
mike/stick and eric d (who had a phat set saturday evening that EVERYONE
missed). lots of nitrous at that party. lots of crystal and E too, as per
usual. but the drugs were more of stiff competitive market up there. lots
of tension and too many people asking me if i wanted E. that stuff rarely
happens to me anymore. in the morning we went to the beach... but couldnt
find the one that we agreed to go to so i ended up with a couple friends at
a beach  and then drove back to oil city to sleep for a bit. we came back
to the party in the evening on saturday, went to the mall, and came back;
stayed through dcypols set when pat and friends (my ride) bailed out on me
and were tired. so i drive them home (in his car) and worked on some tracks
at home then slept. i wish i couldve stayed for vapourspace and whilhelm K
and evrything else crazy that would have happened but i still had
funfunfunfunfunfunfunfunfunfun :)

what did everyone else think??????????

Since people have raised questions and are interested in what really
happened with Vapourspace, let me explain the whole thing.

Mark Gage (that's his real name), came from Rochester on Friday night
and was ready to go on after DV8 - at 3 am. Unfortunately, due to the
moisture in the room, the main sequence patterns of his set could not be
loaded on his computer and were basically lost. He had a back-up
sequence stored on a DAT, but no DAT recorder could be located in the
time needed. 

He was really keen on playing at the party, and since we were able to
create a time slot for him on Saturday, he decided to drive back to
Rochester and fix the problem with his machine.

I have known Mark for 7 years since I went to school in Rochester and
have seen him perform live in his house over 20 times. Therefore, my
review may be little impartial. But I thought that the material he
played (a mix of 30% old and 70% new) was really impressive. In the hour
and 15 minutes of performance he played the Gravitational Arch of 10 and
two other older tracks with a decent amount of variation from the
original. This was only his 3rd live performance in the US over the last
1.5 years (LA and Detroit were the other 2), and the first one where he
played new material from his album coming out on POLYGRAM records on
November 10.

Lot of people have never even heard of him before, and were not familiar
with what he may play. But I can tell you that as soon as he was
finished, there were more than a few congratulating him and asking lots
of questions. Personally, alongside with Hardware's performance the
night before, he was the highlight of the party based not solely on my
opinion, but also on opinions of other people that I had talked to me. 

Please add any other comments you may have on Vapourspace's performance,
and the whole party in general.

Thanks.

You are right Michael,

Just talked to Mark Gage this morning and he told me that he played in
Dayton last year. Sorry for the confusion and the misinformation, but it
was purely based on his account of recent American performances.

Then it's not a unique one.  I've gone through two HDs in the past year 
due to travel-related damage.  Lost my BBS on the way back from school

"The Land of Make Believe"  Day One  Friday  August 1, 1997

Erie, Pennsylvania?  Well, after "landing" there Friday evening and
remaining blissfully glued to one of the best parties of the 1997 summer
season, I'm now a "believer"!

"The Venue"

On Friday, things started rolling around 11:00 P.M. at the Continental
Ball Room in downtown Erie.  Actually, when I say "downtown", don't
conjure up ideas of large office buildings all around.  This was more a
melange of working class neighborhood and industrial park -- perhaps not
the greatest place to raise a family but an excellent location to have a
party. 

The Continental had two floors.  The first level was the primary party
room. It had a variety of chairs and benches along three quarters of the
perimeter.  Chip from Eyegasm had set up his lights and lasers on this
floor. 15,000-20,000 watts of sound was just perfect for this main room. 
The second level, which opened up a little later on, was actually a boxing
facility with a ring in the center and a handful of heavy bags in the
back.  This would serve as a chill out room and later as a second dj room. 
On this second floor, there was another mini room in the back.  There
wasn't a light in this dusty room, and as you could imagine, certain
commerce tended to flock there.

Although the Continental might pride itself as a ballroom, it felt much
more like a warehouse.  And this vibe certainly set the tone for the
party.  Another major advantage was the fact that there was no security. 
This place had "FREEDOM" written all over it.  Coming from the Cleveland
tradition, I could feel the difference immediately.  In a larger city,
there are certain realities that just don't apply to smaller places -- the
need for posted security officers being at the top of the list.  So
without the constant look over the shoulder to worry about, what would
otherwise play a more secretive role became a prominent, out in the open,
feature of this party.  This would be even more so on the second night,
but I'm getting ahead of myself.

"The Promoters"  

If you don't already know him, it's time that you meet Viktor Mizo. 
Viktor has got to be one of the nicest and most together promoters of our
generation.  Although promoters usually have reputations for being at
least somewhat shady, I can't say I've met a better counter-example in my
life.  In fact, let's stop calling Viktor a "promoter" because this guy
was more a "host" than anything else.  From the minute this party started
to the second it paused at 8:00 A.M. on Saturday morning, Viktor stood
outside the main door.  He wasn't counting money, he was making sure that
the door remained closed so the sound bleed wouldn't cause the neighbors
to call the police and shut it down.  Then, despite the posted rules of no
re-admission, Viktor gladly allowed people to come outside for a quick
breather (it was very hot inside).  And when too many people were
congregating outside (causing a potential problem if a police cruiser
happened to pass by), Viktor would run from the door to politely encourage
them to return inside so as not to give away that there was a rave going
on indoors.  Instead of enjoying himself, Viktor raced from the door to
the groups and back, over and over again.  He could have easily have just
told them to stay inside.  Hell, he could have just locked the front door
after 2:00 and said, "That's it".  But he didn't.  He did everything in
his power to make this an outstanding experience for everyone.  On many
occasions, I watched him introduce people to each other -- people he felt
ought to know each other for whatever reason.  He also made out of towners
feel special for coming all the way to his city.  As I said, Viktor wasn't
just a promoter, he was a host.  Besides paying attention to all the
details, booking the dj's, posting the flyers, securing the location and
all of that stuff, he made the evening magical -- and all this without a
moment of frustration or tension (at least on the outside).  If you
haven't met Viktor Mizo or been to one of his parties, it's time you go!
I should also mention that Ernest of Liquid Sound Distortion did a fine
job too.

"The Music"

Before going to the party, I stopped by a bar downtown called Sherlock's.
I always like to get a little of the local flavor if only as a grounding
to the fantastic music that awaits me at the real party.  Well, as far as
Sherlock's goes, they don't call it Erie for nothing.  It was a nightmare.
To make matters worse, I sacrificed half of DJ Funk's set to experience
this.  

Fortunately, I caught all of DJ Hardware (who incidentally played trance).
This guy from Florida made a really strong impression on everyone, I
think, and I heard that he was booked for two other shows immediately
afterwards as a result.

Next up was John of DV8 (Vapourspace was switched as everyone on this list
already knows).  With a slight sound problem (mixer), there wasn't the
same oomph to the bass, but beyond that (no fault of John's), it was a
very good set.  Watch out for this guy, apparently, he's got a record on
the way.  He used to be the roommate of Mark Gage from Vapourspace so you
know that he's had a good musical education.  

Odi took control at this point, turning the trance to jungle and breaks
and that stuff.  At my age, you learn that you just can't move fast enough
after 4:00 A.M. to keep up with this kind of music, so I took to the
sidelines.  But I enjoyed watching some fine moves put on by the locals
(has anyone ever seen ~megan from this list dance before?  Looking pretty
good out there, Miss Dwyer :) ).  After a while, I went upstairs to the
boxing room and enjoyed Skywalker play some deep trance and even some Goa. 
Wow. 

The evening ended up with everybody's favorite, Osheen.  All in all, a
delight.

[I'll continue with part 2 later on in the week]

Sincerely,

Braden

there is a new record store here in sandusky that just opened. it's
called invertigo. they don't have much of a selection of vinyl yet but
they're working on getting more & will do special orders anyway. their
specialty is industrial music which i don't know much about, but they
also have hardcore & gabber + some techno. i don't remember their #
right now but if anybody wants it mail me & i'll get it. i bought this
record there but there was no turntable to listen to it on, & i don't
quite yet have enough $ to buy turntables still, so i don't know what
it sounds like. it's by kid sonic on terraform records + is "the
sandman" & "enceladus". i picked it based on the appearance of the
label which looked like a lot of my other records. anyway i'm
impatient so if anybody happens to have it could you write me a little
review? also i bought a double cd by DJ dara of techstep (recommended
=] ), a live mixed cd by joey beltram (also recommended =] ), and a 
logic records compilation cd (not as recommended =/ ), all for $35
including the record; they gave me a good deal. anyway if anybody sent
me a message lately i might not have gotten it since i deleted a lot
of the 800 messages that were here today without reading them so write
back. =D

This comes from a "supposedly" once a DJ at Case. As for Jeff or My
skillz, you only wish for the talent since you lack any at all or even a
personality.

Walt "DJ Zona" Collective Intelligence
====================================================================

what the hell is this, "flame week"?!...talk about kickin a dead horse
...when did i post that, like two months ago?!...

uhm gee, i was never a dj on wruw, that's why i've got 15 90min tapes
of me playing on the air from 1992...that's why a compilation entitled
'music for club kids 1-3' was never put out in '93...feel free to back me
up on this ian...atleast i know for sure he was around that time

this is exactly why i quit being a dj and quit PLRM for that matter...
all this competitive bullshit...i thought gee, maybe if i quit dj'ing
and just dance & help other promotors out with their partys, perhaps
start up a rave zine out of my own pocket to support the entire scene,
people would be happy...but what the fuk do i get...people ragging
about how poor a quality is and how my opinion doesn't count because
i don't dj anymore and i'm just doing it for the fame...so i said fuk
it, why am i wasting all my time, cameras, film, tape recorders,
long distance, gas money, savings, emotions when i could be doing
something else more constructive...

and just recently somebody fukin w/ my v-mail...another thing coming
out of my own pocket to support the entire scene!

so i say fuk it, i retire...and i've still got 'ole friends' like walt
that still want a piece of me?!...someone who i used to drive from baltimore,
to toronto, to philly, to delaware, etc. etc. when i was doing bus trips
...hell i even used to drive him to kent & back just so he can see melissa
...and i'd let alot of things slide because i knew he was low on funds

ok, walt u've dj'ed for a year...u started a production company (and i
was helping u out in the beginning)...but since then u've changed...and
not exactly for the better...and alot of yur ole friends have noticed
...personally i liked u alot better when we were just friends...and this
whole political scene bullshit wasn't between us

an advertised "rave" at Nautica in Cleveland with Moby, Loop Guru
and 808 State? Can anyone confirm this? Rave? Nautica??
Advertised on the radio!?!? Good lord...;)

hehe... yup -- i saw something on the web about that. they said "this
summer, it's all about Bud and music"
...they don't even know the half of it :P

on an equally funny note - i called up the n-sync infoline (734-5252),
just to see if they had any plans on getting their shit together and
throwin another rave, and there was an interesting message - i didn't
know eric d and crew were like that ;)

	Today I was going to Record Exchange to sell some old
Keoki cd's *hangs head in shame* :) I was listening to the local
cleveland top 40 station 92.3, (damn that broken tape deck), well
the dj decided to play a lil 40second snippet of Daft Punk's around
the world and have listeners call in and say what they thought about
this 'different' track.  Well, I had a feeling this would be good.  First
caller felt it sounded "too much like disco and is to repetitive." and
if she wanted to hear disco she'd listen too "the *good* disco that's 
out there". Good Lord.  anyways, 55% of listeners who called in hated
it.  Kinda interesting really, as sometimes this list worries about
the music bein' exploited.....well, the 'experimental-electronica
portion of this mail is over, back to the No Doubt!' :)
	Well, lookin' forward to u4ia tonight, anyone out there goin? :)

laters,

brian

Wassup,

        There are more and more stupid people out there every single day.
Aren't you glad that they don't like techno?  It makes the scene a whole lot
brighter.  I'm personally glad there are no teeny-boppers at raves, and I
hope it always stays that way.  

"In these matters the only certainty is that nothing is certain."
                                        -Pliny the Elder

much love,

-Paco

i'd like to see more people like techno music.
not the scene, atmosphere, or image...the music.
i don't care who they are, or their age or current 
stereotype, but i'd really like to see the music get
extremely popular and played on all radio stations and
tv dance shows and that.  i'd like to see every techno
artist becum rock stars too.  i am not being sarcastic.
and if you think there aren't any teenyboppers at raves,
clean your glasses.

love,
ryu

one thing:: eric d. and phillip dye are not affilliated anymore. eric is
spinning under a new production group and remaining positive about the
scene and there should be no judgment on the content of his character with
regards to the content of the n'sync infoline.

eric just finished his first club event downtown called inMotion and
although the turnout wasnt so gr8 the flow of the party went very well
indeed. dj hazey (who will be at steel city jungle on tuesday) spun some
great progressive house and hard acid and will changeup to some dark
indescribable shit then. look out for this character. opus/formation had
some good records as well to top the night off.

also look out for DEEP flyers because this party is _the_ party of the year
for pittsburgh. most of the dj's (including the rebel crew and the ill
style rockers) actually requested second time slots for the preparty
september 12th, which strikes me as odd because most headliners come to
pittsburgh, spin, and leave. tintonton will probably be at thepreparty as
well, and it is my opinion that he performs better at rrenegades than rave
type parties.

you have been forewarned.




peace.

I'm not sure about that one...I thought 420v2 was one heck of a rave 
and that's where I bought my tickets.  

I don't know about everybody else but commercial sponsership is not 
all bad.  This sort of brings back an old thread I know, but unless 
you're just in the scene for the drugs there can be advantages to 
being legit.  Like not getting shut down two hours into the party.

Oh boy.  I'm probably going to get jumped all over for this one.

hello..just wanted to let everyone know that we went up to u4ia last night
to catch the infamous lady kier. there were a ton of people there, lotsa
people dancing. lady kier came on after many rumors that she would not
even be there. although the crowd seemed to be loving her, and her track
selection was alright, her skills were pretty weak. it didnt seem like
anyone there cared much though, they just came to see a diva.

i prolly should hold my tounge, but this is an area of exposed nerves on me so

now anybody who knows me knows that i'm not mr super-blowpop candyraver, and i'm
not high on PLUR (although i don't think it's a bad idea, i just think it won't
work) but if you've ever been a part of a truly underground renegade party you
will know what i'm talking about when i say the VIBE is incredible.  it's not
the glitter on your cheeks kind of vibe, it's the vibe of, 'we're all in this
together'  at this type of event, the ppl who just come to dance are not merely
consumers, they are participants.  you don't pay at the door and recieve a
service for your money, you come wanting to hlep the whole thing go off and for
it you recieve a kick ass time.

once people, all people, realize that THEY are the party then the whole mode,
the whole mindset is different.
	it's not about the space
	it's not about the lights
	it's not about the sound
	it's not about the record, the dj, or the music even
	this party is about us. about people.  about together.
that includes dancers, dj's, sound and lights crew, the person at the door, etc.
but if just one person thinks 'we are this party' it's not gonna do much, it's
like one lonely vote.  and increasingly i detect a sense of connsumerism from
ppl at parties: "we paid our money, render services"  when ppl come wanting to
be entertained instead of wanting to entertain each other, everybody there is a
lot more likely to get entertained, to have a good time, to smile, to love being
there, to love being with these people, to feel closer to them, etc.

and when everybody knows that they have to be real cool and low-key and slip in
a side door for a map point and get instructions to park down the street, and be
careful not to attract too much attention when you walk around the corner, up
the alley and into the third door, down the narrow staircase on the left....a
whole new world opens up.

hey friend, this shit is [Top Secret] ya know what i mean?

Hell, it's on the 'Top 10 ways to see if your scene is dying out' list;  
came in at #3, actually.

Even if I would be home, I wouldn't go to that one.

 Well, I hope everybody got their copy of the tape (actually, I didn't so 
I prolly need to get a copy from one of you). Now for the j-cards. Here's 
the info: they are done and I am more than willing to mail however many 
copies you need, but I need snail mail addresses for those who want to 
receive them. You can e-mail me at the address above. I will work on 
getting a jpeg version posted somewhere but to whet your appetite the 
ones I'll send you in the mail will be full color on cardstock and 
they're free. I can prolly send about five in an envelope with regular 
postage but if you need more than five I'm sure I can work something out. 
Hopefully people are making many copies for friends, record stores etc. 
and I'm pretty sure I can accomodate any reasonable request.

On another note does anyone know where to get good copies of this tape as 
I am sure I'll need like five at least for friends.

I'm sure this will do a whole helluva lot for the frat boy problem we've
been complaining about all this time to.  I'd like to see some surly 280
pound guy try to dance.  That would be amusing, but I bet if you laughed at
him you'd get beat up real good.  Alcohol just brings about violence,
exactly what we don't want going on in our scene.  It has a bad enough
reputation already.  Oh well, just anouther thought.

you know last year i would have agreed with this statement, but ive come to
realize it only brings out violence if youre a violent person and it really
doesnt matter if its in our scene or not. in America it is a symbol of
growing up; a social status thing, not a violent thing. it really sucks
when par-ties like Electric Kingdom (northside kast year) get busted
because of it, but thats one of those things that we cant really change
because its illegal to drink underage.

in Germany, where the best trance comes from,  there is mad amounts of
alcohol consumed at their raves. Personally, i would rather see more
alcohol at our parties and less nitrous, less K, less crystal and more e,
even though all of these drugs are secondary consumables to me.  you know
id like to complain a lil bit about how too many come to raves to increase
their social status more than anything else like their being sold a ticket
to some wonderful new haven of peace love unity and respect, because these
are the people that end up like me and start complaining about shit all the
time.

thats why i say we should let people drink if they want to drink, because
lord knows its better for your brain than nitrous is, and might actually
help you become a friendlier person. granted, its poison and not very good
for your liver and motor skills; but getting drunk once in awhile can be a
very good spiritual thing to some people.

yoyo there is a nice phat space where lots of shit is going down on weekday
nites downtown (remeniscent of 168). Double N Productions is working on a
"periodic event created for your pleasure, not your social advancement"
(like that? i made it up:) called Interstellar Groove. Last monday they had
dj Alaska(ny) Stitches (happy hardcore) and many many more and the turnout
was very lethargic.. lots of people into the scene but not really there to
dance or do drugs either. there is a full bar there (easy to get served but
you didnt hear me say that)

next sunday the 17th Interstellar Groove will be hosting Ground Zero from
the 216, Smoov, Smartie, XL, the Red Headed Step Child, the Instigator,
Tommy Illnigga, and more. it last from 8 till four.

remember, this is a place to have fun, not come with an attitude that so
many ravers had at laga. most people at this club will be party kids but
the ones that came the first time integrated well with the rest of the
world and know how to have a good time without lasers, high ceilings and
fog machines.

for more info call 412.734.8424 (Double N productions)

a last-minute opportunity arose to bring finnish minimalists PANASONIC to
columbus, so here it is.  PANASONIC is one of the most important musical
outfits operating today, and their presence in ohio is welcome indeed (and
highly unusual, to say the least!).  don't miss your chance to check out
how these lads from finland break techno down into its component parts.

anti ghb...i agree.....
however toxidity in an e + alchohol situation is NOT an issue...
dehydration is...and that kills...
however...if that doesn't bother you.....alchohol + e = less roll.....(you
see because alchohol is a depresant and toxic in and of itself)

ghb + alchohol=liver damage, dehydration perhaps death
lets educate....but not via wives tales (lsd makes your brain
bleed.....mdma is cut with heroin...you know)

David,

I was under the impression that MDMA and MDA are MAO inhibitors in which
case you should *not* take alcohol.

Dear ravers,

I need your help....to build a mega website dedicated to rave poetry.
Imagine....tons of rave poems for everyone to read. And I'm requesting
all of you to contribute. 

These lists that we have subscribed are very informative. We talk about
parties, DJs, music etc which is good but the deeep feelings that we all
have about our scene are still deeep inside. So, I'm working on giving
these voices a home. A rave poetry homepage. And I need your help.

How can you help?
All you have to do is donate the poems you have written or will write for
the rave poetry homepage. I'll create and maintain the page. REMEMBER:
I'm not profiting anything from this. This is my/your/our contribution to
the rave scene. 

What can you write about?
Anything to do with the word "rave". 

Where do I send my poems to?	
Send all poems to nakarmi@juno.com
Write "rave poetry homepage" in "subject" box
	
include in your message(this is optional):

your name
title of the poem
the city that you live in
the country that you live in
the date the poem was written
your e-mail address
URL to your homepage 

The above info will be included with the poem. Or you can stay anonymous.

P.L.U.R

sare

Hey all who have homepages on the WWW
I am collecting addresses to link to a new site..looking for rave and
personal expession works of art. (I know a lot of Pb-Cle raves mailing lists
participants have amazing sites )  I know a lot of you put your site on your
posts......and yes I had been collecting them......however AOHell and I had a

mixing any two substances can be dangerous because there sometimes is
synergy but ive never heard any problem mixing beer and e pills. i dont
know what MAO inhibitors are so you probably know more than me about that.
GHB and Alcohol on the other hand iS *BaD nEwS* david is correct...i saw
about five people feeling like they were going to die after drinking just
one beer and a couple shots of ghb.

sure, frankie :)

i don't know what GHB stands for, but 'g' as it is called is a icky-tasting
syrupy liquid that is ingested orally, sometimes mixed into a coke or fruit
juice.  about 1.5 mL is one dose and some people can handle as much as two doses
but it is not recommended.  often people take a .75 to 1. mL dosage of g to
increase thier energy level without affecting their perception (this is popular
among weight lifters i am told). a fell dosage renders the effects of alcohol
but does not yeild the sleepyness when it wears off as alcolhol does. the
effects set in in 20-45 minutes and last from two to four hours.  a larger
dosage will yeild the numb lips and tingly appendages kind of effects of nitrous
and the skewed perception of a mildly hallucinigenic effect.  as dosage
increases, balance and attention span fall off sharply.  at and beyond two
dosages (either simultaneously ingested or if the second dosage is taken at the
end of the first) one becomes endangered of slipping into a deep sleep or coma
and usually an upset stomach.  this is not usually harmful, but because you
can't be woken up it is usually pretty scary for the other people around you.  i
don't really know how much one has to take to be in severe immediate medical
danger, and i don't know what the effects of the drug on the brain are.  GHB is
not scheduled illegal either to posess, use or distribute (to my knowledge as of
this writing).  GHB is known to be toxic mixed with alcohol (but that would be
silly to do anyway because the effects are about the same).  it is also
cautioned that ingesting your dosage too fast will cause a nasty, nasty upset
stomach though one usually does not vomit.  if it's addictive, it's not
physically addictive beyond alcohol.

GHB has not been tested (to my knowledge) by the FDA and although i cannot find
any reports of death attributed to GHB, the long term effects are not known.

i am quite anti-GHB because i found my limits (or slightly beyond) at a club
this week and fell into a deep sleep sitting up in a booth.  two friends of mine
tried to wake me up for five minutes and were *really* scared that i may not.

it tastes like shit and it's not worth it to me when it does that to the people
i love.

i am by no means an authority on the subject, but i'm trying to find someone who
is to give us a better picture of what the stuff may be.

easy,

--gill

Hey, read some abstracts before taking...

TI: [EEG changes during sedation with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid]
TO: EEG-Veranderungen unter Sedierung mit gamma-Hydroxybuttersaure (GHB).
AU: Entholzner-E; Mielke-L; Pichlmeier-R; Weber-F; Schneck-H
AD: Institut fur Anaesthesiologie, Technischen Universitat Munchen.
SO: Anaesthesist. 1995 May; 44(5): 345-50 ISSN: 0003-2417
PY: 1995
LA: GERMAN; NON-ENGLISH
CP: GERMANY
AB: Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring transmitter
in
the mammalian brain, related to sleep regulation and possibly to energy
balance in diving or hibernating animals. It has been used for almost 35
years as an intravenous agent for induction of anaesthesia and for
long-term sedation. Its convincing pharmacological properties, without
serious adverse effects on circulation or respiration, are compromised by
its unpredictable duration of action. This is not a major problem with
long-term sedation during ICU treatment. GHB has been used with good
results for sedation of patients with severe brain injury, where it
compares favourably with barbiturates. In animal studies, it seems to
possess a protective action against hypoxia on a cellular and whole organ
level. However, in some experimental animals GHB has been shown to produce
seizure-like activities, and the compound is being used to produce
absence-like seizures. GHB has been used in our ICU for years to provide
adequate sedation for patients under controlled ventilation or for
patients
fighting the respirator during spontaneous respiration. No serious side
effects were observed in these patients, while in some patients under
haemodialysis hypernatraemia and metabolic alkalosis developed; both were
reversible after discontinuation of GHB and restriction of additional
sodium input (Somsanit, the commercially available GHB preparation in
Germany, contains 9.2 mmol sodium/g; the daily dose averages 20-40 g GHB,
i.e. 180-370 mmol sodium). PATIENTS AND METHODS. In 31 patients after
major
abdominal surgery, sedation was established with GHB 50 mg/kg BW injected
via perfusion pump over a 20-min period. No centrally acting medication
had
been given for at least 2 h. A computer-based multichannel EEG system
(CATEEM, MediSyst, Linden) was used, allowing for fast Fourier
transformation, spectral analysis and topographical brain mapping. EEG
during induction of sedation was followed after a baseline EEG (10 min)
had
been recorded. Patients receiving long-term sedation were studied daily
for
an additional 15-min period. Corresponding well to the clinical findings,
EEG pattern changed to a slow delta-theta or delta-only rhythm within 10
min of the start of injection. Alpha and beta power decreased, while delta
activity exhibited an increase. All changes were most obvious in frontal
and central areas of the brain. In about one out of three patients, a
burst--suppression pattern developed. Since automatic processing of EEG
may
fail to detect special patterns like the looked-for 3/s spikes and waves,
the raw EEG was analysed visually by an expert neurologist. Both processed
and conventionally analysed EEG were free of any seizure-like electrical
activity. CONCLUSION. We conclude that animal data may not apply to the
use
of GHB in humans, provided the dose is limited to the clinical needs. GHB
is used in clinical practice in doses twice as high, or even higher, than
the one we use for induction, without obvious side effects. However, the
suppression of theta rhythm we observed in about half of the patients
studied may indicate that even less than 50 mg/kg BW might be sufficient
for adequate sedation. MESH: Abdomen-surgery; Adult-; Aged-; Delta-Rhythm-dr

AB: The first case of fatal intoxication due to ingestion of gamma-hydroxybu

tyric acid (GHB) and intravenous use of heroin is reported. A 42-year-old
man, known to have been a heroin addict and to have taken other
psychoactive substances, who had been in treatment with GHB for several
months, was found dead. Anatomohistopathologic examination showed
generalized visceral congestion, edema and pulmonary anthracosis, chronic
bronchitis and chronic active hepatitis. Toxicological findings included
fluid and tissue distributions of GHB, morphine and 6-monoacetylmorphine.
GHB and morphine concentrations were respectively 11.5 and 0.77
micrograms/mL (blood), 84.3 and 0.3 micrograms/mL (vitreous humor), 258.3
and 1.35 micrograms/mL (urine), 57.0 and 14.3 micrograms/mL (bile), 40.0
and 0.43 micrograms/g (brain), 43.0 and 0.60 micrograms/g (liver), 47.0
and
0.68 micrograms/g (kidney). Blood and urine levels of 6-monoacetylmorphine
were 28.5 and 12.1 ng/mL respectively. The presumed mechanism of action
and
pharmacokinetics of GHB are briefly reviewed, with reference to its
therapeutic use and to reports of non-fatal GHB intoxication. MESH:

AB: A driver was found asleep behind the steering wheel of his car, and
the
vehicle was at rest in a traffic lane with the engine running. His
manifestations included horizontal and vertical gaze nystagmus, muscle
flaccidity, and severe ataxia. He admitted ingesting a white powder, which
he identified as an amino acid, about 1 hour prior to discovery by police.
A urine specimen collected approximately 1 hour after the traffic stop
contained 1975 mg/L of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). We tentatively
conclude
that GHB may cause impairment of the psychomotor skills required for safe
operation of a motor vehicle. MESH: Adult-; Sodium-Oxybate-urine MESH:

AB: Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a drug currently used to treat
narcolepsy. The present study documents its effect on sleep organization
in
healthy subjects. GHB and a placebo were given at bedtime and before a
morning nap in a double-blind fashion. GHB administered before nocturnal
or
diurnal sleep increases stages 3 and 4 and decreases stage 1 non-rapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep. In addition, GHB improves REM efficiency at night
and reduces wake time after sleep onset when administered before a morning
nap recording. GHB also slightly decreases REM latency when administered
in
the morning, and this effect is correlated with age. Hypotheses regarding
mechanisms of action GHB and the involvement of hypothalamic structures in
the regulation of REM sleep are discussed. MESH: Administration,-Oral;

in light of recent goings-ons in chicago and beyond, here's a little
reminder:

big parties = big problems

medium parties = medium problems

small parties = small problems

i've seen all sides of it.  why do so many promoters insist on trying to
be the BIGGEST and the BEST?  i'll take a deep little shindig or a
well-composed medium-sized event any day.  BIG is for like 3 or 4 times a
year, not every 2 weeks.

just thought i would voice that thought.  apparently it hasnt sunk in too
well in the real world.

i have tried to maintain a list of weeklies, but i gave up and still
havent gotten around to removing it from the rom's web page.
what happened was everyone's all gung ho to tell me when events started
up, but forgot to tell me when they folded or moved to another day....  if
someone wants to maintain it, i'll put it at hyperreal off the pb-cle web
page.

sorry i don't have it yet, i'll have it by the next time i'm here.

a few days ago when i came into work there was an intellibeam in an
intellibeam box sitting in the warehouse. i had to ask if it was for
me =] unfortunately it wasn't. that warehouse gets all the shipments
for cedar point since it is the biggest & it was going to the live

anyone that tried to get to the renegade last saturday and came to the west
end bridge; thats just an example how small parties can acrually cause some
big problems (in small pockets of vibe) when promoted big without
logistical foundations such as: power. we needed a generator. the guy ken
skipped town on us. helllO people are so forgetful and unmotivated to
*network* even for a small event. it looked liek the party was promoted
well enough to get 150 -200 people. but had to be skimmed down to 15-20
people at my house.

the good news:: the party is postponed until friday.
dj's TBA

here is another general comment to take elunas lead on perhaps trying to
co-operate without preaching, this may be a lil more cryptic tho ::

keep up with things *people*.
  roll with it *hunny*
    stay on top of things *yo*
      make some good habits if you call yourself part of a culture *sheep*

bad habits simmer down after starting new good ones; such as::
--check out a couple parties with different crews before you dis *or* rave
the fuk out of it
--positively no more than two e pills a month
--definately no more of that candy-nosing around with a fucking straw up
your k filled nostril.

i hope that doesnt rip any person to tears *doubt it will*

peace

	Question....way off when I get outta college a friend and
I want to open a club of our own (just humor me here). :) But,
I'm wondering what people hate the most and love the most
about a clubs.  It's been mentioned that people like to be
able to hear all different styles of music at parties, how would
you best want to see that accomplished? With several separate
rooms? or just 1 or 2 rooms with lots of dj switches.  Should I
even *provide* alcohol? Or does it tend to usually bring in
the wrong type of crowd? Is there a crowd for an all jungle
night (like in Pitt)? cuz there ain't one in clveland now.  Basically
*I* know stuff that *I* wish the couple of clubs would have, and am
looking for others opinions....

	Just dreaming, bare with me,

				brian

yo again.

there is a page up there, but it's very raw.  the net result is that i got about
three responses and haven't had time to sort through the info to put together a
coherent page.  somebody out there really wants to be the information_kingpin,
the person to ask what's what in the two one six.  i know it, i can feel it, i'm
DEFINITELY not it.  now, i mentioned maintaining the page earlier and now it's
even better, if i tell you that all you have to do is send an email to a
[topsecret] address and the info you send shows up as a webpage, wouldja be
interested?  c'mon, alls ya gotta do is know what's going down and type it in,
maybe once a week.  get and keep in touch with club promoters (of ALL crews, not
just your homepeople, include those you may not choose to patronize) and stuff.
it gets you in the scene, it gets other people in the scene, beautiful babies,
honey...it brings beautiful babies wherever you go!!  you're money baby, MONEY.

now get out there and dance.

  When it comes to American Jungle talent, Dieselboy's name is as big as
  they come... despite the fact that he's rather short in person. His
last
  mixed disc, Drum and Bass Selection USA, was the best-selling domestic
  jungle compilation throughout the Winter of 1997. The fanfare that
  surrounded its release included Dieselboy's billing in URB magazine as
  one of the most promising talents in the American electronic scene.
Even
  still, Dieselboy himself was very vocal about his dissatisfaction with
Drum
  and Bass Selection USA, claiming the tracks used for the disc weren't
  exactly his favorites. He vowed that its follow-up would be twice as
good
  and three times as hard. That promise becomes a reality this Summer
with
  the exciting release of '97 Octane.

my ideal club would:
-have polite security and door people
-allow backpacks
-serve alcohol to legal people
-have a larger dance floor than bar and also have a stage 
-book live performances often
-play a variety of styles of music, not just dance music all
 from one sound system throughout the same night
-if it is going to specialize in dance music, the bigger the
 mix of styles, the better
-have video games...lots and lots of video games...one of the main 
 reasons i liked going to cloud 9 in pitt was because i could
 play streetfighter during the house sets
-advertise to attract lots of different people, and not just
 ravers...seems clubs that try to stay underground,,,,go under.

Subject: Re: smileys 


Yes, I am the one who first suggested the use of the :-) and :-( glyphs in
E-mail and bboard posts sometime around 1981.  People were making sarcastic
comments in posts, others were taking them more seriously than they were
intended (no body language on the net), and silly arguments were breaking
out.  So I suggested on one of the CMU bboards that people explicitly label
comments not meant to be serious with a :-) glyph.

Very quickly this idea spread all around the world and others started
creating clever variations on the theme.  The awful term "emoticons" is
much more recent.

Unfortunately, I didn't save the original note.  I post things like this
all the time, and never guessed that this one would make history.

Cheers,
Scott

         THE SMILEY:  A BREAKTHROUGH IN GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS

                           by Don Z'Boray

Because you can't see the person who is sending you electronic mail you are
sometimes uncertain whether they are serious or just joking with you.  About
14 years ago, Scott Fahlman, of Carnegie Mellon University <sef+@cs.cmu.edu>,
devised a scheme for annotating one's messages to overcome this problem.

Tilt your head to the left to look at the arrangement of these three
commonly-used characters

                            :-)

Don't they look like a smiling face?  Thus, if someone sends you a message
that says, "Have you stopped beating your wife? :-) "  -- you know they're
just joking.  If somebody says "I need to talk to you  :-( " -- be prepared
to have a problem shared with you.

The two original glyphs by Scott Fahlman were  :-)  and  :-(

These quickly became known as the "smileys," or "smilies," and somewhat to
Scott's chagrin, emoticons.  Since Scott posted his first smiley proposal,
many other smileys have been devised by many others.  Some smileys have
shorter faces, as in the case of  :(  and  :)

The use of smileys caught on so quickly and spread throughout the world of
online communications with such universal acceptance that only the original
:-)  and  :-(  have a pedigree (see the e-mail letter from Scott, above).

At this point, I would like to say "Thank you" to Scott Fahlman.  Without his
cooperation, this would be just another glyph list.



                     (-:   S M I L E Y S   :-)

                  An Unofficial Guide to Smileys

This is a collection of the variations and mutations of the smiley which I
have collected during my many years of using electronic bulletin boards and,
of course, the Internet.  This article also appears on the World Wide Web,
in an HTMLized page which also serves as a "jumpstation" that gives you the
chance to enjoy an ecclectic link (or three) through the Web to at least one
other Internet resource for almost all of the smileys explained here.

                 The most commonly seen smileys ...

The following examples should help you get your feet wet!  At this time,
I am only showing examples that can be made by using the ASCII characters
common to US-style keyboards.  I will happily expand these pages using the 
ISO-Latin-1 Character Set if I receive some good examples of non-US smileys.
(hint, hint ;-)

:-)     Your basic smiley.  This smiley is used to inflect a sarcastic or
        joking statement since we can't hear voice inflections through text.
        Or, it just might represent how the sender is feeling (happy).

(-:     Your basic southpaw smiley.  Many of the examples in this unofficial
        FAQ can be modified to express that the user is left-handed.
        Some of them, however, cannot be so adapted because of the limits
        of keyboards.

;-)     The "Winky."  This smiley can mean many things, so the context in
        which it is used is important for its interpretation.  Its user may
        havejust made a flirtatious or sarcastic remark.  This can be a type
        of a "don't hit me for what I just said" smiley.  It is often used
        to show remonstration without malice toward the recipient.
        (This is my personal favorite.  I use it in all my e-mail!)


(-;     The left-handed "Winky."

:-(     The frowning smiley (...now *that is* an oxymoron!)  The user is
        disappointed or did not like that last statement and is now
        expressing a pout; or, s/he is anxious, depressed or otherwise
        upset about something.

:-<     "I'm really sad."

%-(     Watch out for this smiley!  Angrily frowning, this one really means
        trouble!

:-I     "I'm indifferent about that" smiley.  Better than a pout but not
        quite as good as a basic smiley.

:->     The user just made a really biting, sarcastic remark - one which
        might require more than a mere  :-)  to help the recipient recover.

>:->    Devilish remark smiley.

>;->    Devilish Winky smiley.
        "The Devil made me do it!" - Flip Wilson



                      Variations ... Mutations ... &c

Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery ...  And Scott's smiley has
certainly been imitated, cloned, mutated, and even abused by others who have
adopted his idea for emoting in their statements in e-mail, submissions to
mailing lists, news articles on Usenet, on pages on the Web, when using
text-based "talkers" (talk, IRC, MOOs and MUDs), and when posting messages
to BBS message subs.  Smileys can be found in printed media - books, and
articles in newpapers and magazines - even when the subject is not about
the Internet!

Now, you might know of some more abusive smileys that do not appear here. 
Cool.  But please do not submit them to me because I just do not care for
them and I use my delete key quite freely  ;-)

TECHNOLOGY - a zine for Pittsburgh area ElectroKulture is looking for dj
top 10's for its next issue (#5)  If you're a dj and wouldn't mind having
your current top-10 tracks in print, send them to gmmst22@pitt.edu.

All I ask is that they be actually you're top 10 tracks, and that you've
spun to some audience (small or big party, the radio, etc) in the past 6
months.  Style is unimportant, though it should be electronic (techno,
industrial, etc.).

If you want to find out more about the zine, email me, or for a copy send
a SASE to: Technology, 1728 East Carson St., Pittsburgh PA 15203.

Sorry for the massive crosspost! :)

I believe an injustice is being done.  If you'll notice, none of the names
and crews (and infoline #s for pete's sake) belong to The Jive Turkeys. 
Being a former Jive Groupey, I can confidently say that an enthusiastic
crew who wanted to work with the Real Turkeys or carry on their name would
be welcomed to do so if they brought their ideas to them, but my inside
sources tell me that this has not happened. 

The Jive Turkeys were a special (and evolving) group of people who really
were around from the beginning.  Many of us have very fond memories of
their off-the-cuff parties.  I'm sure this new group is putting lots of
effort into throwing parties where people will have fun.  But just as
Oasis is not the Beatles, these are not Jive Turkeys parties.

yo domicile beat fanatiks!

you are probably not familiar with cleveland's newestlatest imported jockey of
the wax platters imprinted with deep, deep homestyle grooves, but with my
highest regards, i recommend you do check this honkey out.  Tigger is rather new
in town, based out of louisville he was a key element in revitalizing a scene
that many had said had already had it's day and was on the way out.  a regular
at all of the local clubs (though only Sparks could call him "resident") he
brought sounds from chicago, new york, st. louis, miami, london, and his bedroom
to willing ears all over louisville and the midwest.  now due to circumstances
beyond beats he resides in cleveland and has accepted his first offer for public
appearance:  club GRID on TUESDAYS from 7pm until you can't take no more.

for those of you who may not know, club grid is the only pirate radio station
operating in the cleveland area today on a regular basis, and one of the only
clubs outside of New York to simultaneously broadcast all of their programming
whenever the club is open for business.  finally, Club Grid is the only place to
hear house music no matter what.  fortunately, you do not even have to
physically attend the club to hear some of these fab sounds, tune your frequency
modulated radio to 96.9 MHz and put on your groove.  Tuesdays, after seven
o'clock, and tell 'em [Top Secret] sent ya ;)

	     for booking or conversation, Tigger can be reached at:

				tigger@topsecret.net


thank you for listening,

yo, i was apparrently malinformed.  call the infoline, they still say it's on.
i still say it'll be a DOPE event if it happens.  they were still looking for
spaces as late as last weekend (according to sources), and the issues that would
have prevented the event from happening according to my earlier post are
apparrently more of a nonissue than i thought.

do call the infoline, do NOT miss dj swamp and phantom 45.

sorry for any confusion.

preparty at my place?  hmmm...

========================================================================
Campion and I (ZIG ZAG)
Would like to thank all the people who attended our show last night.
You guys were very receptive to a style of music some are not used to!
Thanks again, We hope we flipped a few of ya out, made the others dance,
and we really hope everyone had as much fun as we did!
Peace & respects,
Stephen Cinch
=========================================================================

curious, yur band's name 'ZIG ZAG', if it had anything to do with the 'zig
zag'
song referered to in ed luna's shpeel on the web on how ele mental came to
be...

from http://ele-mental.coil.com/who/eluna/writings/why.i.rave.html...
=========================================================================

in early 1993 the B/RE cru threw a house party and i showed some nasty old 
stag films on the ceiling. the djs sucked but the party was still great
because
no real dj culture had really developed in columbus, outside of the clubs. so

to hear everyone just faking it was a real great time (all except charles,
who 
had been spinning hip hop since he was like 13). i still didn't feel like i
could 
"stoop" to the level of techno again, "it's a fad," i thought. but then i
heard 2 
songs that really changed my perspective: "zig zag" and "percolator." dude, 
this was _music_. these were minimal little dittys with jazz clips and truly 
innovative sounds... and man, i was hooked. little by little i started
"getting" 
it, i kept finding more and more songs that i "understood." then i understood

that the point of some techno IS to be totally obtuse and relentlessly
repetitve; 
in fact the whole traxx/trance thing really started getting to me. and then
all 
that "busy" stuff, embodied by the new spirit of breakbeat, which at first
had 
almost literally scared me away from techno (!), also made sense. i loved it!

	o.k., if anyone could help me out I'd REALLY appreciate it.
There's this song I've heard like 3 different times at parties that
I really love but I don't know who/what the song is.  It's a 
drum and bass kinda track with horns in the background and
has someone saying "Bigtime" during the refrain....it goes from
a slow hip-hop sound, to drum and bass and back again.

		*brian tries to type out the refrain* (slower part)

duh-dah = the horns...bear with me...:)

"Big Time....duh daaaaaaaaah, duh daaaaaaaah, duh daaaaaah, Bigtime"

.....as you can see I'm desperate :)   any help you can give me would be
GREATLY appreciated!

brian

i doubt it, stevie.  not that it's not possible, but it just seems a lot more
likely that they are naming themselves after a brand of rolling papers.

Hey groove kids, I'm back from SF and ready to hear some real jungle...
unfortunately, I was only able to go to one party (and a shitty club
night that isn't worth mentioning) and that party was all jungle...
I dunno, people out west just don't know how to break out the hardstep
moves... I was one of 3-4 people really working the jungle groove; the
rest of the kids were still in west-coast trance-dance mode...
the djs were pretty good, but not heavy enough on the big beats... also,
I think that all jungle is a little too much for a party (there was only
1 room w/ djs) I like some house or hardcore to break it up in a
night... so the left coast is a little slow to take on the big beats,
but they're starting to get the hang of it
(the other really cool thing about this party, aside from it only being
$8, was that they had a room with a couple of atarii set up... )

Hi,

I've been told by Viktor Mizo that Ruffian has just been added to the line
up at PSYCH O DELIA!  (The party will take place in Erie, PA on Saturday
September 6th.)

Apparently, there will be two rooms to the party -- a Goa Trance room and
a jungle/house room.  Based on the success of his other parties (Land of
Make Believe, Return of Mr. Yumma, ect . . . all the LSD parties in Erie),
I'm sure this will be worth checking out too.

Stevie T forgot to post info on this party with his last listing, so I'm
going to include it here:

This is a track, amazingly, called "Bigtime" by aphrodite.
Its Urban Takeover #3 i think, and is the B-side to "Hype the funk",
another really good rinse-out jump-up hiphip flavored tune.

no swamp.

i never saw alex (the head honcho of 216-BASE), i'm still unsure of his
involvement in this party, so i'm not sure if i blame them for it or not even
though i got direx for it off their vm.

phantom was phenom. per usual.

booty house and drumnbass...it it just cleveland, is it common to mix these two
styles (and strictly these two styles) of music, ignoring the techno, trance,
progressive house, breaks, ambient, acid and minimal genres?  it seems like it's
the only two styles i hear when i go places these days.  but then again, i'm
deaf in one ear.

lotsa ppl there, that sk8park is a cool space, just too big for parties of this
size.  the lights sucked, plain and simple.  that american dj crap equipment are
worse than no lights at all (then again, i prefer it dark).  the sound had too
much highs, and past 1/2way accross the room you heard more refelcted sound than
direct sound from the speakers, but that's not something you can really change
in a room like that, but a little more thought in setup would have probably
helped cut down on it a bit i think.

i've cleaned up and reorganized the pb-cle website with some minor
cosmetic changes, nothing big.  anyhow, if you had any links to stuff
there, in particular images in the pictures section, they have been moved
to a new place in the hierarchy.
i'll be adding new pix soon and if you have photos or scans, please let me
know!  flyers too.  i will be out of classes for the next few weeks until
fall quarter starts so i hope to tinker with photoshop 4 and have some
silly pb-cle animations up and revamp some of the pages.
any ideas, suggestions, or volunteers are welcome.
also about the badges that were discussed awhile back.... i made several
color prints of one of petes from his page, but i havent found anyplace
that does _good_thick_ laminations, there are a few that do thin flimsy
ones, if noone knows of a good place, i'm just going to go ahead and get
the flimsy ones made for whoever wants them .....

i'm really fond of a low-bandwidth option on the site that covers the same
material for text-only browsers and those of us with slow connections.  a lot of
potable design can be done without a lot of graphics.

Hey,

        I hear tell that ATR is going to be at the Wu-Tang and Rage concert.
Can anyone confirm this for me, because I'm going to the how tonight.  I
guess I could just as easily find out at the door, but that would be too
easy.  Well, I hope to hear from someone.

well i'm not making it super grafx intensive, just making the pb-cle logo
animated and making a small grafix header for each section. i might add a
background design also, but it'll be on of several small ( < 15k ) designs
to be used thru the whole site.  the low bandwidth idea has been in place
for awhile.... when you load the picutre pages, it brings up small .jpg
thumbnails rather than the whole huge image,......   
do you think i should make pure text versions for ppl with just the lynx
browser?

Because Alec Empire is doing hte music of ATR. He is one of the best
underground techno musicians, period, and had been around since the
beginning of the acid-party scenes of Germany. He produced some of the
best acid tracks on Force Inc and Analog. His recent stuff as jaguar is
more like Jeff Mills style techno  He has also done hard, distorted
breakbeat, and hardcore-jungle (but he doesn't call it jungle, it's
German breakbeat). Harder than the trancy UK jungle I know most here
listen to, which is not his style and which is why he doesn't use the
amen break (or whatever). Search out the Digital Hardcore website and
the Force Inc website for a list of his records; He's made lots. He's
all the Roland gear but the 707. The ATR sound is not really techno,
more like hardcore; Really it doesn't want to be techno, they want to be
noisy to start a revolution not to make something numbing for the kids
who'd rather down ecstasy and not be aware of what's going on to fight
for their right (read the interviews) As for his production skills, he
has the knowledge of techno, and produces his tracks with the tricks a
true techno-head would know and not a rock-star trying to be electronic,
etc. It's not supposed to be a clean sounded recording either.

There. I just had to drop some knowledge on my favorite techno artists.
As an old fan of Alec Empire and the band, I'm happy to hear ATR getting
the popularity they deserve... I mean, it's so much easier to get their
records now. Not even the underground record stores in New York used to
carry them!

Peace,
Paul/djrome

Hypervinyl. On Oakland & Atwood, go south down Atwood and you'll bump
into it. They carry underground vinyl, though. There's also FutureSounds
but I haven't been there and don't know directions but you can look it
up. Also, Randy's Alternative Music on Southside (East Carson Street)has
a small but okay electronic section.

Stickman basically IS the Jive Turkeyz and his mommy and daddy didnt let
him come out and play or even pay for the flyers for that event which
originated from the heads of him, me,and Eric D and two others from
baltimore. Unfortunately, Ken was out of town and couldnt bring a
generator. I spent the money on flyers and speakers and had the gig
relocated to my house. THe infolines are right and tight, but shamrock
wasnt notified because of lack of involvment (he just wanted to have the
info on his number).

keep some tabs on your scene. your inside sources dont even seem to know

        The jive turkeys, granted, have gone through some reorganization
and people have come and gone, as they usually do. joe187, rick, and other
talents have apparently fallen off the face of the underground. who is left
to collect their memories and redifine their stigma? not many. I have done
what i can; Glen (loki/house of styles/GSP) has done his part. Jon B
(Product 19/House of styles) has done his part. Eric D (L'Dopah) has done
his. Terrel (Double N), Pat Friend, Noah, Murph, Smartie, Ruffian,
Andy/Sine, have all helped us accomplish what we can to bring you dope
music all night to escape all the shit that happens..... much props all the
other many familair faces and happy friends that join us in our
self-evolving shit-happens kind of renegades.
        if you refuse to support them because of a production name that
carries such a stigma, that is your decision; that was fucked up that rick
could not make it to his own party; but we had it anyway. IT was fucked up
that InMotion could not happen, but we had it anyway. This shows that there
IS an ethic of sticking to things in the pittsburgh clean up crew; too bad
nobody sticks to the plan of actually attending their dope ass events... 

it was moved, after lots of waiting in vain and dispute, to the renegade
location under the west end bridge. Kim's garden found some skater graffiti
on the front door after interstellar groove and found it in their best
interest to stop having us give them business. they thought it was some

Stigma?  Well, that's _your_ opinion...And it's _YOUR_ thing.

As for at least Joe falling off the face of the underground, that's funny. 
Because it seems that every other time I turn on Radio Carson, I hear one
of his dubplates... 

And as for Rick, I had a good conversation with him the other night.  He,
like a lot of us, are watching and waiting for a new level of depth.

Steve,

I work for channel 8 news in Cleveland and I'm working on a story
involving a drug called Ketject. The street name of this drug Super K.
If there is a web page or anything anywhere on the Web that you know of
where we may find some information for our story. Or if you know of
anyone who takes this drug, I would love to hear what you have to say.
We would like to talk to them if we could. We would protect their
identities of course and keep any information that they gave us in
strict confidence. There was some of this drug stolen from some
veterinarians in the area, and we're wondering why its so popular. From
my information it produces a psychedelic effect. But why not just use
Acid or some other form of Hallucinogen. Any information you can send my
way would be greatly appreciated... Please feel free to call or E-mail
me if you can help me out.... thanks...

=======================================================================

i told him i couldn't really help him out, but would forward it to the
list...please respond to him (eensign@ix.netcom.com) and not me...

i suddenly realised that i forgot to (re) introduce myself to this list...
so here goes...

my name is Costas, and i'm originally from ny city... but i've been
subscribing to this list since April (the first topic that i heard talked
abt was the whole 4/20 thing) because it looked as though i would be in
pittsburgh for the next 4 years... i am a freshman at CMU...  and i had
come up to visit the weekend of 4/20 .. so i wanted to know abt any parties
in the area... so i did an internet seek... pittsburgh raves... and all of
a sudden i run into something called pb-cle raves... and i've been here
ever since... i never really posted much b/c i dont know all that much abt
the scene here in pittsburgh (or cleveland) but once in a while there are
things like MTV and [rave] culture... and things like kandy raves suck....
to which i couldnt help but coment...

anyway, since i live here now... and ssince i have no fucking clue abt
pittsburgh... (every time i feel like venturing out into oakland...it
starts to rain)

i was gonna go to the rage concert... b/c atr was there.. but it was
raining and i wasnt gonna go sit on wet grass... (how was that btw???)

so thats my story... i'm kinda excited to be here... something new is
always nice... u know? ... something abt most clubs shutting down at 2 am
scares me... but then again... there is always the afterhours shit....

galve.

hi :)  due to the fact that the upcoming week and a half or so is going to
be ridiculously hectic for me, i'm taking it upon myself to unsub from
these rather high-traffic lists.  i'm going to try to cut back on my vrave
time and limit myself to one email session per day til i get moved (a whole
2 blocks :P)  and get my life back on track (the computer has a way of
sucking me in, vrave in particular).  anyone who wants to reach me can do
so at allroy@topsecret.net, and if anyone who knows me well sees anything
they think i'd be particularly interested in, do please forward it :)
hopefully be talking to y'all again in a couple weeks...

may all your dreams be wonderful,

no it wasnt. The Down Low was Rick's party.That's what i was trying to

radio 91.7 hardly ever plays jungle.. it plays "electronica" and i doubt
anyone at that station uses dubplates.. they use Hi8 film, maybe some
cassettes, some vinyl, some Cd's ..I know Joe went to philly and is off to
many great things within the music industry, but that by know means
qualifies him as an inside source to the rave scene, especially the
pittsburgh one.

that's pretty convienient... just wait for something else to happen and
decide whether or not to take credit for being there.. you ARE a typical
raver despite what you might like to realize.. We have had two renegades
since the Down Low happened in case you havent noticed, one by L'Dopah and
one by Double N, so you can calm down about us using the jive turkeyz
production name, okay?

Well hello there... I don't know if any of you out there on this list are 
going to know/remember me... but I thought I'd introduce myself since I 
resubscribed yesterday after being away from Pittsburgh for approximately 4 
months.

My name's Marcus Kish... aka proby on the net.  Don't ask, it's not scary, 
but it's a dork explanation.  Anyway... I lived in Pittsburgh all my 
life... right outside of Fox Chapel... and no, not the snotty rich area, so 
:P  Dorseyville, actually, if any of you know where that is... although not 
too many people do.  So... March 10th I moved out here to Philadelphia... 
land of the hardcore G-Money mack-daddy wannabe gangsta punk ass bitches 
who stand around trying to look cool and have way too much K in their 
systems.  

So anyway... as I was saying.  Let's see... my last Pittsburgh party was, 
um... That Thing... which I didn't really wanna go to considering I hated, 
hate and will continue to hate Eric Candyman 
what'shisfacechildmolestingpunkassbitchloserfreakboy... but, I will admit, 
I did have a great time at that party... but since then I haven't had a 
chance to get to any other parties back home being that I'm carless and I 
prefer going to parties in Baltimore and DC over Pittsburgh parties... even 
though the scene in Pittsburgh is a lot tighter, I feel, than those cities. 
 However, I like the music in DC/Baltimore a little better... Pittsburgh 
has a lot of hip-hop at parties, which I'm not into whatsoever.  It's hard 
to say what my favorite kind of techno is, because I like just about 
everything... ambient, jungle (jump up/hardstep), trance, hard house, 
gabber, hardcore, minimal, breaks, goa... and one thing that I don't miss 
about Pittsburgh is the fact that I didn't go to that many parties out 
there that supported a LARGE variety of techno... I never understood why.  
:/  Oh, well.

Anyway... I saw mention of Joe and Rick's names in a couple posts... Joe 
has so NOT fallen off the face of the underground... whoever said that... 
that's so not even right.  Whoever said that deserves to be pimpslapped so 
hard.  :P  So eat it lick it stick it pick it rah rah rah ack stack pack 
mack track.  PAECE.

Just to warn you guys... I post a lot. 
I'm bored.  I'm tired.  I have Mt. Dew.  

Look out.

 - marcus straightedge dork proby boy new to pb-cle-raves once again.
 (ugh I hope this list has improved since I was subscribed last time 3 
years ago).

Ok, people, obviously Pete and i are having a small tiff.  I wont' subject
you to the gory details, but in case anyone was curious...



)radio 91.7 hardly ever plays jungle.. it plays "electronica" and i doubt
)anyone at that station uses dubplates.. they use Hi8 film, maybe some
)cassettes, some vinyl, some Cd's ..I know Joe went to philly and is off to
)many great things within the music industry, but that by know means
)qualifies him as an inside source to the rave scene, especially the
)pittsburgh one.


Not true.  Radio carson plays a healthy amount of jungle, but it also
plays a lot of house, techno, everything.  I've even heard some kind of
experimental something that i don't think has a hard and fast title.
Mark, who runs the station plays a lot of house because that's what he
gets the most requests for.  He has live DJs every Saturday night and
tapes the sets onto 6 hour video tapes for continutity and sofor the rest
of the week he doesn't have to babysit the station every minute.  Radio
Carson also plays mixtapes and CDs, but in fact, many a dub has been spun
and Atom even did a live techno set the other week.  I saw him in front of
his buttons and knobs with my own 2 eyes.  As far as the live
performances on Saturdays, lots of different people have shown up from
well-known people in the Pittsburgh scene to beginners.  It tends toward
the lower-key DJs, in the trenches, in the underground.  

I give Mark maximum respect for running a station with a clear ideal in
mind, and carrying it to fruition with grace and economy.  Radio Carson is
on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, almost %100 of the time.  That's as
reliable if not more than WRCT at Crnegie mellon, and TONS better than
WPTS at pitt.  (not to slight the good DJs at pitt, but the policies are
wacky.)  The atmosphere is open, mature and friendly, there's good
discussion without the, ehem, stigma, of negative conflict and it's a darn
good time. 

And Joe did not go to Philly.  In fact, he is in Squirrel hill this very 
minute.  As for his place in the scene or the world, It is neither
your place nor mine to make those kinds of judgements.  I will leave it up
to him to explain himself if he thinks it's that important.  But if I were
in his situation (and to some extent i am) I would resent having my
personal life and choices about how I spend my precious time, put up on an
overhead projector for hundreds of people to flippantly critique.

Also, if the party was Rick's party, and he's the strongest link you had
to The Name, it's pretty disrespectful to talk about him the way you did
oin your last post, especially to do so pubicly when he has no immediate
recourse.  That's just not fair.
 
) that's pretty convienient... just wait for something else to happen and
)decide whether or not to take credit for being there.. you ARE a typical
)raver despite what you might like to realize.. We have had two renegades
)since the Down Low happened in case you havent noticed, one by L'Dopah and

Great.  Renegades are lovely.  I have much respect for poeple who throw
them, especially if they are successful.  More power to anyone who runs a
pirate, throws renegades, makes tracks, anything creative.

It's boorish to shove a false label on a person as though it's an
accusation, espcially if the accusation is at the expense of everyone who
hears it.  It's like going into a Special Needs program and calling
someone a retard. It's that kind of stuff that pushed me out of the things
I was into before i started going to parties, and it's what's pushing me
away from traditional parties now.  I dont' feel like I fit in anymore and
that's ok.  Ravers are a special type of people.  when I think of ravers I
think of very giving, sharing, spontaneous people who love to have fun and
meet new people.  I, on the other hand, am fairly serious, cautious by
comparison, not good at talking to strangers, and pretty practical.  I
have other stuff going on, tstuff that fits my personality and my beliefs
better, so I wouldn't be so presumptuous as to call myself a raver, even
though a lot of the culture is still something i find interesting and fun. 

The scene is going through some serious growing pains and people leaving
the either philosophically or otherwise doesn't help, but people are
gonna do what they're gonna do.  I'm not as stimulated as I once was and
life is too short to try to patch things up that aren't even me.  So I'm
looking ahead and I'm not the only one.  I did my part for the rave scene
when I had the passion to carry me through.  But now I'm doing my part in
carving a tunnel ahead. It may seem like I'm a traitor or something, but I
don't see it that way.  I've always done what i thought was real and
creative.  There is absolutely nothing real or creative about being yelled
at especially when the things being yelled are totally uninformed and just
plain wrong.  I'm through with getting my information from my opinions. 
now i get my opinions from the information i get and the emotions it
brings on.

And so I'm putting my scarce free time into finding exactly what it is
that's capturing my imagination and curiosity.  If it actually gels into
something a bit mre tangible i'll be thrilled to have been part of giving
like-minded people the opportunity to find something of the piece that
_they've_ been looking for too.  I'm not focusing my energies elsewhere to
say I was into the next big thing, I'm doing it because it's the only
natural choice.  In five years, if nothing happens and i'm doing some
boring whatever job I'll have at some company, I won't regret it because
I'm meeting interesting people from whom i can learn a lot.  I'm not
comfortable being complacent, and complacent is all i can be in an
environment where i can't find my role.

And.this.kind.of.shite.doesn't.help.

Where in the hell do you get your "information?"  Re: joe, what do you
know about his major professionsal success?  Apparently empty rumors.  And
how do you think he got to whereever he is in "the industry?"  Could it be
that he was around for the very first party ever in Pittsburgh?  Could it
be that he promoted for Deadly Buda?  Could it be that he has been there
watching the scene go up and down from the beginning, and now chooses the
parties he goes to carefully because, as almost any old-schooler you ask
will tell you, it's just not as fun as it used to be?  Could it be that if
there's a REALLy underground party, like a Projekthaus party, an Ed Ummmm
party, or a night at, you guessed it, Radio Carson, he's there?  Could it
be that he started the very list you're using to flame him?  And perhaps
he was even one of the original members of Time Bomb, which was a band
before it was a store, and he helped do the timebomb piece in the East
Busway?  And that's just a few of the tings he did toward the beginning.
Since then he has been steadily making tunes and actually putting a
surprisingly low emphasis on his professional career.  It's only very
recently, we're talking the last few weeks, that he decidded he should
probably think about getting himself out there, if for no other reason
than there's no use in wasting all the hard work he';s put in when it
could just as easily FINALLY pay for itself.


I can't figure out where your head is or why you put it there.  Are you
going to be at Steel City?  I would like to talk to you and finally get
out all the misunderstandings as well as common ground because all this is
really making me angry.  By the way, I did reply to one of your older long
personal posts, but the reply was very long, I was almost done, then
someone picked up the phone and broke my connection.  I didn't have the
time or energy to redo it.

pete, im gonna try and not come down on you *too* hard for this one...



a)- HARDLY EVER? thats a matter of opinion.. hunh.. every tiem i put it on

there a really good chance im gonna hear jungle...



b)- how many times have u spun on 91.7? how many times have u been down to

the station.. i bet ya my rommates stephanie and joe187 have done both more

than you.. nothign beats first hand knowledge...



im gonna take a step back for a second pete.. i dont know you... i have

nothing PERSONALLY against you.. it jsut seems at times that u like to

spout off on subjects that u dont really have expert knowledge of, that can

be a dangerous thing and it will coem back to haunt you...





now, on with the business..



joe not an 'inside source'? come on now...here's another case of you
talking
out of your ass, but joe is around, and speak for himself...(no he hasnt

moved to philly yet...u gotta check your sources mate...) 



where were you in 91/92? definitely not going to the first proto-raves here

in town...a summer of involvement doesnt qualify you for 'founding father'

status ;)  and it doesnt make YOU an inside source...



i mean i see this shit all the time, where everyone thinks they are the 

be-all, end-all of the rave scene.. it just aint possible...even an 

'authority' like matthew collins (check 'altered state' by serpent's tail 

press--a very thorough examination of the uk rave scene) concedes that 

there are so many different perspectives and opinions that you CAN NOT 

have an authoritative answer for almost anything in the scene.



thats all for now, ive been on my 'lunch break' for almost 2 hrs now...;) 




see you all at scj tonite.. it promises to be WICKED ..nice weather, all
the pitt students are back in, come out and show your support.. its only $5
to get in... and the guest dj is mogli from cincinnati....


peace,
hossam

pete, pete, pete. i go alla way to miami and stay subbed to pb-cle for
*this* shit? i have never ever run into you at radio carson, where myself,
farmer tea, 187, and stephanie spent many a saturday, spinning _jungle_
sets, using _dubplates_.... the sets that were *taped* and replayed at
various times during the week. get it? jungle? dubplates? radio carson?
your obvious lack of involvement, hence inability to comment knowledgably?

as far as the dissing of joe187, you've gotta be kidding me. to say that
joe is not an insider in the rave scene is like saying that krs-one has
nothing to do with hip-hop. joe, who resides in pittsburgh, btw., has been
one of the major influences in my love and involvement with jungle. how
are you gonna say that a producer has nothing to do with the rave
scene???? people only jam out to his massive live sets...ya dig?? 

and as far as the dissing of steph.. it's just stupid. you need to stop.
she has hella lot more insight into things than you will ever have.. 

i'm sorry- i've really tried to be nice and fair with you, but you've done
too many little things to piss me off...

you just need to be better informed before spouting that little mouth of
yours off. 
hell- i'm alla way across the damn country and i know more about the
scene...arrrgh.

As of today, I have recieved 5 - 6 calls about me using a booking agent.
THIS IS A RUMOR! I DO NOT USE ONE!
If anyone would like to book me, just call the Beat Corperation  office
  at 216.605.0454.
I will always take my own bookings, unless there comes a time when it just
isn't possible for me to do so any longer.

Welcome back! Just to clarify: That Thing was run by Leno (Holdsome
Productions).  Candyman is Phillip Dye, not Eric D, and cannot take credit
for that party. He has, on several occasions however, managed to throw some
dope ass events in pittsburgh, one of which grossed the biggest attendence
ever.

everytime i turn on 91.7 i hear some house shit.. but you know i dont make
a religion about listening to the radio so im gonna back the fuk up on this
one and let everyone else tiff.
 I dont really care if radio carson spins jungle OR uses dubplates. I
assumed that the guys there arent that stupid and it would be stupid to
spin dubplates for a radio station. i dont give a hoot about who fucking
represents pittsburgh's rave/type music scene because the music is a
completely different matter than the scene. the music influences the scene
and the scene influences the music, but they are on two completely
different levels.  There are many rising talents and those are who i focus
my energy on, not the ones that have already risen, because the ones at the
top of the stairs usually don't know the down low, as the lurkers
(outkasts) should know (the ones at the top can't even see the bottom so
they can't see what im saying is correct and direct from the underground)

i also dont give a flying fuck how long youve been in the scene. i'm sick
of people thinkin theyve got the inside shit cuz theyve been around longer
and know the heads that have been around longer. i'm sick of rumors coming
back to me about stupid shit that aint even true; and most of all i'm sick
of people trying to make an event so difficult to plan out like you need to
know this amount of people or this amount or kind of dj's.. fuck all
yall... throwing raves is about giving people something to do so they arent
bored.. you just need some speakers, some turntables, some records and
youre set dood...your fucking set.

yall are proabbly friends with joe, so youre biased and i should back the
fuck up on that one too, but shit you have to start getting less defensive
when it comes to his whereabouts. Alls i was trying to say is that he aint
really been around the streets of oakland or the clubs with all the
underground sets. i dont really matter what city your in, its how you
represent, and i fucking represent them more than most of you.. if yall are
supposed to be founding fathers why arent you schoolin kids in the scene?.
see unlike you i actually care about heads that cant find jobs and live in
our community because of who they naturally are; hip-hop/rave schooled kids
that are who they are and their personalities (not their products or
possessions) get them to where they have to be.

yO go listen to the radio station some more and tell me thats not the
cheesiest house youve ever heard.  Bob T the sound guy spins better shit
than that. dont even try to flame me either cuz you should know by now that
i love to argue.

to reply to amie:

tapes and dub plates are different. im not doubting that you guys have
experience using dubplates, but i will say that any radio station using
real dubplates (unless they have a machine for it) are wasting their money.
the dubplates im talking about can only be played acouple times because the
grooves get ruined by needle cuz they are really really thin. dubplates are
for *performing* (as in an audible and visual "presence"), not recording or
broadcasting (in general of course). pressing dubplates is something
founded by recording artists turned dj's, as means of convenient
reproduction on _vinyl_ not magnetic tape.  no ive never been to radio
carson but my friend went to his house when it was at his house and he was
using hi8 tapes to record and replay shit, not dubplates. if yall are using
it for a recording studio, good deal, but whats that have to do with the
pittsburgh rave scene?? nada.

S'up?

	The misinformation quoted above was forwarded to me for comment, 
so let me say something of dubplates, 'cause i have a few. y'know :-)
First off, dubplates can be played *many* times.  I know that the rumor 
is that they wear out after only a couple of plays, but that's just not 
true ... if you use good needles and treat the plates with care, they 
will last for a good long time.  My friend Bubbles, who is a dancehall 
DJ, has dubplates from NY and JA that are over 4 years old, and he still 
plays them on occasion (o.k., so they're a little hissy by now, but still 
playable).

	Now, about playing dubs on the radio ... OF COURSE PEOPLE PLAY 
DUBPLATES ON THE AIR!!  Haven't you ever heard a set from a UK radio 
station?  I have many many tapes from Grooverider, Fabio, JJ Fost etc who 
have been on UK radio for years now, and every one of those tapes has 
dubplates on them.  The reason for pressing dubplates is to test a song 
out.  The best way to test a song for large amounts of people is to play 
it on the air, and hope that people call in and give a response to the 
tune. 

	So, anyways ... I don't know what's up with Pittsburgh radio 
these days, but in the past dubplates were spun for good reason on 
RadioCarson, WPTS-FM and WRCT-FM.  As for the tape part, yeah, Mark at RC 
uses VHS decks to record his week-end sets for use in re-broadcasting.  
This is a very common technique in undergroud radio for archiving 
performances.  The reason for this is that a VHS tape can record 6 hours 
or so of continuous music, at a quality good enough for FM transmission, 
for relatively low cost.

I'm happy to answer any more questions, just address them to me at my 
addy so I get the post.

l8rs ... i miss yinz,
Toby

Nice Dream Team reference.  One of my favorites. :)

Some info on dubplates...

)tapes and dub plates are different. im not doubting that you guys have
)experience using dubplates, but i will say that any radio station using
)real dubplates (unless they have a machine for it) are wasting their money.

Dubplates get spun on Radio Carson because RC broadcasts live sets and
live performaces, as though the DJs are, in fact, doing a show.  DJs on
Kiss FM and Kool FM and mad pirates in the UK use dubplates on their
shows.

)the dubplates im talking about can only be played acouple times because the
)grooves get ruined by needle cuz they are really really thin. dubplates are

The Great Grooverider says he generally gets up to 50 plays out of a
plate.  I know people who have played their plates 100 times or more.
Granted, they're not made for scratching, but if you treat them well, they
will do the same for you.

)for *performing* (as in an audible and visual "presence"), not recording or
)broadcasting (in general of course). pressing dubplates is something
)founded by recording artists turned dj's, as means of convenient
)reproduction on _vinyl_ not magnetic tape.  no ive never been to radio

Dubplates are made of acetate.

)carson but my friend went to his house when it was at his house and he was
)using hi8 tapes to record and replay shit, not dubplates. if yall are using
)it for a recording studio, good deal, but whats that have to do with the
)pittsburgh rave scene?? nada.

Well, hi8 is a new kind of video tape.  They are usually not used for
audio.  Mark uses stereo hi fi vhs video tapes to tape live sets, because
you can get 6-8 hours worth of stuff on them.  He puts stuff on tape
because he has a REAL JOB and that is the only practical way to run the
station and maintain autonomy.

As someone who is just got started in the carpentry scene, ya know, I'm
really down low in the underground, I feel a need to speak my mind.  I see
people using hammers to tighten joints between pieces of wood, to pull
nails out of wood, and even to loosen nuts.  This is misrepresenting the
scene and I resent it.  Hammers are meant to be used for banging in nails,
period.  Seeing as hammers are made of tin, this is the only practical and
real use.  Use tools only for what they were intended to do.  Creativity
only breeds impurity.

Oi! I have to agree on this one.  Not that most raves aren't cliched, but
this takes the cake.  It sounds like the name of a show on UPN:

"Zena, Raver Princess: The Beginning of a Legendary Mind Blowing Experience"

And on top of that, its almost all house, which is all swell and good, but
not exactly mind-blowing.  Ok...I don't want to get into a rip session. :)

BTW:  In case anyone is forgetting, this SUNDAY is "THE NOTHING",
which is mostly jungle and hiphop, with also some abstract/experimental
beats in the lounge.  Should be quite good.  I'll be there definitely.

Do they contain music?

Are they spinnable?

Does the music on them make it worth it?

Let me answer that last one, though:  Most of the time.

What is the drek coming down about tapes?!?

I reiterate:  Are they spinnable?

Then, why argue?

Here's my [not so good] news for those of you who care... the other day,
(yesterday) i spilled milk on my laptop, and it no longer functions as
it should .. (everything works fine.. except a few buttons on the
keyboard)... so its basically out of order.. (i'm sending it back to the
company to get it fixed... (although they told me i would probably have
to pay for the damage b/c, after all, i [told them that i] spilled the
milk on the computer, so it is my fault it doesnt work... anyway... this
sucks, b/c i no longer have a computer with-which i can check my mail
very often... being in school, we do have computers, but i dont have all
my shit on this machine... (ie all your e-mail addys and stuff)... i can
still check my mail, but some of u have given me phone # and i dont have
them written down.. (for the most part anyway) ... they are all in my
computer... unfortunately, its on its way to texas as we speak...

so this has (as u can immagine,) made me very sad and depressed... i am
feeling very out of touch w\ all u dudes... and all the others who arnt
on this list (but i dont have their addy's to write to them)

so, if u are expecting a little love note from me and havnt gotten it
(or dont get it soon) dont feel unloved... i havnt forgotten about u...
i am just in the midst of some pretty shitty technical difficulties...

all my love... oh yea... enjoy labor\memorial day weekend... (which is
it by the way???) ...gotham city is this sunday no?? [i wish i could be 
there...] ... oh and to everyone in pittsburgh .. come to Amnesia this
Sat... (have u dudes heard abt this one???)

galve.


ps... hey Snoop!!!!!!

this is a formal note of apology for my recent display of ignorance and
rudeness on a list dedicated to _discuss_  rave-related issues and events;
not cause rumors rucus and rampage as i realize now that i have done, after
calming down a little. Im' glad i did learn that dubplates are and how they
could be (personally) pretty handy, among other useful information about a
certain radio station.

IN any event i'd like to see anyone who can make it to THE NOTHING tonite.

oh so so far i've been to 2 parties here in Pittsburgh and all in all i
think the scene in pittsburgh is very cool... although its much
different than what i'm used to as a new yorker... but if the amount of
fun i'm having is ANY indication at all, then the Pitt scene is
excellent...

the first, and perhaps most important difference between pitt and new
york is the music... i was at this spot called laga which does this
byweekly event called SteelCityJungle... and as the name suggests the
lineup was entirely joungle... which is ok i guess if you are a big fan,
but i am not that... i have grown to like joungle... in fact sometimes i
find myself spending 90% of my time in the joungle room... but that
night, listening to 4 hours of continuous joungle took its toll...
although the  music was very good... (i had no idea regarding the dj's
spinning ability.. but i'm happy to say that i thought they did very
well...

last night i went to something called Amnesia... it was at this dude
Dan's house who i met at the previous party... although i had trouble
finding the spot... i did manage to get there around 2... (i walked from
my campous... a very LONG walk, i might add...) anyway.. i walk in, and
all of a sudden there is TRANCE in the "main room" <----dan's living
room... and the dj.. wh just introduced himself to me as "Jason" was
excellent... (i love the music.. so maybe i am biased... but dude was
tareing shit up....) he doesnt spin professially, (so he was spinning
for free) but he told me that he only spins as a hobby in the privacy of
his own home... or for friends.... this party had another room
upstairs.. unfortunately, there was hip-hop/house comming from the
generall area.. plus, for some strange reaason there was STEAM all over
the room... (and of course there was a bugout room)

i've met a lot of pretty cool people here in Pitt... but some of the
[ravers] are different from [ravers] in NY... it seams like people arnt
friendly, they are certious... but not friendly... at some point i was
thinking that people were just "nice" because [ravers] have to be... u
know the whole plur thing... i think being "nice b/c u have to be is
totally wacked... 

it seams that most people are not quick to accept u.. the scene is
small, and it includes people who dont "look" like [ravers] (then again,
one could argue that there is no look....although i'm sure u know what
i'm talking abt...) most people there are close friends or at leas know
each other well... i was one of the few new faces... and, its true, i am 
still a stranger... and maybe that doesnt help... but its never been a
problem for me in NY... that is the biggest adjustment i will have to
make in this town...

another important passitive difference in Pitt is the amount of money i
have spent... had i been in ny i would have payed $30+ to go to the 1st
party..and $10 - 15 depending on how shady the dude throwing the party
was...) i have payed $5 for the 1st paty and $3 for the second... pretty
cool huh???

tonight there is a party in a "club"... something taht i am more used to
as a new yorker... but i am WAY too tired for that shit... so i wont
go...(i believe its called THE NOTHING btw...for those of u who have
heard of it) ...so i donth think i'm gonna attend...

anyway.. i've rambled on long enough... but b4 i forget.. if u were at
Laga this past Tuesday, i was the dude w\ the glow-in-the-blacklight
fingernails... (its the nailpolish!!)

and yesterday... at AMNESIA i had black jnco's and a small polo sport
messenger bag tipe thing...


enjoy NOTHING or GothamCity if u do choose to attend... (i think GCity
is gonna be increadible.. and i wish i could go...) 


all my love.

Costas. \ galve.
