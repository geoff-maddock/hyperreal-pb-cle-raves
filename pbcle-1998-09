>      'bunny goes raving'

Speaking of which, has anyone seen "Sam&Max", only THE best cartoon in the
world?  I'm talking Freelance Police, here.  With their brain in the
drain, kid scientist 'the Geek' they track down villains and the
occasional Friend for Life.  One's a rabbit that doesn't wear any clothes,
except for the occasional drag get-up.  One's a big floppy-eared dog that
wears a big great suit.  Lots of adult humor disguised as a children's
show.  The only problem is the stupid network.  Every other week, they
program a different show for the "S&M" time slot.  Very frustrating.  Damn
Fox!  Everyone should tune in at 11:30 on Saturday morning in Pittsburgh.
Check local listings elsewhere.  Then you'll see.  I'll show you!

Rock on my sister!  Definitely a top cartoon, and my favorite Sat morning
one.  If you don't already know, its based on an adventure type (think
maniac mansion, etc) computer game (and maybe a comic before that...??).
If you haven't played this game - get it!  By far my favorite game of that
type, really cool animation and interactivity and its got the same off the
wall hilarity...it should cost something like $3 now because its like 4
years old.

I can't decide where to go this weekend.  
Anyone with an extra carspace able to convince me to tag along?  
(ha-ha...evil get-a-ride scheme phase one completed!)

if *ANYBODY* in the pittsburgh area has an extra seat (or trunk, or
floorspace) and is heading down to liquid this weekend, i am desperately
looking for a ride.

i haven't been to a party since intergalactic circus and i need to go to
one soon... i miss my pb-cle kids sooooo much. : <

anyway, if you don't know me, i'm lots of fun to hang around, *grin* and
i'll definitely bring lots of candy (blow pops, pop rocks, assorted
other goodies), whistles, money food food and gas and tolls, and lots of
music if you want me to. also, i can provide a place for us to chill
while we're down there...

i live in oakland (i go to school down at cmu) but if you need me to
meet you somewhere, i can most likely do it...

well, thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out. *crossing
fingers*


peace,

--spike

I can totally  vouch for Spike.  In the morning when you're all ready to
go, or really anytime, I guess, you can squeeze him and squeeze him!  He
gets this look on his face like he's giggling inside!  Try it, and see.

Don't waste your time.  This is definitely a scam....a news station 
called Disney and Bill Gates for verification, both said it was a hoax.

Whoa.  I just saw the weirdest commercial.  It was a public service
announcement.  It was about "meth".  Rather, about why you shouldn't use
it.  Not that I'm saying people shouldn't use it, ummm...anyway, it was
this crazy little jingle like on a Sprite commercial.  It had this little
pixie girl with a little pixie cut running around cleaning her apartment
with a toothbrush and then at the end she was scratching her skin off and
pulling hair out of her body.  The song said things like 'I don't know why
I have all this energy' and I just need more meth and stuff like that.  At
the end it went to a white background with an red oval with the word
"meth" inside.  The chorus kept singing "meth".  It was really odd.  Sort
of catchy.

      had this big blue e with a little thing orbiting
      round it, you know, and at the end they said,
      'where do you want to go today?' it was trippy.
      i think it was sponsored by microsoft.

      <giggle stupidly>

      on a similar note, the u. of pitt. now has an
      'e-store'. http://e-store.pitt.edu

      i thought it was amazingly funny. go there. i
      want a job at that place...

	it all makes me wonder: what if e, meth, pot, crack, etc

	Interesting choice of names yes.  I'd never buy my e there though.
	A bit overpriced for what you get.

	One a music note: just picked up a cd "On the wires of our nerves"
	by Add N to X...its some excellent stuff...blends a quirky almost
	kraftwork-melencoly stlye of tones with some chunky beats and 
	jungly tech beats...one tune is like acid rock with dark jungle 
        basslines...its got way more of a unique sound than i can

	synth into some girl on an operating table...

     [warning - long disconnected ramble follows, 
      ignore if you hate that mind-expansion sh*t]

     for some reason, the scheduling messed up, and
     i'm alone on the graveyard shift, midnight to
     eight. coming down (don't ask) alone in the
     computer lab, with literally nobody to talk to
     but the wires and a cold glass screen, i have
     plenty of time to ponder the universe.

     <wry smile>

     and, pondering, i find that there are a lot of 
     things i still don't understand. i'm trying to
     consolidate what i've learned this summer, the
     transition from career engineer and hardcore
     geek to film major and hardcore raver, and what
     happened in between.

     lance arthur says there is no death. he says it's
     something like when you turn off the TV, just
     cold quiet electric blackness and no more 9 to 5,
     no more new car, new house, new VCR, every five
     years. just... nothing.

     but is there? if there isn't anything - then what
     are people working towards? if this is all there
     is, then why waste your time working towards some
     vague pretentious educational goal in the hope
     of earning more money that will allow more inches
     on your TV or perhaps leather instead of cloth
     in your dodge stratus?

     what precipitated this email was an ad on the 
     radio, some goofy (but actually very well-done)
     spot about the dangers of pot [gasp] and how it
     will turn you into a small-town slacker. 

     perhaps there is some value in staying straight-edge,
     for at least the early part of your education. i
     mean, i can babble on about sodium-vapor lamps and
     centripetal force while tripping and wierd out all
     my friends... 

     but my repressed child-hood is just going to get
     me into trouble. one extreme just results in 
     another.

     but i have learned something, i think. there is a
     strange spirituality in the shared happiness of a
     rave that in all my years immersed in religion i
     never quite experienced.

     well, there's one thing i DO know. if there isn't any
     death, nothing after the last heartbeat, then where
     better to be than the rave scene? spending life living
     at 200%, searching for that last ounce of serotonin,
     that plateau of consciousness where all will be 
     revealed...

     sorry for the babble, i'm lonely/bored. ignore as
     appropriate.

     pluR

well, in my opinion, being alive is based on knowing youre alive and the 
communication of feelings/emotions....thus if you go insane, or become 
detatched somehow from your body, what good are you? expanding your 
feelings and consciousness can only lead you farther away from your real 
thoughts... when you no longer have real thoughts or emotions, or no 
longer can share express them with anyone, you may as well be 
dead......as whatever "higher knowledge" you may have gained is all just 
bullshit to everyone else

strangely, i've thought about these questions for many moons now (well, 
since last summer) and have to agree wholeheartedly with you.  i have 
never felt more comfortable or gotten as much enjoyment in just living 
as i do now because of the scene... even if it's just helped me say hi 
to ppl easier or smile faster in the face of conflict.  BLAH BLAH BLAH 
BLAH
anyway...
all i'm sayin is, hallelujah and amen brother.

yeah...

when i was in germany the summer before last there was this kick-ass
ad about ecstacy. first it showed a wind-up monkey (you know... w/
cymbals that hit together). then someone wound it up sorta slowly and
about 2 seconds later it started goin - over the next 4-5 seconds it
got faster and faster and they had these crazy visual effects from the
monkey's standpoint (more like bein on acid, really, but...) quickly
zooming to outside shots of the monkey goin buck-wild stompin around
(oh yeah... some techno music was playing to). this went on for like
10 seconds to a shot from above and *timestandsstill* the monkey falls
off the edge of the table and is slowly falling thru space till he
hits the ground and breaks into a bunch of little pieces. they zoom in
on his still happy face, and then a german guy says something like
"ecstacy nine funtasy" (i dunno... i just remember seeing/hearing the
word "funtasy").

it was a effective commercial, really. i think they might have been
airing it because the love parade was the following week. 

HEY! anyone else comin' to LOVE PARADE 2000 w/ da RSP?

I've thought about that every once in awhile and have come to basically two =
conclusions/hypothetical answers...number one, if you can actually compare=
 dying to going to sleep in more than just a grand metaphorical way, then=
 maybe when you die it's just like going to sleep in that you no longer have=
 any conscious feelings about it..ie you're dead, but how would you know,=
 you're brain's not really on to think about it, so why would you give a=
 shit?  you're just dead, case closed.  there's no regret or sadness, no=
 relief or sense of loss, you just aren't thinking any more so you don't=
 feel one way or the other.  and oddly, if you were to be reincarnated, then=
 you wouldn't really know it either, you would think that there would be=
 some sort of "interruption" that made it so that when you are reborn, your=
 new self is not conscious that there was anything before your new life, and=
 you don't regret anything that was left undone in the past life.
The second conclusion or answer is that religious poeple could be right, and=
 once you die, you may still have some sort of state of consciousness...call=
 it a dream, call it a new reality, whatever, and so at that point, if you=
 pissed of the right god(s) or whatever, you may really regret it, cuz you=
 may be just a brain in a bunch of blackness thinking to yourself, damn,=
 this is boring, and i miss my friends, and i wish i had told this person=
 this and done that thing before i died, or worse, you could be tortured for=
 the resxt of your life and then you'd really fuckin regret not being=
 religious.  of course you could be religious, in which case, you're going=
 to have a great time once your dead and have moved on to some "higher"=
 state of existence.  and maybe you'll miss the poeple you left behind and=
 wish you had done this or that, but still, there'll be so much more ahead=
 of you that those thoughts won't really weigh you down for long.

Subject:[B-R] Appeal for moral support

I'd like to send this letter to Boston-Raves mailing list and
to some friends of mine... I am not sure what effect it will have,
if any --- please do not flame :-)

I am writing this as an appeal for moral support and an appeal
to basic human decency in all of us...

To put it in very imperfect words... There is a miracle of rave
music and rave dance. There is a miracle of modern psychedelic
drugs. There is a miracle of the combination of raves and these drugs...

Many of us witnessed some parts of these miracles and understood
some of their great value. Perhaps, none of us understands this
completely and as a whole. Yet, many of us have a well grounded
feeling that these phenomena represent the cutting edge in the
artistic, philosophical, and spiritual quest of humankind...

Yet, raves and especially psychedelics undergo systematic oppression
and prosecution... Somehow, none of the measures, this society developed
specifically to protect basic human rights and spiritual quests of
its members, seem to work in this case... Well, it's not quite so,
of course, for if not for these measures, raves might not had existed at
all... Yet, the toll in human suffering, and specifically in suffering
of people, prosecuted for actions related to drugs, actions undertaken
with basically benign intentions, with no harm or serious danger of harm
to anybody, this toll is huge and unacceptable...

This is an appeal to the basic moral decency in all of you to support us
morally in our quest. There is a certain sense of urgency here. The
world development accelerates exponentially and nothing can be done
about this fact. There is a well grounded fear that "control" can be
easily lost. Just look at the following alarmingly growing list of
(interrelated, if you think about them deeply) negative phenomena.
Drug prohibition and prosecutions, high level of crime, high level of
poverty, wild speculations on financial markets, dirty fights on who
corners the market for their substandard products (especially,
software),
indecent circus around normal and basically harmless human weaknesses of
world leaders, lack of scrutiny of how these leaders use their enormous
fiscal and military powers, indecent greed of "reformers" and their
Western "helpers" in Russia, outrageous attempts of Russian "opposition"
to establish a bloody dictatorship in a country with 20+ thousands of 
nuclear warheads, widespread gross and dangerous abuse of drugs
instead of
benign and spiritual use of them, nasty things people do to each other
because of money, drugs, or other things, etc.

All these things have a very simple basic root --- human unhappiness and
aimless life. This leads to hostility, greed, false goals,
overconsumption, attempts to dictate others their behavior and beliefs,
etc. And to all these disasters on global scale. All this due to the
fact,
that traditional systems largely failed to make people happy and to
supply
a meaningful purpose to their lives...

I would like to testify here, that both raves, and psychedelic drugs,
and especially their combination have enormous potential to change all
that. When used properly, these things make people really and truly
happy,
supply them with immediate and first-hand bright spiritual experience,
so that they do not have to rely solely on books and words to obtain
their information about "non-material" issues, and help them to adopt
and stay on the path of fearless search for truth, and of helping others
as much as possible, and of love...

What happens, when raves or drugs are abused, like all good things are
unfortunately abused to some extent in this life, is besides the point.
They might be our only weak hope to make people happier and to change
their behavior to better patterns, before the combination of their
current
unhappiness together with exponential acceleration of progress
destroys us
all... 

So I'd like to appeal to all that is good inside each of you to support
this cause and to support shift to human happiness and decent
behavior, if
such shift is possible at all. It matters for us a lot, that you think
well about us, and that you do not think badly about us. If you have
a sincere internalized belief in God, please pray for us, because we
need
all such help pretty badly... If you do not believe in God, we need your
help too... Please talk to the people close to you, if you believe in
their basic human decency, about the need to shield our cultures, raves,
psychedelics, their combination, and all of us, from unjust and
unwarranted prosecution and about the need to make people happy and
purposeful, and the potential, which our cultures represent here...
Please appeal to the basic human decency of these people...
We need your help badly...

But, because of the climate of oppression, please do be careful whom you
are talking with about these issues, and how you are talking with them,
otherwise the effort might prove to be too dangerous for you...

This is not a chain letter, but everybody is free to distribute it
as s/he pleases :-) If you do distribute, please try to avoid
the effect of "multiple copies", when possible...

Peace, love, and gratitude to all of you...

Mishka

Anyone seen these? :

-Little Miss muffet sat on her tuffet (shows trippy girl trying to sit
down with all sorts of cactuses and stuff) . . . you would too if you
were that wasted.

-Little Jack Horner sat in the corner (shows some trippy guy crouching
down looking around) . . . you'd be paranoid too if you smoked that
much pot.

-Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep (shows trippy little bo peep in a
city street with cars zooming by) . . . you would to if you were that
stoned.

Those aren't the exact pharsings, but you get the idea.  I think the
whole thing is kinda stupid considering they are "de-moralizing"
little kids poems and nursery rhymes.

They are made to be really trippy using all sorts of crazy camera
angles and wierd costumes etc etc.  

They show one (which is like 15 seconds of something) then show a
quick, "don't do drugs call thsi number" and they do that two more
times for the other two.  It's bizarre.

aug is over 2 megs, so be warned.
sep is updated every time an email goes to the list.

these are the files the archives are created from and i have them up coz
alot of ppl read the list that way as i've found out over the last week or so.
this is an interim solution until the script is rewritten and not an ideal
way to read 'em.......

I havent seen any of the new ones that everyone is talking about.  The
only ones I ever see are like some guy/girl talkin about how the lost
all their friends and messed up their life cause they did drugs.  My
friends dad used to get all pissed off back in the day when those ones
that say "parents that do drugs have children that do drugs."  He
would shout "thats a lie!" Every time it came on.  It was super funny
later on when we found out he smoked madd buds...

My friend byron is having a Liquid After-Party at his house (right by
CWRU). If you want to go (and every pb-cle kid is invited) just get a
flyer from me at the net-meet or anytime during the night.

I'll have a pb-cle sign attached to my backpack....

"Life is anything that dies when you stomp on it" That's as simple as I 
want to keep it.

In reference to your discussion about life after death, I happen to know for a
fact that there is an existence after death.  I heard all the ghost stories,
and stories about angels and sighting of the virgin Mary, but I was 85%certain
that there is life after death.  The 15% uncertainty bothered me, until I went
on a tour of haunted houses on the north side of Pittsburgh, the people at the
house said that most of the "ghost" activity revolved around the main stair
well.  So while the rest of the people looked around the house and antiques I
focused on the stair well.  Before I knew it something humanoid in shape but
fuzzy gray in translucent color whisked by at the top of the steps about 15ft
in front of me.  I didn't say anything at first, but I told my girlfriend a
little later.  She told me she saw the same thing but she was a bit closer and
saw it from a different angle.  To her it looked like a little person or
child.  After the tour we went back and told the owner of the house what we
saw and where it was going.  He informed us that he has never seen that ghost,
but many guest to his house described the same sighting.  The only difference
was the other people saw it coming out of a door and going up stairs, we saw
it going down stair into the door.  Now I am 100% certain that their is
something after death.  Just because you can"t touch it or weigh it or put it
through scientific study doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Try to touch an ego,
or happiness, or sorrow, you can't prove they exist either. Any way I was
straight as a board when I saw this so was my girlfriend.  {:-o Mark

Hi. I'm new to Pittsburgh and this list so I thought I would introduce
myself.. I'm now a graduate student at CMU, in the Electrical and Comp.
Engineering Department..

Let's see, I'm 22, like building and designing analog synthesizers,
and spin ambient, trance, and jungle.. 

Before moving here, I went to the University of Missouri-Rolla, and
usually spend summers working in Berkeley, CA. 

Um, I'm into throwing house parties, graphic design, playing ultimate
frisbee and playstation, lying outside on warm summer days and taking long
naps on chilly winter afternoons..

...Right, so what's recommended for a newcommer to check out this weekend?
I'd love to check out a party or two and hopefully meet some people :)

Thanks,
raj

synthvortx@aol.com doesnt like the way i run the rom and says hyperreal is
a joke and is concerned about the state of the rom with the beastie boys
and front 242 listed on it.  comments to trout@hyperreal.org

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, as well as some somewhat related concert events, just testing
this out and we'll see what the reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

> > HEY! anyone else comin' to LOVE PARADE 2000 w/ da RSP?
> > ^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^ ^^ ^^^^

Awww yeah, baby!!!  Recently, a friend from Switzerland stayed with us for
a month.  All he talked about was LOVE PARADE LOVE PARADE LOVE PARADE!  He
even has a little pendant with the love parade symbol (a heart with little
circles beaming out).  He was sad because he missed this year in order to
come to the US.  He had a good time.  We made him work on our porch.
Anyway, our whole house wants to go (there are three of us, plus a
boyfriend).  He played this little video thing on our computer about the
parade and everything that surrounds it.  I found this book in a bookstore
in the Strip (between DeLuca's and the Mexican grocery).  A photographer
just picked people out of the crowd and took pictures of them in his make
shift studio.  It's written in German (duh), French, English, and Japanese
(I think).  It's pretty nifty.  I might send it to him and buy another if
he doesn't already have it.

Last evening, I went into what used to be Deep Records years ago, and I
was pleasantly surprised with what I heard.  It's now called Zero I.Q.
Records and is owned by Yacov (one of the Deep Records owners I think).

He carries mainly vinyl, but he had some cd's too.  There are plenty of
genres (unlike the other record stores in Cleveland which focus on just
one category).  Tik-Tak happened to be spinning when I walked in, and the
jungle he had was just what I like.  I guess he was making a mix-tape for
sale on Sunday.  It was some damned hard jump up with that rapidly moving
bass line and fast rhythm.  Yaaa!

So, check the place out.  The phone number is 216-297-1080.  It's on the
East Side just off of Mayfield and Noble/Warrensville Ct. Rd.

I guess that is why I responded personally!  Hee!
I'm single, I'm allowed, I'm waaay over 18, why not?  Besides he just 
might have info on a sequencer that may not be too crappy!  :)

Engineering types boring?  I don't think so!
>
I'm 35 like mixing tapes, recording music, use the computer for 
interesting things, made tons of contacts over the internet and had to 
make a box to keep the names and addresses straight and that no one gets 
duplicate tapes.  

Big admirer of Deadly Buda, been at Raves since 1992 (I was 29) haven't 
missed many.  

Went to Community College (Drive thru learning) Carlow, and Robert 
Morris Business School.  Put up with Yuppy shit for way too long, so 
went Ballistic and went to Radio Shack for Answers on how not to kill
these stupid people at the corporate mayhem I was working at.  They gave 
me a mixer and said they cover Gemsound turntables which I received from 
Tennessee.  They suggested I continue doing Hardcore for it is a great 
thing to do when you are in a bad mood.  I couldn't agree more.

Before raving I took Tae Kwon Do, and I was 25, but since they handed 
you a color belt for no good reason whether you knew how to fight or 
not, I discontinued but remembered on how to kill a person with your 
bare hands.  (Then they told you to disregard that because you could be 
tried for murder.)  I came close to killing everyone in corporate land 
but had to restrain myself, because severance pay would have been a lot 
more harder to get.  Note the had to get Combat Outfit for Rebelgade!

Enjoyed the more than 1 year vacation, and now since the money is gone, 
I want to do part time since I want to have a good look around before 
committing myself for anymore crap from power-hungry elitists.

I need a car and will get one once the stock market actually helps me 
out once in a while.  Well, not really, I mean, a little help I'll get 
from it, but I have been saving up the bonds for a good while. Ok, so 
that is pathetic too, but I am trying!  

R U Interested?  contact   djkali@hotmail.com

If you haven't yet been to hypervinyl today, go there,
because they got some really good stuff in!

Lots of jump up that's actually good!
They got a whole shipment of stuff from Nutty distro, including:
wardance + remix, first 4 bronx tunes, a shabba-ranks white-label thats
off the hook, hardstep #1 that's ballistic ragga (dj nut-nut), wicked new
2nd movement, hard hard new test #4 from dillinga, and at least one or two
other decent releases....heard the one copy of pandora's box they
had...damn! the lick!, but they're out for now ...get em' while they're
hot....

- cutup...finally getting the first 1200....

**WHooo-hOO!!* It's finaly here! Today this KiTteN has finally turned 21. :)
In case some of you have been feeling my absence it's because I have moved
back down to college, and my roommate has YET to bring the computer down
*scowl*. But, it should be back down there after this weekend, so I *ought* to
be back in full force. For the time being though, I hope to see as many of you
as possible tonight at Sensual. I'm gonna have to page through all this built-
up email to see if anything's going on there....we'll all celebrate my
birthday together :)

Okay, if there has been anything about any type of meet...I have missed it.
Anyone organizing a net-meet up for tonight at Sensual? I am hoping so, as I
have yet to make it to a meet, and this is a big night for me ;) Hope to see
some of you there :) Later on this afternoon I will be posting the 411 to find
me if I don't hear anything about a meet. Lata kidz :)

again...i'm coming from meadville, pa....just south of erie....if there is
anyone out there coming from this area or passing through this area, please
let me know....that is if you have room for 2...i'd love to see you all
again...but it looks like i might have to wait for magick.....you are all
going to that right???  i don't know if i'll be able to make anything before
that, but i'll be making an effort and a half...esp since i don't think i'm
gonna make liquid....if i don't see you all there....have a wonderful nite and
post some kick ass reviews so i can at least pretend i was there.

don't forget about SENSUAL tonight in cincy!  i'm surprised no one has
been talking about it.  jam master jay anyone?

i'll be in the "lunar lounge" ;)

directions i got off the line were a little hard to write down (rea talks
too fast!) but here's what i know: exit #9 off i-75, go R if coming from
N, L if from S, then one mile, pass a white castle, and at the 4th or 5th
light, pass a 2nd bridge (a railroad bridge) and look for caldwell drive. 
supposedly someone's going to be out there directing traffic. 

or just call CBS at 513.665.6572

WERD BOOTY!

Hi Geekboy!
       You and I were talking computer mubo-jumbo about 5 weeks ago down at
Metropol.  We chit chated for a bit about Unix.  If you don't mind....I'd like
to ask you some questions about Unix and a few other things!   If you could
email me privately I'd appreciate it!

<review>

SENSUAL, CBS' party in cincinnati last friday, began rather slowly, with
sound system problems and a pretty unenthusiastic crowd.  but by the end
of the evening, it turned into one of the best raves i've been to this
year. 

one obvious negative was the price, so let me deal with that first.  yes,
$30 was a bit, and even at $27 with a canned good donation, it was an
expensive event (luckily, i happen to fit into that small--but growing--
category of people who rarely end up paying for parties ;)  but i still
have to stand up for CBS on this one.  for the price, you got two
internationally-known artists: jam master jay and kenny ken, plus a lot
of other good names (well-known or unknown), and 4 rooms of sound, all in
a nice space. 

</review>

<promoter props>

i don't condone the rising price of parties, and obviously have fought
very hard to keep things cheaper and more accessible on MY end, but lets
face it, these budgets just keep getting higher.  while christian (main
manager of CBS) might seem greedy by charging such a high entry price (and
i would admit it should have been maybe $23-$27 at most), you just have to
remember how much it costs to hire high-profile performers like jam master
jay and kenny ken.  also, christian is looking at the bigger picture--he's
trying to do a certain kind of event; a different, higher class of rave
which necessarily requires a high budget.

so does this mean that CBS is in this for the money?  well, it's not my
place to say, but i would phrase it this way:  CBS is a professional
promotional entity.  unlike most of the ghetto-ass, newbie, drug-dealing,
or just plain inept promoters who are throwing parties these days, CBS is
a credit to the midwest rave scene.  if everyone threw their events as
professionally and respectfully as CBS does, i would be proud to call
myself a "raver" or "rave promoter." 

i don't mean to demean anyone's efforts to throw a party, but 80% of
today's promoters could learn a bit by examining just how christian
organizes and throws his events.  in my experience, christian is usually
respectful, conscientious, and straightforward in his business dealings. 
he knows how to organize things.  he keeps the lines of communication
strong.  his lineups are usually a well-balanced mix of big names you've
never gotten to hear, big names you want to hear again, and local DJs. 

in fact, it is the local aspect of his events which interests me the most. 
part of what christian is trying to do, it seems, is provide local talent
(admittedly his friends, mostly) with a chance to play on a higher level
than they usually can at other raves.  

for example, someone like myself can get a prime-time slot in a
decent-sized room, actually PLAY that timeslot and be heard, and even get
paid $100 bucks in the process.  $100 is a lot for me, as i usually get
nothing or maybe gas/expenses, so it is a pleasure to arrive at an event
and be treated respectfully.  i was immediately welcomed, given a
laminate, and told where to go.  as i was playing, christian paid me--i
have never had to "ask" him to be paid.  i was even offered a hotel room,
even tho i'm from columbus (1.5 hrs away!).  it's those little things that
make it a pleasure to play for him.  and honestly, christian could not do
those kinds of things if he did not charge a couple bucks more than
everyone else.

so look at it this way.  at most $20-$25 parties, you're paying for a few
big names, and a few medium-sized names, and a few locals.  at that kind
of party, which is usually terribly organized, someone like me would
probably have to fight for a laminate, fight for a time slot, and sleep on
a couch (or just drive home).  at a well-organized $25-$30 party, i get
taken care of.  is that too much to ask? 

</promoter props>

<review>

the party was held in a medium-sized, plantation-style clubhouse space
next to a golf course, under some intimidating electrical grids.  the
space was not huge, but just about perfect for this 1200-person event.  as
you entered one of the three front doors, there was a large central
rectangular area with marble floors, where people met and vendors created
their own little marketplace.  straight ahead was the main room, a
full-sized gymnasium, and a large platform area which doubled as a stage.
on either side of the marbled-floor area were two carpeted rooms which
served as the 2nd room and the jungle room.  below these and towards the
front, were two stairwells leading down to the another room and the
bathrooms on either side of the DJ.  this was the "lunar lounge" (which,
incidentally, i had nothing to do with except playing). 

and boy, it did get hot!  for a while, it must have gone up over 100
degrees inside, but was an immersive kind of heat that was somehow
appropriate and tolerable, especially if you were one of the many people
gettin' down to the music all night long.  made it kinda "sensual" (har
har).

musical highlights for me included joe blunt's sparse hard techno in the
2nd room, kimyon's deep track selection in the main room, troll and tre's
drastic drum'n'bass in the jungle room, and kenya dubois' deep, slow house
in the lunar lounge.  as for the headliners?  well, jam master jay did not
disappoint: his hip-hop antics and old-school MCing took me back to the
early '80s, and then some.  his style did eventually bore me, but that's
because i'm not a true hip-hop head (oh yeah, and i had to play, too).
kenny ken was also a strong performer, especially with MC fearless
bringin' us a taste of UK-style MCing.  not really my style of jungle tho,
kind of a cross between jump-up and two-step; not too innovative in my
book.  fun to dance to tho! 

the "vibe" was pretty thick.  usually, i go to parties and sense this
overall shadiness hovering over everything.  everyone seems fucked up but
me and a handful of other people; everything seems slimy and fakey
sugar-coated.  but not this time.  i don't know what it was, and it
probably had more to do with my recent coming to terms with my place in
the rave scene, but i felt like a welcome visitor at this event.  sure,
people were fucked up, but they were still walking around and interacting
with things in a reasonable way--not too many crackheads.  also, i didn't
get half as many fake raver hugs as i usually do...the hugs i got ths time
were from people i like, no rollers. 

the only disappointments were minor.  first of all, the lights never got
turned off in the lunar lounge.  that sort of killed the vibe in there
somewhat, tho surprisingly i heard no one bitch about it, and it ended up
being the room with the best vibe! (maybe because you could see everyone
clearly and hang out?).

second of all, there were two tweakers that had to be ejected from the
party.  some people just don't take their drugs responsibly, or their body
just cant handle them, so they freak.  i don't know what happened to
either one of those people (i never saw them--i only heard about them
later), but i guess there's always a few cases like that at such a decent
sized event--can't be helped.

third of all, the afterhours failed to materialize, despite great promise. 
about 100 yards over from the space were a few open-air shelterhouses,
with playground equipment and lots of shade, where it would have been
perfect to bring such a cool, clear morning in.  unfortunately,
complications with the space owners (who had booked another function at
the shelterhouses without notifying CBS) prevented that from getting off
the ground, even tho it was a great hangout area for about an hour. 
finally, after lots of confusion, the space owners agreed to pay CBS back,
but everyone had to leave.

the best moment for me was near the end of it all, as golfers began
arriving and looking at all the phat-panted people with very dumbfounded
looks.  

i was loading something to the car, when i overheard a raver grrl
talking with a VERY old golfer, probably in his '70s at least.  i heard
her trying to explain what we were all doing there, saying something about
DJs, records, dancing...then the old man said to her lovingly: "well,
whatever it is, it sure attracts a crowd!"  the girl then laughed and
wished him good luck in his game, to which the man replied: "thanks, i'll
need it!"

The person that I tried to meet @ LIQUID didn't make it or changed his mind.
I really need to find a way to DC.  I have a place for us to stay and
everything.  I'll be staying for a week.  You can stay however long  you want.
If anyone is going from the cleveland area and needs help driving down etc.  I
know the way and I'm willing to help.

If you think streaming audio kicks ass on a modem..... you really should 
try it on a fiber optic cable....i love T1 lines... anyways, once yinz 
all get that scheister installed, check out <www.tranzfusion.com> They 
have LOTS of streaming audio, and many linx to more. They also have linx 
to pages that do live broadcsts all the time. It's out of Melbourn 
australia, so it might be a little slow, but it's pretty cool anyways. 
LAtE! hope to see some of you at easy tonight!!!

Well, my birthday went over big :)I had a fabulous-o time at the party despite
the fact that the planned meet-up with the geekboy failed to materialize.
Sorry about that...I was there around 12, but 2 escaped me. I appologize.

Btw...it was great finally getting to meet you Jason, you're as sweet in
person as you are via electronic communication and your tape it great...I'll
get it to Bob asap.

Oh and also, if any of you made it down there...I was this girl that Ed saw:

<<  i heard
 her trying to explain what we were all doing there, saying something about
 DJs, records, dancing...then the old man said to her lovingly: "well,
 whatever it is, it sure attracts a crowd!"  the girl then laughed and
 wished him good luck in his game, to which the man replied: "thanks, i'll
 need it!"  >>

:) what a sweetie that old man was :) I wonder how his golf game went.... ;)
how ironic that someone would happen to overhear that and happen to post it
here :)

later kidz...my computer should be down at school this coming weekend, so I'll
be checking mail more regularly and responding more often.

If folks really want pb-cle t's, here's my suggestion:
All artistically inclined folks come up with some designs.  
Make as many as you have idears for.
If you can scan the things, do it.
Otherwise mail them to me, and I can scan them for you.
We can put em' up on the pb-cle website.
Then everybody can vote on a design or just pick the one they like.

Possibility:  I just got a fairly decent color printer and I'm buying
t-shirt transfer paper.  I could just print out designs and people could
transfer them onto any shirt they want.  Cover up that ugly JNKO/Tommy 
logo. 

Or we could just have patches, so you could put them on your jacket, bag
whatever.  Or theres also the scheme of getting some real cheezy mesh
pee-wee football jerseys made with plastic lettering and all.  Pretty
cheap if you buy for the whole team, or list as it may be.

Of course, this may be overestimating the overall geekpride [tm] of the
list. ;)

l8s,
 cutup

ad far as shirts go, I have one major thing to say: KEEP IT SIMPLE!
the best designs are the simple ones, they stick out and are easier to
see at parties.  
i say definitely go for flourescent inks when printing the shirts.  i
love plain t shirts with floro ink.  
and, as far as the patches that geoff suggested go, I say thats a nifty
idea!

I'd definitely buy a shirt, AND a patch, and I don't even live anywhere
near pb-cle zone anymore.  (But I'll always be a pittsburgher at heart)

toodles,
Count Zer0

Hey did anyone go to Easy in DC?

I was going to go and was even in the area but the flyer  made me kinda 
depressed...

Although the line-up was all that - the whole thing just seemed so _BIG 
BUSINESS_ right down the giving the phone number for the Marriott for 
people looking for a place to stay...

I don't know. Perhaps I'm an idealist but I just hate to see the scene 
_sell out_ to that extent and don't want to contribute $$$ to its 
demise. Rave kids checking in at the Marriott? Doesn't seem right...not 
very _undergroung_ either.

Anyway, keen to hear some reviews in any case


'later

Liquid was a blast.  I'll post later--I haven't been on a computer for 
1.5 weeks.  This is so unlike me.  And this is not my computer I am 
writing from so I should go.

first i must say that i'm suprised that i'm the first review of liquid...esp
considering that there were supposed to be 45 people or so from the list
there!! speaking of which...i'm gonna make a go of remembering everyone i
met...please don't feel hurt if i don't get everyone....i will find you at the
next party and still say hi....trust me.

nice to see you again:  trout, spike, geekboy, jade (my little pink elephant
and her sidekick piglet the fourth...or is it fifth)

nice to meet you: lorianne, ratfink (sorry i didn't make afterhours), lil
sarah, braden (damn...i know i'm missing ppl and i feel like shit about it)

anyway...on the the review.

when we got there (around 1:30am) i was not in the best of moods...we had some
serious trouble before we got there....total side story so i won't go into
it....we made it...that's what counts.  as i was saying...my mood wasn't
totally positive so the music and the venue were a little too dark for
me....they just kinda kept me in a funk....i went to the net meet and things
got better....it's always good to see familiar faces and find some new ones to
look for....hugs are always great too....thanx to those who gave one up for
me.  i spent much of the nite chilling w/ ppl and watching the awesome
lights....props to electrolyte fx for that one!!!  they were fascinating to
say the very least....i danced a little, but couldn't get into
it....then....all of a sudden it hit me....i heard this sound....it was
like....i dunno what...but it got me off my feet....but instead of dancing i
went up to the booth to see who it was that had motivated my tired, pathetic
ass to get up and move....it was misjah...that set was.....wow...that's all i
can say....i don't know what it was about it, but it just hit me like a train
and just flowed through me for the full 2 hours of his set....when i was
dancing i was floating...when i was watching him...i was in awe....his set
showed off the sound system to it's fullest (here's where i give love to
wizard workshop).....the venue wasn't bad....i just prefer multi room
events....and a chill out space that's less hectic....but the muchies are
always appreciated and the seats were kinda nice too....i am sad that i missed
product 19...and my friend was so hoping to hear commander tom, but i think we
missed him too...or we just weren't paying attention...

overall rating of the party (5-* system)
****
had to drop one for the single room and chill space...but all in all....gotta
say house of styles and shortarm know how to throw a party.

for my experience
*** (due to my mood and some other random stuff)

i can't wait to hear what everyone else has to say....we all know that this is
all MHO...and what do i know??

PLUR
Hey_You

welp, liquid was better than i expected honestly...i was sorta wondering how
it would be venue wise, considering i'd been there ample times before... it
was dark, but i liked the lighting near the stage and the sound was good
...over all i liked most the dj's ..
no major disappointments
alot of pluses...

and as for the net meet, i guess i missed most of it, ...cuaght the end of the
meet and gotta say hi to EVERYONE i saw.... hmmm... i wont list cuase i'd
leave people out and feel bad :)

piglet had fun to... and what do ya know....i ran into the kid who found my
original piglet (that i happened to of lost at that very venue)  imagine
that!!!!   i was very happily surprised :) :) :) :)

as for the after hours... me and the kiddies i drove up with we helped with
some clean up then headed out to the after hours...we got there walked inside
only to be shortly kicked out by the piggies, they had 3 cop cars there, and
the music was NOT loud and everyone was behaving themselves,..i heard a cop on
his radio saying they were breaking it up becuase there were to many
people...he told us there were to many complaints from the neighbors..oh well
    ...so we headed home

i was going to head to DC for EASY but my work screwed me over on hours that i
was supposed to have off  so i couldn't  :(    

welp
thats all from 
the little pink elephant
and her trusty sidekick, piglet

Can someone please give God a handclap and shake hands
w/ the Shortarm & H.O.S. crews for the slammin' party!!
=^)
A BIG shout out to all the pb-cle list ravaz that I got to
kick it w/ that evening. The vibe was definitely alive.
Somehow I didn't see ya there Casey. Wazzup w/ that?
hehehe....And somehow lost track of Spike. Thought that
you and the rest of the Pitts. crew might show up on Sun.
afternoon in Crakron. hope to see ya soon.

Favorite events of the evening : Watching Misjah throw down
on three tables and having the a record hanging precariously
on the table on his right lookin about to go flyin off while
findin that beat on the next two.
Mad props to Kevin Cunningham for his phat set as well.

What did worry me that night was all the "gangsta's" that
showed face and caused havoc. Also hearing _way_ too
many stories 'bout herion use and  K too.
Talk about shit that will ruin this scene.
Being catatonic has never improved a damn thing.
Do us all a favor and keep that f*~kin' shit outta parties.

Well, back to the kewl side of things.....
How many of yaz watched Osheen? Was that not just
the most motivating insurgence of live work we have
had the pleasure of experiencing lately? (I'm moved)

Somebody said this already, however I just want to reaffirm
the statement that "with this many ppl. we should pick our
own DJ's and event location" hhhrrmmm..... food for thought.
NEwayz ....   check yaz all L8a.... prolly in Buffalo next, eh?
*grins*

So whatever happened to people protesting, standing up for what they
believe in, making a difference?  They died, that's what happened.  I feel
so lily-livered as I file quietly out of a venue that is busted by the
5-0, not actually looking anyone in the eye (not because of drugs).  It's
not fair that they're shutting us down.  It's not fair that they're
kicking us off of public property.  It's not fair that we're too chicken
to stick up for ourselves!

I wish we could protest.  I wish we could change the world.  It all seems
so hopeless as our scene becomes mainstream and we stay underground, prone
to harassment while the people who didn't like techno yesterday hear it in
their Kleenex commercials and feel happy.  

I'm sorry I'm ranting.  It was something Jade said about the cops showing
up just to move people on because of our numbers.  Are they afraid of us
in our numbers?  Do they know we're coming?  Meet y'all at city hall.

Ok, here goes

    When I finally got in around 1:30 Dj Smalls(major congrats) was in the
middle of a grooving techno set that included the React Records song
Elevator, haven't heard that in a long time, but I am die hard fan of most
of the React brand of trancy snap crackle pop techno and was quite pleased.
The main room was quite small (eheh) and didn't even notice the dj balcony
booth until later in the night.  This main dance floor was packed  all
night.
     Finally around 2:30 or so Electric Skychurch came on in the main room,
and did about a one and a half hour set (not the 2.5 hour one that was
promised :( )  Since I am a huge admirer of the Skychurch I was more than
happy and the visuals were just amazing.
     The dance floor got less crowded eventually for Omar Santana's set
which I really got into, never hearing him before.  It all ended with Scott
Henry who again brought a great big smile to my face and life in my feet!

On a downote we had to wait about 1.5 hours in line even though we already
had tickets.  No backpacks or purses were allowed and a lot of people were
notably frustrated.  I thought the easy crew still did a good job of
handling things, but perhaps it would be better to think twice about using
a venue such as a hotel club in a  major metropolitan area.  These problems
are more to do with the DC area than the promoters, but I think just going
for a more secure , friendly and bigger space would have made the vibe much
greater at this party with so much talent.
     I really enjoyed myself as did my beautiful companion who dragged me
to a DC bauhaus concert before hand. ;)

Gotta love dat skychurch!
Missed Diselboy and the other junglists. Perhaps I woulda had more of a
chance if it was not for the long wait on the DC streets outside!

plur :-)

Thanks for the review...

I spoke to a friend this morning who went.

He said he'd had tons of fun but that the bouncers had been hard-core 
and had pulled kids aside the whole night to be searched. He told me 
that some guy had been searched and although they found no pills they 
found $400 on him which they confiscated and ejected him from the party 
on suspicion of dealing. This may be a wild rumor but a hairy story 
none-the-less.

He also compalined that it had been crammed (no room for expression)
and agreed with your sentiment that such a star-studded party would have 
been better outside the DC metropolitan area in a venue with bigger 
rooms.

Still, I'm sorry I missed that line-up. Next time... ;)


Brad

schedule."bleah bleah misjah at 3:30, and commander tom is a bitch. talk

<stream of consciousness--sorry>
overlooking the traffic in columbus and the accident on 71, the drive 
was about average.  this was probly one of the best venue's i've ever 
been to.  super clean/good lighting (the lunar lounge was lit up a bit 
much though).  it was such a blast to see sooo many smiles there.  i 
spent most of the night meeting up with ppl i never get to see and a 
little less time dancing than i would've liked but the whole ordeal was 
crescent fresh!  i missed the 12:am meet though cuz of helpin out one of 
my boyz on a bad roll :^(   but he was up an runnin for JamMasterJay( 
i'm not much into the hips&hops, but the shit sounded smooth as hell to 
me and he brought out some of the old stuff).  cops were walkin around 
the parking lot keepin an eye on everyone's rides (to make sure they 
didn't get away?)  and the staff inside kept everything together as far 
as i saw.  who was blowin the glass pipes?  that was pretty tuff to 
watch walkin by.  the jungle/d&b room was pretty tight, but they 
couldn't get the back lights up.  i wandered between rooms a lot, findin 
my !Michigan kids!.  unfortunately, i didn't catch too many full sets, 
but from JamasterJ on, i was at the main stage.  the lights came on full 
blast at ?6:00? (no watch) which was kinda scary. everyone i went with 
and ran into said they had a good time which definitely brought me up 
even more.  

thanks to anyone and everyone who helped out/put this together/made the 
drive/smiled back when i smiled at ya.  i had to miss liquid to go, but 
i was there in spirit (really).

rambling endlessly,

-MikeD

hi kiddies
well liquid was fun i guess...the whole night went really fast and is 
kind of blurry to me...i met a ton of kids..i won't even try to name all 
of you but...hugs and smooches to spike, steve, hey you, benny, ratfink, 
geekboy, brian, kevin, spyboy, byron..(sorry but we were too cracked out 
and couldn't find your house) and everyone else..
i did experience some major shadiness...my roommate got beat up...13 
guys...not ravers..punched him and kicked him for one pill...he hung in 
there though and we stayed all night but it was the first shady 
experience i've had in cleveland and i'm very disappointed 
i had trouble dancing for some reason so i just sort of ran around and 
talked to kids...all things considered still an ok night..until later
smooches
little sarah

 I went to Easy. You are so, so sadly correct about the big money thing. 
RANT #1: TOO MANY PEOPLE!!!
 It was in a club, which isn't always that bad, but this space was VERY
POORLY set up for a party of that size. The dance floors were all way too
small, and they were connected by a series of tiny hallways and small rooms
which greatly added to the congestion. It was incredibly overcrowded. No
room to dance anywhere. It was so crowded in the main room when Electric
Skychurch played that people only had room to wave their arms above their
heads. It looked like a rock show. I managed to find a spot far to the left
of the stage, behind the sound guy.  I was able to dance a little, but
people kept walking by (I was right in front of one of those tiny
hallways). The crowd thinned out quite a bit after Skychurch, but dancing
space was still at a premium for the rest of the night.

RANT #2: $3 WATER!!!!
Yes, that's right. $3 for an 8 oz. glass bottle of water. What was worse
was that the tap water tasted like it had been recycled from the toilets. I
can put up with bad tasting city water, but this stuff was DISGUSTING! So
much for refilling my water bottle...

RANT #3: ASSHOLE SECURITY!!!!
I'm usually pretty laid back about security at parties. I completely
understand that promoters as well as venue owners have to cover their
asses. But security was absolutely ridiculous on Sunday night. They would
not let people sit down on the floor; don't ask me why, I haven't the
faintest idea. But every time someone would sit down on the floor to rest,
a security guard would come by, shine a flashlight in their face, and tell
them to get up. I couldn't figure it out. They weren't breaking up big E-
pits or anything, either. I could maybe see the reasoning behind THAT, but
this was ridiculous. What problem could possibly be caused by one lone
person sitting down with their back against the wall? 
    But that's not all. An acquaintance of mine was kicked out for filling
up her water bottle in the men's bathroom. 
    And it gets better yet.  A boy I know  told me that security had taken
him into a back room and STRIPSEARCHED him. They found no contraband items
on him whatsoever, but they still proceeded to take the $400 dollars he had
and refused to give it back. When he asked them for it, they said "what
money? I don't know what you're talking about." He said he was just
standing there, and  they walked up and said, "come with us. We're going to
search you." They had apparantly been watching him all night and thought he
was selling drugs. I honestly don't know if he was selling drugs or not,
but he didn't have any drugs when they searched him, but they took the
money anyway.  

All that aside, the music was excellent all night. That's about the only
good thing I have to say. What good is music when you can't dance to it? 
Oh yeah, the lights were pretty good, too.

I wish I had something more positive to say about this party but I really
can't think of anything else. I knew before I went that this party was
going to be all about money, but  I thought that the music would make up
for that. They had a bomb lineup, and I had only seen Skychurch once
before, so I really wanted to go. Seeing them was almost worth my $25
admission, but it wasn't worth being pushed around and stared down by
security all night. It isn't very often that  I leave a party feeling
totally pissed off. No matter how bad the party sucks I try to have a good
time anyway. At Easy, it was nearly impossible to have a good time.  So
there's your review. All your expectations were fulfilled.

Love,
Amber

     ok, i finally woke up from a weekend of raving,
     with flaming red hair, blistered feet and 
     acid burn on my tongue. there's a shitty feeling
     in the back of my throat and an ache in my skull
     that won't go away, and i have a lot to think 
     about.

     atomic: nice. i was looking forward to my weekend,
     so i felt gooood, and loved tr-generation's bomb
     little set - didn't expect it to be so nice.

     sensual: nobody seemed able to go with me on such
     short notice, so i walked by the computer lab, and
     asked a co-worker if she wanted to go to a rave.
     she'd always wanted to go to a rave, so she went...
     took a little longer getting there than i expected,
     got in around 1:30. mad crowding and heat first off,
     couldn't find the restrooms until 2:15, so no net-
     meet (sorry housekitten, next time?). since the
     person i went with was being adamantly straight
     edge, i raved clean, which in retrospect was a very
     good idea. the vibe at first was very weak, nobody
     dancing, few people messed up. but when jam master
     jay came on (at about 2:45am) it became obvious 
     what everyone was there for. i have never seen such
     a mad response to anyone, the whole main room had
     their hands in the air, dancing. phat. i really
     enjoyed that part, and from then on a lot more 
     ppl danced, until the end of the party at 6:00am.
     complaints: the space was overcrowded and hot, and
     the a/c wasn't bringing new air in, and the oxygen
     got really limited. i ended up getting oxygen 
     deprivation and was really sick, numb fingers, 
     tingling, because i danced really hard. so i couldn't
     stick around for the afterparty which ended up falling
     through anyway. complaints: way overpriced by any
     justification. there's no way such a short party with
     such short main sets and no afterparty should have
     cost so much. the promoters should have ventilated
     the space more. the sound was weak, cranked treble
     but wimpy bass - i've seen better systems at 250 
     person parties. for thirty bucks i think you can do
     better than 25 kilowatts and 5 intelligent fixtures.
     the setup at liquid was much, much better. ok, so
     there were four rooms, but nobody was dancing in 
     the little secondary rooms anyway. but anyway, we
     had a good time altho i'm not driving 4 hours to 
     another cbs party, i think. <cough>

     liquid: i actually wanted to run up to toronto for
     hyped, but i was tired and sick from sensual and
     had to sleep. so i went up to liquid with 5 friends.
     it was at the familiar skatin' place, so we didn't
     get lost. but my transmission ran low on fluid and
     threatened to eat itself. we pulled into a BP that
     was closed, but the attendants were still there, and
     one of them drove home, got some ramps and trans 
     fluid, and i crawled under my car and filled up the
     trans, at least a bit. it helped but in the process
     i lost synchro on third gear which makes me very
     sad. i'm having bad luck, it seems. anyway, we got
     to liquid around 1:30am, paid our $15 and had a lot
     of phun until our impetuous friends left at 6:00am.
     nice net-meet. not many ppl danced until about 4am,
     and then it got better. too much shady sh*t going 
     down for my liking, not enough of the good chemicals
     and too much of the bad. greetings to all the netkids:
     matt, benny, sford, trouty, liquid, lilsarah, jade, 
     don [send me pics?], lorianne, jeffchung, spike [rollll],
     braden, casey, hey_you, schwanke, amanda [hug], erik,
     and i'm sure some others i forgot. the only problems
     i had was that i spent all the party looking for certain
     chemicals and only found them at the end. plus the stuff
     i did only kicked in after we left the party, so we had
     a mini-rave in my car all the way down to new york :]
     but i had fun anyway, nice party, cool kids. 

     fantasia IV (or, the NYC rave from hell):
     i was really tired so i was nibbling on some paper all
     the way down to NY and by the time we got there i was
     rather hit. NY traffic is pretty intense on 1/16oz + 1hit.
     anyway, so we got to the venue for fantasia around 8pm
     having driven 15 hours (route planning? not my fault) to
     get there. there was mad shady sh*t going down all around
     which increased as the opening time approached. the kids
     seemed scared. i saw probly $10k worth of e being passed,
     ppl doing bumps like it was cool, guys wandering around
     shouting their wares, networking. my friends started to
     get frightened, even the ones that had been to lots of 
     parties. one or two were first-timers, and i dunno what
     _they_ thought. i was on acid, and i was shivering. there
     was mad security, with dogs, and they were letting 10 ppl
     in at a time to walk down an open stretch to a searching
     setup. males and females were separated and subjected to
     a massive search, personal objects (pens, manic panic, 
     pocket knives) were confiscated. full underwear/shoe 
     search, etc. i had some psychedelics in my boots, and
     the acid plus the atmosphere wasn't making me too happy.
     even the NY kidz were scared. every now and then a few
     mafioso in their vintage cars would drive in. they started
     to search me, and they said they'd confiscate my key-ring
     knife, and i wouldn't get it back. i asked if i could put
     it in my car, and they said if i did they'd never let me
     back in. i just wanted to get the hell out of there. so
     i walked out ('we got one walking out') and sat in my
     car wondering what the hell any of this had to do with
     raving. i heard a scuffle behind my car, and a little 
     raver kid was getting beat up by a bunch of dealers 
     because he had a few pills. he ran into the crowd at the
     gate but they wouldn't let him in, so he just sat there,
     jumping around like a scared rabbit. the dealers just 
     sat around the outside of the crowd, waiting. then my
     friends came out, scared shitless because they thought
     i was going to get killed or thrown into jail. as far
     as that goes, i think the mafia has better things to do.
     but anyway, my friends were either mad as hell or crying.
     it turned out the water was shut off inside and they
     were selling 20oz bottles for $5. there were more dealers
     than kids inside. the whole party was ruthlessly rigged.
     we just wanted to get away from the evil so we drove off.
     my friends refused to stay in NY so we drove to NJ to
     find a hotel. we rented a room and crashed. anyway the
     verdict on NYC scene is that the parties are put on by
     satan and his cronies and they eat plurry little ravers
     for lunch, at least that's what my friends think. i got
     my brain rewired. i just got an insight into human nature
     that was just way too damn deep for my liking. the entire
     object of fantasia IV was to get the maximum amount of
     money from the maximum amount of ravers in the fastest
     possible amount of time. whatever.

     anyway, i did have fun this weekend, but NYC wasn't a
     picnic. all i got out of that was a mad appreciation for
     the pgh scene, and i guess that's not a bad thing.

     that's it i guess.

     hugs

you asked about commander tom =)  so here is the story.

i (lou from shortarm) sent commander tom his signed contract, deposit, and
plane ticket all in JUNE.  everything was completely taken care of from our
end.  on tuesday, i got a fax from his agent asking for his hotel information
and venue information, as well as who would be picking him up.  this is a
usual thing.  i faxed it back early the next day, because i was taking care of
paying off the venue and other last minute details.  


well, thursday evening, i get a call from the agent (jennifer williams from
oncet in brooklyn) saying that tom is VERY VERY pissed, and he won't even
consider getting on his plane to america (he was supposed to play in chicago
on friday night).  she said that she tried to fax his hotel/venue info to him
all day on wednesday, and that she repeatedly left voice messages saying that
she was trying to do so, but the fax wasn't picking up.  apparently, she had
no contact with him at all that day.  thursday afternoon, she receives a fax
from tom saying that she was very unprofessional, and that he wasn't coming,
no matter what she said or did at this point.  apparently, she had been trying
to fax him on his normal phone line.  from this point, at about 7 pm on
thursday, the agent in nyc, me, and the promoter in chicago tried calling tom
every 15 or so minutes at home, and faxing him until about 6 am in the
morning.  he had turned off his cell phone, and took both of his lines off of
the hook.  

this is the first time that a dj hasn't showed up for me ever, so i was quite
determined to do anything in my power to get him here.  i called misjah in
amsterdam at around  in the morning (his time) and had him even try to get
ahold of tom (they know each other).  i also called commander tom's other
agent in nyc, pam film, to see if she could help.  we even went to the airport
to see if he had decided to come without us knowing.

however, as you all know, my efforts failed because tom was a no show.  this
is why the price was only 15 dollars all night.  sorry if i seemed a bit edgy
when you asked me about commander tom, but i was pretty much very mad until
early in the morning

Lou

it was actually in the mariott complex.   the part it was in was kinda a

well its not about being "underground"....  i thought it was about having
fun?  i had a blast.   do you recommend motel 6?  there are still plenty of
smaller "underground" events being thrown.  support those if thats how you
feel.  oh from a financial standpoint it was 25$ for dc with a huge lineup
and i can bet that fury was that also with a mostly lackluster lineup.

>Anyway, keen to hear some reviews in any case
the music was good for the most part.  i really have to say electric
skychurch is VASTLY overrated and there was a dj there that was pretty
bad...  i dont know who he was but oh well not that its a big concern.  the
jungle room was awesome,  the bass was overpowering at points, you had to
breath just right or the bass would knock the air out of your throat !!!
wowie!  thats the way i like it!   dieselboys set was rilly good and i
think doc scott was after him???  he was good too.  i still dont get into
the MC thing, they kinda take away from it ...   now i see the hype over
scott henry,  that man was good.
all in all except for the drive it was a great party.
an excellent weekend of parties i must say!!   i'll leave the liquid
reviews to everyone else, since EVERYONE was there!!!!

Hi Everyone, I went to liquid on Sat. had a great time.  We got to Cleveland
at about 3:00 PM and had to wait for all the birthday partes at the skating
rink to end.  Along with the help of everyone Don from wizard workshop had the
sound installed in about an hour the same with the lights.  Everyone at the
party seemed to be having a good time, but I have to apologize to Moze, I
looked for him around 2:00 AM and could not find him in the crowd. (Moze if
you would have stuck around until the morning I was still there packing up the
speakers).  After that we drove to D.C. for Easy.  It was very hectic to set
up in time for the party by 9:00.  And the security was less than helpful by
blocking doors and explaining to them we were trying to set up a party.  My
buddy Don worked security at the door, checking wallets, purses, and
cigarettes, but if you were cool with him he had a problem seeing little
objects when searching.  If you had an attitude his vision got much better and
he would find anything that you might smuggle in.  The security inside all
seemed to have attitudes.  I saw one guy pop a tic-tack in his mouth and they
went over and interrogated him over it.  My friend Teresa had a headache and
went to take an aspirin.  The security grabbed the aspirin and wanted to know
what she was up to.  After explaining she had a headache, they told her she
didn't belong there if she had a migraine.  As for myself I left the party at
2:30am after my wallet was grabbed out of my pocket,  I got it back
fortunately.  Due to the lack of dance space, and the natzy like security, I
didn't care for the party, but the music was pretty good.  The other thing
what was with them serving alcohol to a bunch of people that were getting
dehydrated.  I think that Easy is one "trip" I could have without.  Catch all
you crazy partiers at the next big one.  Peace {;-) Mark

Three friends and I are pleased with this past weekend. Hyped was almost 
worth the $35 (canaidan)...seeing as we got great deals on Jelly 
Beans!!!!!!WOW...anyway...we left Cleveland via I-90 around 2pm with 
only a very general USA+Canada road map and that nervous feeling you get 
when you leave your hotel addresses and phone#'s on your 
printer............but 5.5 hours and $10 (american) in tolls later...we 
were exiting the QEW into downtown Toronto. (did I mention we heard the 
ph-fattest ferrari roar past us!!!) I had no clue where we were, where 
we were staying, if we would even get in the venue....in other words, I 
was starting to have a massive panic attack. I found some public parking 
underground Nathan Phillips Square (the meeting place) reclined in my 
seat and just breathed --for like a minute until my friends got on me to 
get up and get walking. Being turned down at one hotel for "no vacancy" 
and almost hopeless at finding a decent room in any other, we trotted 
over to the Square and introduced ourselves to the kids. Their 
exasperation over us being from Ohio did not help my mood....I figured 
if they were that surprised to see out-of-towners at one of their 
parties, it probably wasn't going to be that good. All that changed when 
we got a room at the Sheraton and -- get this -- 20 minutes later I 
started to get the good dizzy feeling. Back over to the Square we loaded 
the buses (yeah they provided transportation to the party). Ten minutes 
later it hit me.....the music! I swear the bus windows were shaking! 
This club was huge!!!...and so was the line!!! Everyone was rolling and 
dancing...what a great start. Went through security ('bout average fuzz) 
and into the main room. Oh yeah this is what I call a club. Great lights 
and effects, loud-ass drum&bass, lots of vendors...candy, gum, mixed 
adrenaline drinks, merchandise--the works. We girls left our dates and 
went exploring. Four rooms...and running water in the bathrooms. We 
found our spot in the House room and danced and danced and danced. Then 
another thing happened....people. Lots of 'em. Everywhere. Soon there 
was no room to dance or chill....it was at least 200 degrees and the 
ceiling was dripping. Oh god. My first peak was long gone and I could 
barely keep my head up. It was only 2:30....I'd been therre 4.5 hours 
and was already partied out. I think you know what happened next...I 
needed to get energy. I was only aloud to take .25 of a pill (3rd time 
rolling-not a pro yet), but I began felt better. 2nd peak hit and I 
couldn't stop dancing. wow. That's all I have to say. Night ended at 
5:30...would have stayed if there was room to move in that place.


5 - * rating system



venue = *****
I liked that big club. Incredible sound .

atmosphere = ***
some bad attitudes....not a lot of "excuse me"'s.

overall party = ****

geekboy I feel bad for your weekend...should've driven to Toronto.

words of advice....always buy a map, always reserve your room (we were 
raped...$500 (canaidan) for two nights -- ouch) and always get a good 
night's sleep BEFORE you leave.

Why not declare the Rave your religion.  Then anyone who tried to shut you
down would be violating your constitutional rights, plus you can get the help
of the A.C.L.U.  Any how this is just at suggestion.  Good luck and keep on
raving.

I have this great PLUR for all of y'all.  I cannot describe how great it 
feels to feel you know kids from the list from only meeting them once.  
It all started at Phorm where I met lots and lots.  I can remember but 
there was too many names.  I was straight that night and I would 
classify that rave as one of thee best raves I have ever went to just 
because of the vibe.  It is all about the vibe to me.  I need and yearn 
to be and feel free when I dance.  I trully felt that.  I met aspecial 
person too--you know who.
LAST WEEK  We went to Detroit for Freaks believe in Beats.  Yet another 
excellent time.  There were shady promoters but everything worked out 
great.  Detroit has an awesome scene.  The music was really kickin it.  
I still can't believe I didn't see the third room until the end of the 
night, CRAZY. Wish I wrote a review last week.

And now this week, Liquid was cool.  I met more kids can you believe it 
I don't know who remembers me but as always the kids are cool.  I have 
to admit though in the middle of the night the vibe was scary on the 
right side of the roller rink but that was probably the crack 
talkin'(just kidding).  And It was crazy to see Cleveland kids who 
remember me from Phorm(my first cleveland rave).  Few notes:

Geekboy had his shirt off.  Crazy kid--hope i didn't scare you

Lil' Sarah-- believe me you were having a fun night when I was talking 
to you

Matt--you're awesome-you know that already

Carousel--Thanks for the neck massage thingie--blew me away.  your 
awesome

Trout--nice to finally meet you


etc.............

I am too tired to write personally to anyone  else but I love you all

Wish I stayed at byron's partee longer.  The cops scare me though. :( 
With all my situations you know

WEll PLUR

bEnny

>     fantasia IV (or, the NYC rave from hell):
<snip bad stuff about ny rave>

I read alt.rave sometimes, and there is a thread currently running
there about how shady the scene is in NYC. Apparently there is a
gang called BTS(I think that's the name of it) who deal at all of
the parties, and if they suspect that someone else is dealing, they
surround the person, beat the shit out of them, and take all their
money and pills. I hope that isn't a preview of what is to come 
here...

i think this definitely bears a little repeating...  it has been some 
time that something like this brought me down so much.  it makes my

here.  i'm proud to say that i've never had a BAD experience around 
pb-cle and i hope i can always say that.

Now that's an idea..... we can say that doing drugz is part of our 
religeous practice and then we couldn't be prosecuted for that either. 
hmm.....it worked for the indians...i think we could make this work.

Okie, i'll just comment on this now to avoid further confusion. The $3 
water and the asshole security were because of the venue, not the 
promoter. Lulu's cafe' got all beverage procedes, and the majority of 
the security personel were employees of Lulu's.  I give mad props to 
Ldopah for putting this party together and having everything come off so 
smoothly considering the crap they had to deal with from the owner of 
the venue. I'll post more later...

Isn't there another party in Pittsburgh on the 25th?  That's not canceled,
is it?  I hope there is.  I was planning on coming back for it.
Confirmations, anyone?

I don't think they just deal at the parties, i'm pretty sure that they 
work in conjunction with a bunch of the promoters out there. They'll set 
up this party with a phatty line-up to draw all kinds of peeps from out 
of town and shit, and then find the ones that have money or drugs, or 
whatever. At April foolz, there were BTS acting like security guards and 
confronting people about drugs or whatever. Then they'd take them off to 
the side and make them empty their pockets and give them everything of 
value. This is the very reason that i won't go to any parties in Philly, 
NYC or anywhere upstate or in Jersey. The scene is corrupted out there 
and holds nothing but bad vibes.  Fuck all that big city, huge party, 
gang-affiliated bullshit.  I'm happy with my pb-cle and midwest kidzz.

i've been in a major need of a boost lately.
so i drank that milk for old people. <rimshot>

anyway, i was feeling all down on the universe (mostly bored at work),
but then i checked out some links that i'd forgotten about for a while and
it really got me grinnin like some sort of horney bear in a honeypatch.

check out:
http://www.in2nett.com/mroth/tentacles.htm

Its just a link page, but go there and start following the links, straight
down from the words section on....you'll be sucked into a vortex of
inspiration and psychedelicious graphics that would put all but the best
(and even they'd be shakin') rave graphics to shame.

That's all.

Sorry for the gratuitious posts....

To the guy who sent me some pb-cle-shirt ideas...sorry i deleted your
email, but i saved the graphics.  ;P 
Pretty nice. I like the first one the best - what font is that? 

I did a few random designs fiddling around @ work...
http://www.pitt.edu/~gmmst22/pics/pb1.jpg

there's also pb2,3,4, and 5.
i think i like pb1 and pb5 the best myself...but none really floors me.
Lemme know what you think.

the good news is:
exposure is still on (with doran chambers, tommie sunshine, dj^2,
tr-gen, ryan matthews, b.dee)

the bad news is:
circuit 6 has been demoted to "maybe" status... so we might not play
(due to complications w/ the space)

but it'll be bomb-az-fuk either way!

     i wuz sleeping the sleep of the wicked. i'm sorry,
     but i think i need more than two days a week that i 
     don't rave. plus i had to work at midnite so i would
     have missed sine's set ANYWAY <stick out tongue>.

     so there are excuses.

     i wish i could have made it tho. if i didn't have
     to work 12-11 tonight i'd be all over it. having to
     leave halfway through would be too painful.

Alright kidz, I lied. My stagnantly slow roommate has *yet* to bring our
computer down to Lexington. Nonetheless...it *ought* to be there sometime soon
so hopefully I will be able to get in the swing of posting again. 

Anyways...hope everyone is havin' fun partying whilst I am studying away ;) I
just picked up a double major and I'm spending the majority of my time praying
to the guidance couseling gods to let me out in four years. We'll see....

don't forget me while I'm gone...this kitten is still kickin :)

<3 HoUsKiTteN

...you're on geekboy...we'll meet up at some party sooner or later :) Looking
forward to it.

     i'm there. i mean, with two free tix, who wouldn't be? :]
     i also got their new single, which is pretty nice. the 
     other people who'll be playing, lunatic calm, aren't bad
     at all. basically ambient electronica-noise, similar to
     god lives under water but with more rythm and less 
     strangeness. their new album is called 'metropol' which 
     is pretty odd. but anyway. be there.

Yeah, number one does stand out (the design), but I like the saying "Regional

Based on reading about the scene in Washington, Atlanta, Detroit and New
York over the past few months from this and other lists, it just makes me
realize that *we are in the right place*!!!

I'm sometimes down on Cleveland/Pittsburgh because I assume that it's
better elsewhere merely due to the size of some of these other cities.
Well, over and over again, I'm learning that what we have here is very
special.  The vibe is tight and the quality of the music is high.

Who knows, perhaps we have the best scene in America!  Lately, I'm
beginning to feel that way -- time, space, crystallized2, phuncktion,
phorm, liquid, just to mention a handful . . . these were fantastic
parties.

Hi Everyone

Here is the final tour dates before we hit the road next week...


Sept 15 : Vancouver (Sonar)
Sept 16 : Victoria (Vertigo)
Sept 18 : Seattle (Aro Space - early show)
Sept 18 : Seattle (Beatbox - late show)
Sept 19 : Portland (Zootsuite)
Sept 21 : San Franciso (Justice League)
Sept 22 : L.A (Atlas)
Sept 23 : Denver (Lo Do Music Hall)
Sept 24 : Baltimore (Fletches)
Sept 25 : Washington (Capital Ballroom)
Sept 27 : Philadelphia (New Market Cabaret)
Sept 28 : NY (Cooler)
Sept 30 : Ann Arbour (Blind Pig)
Oct 1 : Boston (Lansdown Playhouse)
Oct 2 : Montreal (Isart Gallery)
Oct 3 : Toronto (Weave : this might change, but is pretty definite)
Oct 4 : Chicago (House of Blues)

***note for Montreal...we've had to move the show at the last minute. Due 
to the limited capacity of the venue (275 people) we are already 
guaranteed to lose mad-loot on this show, so we must apologize in advance 
for those this effects, but there will be no guest list for this show. 
Even the Ninja staff is paying.

well 3D was alright....not quite dancable, but quallity non the less......but
where were people i mean there was some new heads there but they kinda just
stuck together in the corner and left early...now i have to scold the everyday
scj crew(myself definately included) these kids showed up and we ignored them
groups like neo nazis embrace newcomers and treat them like brothers and make
them feel secure and welcome but the rave scene and all of its plur bull shit
is really just one big clique... i had a great time dont get me wrong
.......but in retrospect it really bothers me that we may have wasted an
oppertunity to draw much needed patrons to scj...oh well

In yet another of a series of diversions to avoid responsability:

I started a TShirts page off of my pages at tripod.
The link is
http://members.tripod.com/~dschwanke/PbCleTShirts.html

It just has links Geoffry's and Phillip's designs. Since the archives arent up yet I couldnt check if there were other designs.

If someone wants to maintain a better page be my guest.

Heh. Sent a little fast. 
I meant to also suggest:

We set a deadline for tshirt submissions.
Decide how many versions we want to have (and who is making/paying for them btw)
Do a finalists vote (vote for your x favorite designs).
Do a final vote (out of the finalists vote for your favorite design, top whatever are the designs.

Any more ideas?

For your information:

The Downlow info. line will now have a weekly trivia question.  The
first person to correctly answer will win a mix-tape, record, CD, or
other notable prize. Ooooooooo.  Ahhhhhhhh.

We'd like people to use info. lines as a means of staying connected with
what's going on and to encourage promoters to supply solid, up-to-date
information for their callers.  We figured this was a good first step to
promote frequent calling.

Check it out and let us know what you think.

hey kids!

just wanted to post an email i sent to a friend which was basicly a
review of the show tonight...

i'd love to hear what anybody else that was there thought of it as well.

shout-outs to all of the list kids i saw: jeff c. (thanks for the
ride!), jeff b. (thanks for the ride offer),
geekboy (ditto, and thanks for the zines), dave s. (even though i didn't
see you, thank you *so* much for
hooking my friend up with a ride), hey_you (almost didn't recogznize you
again without that damn tophat),
josh 'b gosh, pat friend, and y'sey (the guy that does the awesome video
mixing at atomic)... if i missed
anyone, i'm sorry!!

anyway, onto the review...

 well, first off, i knew going into it that it was going to be weird. in
other
words, i didn't jade myself or waste my money by thinking it was going
to be
something that it wasn't. what i didn't expect, or maybe more precisely
what i
didn't want to believe, was the sheer level of commercialism that has
built up
around the crystal method over the past year. the show at graffiti last
year was
lots of fun. the majority of the crowd were party kids (friendly ones at
that) and
people actually danced (and had room to do it)... also, the opening acts
were
decent and fit the genre of music that was being performed...  (even
though sine
and 187 played jungle, it was still 'electronica'...)

    so, okay, there was that show... *then*, there was the shit that
went on
tonight. i know that you're probably going to be sitting there saying,
'i could
have told you that...' the whole time you're reading this, but it pissed
me off
and i need to tell someone who knows what the hell i'm talking about. :
)

(keep in mind this was a personal email to somebody else. my grammar
isn't *that* bad. : >  )

    here's the scenario: you walk into metropol. on your right is a huge
console
holding demos on sony's new playstation game featuring, guess who: 'the
crystal
method'... *bad thing number 1*  on your right, as with any concert, is
the
oh-so-lovely t-shirt stand carrying the popular 'got meth?' logo on it.
*bad thing
number 2*  just when i thought things couldn't get any worse, i started
to walk
around.. what do i see? club kids galore and lots and lots of preppy
dudes who
keep screaming, 'YEAH!! FUCKIN' CRYSTAL METH!'

    anyway, you get the idea. i'm sure you would have left by now, but i
was
slightly interested in the new stuff that they had been working on.
before i could
hear that, i had to hear the opening act: 'lunatic clan'  never heard of
them? :
>  me either?  anyway, think 2 angst ridden guys in their 20's from the
uk. their
'act' consisted of them waiting for the sound guy (who they would nod
to) start a
dat or maybe a sequencer and then they would pretend to play along on
some very
nice roland and yamaha keyboards. as if that wasn't enough excitement,
the one
dude would sing (he actually did sing, or tried to at least...) my
favorite part
was the drummer they had.. he would play along with the drums that they
already
had programmed into the mix. that was a nice touch, especially
considering that he
didn't even arrive till the third song.

    as for the main act of the night, they weren't much better than
their opening
act. for real, these guys really went down hill since the last time i
saw them.
they went from actually performing a good percentage of their stuff
live, to
starting a sequener and occasionally playing some acidy 909 sounds over
top of it
live. at one point, ken picked the keyboard up over his head and held a
chord in
for a good few minutes and when he took his hands off the keys the chord

mysteriously kept playing by itself. sorry, but shit like that is just
fucking
bullshit. if i ever become make it big doing a techno pa and i do
anything even
remotely close to that, please remind me to go shoot myself. their new
stuff
wasn't that great either. they have the same rhythm structure to just
about every
song and a whole cd of that shit is going to be awful.


well, there's my take on it... : >

i gotta get some sleep. g'nite!

peace,

--spike

p.s. if anybody gets a chance and is around the oakland area,
specifically the pitt campus area, pick up a
copy of 'impulse'.. it's a nice little entertainment publication that
pitt news puts out and the current edition
features a quite nicely done cover story on raves by geekboy... he also
used pictures donated by several
people on the list.. i saw a few from don of wizard workshop, one from
hossam, and the one they stuck on
the cover was one i took at biz... anyway, its definately worth checking
out.

     [warning, this gets really long and rambling. read at own risk]

     well, since i'm sitting here in the computer lab without
     a hell of a lot to do except surf the net and play with a new
     dishwalla multimedia CD i stole from my editor, i might as 
     well try to piece together a few thoughts on the crystal 
     method show.

     it seems i learn more and more about human nature and about
     the scene with each sucessive party, and i have to say 
     that these last few experiences is more info than i really
     want to have to process right away.

     but it's there, somewhere - what to say?

     to understand where i was in relationship to this show, 
     you have to understand where i am or have been in relation
     to the scene, i guess. i remember when i first started working
     with NGL (before they were ngl, i guess) and was simply a 
     graphic designer for hire and pet geek, basically a 
     career engineer at pitt with my grades going down the tubes
     and a few major problems with depression. the crystal method
     was one of the acts daren wanted to have play in the crane,
     and coming from my viewpoint i could see how that was a
     good financial decision. i mean, look at last night's show.
     the place was packed. these were people who'd heard of the
     crystal method from TV commercials, from playstation games,
     from the mad hype from the people who stood to profit by this
     hip new genre.

     <cough>

     it was funny, i got comps for the show cause i wrote a
     little filler for the pitt news, and when i called sarah
     to see what had actually happened to pipeshed productions
     she was in california... ok. i guess this one got taken over
     by the establishment. that's about all i should probly say on
     that tangent. whatever. but this show was going down cause 
     the band was on TOUR. so there...

     </cough>

     so... i went into this one, basically expecting more, i guess.
     i wasn't pumped for the show, but others were, and the setup
     was pretty amazing. i missed lunatic calm, i have their new
     album and it's ok, but i'm not sure what they're trying to 
     prove. nothing i'd buy. from what i hear they were a joke.

     well, as far as the method go, i have their new single too
     (time for an album?) and while i think it might be tasty in
     a very classy club  or so it's really too overprocessed to be
     really danceable. but it's pretty. i'd like to hear it at a 
     party, to tell the truth. the vocals are just plain beautiful.

     but the show was just that - a show.

     if you wanna know WHY the method has 'degenerated' into a
     show-off pretend act, without pretending to know all their
     history, i can say it's because of crowds like tonights, and
     events like these.

     i mean, i was up front, right by the keyboards and the biggest
     security dude i've ever seen, and there was just no vibe. 
     no feeling. no connection between the crowd and the performers.
     these 'electronica' ppl have turned into rock stars, striking
     poses washed in beautiful lights (i have to say that the lights
     plus what i was on almost made me cry) and playing to drunken
     hick crowds who think they're watching TV.

     you know what i really feel like sometimes?

     i think a lot of the people who come to events like these, 
     and the club raves, etc. just want in on something they can
     never have. i mean, if i saw all these beautiful ppl, all
     having more fun than anyones ever supposed to have, dancing,
     whatever, i think i'd want to understand. there's a 'raver
     chic' that seems to be going that is as marketable as hell
     and that's what's selling out shows like the crystal method.

     or maybe that's just me. i do have flaming red hair and dress 
     in black. so ppl look at me wierd anyway.

     <smile>

     well, i dunno. the club scene is pretty evil, and the crystal
     method show was what should have been a live techno PA playing
     in a club to a bunch of jocks and metalheads. if that.

     ok, so there were some raver kids there. but i think melissa's
     response to me appearing out of the crowd should have told 
     me more about the vibe than i wanted to admit. (big virtual
     hug wherever you are, melissa). it wasn't bad, just dead.
     plain clueless. i came from pure unadulterated evil in NYC
     back to mainstream PGH and find... nothing. a few kids tried
     to get together and kick out some dance space, but it didn't
     really work.

     shouts: jbrick [thanks for providing _some_ vibe], spike, 
     schwanke [i'd like to hear your thoughts on this one], jeff 
     chung, the electrolyte crew [cause they're kewl even tho 
     they aren't listies], hey_you, and i know at least a few
     other netkids that i haven't seen before and don't remember
     because i wasn't all there.

     for future reference: hearing 'trip like i do' while, well,
     doing just that, is pretty damn awesome. having to deal with
     reality at 11pm while doing so sux. the crystal method is 
     one hell of an act, but it's packaged pretty brutally and
     is probably meant to seague pretty nicely between two 
     business days. that's a great pity, because i think i got
     the best experience anyone can expect to from this show,
     and i hate having to regret having fun.

     shows over. lights off. time to go home. time to come down.


     mebbe watch a little MTV?

     plur
     geekboy

     to comment on this last bit - this goes out every friday. 
     i have about 100 copies of last fridays (the rave story,
     pretty phat looking) in my trunk. they'll be there until
     they're gone, i guess. ask me for a copy if you're 
     interested. it was a mess, i didn't have editorial control,
     they used all the wrong pics, i didn't get the stuff in 
     that i wanted... but i'm still happy with it. 16000 chars
     i think. written way too fast.

     if i get editorial control of this paper at the end of 
     the semester (and there's nothing to stop me but myself)
     then watch it turn into an underground music/culture
     zine. if i can get by the pitt establishment - it'll
     happen.

     remember, this newspaper got me here...

     strange.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far

Sat Nov 28                        ENERGIZE                               DC

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year
history. It is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for
it to do to the dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond. It will
be held in the massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in
this space before, none will compare to the excellence of Energize.  The
main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one
wide-open, high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set
Energize apart from our previous events is that we have now been
approved to use the basement! Don't think basement like dark and dingy
though, this basement has ceilings of 40', and makes the biggest dance
clubs on the East Coast look like efficiency apartments in Manhattan.
Plus it's divided up into rooms of various sizes. For the first time at
the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all with full on
concert level production in both sound and lighting.

The rooms will be: The Main Arena: We will fill this space with the
biggest sound system we have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning
combination of lasers, projection screens and intelligent lights. We are
still waiting for final confirmation of 2 more djs and one live act, but
so far we've got:  DOC MARTIN Los Angelos ICEY Zone, Orlando SCOTT HENRY
Buzz, DC (not bad for a start)

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena: In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the
undisputed champions of the U.K. scene. This area will be hosted by 2
Tuff productions of DC. The lineup is:  GROOVERIDER Sony, Prototype,
U.K. FABIO U.K. MC GQ the U.K.'s premier MC DARA Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY Platinum, Philadelphia AK1200 Orlando DB Breakbeat Science,
NYC SLANT 2 Tuff, DC ENTITY Ultraworld FLUID Sonic Soul, Baltimore MCS
NES, MECHA, SYSTEM

The Deep House Arena: This third area, also in the basement, is bigger
then any dance club on the East Coast. It will be hosted by
Philadelphia's Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long. The performers are: DERRICK
CARTER Chicago GLOBAL COMMUNICATION Universal Language, U.K. FEELGOOD
Charm City Records, Baltimore JAVATE Dirty Crew, DC O'KEEFE Circle,
Philly ROB PAINE Circle, Philly SEAN THOMAS Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena: The smallest area of the event, but still bigger
then the main room at most clubs! This room will be hosted by
Baltimore's respected Sonic Sould crew, and will feature the downtempo
side of electronic music. You can dance if you want to, with performers:
TIM "LOVE" LEE Tummy Touch, U.K. PETE LAWRENCE the Big Chill, U.K. WE
performing live Asphodel, NYC LOVEGROVE Sonic Soul DJ C Toneburst,
Boston RHOMBUS Sonic Soul What makes this event even more exciting, is
the fact that it will be a collaborative effort between Ultraworld,
Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.

While Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction
for the event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically
manage the areas of music they are most interested in. What that means
for you is that you get the highest quality of production and care going
into every aspect of the event. Tickets will be going on sale in mid
September, and will be broken down as follows: There will be 1000
tickets sold for only $20! So if you know you're going to go, you have
the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low price. After those 1000
are gone the price will be $25 up to and including October 31.  On
November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that
price even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets. Admission at the
gate will be $35. We are compiling the list of ticket outlets now, and
in addition to the stores, tickets will be available through
Ticketmaster. So if you don't have an outlet near you, don't worry, you
will be able to purchase tickets through them. Also, we are working with
the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend. For those of you who may
not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held every Friday by DJ's
Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt. It plays host to the world's top DJ's
and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of the best in the
country. When you purchase your ticket to Energize, you will get a
coupon which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for only $5.
Consider coming to DC on Friday, and making a long stay of it. We'll
post hotel and travel info on this site in the weeks to come. After
you've had your turkey, and are over the family thing, remember, the
place to be for Thanksgiving weekend will be the nation's capital for
ULTRAWORLD ENERGIZE!

Man I cain't wait till turkey day.

if you're planning on hitting a club in a large midwest city, expect to 
see drunk hicks and club kids, sorry that's just reality.  

lunatic had a couple of good sounds, but sucked big donkey ass overall.  
too much the hardcore tough guy punks from england for me IMHO

meth was...meth.  the lights were cool, there was some good bass there, 
but overall their set just didn't sound tight.  anybody else run into 
those three annoying drunk football players there?  rrrhgghgh..

as far as the commercialism goes, fuck it.  what'd you expect?  good for 
them anyway.  I'm glad they're making money now.  I hope one day the 
shit is played in elevators and waiting rooms.  there's only 3 things I 
want to do when I go out to a jam see:  dance, and listen to some beats, 
and dance some more.    
I guess that puts me in one catagory.   like I said, good for meth.

now

good for us? got what I paid for I guess.  it was packed as hell with 
NIN shirts and hair gel flying everywhere.  it's just a different scene 
now.  dancing was out.  the beats...sure, they were jiggy when I closed 
my eyes or just paid attention to the lights.  they sure did look 
ridiculous with their Van Halenesque roland slinging though.  good to 
see once, but I won't be back.  i still think their tunes sound damn 
good, but save your money, buy'em on disc.
(but I think that's a good thing.  I think it's great to be able to 
share an interest with people I can't stand ;p ) i think meth's deal is 
that they are the are where things start to overlap.. meth makes mr. 
ultra raver watch mtv, buy gap jeans, and show up at metropol on 
wednesday nights with a bunch of yenzers. they toss the kiddies their 
first pair of glowsticks and got meth shirts, and we'll see them at 
their first 'rave' next month for whatever reason.

bottom line: it's not what I dig, but I got to dance a tiny bit and hear 
some noise.  who really cares about anything else?



keep it Veal,
compton

I've heard that raves at trilogy are not that good unless they happen on
a sunday night.  I am thinking of going to Rabbit in the moon, but I
don't want to go if is going to be a bust.  If you've been at a rave at
trilogy any other day but sunday let me know if it is worth going.
Thanks!  PLUR!

okay folks, lemme clue ya in on how t-shirt printing works.

first off, you need to find your design. i'm the official
alt.tech-support.recovery t-shirt guy, and i'm about to order the first
batch of a.t-s.r shirts.

the key is simplicity. keep the colour count low. lots seem to like the
"cyberbeatfreakz'r'us" tee. so, i call up print shop.

for 24 of those tees, it'd be $296.17

for 24 of the 'turn on, tune in, geek out' shirts, it's $230.79.

they can't print the 'oldskool reprazent' tees because they have too
many colours. which means they'd have to go to my professional print
house, which does most of my proposal stuff, and thankfully does
t-shirts.

uhm, i don't think i'd want to pay $30 for a tee with those words and a
tb-909 on it. ;( 

if you keep the colours under 6, it's usually pretty affordable (around
$9 to 12 a shirt), but when you get into complex designs, like 'oldskool
reprazent' the price just skyrockets. ;(

also, unfortunately, if we decide to go with my print house, we have to
have 24 orders of one design. can't mix and match. :(

If you're 21+ come check this night out....it was basically forced out
because of too much tuesday night action, which sucks because its the only
night clubs seem to be willing to 'experiment'  (....not true with NATO on
fridays, but that's an odd exception).  
-cutup

---
All good things must come to an end.  As much fun as DJing Digital at 
The Pollinator has been for myself and those who attended, it's time 
to close that chapter.

Those who are 21+ are invited to join me and guest DJ Dr. Cut-Up for 
the final Digital, which will be (as always) at The Pollinator in 
Oakland on Tuesday, September 15.  Dr. Cut-Up (who can be heard on 
WPTS) will likely be spinning gabber, happy hardcore, industrial, and 
other hard crazy stuff.

Incidentally: I am open to the possibility of moving Digital to a new 
venue, although I'm not actively looking.  Contact me if you've got 
an "in" anywhere.

Feel free to forward this post anywhere appropriate.

I went, started in front but moved to the back to have room to dance. Yes
I was dissapointed by many things, but I think a big part of this is like
da grasshoper's message conveys is 'exposure' *ta-ching*  So hopefully
those kids who do go to the next party dont emulate the football types but
rather us hardcore massive!
Smiles to all those beet geeks I saw that made it worthwhile!!

Thanks for all the reviews of Crystal Method.  So, a lot of club chicks
were there, huh? Ya!! I'm there, babeee!

Seriously, I'm going if only because it's a good venue.  I saw them last
time at the Odeon and it sucked.  Everything sucks at the Odeon, though.
Please don't anyone ever use that space for a party.  It reminds me of a
dungeon.

The Agora, though, is a fine spot.  It's got a little history to it too
(4.20, 7.20 and the Orb, among others).  I expect it to be less of a frat
party and more of a hybrid event (ie you guys better show up!).

Who's with me?

Braden

I have been in the scene since 1992, and yeah, I could play out, but 
because lack of a CAR, and since Hardcore isn't exactly popular, it is 
perfect for me and a few others who do.

Anyway, when there is a party, I usually want to give a tape to the 
promoters, because next time, who knows?  This is K. with the lights in 
case you haven't guessed, a.k.a. DJ K.A.L.I.  

Remember kids, Big doesn't always mean better!

Well, I have been going to trilogy for various events, including "raves", for
a long time. Most recently, many of us on this list went to Phorm, at Trilogy,
on Saturday, August 15th, and it was a lot of fun (anyone want to chime in?).
What did you hear about that  made them "not so good unless they happen on a
Sunday night"?  Whats not good, the music? the people? the cost? I will
definitely agree that depending on the night you go (for a regular night of
music) it is a definite gamble with the mix of people and prices. Generally,
Sunday is the night to go if you want to hear "rave" type music and see "rave"
type/looking people (please forgive me if I am sounding stereotypical, I just
dont know how else to say this!). If it is a planned night/party/rave,
however, it is almost guaranteed to be the same music as any other rave you
would go to, since you have dj's that would be at another venue if they werent
at trilogy that night.  The people are mixed, because after all, you are at a
club, and we have discussed this issue ad-nauseum, in my opinion, so I wont
any further. 

I plan to attend Rabbit in the Moon next Saturday (the 19th) at Trilogy. Its
really close to my house, and I LOVE RITM....great combination. 
Peace...Casey

I'm Dave.
It seems there is a dry spell in Cleve.
No parties till Sept 25???
I'll have to settle for the Avenue (Kent)

Liquid was awesome, as some have said.
I wasn't too happy with the music, but
it was really fun.  My homey was in the
yellow shirt throwin down in front of 
all those tv's.
Cool:  Adam Beyer's Code Red was spun, I have that record!
Bad:  My roll sucked.

The Illinois party was fun I heard, complete
with lake swimming!
I don't think my car would've made it though.

Enough list pollution for me.

Bye!  	-Dave

RITM in the back of Sanford & Son's Trash Truck is worth seein'...
(IMHO obviously!)...

granted, when i wuz livin in cleveland, i got tired of the same o same 
o also (especially when u started going to trilogy when it 1st opened 
up!)...but dag, slaggin on trilogy as a saturday night venue is just
ludicrous...perhaps yur choice of words wuz a bit off, cuz the chances 
of a party gettin 'busted' @ trilogy is next to nil since trilogy is a legal 
venue...a legal venue w/ smooth floors, clean bathrooms, proper lights, 
thumpin sound, 2 floors, 2 side rooms, 5 bars, and so on...as a legal venue 
its bar none...for me its like returnin to da source...this is where alotta
kidz got their start (whether they'd like to admit it or not)...

...perhaps yur concern wuz of the turnout...that of course is up to the kids
themselves...of all the live techno live acts out there, without question
RITM is definitly one of the best out there...their last showing in cleveland
@ the agora (props to the spawntaneous kidz) wuz da bomb-diggity...alotta
kids were a bit dismayed since the price tag wuz $20 dat night (yur gettin
a bargain @ trilogy since usually u'd hafta drop $25 atleast nowadaze to see 
'em anywhere else - $40 in detroit / $30 @ April Foolz 2)...but all da true 
kidz knew what up...and RITM did not dissapoint...by the end of the night
EVERYONE understood...you just gotta have faith...but i guarantee you as 
far as personification of what the scene truley is about no other live act
carries a vibe like Bunny and Rabbit In the Moon...you'll just have to see 'em
to TRULEY understand...it's a spiritual thing...

be that as it may, anyone goin up ta see 'em from crAkron?

here's my two pennies for the t-shirts......i would almost like a combo w/
http://ww4.choice.net/~edisc/edisc_pb-cle01.jpg on the back and
http://www.nls.net/mp/prj/pbcleraves-ttg.jpg on the front.....i think they're
both worthy....the second one is a bit "classier" but the first is more
"alive".....combining the two would make a kick ass T....just my humble
opinion though.....but let me know the who what when where and how about
getting one sent my way as soon as it all gets worked out.

peace

Give the boy a ride!  Right before he gets in your car, give him a huge

REAL raves never happen at Trilogy on a Sunday. For the last 7 years
we have been open as the Church on Sunday. On holiday weekends,
the management calls it "Labor Rave" or "Memorial Rave" etc... and there
have been guest DJ's and whatnot also.
The last two raves I went to there were on a Friday and a Saturday so
I don't think the night matters. Both were excellent parties and there were
a lot of positive posts on this list about them.
Now, I'm not saying Sundays aren't fun, but it depends on what kind of
crowd decides to show up each week and how they act.
As for RITM, it's the day after Crystal Method so I'm not sure how well
it will do.

Vicious Circle & Sphere present...
         " Barely Legal "
Friday October 16th, 1998  -  Cleveland, Ohio
  
The line-up and further details on this event will be posted soon... But
this Brian's (the man behind Sphere) 21st birthday party! The space to
this event is of limited capacity and pre-sale tickets will be offered
but no-one without a ticket will be admitted!!! We are funding this event
completely and Brian wants this to be for true heads only, who show love,
give out hugs, and want to groove until the lights come on. It's his
birthday and we don't want annoying club goers, groups of nonecks, and
flat out trouble makers. That is why we are selling tickets for 10$ to
select people. Now of course anyone on this list is allowed to go, but
must still present a ticket for admission. More details will be posted
very shortly, so stay tuned...You can get into contact with Sphere at
216.556.2982, and details will be updated frequently.
peace.
 Vicious Circle Productions

Sphere - 216.556.2982

also the next Sphere event will be on Saturday, December 26th in
Cleveland...

i've been to trilogy twice this summer - once on a friday and once on a
saturday.  it was fantastic.  

i haven't been ashamed to admit it before ... i like clubs.  you can all talk
shit about me, but hey i like knowing where the bathroom is.  and knowing that
there is going to be running water.  and couches.  (metropol, in pittsburgh,
finally has the velvet lounge open on thursdays.)  sorry, but i just like
having somewhere clean to sit.  and then you know regulars.  i know it has its
minuses also but i like the plusses.

go to trilogy.

Well, I WAS gonna go to the Avenue tonite,
so I got my car from the parking lot.
Whilst in my car, I decided to take
that short drive to Fame.
(Gots ta git me a new hat)

The hats weren't great, so I was putzin 
around listening to records and stuff.
Suddenly this dude busts in.
He's really cool.
I think his name was Darius.
He seemed down, and he said he didn't want
to DJ anymore.
Although I felt like an ass, I flipped 
through his records.
I picked out 14 that ruled.
I knew I couldn't buy all of em, 
cuz I only had 30 bones.
He flipped thru the pile of 14, then
said I could take em all for
$30!
Here's my haul:

DJ Sneak (Cajual)
DJ Sneak- Hide from Bud
Underground Construction-SubSonic Funkadelic
UC- Rick Garcia
UC- BamBam, "Butta"
Buffalo Bunch- Buffalo Club
Armand Van Helden- Funk Phenomena
Afrika Bambaataa- Planet Rock 98
Dance Mania:Dj Urban- Urban Disturbance
Eddie Amador- House Music
DanceMania:Deeon Does DanceMania
CZR- Chicago Southside
CZR- On That Vibe
ESP-SUN: Southside Reverb

I owe him big time!
I'm happy as fuc!

Sorry so long...

Ok, over the summer I worked with a damned
cool kid named Jason S.
He asked me if I was a party kid once
and I of course said yes.
He handed me a flyer for Nocturnal
Emissions, and I about flipped.
It turned out that he is from Teknova.
Although he is cool as hell,
Teknova parties are a bit pricey.
They usually turn out well, however...
This seems to comply with info
supplied here.

J is supposed to get me a mix tape soon.
He got a MC 505, and is tearin shit up.
Like I said, he rules.

well here's my short take on soulslinger tonite...

He showed up around 12:45 and had a bit of a rough start, he was really
thorwing down some hard, hard jungle... very fast - wore a lot of people
out, but after about 20mins he really started going off, it was really cool
(although i wish he had played more slower stuff like on his cd, but still
very good).. the only thing was he left around 2:15, so it was disappointing
to only hear him for an hour and a half after he flew here from new york, im
not sure if it was because there werent many people left after 2(last call
at 2) or if he was just scheduled for that small set.  I hope he comes back
and plays again.  It was cool, had a everyone moving, whether they were
dancing on the floor or just dancing in their seats.  Definitely worth the
$8 cover charge though...

Question...
Does anyone out there know WHO is having/throwing RITM?  There is no
production/promotion company listed, and I KNOW its not Rob Sherwood.  As a
matter of fact, Rob has "disowned" the event altogether because of the
promoter, but he didnt mention who it was. Just curious... -Casey-

Thanks to all of you for the feedback on my question.  From all the replies I
gather that raves there are ususally pretty good, so I am definetly going to
"Rabbit in the Moon", and probably "Rhythm" too.  PLUR!

Ok so there are no parties this weekend :(
For ALL AGES at Club Laga tonight is "The Dreaming" the centerpiece of
which is the Miss Gothic Pittsburgh Pageant. So there are gonna be a few
cuties both male and female involved.
Plus for your $10 of admission you get to hear a band that I really like
called the Cruxshadows who don't ignore the beauty of electronica by any
means.  They put on a great live show and you will not be dissapointed
(unless you are the kind perhaps that thinks 4 hours of Steel City Jungle
is just not enough *wink*)
Double plus dj -brian will be spinning as well so for those of you who
have been unable to get into his 21+ nights at the pollinator can get a
chance to hear his industrial mix of beatz.
SO if you can come and represent ravah style :-)
plur :-)
jbrick

PS I hear the MC for the pageant is a hottie as well

PPS Just can't get that aerobicize song that Scott Henry spins outta my
head, HELP!!!

Club LAGA
2nite!
7pm!

I am kind of new to the rave scene, and I really REALLY want to get a
hold of some of the songs I've heard at the events I've been.  My
question:  Does anybody know where I can get REAL Techno cd's or tapes?
You can't get anything good at any record store I've been too.  Nothing
but comercial stuff.  Let me know where I can go and get stuff from real
Techno DJ's. Please.


Sincerely

Enrique.

ok - this might help you guys out:
i was @ hypervinyl + some guy was listening to it. it was a full cover
sleeve with  a 70's looking ad for some sorta sexual aid ("increase
sexual potency" or something of the sort) on the back. might be a
double pack... i dunno. call up the store, they are likely to be able
to pinpoint it for ya.

and yeah - it kicks ass.

hahaha...
I just got this game that i must share with people.
its called "Ganja Farmer".
Its incredibly entertaining.
Basically, you sit on top of a 1960's VW minibus with your shotgun, 
and shoot down paratrooper federal agents trying to distroy your crops.
The sound FX and background music are hilarious.

Lemme know if you want a copy and i'll put it online.

Also, if you want to spin, bring yo rekkids.  Don (Wizard Workshop) has 
kindly donated some sound equipment for us to use.  Circuit 6 will be 
throwing down a set especilally for the pb-cle crew, and i'm pretty sure 
DJ bob is gonna drop by and lay down some funky breaks for us. (If i 
could get ahold of his punk-ass!!!) The festivities begin at 12:00 noon 
and will go until 10pm or whenever everybody leaves, whichever comes 
first.  also, any food or beverage items that anybody wishes to bring 
will be much appreciated.  c-yas on sunday!!!

also, i got my pix back from liquid (including two really nice netmeet
pix) and i have them scanned. i'll be posting the url as soon as i get a
site together for them... i'll put my review up too then! (btw, where
are all the reviews from that party?? the 'people that were there' to
'people that posted a review' ratio wasn't all that high.. what gives?

Well, this show was definitely different than the parties I'm used to
going to for one obvious reason; Crystal Method has become mainstream
music.  Tho as others pointed out there was a wide variety of people
there, it didnt matter all that much to me.  Though there was no vibe
whatsoever, I enjoyed the music and had a pretty good time.  Sure it
would have been nice if the people there had been really down with the
scene and not out to see Crystal Method because they heard about them
from a friend or a car commercial, but hey these things happen.  I did
see a couple people from the list; spike, geekboy, and jbrick, so that
was cool. All in all, I had a fun time.

Josh

Ok, I'll try this again. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I'm wondering if there are any weeklies for a 17 year old kid like me. If
not, I 
want to know if there are any phat parties or something going down. I'll
be taking
people that have never been to a rave before, so it's gotta be a good
party.

later.

Well first off Mr. Rab no hard feelings.  I looked for you but didn't find
you.  My friends actually took a road trip and picked me up.  
LIQUID--  Great net-meet!! I finally got to meet a large number of you and
talk.  It was a very good time.  Have the pictures been posted yet?  Matt
thanks for getting it all together once again.  Thankz also for keeping my
spirits up when I thought that all was lost=)  I hope you all had fun at the
afterhours!!
EASY--  DC has a very big DRINKING scene.  Because of its location and all the
schools that are around the area.  The place where EASY was held  happens to
be one of Joe Frat boys' favorite places.  Its owned&run by people that luv to
drink.  So when you place a bunch of party kids in a situation like this
things get crazy.  I don't believe that the security had ever worked this type
of event. I do believe they watched the infamous 20/20 report on RAVES.  The
security sucked!! I think the DEVIL himself picked out these fu*kas!!  I got
strip searched, and like half of my friends.  They had this little area
cleared out and if they felt like it they would empty your pockets and
sometimes have you drop your pants!!! WTF!!!!  
  I think that the LDopah people had a vision in mind( like all promoters)
when they began to plan EASY.  I just don't think the place they wanted it
tobe in was the right one.  The rooms were to small and HOT!!!  The music and
the line up was PHAT!!  Running up and down those stairs sucked.  TY T spun an
outstanding set!!  My soul was on fire!!  If anyone wants copies of his tapes
let me know! You have to hear this to believe it!!  Tom B., DC favorite speed
garage DJ blew the roof off.  I danced the entire set!  DJ Smallz fresh off
his victory of DJ O' the year laid down some sweeet breakz before ELECTRIC
SKYCHURCH!  I  haven't been to a live performance of E.S.C since Ultraworld
Phoenix.  That night forever changed my life.  She sounds and looks like and
~ANGEL~.  I was a little dissapointed that they didn't play any new songs but
it was still great.  The room was little and hot and cramped but MAN!!! 
  I miss DC even more now, but I'm ready now to begin sharing my happiness
with others.  Its been rough moving back here.  This whole summer has been bad
for me.  My father died, I left all my friends behind etc.  But something
happened this week while I was away.  I guess I can finally  move on and live
life the way I used to.=)  I've had the chance to talk to some of you more
than others and I really appreciate the time we've spent.  I look forward to
making old friendships stronger and start new  ones.  

Much love to all of ya'll!!

Hey everyone,
     I have started gathering pictures to put up on our website.  If anyone
has any good pictures (crowd shots or kids dancing) from any of our parties -
(Time, Space, Phunktion, Liquid), could you please send them to me?

    Also, on our webpage, i have the design for the front of the flyer up for
continuum.  if you have nothing better to do, go to
http://members.aol.com/Shortarm5, and tell me what you think of the design.

thanks,
Lou

look, bad shit can happen to you if you just take any old cough syrup
off the shelf and drink it. (like, you could overdose on acetomenephin
and fuck your liver up) you should read the dxm faq so that you know
what you're doing. (just do a net search.)

so what is this anyways?  if it's a tour i guess they do the same show every
night?  is the music continuous or do they play "songs"?  no turnables i
guess?  i get the impression from what i've heard that it's just like ... um,
"lipsynching" (er, keyboard equivalent).

i saw moby at metropol a couple years ago.  it wasn't like a tour, say for
promoting a new release, but just a show.  i think he had two roland keyboards
and a 303.  he was really playing stuff - like, he took requests and it seemed
to me like he was making the noises and passing them through filters,
sequencing, looping, sampling, tweaking, squelching, delaying, whatever that
stuff is called.  so it didn't sound like it did on his cd's.

um ... i don't know where i was going with that?  it's supposed to tie in with
the crystal method somehow.

     they basically sequenced through their 'vegas'
     album, a little more, not much less. no tables,
     sickening racks of silicon. two main boards,
     which i neglected to identify, and a separate
     set of two that i think were used for triggering.
     a lot of _very_ sexy hardware, but not all that
     much to show for it. no keyboard solos, no phatty
     dripping 303, no cute piano segues. eh.

     um, it was a little closer to vanilli than wonder,
     unfortunately. i wasn't close enough to really
     pick out details, the crowd and chemicals banished
     me to a spot of lesser aggression. plus those 
     monster strobes were giving me twitches...

     i think spike pretty much summed it up. there 
     was a lot of mock showmanship. 

     they play _every_ night, tho. how can you do a 
     live PA _every_ night, to a tube-fed crowd who 
     think glowsticks are for waving?

     sign of the times: posted on the walls of 
     metropol (i took one home with me) it said - 
     "per the crystal method's request, moshing will
      not be permitted. if you mosh, you will be 
      ejected."

     they ejected two people. 

    -geeky

As most of you know, I am no longer in the Pittsburgh-Cleveland area.  I
currently reside in the college town of Bloomington, Indiana.  Lucky me.
Anyways, I went to an Indy party last night.  Quite remeniscent of
Pittsburgh parties of yore.  It was also the best party I've been to since
LIBAD (okay, the only).  It was still really great!  

1.  Walking in there were TONS of black lights!!  I was extra glowy 
	because of my white rag curls and glowy clear glowy nail polish
	(courtesy mskw).
2.  Great lights!
3.  DJs I didn't know (brought me back to my baby raving days)
4.  People I didn't know (see #3)
6.  A gorgeous glowing man gave me a stick of gum.
5.  NO SMOKING!!!!!!!!!  Wahoo!  For once I didn't have to share in the 
 	death sticks of cancer bound ravers.  Oh joy. I didn't smell like
	smoke when I came home, just sweat.  Oh joy!!

There should ALWAYS be black lights at parties.  Black lights and strobe
lights.  Wahoo!!

I'm very happy.

Jeez, I've been a partygoer for some time and a geek for even longer.  Just
never thought to combine the two.  Here I am, tho.  I have a few things to
say:

1. Liquid rocked, at least in my mind.  I had a lot of fun, mainly because I
finally know enough clevers (clevites?  clevlandkateers?) to have people to
talk to.

2. If anyone out there will give me a couch after a party and introduce me
to all of your friends at that party, I will do my level best to fix any
problems with your computer.  (I'm pretty qualified, I fix some of NASA's
computers in real life)

3. If anyone out there knows or lives with alethia or paul (both from
cleveland, both were at liquid)  Please get in touch.  I know this isn't the
most apropos venue, but I can't find any other way to contact either of
them.

                THX1138,
                    Paul (Poe)

The best way to describe mekka is "a cleaner version of Trilogy" or "a cross
between trilogy and metropol".   I was recently at metropol, so I can safely
say that I agree with that statement.

Hey, it's fun stuff! You wouldn't think that something legal could
be that interesting, but it is. In ways, it's weirder than acid. 
Right, Steve?

It would be safe to assume, then, that you have never experienced the
space/time travel that is DXM.  

Said to be 'sorta like' ketamine or PCP on higher doses, however
without the possible risks of becoming unconscious (ketamine), or of
the brain damage that can result from regular or frequent PCP use.

According to the hyperreal.org faq, there are 4 levels for DXM.  If you're
shooting for the more disassociative ones, you're going to have to find
ways of dealing with all the bad stuff they put in the cough syrup to make
you vomit or feel nauscious (sp?).  Please be careful before doing this
especially if you are taking any medication (especially MAO inhibitors or
asthma stuff).  I would add SSRI's to the list too.  The anti-hystimines
in the cough syrup could literally kill you in combination with these
drugs in larger doses.  

Actually, it's a great idea for everyone on this list to investigate the
hyperreal section on drug faq's.  You'll learn a great deal!

Braden dear,

Thank you for your concern for my safety, and let me assure you that I
have had many safe trips on DXM thanks to the best DXM site in the
world,

www.frognet.net/DXM

And of course I would never stoop to drinking the syrup ... ordering
pure powder off the internet and making my own capsules has worked
very well, and if I'm in a pinch, Coricidin Cough and Cold capsules
(about 16 of them), will suffice (although the antihistamines mess up
my ability to talk a little bit).

Take care,
Amanda

I used to do that shit,  Was doing vicks 44d for a while too.  cause we were
always gettin free shit from Dairy mart where my freind here in canton used to
work.  We used to loot that place mad.  We took almost every last peice of
candy and brought it to intimate a ways back.  I don't get that desperate ne
more though.  Another thing I used to do like two years ago was motion
sickness pills, take about 10 to 12 of those suckers and you hullucinate like
you have never imagend,  hearin voices and shit.  Crazy. I dont suggest doing
this often but its worth experiencing it a couple times.

Whoa, you people are bored.

Cough syrup?  Motion sickness drugs?  I'm sorry but I just don't
understand.  It seems like you'll try anything for a high.  I sound like a
commercial.  I wish I was Christy Turlington.

i don't really understand what your problem could be. it kinda baffles me to
see someone so drug-judgemental in a scene where it's use is so prominent
it honestly seems to me that if they were Schedule II controlled substances
that were sold in little capsules your viewpoint might be a little
different...
anyhow, some people enjoy it and it doesn't seem to be dangerous when used
responsibly (which is true of most substances, i dunno much about motion
sickness stuff except that it has more associated risks than cough syrup)
an it harm none, do what thou whilst

I just finished up a hella busy weekend, got back from the office at 2:30,
fell onto the futon, and flipped on the tv... now usually Mtv is locked
out of my television, so I've never seen Amp or whatever else they play
nowadays.. but I was flipping through channels and all of a sudden my
thunderous bass starts emanating from my subwoofers and some
crudely-rendered rocketship is flying across the screen... after a couple
seconds I realize, wait a minute, _I_have_this_record_..! They're playing
Doof's Mars Needs Women on Mtv! Why are they playing Doof?? of course, as
the video ends some women comes on and starts detailing the problem with
"elektronica" and why Puff Daddy is cooler than the Chemical Bros.. 
Needless to say I promply locked Mtv out again... 

But Mtv played Doof!!  Right on!!! Stay up forever!!

Is this the same DJ Spooky that used to have records on Guerilla Records? 
What does he sound like now?  How about EBN?  I haven't even heard about

The fact that so many people are so grumpy about the drugs they do (or say
they do) and the lines that are drawn between those drugs really amuses
me.  I don't think I'm being judgemental as far as distinguishing between
a drug that can be bought over the counter for common illnesses and drugs
most commonly taken at parties called raves.  I couldn't really care less
which one a person takes because I honestly think they're ALL stupid.
There, NOW you can call me judgemental.  

It disgusts me.  I hate being hugged by people that are rolling or
tripping because it feels false and sacchrine sweet.  I hate it when 
people can't hold a decent conversation because all they can say is
"whoa", or "cool", or "hey", or you can't even understand them because
they can't quite seem to form the words.  I hate the blank looks when you
talk to them or even look at them.  So that's it in a nut shell.  Maybe
you're a very nice person when you're sober.  Of course, then again, maybe
you're not and that's why you're in a drugged state in the first place.   

Go ahead and flame me.  I don't care.  This is my opinion and I stick by
it. It seems everyone else is entitled.

I see it as actually getting smarter!  One cant learn from mistakes unless
they make them right?  We are all smart, but after drugs we become more
perceptive, or I would like to put it, we become gods.  So....think of all
your expirences with over the counter medicine, in larger quantities, a stupid
thing to do, but a smart way to learn.  This entire letter sounds retarded, I
would assume it is due to the lack of drugs.....its time for me to go to
Wallgreens.  :)

well, the way i look at it, there may be a "safe" way to do drugs, but i 
have yet to see an "intelligent" manner to do drugs.....i have yet to 
see positive results from drug use....and i dont like letting people on 
e touch me.....its really dissapointing to think about the sheer number 
of people who cant (or choose not to) have fun at a party without 
drugs.....ive been to a grand total of 3 raves while i was intoxicated, 
and i brought nothing outstanding back from them...the first time i was 
at a rave not tripping, i had a fucking blast...i guess the drugs dont 
even realy bother me that much anymore, but theyre one of the main

Hi gang, It was great to be able to meet with everyone, especially since I am
more or less new to the rave scene.  It would be wonderful if we could get
more promoters out to get-togethers like the Bar-B-Q.  Maybe we could get some
grass root rave thing going on.  I remember that there was a phat party in the
burg at least once a month (I know because I helped move Don's sound system in
and out of the space).  So, what happen in Pittsburgh.  I know that Cleveland
and Columbus are party towns.  Well, anyway I know if we all got together on a
regular basis we could have a party like Interglatic Circus at least once a
month.  Getting back to the point of this post, my friend Don and I would like
to thank Andythepooh for his hospitality.  I hope everything worked O.K. for
Henry.  I can't wait for the next party...I hope to see all of you spinin or
cutten loose on the dance floor...Peace...{:-] mark

well, this viewpoint has a lot more merit than "why drink cough syrup when
you could be doing *real* drugs"
it is important to realise that most people take drugs for personal
experiences, and they are quite willing to forfeit intelligent social
interaction for them |P  most drugs don't just insert a new personality
(or lack thereof) into a person, but rather reveal different aspects of
them. so next time someone gives you one of those false hugs, try to
imagine it as their attitude once you strip away all of their barriers and
inhibitions. of course we've all seen the walking drug-husks that are too
busy in their own little full-time world to have much to offer, but that's
just a testament to responsibility 
i'm not flaming or attacking, just trying to defend people's rights to
chug syrup, pop pills, or express they're opinion against it. and
hopefully help people understand and respect differing viewpoints.
for my information, are you completely straightedge, and if so, have you
always been?

there is a difference between Using and Abusing.  For the few who wish to
experience drugs, then thats great!  And for the other few that dont want to
touch them, thats great too!  It is all about personal expirences, and what
people want out of them.  Raves are all about having fun!  Drugs or no drugs,
just dont let them become an excuse!  I am not the preaching type so I will
shut up now...

What ever happened to the R in PLUR?  Miss Jenifer Foulmood claims that she doesn't like
the drugs, or interacting with people on drugs.  Jennifer, I agree that you don't have
to be on drugs to enjoy a party but why do you have to judge others that choose to do
so?  That is their prerrogative if they want to or not and you and everybody else should
respect that fact that that is that person's choice.

I thought that's what PLUR is about.  Jennifer I hope you enjoy yourself at raves, but
please don't go around putting other people down because you don't agree with what they
do, and if you can't do that then maybe you shouldn't go to raves at all.

     i'm glad you're able to put your feelings into
     words, instead of just being incoherently angry, as
     seems to happen in the 'net world, often...

     i respect your opinion. you know me personally, and
     i like you a lot. but i don't agree with you, entirely.

     certainly, drug abuse is stupid, destructive, and
     disgusting. especially alcohol abuse, BTW.

     however, i refuse to condemn any sort of drug use
     at all, because, for one, it would be hypocritical
     (even done ether? paint thinner?) and for another,
     i think drugs can be both wonderful and valuable.

     i would be dead right now if it wouldn't be for 
     the drugs used in modern surgery. i would still be
     a cerebral, incomplete, and unremarkable recluse
     if it wouldn't be for the drugs used in modern
     recreation.

     i draw no lines. i judge no one. what you do is
     your own business, and if you aren't smart enough
     to distinguish between use and abuse then you 
     probably won't listen to me.

     speaking of lines... 

     :P

Damn, this is a bit harsh.  I understand that people might want to parties 
sober (I'm definately headed in that direction).  Still, I thought one of
the key principles of the rave culture was acceptance of different ideas
and people.  Are people that are rolling/tripping their asses off actually
causing you that much emotional stress?  Perhaps you should judge people
by their actions and not the chemicals in their bodies.  Saying that hugs
from rolling people are fake seems really ignorant to me.  I am completely
sober right now but i can say that I still have and will always have an
intense love for friends that I have raved (and yes, perhaps rolled) with
over the years.  If people are brought together by music or e does that
mean that their being happy in each other's presence is fake?  If so then
perhaps a great deal of my life is fake (I don't feel that it is).  I'd
personally be rather hurt if you turned away from me if I wanted the to
thank you for partying with me by giving you a hug.  Also, I look kinda
fucked up and sweaty at a party just from the thrill of dancing hearing a dj 
blow up the spot.

Sorry for sounding so damn sappy.  I've spent too long in the NW scene
(home of the eternal candy raver!!!).

pEace,
jP

     so...

     i went to a barbecue and ended up not
     eating anything of nutritional value. what
     else is new?

     well, some crazy antics up at pooh's house,
     a little too much energy and plenty of 
     new faces.

     shouts to: the PBS massiv [john, geoff, tom]
     todd, frankie G, don + his girlie, mr.rab,
     jbrick [you mac addict, you], trouty and jade
     [move to pittsburgh, 'mkay?], seth the crazy
     baum [with the funky R-rated rekkid collection]
     and of course, andy the pooh. anybody else,
     well, i wasn't being intentionally antisocial,
     really.

     :]

     we gotta do this again, yo.

     geeky

I'm keeping a graphical list of the shows that I know of on my page
http://2209816591/.  It's also got mp3's and all the South Park episodes
that have aired, some that haven't, to this point.  Just click on the Raves

I thought the very first right in the constitution of the United 
States...is the freedom to say whatever the FUCK you want...Everyone is 
just voicing there opinions...no need for the harsh critizism for people 
how do or not do drugs...

not that isnt neccessary to comment like that....maybe you shouldn't go 
to raves without an open mind....just a THOUGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


andythejew

P.S.   this may sound extremely artificial, but from reading all these 
posts and thinking about it...i have decided to stop doing all kinds of 
drugs in any manner....

hey as long as no one gets out of hand and starts causing trouble i have no
problem with it. i believe most people have the right to do what they want to
themselves, they made a choice and that's up to them. as long as they don't
interfere with my enjoyment i don't care. if they do interfere with my
enjoyment i'll just leave. my humble opinion.

trust me... I'm hosting that site, that's the long IP address for it,
"http://2209816591/".  I'm just using this cause I don't like the other
one.  That's the URL, either that or you can use the IP address
"http://131.183.32.15"... there's always "http://www.hyperreal.org", just
thought I'd put it all on one page (I'm bored as fuck ok, don't wanna do my

There can definitely be a conflict when you're interested in the scene mostly
for music and leastly for the drugs.  It's easy to become judgemental (ever hang
out with a bunch of drunk people when you're stone sober?---not much fun).  I
think the point perhaps should be that some things should be kept private and I
happen to believe that drug use is one of them.  I'd hate for someone new to the
list to be introduced to the scene via these kinds of posts.

such a nice piece of yard on the side of andys house, otherwise we would 
have played some footy.
anyway my main complaint is that there wasnt enough jungle;)
shouts to that fat jewish kid that went with us, since no one else likes 
him.
also, shouts to the punk-rawk massive, me, the fat jewish kid, geoff, 
john, and pat (damofo). peace

This message is nothing but a chain letter. DO NOT send it to
anyone, it is nothing but junk mail that eats massive amounts
of bandwidth. There is currently no way to track who this letter
has been sent to, it is nothing but a scam.

i realized it was me they were talking about, it doesn't bother me,  actually
it gave me a good laugh.  In 8 years they will be the old man at the party.
Last week at liquid, I had a girl call me "poop deck pappy" (popeye's dad),
after she got to know me, she thought i was cool and "evil"( she said i waz so
bad i had to be evil) I just have fun with it.

Just wanted to give a shout out to all kids in attendance + our cooly-cool
host andy...definitely a phat setup you have out there in the suburban
wasteland.  Sorry I couldn't stay longer...feels like we were there just a
minute.  More hausparties are cool by me.

On another note:  
I'm looking for this record, its pretty important, and price is only a
minor issue:  The "W" Record, by Bert of Sesame Street.   Somehow I lost
the copy a borrowed from a friend and I really want to replace it.  Any
kind soul have this or know wher to pick it up?

I have no idea what you people are talking about!  When you are rolling,
there is nothing fake about your expression of love.  I don't think I
could do anything but be honest with my emotions at that level of
awareness.  It's possible that the people who *want* to be rolling are
trying to emulate this blissful state, and maybe that's what you're
talking about.  But e is definitely a love turnon in the most earnest and
genuine way I've ever experienced.  And those ravers who are on it are not
lying about anything they feel.

My bet is the people who are talking about the fakeness are the ones who
can't relate.  They don't know how to recipricate perhaps to unexpected
expressions of emotion by relative strangers.  Sound familiar?

The only fake hugs I know of are at family gatherings and in the parking
lots of Phish shows!  :)

*********** Is anyone else getting excited about this? *****************

...I am not so sure why I am this excited. 
...Maybe because the only time I have seen them, I thought they were
incredible (two Aprils ago, at Ultraworld's Ritual in D.C.). 
...Maybe its the fact that I havent been to anything since Phorm (I am
choosing my entertainment very carefully these days). I have decided in the
past year to start treating parties as if they were concerts, and you wouldnt
go to a concert every weekend, would you? (well, some of you would) ;-) 

A side note about this event... the promoter is named Ed Johnson... has anyone
ever heard of him? Rob Sherwood alluded to the shadiness of this guy, but
wouldnt expand much on why.  I guess all I am concerned with is RITM showing
up and performing. Talk to you all later!  -Casey-

OK, I never thought I would be
one of those idiots who post
while intoxicated.  I'm sorry for that
and bringing up this topic.
Please let this be the last post about it.

Since I did bring it up, I had better clarify
that it can be dangerous.  As with all drugs
(and yes, DXM is as much a drug as LSD or MDMA),
do your research first and keep it safe- DON'T OD!
The correct brand is:
Tussin MAXIMUM Strength COUGH.

Not Cough and COLD.
JUST COUGH.
Everything else has extra ingredients that are bad.

And all of you snippy anti-drug people, 
don't think less of people who use, 
just those who ABUSE.

I will continue my safe use of drugs
until I find a reason to stop.
I think that using them helps
anchor me to reality even more.
(Plus it is fun)
I know people who never did anything,
not even alcohol, EVER!, and they are
pretty scary!

Sorry about that posting of that junk earlier... didn't notice it was from
someone on AOL.  I realized what I did just after I hit send, too late
after that.  I feel so damm stoopid after that.

so does anyone know anything about this? did it actually pass and if so,
is it actually enforced?
---------- Forwarded message begins here ----------


The Allegheny Board of Licenses recently passed a resolution creating a
special ordinance requiring a special party permit for all gatherings in
any structure within any residential or commercial zone.  If the
gathering is more than 40 persons a permit must be applied for and
purchased.  The base permit costs $15 for application fee and $27.50 for
a permit for a party of up to 40 people.  For 40 more persons the permit
goes up to $38.50.  This means a permit for a party of no more than 80
persons will cost $81.00!  

Fines for those not having the proper permits will be fined $150 for the
first forty people and an additional $60 for each aditional group of
forty.  Partying is about to get expensive.

	Listen, there are opinions, and crticism for everything anyone does!  We need
to respect what eachothers opinions are.  Drugs or no drugs, the vibe is a
contributing factor to a good rave too!  Its all about respecting.  This has
to be the most retorical thing I have writen all day....

I remember when this was posted before.  I never took the time to confirm
it...but you can look at all the city ordinances on-line....do a netsearch
on pittsburgh.  

I've been to only one house party that might have had 40 people at once,
but it wasn't busted.  I think this things just too hard to enforce unless
there are other reasons to bust the party in the first place.  I wouldn't
let it stop me in the least.

I hope we all feel better now. Reading those opinions sent me on a 
roller coaster ride. I don't know about you guys, but I can feel the 
emotion when I read your posts and I don't like it when you cut each 
other down -- it makes me feel bad.......I dunno.....I guess I'm really 
sensitive. I like you guys and I don't like to see you fight!!!

youre definitely wrong. pittsburgh has one of my favorite bands of any 
style (who also happen to be a punk band) in aus rotten...if you havent 
seen them, they have their discography cd out for only $6 (35 songs, 
each one totally fuckin great) and they still play live often....there 
are also a million other bands i could use as exapmles, but i dont feel 
like wasting bandwith. punk is still good, just perhaps not as relevant.

>Also Original Opp. Ivy is good too.  All this new age shit SUCKS!!!!

<<...I am not so sure why I am this excited.

incredible (two Aprils ago, at Ultraworld's Ritual in D.C.). 
...Maybe its the fact that I havent been to anything since Phorm (I am
choosing my entertainment very carefully these days). I have decided in the
past year to start treating parties as if they were concerts, and you wouldnt
go to a concert every weekend, would you? (well, some of you would) ;-) 

A side note about this event... the promoter is named Ed Johnson... has anyone
ever heard of him? Rob Sherwood alluded to the shadiness of this guy, but
wouldnt expand much on why.  I guess all I am concerned with is RITM showing
up and performing. Talk to you all later!  -Casey->>

tee hee, big surprise, da porn cru will be makin a trip up for RITM...

welp, in the 6 years i've been in the ohio rave scene, i've never heard of
this guy, but then again, i try to stay away from the shade...

however, if anyone has contact info, please e-mail me privately, i'd
like to give him the benefit of the doubt...

tee hee, DM's "People are People" that came out on a 45rpm record
was one of the first pieces of vinyl i had ever purchased

actually, come to think of it i don't think i've ever missed a DM show,
would be different to see 'em @ Gund as opposed to Blossom

welp, i think most of the time the stuff that happens on e is pretty fake... i
mean, someone you hardly know can be all over you and tell you things like
they love you, when they obviously cant be.. they just want to be touched,
because it feels so nice on e.. if yer with someone who you really love or
have feelings for, im sure they might be enhanced or things you didnt realize
might surface.. something like that maybe.. but for the most part i think its
just a bunch of kids that want to be touched because it feels good.. and if
yer around someone you think it cute then you might think you feel more for
them than you really do, because you want to feel something for someone.. im
prolly not making any sense... im just saying that i dont think most of the
feelings generated by people on e are true feelings..

heres what happened to me.
before i ever did drugs, the things i thought about were totally out 
there, and my way of thought was much more interesting. when on drugs of 
any type, i felt like my thoughts were much like those of other drug 
users....its a type of unintentional conformity......and its something 
that i didnt like, and im pretty sure that that conformity is one of the 
few common grounds of EVERY drug....in my opinion, it makes people less 
interesting. oh well.

---------------( begin clip from LOTUS magazine )--------------

Everyone has their own opinion as to what Electronic Dance culture 
is all about.  Some say it comes down to the music.  Some say it's 
all about dancing.  Some say it's about gathering together for a
spiritual purpose.  For others it's about getting high.  For some 
it's about changing the world.  For some it's about escaping the 
drudgery of life for awhile.
	In the end whatever people feel it's supposed to be about is in
 some way based upon their experience.  How a person interprets 
that experience end up creating their reality, their value system.  
Once that happens then people in their own way begin to work to 
convert their own understanding of their experience into a reality 
that other people will experience.
	If people believe that it's all about the music, they support 
the music. They support those events that claim to be all about 
the music. In their agreement, people begin to see the importance 
of the music.
	If people believe it's all about getting high, they support that
belief with their behavior.  They set a model for other people with 
the way they act and the decisions they make.  So, others begin to 
see the impact of drugs in people's lives and people begin to think 
that it's all about drugs.	If people believe that it's all about
spirituality, they support those who work within a spiritual ethic.  
They attend events with a spiritual
vibe.  They organise events around spiritual themes.  They produce 
music with spiritual titles.  People who experience the music and 
dancing in this context pick up on it and Dance culture becomes 
more about spirituality as a result.
	Ultimately, Electronic Dance culture is what you make it.  It's 
not just about the drugs or spirituality or fashion or dancing or 
even music. It's just what it is.   Dance culture is not any one 
thing.  When people begin to decide what Dance culture is all about, 
they limit it and they consequentially limit other people's ability 
to make up their own mind as to what all of this is about FOR THEM.  
So keep an open mind.
	Sure, everyone has different things which appeal them, whether 
it be music, Dance, spirituality, or socializing, and there's 
nothing wrong with supporting that aspect which moves you most.
However, when we start supporting any one position as the only 
correct way of looking at Dance culture then we've become as close-
minded as the rest of society.
	Think for yourself, but don't assume what's right for you is
necessarily right for everyone else.  It may be.  It may not be.  
That is a question that each of us has the inherent human duty to 
respect and protect the rights of other people to decide for 
themselves. Freedom, mutual respect, and personal responsibility 
- the three are completely interdependent upon one another.  
Achieving it begins with thinking for yourself.	Some people are 
big on claiming to think for themselves.  They like to protect 
themselves as individuals on the edge, but when you really get 
to know them you begin to notice that they just repeatedly choose
whatever route is opposite, the route everyone around them has 
chosen.  It becomes clear that they're as much as a slave to what
everyone else thinks as someone who just blindly follows the crowd.
Thinking for yourself doesn't mean thinking differently from other
people just to be different.
	   It doesn't mean thinking the opposite of everyone else just 
       to be an individual.
      It doesn't mean always agreeing with people whom you share
       some identity with.
      It doesn't mean never listening to other people.
      It doesn't mean never trusting what other people have to 
       say.

      It means taking responsibility for your own decisions.
      It means honestly accepting that your words, actions, and 
       thoughts are ultimately your own.
      It means blaming other people for your own decisions is in
        fact giving them power of making your decisions for you.

It's not easy to just get up and start taking complete 
responisbility for your own thoughts.  We haven't met a person yet 
who's completely been able to do it.  We're not programmed be 
society to think for ourselves.  We're programmed by the media and
societal structures to be quiet little drones who watch TV, buy 
the right products, and perform our essential duties to ensure that
we can feed and clothe ourselves.  Sometimes society is right.  
Sometimes society is wrong, the injustices and inequalities in life 
are clear signs of that. Educate yourself!  Decide for yourself!  
But do so with an open mind.
	All this is brought up because at times Dance culture is
 dangerously close to becoming a caricature of itself.  People 
some times seem to spend more time doing what they're told than
experiencing things for all they're worth.  Don't let the media
(including the Dance media) determine what this culture is all 
about.  Let it become what it naturally is instead of what it 
is defined to be.
	In the end we all have to decide what our future will be, 
that decision is made in the present.  You ultimately have to 
make that decision yourself.

	How will you answer it?

Your answer effects everyone and by avoiding the question you 
are clearly stating your choice.

	How will you answer it?

Only you can truly know what this all means to you.

	What does it mean to you?

ALRIGHT!!!  

I've been listening to the new DM tribute album for about a week now.  Depeche
Mode was the reason that I got into electronic music (back in 1990:-)   If
anyone has a chance to see them live...I highly recommend it...it's alot like
U2's "Zoo TV" tour but with better effects:-) !!!

An interesting tidbit...
Extraordinarily reliable resources tell me...
It's not RITM performing this weekend.  It's Confuscious (David Christopher)
spinning.  It's not going to be a "RITM" show as it would bring to mind (Bunny
prancing around a la mid evil knight, a la lion/robot character person).  I'm not
saying that it won't be loads of fun. Not really saying anything except that it's
supposedly not RITM.  It's David C and Sleepy C too.
And I have no idea who Ed Johnson is (besides the former coach of the Penguins).

i don't know if i can agree... i think the emotions/sensations are more

gotten plenty of them from ppl who weren't rollin.  i don't give hugs 
ALL the time cuz maybe i'm a little shy... but maybe that biz about 
smiles being contagious is true.  just lookin around and seein ppl 
dancin, seein the DJ havin a blast (maybe one of his funnest sets 
ever!), seein smiles on kids faces, it makes you(me) feel good as hell, 
rollin or not.  as far as love goes... guess that depends on what you 
think love is.  isn't it a chemical released in the brain after certain 
physical/mental stimuli? %^)  and even feelin good when ppl are touched 
happens w/ or w/o rolls.  givin your grandma a hug or giving your S.O. a 
neck rub can make you feel good too, just not as intense.  blah blah 
blah... just testifyin'

  well, my opinion on the meaningful-e-stuff is .......
   I like the love that I give and receive when I am rollin and when I 
give somebody a hug I usually meen it more than ever and I feel that 
when you roll it's everyones true lovin nature coming out in them.

okay, everyone's asked me, now i try to explain.

the 323 is the 'marker mod' 303. It's basically purple lettering instead
of white, with some minor mods. if you know what the 626 is, the 323 is
basically the 626 of 303's.

or something like that.

CONTINUUM
Friday, November 27th, 1998 - Cleveland, Ohio
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 For our one year anniversary event, Shortarm has decided to go all out and
organize an event that truly represents our musical tastes, and the style of
our events.
We have secured, once again; Adam Beyer (Drumcode, Sweden), Joel Mull (Inside,
Sweden), and Christian Smith (Tronic, Sweden). In the past year, Sweden has
become to techno what Detroit had been at the start. Virtually every producer
in Sweden now is pumping out quality, groundbreaking music, consistently.
Adam, Joel, and Christian (along with Cari Lekebusch, Jasper Dahlback, and
Alexi Delano) are currently the most in-demand techno dj's and producers in
the world. For those (few) of you that managed to climb out of bed from the
July 4th weekend to come to Phunktion on the 10th/11th, you know what to
expect from these 3. For the rest of you, you are definitely in for a treat.
In addition to the return of the Swedes, we are also proud to welcome Claude
Young (Frictional/7th City - Detroit/London) to Cleveland for the first time
in a LONG time. Claude was one of the original pioneers of the Detroit techno
sound. Claude is known worldwide for his intense dj sets and live
performances.
Lastly, we are also pleased to present James Ruskin (Blueprint - London) to
Ohio for the first time ever. James is one of the top producers in the new
movement of techno. His label Blueprint is one of the fastest rising labels in
the world. He also has very notable releases on Surface records. 
We originally intended on having the Surgeon (aka Tony Childs), however, he
had to back out of the small U.S. tour with Claude Young due to personal
reasons. We believe that James Ruskin will be more than a suitable
replacement. Surgeon will, however, be at our first major event in 1999, which
will almost definitely be on February 13th, 1999. 
check out our website at //members.aol.com/Shortarm5/continue.htm

hey all...

I saw one of rosebud's ads in a weekly and it had the mad prof slated
for 10/27.  I pulled up pollstar but couldn't find anything about the
show or even a tour.  does anyone have details?  prices, ages, openers?
	I recall seeing something for one of his shows in philly awhile back w/
lee "scratch" perry opening.  If those two came I can't tell you how
excited I'd be...

thanx,
jesse

Just one thing. What is a 'fake' emotion? I mean, if you
are feeling it, regardless of the chemical state that you
are in, it is an emotion. Just a thought.

If so, are they any good?  A friend of mine in DC said to look em up, so I

Hey.
As a Frankie Bones lover (his music),
I purchased United DJs of America.
I am just now getting used to it, as it 
is unlike his music that I am familiar with.
It is more hard trance/hard techno, trip hoppyish.
I'm used to his hard house slaying stuff
(Like Computer Controlled, which rules. BUY IT!!!)

If anyone has any suggestions of good
Bonesavelt material, let me know.

		Thanks, Dave

Yea, I've heard of it, it actually is promoting goodness from dj's,
unlike what the title suggests.  They explore the in's and out's of
Jungle and Drum&Bass dj's and producers...There are some other films out
that are about the techno/rave scene, one being "Modulations" and from
what I hear this one is pretty decent...This film was featured this past
year at the Cleveland International Film Festival in March.
peace.

 Friday, November 27th, 1998 - Cleveland, Ohio
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
 --
  For our one year anniversary event, Shortarm has decided to go all out and
 organize an event that truly represents our musical tastes, and the style of
 our events.
 We have secured, once again; Adam Beyer (Drumcode, Sweden), Joel Mull
(Inside,
 Sweden), and Christian Smith (Tronic, Sweden). In the past year, Sweden has
 become to techno what Detroit had been at the start. Virtually every producer
 in Sweden now is pumping out quality, groundbreaking music, consistently.
 Adam, Joel, and Christian (along with Cari Lekebusch, Jasper Dahlback, and
 Alexi Delano) are currently the most in-demand techno dj's and producers in
 the world. For those (few) of you that managed to climb out of bed from the
 July 4th weekend to come to Phunktion on the 10th/11th, you know what to
 expect from these 3. For the rest of you, you are definitely in for a treat.
 In addition to the return of the Swedes, we are also proud to welcome Claude
 Young (Frictional/7th City - Detroit/London) to Cleveland for the first time
 in a LONG time. Claude was one of the original pioneers of the Detroit techno
 sound. Claude is known worldwide for his intense dj sets and live
 performances.
 Lastly, we are also pleased to present James Ruskin (Blueprint - London) to
 Ohio for the first time ever. James is one of the top producers in the new
 movement of techno. His label Blueprint is one of the fastest rising labels
in
 the world. He also has very notable releases on Surface records. 
 We originally intended on having the Surgeon (aka Tony Childs), however, he
 had to back out of the small U.S. tour with Claude Young due to personal
 reasons. We believe that James Ruskin will be more than a suitable
 replacement. Surgeon will, however, be at our first major event in 1999,
which
 will almost definitely be on February 13th, 1999.

I just picked up a mix by Swedish Egil on the Positiv label, it has the
big POSITIV plus sign on the cover, and let me tell you...this dude and
this label, has some of the phattest shit i've ever heard. If you like
swedish techno, or just techno for that matter, get this disc, it
f**ckin' rocks!
peace.

maybe fake *emotion* isnt the right way of putting it.. maybe its more of a
fake act  or something.. i dunno. i know plenty of people can be genuine on e
and really mean it when they hug you or smile at you or whatever, what im
talking about is the kind of person who feels all lovey, or whatever, and
wants to makeout with someone or get their hump on simply because they know it
will feel really good while rollin'... they dont really feel anything for the
person theyre with, other than the desire to hit it and quit it. 
thats it.

To all ya's that went to Crystal Method in PA, how long was Lunatic Calms set?
Also, because I am new to this list, I would totaly hate to ask this question,
and also because not a single person here knows who the hell I am, it makes it
even harder.....but, I am interested in going to RITM, but might not have a
ride.  :(  Would anybody from clevo want to hook a stranger up?

I really hope you are joking about that entire post.  The 505 is not that
great and defanitly not worth 1200 or whatever amount was paid.  Mine was
givin to me by a friend.  The sounds are horrible, but it is handy for an ok
sequencer for other gear.  It is a good learning tool, but defanitly not the
best roland machine by far!!!

hope you were kidding,
Jason

if you have to ingest something to feel the emotion, it is fake. if it 
happens naturally, it is not.....i know there are lots of chemicals that 
can affect us in the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we 
drink, but these are not ingested on purpose......its like going to a 
store, throwing down your $20-30 and saying "one dose of happiness, 
please."
i dont think theres necessarily anything wrong with that, but i dont 
appreciate it.

this looks like its going to be more than just a phat party.  
the people behind this even are not just your average rave kids.  they
have passion and energy and most importantly beliefs and ethics that
could do a great service to society, if their voices could be heard. 
support this party and you'll be supporting what really could be great
about the rave scene.  : )  and you might just hear a great dj or three
in the process.  ; )

Dig a really deep pit in a public park, and cover it over with sticks 
and leaves. Come back the next day and see how many joggers you've 
captured. Keep them alive in there until they swear allegiance to you.
Now you have an UNHOLY ARMY OF JOGGERS!

On January 30,1998 we launched ravedata... Since then, we've taken the
site beyond even our expectations... Stop by and check out the new look
and features!

                  connect .. search .. discover .. transcend


		           http://www.ravedata.com/


RAVEDATA: The definitive source for rave information.

We've sifted through more than 1.5 MILLION email messages, traversed
hundreds of websites, collected over 2,000 flyers full of infomation and
entered it into our database to produce the largest, most comprehensive and
factual rave-related site on the internet.

Here is only some of what the site has to offer at the moment:

	LOOKING FOR A PARTY? Search through an ever-growing collection of
	events (presently over 5,600) for past, present or future parties 
	anywhere in the world!

	SEEKING MIXTAPES? Search among 2400 mixtapes for that mixtape you
	lost long ago, or just heard for the first time the other day and
	want to find someone who has a copy, or maybe even contact the DJ 
        that _mixed_ it to get a copy straight from the source!  Trade	
	with us, add yourself to our "list of traders" or check out our
	webboard that's dedicated solely to mixtapes!

	DO YOU COLLECT RAVE FLYERS? We have over 5,000 extras to trade, with 
	more coming in every day! We are in the process of scanning and
	linking every flyer we can get our hands on to the event itself as
	well as information about the artist/graphics co. that designed
	it!

	ARE YOU A DJ LOOKING TO GET YOUR NAME OUT? We do mixtape reviews,
	help promote (via trading your tape among others), and provide
	you with powerful searches to find promoters and booking agents 
	virtually anywhere!

	WONDERING WHO A CERTAIN DJ IS/WAS? Scan our catalog of over 10,000
	DJs worldwide!  Search by city, country, performance, partial
	name, alias or partial mixtape title!

	LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE? We also keep track of Sound, Lighting, 
	Laser, and Visual professionals, as well as mixtape reviews,
	essays and much more...



INTRIGUED YET?  Want to be a part of something this BIG?  We can always
use _YOUR_ help, too... What are you waiting for? Get involved!

	SUBMIT INFO! Comb our site.. Submit any additions or corrections
	to info@ravedata.com.  We're constantly striving to make our info
	as complete and as correct as possible... So feel free to send us
	anything that we may be missing.

	SEND US FEEDBACK Many suggestions and criticisms have shaped the
	project into what it is today... Without your feedback, we can't 
	possibly know how we're doing. Drop us a line via the "Feedback"
	option from the menu.

	LINK TO US If you have a "list of links" page, please include our
	site!  If you'd like, write to raveinfo and request a button or
	logo graphic... We'll gladly send them to you...
	
	SEND US NEWS We're trying our best to maintain the most up-to-date
	rave-related news stories, but again... We're only a small team of 
	individuals... Please, send us any mention of our scene (good or
	bad) that is news worthy... send email to news@ravedata.com

	DONATE/TRADE FLYERS If you have any extra flyers or back 
	issues of rave-related magazines, send them to a good home...
	or trade us flyers-for-flyers! send email to flyers@ravedata.com

	HELP VERIFY INFO LINES A little more than two years ago, we 
	printed and gave out our "Fonebook".  A nationwide listing of 
	promoters, stores and clubs.  Many DJs, promoters and ravers alike
	found it to be incredibly useful whenever traveling or moving 	
	to a new city/state...We hope to print our third edition soon.  To
	do so, we need the help of individuals willing to call a list of
	LOCAL phone numbers that we send via email to you, you indicate
	which ones have changed or have been disconnected.. and send the
	email back!  We'll repay you with a mixtape of your choice (from
	our list) 

	FILL IN THE BLANKS! Select "Fill in the _______!" from our menu,
	and explore specific tidbits of information we're seeking!  Click
	on any item you happen to know, type the city/date/etc, then click
	"Submit!" ... It's that easy!

	SEND US PICS! Soon, we'll have the ability to attach party
	pictures to events just as easily as line-ups, etc... We need people
 	to submit their party pics and give us permission to use them
	(they will be fully credited of course). 

	TRADE MIXTAPES WITH US! We just want to grow our collection, so we
	trade (not sell) mixtapes.  Check out our collection and email
	your list and "wants" from ours to tapes@ravedata.com.  We're always 
	looking for something new and groovin' to listen to!


	We hope to see you very soon!

maybe the word you are looking for is 'insincere'?

i know a lot of ppl who say things they dont mean or wouldnt normally do 
while under the influence.  the brilliance of ecstasy definitely wears 
off with time.

This is a lot like the last days of my partying.

*sniffle* But I'm... FUCK IT.

Okay, who the fuck is going, and who can loan me a tent or something to
tow a pop-up trailer with? I'm going, broke or not, goddamnit.

For those of you who missed it cutup played a phat ass set of Gabber with a
couple jungle tunes and I thought it was some elctro slower stuff in there.
Many thanks to dj -brian who still plays about every other Friday at Club
Laga for putting this on! I had a HARDCORE blast!

Sorry that tom and the others who didn't quite make the age requirement
couldn't stay, but massive props for trying!

And I hope the woman who fainted/had a seizure at the 2nd room bar is ok.
I was dancing and missed what happened.  Hope she is ok.  Perhaps there
should be warning signs posted at Gabber/Hardcore sets in the future? My
feeling is that if you are going to a rave/club you should know to expect
more than a little thump, thump.  Any ideas?

     re: all the random verbiage being bandied
     about on the subject of chemicals and their
     uses or abuses...my take.

     drugs have changed my life, my personality,
     and my perception.

     this is not a bad thing.

     having grown up with repression, intolerance,
     rules, regulations, and absolute religious
     adherence, i have a number of painful issues
     that i have to deal with on a regular basis.

     growing up in an environment like that, being
     molded into conformity with a set of beliefs
     and practices as foreign to my true nature 
     as can possibly be, has resulted in bouts of
     depression, destructive rage, and reclusive
     anti-social tendencies. if you think your 
     parents are strict, if you think you aren't 
     ever allowed to do anything, then you haven't
     seen shit.

     i wasn't allowed to listen to the radio until
     i left home, never even watched TV or movies. 
     couldn't own my own clothes, couldn't own
     anything, in fact. never allowed to fraternize
     outside those of 'my' religion.

     no wonder i act crazy.

     for those of you who preach moderation, who
     babble about drugs being dangerous, talk 
     about fake hugs, fake smiles - get a life.

     preferably, get a life like mine.

     then you'll understand that suicidal depression
     is a lot more dangerous than a line of e, that
     the pain of overcoming years of programming,
     nervous breakdowns, ulcers - these aren't a hell
     of a lot of fun.

     maybe you haven't figured out that some people
     _are_ fake. maybe it takes a little while to 
     realize that there is no cure-all, no truth 
     serum, no panacea, no perfect pill that will
     make us all wonderful people.

     truth is, a lot of people have a lot of problems,
     the majority of us are rather selfish, stupid,
     and self-centered. drugs alone can never solve
     these problems.

     but for those of us fighting against a plastic
     shell, for those of us who were never allowed
     to be wild and free, drugs can be the most 
     wonderful thing in the world.

     if you're stupid, drugs won't make you smart.
     if you're evil, drugs won't make you good. if
     you're sad, drugs probably won't make you
     happy, not for very long.

     but they can break down the barriers in your
     mind and allow you to be who you really are.

     so there.

     :P

     have a fake hug, everyone.
     <hug>

i don't know about all of this.  regardless of your background,
you're now at school away from your family and are free to
be and act any way you choose.  that reason alone, being
outside of the bubble which conformed you, should be the
most refreshing 'high' you have ever achieved.

personally, i wouldn't say drugs are making or have 'made me who 
i am' today.  just as i wouldn't allow religious dogma or parental 
strictness mold me, i refuse a substance to be the dictator of
my happiness or freedom.  

you've already stepped back and reflected upon the marked changes that 
your life has taken, and it's wonderful that you're able to finally make 
decisions on your own.  i just wouldn't put so much faith into a drug.  
have more love in yourself and who you can become.

but I CAN promise a great vibe. Plus, I'm making a giant plastic bubble

amen, alot of ppl are ranting about these, but have not used _anything_
else.  its sort of instant gratification coz you can make tunes right out
of the box and thats about it.  they're really limited in the synthesis
dept and not expandable in _any_ way.   i say get a sequencer that works
for ya and some real synths.

>if you have to ingest something to feel the emotion, it is fake.

What about prozac? The people who take it or other antidepressants
are just naturally depressed. By your reasoning, all of their good
feelings are fake because that is not their natural state. Actually,
prozac and ecstasy both work in a very similar manner. One is just
all at once instead of spread out over a long time.

But many people do just that, except they are prescribed their happy
pills instead of buying them illegally. Do you feel that it is okay 
for people to take a drug to feel more happy to get to what the
rest of us call normal, but not okay to take a drug to get more
happy than what most consider normal? I'm not trying to criticize
you at all with this, I'm just wondering what you think.

Olive is very poppish. I bought their album, and I would consider
most of it to be watered down trip hop. One or two songs are catchy
enough to get stuck in your head, but otherwise far too commercial.

That's how I feel.  The mc303 and mc505 are like toys.  Any monkey could
lay down something that sounds nice in about five minutes.  I would
discourage anyone wanting to produce CREATIVE music from buying one.
They sound alright but you can download most of their sounds from
hyperreal, I believe.

I got this from one of my other lists.  The British guy's comments start
first and the quoted American's comments have an ">" before them:

Here, I would argue the main function of a party is the gathering of ppl
with he premeditated intention of having a good time. I think this must have
come over in the reviews I've posted about parties I've been to - I usually
describe the event, the location, the ppl there, maybe even the DJ if
there's a good one or one who does something strange, but I very rarely if
ever mention the actual music.

>I get the

>is here.

It's not just the drugs, don't get hung up on this one. But yes, I think you
are right, its generally accepted here that if you have a "rave", there will
be drugs. Indeed just the other week the police tried to close a club in
Milton Keyens because there was a lot of drugs used there. However the local
council threw out the police objections because the club was doing as much
as it could to provide a safe environment. The councillors argued that ppl
will take drugs in "raves", so its better it happens in a controlled place.

>Ever since we were kids, everyone tried to beat it into our
>heads that drugs are bad, drugs make you into worthless bums who steal,
>yada yada yada, and I think there may be an subconcious "embarrassment"
>in admitting that one is a recreational user.

It does seem to be the case. Why is it that US ppl are so influenced by the
state? You have a much more open media than we do (at least in theory) and
all sorts of rights about freedom of information etc, yet you still
collectively fall for the lies and misinformation put about by your govt.
Its almost as if the need to conform to some sort of "norm" is seen as far
more important in the US than here.

Anyway, they tried it here, but it didn't work. Back around the late 80's
talking about drugs was a no-no, but as the issue came up the social agenda,
it came into the open.

There is no "embarrasment" connected with recreational drug use now in the
UK for sure.

>Being a raver in the US
>must be something totally different than being a raver from outside the
>US.

I'm glad you put it that way, because I've partied all around the world and
nowhere else seems to have this taboo against drugs (yeah they are illegal
but so what?). It is the US which is strange in this respect I think.

Having said all this though, I do love trance and dark techno. Trance I
listen to all the time if I can, but its really around 3am that the vibe
really comes together. Yes, the music sets the feel to a party, but its on
the dark hot dancefloor in the early hours that it comes into its own, but
how much of this is the event, the ppl, the venue and - yes - the communal
effect of MDMA. The next chance you get, look around at those dinner plate
eyes, the sweaty bodies, thats the vibe, that's what parties are really about.

Or do you spend all the time watching the DJ and listening to the mixing?
Sad if you do, you're missing the best bit.

Arrrghhh - time for work

All in all this is a pretty interesting argument, although it hasn't been
spelled out all that clearly.  I'm not sure i have any answers,
but i do have some general thoughts.

True.  On some scientific level, everything is chemistry (+ physics).  But
that might be too simple of a level to take things on.   People are
equally influenced by their own experiences/thoughts as they are their
chemistry. 

You may not see someone on E as acting fakely towards you.  However,
on the same turn:  if someone you know that usually ignores you or is
abrasive to you or just doesn't know you at all is acting all nice to you,
don't you think something of it?  Perhaps you'd even think they are acting
fakely.  Perhaps you're very accepting and its a good thing, but to alot
of people this would come off as insincere (as hossam put it).  In the end
i won't judge anyone by how they act on drugs, or how they act in any one
instance (everyone has a bad day), but on the whole.  Oh, how idealistic
geoff.  PS: i usually take hugs from anyone, unless your one of them shady
crackhead PBS fags. :P  :)

That prozac arguement is interesting.  I think the difference between
prozac and 'entertainment' drugs - and this i might see as pretty obvious,
but maybe not to others - is one is helping get rid of a bad feeling,
while the other is enhancing an already normal or good feeling.  Yeah, the
truth is alot of people use entertainment drugs to get rid of bad
feelings, and i don't know what to say about that.  Nothing wrong with
that per se, but it feels like a sad situation to me.  All in all its your
idea of happyness.  Is it merely a feeling - just something that can be
stimulated inside you, a process - something that happens over time, not
instant, an indicator - just telling you something about what the hell
you're doing with your life? 

Am i getting too analytical?  

Yep.  But I wrote this much, so here, you go, read it. :)

I would have to agree more with the Brit's opinion. Sure, if the
music sucks, the party is more likely  to suck, but if you aren't
going to a party to have a good time, what is the point? You can't
just go and find the same kind of vibe you get at a good party
anywhere else. I'm sure most of us have been to parties where the
music was great, but for whatever reason, the party sucked anyway.
Look at the reviews for Easy on the DC mailing list. The music
apparently kicked all ass, but the security were such assholes that
many people had a bad time. Then sometimes you can go to a party
where the music is only so-so, and have an awesome time because the
vibe is so thick and everyone is happy. It's not ALL about the music.
If it were, raves would just be like any other concert type event.
Look at, say, the Grateful Dead. Their concerts weren't all about
the music, there was a whole culture that went along with it. Raves
are the same sort of thing.

this is a point that i would like to say somthing about anyway...after 
taking about 2 weeks worth of zoloft at once, i decided that 
antidepressants make people into zombies.....i guess its a weaker 
version, but i still dont like it....i know it may seem odd, but i hate 
e and antidepressants for the reason that they both make you feel 
emotions that woldnt regularly be felt.....the legality is 
irrelevant....i hold very little reguard for what is legal and what 
isnt, so they are basically the same to me in principle....ever read 
kurt vonnegut's short story "the euphio question"?

Heya kids, me again - 

Just wanted to thank my hero Jeff Brick for comin' out to the Pollinator
and bouncin' around to the rotterdam sounds.  You really are my hero.
Props to the PBS massive for trying to be all wiley and avoid the man, but
that bitch was observant.  That's why i tend not to support the 21+ stuff.
Double thanks to Brian for playing some really good tunes and having me
up. :)

Shame on the softie raver massive - there were about 20:1 industrial:raver
kids there last night.  Ah its ok, i loves ya anyway, and i don't expect
much of a draw on tuesday, unpromoted. 

All in all it was a fun time dropping all of these tunes on a fairly
decent system....yeah even the Smiley Slayers and Memetic...they told me
that record would kill, but I didn't know how literal they were.

On a serious note, I hope the girl who fainted/collapsed is ok.
That was kinda skarry.

till next time -  doc cutup

This whole discussion is wonderful.  I wuz beginning to think youz kids just
did stuff without thinking about it.  But after hearing all the pros and cons,
i can see we have a lot of philosophers on the list.  I am not being
sarcastic, but too many people do things( drugs, abuse, or anything negative)
without thinking about the consequences of their actions.  Thumbs up to
everyone that had some input on the subject. 
Me? I only have one philosophy, do what you want to do and stay happy while
doing it. PEACE {;-) mark

yay tom. i agree. my friend is on prozac or something, and he likes it cuz it
doesnt make him feel all depressed all the time like he was before, but at the
same time, it masks anything else he may be feeling and keeps him at one
mindset all the time.. thats sorta sad... not to mention.. fake.. i hate the
idea of not being able to feel real emotions, good or bad.

Ed Johnson is a goth/industrial promoter.... he has done tons of
respectable shows here in cleveland, (the last front 242 show, and many
recient goth shows were done by him.)

He likes the energy and vibe of house/techno and wants to get more involved.

As to the show this saturday,  it is just Dj Confuscoius (SP?) , Ed was
actually mislead by RITM's managment, he actually thought he was paying for
a Full live show. But Instead Confucious is just spinning. And let me tell
you for what Ed is paying, he should be getting a live show!!!
Also, it's a record release party for Confuscious so I'm sure they will be
giving all kinds of neat RITM stuff away!

So that's the speil, promoter = nice guy, sat. show = DJ's only.

Peace & respects,
Sleepy

sorry this is off topic but i need help and have no idea where to look or
who else to ask. this account i have could be canceled at any time because
i'm not in college right now, so i need to find a way to get a new one
accessible from my house. the computer has a modem but no connection
service. does anybody know if i can hook up something for free or if i can
buy a program for it, that will let me use pine? (i don't want to pay by
the month) also is there a shareware or freeware c/c++ compiler anywhere?

I don't know. All emotions are just chemicals in your brain, so
I have no problem with augmenting them once in a while. I don't 
consider it fake, but I don't necessarily take anything anyone
says while rolling too seriously. 

Would you consider someone flipping out on acid not really terrified
because the state is chemically induced?

well since everyone is throwing in their two cents on this topic i guess ill
throw in mine. This is my personal belief on the subject (wrong or right). I
think we can all agree that all of our emotions ARE in someway chemically
induced. Experiences and life experiences also play a rold in how we act. E
just makes those chemicals work a little harder making emotions stronger. I
honestly don't believe there are any 'fake' emotions when you're on the drug.
Emotions are just your state of mind at a given time. We all need to be
influenced or affected by something to receive a given emotion. Some people
like to go out and start hacking off peoples limbs to get this rush of 'good'
feeling. Others take drugs. My opinion is most people aren't fake when on E,
they just have more balls to hug or talk to someone. Enviroment also plays a
big part. You can take E and walk through a mall but you won't go around
hugging people because it's not accepted in that particular enviroment. I
honestly believe that enviroment play a big part in our emotions and how you
act. Basically E is just a way to get certain emotions out of your body. The
true question is not whether or not the emotions are fake but is the method by
which you received those emotions acceptable by other people. anywho just my
two cents worth .... sorry it was so long i tend to babble.

I think that is the same reason many people do them . . . because it
isn't the norm and it is something different.  And e and
antidepressents aren't the only things like that . . . that's pretty
much the point of substances in general . . . so does that mean that
you don't like any substance?

Hello everyone,

My name is teak and I just subscribed to pb-cle-raves. I live in
morgantown with my close family and go to school at wvu. My people here
and the very good people that thru Cosmic Nature last year, have come
together to form a larger family. Our tribe is the CosmicTribe.

We'll on sept 25-27 (about 1.5 wks from now) we are having a gathering
on our sisters 250 acre home. We are giving the proceeds to a really
good orginization called the GreenSpace Coalition. Admission is $5, and
if you bring food (about $10 worth/person) you will get a food card, and
be able to eat in the food kitchen (untill the food runs out) you can
also pay $10 and there will be a food run... get the Idea.

so I invite you all to come back to our website and take a look around.
Please contact us if you are down...

peace out

they have some info there.

http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/nyc/archives/
Load up an archive and you can 'find on page' for whatever text string
you may be looking for.
I found it interesting to say the least.

	Yeah, my experience with 303s is that while you can do some neat
stuff with them, for the price they cost, you can get a fairly decent
synth that will do a lot more.  Not to entirely complain about 303s,
they're very useful as just randome rapid bleeping stuff.  But definitely,
it'd be a lot less fun on its own without better instruments to compliment
it.

There was a Frankie Bones record out a few months back that was nothing but
a sample ("Back on the East Coast") filtering in & out over one of the 505
presets (umm, Abstract 3 or something).  Ha!  I guess not everyone's that
concerned with originality.

Ok, so now I know that the 505 sucks.
So what should I start out with?
Could I get an 808 for under $1000?

I'm listening to Metalheadz: Platinum Breakz
right now.  It rules, get it!
Especially if you have a 600 watt stereo like me!

dextromorphan hydrobromide= DXM (the stuff in cough syrup)

crosses the blood brain barrier = pretty self-explanatory

and causes mutagenesis, = genetic change, mutation

oncogenesis, and carcinogenesis = cancer

in somatic cells. = cells that make up tissues, organs, etc

so i think what it says is that DXM can cause mutation or cancer.

Nope.  Not making much sense.  What exactly do you mean by "true feelings".
 Sure e induces feelings, but so does seeing someone you think is
attractive when you're sober.  Once you get past that front end, the same
ol' chemicals are floating around in your brain.  Gotta remember that
emotions are >all< chemically produced whether you took drugs or not.

I've heard that they don't use nutmeg in most prison kitchens for that
reason.  Kids back home tried morning glory seeds a few times.  Like mildly
tripping acid, but with a crashing headache at the end.

I just happened to be flipping through MTV.com and i found this 
interesting article on Jordana. 
It isnt abled to be linked so i pasted it here...read it if you'd like.

                       The New 1.8.7. 

The woman behind 1.8.7., Jordana LeSesne, one of
the most successful American Drum n' Bass
DJ/Producers today, put herself under a public
microscope two months ago when she revealed her
sex change to the world. What has happened since
then?
MTV: A month and a half after your press release
about the new "1.8.7," have you experienced any
changes in the way the media approaches your
music or you personally? 
"Yes. I would have to say the biggest change is the
sheer amount of attention that I've gotten since
that press release. I knew that would probably be
the case, but it still is a bit new to me. It is also
understandable, people are curious. I would hope
that a year from now people are not still asking me
about the gender stuff; by then it should be
self-evident."
MTV: Bearing in mind that drum n' bass is a
genre that supposedly embraces differences
among people, do you find that to be true when
interacting with the people who make up the scene,
from the average party-goer to the promoters and
other artists? 
"As a whole I would say I find this to be true. Of
course there have been some individuals who have
                        been less than friendly, or have now begun to 
treat
                        me different. One promoter, who I will not name,
                        decided I was no longer worthy of my prime time
                        slot and I instead was put on at 8:30 in the 
morning.
                        It was a bit insulting but not entirely 
unexpected.
                        Incidents like these were bound to happen. 
Again,
                        for the most part people have been really, 
really
                        nice to me and I was overwhelmed with letters of
                        support via my website."

                        MTV: I read in your release that you feel that 
as a
                        woman you will need to work harder to maintain
                        the same level of respect that you have enjoyed
                        until now. How much harder do women (DJs,
                        artists, producers) in the scene have to work, 
in
                        your opinion? 

                        "I think women in the scene have it harder in 
that if
                        they choose to just simply be as good as the 
guys
                        skillwise they will not receive the same 
accolades.
                        Generally we will have to spin, produce, etc., a 
lot
                        longer and be far more consistent than men. It's 
sad
                        but true that quite a few women DJs that have 
the
                        same or even higher skills than their male
                        counterparts don't get booked as often, or get 
put
                        in very bad time slots. This, of course, changes 
if
                        they make a big deal out of the fact that they 
are
                        women and are willing to use "sex appeal" as a
                        selling point. Unfortunately for those of us who
                        don't choose that route, we have to work twice 
as
                        hard. It's a challenge, but not one that is 
entirely
                        unwelcome -- in the end, it pushes me to do 
better."

                        MTV: Another huge announcement that you made
                        with your press release in June was overshadowed
                        by the gender change. You launched a website 
that
                        allows anyone to download any of the drum loops 
in
                        your personal archive for use royalty-free. I
                        interpret that as a strong statement about music
                        today. What's the motivation behind it? 

                        "Yes, it is a shame that so many people missed 
that
                        part of the press release. I believed it was 
actually
                        more important to the public than my gender
                        change. After all, me changing gender had to do
                        with a change in myself; putting my personal
                        sample archive on the net for use royalty-free 
is an
                        action that I hope changes fundamentally the way
                        this music is produced.

                        "For instance, a lot of the U.K. guys take great
                        pride in the fact that they have somehow kept
                        certain beats, techniques, etc., secret or only
                        known among a certain circle of elite
                        DJs/producers. I believe that this hurts the 
music in
                        that many who might otherwise have brilliant 
ideas
                        for songs have no idea how to go about putting
                        them together -- that lack of new ideas leads to
                        stagnation. Once the basic raw materials are
                        available to a person free of charge, the 
creativity
                        flows. I believe this approach is specifically
                        important to the drum n' bass scene in the U.S.
                        because many people are spread out, if not by
                        hundreds of miles, thousands of miles, unlike 
the
                        scene in the UK in which many producers all live 
in
                        the same location, i.e. London, Bristol, etc. I 
did
                        this so some kid out in the middle of Iowa who 
may
                        not have the latest gear, or the huge expensive
                        sample CD collection, but has talent, can go to 
my
                        site: www.187.nu, download the beats, and work
                        with them on their computer or sampler and maybe
                        create the next drum n' bass anthem.

                        "I believe it also fits our system of a 
bottom-up,
                        "we the people" democracy better than the U.K.
                        model of elite beat-hoarding which is more based
                        on their top-down monarchy-like system. I would
                        hope all drum n' bass artists would follow suit, 
but I
                        doubt that will happen. That said, I took my 
stand,
                        so the ball is squarely in their court now."

                        MTV: What's your take on major drum n' bass
                        artists enjoying commercial success? 

                        "I believe that all the major drum n' bass 
artists
                        enjoying commercial success have earned it. I 
don't
                        take the view that success is inherently bad. It 
is
                        what you do with your success that makes it 
either
                        good or bad in the long run. I would hope they
                        would find some way to give back to the
                        community that put them there. I know to the
                        cynical that sounds like some 
"hippy-dippy-flakey"
                        ideal, but I sincerely believe it, and believe 
me, I'm
                        no hippy. Putting their drums on the Net would 
be
                        a great gesture (hint, hint)."

                        MTV: Is the mainstream evil? 

                        "The mainstream is neither good or evil, it just 
is.
                        Many people take music very seriously and very
                        personal, so when their favorite artist or style 
of
                        music receives mainstream attention they feel 
they
                        have to defend it against the prying eyes of 
others
                        who weren't "down with the music since day one."
                        It's a rather immature thing to do because in 
the
                        end no amount of mainstream stories, releases, 
etc.,
                        will ever kill the underground where the music 
is
                        born. Only the underground can kill the
                        underground. They are the only ones who have the
                        power to see the music, scene, whatever, evolve 
or
                        stagnate. Stagnation is a sure sign that the
                        underground is in trouble. Unfortunately, it 
often
                        coincides with mainstream attention and
                        unfortunately the mainstream gets the blame when
                        an underground goes -- pardon the pun -- under."

                        MTV: Do you ever see yourself signed to a major
                        label? 

                        "I wouldn't mind as long as I had the same kind 
of
                        relationship with them that I currently have 
with
                        Liquid Sky. That said, I know of no major labels
                        which have that kind of relationship with their
                        artists. Liquid Sky is like a family, not just 
the
                        artists but the staff of the label itself. I 
know that
                        sounds like a clich but it truly is a pleasure
                        working with them; we all know each other and 
are
                        on a first-name basis. These are people who I
                        would enjoy hanging out with even if I wasn't on
                        the label. Anyway, I don't see myself going
                        anywhere else soon; what we've tried to build is 
far
                        from complete."

                        MTV: In a growing world of multi-thousand
                        pre-recorded DAT performances, where does
                        1.8.7. stand? What percentage of your sets is 
live?

                        "I have never used a DAT for a live performance
                        and I've taken others to task for it. When many 
of
                        the major "electronica" acts (who get paid far 
more
                        than I do) can get away with putting a DAT on 
and
                        pretending to play their keyboards and twiddle
                        knobs -- it says a lot about the audience, but a 
lot
                        more about the acts themselves. Of course they 
go
                        through many pains to obscure their use of a DAT
                        under another level of secrecy.

                        "I'm from the punk-rock school of thought; if it 
isn't
                        live, then it really is cheating your audience. 
The
                        only way I would ever use a DAT for a live
                        performance is if, one, the audience knew 
already
                        that it was off of DAT and could choose to come 
to
                        the show or not, and, two, there was really no 
other
                        way to reproduce the performance."

                        MTV: In a recent study conducted by MTV about
                        up-and-coming music genres, jungle was one of
                        the most popular. Does that surprise you at all? 

                        "It doesn't surprise me at all. Jungle and drum 
n'
                        bass, more so than many other forms of 
electronica,
                        seem to cover the full range of musical 
possibilities
                        and human emotion. There is so much room for
                        cross-genre experimentation and cross-cultural
                        pollination that it appeals to many people whose
                        other musical tastes couldn't be more different. 
I
                        feel that jungle and drum n' bass are like
                        soundscapes for life itself, and many people
                        instantly pick up on that from their first 
listen,
                        which explains its popularity."

                        MTV: When is your new release coming out? 

                        "The new album, Quality Rolls, will be in stores
                        August 25 on Liquid Sky Music/Caroline
                        Distribution."

                        MTV: How does it evolve from When Worlds
                        Collide?

                        "It is technically better, I learned a lot about
                        producing in between the two. It is also more
                        dancefloor-oriented than When Worlds Collide,
                        which had a lot more mellow, jazzy tracks. 
Quality
                        Rolls is a bit angrier, up-front and bold. It is 
a more
                        accurate representation of what you'd likely 
hear
                        when I spin or play live. People expecting 
another
                        When Worlds Collide will be surprised, in a good
                        way."

                        MTV: You have been praised by magazines
                        instrumental to the dance culture, like Mixmag
                        and URB. Is that the recognition you seek to 
keep
                        going? If not, what kind of recognition is
                        important to you? 

                        "I think being praised by both publications is a
                        great honor. I respect and have been a reader of
                        both since they began. That said, I would hope
                        they continue to enjoy my work. The kind of
                        recognition that is really important to me is 
the
                        kind that comes from dance culture itself. The
                        average partygoer doesn't necessarily need 
anyone
                        to tell them what's cool. They already know it. 
So
                        long as I continue to receive the recognition 
from
                        them, then I will be happy. That said, 
recognition is
                        only a good thing if you deserve it, and I would
                        hope that if I released a really bad track or 
had a
                        really bad set, that hype would not overshadow
                        critical evaluation. Evolution can only be
                        productive if it is pushed by a dynamic
                        environment."

                        It is within that environment that Jordana 
LeSesne
                        emerged and grew. And it is within that
                        environment that she will continue to evolve as 
a
                        female musician. With her emphasis on creativity
                        flow and new ideas -- as opposed to royalties 
and
                        big record deals -- as well as her willingness 
to give
                        back to the community that ranked her among the
                        top drum 'n' bass artists, she sets a living 
example
                        of what dance culture is all about -- in its 
purest
                        form.

supposed to be opening for the verve when I happened to be going there
so i got tix.  then of couse they pulled out of the tour and i was
extremely upset.  i didn't think i'd get to see them but just by chance

I rather liked Geekboy's post because I saw a certain side of myself
in it, and although our stories are different, our ends may be very
similar.

Until I was 19, I was a fucking asshole.  I took the straight edge
philosophy and perverted it beyond recognition.  I refused to
associate with people who smoke or drank.  I preached about the
dangers of lsd lodging in your spine, and I truly believed that
ecstasy meant an almost certain and painful death.  I wore my DARE
shirt with pride, and I came *that* close to getting X's tatooed on my
hands.

Now, for those of you who know me now, or least know me by my posts --
hard to believe, ain't it?  I was an ignorant, judgmental fuck.  I was
very angry at the world and I was very sad.  I couldn't understand why
people would do the same drugs that we supposedly learned as children
would hurt us.

I had a lot of growing up to do.  

Then a person came into my life and told me that lsd was physically
harmless, or at least much, much less potential harmful than I had
ever thought.  I laughed and laughed.  But I respected this person a
lot, so I left my mind open, this one time.  He person said, "I'll
send you some information."  Well, the rest is history.  He sent me
over 1000 pages of medical research dating from the 50's to the
present -- which was only the start for me. And I read every word of
it, and researched on my own before I ever decided to actually try the
stuff for myself.

Now I view drugs -- all drugs -- as very valuable psychological tools.
 I am a different person now and it is due partially to letting the
use of some drugs into my life.

I discovered MDMA a little over a year ago, and through the in-depth,
soul-probing conversations I have shared with others (especially my
boyfriend) while under its influence I have completely worked through
and every problem, and I am gradually becoming a more outgoing,
non-judgmental person.

If anyone wants to read accounts of real people who haved undergone
MDMA therapy (since that was its main use in the 70's), one should
read the MDMA chapter in PIHKaL by Alexander Shulgin.  There are
accounts of people for whom years of therapy did nothing -- but one
afternoon on MDMA helped them get beyond personality blocks that had
hindered them from being able to live their lives effectively for
their whole lives.

The abuse and mis-use of drugs makes me sick -- and yes, I'm sure a
few people go nuts while they're rolling at a party and may end up
doing something they may not have done while sober.  But I don't.  I
feel just as much my normal self while on E as I do any other time.

The happiness may be *unnatual* -- but fake?  No way.

Wait, you took all those pills *all at once* -- a complete abuse of
the drug itself -- and then in the next breath say you hate all
anti-depressants?  My god!  I have friends who would be six feet under

If you're driving down the road thinking that you're going in the right
direction and it ends up that you aren't, were you really lost to begin
with?
Just kidding--I always say this to Rich when he pulls out the Philosophy
degree on me.  I'm just a simple gal.

Modulations was pretty cool.  The movie looked nice, but it was obvious
that the woman that made it didn't know too much about techno & raves
beforehand.  Some interesting interviews though.  Some of the DJs &
performers come off as eloquent and intelligent, some as pretentious
idioits.  Check out the movie's home page:
http://www.caipirinha.com/Film/modulations/modcontents.html . 

Her other movie, Synthetic Pleasures, was killer.  It was about how new
technologies are changing everything and hit on raves a bit.

People can justify (with validity)
their personal opinion

So all this arguement and banter

No position is right or wrong,

at this point in time, i believe that aside from any possible harmful 
side effects, that drugs or intoxicants of any type used too often or 
uncontrolled are bad....but the things tht i find particularly bad are 
the substnces that create "euphoria" like e and anti 
depressants....other drugs arent quite so geared towards happiness....
also, i think any drug used as an "excape" is being misused

its in the compilation of short stories called "welcome to the monkey 
house" ...every story in it is fucking wonderful....theres a love story 
in it involving a soldier on leave, and its only 3 pages long, yet i cry 
every time i read it(if someone knows the name of te story, id 
appreciate it if you told me, as i cant find my copy of that 
book)...kurt vonnegut was a genius.....but i still havent been able to 
make it all the way through "cats cradle"...everything else iv read by 
him was TOP FUCKING NOTCH.
his style of writing is similar to that of irvine welsh of 
"trainspotting" fame..both of them are top authors in my eyes

synthvortx@aol.com doesnt like the way i run the rom and says hyperreal is
a joke and is concerned about the state of the rom with the beastie boys
and front 242 listed on it.  comments to trout@hyperreal.org

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events, just testing this out and we'll see what the
reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

F-S Sep 25-27                    EQUINOX GATHERING                Harrisville, WV

This gathering will be located on a 250 acre homestead, in Harrisville,
West Virginia. We will be using the 6000 watt lovelab soundsystem. It will
be $5 at the door.  All proceeds go to the non-profit organization called
the Mon Valley green-space coalition.

The purpose of this event is to bridge societal gaps (cultural, spatial,
or generation) by providing a bases for commonality.  As we take the time
to notice the changing of the season we are reminded that the Earth
supports us all; granting us life from her vast, yet dilapidating
resources.  This event is to be one of celebration for the life which
flows through us all.  It is our hope that this gathering will provide a
platform upon which we can all learn from one another. We will be
discussing both the endangered greenspace on campus (the old stadium) and
the Blackwater Canyon forest. 

This is to be a three day, two night event.  The system will be shut off
during the day, giving way to other activities such as yoga, hiking, &
drumming.  There will be a family dinner Saturday night followed by dance
meditation and an opening circle, leading into funkadelic, techno
vibrations.

We ask that people bring a donation for the kitchen.  Every person should
bring approximately $10 worth of raw ingredients. Contributions merit
'food bracelets' which when presented to the kitchen will allow you to eat
(as long as supplies last).  Also, any additions to Saturday night's
pot-luck will be greatly appreciated:)

Sat Nov 28                        ENERGIZE                               DC

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year
history. It is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for
it to do to the dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond. It will
be held in the massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in
this space before, none will compare to the excellence of Energize.  The
main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one
wide-open, high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set
Energize apart from our previous events is that we have now been
approved to use the basement! Don't think basement like dark and dingy
though, this basement has ceilings of 40', and makes the biggest dance
clubs on the East Coast look like efficiency apartments in Manhattan.
Plus it's divided up into rooms of various sizes. For the first time at
the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all with full on
concert level production in both sound and lighting.

The rooms will be: The Main Arena: We will fill this space with the
biggest sound system we have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning
combination of lasers, projection screens and intelligent lights. We are
still waiting for final confirmation of 2 more djs and one live act, but
so far we've got:  DOC MARTIN Los Angelos ICEY Zone, Orlando SCOTT HENRY
Buzz, DC (not bad for a start)

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena: In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the
undisputed champions of the U.K. scene. This area will be hosted by 2
Tuff productions of DC. The lineup is:  GROOVERIDER Sony, Prototype,
U.K. FABIO U.K. MC GQ the U.K.'s premier MC DARA Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY Platinum, Philadelphia AK1200 Orlando DB Breakbeat Science,
NYC SLANT 2 Tuff, DC ENTITY Ultraworld FLUID Sonic Soul, Baltimore MCS
NES, MECHA, SYSTEM

The Deep House Arena: This third area, also in the basement, is bigger
then any dance club on the East Coast. It will be hosted by
Philadelphia's Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long. The performers are: DERRICK
CARTER Chicago GLOBAL COMMUNICATION Universal Language, U.K. FEELGOOD
Charm City Records, Baltimore JAVATE Dirty Crew, DC O'KEEFE Circle,
Philly ROB PAINE Circle, Philly SEAN THOMAS Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena: The smallest area of the event, but still bigger
then the main room at most clubs! This room will be hosted by
Baltimore's respected Sonic Sould crew, and will feature the downtempo
side of electronic music. You can dance if you want to, with performers:
TIM "LOVE" LEE Tummy Touch, U.K. PETE LAWRENCE the Big Chill, U.K. WE
performing live Asphodel, NYC LOVEGROVE Sonic Soul DJ C Toneburst,
Boston RHOMBUS Sonic Soul What makes this event even more exciting, is
the fact that it will be a collaborative effort between Ultraworld,
Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.

While Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction
for the event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically
manage the areas of music they are most interested in. What that means
for you is that you get the highest quality of production and care going
into every aspect of the event. Tickets will be going on sale in mid
September, and will be broken down as follows: There will be 1000
tickets sold for only $20! So if you know you're going to go, you have
the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low price. After those 1000
are gone the price will be $25 up to and including October 31.  On
November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that
price even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets. Admission at the
gate will be $35. We are compiling the list of ticket outlets now, and
in addition to the stores, tickets will be available through
Ticketmaster. So if you don't have an outlet near you, don't worry, you
will be able to purchase tickets through them. Also, we are working with
the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend. For those of you who may
not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held every Friday by DJ's
Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt. It plays host to the world's top DJ's
and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of the best in the
country. When you purchase your ticket to Energize, you will get a
coupon which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for only $5.
Consider coming to DC on Friday, and making a long stay of it. We'll
post hotel and travel info on this site in the weeks to come. After
you've had your turkey, and are over the family thing, remember, the
place to be for Thanksgiving weekend will be the nation's capital for
ULTRAWORLD ENERGIZE!

Man I cain't wait till turkey day.

You are ignoring the fact that sometimes, for some people, there is
no problem to deal with. They are simply depressed. Some people are
manic-depressive, some have clinical depression. If your brain
chemistry is out of wack, it can be physically impossible to lift
yourself out of the depression. Some people really do need drugs
just to be able to function normally.

Huh?!? Do you just have a problem with people being happy in general,
or what? Euphoria is bad? Is misery good then? By your reasoning,
alcohol is a better drug than E, just because it is not as much fun.
Hell, cigarettes are the best because they are no fun at all. 

There was an article in last months Scientific American saying that
the dopamine levels in kids playing video games were just as high
as when they were on amphetamines. Is video game playing a bad thing
then? Why should we not be able to use any means at our disposal to
make ourselves happy? As long as doing drugs does not take over
your life, why shouldn't it be another form of entertainment?

>also, i think any drug used as an "excape" is being misused
>toM

What's wrong with an escape sometimes? I am not talking about doing
drugs every day, or even every week. If someone wants to trip once
in a while, why is it any different than going to an amusement park
or other recreational activity?

Jesus is right.  


Drugs such as E seem to increase any feelings/emotions you have at the 
present time.  It doesn't make you fake.  It makes you real-- Sometimes 
embarrassingly real.  What you feel is there at an event such as a rave 
or party of sort there is no reason why one should not express that.  
Now at the supermarket things are just not as tasty.

After all the posts on Fake hugs and drugs, I still dont know if we have all
lost respect for each others opinions or not.  This is turning into a battle
of words.  I know I dont know anybody here, but  I have respected everybodys
opinions, has everybody else, or am I just not getting it?  There are times
when people want to do drugs, not due to unhappyness, or depression, or
medical reasons, they just want to have a new experience.  Never once have I
had the same experience.  Doing drugs is a learning experience.  And about E,
I dont think it induces emotions, but intensifies them.  On it, we do not fear
rejection, that is why we say shit.  Sometimes there are expremes, but I
actually think that we all here are beyond that point, only because it seems
like we have experienced it before.  I for one am consciencely awear of all my
actions on drugs, and I know when to say shit, and when not to.  There might
be people that dont want to cope with emotions they feel, and want to hug, and
say "I love you" and meaning it even if they have never seen you before!  My
first time on E was like that, only bceause I have never had those same locked
up emotions unleashed before, and I couldnt cope with them.  I think I am
getting off the subjct a little...  Anyways, its all about respecting
decisions, even if they are wrong.  I joined the rave sceen, only because
there was respect involved.  I am not against drugs, I am just against
abusers.  Use them wisely

Hugh

I didn't want to really come down on either side of the "fake hugs" deal, but
after all this discussion I would feel left out if I didn't say something.
First drugs only seem to accentuate what you are feeling.  Take for example
the most abused drug, alcohol, if you are depressed you might kill yourself or
someone else, but if you are happy it will seem that you will be happier.  If
the hugs at the rave were fake then everyone would be hugging everyone else
just for the great feeling you get.  I have a friend that took E at a rave and
he had just been arguing with his girlfriend.  The E did nothing for him,
except make him feel a little weird.  Judging from all the smiles I see at the
rave,  most everyone comes with a positive attitude.  And generally you
wouldn't do anything on drugs that you would not do otherwise.  For example
sex feels wonderful on E but there is not a higher instance of fornication
among ravers, as compared to any other group of people.  If the people that
are on drugs at the rave are adults, please let them do what they want, that
is why they leave their parents at home.  Any how this was just a thought,
have a good time at the rave, straight or drug enhanced. p.L.u.R. {:-]  mark

The only other point I wanted to make is that I know a lot of fake people that
are straight, maybe they should take som acid or E so I know how they really
feel.

well this will be my final word on this subject. think of it this way. Someone
has a headache, they take tylenol and the headache goes away. Is the "good"
feeling of not having a headache fake? The fact is tylenol is legal so when
someone takes it no one has a problem or they don't second guess the nature of
the final result. E is illegal therefore everything about it is second
guessed. Thank ya :)

Here's my suggestion:

If you plan on producing drum 'n' bass, breaks, or house, get a sampler.
The MPC2000, Ensoniq ASR-x, EMU e6400, EMU E-synth, and Yamaha A3000 are
all really good.

For trance and techno, get one of 'em groovy new analog physical modeling
synths such as the Yamaha ANIX, the Roland JP8000, Nord Lead, and
Novation SuperBassStation.

You'll also need a sequencer.  I'd recommend using your computer if
possible but I'm sure there are also people who would urge you to get a
dedicated 
sequencer thingy.  The bad thing about computers is hauling them and
setting them up at PAs.  They're perfect for studios, though.  No floppy
disks or hard to read LCDs.  yeck.

If you've got lots of money ($2000 or more) to spend, get everything you need
in a workstation like the Yamaha EX-5.  And then sell it to me when
you're done with it. :)

If you don't have money, go with the software synths.  They sound pretty
good, actually.  Problems do arise, however, when you try to start using
them with real equipment.  

Yup...

a lot of times a simple "i love you" or my personal favorite, the
eloquent "i love this shit" is as close as you can get to expressing
what's inside of you w/o sounding like a babbling idoit, which would
be something along the lines of:

"i love this rave, i love this music, i love all these people, i love
the fact that all these people love this rave and this music, i love
you for being such a kick-ass person, i love your nifty hat, i love my
friend over there, she's grrrrreat, i love dancing, i dont want to
stop dancing, i love the fact that i don't want to stop dancing, i
love this baby powder on the ground that you can slide around on, i
love this bottle of water, damn - i really love this dj, i love the
fact that i don't have to leave for another 3 hours!, i'm really happy
you're here to share this with me, oooh shit - i love this song...
gottagodancecausethissong'sabouttobreak!!!!" <fake>*hug*

and that's all i have to say about that.

well, you can't make generalizations like that when it comes to
psychiatric problems. there are of course, varying degrees of
depression, stemming from various sources. some people do need to work
through their problems, say if they have been avoiding dealing with
stress, abuse, whatever. however, some people have _chronic_ depression,
bipolar disorder, etc., which results from a chemical imbalance and
requires the use of medication.
the problem is that americans think that they need to be happy all the
time, so prozac & other antidepressants get prescribed like candy for
all kinds of temporary depressions, hyperactivity, etc. and this I do
not support. it is natural for every one to have mood cycles and times
of depression and I think people need to realize that, but there are
also valid physical reasons why some people need to take medication.

oh well since everybody else is doing it,

all hugs are good

if someone gives you a hug when they are in an altered state and wouldn't
normally, they prolly need a good hug more than anyone, and it just *may*
change their attitudes or leave em a bit more affectionate/caring when
they come down

if someone gives you hugs all the time and are always seem to be in an
altered state they probably need a good hug too, and maybe a friend's
advice so they dont burn out

if someone gives you a hug sober, all da bettah!

plur,

jbrick

Just had to add my comment, and this will be all I say on it:

I LOVE HUGS...
I dont much care who they come from, or under what circumstances. 
They feel good, and, like Jello, there is always room for more. ;-)

i watched an interview on the canadian music channel (MUCH) and they had the
behind-the-scenes type thing of the movie. They said it was created by
identical twin brothers, and they were actually interviewed on the show. The
movie looked interesting, i think it focused on a few different djs including
junior vasquez, but i could be wrong.

HEy kids, I will be there.  It was a tough decision though.  It was between
this and Psychosis in chicago.  I wanted to see Misjah again.  He was thee
shit at Liquid.  Amazing, amazing set.  I decided an rabbit ( or confuscious,
which ever it may be) cause of thee distance and I gotta work Monday Morn.
Look for me.  I just got these phat ass pants via mail order.  They are 60
inch cargos with black and white ZEBRA print.  I should stick out a little. My
name is Jeremy.  Look for me upstairs on thee carpet by all thee couches,
thats where I usually dance at Trilogy.  Hope to meet some ov you there.
Peace.

 Okay....I was going to ignore it hoping it would go away, but the subject
keeps lingering so here's my two cents worth.
 
 I am and always have been a very "touchy feely" person.  I LOVE hugging
people and kissing people (you know what I mean....I AM married:-) )  I was
always disturbed by those people that backed off or squirmed away and looked
at me thinking I was crazy. (I am 29, I just started with the E in March and I
don't do it often)  I always wondered if they ever got any "lovin'" from their
parents when they were kids....my mom was always lovin' us to death and I
really enjoyed it.  My whole family is like that.  It is a very good thing.  I
guess that society today doesnt appreciate a good hug.  Maybe that's why
everyone is so stressed out these days.  I know that I feel much better after
a shitty day coming home and getting a big hug from hubby or from my friends. 
 
 When I started going to "raves" in March.....It was the most uplifting
experience I've ever had.  The scene was incredible....happy happy fun loving
ravers!!  YEAH!  How refreshing to see people that weren't afraid of showing
their feelings!  I was hugging all of the people that I met that night...long
before I took the E.  After that.....all I can say is WOW!  It just made
everything feel better....I didn't feel that anything I was doing was "fake".
I walked around for weeks afterward thanking GOD that I had found my "place".
Giving backrubs, hugs, candy, kisses made me feel like a human being again in
this world.  I have a very stressful job.....I sometimes forget how important
people and feelings are.  
 
 I don't know about anyone else....all I know is that my hugs, kisses, and
backrubs are anything but fake.  I can see everyone's point and opinion on
this subject.  I just want everyone to know that if I see you out...you're
getting a hug from the old redhead from Erie, PA.  Whether I am on E or not.
It makes me sad to think that anyone thinks that I would have any other
intention than to show a fellow human being that I care and that they would
think that I am on drugs that make me feel that way.  TOO SAD.  Maybe I am too
old for this scene......I just thought that I was actually fitting in
here....this is breaking my heart:-(  
 
 If anyone would like to continue this topic...any other opinions....PLEASE
FEEL FREE to E-mail me personally.
 
 Love, hugs, and kisses,
 
 Lorianne

It is definately just DJ Confuscious.  DEFINATELY.   As well as 2 other dj's
I believe.  Maybe 3.
It was not an attempt at false advertising or shadey promoters.   If
anything, the misunderstanding is because the promoter is new to the "rave"
scene and was mis-lead by the booking agency he uses.  I believe that
Trilogy is doing something in an attempt to make up for the false
advertising.   Possibly a reduced cover and maybe a couple goodies or
something.  I don't know for sure about that, but I do know for sure that
bunny will not be there.

>that workout song:
>bob sinclair - on the album "paradise" - i think it is called "gym
>tonic" but i'm not sure (just guessin by the name). they have a 12" @
>hypervinyl - a white label that is currently in the "re-shelve" pile
>but it wont be there for long so look around :)


I have several copies of the Spacedust remix of Gym n Tonic.  Don't be
thrown off -- Spacedust was the group that remixed "music sounds better with
you" and now they have taken on bob sinclairs "gym n tonic".  (that's the
jane fonda thing)

There is also another bootleg going around called the Gym N Tonic EP.   This
a bootleg of what appears to be the above mentioned remix.  They throw the
buckheads "got myself together" over it.  Similar to Suntmasters bootleg of
Madonna and Spacedust.


There is also a bootleg going around with all the versions of "music sounds
better with you" -- though i haven't seen it yet.


God these french people are confusing!!!  Bob sinclair isn't even a real
person!

Wish is opening tonight (friday) with a VIP/Press party from 6-9.  It opens
to the public at 9.  It will also be 21+ over.  This is what is going on:

Wednesdays - In the Business night w/ DJ Whatever - I think it's gonna be
trip hop/jungle/etc.   Similar to Sunday at Spy.  I could be wrong about the
format for this night.

Thursdays - Alter House - A tribute to Alter House with a rotating lineup of
Dj's.  (Alyssa, Ian Mariano, Eddie Lyngel were names tossed around)
Goth/Industrial/Progresive/Etc

Fridays & Saturdays - The music is gonna be "cool commercial".   I am doing
friday, and I know Mike Filly is doing this saturday.  The owner has
expressed his concern that it is not all "house music" all night.   So I
guess we'll find out what that means.

Sunday - Worship -  Cleveland Underground at its finest.  Mike Filly and a
rotation of local dj's make this the underground night at Wish.

Hope this helps

How much is Motive-if you pre buy or bring canned food.  Does anyone 
know?  Is anyone going?  Its weird living in Columbus now.  I forgot 
what it is like.  WEll, If anyone goes we should meet and everyone can 
meet my CREW. The kids that introduced the scene here to me.  Pittsburgh 
is a different story. I miss it though, especially since I just met some 
of you.

PLEASE READ BELOW!!!!!

David Christopher (DJ Confuscious) of Rabbit in the Moon was involved in a
really bad car accident last night. The accident crushed his leg and from
what I heard he was lucky that he wasn't killed. (ie. if the car was
6inches to the left... :(  )
 The broken/crushed  leg seems to be the extent of his injuries, but he
will not be able to make this weekends show.
David appoligized (like he had to... come on he broke his leg... we all
understand!) and said he would reschedule the show as soon as he can get up
and about.

SO..... NO SHOW SATURDAY, DO NOT SHOW UP, IT WILL BE RESCHEDULED SOON!!!!!

Thanks,
Sleepy

this is a longer winding bitter post from me, if you dont like it, well
delete it then. oh and there is a bit at the bottom about it being
cancelled, so maybe skip to that and then delete it.

here it is not an attempt at false advertising.

here trilogy is making up for false advertising.
well let me look at my flyer.
"invertigo productions presents hallucination recording artists
rabbit in the moon (with a big ritm logo)"
below is "dj confucius"
in a box "also opening sonshine galactic records toledo"
in anonter box "sat. sept 19 trilogy 2325 elm st cleveland, flats info-line
800-846-6951"

boy a scanner would be convenient!   anyhow right in the center of a flyer
is a rabbit in the moon logo about the size of a silver dollar.  and it
says rabbit in the moon around it.   pretty unmistakeable, no small "will
not be appearing" like rob sherwoods daft punk flyers.  and to add to it,
the flyer sez "hallucination recording artists" right above.   attempt to
mislead?  i'd have to say so, considering they are not going to be there.  

oh and to add to the mess:

Let me chime in too . . . the Erie scene is not the largest, but in my
opinion it's one of the most enjoyable around!  I love Erie people too!  

Just think of all the good ones just from this list:
Megan Dwyer, Lorianne, Junglealien, Joe Cross . . . hell, Viktor Mizo was
an Erie resident before he went to Harvard (which incidentally is the most
awful school in the world next to Princeton).

I've seen that commercial quite a few times (I like cartoons).  I didn't
actually realize that there were tables in the background until yesterday!

I think that I already respect and admire the majority of this lists opinions
and having met and become friends w/ alot of you, I am proud of the
brain trust that has evolved out of this.
Sharing, learning, growing........ the pains we share in life.
As individuals, as well as a collective group.

Not to start another plur discussion but, while I will neither condone
or condemn individuals for drug usage...... I do not respect those that
abuse _anything_.

If you are known to others by the people that you surround yourself
with (guilt by association), then I am very happy w/ the direction
in life that I have had by keeping the plur values and sharing that
reciprocity w/ the group. A few of my best friends on this list have had,
and always will have, my undying support in whatever way seems
possible because they are honest and direct enough to share their thoughts
in a peaceful, loving, respectful manner. (creating the unity)
Terms like : YMMV and IMHO are significant pointers showing how we
as the "geek" (read:computer literate) share these values.

Just my 2 cents, eh?     *smiles* (as always)

does anybody need a ride to hullabaloo 7? amy (from kent) and i are going
and we have space for 8 more passengers in 2 cars. this is the tentative
route i've come up with: strongsville to streetsboro to kent, back to
streetsboro, 480 w to 271 n to 90 e to 190 w to queen elizabeth way w to
provincial highway 427 nw to provincial highway 401 ne. so if you're at
least kind of close to this and need a ride, we should be able to pick you
up. i don't know if we'll need both cars or not, but i would like nobody
to smoke anything in my car please if i take it, but i don't care if we
make 10 rest stops or whatever. i'm planning on leaving strongsville at
noon at the latest. remember to buy your tickets presale. this is really
weird, i can buy mine at work (from ticketmaster).

after watching this debate for what seems like eons now, i have to throw my
two cents in.  i couldn't care less what drug anyone chooses to enhance
themselves with, theres two points that must be made:

1. being able to integrate your drug expriences with your sober life is
   a #1 concern of mine.

2. never allow intoxication to become an excuse for anything.

thats all.

this is just sick...david christopher just had his leg crushed
and almost died in a car accident and certain individuals are
still more concerned about tearing down an RITM event...granted
techno may be created by cold and heartless machines, but
try and preserve your humanity people...check your motives...

on a slightly more positive note, just thought i'd drop some
knowledge that Rabbit In The Moon was actually the name of
an old native american indian legend.

here is the tale from the rainbow family of light web sight...

--------(begin clip www.welcomehome.org/rainbow.html)----------

Rabbit and the Moon

Long ago, Rabbit was a great hunter. He lived with his grandmother in a 
lodge which stood deep in the Micmac forest. It was winter and Rabbit 
set traps and laid snares to catch game for food. He caught many small 
animals and birds, until one day he discovered that some mysterious 
being was robbing his traps. Rabbit and his grandmother became hungry. 
Though he visited his traps very early each morning, he always found
them empty.  At first Rabbit thought that the robber might be a cunning
wolverine, until one morning he found long, narrow footprints alongside 
his trap line. It was, he thought, the tracks of the robber, but they look=
ed 
like moonbeams. Each morning Rabbit rose earlier and earlier, but the 
being of the long foot was always ahead of him and always his traps were
empty. 

Rabbit made a trap from a bowstring with the loop so cleverly fastened 
that he felt certain that he would catch the robber when it came. He 
took one end of the thong with him and hid himself behind a clump of 
bushes from which he could watch his snare. It was bright moonlight 
while he waited, but suddenly it became very dark as the moon 
disappeared. A few stars were still shining and there were no clouds in 
the sky, so Rabbit wondered what had happened to the moon. 

Someone or something came stealthily through the trees and then Rabbit 
was almost blinded by a flash of bright, white light which went straight 
to his trap line and shone through the snare which he had set. Quick as 
a lightning flash, Rabbit jerked the bowstring and tightened the noose. 
There was a sound of struggling and the light lurched from side to side. 
Rabbit knew b the tugging on his string that he had caught the robber. 
He fastened the bowstring to a nearby sapling to hold the loop tight. 

Rabbit raced back to tell his grandmother, who was a wise old woman, 
what had happened. She told him that he must return at once and see who 
or what he had caught. Rabbit, who was very frightened, wanted to wait 
for daylight but his grandmother said that might be too late, so he 
returned to his trap line. 

When he came near his traps, Rabbit saw that the bright light was still 
there. It was so bright that it hurt his eyes. He bathed them in the icy 
water of a nearby brook, but still they smarted. He made big snowballs 
and threw them at the light, in the hope of putting it out. As they went 
close to the light, he heard them sizzle and saw them melt. Next, Rabbit 
scooped up great pawfuls of soft clay from the stream and made many big 
clay balls. He was a good shot and threw the balls with all of his force 
at the dancing white light. He heard them strike hard and then his 
prisoner shouted. 

Then a strange, quivering voice asked why he had been snared and 
demanded that he be set free at once, because he was the man in the moon 
and he must be home before dawn came. His face had been spotted with 
clay and, when Rabbit went closer, the moon man saw him and threatened 
to kill him and all of his tribe if he were not released at once. 

Rabbit was so terrified that he raced back to tell his grandmother about 
his strange captive. She too was much afraid and told Rabbit to return 
and release the thief immediately. Rabbit went back, and his voice shook 
with fear as he told the man in the moon that he would be released if he 
promised never to rob the snares again. To make doubly sure, Rabbit 
asked him to promise that he would never return to ear, and the moon man 
swore that he would never do so. Rabbit could hardly see in the dazzling 
light, but at last he managed to gnaw through the bowstring with his 
teeth and the man in the moon soon disappeared in the sky, leaving a 
bright trail of light behind him. 

Rabbit had been nearly blinded by the great light and his shoulders were 
badly scorched. Even today, rabbits blink as though light is too strong 
for their eyes; their eyelids are pink, and their eyes water if they 
look at a bright light. Their lips quiver, telling of Rabbit's terror. 

The man in the moon has never returned to earth. When he lights the 
world, one can still see the marks of the clay which Rabbit threw on his 
face. Sometimes he disappears for a few nights, when he is trying to rub 
the marks of the clay balls from his face. Then the world is dark; but 
when the man in the moon appears again, one can see that he has never 
been able to clean the clay marks from his shining face. 

--------(end clip from www.welcomehome.org/rainbow.html)-------

i guess the moral of the story is similar to that of Moby Dick and Old
Man and the Sea by Hemmingway...you may be the best hunter or fisherman
out there, but there's always that one rabbit or fish that is greater than
you...and you should just let go...or suffer the consequences...

well, here where there is a large difference between you and i....i 
definitely feel that hugging and kissing are things that i share only 
with those that i care about.....i dont normally like people right 
away...i have to get to know them first, so im kinda against hugging 
just any random old person....there are some people whom ive met via 
this list that i care about enough to hug when i see them.....but like i 
said, im not gonna be very cool about hugging just any random 
persom....if you see me hugging someone, you KNOW its for real, and i 
care about them a whole bunch.......oh well, differences are good.....

Thanx for that tidbit ov info.  That is an interesting story.  As for David
Christopher I am concerned for his health and do you have any more details on
thee subject?  Is he in critical condition?  Will he be able to continue to
walk.  At first I just thought maybe thee info about thee show was a coy to
throw some people off and reduce thee crowd,  you never can tell.  i was just
looking forward to thee show, whether it be RITM or Dj Cofuscious, either way
it would have been a great time.  I am just kind ov upset cause I passed up a
seat to Chicago for Psychosis to stick around her and attend thee event at
Trilogy.  Now I don't know what to do this weekend.  I just need to get out
and have a good time.  I havent been attending parties very readily and its
getting to me.  I am not one ov those kids who treats parties like a big swap
meet.  i am actually quite a loner at parties.  I love to dance and thats what
I spend thee majority of my tome at parties doin.  I have loved dancin since I
was little.  Dancin to Michael Jackson, Fatboys stuff like that.  Then I got
into thee industrial and acid house scene through artists like Skinny Puppy,
Psychic TV ( Jack Tha Tab ), and different stuff like that.  I have been under
alot ov stress ( I am sure everyone has their amount ov stress ).  I have a
baby on thee way,  been workin 60 hour weeks and shit, and dancin is my main
form of release and expression ov feelings.  I am not thee best at putting
things into words.  I feel that SOUNDs and Motions can express emotions that
just cannot be put into words ( for me at least ). I want to be a good father
to my child and raise her to be accepting ov all people and have an open mind
towards all aspects ov life.  I personally see thee ugly and beuty in
everything i observe and I try to concentrate on thee beauty in things.  My
MOTIVES i guess would be to see people start having an open mind to other
peoples opinions.  Lately it seems whenever someone expresses an opinion they
get crucified for feeling thee way they do.  I would also like to see thee
scene get more creative cause it seems to be getting awfully repetitive.  My
other form of release is music,  I compose experimental beats, in an attempt
to take thee electronic genre ov music to new levels.  Sorry for rambling on I
just felt I had alot to say. I have been kinda bottld up lately.  E-out.

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!! I saw that commercial earlier today and was 
gonna make a comment on it. That was some funee shit... the other one 
that kills me is the anti-pot commercial, where the kids dad is all like 
"don't smoke the wacky weed" and they cut to mom and she's wairin the 
yellow glasses and holding a disco ball and then they cut to some kid 
and he's all scratchin' and shit. I love that commercial, everytime i 
see it i just want to pull a tube....

well, i heard this song by robert miles called "children" a few years 
ago....i liked it alot, but i figured at the time that the whole album 
wasnt worth buying...but anyway, i just picked up the cd single of the 
song, and its absolutely fabulous.....i just wanna know what style it is 
considered, and what other people put out music like it...its a very 
nice emotional song..

Hey ne1 goin to Chicago for Psychosis.  Since thee occurance of Dj
confuscious' tragic accident I had to make alternate plans.  Oh well, at least
I will get to see Misjah again.   Does ne1 know where Confuscious is
hospitalized at.  I would like to send him a get well card or sumthin.  We
should write out a get well message to him and send it to him.  If someone
will send me info on where to send stuff to I will compile everybodies
messages and send it to him.  Somebody out there let me know how I can do
this.  Ne1 that wants to have a message sent to him send it to me and I will
make a card and hopefully someone will hook me up with an addy.  Maybe I could
send him some ballons with rabbits on it or sumthin.  Peace  E-out

I just recently moved from western PA back in with my parents, temporarily,
in western NY.  I haven't been to a party in a while and would love to
check out the Buffalo scene, but right now I don't have access to a car.
Is anyone going to Lift tomorrow who would be able to give me a ride?  I
live in a small town called Randolph, which is just a little east of
Jamestown, NY.  If it is not too far out of your way and you are able to
give me a "Lift" (get it?), could you please e-mail me back or call me at
(716)358-4871?
                                 Thanks,

	Hey it's Matt Cohen! Ladies and gentlemen, Pittsburgh's

	Just one question Matt, why are you so lame?

	You moved away, now all you have to do is find a place where

	I thought the Method show was great.  From what I gathered from the show in
PA, I expected it to be a not so good show.  At first I was shy to dance, but
after about 3 songs of Lunatic Calm, I danced all night.  The sound was phat
as hell!  Great acoustics at the Agora.  Besides the fact that the Agora is a
more or less dirty place, it was a great venue.  The vibe was sweet!  I did
have one girl call me a fucker bceause I didnt move at mach 10 to get out of
the way, but I kindly smiled and said have a good night.  But I swear I bumped
into about 10 people, and they all smiled, and said "whats up" in a friendly
way, or said "its cool".  I dont know if that show counts as a rave, but it
was my first, and I totaly enjoyed every second of it!  This is also my first
review on a show, and it is short, but I hope it was good.  :)  Anybody know a
girl by the name of Blair Johnson?  Anyways...take care, and hope to meet you
at upcoming raves.  

Hugh

i totally agree, it was a fun show.  i had some ish with the opening acts though--lunatic calm seemed like they were just playing a DAT tape with their drummer, and i couldn't figure out what the hell dj taylor was doing--can anyone enlighten me?  he changed records about three times during his whole set, but he was also using cd players and maybe a sequencer???  i dunno.  but crystal rocked the house, their lighting was insane, the new material sounded great, and they played around with the songs from vegas enough to make it interesting.  the crowd was dope!  very assorted mix of people but the vibe was good .. i wouldn't say it counts as a rave, my man, but it was a good concert.  and i got a crystal method glowstick! (which i'm still trying to decide if i'm embarassed to own :P)
peace,

the CWRU Rave Team was a joke (hossam was a part of it too)
it was a take off of the US Rave Team t-shirts that Strobe from
pittsburgh did back in the day circa '92-'93

just like the Tidal Rave flyer (the first rave in cleveland in '92)
was a parody of a Tide box...just like Powerave (the first rave in
pittsburgh) was a parody off a gatorade bottle

it all started as a joke...alotta kids havin fun...but when more
people started comin in, things started gettin serious...more
money, more problems...alotta of the new kids simply did not
understand, which was part of the reason i started PLRM to
inform the kids...

since i was in it since day one, i knew most of the kids who
were throwing the partys, but rather sticking with one cru,
i chose not to clique myself and helped promote for just about
all the crus: from Ultraworld to EPT to UPS to Ele Mental to 
Spawntaneous to Collective Intelligence to Battered Armadillo
to Untranslatable to even Sunshine Kids...there's prolly over
fifty crus i have helped promote for by now

after finally graduating from Case last year i moved to Columbus
for a change of scenery, for something that happened in the past,
and to be closer to my now ex-girl friend...after we broke up things 
have been awful for me...u can not imagine how difficult it so to move 
into a new city where u hardly know anybody and you hardly know 
where any thing is

and even worse perhaps out of fear that i would be competition
there were alot of wack rumors that were started about me down
here: everything from questioning my sexual preference, that i
was an undercover agent, that i had left cleveland cuz i was a gangsta 
seein what kinda dough i can make in cow town...and often i would play
it up, as a joke, not believing some kids were so gullible that they
would actually believe these ridiculous rumors...

perhaps it's time to kick the shade square in the nuts...

let there be light...

---------( begin last letter to all those involved w/ PLRM '94-'95)------

To the members of the Family of Light:

=09Well since you were all in some way involved with my magazine. I felt
that it was time I told you the truth behind PLRM.  I am going to tell you=
 
everything.  and I do mean everything. Prepare yourself, it's long, but al=
l
very
important.  Please read it all & reply back to me via e-mail when you are 
finished.


THE TRUTH BEHIND PLRM


HOW I GOT INTO THE SCENE

I started my alternative nature when my parents sent me to boarding school
- Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio.  After a few hazing incidents, =
it
became abundantly obvious that I could not be accepted like the other kids=
 
there.  It was another 'socially unacceptable' student there by the name o=
f 
Edward Enrique that introduced me to the alternative sounds of the then
cutting
edge music of: Depeche Mode, Tears for Fears, and New Order.  When I 
graduated in '88, my parents moved to California.  My exposure to the west=
 
coast greatly influenced my style not only in music but also in fashion an=
d 
choice of recreation: attending as many alternative music concerts as
possible.

I attended Case Western Reserve University. I soon became a club kid in
Cleveland.  By junior year I was helping out at the college radio station =
-
WRUW 91.1 FM.  My mentor on the air, was Steve St. James, who I had met 
through my clubbing days mostly at the Smart Bar (now the Whiskey) and
Metropolis (now Trilogy).  We got alot of kids into the scene by giving aw=
ay 
free passes to those clubs on the air.  It was Mr. St. James along with my=
self
and fellow WRUW techno DJ's: Marla and Sam and Club Kids: Fumi and Totts
that threw one of Cleveland's first Underground House partys at his apartm=
ent
on 1961 Ford Ave on the Case campus in July of 1991.  The party featured t=
he
first live performance of Lucky Charm aka Dan Curtin.  Dan would later sta=
rt
up his own record lable: Metamorphic (one of the first groups to be signed=
 to
this
lable was Body Release aka Todd Sines, Titonton Duvante, and Charles Noel =
-
the founding fathers of Ele Mental). Dan would also later join up with Tot=
ts
and one Steven Cinch to start their own record store: Deep Records (It was
also
this trio that reintroduced the rave scene to Cleveland by throwing Rebirt=
h in
'93).   

It was fellow WRUW DJ Lars Fischer from Germany who introduced me to techn=
o
and trance sounds that was being produced over the seas ( altho I was
already into industrial dance music then).  I also pulled a few local
underground
dj's illegally on the air (including Alex aka Tik Tak, Jesse aka Darwin, a=
nd
Mike
Filly) & even promoted raves like Ultraworld partys on the air.  By March =
of
'92,
we were planning on throwing the first rave in Cleveland, which was to be =
held
on the Case campus on my 22nd B-Day on March 20th 1992.  Due to 
unavoidable circumstances, the rave had to be canceled.

3 months later one of the dj's who was supposed to spin at my party - Mike
Filly (a college radio dj at John Carrol) teamed up with Rob Sherwood  (a =
club
dj) to throw the first official rave in Cleveland - Tidal Rave in June of =
'92.
I
helped promo the party along with the many other partys that followed it o=
n
the air on college radio.

That whole summer I was heavy on the Cleveland club & rave scene. 
That year while attending CWRU, I also started up the CWRU Billiard 
Club, because I also had a knack for shooting pool - another branch of my
alternative nature.  It was thru the CWRU Billiard Club that I developed
the leadership skills to start up another more important organization.

Summer of '93 - same thing, heavy on the club & rave scene. I even 
hooked up with Nivek Tek of Unique magazine. together we interviewed 
many live techno acts that hit Cleveland, including: Sunscreem, Cajmere, &=
 
Alpha Team. At one point we were even chosen to help cast for the 
extras in the club scene for the movie Double Dragon that was being 
filmed in Cleveland that summer. I even modeled in the Unique Party 
that introduced Unique Magazine to Cleveland.


THE BIRTH OF PLRM

October of '93 I started up the CWRU Rave Team for those interested in the=
 
rave scene @ CWRU. soon interest grew off campus and the name needed to be
changed. I was unsure what to change it to 'til I spotted Lisa Lee dancing=
 at 
some party out east. I don't recall it too well because I was all wacked o=
ut 
on drugs at the party. But I do recall seeing her dance & coming out mumbl=
ing:
'wow, what a pretty little rave machine'. Thats when the CWRU Rave Team
became Pretty Little Rave Machine.

By '94 most of the members of Pretty Little Rave Machine graduated &
moved on w/ their lives. so I wanted to start up a newsletter to inform 
everybody about what was going on. That's when PLRM was concieved. 

Alot happened between '94 and '95 because I had to drop out of a college 
with a semester left because I was low on funds. so I got heavy into the r=
ave
scene. I think a major party for me in '94 was Ultraworld's Emerald Forest=
.
not only was that one of the largest partys i've ever been to, but it show=
ed
me just how powerful a rave can be. That was also the night I first bumped
into Heath of the Superstars of Love on the streets of Baltimore by Modern
Music.


RONNIE, TREVOR, & MARY ENTERS THE PICTURE

Somehow I hooked up with Ronnie who was from the North Carolina
scene. anyways he moved in with me. he had thrown one of the earliest
parties in North Carolina - Raindance. because of that he knew quite a few
people in the scene including Josh Wink & Trevor Lamont. that was also 
when I first started getting on the net. I first talked to Trevor off of 
prodigy. Ronnie had known him from throwing his party. and had asked 
him to put us on the guest list for 'Biosphere' this party in Columbus tha=
t 
he was spinning at.

So we go to this party in Columbus.  This was the first time I met Mary 
because she was working the door. I thought she was pretty nice cuz she le=
t us
in the party for free cuz we knew Trevor. later on Mary would become 
very important.

At the party, Ronnie asked to borrow $50 from me to pay back Josh Wink sin=
ce
he owed him money for his last party. it ended up he used all the money fo=
r
drugs. I guess he did five hits of acid and some other stuff that night. W=
ell 
our ride specifically said she would not give him a ride back, if he got t=
oo
fucked up. Ronnie mentioned that this other girl Terri could take him back=
.


MY RELATIONSHIP WITH TERRI

So the next day, Terri calls & says she had left him at the party because =
he 
was too fucked up. so nobody knew where Ronnie was. a few days later I get
this call. its collect from Ronnie. it turned out after the party, Ronnie =
was
walking thru the woods. he tried killing himself by jumping  off a bridge =
& 
he woke up in the cuyahoga river. and he was currently in a Columbus rehab
center. eventually the rehab had to return him to North Carolina. where th=
ere
was a warrent for his arrest. he gets charged & he is put in Texas juvi
because
there's no jail in North Carolina for juviniles (atleast that is what he
said).

Through talking so much with Terri on the phone & on the net about Ronnie,
we got to know each other pretty well.  Ironically, out of all this, we
started
dating.      

A few months later the previous roommate of the room I was staying in was
returning & I had to find a new place to live. so I asked Terri to be my
roommate. She said sure as long as her friend amy can move in with us. 
I said fine so we all moved in this apartment.

Eventually due to unavoidable problems, Terri had to move out. So it becam=
e
just me & Amy living in the apartment. 


MY DRUG DEALING ROOMMATES

Then this kid Chris entered the picture. Well Chris was a drug dealer.
One night he gave Amy her first hit. Well she really freaked out & she dia=
led 
911 on herself. So her parents found out & she had to move out. so I had t=
o
find 
new roommates. well it turned out Chris needed a place. so I let him move =
in.
He had a friend Tim, who just got out of a mental hospital and he
needed a place to stay and being the nice guy I was, I let him stay too. 

Eventually I picked up a fourth roommate - Mike Fifer. I bumped into Mike
coincidentally while going to a record store to visit my old friend Nivek,
who 
I used to work with for Unique Magazine. well anyways he was throwing this
party - Utopia.  and had put so much money into the party that he couldn't=
 
afford rent. well we all went out to eat & over dinner I said he could mov=
e in
with me if he really needed a place. well he did & he was the fourth & onl=
y
decent roommate I had. mostly because he had a steady job. didn't deal dru=
gs.
and didn't steal from me. 

It was Mike who set up that meeting for all the Cleveland promotors from 
which Family Affair was conceived. But it was Brian of UPS that eventually
threw the party. That was the party I promoted pretty hard for on the net.
Coincidentally there was more out of town kids than in town kids at that
party. that was also the biggest & highest vibed party that had ever happe=
ned
in Ohio. and it was the party that Spike, Chris Green, Taj, Adam Darby & t=
he
rest of the
Cybertribe Crew pretty much got together. This wuz also where many ravers
learned about 'PLUR' for the first time. becuz it was at Family Affair tha=
t I 
passed out the PLRM with the interview of Lonnie & featured the article ab=
out 
the significance of 'PLUR' to the entire rave scene. The article was writt=
en
by 
Ecto from Montreal Canada. It was ecto, spike, & myself that would start u=
p
the
'PLUR' revival on NE-Raves. Kids also got to see 'PLUR' in action for the
first time 
at FA when I helped Adam find his lost wallet, my friends & I started the =
fire
in 
the back when it got too cold that last night, & when I drove a few strand=
ed 
kids home after the party. I even drove Joeski to the airport.


LOVEBOMB

Before Mike moved in & before even Terri moved out. there was
Trevor's party - LOVEBOMB. At first it was scheduled for Dec. 17th I belie=
ve.
then Lonnie scheduled his party for the same date. In fact I was the one t=
hat
informed Lonnie on the net that he had scheduled his party the same night =
as
Trevor's. but what happened was Trevor just moved his party to a later dat=
e -
which just so happened to be national hug day. Well I had mentioned earlie=
r
that I was going to do a road trip for it from Cleveland. But when Terri &=
 I
got on bad terms, she hooked up with Rick aka Dreamer & pulled some of the
people that was supposed to go with me to go with Rick. so I had to find s=
ome
new people, which I did. later before I left the party I told Rick, that w=
e 
used to work together, and we shouldn't compete with each other now. 
but I realized it wasn't his fault it was all Terri's evil doings.  LOVEBO=
MB 
was a very important party because that was the 2nd time I bumped into 
Mary & the Columbus crew including one of the girls who would later pass 
on.  we were all on e that night. that was also the night I put out the PL=
RM 
with Lisa Lee on the front cover & the interview of Trevor & Scott Forbush=
 
in it. that was the night I 1st met many of the Superstars & the Zenith cr=
ew 
thru Trevor & Pattie from Medina.


HEARTLAND, MUSIC, IMAGINE, THE FOUR GIRLS FROM COLUMBUS

The next important party was HEARTLAND in Indianapolis. It was a total flu=
ke
how I got out there. Basically I called this guy who I had just met if he
wanted to go. It just so happened they were looking for something to do. s=
o
we went. This was the third time I bumped into Mary. She & Yoshi sported
me alot of meth that night. That night four kids from Kentucky passed away=
 
on their way back home.

The next important party was the weekend of MUSIC & IMAGINE. The night
of MUSIC I was really depressed because someone had ruined my night. That
night some kid od'ed on heroin. Mary had given me her number @ Heartland,
so I called her & told her about how depressed I was. So the night of IMAG=
INE
she, Tony, & Yoshi came up to keep my spirits up. on the way to the party,=
 we 
barely avoid a head on collision with this guy who swerved into our lane. =
I 
think we were s'posed to die that night. but I moved out of the way in tim=
e & 
we lived - me in my car with Dana. and Mary in her car with Tony & Yoshi. =
it 
turned out that night at about the same time. four girls from Columbus on
their
way up to the party: Christina Mazetelli, Miriam Flores, Elizabeth Dancey,=
 &
Natalie Harris blew out a tire & went straight into a mac truck. They were
killed
instantly.  Also on the way back from the afterhours. I almost fell asleep=
 at
the 
wheel but luckily I was pulled over for speeding. again I should've died.

That whole week everybody from Columbus was all very sad. Also that week
something very bizarre happened. The EPT house burnt to the ground. Alot o=
f
rave kids were living in it. No one one was killed, but everyone knew ther=
e
was
alot of drugs going on in that house.

So there was this combination mourning party for the four girls & EPT kids
party in columbus. I went down by myself to Columbus to be there for Mary
because she was there for me.. That night Mary mentioned that sometimes sh=
e
could still feel their presence. That night a bunch of us including Bobby =
&
Carol slept over at Mary & Shannon's apartment.  we woke up in the evening=
.


THE MESSAGE & THE SIGNS - ARE YOU READY?

That night was also the night of one of the first Ele Mental party in Colu=
mbus
-
Minimal State, which was also dedicated to those four girls. That night I
admit 
I was rollin that night, but I had the strongest inclination that those fo=
ur
girls
were trying to tell me something.  I walked from room to room trying to ge=
t 
away from their voices. It became obvious that some one upstairs was not
happy.
Then it all clicked:

the 1st sign - how Chinagrrrl from Akron had od'ed on heroin but was 
                      brought back to life at Interstellar Outback in
Kentucky. 

the 2nd sign - four kids from Kentucky were killed on their way home 
                       when they fell asleep at the wheel from Heartland.

the 3rd sign -  one kid od'ed on heroin the night of MUSIC in Akron.

the 4th sign -  the four girls from Columbus that passed the night of 
                       IMAGINE from a bizarre car accident.  and how I 
                       coincidentally almost got into a head on collision
before
                       IMAGINE. and how I almost  fell asleep behind the w=
heel
                       after IMAGINE in Cleveland.

the 5th sign - the EPT house in Akron burnt down.

I didn't understand. how were we supposed to change? Or could we change
things? I really did not want to tell Mary that her dead friends were talk=
ing
to me. But I knew I had to. So finally I told her.  I was unsure why I had=
 to
tell her all this. or even why it was even me. but  I think I just freaked=
 her
out more than anything else when I did.  The whole time at the afterhours =
of 
that party as I waited for Mary. I sat on a couch staring at the ceiling
trying 
to figure out what was told to me & thinking how I was supposed to change 
things. I really didn't know what I was supposed to do. Finally when Mary
came, she asked me:  are you ready?  I'm not sure why, but I retorted: are=
 you
ready?

MARY & I

Back at her place she asked alot of questions. like whether or not I was a
narc. Of course I wasn't.  She asked if I had seen the four girls. I said =
no,
I 
only heard them. she asked whether this had ever happened to me before. I 
said no.  We were both very tired after the party so we both crashed
after showering.

When I got up the next day, I told her I had to get going back to Clevelan=
d.  
But I had to talk to her in private first.  In her room I told her I meant
what I 
had said. and I felt very strongly toward the four girls in fact I wanted =
to
visit
their place of rest. but she wouldn't tell me where they were buried. she =
said
I
was probably hallucinating from the drugs. I told her I know when I am
hallucinating. plus i've never hallucinated on e before. she sed she had. =
In
fact 
she hallucinated that night about happy stuff -- bunnys. Then she sed she
didn't 
think she could change. I told her: you do what you've got to do, but I fe=
lt
very 
strongly about this &  I was going to change.

I wanted to stay with her very badly & to help her. But I knew there was 
nothing more I could do. If she was to change it would have to be on her o=
wn 
free will.


THINGS CHANGED

Later on I found out my drug dealer roommates were stealing alot of my stu=
ff
including a $500 check that was my birthday gift & to help cover the rent
they couldn't. I knew then & there I had to move out of that place, which =
I
did within a week with the help of a few of my few close friends. My drug
dealer roommates got away with about $1000 worth of my stuff including
that check though. they are both currently at large. Chris for scamming 
some guy for $2000. he sold him undipped sheets & left town. rumor is he's
fled to Boston. Tim gave himself in after he robbed a few houses around
christmas time last year. The cops were gonna nab him anyways. He is
currently out on parol. I never narced on them eventho they had abused
me so badly.

I am not religious, but I prayed to those four girls that I would do my be=
st 
to change things, although I was unsure how.

The next important party was NO SHIT! the first Spawntaneous party.
That night was kind of a sad night also because Jinx's friend had
just past away. I guess you can say that was the 6th & last sign. That nig=
ht 
Mary was there but I tried avoiding her because I thought she didn't want 
to see me. She walked up to me & gave me a big hug. she then explained 
what had happened to her. alot of her stuff was getting stolen at her 
apartment. And she had to move back with her mom. She appeared very 
sad. But she said she had quit dealing.                     


THE CELESTINE PROPHECY

Later on Mary threw that big party ONE in Columbus.  The party should've
broke even at the very least. But somehow she lost.  And as a result she w=
as 
not able to pay her friend - Amy, DJ Siren back for helping fund that part=
y. I
went up early to help mary set up for that party. 

Mary would later throw ULTRAVIOLET & MOON DROP. But I didn't really 
get to know her better 'til the MOBY concert here in Cleveland. I  drove 
all the way down to Columbus to pick her up for it. We arrived late for th=
e 
concert. but that didn't matter what mattered was the long drive we had 
to find out more about each other. it turned out we were both recommended 
the CELESTINE PROPHECY at about the same time, right before her party ONE.
the book had really opened up our eyes about alot of things. Especially wi=
th 
all the coincidences & chance meetings we've had in the past couple of mon=
ths.
she also told me that she was in the Navy. And she told me her two previou=
s
boy friends both died of mysterious causes. I told her about my bad
relationships. 


A HIGHER STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

Then just recently something dawned on me...like in the CELESTINE
PROPHECY, I noticed how all of my meetings for the interviews in my
magazine were strangely coincidental, but each person had an important 
message:

* the December issue:  the guy from FOX TV, basically he just totally out
   of the blue called me up because they responded to random e-mail letter=
s. 
   the main point with him was how TV stereotyped ravers as druggies.

* the January issue: Trevor Lamont, I met him thru a bunch of bizarre
   coincidences, thru Ronnie who was actually from North Carolina but
   ended up staying with me.  His message was: "promotors are goin to have=
 to 
   legalize the events, make sure they have all the permits secure & make
   the events as drug free as they can or not do it. Rather than trying to=
 
   make a quick buck with the renegade parties." because if something
   happened at one of their parties, someone got hurt, they would be
   held liable.

* February issue: Mike Filly, met him thru college radio. his main 
  message: " I never had a chance to settle down & get with a group from
  one area, so I just knew all these dudes from different areas. and all
  these kids i'd meet were like hoods...but I wasn't a hood, I was just a
  clown, I was just silly. I was never out causing trouble, breaking laws,
  drugs, I never touched any of that stuff in high school." 

* March/April issue:  Dave Trance was another chance meeting interview. 
  he just happened to be at deep records that day. his main message:
  "the reason that all of us got into the scene in the first place was bec=
ause
  we all came from different backgrounds & we could still have fun. but 
  now you have this; 'look at that guy, what's he doing here?' when in rea=
lity
  the whole scene is about not being about that." 

* May/June issue: Carlos - he just happened to be spinning at this EPT 
   party. his main message: "one thing I really want to say is that its   =
  
   everybodys responsiblity to throw partys that make people be better   
   people. because thats the whole idea of doing these kind of parties. it=
s 
   like to educate the kids about being nicer. like the whole problem with=
 the
   gang thing in California, I know alot of guys who used to be gangsters =
& 
   they go to a party, get some e, & they become better people & they lead=
 
   the gangs. they sort of evolve to a higher level. and that=92s the whol=
e idea
   of doing these kind of parties..the drugs are fun but you have to take =
it 
   to another level..not go to parties for the drugs, but to become better=
 
   people."

* July issue:  Lonnie - I went to TUNNELVISION & joe 187 introduced me to
  him. I interviewed Joe thru a chance meeting - he just showed up at an
  ohio party & I was like i've gotta interview you. Lonnie's  main message=
 was
  how he hated crystal meth (which is why he gave this speech against it a=
t
one
  of his private partys) & how it was the media's fault for stereotyping 
  raves as places to go for drugs & that's why the dealers came in. 

* August/September issue: JJ - basically I bumped into him at ONE, Mary's
   party. He just happened to be there & we met. his main message: ravers 
   are pattern freaks & tend to be neophiles. but as with all things we ha=
ve 
   to learn to adapt. but the first place you have to start is within
yourself. Also
   in that issue:  Chinagrrrl - basically she introduced herself to me off=
 
   the net.  But it was Dan the man spam who brought me to her in real lif=
e. 
   her obvious message: drug deaths are real, i'm living proof. I was just=
 
   lucky enuff to live to tell you about it.  She also gave us a glimpse o=
f
the 
   afterlife.

* October/November issue: Chip from Eyegasm - basically he just called me 
   up & said you should interview someone from the technical side of the
scene. 
   so I interviewed him. his main message: "its a good feeling to know you=
 
   have some power & control it, but I try to do it positively so that we =
can 
   take people somewhere & bring them back & make them better to deal 
   with their everyday lives. but any good thing can be abused too much. 
   take it from one whose worked lights for thousands of nights. it can ta=
ke 
    it's toll on you. too much partying can be bad too. party hard, but pa=
rty 
    wisely.'

* December/January issue: Chris & Alex of Spawntaneous - they were at that
   party SANCTUARY in Cleveland. and I interviewed them. Chris pointed out=
 
   that something was definitely wrong with our system. Alex just so     
   happened to be another person who od'ed & lived to tell about it. 
   and the interview with Ian, he pointed out how technology is moving fas=
ter 
   because  information can be transered faster via the internet. His mess=
age:
   "its a very delicate time in human history & what we're doing as the 
   underground scene along with those connected by the internet with all t=
his 
   information, is trying to up the people to a higher level of thinking t=
hen 
   what you're used to". 

So in a nutshell I finally figured it out that I was supposed to change th=
ings
through my magazine.  I was s'posed to inject a higher state of consciousn=
ess
into the underground by bringing those with important messages into the li=
ght.

My only question now is after a year of struggling with this magazine & lo=
sing
tons of money (since most of the money for everything comes out of my own
pocket) have I fulfilled my destiny? have I done enuff? have I kept my pro=
mise
to those four girls & the rest that had to die for me to see the light?

   Thanks for wishing me luck, S.F. is great, keep pretending that you aren't insignificant, and bugging
promoters until they book your sorry ass and everything
will be just great!

Forever on the watch for a brilliant public service announcement, I just
saw one.  It was so great that I got out of bed and turned on my computer
to write this post even though I just got home from a really skeevy rave
that I won't bother to review because it's out of the region.

Anyway, it started with this totally pierced and tatooed kids walking
(indiviually) through this park.  A young male voice with an urban accent
narrated.  He said something along the lines of: drug dealers are in these
parks, gangsters are in these parks, thieves are in these parks, and so
on and so forth.  He's narrating this things while different, really iffy
looking kids walk on the screen.  Then he says something about not judging
teens by their outward appearances rather than their actions.  Then he
says something about getting involved with the community and the
screen shows a phone number.  I thought it was a pretty spiffy psa.  I
still like the meth-jingle psa and the new-take-on-This is your brain on
drugs psa.

Ditto.  Most fulfilling party I've had in
a while, if not the most!

I got there by myself, and knew no one.
(My friends didn't show.)
However, I left with 9 phone numbers and
many more friendships.
I almost died because Ken's set was so hard!
What the hell was that?  IT RULED!!!

Well, I can't feel my legs= good party!

Hi all:

I just got back from the LIFT venue and being the promoter I feel everyone
deserves the bottom line on why LIFT got shut down at 6am.  I was alerted by
the building owner that due to a house robbery on next street, we were going
to be raided since they felt it was influenced by our event.  That compounded
with lots of noise complaints had me worried.  I was told that the police both
Buffalo and Kenmore were on their way over in force.  Now since we were
serving alcohol and it was crowded.  I felt it best we break the party then
instead of having it raided, which would have caused people to get searched
and of course seeing anyone who looked suspect to be detained and possibly
busted.  I right away put the word out to the crew and then went outside to
see about 6-8 police cars.  I approached the police captain and he told me he
was called by the owner to come out and both enforce traffic since the arty
was ending.  Now the owner was in the lot all night charging admission, $5.00,
which I am glad most people opted to just say no and walk a few yards and park
elsewhere.  I confronted the owner and he denied it.  I also was informed that
another police officer which did not like the building owner said they were
called by the owner to shut down the party since he has had his fun and wanted
it to end.  Now at this point I was very pissed and of course I lost it.  I
re-approached the police and they said they had no intention of shutting our
event down, and even went to comment of how well run it was, with no problems.
So then I hear from the building owner that he was questioned on serving
alcohol without a permit and to minors.  So I once again confronted the police
captain and he said no that was not a problem at all, since no one leaving the
lot looked out of it.  Midway through this I ran back into the venue to
reverse my actions but it was already to late to stop things.  I ran into this
pushy girl called Suzette or something who wouldn't stop talking to me.  I
think she does something at Marcella's.  Finally, since she noticed I was
bothered and very rushed and not in the mood for small talk at that point,
which was not even invited by me, she tells me she just wanted to put
"sunshine in my cloudy day."  Well, of course I just had to laugh but I told
her to get out of my face I was busy.  So she spits on me, and of course she
was carried out by an off-duty cop, kicking and screaming saying she knew the
owners, which she doesn't or should I say I found out really can't stand her
and think she is a freak.  Sorry for the segway but what is it with the lack
of people skills just amazes me, I mean I'm in the middle of a crisis and she
wants to chit chat.  My God.  I think I must have gave her 4,000 body language
cues to leave me alone then.

Okay back to the event.  As you know I later had it out with the owner and it
got ugly.  The story kept changing and I knew some of it was BS but what the
hell am I to do now, the lights are on and the DJ's have stopped.  Vibe
killed.  Here is what I think really happened.  Yes, there was noise
complaints but they were bogus, yes there was a house break-in but the other
stuff was BS.  At the start of this police crap there were over 1,700 people
in the venue and it was getting crazy.  Not to say the drunk fuckin meatheads
that were guests of the owner and person who ran the bar.  I mean I knew some
of these people and they are cool but when they get drunk they slip down a few
notches on the evolutionary ladder and it gets ugly.  I saw some ravers
getting skittish about this.  Well, I think the building owner was going "oh
my God, this is getting intense" and I think he panicked.  I understand the
position since it was getting real crowded.

Well, on the plus side, everyone had a great time, the DJ's loved the place,
partied and had a blast (WNY got a great rep out of it) and it went off with
no injuries and problems, aside from shutting down.  My point is I apologize
for my actions but I did what I felt was right from being told with the
alcohol and people partying in the venue.  If I was lied to or put in the
middle of a sham, I guess we will never know for sure but I do know one thing
I didn't buy a lot of it I heard but I had no other options at hand
considering things with everyone inside.  Offworld lost a little bit of money
but everyone was paid and its not going to stop us.  Our next event will be
run a lot differently and we took a lot of things to heart and consideration
next time.

Once again thanks to all for your great props and I felt the outcome needed an
explanation.

first of all... the fwd: message I sent was from the Promoter... not me
this is for NE-raves and pb-cle-raves  people.... 
I was just one of the DJ's


OK.. well first of all... VERY nice Venue... a Warehouse ... 2 rooms perfect
size
for the main and for second room.... it did get hot... but the promoter set up
many large fans inside the area... it still got hot,,,, but it could have been
MUCH worse..

Speaking as a DJ who spun there... The system was a Very nice one
DJ area had 2 good loud monitors (hint to other promoters) the mixer mas a
Rane mojo series... nice mixer.... separate EQ's for each channel... could
have had a gain but that's ok....  Lights were very nicely done.

my spot was 10:30 - 11:30  :-(

not a great time slot... however I'm not gonna complain much since at least
the promoter booked me in Buffalo  (very rare for me to get booked in
Buffalo.... guess the other promoters don't like me,,,, oh well)

The VIP room was very cool.... INDIAN CATERED FOOD... yummy...
free water / soda / liquor / beer    COLD by the way...   (not the food the
drinks..)  :-)

There were so many FREE things for everybody...

CD-rom software like the re-birth.... and other things...
stickers from nervous
FREE URB MAGAZINE's
tapes / CD's / Vinyl
Candy

for the Ravers--  SODA / WATER = $1 a can / bottle...  YES  $1
XTC drinks  were $2  and that's still a good price.. 'cause those drinks are
expensive

there was a samll out door patio w/  port-a-poties  about 3 or 4 of them

as far as DJ's go.... Marty was great as always... if you like Breaks he's da
man
I enjoyed my set....  was dancing my booty ... I had a couple of off mixes..
oh well.
Heather Heart... was VERY boring to me... for the time slot she had... YUCK
Neil Landstrum -  He's probably a great producer.... but just 'cause somebody
is a great producer... it does not make them a good DJ - nuff said

that's all I can say... I really was noty listening to the other room
I heard a few of the Jungle traxxx but I have to hear a whole set to critique
it,,
I was enjoying what I heard.... 

All and all ... this was a VERY professional job the Venue was nice the
Tickets were very cool.... Security was cool... I did not see flashlights in
face action happening.

$5 parking is weird... but people who want to park and not worry abnout
walking far.. then it's all good... 

I'll pay $5 for parking before paying $30 for bunk E ... at least I know what
I'm getting for $5 ... he he he

Anyway all in all I had a good time.. and I was very impressed at the show of
people for this party... VERY GOOD JOB to OFFWORLD productions

NEXT time you see an OFF world production flyer .... think VERY seriously
about going... it will probably be a very positive move on your side....
this is their 1st party.... they only get better from here.....
and let me tell yuz.... this was an excellent party

Did anyone else get to catch that movie TT aka. "PI", 
playing at the Squirrel Hill Theatre?

I bring it up on here for one, because it had a pretty interesting 
soundtrack, including some stuff by autechre, aphex, roni size (mixed by
ed rush, weird or what?).   In fact the soundtrack is 100% electronic, or
very close to it.  Oddly enough I only really noticed 2-3 different
musical themes/pieces during the whole movie.  Probably another one of
those, 'its on the soundtrack, but not in the movie' things.

Anyway, when i heard the idea of the movie it sounded wicked - its about
this obsessed and paranoid numerical theorist who's working on finding
some universal mathematical pattern to predict everything. 
 
After seeing the flick though, I was a bit dissappointed.  The visuals -
black and white, high contrast, film style and atmosphere are aweseome and
worth seeing just for them alone.  Check the use of 5 1/2" disks for a
chuckle.
 
But the plot is pretty light in terms of hardcore mystical math theories.
There's a couple nice samplable lines, but not as many as you'd think for
a movie where 50% of the dialog has to do with math or god.  There's a few
really interesting plot elements, but overall they don't take any of them
far enough.

Still, its a movie alot of folks on here would probably enjoy, so check it
out if you were thinking about it, before its gone.

l8s,

If you were a DJ and had to choose between two events on the same
night for about the same pay, would you choose the one with a little
bit more fringe benefits? I see nothing wrong with treating djs well.

     um, well, another _phat_ little time down at metropol
     this thursday. shouts to kelly/downlow, spike, liquid,
     xspyboy, shade, jbrick (thanks for the ride), and of
     course andy the pooh.

     things that were wierd: the vibe. the crowd was pretty
     much the usual mixed bag, and down on the floor things
     got pretty confused on occasion. but moving up to the 
     second layer (on the floor) towards the end of the night
     dropped you into a puddle of sickeningly thick vibe that
     just had to get your feet off the ground. rava massiv yo.

     =]

     things that weren't wierd: heather heart's set. house,
     baby. [geekboy is immediately slain by pittsburgh 
     junglist massiv]. the plurry list-kids. my generally 
     jovial/bemused/wired state of mind.

     that's it, i guess. general verdict: more than satisfactory.
     more, please.

     tom, when you're a world-famous DJ with two
     ferarris, questionable mixing skills and a
     coke habit we'll remember that you don't like
     indian food in your VIP suite.

     =P

     when the blood sun sets behind the skeleton
     trees / the black rain cuts rivers in the

There's definitely something to say for giving "cool" DJs extra perks.  I
spent about $50 on fresh fruit and drinks for the guys at IGC and they were
so thankful.  I don't know if anyone noticed but all but one of the DJs hung
out for most of the night.  Not to mention that they go back to their agent
and fellow DJs in their cities and tell them what a blast they had in
Pittsburgh.  To me, that's success.  In return they've sent so many CDs,
tapes, t-shirts, and stickers (which we've been handing out at all the
parties).  What goes around...

Tom is easily irritated. :P

I hear you about VIP rooms...they seem kinda iffy to me.  But, it sounds
like Lift had alot of perks for the participants, so it doesn't seem
irrelevant to give the djs something nice too.  Personally, I'd like
to have a happy friendly atmosphere for the ravers and the performers,
treat them like friends - so if my friends are doing something for me like
performing at my event, 50-100 of food is pretty minor in the whole scheme
of things.  If they're getting steaks and caviar thats something else, but
indian food is pretty cheap.  (well..cheap where i get it, and damn good
too!)  I know you'd rather have a happy friendly dj than a dj who's just
going through the motions, right tom?

> HOW I GOT INTO THE SCENE
>
> I started my alternative nature when my parents sent me to boarding school

> possible.
>
> I attended Case Western Reserve University. I soon became a club kid in
> Cleveland.  By junior year I was helping out at the college radio station -
> WRUW 91.1 FM.  My mentor on the air, was Steve St. James, who I had met
> through my clubbing days mostly at the Smart Bar (now the Whiskey) and
> Metropolis (now Trilogy).  We got alot of kids into the scene by giving away
> free passes to those clubs on the air.  It was Mr. St. James along with myself
> and fellow WRUW techno DJ's: Marla and Sam and Club Kids: Fumi and Totts
> that threw one of Cleveland's first Underground House partys at his apartment
> on 1961 Ford Ave on the Case campus in July of 1991.  The party featured the
> first live performance of Lucky Charm aka Dan Curtin.  Dan would later start
> up his own record lable: Metamorphic (one of the first groups to be signed to
> this
> lable was Body Release aka Todd Sines, Titonton Duvante, and Charles Noel -
> the founding fathers of Ele Mental). Dan would also later join up with Totts
> and one Steven Cinch to start their own record store: Deep Records (It was
> also
> this trio that reintroduced the rave scene to Cleveland by throwing Rebirth in
> '93).
>
> It was fellow WRUW DJ Lars Fischer from Germany who introduced me to techno
> and trance sounds that was being produced over the seas ( altho I was
> already into industrial dance music then).  I also pulled a few local
> underground
> dj's illegally on the air (including Alex aka Tik Tak, Jesse aka Darwin, and
> Mike
> Filly) & even promoted raves like Ultraworld partys on the air.  By March of
> '92,
> we were planning on throwing the first rave in Cleveland, which was to be held
> on the Case campus on my 22nd B-Day on March 20th 1992.  Due to

>
> 3 months later one of the dj's who was supposed to spin at my party - Mike
> Filly (a college radio dj at John Carrol) teamed up with Rob Sherwood  (a club
> dj) to throw the first official rave in Cleveland - Tidal Rave in June of '92.
> I

>
> That whole summer I was heavy on the Cleveland club & rave scene.
> That year while attending CWRU, I also started up the CWRU Billiard

>
> Summer of '93 - same thing, heavy on the club & rave scene. I even

> THE BIRTH OF PLRM
>
> October of '93 I started up the CWRU Rave Team for those interested in the
> rave scene @ CWRU. soon interest grew off campus and the name needed to be
> changed. I was unsure what to change it to 'til I spotted Lisa Lee dancing at
> some party out east. I don't recall it too well because I was all wacked out
> on drugs at the party. But I do recall seeing her dance & coming out mumbling:
> 'wow, what a pretty little rave machine'. Thats when the CWRU Rave Team
> became Pretty Little Rave Machine.
>
> By '94 most of the members of Pretty Little Rave Machine graduated &
> moved on w/ their lives. so I wanted to start up a newsletter to inform
> everybody about what was going on. That's when PLRM was concieved.
>
> Alot happened between '94 and '95 because I had to drop out of a college
> with a semester left because I was low on funds. so I got heavy into the rave
> scene. I think a major party for me in '94 was Ultraworld's Emerald Forest.
> not only was that one of the largest partys i've ever been to, but it showed
> me just how powerful a rave can be. That was also the night I first bumped

> RONNIE, TREVOR, & MARY ENTERS THE PICTURE
>
> Somehow I hooked up with Ronnie who was from the North Carolina
> scene. anyways he moved in with me. he had thrown one of the earliest
> parties in North Carolina - Raindance. because of that he knew quite a few
> people in the scene including Josh Wink & Trevor Lamont. that was also
> when I first started getting on the net. I first talked to Trevor off of
> prodigy. Ronnie had known him from throwing his party. and had asked
> him to put us on the guest list for 'Biosphere' this party in Columbus that
> he was spinning at.
>
> So we go to this party in Columbus.  This was the first time I met Mary
> because she was working the door. I thought she was pretty nice cuz she let us
> in the party for free cuz we knew Trevor. later on Mary would become
> very important.
>
> At the party, Ronnie asked to borrow $50 from me to pay back Josh Wink since
> he owed him money for his last party. it ended up he used all the money for
> drugs. I guess he did five hits of acid and some other stuff that night. Well
> our ride specifically said she would not give him a ride back, if he got too
> fucked up. Ronnie mentioned that this other girl Terri could take him back.
>
> MY RELATIONSHIP WITH TERRI
>
> So the next day, Terri calls & says she had left him at the party because he
> was too fucked up. so nobody knew where Ronnie was. a few days later I get
> this call. its collect from Ronnie. it turned out after the party, Ronnie was

>
> Through talking so much with Terri on the phone & on the net about Ronnie,

>
> A few months later the previous roommate of the room I was staying in was

> I said fine so we all moved in this apartment.
>
> Eventually due to unavoidable problems, Terri had to move out. So it became

>
> MY DRUG DEALING ROOMMATES
>
> Then this kid Chris entered the picture. Well Chris was a drug dealer.

> Eventually I picked up a fourth roommate - Mike Fifer. I bumped into Mike

>
> A HIGHER STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
>
> Then just recently something dawned on me...like in the CELESTINE
> PROPHECY, I noticed how all of my meetings for the interviews in my
> magazine were strangely coincidental, but each person had an important
> message:
>
> * the December issue:  the guy from FOX TV, basically he just totally out
>    of the blue called me up because they responded to random e-mail letters.
>    the main point with him was how TV stereotyped ravers as druggies.
>
> * the January issue: Trevor Lamont, I met him thru a bunch of bizarre
>    coincidences, thru Ronnie who was actually from North Carolina but
>    ended up staying with me.  His message was: "promotors are goin to have to
>    legalize the events, make sure they have all the permits secure & make
>    the events as drug free as they can or not do it. Rather than trying to
>    make a quick buck with the renegade parties." because if something
>    happened at one of their parties, someone got hurt, they would be
>    held liable.
>
> * February issue: Mike Filly, met him thru college radio. his main
>   message: " I never had a chance to settle down & get with a group from
>   one area, so I just knew all these dudes from different areas. and all
>   these kids i'd meet were like hoods...but I wasn't a hood, I was just a
>   clown, I was just silly. I was never out causing trouble, breaking laws,
>   drugs, I never touched any of that stuff in high school."
>
> * March/April issue:  Dave Trance was another chance meeting interview.
>   he just happened to be at deep records that day. his main message:
>   "the reason that all of us got into the scene in the first place was because
>   we all came from different backgrounds & we could still have fun. but
>   now you have this; 'look at that guy, what's he doing here?' when in reality
>   the whole scene is about not being about that."
>
> * May/June issue: Carlos - he just happened to be spinning at this EPT
>    party. his main message: "one thing I really want to say is that its
>    everybodys responsiblity to throw partys that make people be better
>    people. because thats the whole idea of doing these kind of parties. its
>    like to educate the kids about being nicer. like the whole problem with the
>    gang thing in California, I know alot of guys who used to be gangsters &
>    they go to a party, get some e, & they become better people & they lead
>    the gangs. they sort of evolve to a higher level. and thats the whole idea
>    of doing these kind of parties..the drugs are fun but you have to take it
>    to another level..not go to parties for the drugs, but to become better
>    people."
>
> * July issue:  Lonnie - I went to TUNNELVISION & joe 187 introduced me to
>   him. I interviewed Joe thru a chance meeting - he just showed up at an
>   ohio party & I was like i've gotta interview you. Lonnie's  main message was
>   how he hated crystal meth (which is why he gave this speech against it at
> one
>   of his private partys) & how it was the media's fault for stereotyping
>   raves as places to go for drugs & that's why the dealers came in.
>
> * August/September issue: JJ - basically I bumped into him at ONE, Mary's
>    party. He just happened to be there & we met. his main message: ravers
>    are pattern freaks & tend to be neophiles. but as with all things we have
>    to learn to adapt. but the first place you have to start is within
> yourself. Also
>    in that issue:  Chinagrrrl - basically she introduced herself to me off
>    the net.  But it was Dan the man spam who brought me to her in real life.
>    her obvious message: drug deaths are real, i'm living proof. I was just
>    lucky enuff to live to tell you about it.  She also gave us a glimpse of
> the
>    afterlife.
>
> * October/November issue: Chip from Eyegasm - basically he just called me
>    up & said you should interview someone from the technical side of the
> scene.
>    so I interviewed him. his main message: "its a good feeling to know you
>    have some power & control it, but I try to do it positively so that we can
>    take people somewhere & bring them back & make them better to deal
>    with their everyday lives. but any good thing can be abused too much.
>    take it from one whose worked lights for thousands of nights. it can take
>     it's toll on you. too much partying can be bad too. party hard, but party
>     wisely.'
>
> * December/January issue: Chris & Alex of Spawntaneous - they were at that
>    party SANCTUARY in Cleveland. and I interviewed them. Chris pointed out
>    that something was definitely wrong with our system. Alex just so
>    happened to be another person who od'ed & lived to tell about it.
>    and the interview with Ian, he pointed out how technology is moving faster
>    because  information can be transered faster via the internet. His message:
>    "its a very delicate time in human history & what we're doing as the
>    underground scene along with those connected by the internet with all this
>    information, is trying to up the people to a higher level of thinking then
>    what you're used to".
>
> So in a nutshell I finally figured it out that I was supposed to change things

I used to not dance to jungle.
It seemed too fast.  I loved it and all, but...
Well, that all changed.  I danced to
DJ Hustle's set, and it ruled!
He's really cool.  I got his mix tape, 
and I can't stop listening to it!>"When I raise my trigger finger all you
____ers hit the deck!"
Yeah!

Anyway, I have tons of drum n bass, and I am 
slightly confused as to the difference.
The only thing I noticed is that drum n bass
relies more on snares?  and has more of
a bass beat to it?,  and jungle has melodic bass?
Am I close?  No?
Help me out here.

hahaha...you're a fool...

and obviously so close minded to the pittsburgh scene,
you had no clue i gave the history of the OHIO rave scene
not the pittsburgh and east coast rave scene...

actually the first rave in pittsburgh was in december of 1991
it was called Psychotronic Stockrave w/ about 800 kids
go and seek Joel Bevacqua aka Deadly Buda and ask him...

ya, ya...Giovanni's Catastrophic partys in the Wust Hall in DC (and 
the Orb) wuz what inspired Lonnie and Jason to start throwing the
Ultraworld partys in Baltimore...

ya, ya...Frankie Bones, Adam X, Heather Heart AND Jimmy Crash
much much props for kickin off the east coast scene with the Storm
partys...as everybody and their mother knows already (actually
props should be given out to Jeno & Garth for gettin things rollin
on the West coast, while I'm on my li'l rampage here)...

ya, ya...Turbo-Zen Records @ 128 Oakland Ave. 3rd floor, Pittsburgh
PA 15213...phone 412.621.7759...fax 412.621.3001...yadda yadda...

i do, however, recall one mistake within my "Enlightenment" super
post...Rebirth actually happened on August 13, 1994 in Cleveland and
not 1993...however, for the other founding fathers of the ohio 
underground scene, check:
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/mw/regions/ohio/cleveland.html

but the true founding father of ALL the scenes...is STILL the Almighty
in heaven above...and that was the ultimate point of my "Enlightenment"
super post (however seein how you never even got the first part...)

man, i hate it when i gotta skool the newbies, can't somebody else do
this by now...

dear god!  Don't start this debate!!!  You may be unknowing of this fact
but this idiotic debate (your question isn't idiotic just the debate that
will probably ensue) has taken over at least three lists that I've been
on.  IMHO, jungle = america's hip-hop driven sped up breakbeat while dnb=
britain's more serious and cleaner sounding breakbeat derived more from
jazz, hardcore and rnb.  The difference is only how you see it though as
there is no real webster definition.

What????!!!
It was Dennis the Menace (Frankie's old roommate) that did the Storm
parties.  So, if that's what everyone & their mother thinks, they're
wrong.  He's now BML and represents Frankie, Adam X, and Jimmy Crash along
with about 50 others.

Wait, lemme stop this before it goes anywhere.
There's *no difference* between drum + bass and jungle.
They're two words used to refer to the same music.
Anyone who tells you otherwise is just talking out their ass.

More common subdivisions are:

jumpup - bouncy bass often has alot of samples/hiphop influence
ragga - dancehall influenced, vocalists
techstep - more mechanical, filtered, programmed beats
dark - sinister bass tones and fx
jazzy - pretty obvious - sax, flutes, jazz piano, etc...
intelligent - relies more on melody, synths, relaxed beats

but of course, many things blend or transcend any or all of these styles.
i'm not the last word on all these things, but i waste enough time
talking about the stuff to have a clue. ;)

Wow, did you dust off an old flyer that had this info on it just to 
impress us Pittsburghers?

If you're so down, how come no one around here has ever heard of you?

I'm unusually punctual!
I already started that DnB/Jungle tape!
Send me your address or something and I
can send it tomorrow!
(And don't worry about getting me back :)

Hey Pittsburgh-Cleveland Posse!

My name is Neki.....been on the list for awhile.....I know, I know, I 
haven't said much.....I like to listen :)

But anyway, this message is unfortunately only for those heads in 
Pittsburgh and vicinity.....you'll understand in a minute......

Alright, here's da dilleo:  I am a Staffing Coordinator with Interim 
Personnel....we are a temporary agency located in downtown 
Pittsburgh....we staff local doctor's offices, law firms, banks, and 
other kinds of companies with receiptionists, secretaries, data entry 
people, and the like.....the jobs we "get" in can be anywhere from one 
day long to temporary with the intention to hire.....most assignments 
are in downtown Pittsburgh or Oakland, occassionally we will get one in 
the suburbs......

Where do you fit in?  Well, quite frankly, I'm tired of giving people 
jobs that do not deserve them and hardly have the skills, personality, 
and work ethic suitable for positions......I'd much rather recruit from 
my fellow ravers.....people who need jobs....people who want 
jobs.....people who can use computers.....people who I will feel good 
about helping out :)

Temp work has many benefits (god, I'm starting to feel like a 
commercial).....if you get bored easily, you can accept short 
assignments for a constant change of scenery.....you get paid like you 
would at a normal job (there is *not* a fee)....you get weekends off 
(great for partying)......

Well, I don't wanna go on forever.....don't wanna say too much for those 
not interested.....but if you are interested, feel free to give me a 
call at work Monday through Fridays, 8:30 to 5:00 at 281-6068....I go by 
Nicole there.....be sure to ask for me and be sure to let me know that 
you are on the list (I'll give you top of the pile, special treatment 
that way :)  )

By the way, I'm really in a crunch with 2 positions right now.....one is 
on Neville Island and the other is by Century III Mall....need people 
right away....if those interest you, call me tomorrow (Tuesday) if at 
all possible......

Peace,
NekiCheese

<<I'm sure your design sucks.
Let's use Stevie T's!!>>

it's funny, i haven't designed a pb-cle t-shirt, but i did
design a PLUR T-shirt way back when...i gave 'em away 
for free to ravers that personified the PLUR concept...

one of the first recipients of one of the PLUR T-shirts
i designed is currently the list admin for PB-Cle-Raves,
non other than Trouty himself...i had lost my back pack
at one of the earlier Ele Mental Underground House
Partys and Jamie found it and returned it to me, so i
gave him a free PLUR T-shirt...

i did this for awhile, 'til it got too expensive (kinda why
i had to quit PLRM) in addition,...giving stuff away for free 
gets expensive after awhile...

however, if you would like me to do a T-shirt design for
Pb-Cle, i could do that also...i have a graffiti style very
similar to Sano (the graffiti artist who did the graffiti
flyers for Family Affair 4 and FURY)...since we're both
from the same city...one of the graffiti pieces i did is
currently in Walt's (Collective Intelligence) basement...
i gave it to him free as a Christmas gift...

interesting" with some new stuff from the playstation video game???   
Plus the LIGHTS and the BASS!!   

Vibe was pretty decent...had to look a bit but definetely nice people

Hello everyone,
  It's me, Ryu.  I've just released a compilation on my label, Sho
Records, and wanted to let you all know about it.  It features a
wide variety of musical styles, all of which are based in electronics.
Styles from hardcore breakbeats to house to industrial to hip hop
to goth...  
  
Artists from Pittsburgh that are featured on it:

-Mindless Faith
-The D-Boiz
-Ryu (me...duh....)

You can check out samples of the tracks at the Sho Homepage at:
http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/jwz109

OR IF YOU REPLY TO THIS EMAIL REALLY QUICKLY, I'LL SEND
YOU A FREE COPY!

Yep, the first 7 people that reply to this email to me personally, will
get a free copy sent to them.  I'll even pay shipping.  good deal, eh?
I just want people to hear this because it's great music.

And if you don't make the cut, the cd only costs $5 (including shipping)
and is ready to sell now.  You can email me, or fill out an online order
form at the web site.

Thanks for your time and your support....

White Gloves,
Ryu

Hi there.  Somebody wrote me an e-mail letting me know about an internet
site where I could purchase good techno music, but somebody screwed up
my machine and I lost the site.  Please let me know the name of the site
again if you can.



Thank You!!

Silly old me.  Yet again I have deleted information that I later would
find to need.  Whoops.  Anyway, could someone send me the information on
the West Virginia shindig?  What was it called?  Equinox?  Thank you.

The info for Cosmictribe's Equinox Gathering is posted at
www.theservice.net under "upcoming events." I would post all the info here,
but I  deleted it, too ... sorry!!! I will post the directions here on
thursday evening or friday morning. 

We would also like to get a head count. SO... if anyone plans on coming,
please email me within the next few days. Thanks!

Heh heh...
I am looking for 1200s.
Anyone who knows anyone
who is selling any used, cheap
tables, (or even just one) please tell me.
I'm sick of the shitty pitch control

last night at scj, my friend justin got the best idea for a t-shirt ive 
heard in a while....its kinda in the "serial killer" vein of 
apparel....it will have a picture of special prosecuter kenneth starr 
and underneath it the caption "player-hater"
:)
thats the best thing i heard all night
scj was nice, absolut rocked it, and sine was nice till i left @ around 
12:30
also, if youre a male, avoid needing an std test if at all 
possible....it involves shoving a q-tip INSIDE your penis...its not a 
comfortable predicament

     gotta love how tom manages to contradict
     himself in only a few short words. hey, tom,
     at least it wasn't kenneth starr with the 
     q-tip :P

     by the way, steel city jungle rocked, or 
     jungled, or whatever. i got quite a few 
     friends to show - watch for more next time.
     i danced my little ass off. shouts to tom,
     john, jbrick [cis reprazent], josh ryan, 
     andythebrew, joshkoshbgoshorwhatever, dori,
     todd, liquid.

     all the rest of you who didn't show - shame
     on you. i better see your sad faces on 
     thursday, or friday. or saturday :]

Ok.  That person from Maine who wanted
a tape of some good DnB and Jungle,
I finished it.  I need your address and
stuff so I can send it.
I accidentally erased your mails.

And to all thought I was spinning
and making a Jungle mix tape, I wasn't!
I only dubbed a CD and tape of mine!
I just spin house.
If you do want a mix tape, you'll
have to wait till I can get on some
1200s.  Don't worry, I know quite a few
people with tables, so it won't be long.

     yeah, you do. :]  watch me, fiend.

     steel city jungle is every other tuesday at
     club laga in oakland. it starts at 10pm or
     shortly thereafter, costs $5, and ends at 2am.
     the next one is on october 6th, with djs
     michele sainte, dj2 + sine, and MVP. for info
     call: 412.734.8443. club laga is 3609 forbes
     avenue, ask one of the pittsburgh raver massiv
     if you're lost. if you're into poison there is
     a bar with the usual toxins. 18 and over, 21 to
     drink.

     on thursday it's atomic down in the strip at
     metropol. this happens every week, i don't look
     at the lineup anymore, i just show up, but
     tommy sunshine should be spinning. it starts
     at 8pm, but nobody shows until 10 or so. 18 and
     over. $5 for under 21, $2 for over. bring your 
     id, and it had better be a good one. be ready
     to dance until 2am when the lights come on and
     they throw your E-d up little butt onto the 
     street. call HOS for info i guess. metropol 
     is on smallman street in the strip, pittsburgh.

     friday is exposure. doran chambers, tommy 
     sunshine, josh ryan, tr generation et. al. 
     $15 at the door. call DNS at 412.734.5298.
     should be fun, first pittsburgh party in a 
     while.

     saturday (for me) is motive in columbus.
     robert hood, joey beltram, etc. i'm not sure
     on the price, bring a canned good for a 
     discount. 614.792.8850 for info. otherwise
     you could run up to buffalo for square with
     mike dearborn, t1000, and boo williams. call
     716.888.8678 for that one. $17 presale.

     in any case, there just isn't _any_ excuse
     for not having fun this weekend.

     turn on, tune in, drop madly, wig out.

     hugs

I made a mistake.  The rave in columbus is called motive.  I got it
mixed up with Barely legal in Cleveland.  Does anybody know where Motive
is going to be held in columbus, please let me know since I'll be
traveling from Cleveland.

Motive will take place somewhere downtown columbus, exact direx 
won't be given out 'til the day before, but if you went to TILT, you
should know...coming from cleveland or northeast ohio, all you gotta
do is shoot down 71 south & that takes you straight by downtown
columbus...as does 70 west coming from the penn state area...

here's the info for the pre-party for motive on friday night in

Hey you guys!  <...its the electric company..>

Just wanted to give major props to Absolut for a wicked set @ SCJ,
definitely tight mixing and nice selection overall. :)  

To all you tech 1200 wanters...i might suggest checking out:
www.ebay.com - its a net auction.  If you seach for turntables you'll get
a pretty long list of tables people have up for auction, and there always
seems to be one or two 1200's up there.  I recently got one for $325.
Of course be careful when dealing with folks over the net...

Obviously you're a little mixed up about who is whining about newbies, 
so please get your story straight before you insult me.  I'm sending

Yea, we're a little involved with Magick.
No hard feelings about your post.
At least I know you won't be in Pittsburgh on Halloween.

I would recommend seeing pi if only 'cuz it's the first movie I have
seen w/ a jungle score...very cool.
there is lots of good stuff on the soundtrack, tho looking @ the credits
a lot of the stuff on the cd's not in the movie.  I remember hearing
stc's track in the beach scene.  I think I remember hearing bucephalus
bouncing ball too(the afx track).  the soundtrack was put compiled by
sioux zimmerman, who is the pr-type person for trent reznor, crystal
method (i think), and a few other people.  clint mansell (of pop will
eat itself fame, but not the guy in bentley rhythm ace) did the score
that was repeated throughout the movie, i.e. the jungle stuff w/ the
three note riff.  I think he has three tracks on the cd.  mansell met
darren aranofsky (sp?), the director, while he was doing the film and
thats how he became involved in doing the music.

I had been looking forward to seeing pi a lot for a long time, from the
time it got press when it came out in real cities to the time about 4
months later it finally opened in Pittsburgh.   I was a bit
disappointed, too. I liked it, but it didn't kick my ass like I thought
it would.  Visually it was stunning tho.  movies shot in video usually
bother me but this looked great...

I thought they worked in the math pretty well.  It remained relatively
plausible for me, which is pretty unusual for movies w/ this sort of
subject matter.

I'm pretty sure in a few years this'll be a cult film.  also check out
the website www.pithemovie.com  
It's pretty good and it was done by the film's star.  that's indie
cred:)

OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!

I am so damn happy!
This cool kid, Case,
just called me!  Next weekend
he's bringing up 2 Technics 1200s,
a Numark mixer, 
AND HE IS LETTING ME BORROW IT ALL!!!
(He has no room in his room for them, 
 and they are just sitting at his house.
 I figure this is good for both of us, 
 seeing how he can come over to my place
 anytime and spin, too.)
I've never spun on anything better than 
a 1600!
So I'll have some tapes out REALLY soon!!!

YES!!!!!!!!!

SCJ was bomb as hell last nite!  Props to absolut for layin down that
bomb set.  That 5 on it remix is tight as hell!  Shouts out to
everyone I saw up there (absolut, tom, geekboy, andy).  It hard to
remember the last time I enjoyed an entire set that much.  I was out
on the dancefloor the entire time!  Those of you who couldnt make it,
you missed out!  Hope to see some of ya at exposure!

Peace,
Josh

> exposure is friday with doran chambers and tommy sunshine 
> who is going ?

what's up, all?

i'll be in attendence and i'm quite lookin forward to it. this school
year and my parents are really startin to piss me off (sorry about my
absence from steel city... i tried - really, i did!) and a nice
rave'll do me some good. i really like the looks of this one (quite
honestly, to me it looks like one of those sunshine kids raves from
96, which WERE incredible despite the "greatest promoter of all time".
he must have been doing something right, tho, because the vibe was
incredible for all of em!).

well enuff of that. back to work.

net meet anyone? i'm gonna leave it up to others....

hey kids,

its been a while since i've posted anything to this list so i figured out
i;d say hi... this place looks much different than when i left... which is i
guess a good thing.. although its gonna take some getting used to...

i think the screening process is a good idea.. although i am a bit confused
abt the chriteria for acceptance to these lists.. i also thoght it was a bit
odd taht there was a screening process at all.. but i've been informed
abtthe drama thats been going on on some of these lists so i guess it was a
necessary addition...

although i think a week is a way long time for my request to finally go
through... thankfully tho.. i passed the hyperreal.org piss test.. and here
i am :D

as far as parties go.. i've only been to 2 sicne my return to the states in
august... here are short reviews...

Sunshine Festival in Baltimore...

baltimore as a city is limited to like 1 party a year.. so when they
actually do have a party, u know its gonna rock.. as this years festival
did... it was held outdoors at some park... (i'm not at all fumilar w
baltimore.. sorry) and there were lots of friendly DC party kids there...
lots of hippies.. which i love... and lots of great music...

Dubtribe ... Heather.. who absolutely rocked it... Scott Henry.. who palyed
SuperStar.. (prolly my fave song of the summer) and i satrted bouncing off
the cieling...and a few others who i forget (the party was like a month
ago... i'm not a big fan of Duntribe.. but they kept rallying all the party
kids.. so there was thsi kickass vibe going around...

people knew that if they fucked up and got all shady, they would get called
on it.. and they would loose the right to throw even one party in
baltimore.. so everyone who was there... including the army of narcs...
(totally inconspicuous in there club gear)  knew what the deal was... these
were some really well behaved party kids... not a bad vibe in sight.. it was
beautiful...

there werea ton of kids from south jersey there too.. kids who i always run
into in nyc.. except w\out being in nyc... it was great i wish there were
parties in baltimore more often... oh well.. there;s always DC i guess...

i also went to a party in cleveland 2 or 3 weeks ago.. comander tom was
suppoed to be there.. but he didnt show... (i forget what its called)

this was an AWSOME party... reinforcing once again my opinion that Ohio
parties have the best vibe ANYWHERE... the shade was kept to a minimum..
even shady looking kids were all vibe and happy when talking to you... i was
the kid walking around w\ the helium balloon tied to my bag (and floating
above me) in case any of u kids saw me...

i also saw this girl holding a netmeet sign.. but i think i showed up too
late so i didnt get to meet anyone...

now a word abt Comander Tom.. although i think he is an AWSOME dj... next
time i see him i'm gonna break one ofhis cd right in front of him.. the
story i got was that b/c of that plane crash taht happenned a few days b4
the party, he was to afraid to fly and so he had to cancel...

of course he shows up to the monkey party in ny tho... its so agrivating..
its like.. too afraid to fly -- whatever!!! .. be a man .. suck it the fuck
up and go spin for the happy party kids who drove all that way to come hear
u... grrr!! what an asshole...

besides that... everything was cool... the other dj;s were excellent -- even
tho most of teh dj;s were not-quite-superstars (mostly local talent),,, they
still rocked the fucking space...

and this time there were plenty of pittsburgh kids there... which is the way
it should always be...


anyway.. i've rambled on and on for way too long.. as usual... i'll be at
the party in pittsburgh this friday if i can find a ride... which looks like
its gonna happen.. i'll also be at Metropol tomorrow nite... so maybe i'll
see ome of u kids there...

and then 3 weks from now.. MIXX and BOO3... i'm intend to be at both of
these parties... its been over a year since i've been to the roxy and am way
excited b/c there are always kick ass parties there (its prolly my fave
party space)... and MIXX... prolly the RAREST lineup i've seen in a while...
a party like this doesnt happen very oftne at all (where as BOO3 looks like
every other big nyc party.. same 15 dj's -- they are amazin -- true.. but u
can pretty much hear them every other weekend in nyc...) thats not exactly
true of MIXX... u should all come out for this one...

lemme kneo what u kids plan on doing in the next couple weeks -- maybe we
can arange to meet up etc...

much love,

galve.

can anyone of you strapping young lads or fine young ladies tell me if you=
 know what's going on at trilogy tomorow night?  will there be any out of=
 town talent on the decks, or will it be rob sherwood, or what?  are there=
 any other events or clubs worth checking out in cleveland tomorow night? =
 preferably something that isn't over 10 bucks, i'm bringing non-ravers, and=
 i don't think they're interested in spending their life savings on the=
 night, since they're all po' ass college kids.  thanks for any help.  steve

synthvortx@aol.com doesnt like the way i run the rom and says hyperreal is
a joke and is concerned about the state of the rom with the beastie boys
and front 242 listed on it.  comments to trout@hyperreal.org

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events, just testing this out and we'll see what the
reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

F-S Sep 25-27                    EQUINOX GATHERING                Harrisville, WV

This gathering will be located on a 250 acre homestead, in Harrisville,
West Virginia. We will be using the 6000 watt lovelab soundsystem. It will
be $5 at the door.  All proceeds go to the non-profit organization called
the Mon Valley green-space coalition.

The purpose of this event is to bridge societal gaps (cultural, spatial,
or generation) by providing a bases for commonality.  As we take the time
to notice the changing of the season we are reminded that the Earth
supports us all; granting us life from her vast, yet dilapidating
resources.  This event is to be one of celebration for the life which
flows through us all.  It is our hope that this gathering will provide a
platform upon which we can all learn from one another. We will be
discussing both the endangered greenspace on campus (the old stadium) and
the Blackwater Canyon forest. 

This is to be a three day, two night event.  The system will be shut off
during the day, giving way to other activities such as yoga, hiking, &
drumming.  There will be a family dinner Saturday night followed by dance
meditation and an opening circle, leading into funkadelic, techno
vibrations.

We ask that people bring a donation for the kitchen.  Every person should
bring approximately $10 worth of raw ingredients. Contributions merit
'food bracelets' which when presented to the kitchen will allow you to eat
(as long as supplies last).  Also, any additions to Saturday night's
pot-luck will be greatly appreciated:)

U L T R A W O R L D 
in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

Saturday November 28 1998
Washington DC prepares to
 
E  N  E  R  G  I  Z  E

Thanksgiving weekend, Ultraworld will present the most 
spectacular event in its 6 year history. It will be held 
in the massive DC Armory, and while there have been four 
previous events in this space, none will compare to the 
spectacle of Energize.

The main arena of this space has over 100,000 sqft of 
wide-open wooden floor, but what will set Energize
apart from our previous events is that we will make use
of additional space in the basement! The basement has
40' ceilings and is the same size as the main floor but
divided into three massive sections. For the first time 
at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all 
with full on concert level production in both sound and 
lighting.  


>>The Main Floor:

Ultraworld will fill this space with the best sound system they
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of 
lasers, projection screens and intelligent lighting. Appearing
On the main floor:

Exclusive live performance by 
CARL CRAIG as Paperclip People (Planet E, Detroit)

with DJs
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI (Matsuri Productions, London/Tokyo)
DOC MARTIN (Tight, Los Angeles)
DJ ICEY (Zone, Orlando)
SCOTT HENRY (Buzz, Washington DC)
T-1000 (Generator/DJax, Detroit)
NIGEL RICHARDS (611 Records, Philadelphia)

 
>>The Drum N Bass arena:

In one of the basement areas, Ultraworld and 2-Tuff are 
proud to present a selection of the best Drum 'N' Bass talent 
the US has to offer, alongside two of the originators of the
UK scene. In the d'n'b arena:

GROOVERIDER (Sony/Prototype, UK)
FABIO (Creative Source, UK)
MC GQ (the UK's premier MC)
DARA (Breakbeat Science, NYC)
DIESELBOY (Platinum, Philadelphia)
AK1200 (Moonshine, Orlando)
DB (Breakbeat Science, NYC) 
SLANT (2 Tuff, Washington DC)
ENTITY (Ultraworld, Baltimore)
FLUID (Sonic Soul, Baltimore)
MC DUB2 (Philadelphia)


>>The House arena:

This second basement area is bigger then any dance club 
on the East Coast. It will be hosted by Philadelphia's
Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long. 

DERRICK CARTER (Organico, Chicago)
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION (Universal Language, UK)
FEELGOOD (Charm City Records, Baltimore)
KENNY GLASGOW (Toronto)
O'KEEFE (Circle, Philadelphia)
ROB PAINE (Circle, Philadelphia)

main room at most clubs! This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
Sonic Soul, America's premier chill-out crew. You can dance if you 
want to...

For your convenience, tickets will also be available 
through Ticketmaster for those who don't have a ticket
outlet close-by.

Also, We are working with the Buzz crew to make this an 
extended weekend. For those of you who may not know, Buzz 
is DC's premier club event, held every Friday by DJ's Scott
Henry and Lieven De Geyndt. It plays host to the world's top 
DJ's and live acts on a weekly basis. When you purchase

Wow 200!  That's pretty impressiv for the pb-cle area. 
  
Big-Up the list!! :) 

Really, that's like 10% of the biggest event thats ever been here, and a
great deal more (probably like a third) of any regular event (consider 600
folks is a decent rave).   If we got everybody to put in $10, donate what
they could, we could throw a badass rave ourselves.

still like to be there with all of you.  Help me out if you know the
location of this party.  Pleeeez!!!

Sincerely

how does one go about adding their name and e-addy to the Roll Call for a
particular party... back in the olden days, one would just post their intent
to be preasant at a particular party and that was the end of that....

things seem so different these days... have i really been out of the loop
for THAT long???

galve.

ps... i'm going to Exposure.. provided i can find transportation ... does
anyone know where exactly this party will be held?? (pittsburgh is a pretty
big fucking place to travel on foot)

so add one more to the roll call list:

galve@ibm.net Costas.

but i haven't filled out an application for netmeet, am i not allowed in?  i
never know where i'm going to be anyways.

i need to get to west virginia for the equinox celebration from cleveland on
saturday.  i'm all stocked up on toys, tapes+cd's, stickers, and smiles.  i'm
good at kissing ass.  help meee

Check out www.ravedata.com
Magick is on their main screen
Everyone should take a minute
or two to look at their fill-in-the-
blank section.
They still need info. on certain
DJs and events.  Any ACCURATE
info. will add to the site which is a
very nice tool for promoters and
ravers alike.

i was talking to a friend of mine from ny and he told me about a party going
on tomorrow nite called

AN EVENING WITH DERRYCK CARTER AND GREEN VELVET
@ Vinyl in NYC... and he told me that Tommy Sunshine is on the DJ lineup...

 but...

you'll also nnotice he's on the EXPOSURE flier for tomorro nite...

now, i've heard of dj's spinning in 2 cities on the same nite... (this being
quite common for nyc and phily)

but nyc and pittsburgh?? that makes no sense at all... i've done the trip in
5.5 hrs driving... and it takes anywhere form 1 to 2 by plane...

but it still doesnt make any sense that he;d be spinning at both parties..
also... the kids throwing the party in nyc are pretty legit... and Tommy
Sunshine isnt headlining in ny or anything.. hes; just a random dj on the
lineup... but he;s kinda headlining at EXPOSURE... my point?? there would be
no reason for the ny kids to lie abt Toommy Sunshine spinning there... but
as one of the headliners of the pittsburgh party... it is quite possible
that the kids throwing EXPOSURE are promising something they can not
deliver...

does anyone really know whats going on?? .. i met this couple who said they
are throwing EXPOSURE in Cleveland a couple weeks ago,, and they seemed
pretty cool.. they were really friendly and certious... so i dont know what
to think...

any info is much apreciated... i'm still going (provided i find some way to
get there btw) but i;d like to know what to expect...

galve.

Oh my...a NEW venue??  I can't remember going to a tippins warehouse
before.  Nice!  I don't know the DNS crew very well, but my *impression*
is that they are very professional and cool, so I wouldn't worry about
them coming through on anything on the flyer.  Coolio.

Does anyone here know anything about Zyban? I have heard that it interacts
badly with other drugs, paritcularly alcohol, but I want to know any other
info about it. Their website doesn't really say. It seems that a friend of
mine may have had a reaction from mixing E with it, but it's hard to tell.
I just want to know if anyone has had any experiences with it. Anyway, let
me know...
Thanks,
Amber

I am also new to this list, and would definetly like to meet some of you as
well. What I am going to do is ask people if they belong to the list.  I am
bound to run into some people once I start asking.

O.K.  We will set the NET MEET to the RIGHT of the MENS ROOM at 2:00am.  I
will be walking around with a PB-CLE RAVES laminate, if you see me I will give
you a laminate also.  We have to set up a place because there are still a lot
of people who don't know anyone on the list to see them.

Everyone needs to remember that "SHIT HAPPENS" once in a while.  I've seen the
same DJ on 2 flyers in 2 non-neighboring cities at least a dozen times.  It
usually has nothing to do with the individuals throwing the events.  It almost
always has to do with the agents (some DJs have more than one) double booking
the DJ.  I've had to sit down and think for a minute about who exacly to call to
book a DJ: Should I call Sasha, Sasha's European agent, The agent in the States
(east coast or west coast), The guy who runs the label, Sasha's Grandma, Sasha's
Great Aunt Mary (she gives the best deals), or the guy who cleans his house!
Get my drift?
DJs get double booked sometimes.

<< O.K.  We will set the NET MEET to the RIGHT of the MENS ROOM at 2:00am.  I
 will be walking around with a PB-CLE RAVES laminate, if you see me I will
give
 you a laminate also.  We have to set up a place because there are still a lot
 of people who don't know anyone on the list to see them.

hi.

i am in atlanta, ga now...i am flying back up to akron this evening 
arriving at 6 pm...my friend who is picking me up at the airport cannot 
make it to the party tonite. 

if there is anyone in the akron/cle area who would be able to give me a 
ride (i only need a ride to pittsburgh, one way)...i would appreciate 
it.

i also can get one person into the party for free along with me. so if 
that's any incentive...

i am going to be checking my email until about 2pm (its 11am now)...and 
then when i get back to cleveland (if i havent heard from anyone in the 
meantime), ill be checking it around 7... so if you can help me out, 
please fire off a quick reply and let me know. thanks alot.


peace,
hossam

I was at IQ last week, or atleast passing by... I looked in and it seems to me
that everything has been moved.  If the store sucked, and you're wondering
why, you really shouldn't be.  Most of the kids in Erie listen to teeny-bopper
music or rap, or atleast that's my opinion.

wasnt loud enough to motivate me....doran chambers was alright, better 
when his stuff got harder toward the end....tr generation was absolutely 
fucking spectacular, i love those guys, theyre so fucking good....i got 
out before tommy sunshine played, as i wanted to get some sleep, etc.

Wow, what a party!
This party had all the sunshine. And Tommy was just the tip of it all.

The virgin venue was a lodge bar/restaurant(off limits)/dance hall in Etna
of all places.  Arrived around 11:30 or so and parked in the designated
parking lot which was about a block away from the lodge where the party was
held. It was awfly quiet and a parking attendant appeared out of nowhere
instructing that I should head directly to the space, no trips to the Dairy
Mart because the township had a curfew law which supposedly applied to
those under 21. (hmmmmmmm.. Doesn't sound right to me)  Anyways, upon
getting to the door word was not only did all the town's police officers,
the fire chief but also the mayor of the town had been regularly visiting
the space very concerned at first about the kids on the street.  I am
pretty familiar now with the door people at these mid sized Pittsburgh
raves, and knew they would do their best to keep things in order.  I wasn't
really worried about a 12 o'clock shutdown.

Dj^2 was spinning jungle and the lights and sound in the place were
fantastic including the stunning visuals (same ones used at metropol , only
this time down on the ground with the dancers)

After the Jungle set, the announcement was made to everyone about the
situation regarding the apparent city 'emergency which had caused all the
kings men to assemble and patrol the party.  In true Pittsburgh vibe the
crowd cheered and that set the tone for the night, this was gonna be one
phat party and if you couldn't take it, leave!

Joshua Ryan played a grooving fast paced trancy set that the crowd really
enjoyed (yelling, whistle massive). I was very happy with the way things
had turned out by the middle of his set.

Next came Doran Chambers, who played a wicked hard set of trancey
progressive house that again had the floor pumping.  I haven't seen his
auditory sunshine since 'fantastic and was very happy he made it back to
Pittsburgh.

TR Generation tore up the space with a hard and fast trance dance live PA.
The cool lighted eyegoggles were in effect and so was the bouncy bouncy guy
next to him.  I expect to hear some really great things from these guys in
the future.

Tommy Sunshine electrified us all.  I have never seen him before but his
electro set had me more than wishing I took those breakdancing lessons in
5th grade!  He was bobbing his head the whole time and the vibe just flew
right off of him and into the floor.

B.Dee made things a bit more mellow for the last of the morning hours. And
even Tommy Sunshine spent most of the time on the floor for B.Dee's set
blinding the already worked up floor. (As did Joshua Ryan during Doran
Chambers')

At the end cheers (hehe) were made in honor of the Etna township official
massive.  And Tommy asked to thank the Pgh scene personally for the kickass
time he had and the fact he  had no doubts about passing up a New York gig
for this party!  Tommy rocks and I can't wait for him to return.

So there was no big bust. Only one problem child incident. (People, heroin
etc are not party drugs! Tell your friends to keep that shit out. Y0!)

Major props to the couple(?) who had this party [it def had a sunshine
vibe], the awesome security who kept things in check, Wizard Workshop Sound
(the acoustics r0cked), ELectrolyte, the computer visuals crew (they can
dance too), Dj Sine, Product 19, Mr Rab for the kickass pb-cle laminates
and the rest of the pb-cle raves crew!!!

Hopefully this great space can be used again, and go smoother next time
without the fear of a local municipality witchunt.  Thanks Etna! This was a
lesson for those of us on both sides of the speakers and it seemed like we
all gained from it.

Pittsburgh bounce, let's do it again!

plur,

jbrick

    Well.....I thought I'd review this phat party eventhough not alot of
people from the list were there or even heard about it....so anyways.
    Phat Free was a free party to "test out" a site. Everything went
well and Benny and I had a blast! It was in a barn at a farm outside of
cleveland. Very interesting place. The Djs and dancefloor was inside,
but there were people everywhere. The very memorable thing was the hole
in the wall you had to climb through in order to watch the DJ or dance
in the "main room". The people were very nice and there was very cool
variety of music. From Techno to Jungle, House and Speed Garage.....
    All in all a great time. I think the roosters in the morning topped
off the night for me.

-matt

P.S. rumor has it, there may be another party at the same location some
time in the near future. Keep your eyes and ears peeled?

Does anyone know the deal with the moonshine tour ? I have heard rumors that it may have been canceled in Cleveland. I have not seen a single flyer yet, only a few promo posters for the entire tour. Let me know whats up.

Sorta.
A few may have heard of my incidents that keep cropping up.  One happened 
on the fourth of the july the other on the weekend of september 13th. They 
are both part of why I have disapeared from the scene for a bit.

To make a long story short:
Im perminently off of any/all types of party-drugs. (Not that I would admit 
to doing any publicly anyway :)
Probably wont be going to any parties beyond local bbq/hangout styles for 
another month or two. (My heart, body and mind in general are in really bad 
shape and I need to be carefull)

I cant dance anymore :( for a very long time. I know some people really 
loved my dancing (fuck modesty) and im sorry to disapoint.

But the saddest part of all of this is that this is all sideaffects of me 
getting better! How fucked is that? I almost became a casultie of the rave 
scene at FA4. Yup, almost died from too much fun, this is not a puton.  I 
almost left the physical world on july 4th and I almost left the mental 
world on september 13th.

THIS IS A WAKEUP CALL! BE CAREFULL OUT THERE!  People always think (myself 
included) itl never happen to me, im safe, i know what im doing. Well I 
thought I did.  I fought the devil and almost lost.  I stared death in the 
face and he said, watchit budy, dont make me come and get you.  (I think he 
is pissed it was only a close encounter so im not taking any chances)

Im back on the list, I still consider myself a scenester (whatever that is) 
and I miss the massive netmeets (and from watching the list it looks like 
we are still picking up speed, dear-god we really are gunna be a massive)

Ill start going to raves again someday, I cant stay away for long, i WONT 
stay away for long.  But I gotta get intouch with my inner being (wow 
trippy man) it is possible to party too hard.

So where the hell is Dan!?!? And be on the lookout for Schwanke2.0 coming 
to a rave scene near you.

Though I will make exceptions for any mostly house/trance/progressive raves 
(since im perfectly content sitting and listening at them) I think I have 
the date for one saved around here somewhere.

hey hey hey...

well - i got to go to exposure from 11-2, so i dont have much so say
other than:

--dj squared rolled it out nice + mellow
--josh ryan played a SMOOTH set of progressive somethingorother
--props goin out to DNS for keeping that shit together even tho every
official in the city came
--shout out to MrRab for the nifty pb-cle laminate
--there were A LOT of kids there who looked much younger than me... @
least 10. i guess this might be a product of the whole
chemicalbrothers+cohitthemainstream? it's all good, tho.

the infoline says:

"thanks to everyone who came out... apologize for some of the police
incidents, sometimes it just cant be controled... thanks to everyone
who was on their best behavior... we need to start to learn that the
scene isn't all about drugs, thanks to the kid overdosing on the
floor... a little sad... gives us a bad name as promoters in the city,
it is going to get to the point where NO ONE will let us do anything
around here, regardless of how much money you have, or who you know.
they're just gonna shut it down and that's the way it's gonna be. so
we're gonna have to do something to change that."


that's it.

happy birfday, tom (3/4 christmas!)

Exposure was a blast!  Heres the review:

venue: I liked it.  Aside from the fact that there were houses right
across the street which worried me from the beginning because of noise
violations, I thought it couldnt have been much better.  

music: I really enjoyed it.  I like jungle better than house, but the
shit that was bein played on Friday night was awesome.  My favorite
set was probably Tommie Sunshine's.  But then again Tr-Generation was
damn good too.

lighing: I thought that screen with all the images on it was phat as
hell!  There was all kind of trippy shit up there.  When ever I wasnt
in front of the dj dancing like crazy I was over there checkin out the
screen.  I noticed a one point that some headz were dancing behind the
screen and there shadows were plastered on it.  That was cool as hell!

the vibe: damn good!  Everyone was very friendly, and I met a whole
bunch of new people.  There were  a lot of people dancing and having a
good time.  I also noticed a whole lot of smiley faces!

Shouts out to Frankie G, Absolut, Geekboy, Spike, Tom, Andy, jbrick,
Jennifer Foulmond, sine, Joel and the CMU crew, and all the rest of
the pb-cle massive.  Also a special thanx to Mr. Rab:)  Hope everyone
there had a great time!  

Later,
Josh

ok, here's my 2cents:

Exposure was a nice party, but more in terms of people than in music.
While TR-Generation *kicked* my ass, I was not as impressed by the djs.
Tommy was pretty good, but I was disappointed that he didn't scratch. (I
think I've seen Donald Glaude in Seattle too many times- it's just not
breaks w/o scratching =) the jungle at the beginning was nice, but I'm
not keen on progressive trance, so I wasn't really grooving until
tr-gen. b-dee's orbital at the end of the party was a nice touch.

The vibe was a bit weird- hardly anyone was dancing the whole night.
Most everyone was kind of hanging out, but that turned out to be really
nice... I saw so many of you list kids! Even Tom looked happy for once
(clearly having a happy birthday =) The posse: Andy (you rock!), Jeff,
jp, kevin, tom, joe, andres, spike, geekboy (nice hair!), geoff (you're
a naughty boy), josh, yusei & taku (type-0 represent) and everyone else.

Amusingly enough, I ran into xspyboy, costas, donnie & co. last night in
squirrel hill. small world or something. (I hope w. virginia was fun ;)

that's all folks
Erica

Friday night turned out to be a pretty big disappointment for me.  I
was _so_ excited about this; it was my b-day, and all of my closest
friends were able to go w/ me.  
	We got to the party around 12:30 and everything was cool.  I liked the
space other than the fact that the music wasn't loud enough and I didn't
like the elk's club-type atmosphere.  I'm not sure why, but those pix of
the middle-aged white guys and such on the wall near the entrance
bothered me a bit.  what can i say, i'm odd. 
	Anyway I proceeded directly towards the speakers and the nifty
projection thing and started dancing.  About 20 minutes later I talked
to one of my friends and she told me that she had been talking to
someone she knew and he had rubbed her hand with a dollar bill so she
might start tripping.  this bothered me quite a bit. I think that to do
that to anyone is messed up, but to make it worse, my friend has a
serious depression problem. Fortuneately, it turned out ok.  I spent
most of the rest of the night with her and she remained completely calm,
tripping very mildly.  
	Just when things were starting to look good again, another of my
friends told me he wasn't feeling well and was going to lay down. 
Fifteen minutes later he returned and said he felt like shit and had
just thrown up.  (I have no idea where he threw up, btw.  If he didn't
make it to the bathroom, I apologize to whoever had to clean it up.  It
wasn't drug-related or his fault, he just got sick.)  He really looked
bad and so we left after being there less than 2 hours.  The only good
thing was that etna is pretty much right across the river from my house
and so it didn't take long to get home.
	If this wasn't all bad enough the next morning got even worse.  My
friend who got sick spent the night at my house and when he went to go
home he found the lock on his car had been popped off and his cd player
got stolen.  This was the second time in a couple months his cd player
got stolen.  

	Despite all this I still did have a good time, but it could have
obviously gone much better.  oh well, next time I guess..

All I have to say is it was awesome!  Ok...I lied...it was FUCKING AWESOME!
It was my first rave, and definately a time worth remembering.  I never met so
many people in one night than in my 19 years of life!!!  The DJ's were all
great.  At 4am whoever that DJ was...he kicked ass!  The lights where sweet,
and those phat designs on the celing and walls were awesome!  The vibe was
great.  I have to say, that I am sooooo happy that my first rave was spent
with the Pb-Cle kids.  Thank you so much for making my time better!  Thanks to
Matt, Benny, Byron, Jeremy, and.....well....whoever else I forgot to mention
that I was hangin with!  Due to the circumstance of my mental ability
yesterday, I have forgoten many names from the Pb-Cle kids, so if you remember
me, please send me mail!  And thanks Matt for letting me crash at your place!
There is so much more I could write, but I dont want to make you guys read a
novel, so thats it!  Ummm....did I mention that the show was awesome?
Well....I know I cant compare other raves, so I guess that means I will have
to go more often!  peace...

What ever happened to the thread? I kinda missed it. 
Did we decide on anything or go anywhere?
Also I have a couple other nonrave related tshirt projects so if
anyone can point me to a good source of info and maybe cheep companies
(or friends :) that would be great.

Just wanted to say "good-bye" for a couple of weeks on Rich's behalf.
He'll be on his way to Israel in a couple of days for the party of a
life-time on the desert on the Dead Sea:  The Bass Prophecy.  John
Dwight (Udg.-Tunnel Vision) is organizing this HUMUNGOUS thing and they
expect more than 20,000 people.  The line-up includes Run DMC, The
Chemical Bros., Dieselboy, Atomic Babies, & Bigjohnstud.  John is coming
back to the burgh a few weeks after.  All of Rich's babies are gettin'
busy again: Sunshine Kids, Udg. (we'll see).
Obviously I'll be on my own since my promotions king will be away.  So,
any anxious little flyer hustlers need not apply...they job is yours!

 >>
 >> A lady in a faded gingham dress and her husband, dressed in a homespun
 >> threadbare suit, stepped off the train in Boston, and walked timidly
 >> without an appointment into the president's outer office.  The secretary
 >> could tell in a moment that such backwoods, country hicks had no business
 >> at Harvard and probably didn't even deserve to be in Cambridge.
 >>
 >> She frowned. "We want to see the president", the man said softly.
 >>
 >> "He'll be busy all day," the secretary snapped.  "We'll wait," the lady
 >> replied.
 >>
 >> For hours, the secretary ignored them, hoping that the couple would
 >> finally become discouraged and go away.  They didn't.   And the secretary
 >> grew frustrated and finally decided to disturb the president, even though
 >> it was a chore she always regretted to do.   "Maybe if they just see you
 >> for a few minutes, they'll leave," she told him.  And he sighed in
 >> exasperation and nodded.  Someone of his importance obviously didn't have
 >> the time to spend with them, but he detested gingham dresses and homespun
 >> suits cluttering up his outer office.  The president, stern-faced with
 >> dignity, strutted toward the couple.
 >>
 >> The lady told him, "We had a son who attended Harvard for one year.  He
 >> loved Harvard.  He was happy here. But about a year ago, he was
 >> accidentally killed.  And my husband and I would like to erect a memorial
 >> to him, somewhere on campus".  The president wasn't touched he was
 >> shocked.  "Madam," he said gruffly, "We can't put up a statue for every
 >> person who attended Harvard and died.  If we did, this place would look
 >> like a cemetery".
 >>
 >> "Oh, no," the lady explained quickly, "We don't want to erect a statue.
 >> We thought we would like to give a building to Harvard.
 >>
 >> The president rolled his eyes.  He glanced at the gingham dress and
 >> homespun suit, then exclaimed, "A building! Do you have any earthly idea
 >> how much a building costs?  We have over seven and a half million dollars

anything for the flyer!!  Thanks.

Does anyone know how to get in touch w/ Eric D? His records were left in the
car. Im sure he is freaking out about now, so if anyone can reach
him....could you let him know that they are where he left them, and if he
wants to come pick them up or have them dropped off to let someone know.

Thanks
Amy

"Chicken make me wanna go crazy!"

  that was the theme of my weekend so far....a very fun one indeed.
Checked out 3 pretty different shows/events and they were all top notch
funtimes in their own way...so here's the reviews:

---
Friday - "The Aquabats + Mysuperhero + ???" @ laga

The aquabats are amazing!  Yeah, you might say, hay, this doesn't go on a
rave list.  Ok maybe you got me there.  But i have to say, this band is
exceptionally good at the music they play, AND they use alot of audience
participation and crazy visual stuff that just makes it fun fun fun to go
to their show.  Take one heepin' spoon of skacore, a scoop or two of goofy
the tick/60's batman style superhero theatrics, a few puffs on the happy
pipe, and you got the aquabats.  

Highlights of the show include: the band having an all-out rumble with
their arch nemesis the evil dr. bison and his henchmen the cyclops (looked
like a big lobster-man with one eye) and the mexican wrestling extras.,
the tale of the midget cannibalistic pirates, the chicken dressed like
little red riding hood dumping bags of corn on the kids, and the band
chewing out audience members for their lack of steelers knowledge.

Very fun - go see them when they come to you'r hometown - its a fun show
even if you don't likes the ska music.

---
Friday circa 11pm - "Exposure" @ the Elks Club

Ok, there's probably nothing more that i can add to this that others
haven't already said.  Overall a very fun rave.  The space was very
nice, but sadly it doesn't look like a place we'll be able to go back to.
Music was good overall...gotta did the TR Generation...excellent stuff
digging down to the basics.  303 + 909 murder!  I was pretty pooped by
tommysunshine's set, but it was really nice to sit and feel the green
electro-spider bass crawlin' over me eardrums.  lovely.

I hope everything turned out well for DNS, because it seemed like they had
to deal with alot more than they expected.  Shouts out to all yins kids -
always glad to see you!! <hugs>  MAJOR PROPS to mr rab for the excellent
badges!  I know everyone didn't get one...hopefully there's more where
they came from??

Saturday - "ricketronica 2" @ mit

Yep you heard it.  I was there.  Even with some bad blood between manny
and the pbs crew, i really had to check this out, because these kind of
acts don't get the kind of support they deserve.  Sat was pretty much
proof of that.  I think i counted ~10 (don't quote me here) people that
were there not affiliated with any of the acts playing (5 in all).  Its
pretty sad.  I understand folks can't always get out to millvale, or have
something personal against the promoter, but its pretty sad when only 10
kids show up on a saturday night.  But whatever.  I have to say, @ $5 this
was the best entertainment for the $'s that i was at this weekend, and
really in a *very* long time.

Because of some tech difficulties, i didn't get to the spot until 9:30, so
i missed the first act, the Joysticks, but i met them between one of the
other acts because they were trying to sell some of their stuff (including
a broken tape, a melted cd, and a petrified duck)  They were a bunch of
highskool kids that looked straight out of revenge of the nerds, and from
what i gathered, their music consisted of fucking with music from
nintendo and atari video games. !!! :)

The first act i got to catch was LEO's OPERATION...i'm pretty sure these
guys are local.  Their setup was a couple roland synths, a bassplayer and
some sequenced beats and samples.  And a vocalist who either sort of
muttered or actually sang on a couple tunes.  Their stuff was really sick
and melodic.  The best way to describe them would be a really distorted
depeche mode.  Sort of an 80's synth feel, but they had alot more
dissonance in their music (well...i think its cause their playing wasn't
so tight on a couple tunes).  Very interesting and different.

The next act was a rap/triphop act called DALEK.  Oh my gosh!  I know kids
on here would have loved these guys.  Their act consisted of 3 guys
from new jersey.  One guy was triggering the beat programming and fucking
with some samples in real-time.  The 2nd was their turntabalist, who cut
in some beats, vocal drops and scratching.  The 3rd was the rapper, who
had mad mad flow dispite the fact that there really wasn't much of an
audience.  Their sound was amazing - rough rough hard beats, but a very
slow tempo (think portishead), and lots of interesting sounds, like
chinese instruments in there. Intellectual/abstract rhymes. The rap
didn't dominate either...there were some parts focusing on the dj and even
some on the programmer (for lack of a better word).  They also did some
instumental style stuff that bordered on noise.  Id say they were much
closer to the triphop portishead style than hiphop.  I picked up their
12", and they have a cd too - i'd really recommend it.

Next was another pgh team....unfortunately i missed their name.  Their
setup was 2 guys, one with a pair of 12's and the other playing some
sequences and doing realtime filtering and sample dropping.  Another
amazing set!!  They started out with some really abstract ambient stuff
that had all kidns of bizzaro images running through my head.  Then they
worked in some hiphop style beats and started going nuts, dropping on
filters and effects, then some jungle beats, and then some noisy
hardcore/gabba stuff.  At that point, you can't really please me any more. 
Off the wall, very nice, as if they know just what i like. I'm going to
try and work with this guy in the future.

Coming on forth were these guys from erie (supposedly one of them used to
throw raves up there) - called PROFESSOR SMALLZ.  :)  One guy was tall and
bald (no it wasn't rich), wore a white jumpsuit, and the coolest thing i'v
ever seen - a tv helmet.  It was the actual shell of a tv, with the crt
punched out and a hole in the bottom so he could were it as a helmet.  He
played some roland synth and some samples.  The other guy was a short dude
with dreads.  He played a moog. He also had it set up (through the
moog?) so when he talked through the mic his voice was magically
'robotized' (exactly like the sound on the new radiohead album).  If you
know me, you know i loves anything with robot voices.   :) They
also had a pretty phat drumtrack running.  Did i mention the short guy
rapped?  In the robo-voice?  These guys were hilarious and good...unique
too...the closest comparison would be beck, but these guys were much more
synth-cutesy.  Again - check these guys out.  I'm looking into booking
them sometime.

The last guy was a lone middle-aged looking' guy, very unassuming, wearing
his N2O chem bros t-shirt, and set up with just a laptop and i think some
kinds of fx box.  But his music was mind-blowing.  Ultra-emotive and
image-inducing powerful ambient-noise.  The sounds were incredibly thick
and psychoactive...i can't even tell you how long his set was, it was that
deep.  I didn't catch the name, but I'm assuming he was Noir Equivalent.

---
Well...that's it.  Spent alot on shows, but that shite was worth any
penny.  Only now I'm not sure what i'm looking forward too.  Ooops, cept
CLARKEE!!  yeah (chef) boyee (r-dee)!!!

this would be touching other than the fact that leland stanford was a

conservative.  *shiver*

oh well, it's the moral of the thing anyway...

frankie g sez: hmmmmm... looks an awful lot like illusions (dust,
kira, tim zelch, and ted zelch all reprezentin' @ both raves) but it's
got dieselboy + jim hopkins so it's gonna be better :) :) it seems
like since twin productions is in on both they would have noticed
that. who is this lenny fontana guy anyways? i'll probably be @ both
cause just about any rave in pittsburgh is a rave worth going to +
they are a month apart.

a few kids asked me awhile back what exactly a Rabbit in
the Moon show was like since they missed out in Cleveland
when David Christopher got in that car accident

here is a short description from the intro of the last 
issue of PLRM...

<<And without a doubt the act that made the party was Rabbit 
in the Moon, one of techno=92s finest live acts.  For me 
witnessing =91Bunnys=92 antics on stage was extra special for 
more reasons than one. When Bunny first appeared he seemed 
so prehistoric, a hairy beast with elongated arms groping 
at the audience. but he was unafraid & he dove into the crowd 
& became one with them. When Bunny appeared next he appeared 
less intimidating, in fact he looked pretty cool in his neon 
blue & orange costume.  He showed the crowd his appreciation 
by tearing open a toy icon of himself & offering the crowd his 
goodies. Then Bunny appeared in a costume composed entirely of 
multiple strands of glow strings. And when he joined with the 
crowd once more, everyone grabbed a piece of him. When he 
appeared again, he was covered from head to toe with a hundred 
little pieces of mirror that refelected all that was around him. 
and when light was cast upon the rabbit, a thousand points of 
light eminated from his body. In his final appearance Bunny 
grabbed an electric sander & continued to grind his face as 
sparks flew in all directions. At first it appeared self 
destructive for him to destroy his own image, but at the end 
everyone realized his sparkleling vision.  

I hope to be remembered as the rabbit & not sitting bull.>>

I thought Motive was an awesome party/rave/event. I felt the vibe was pretty
good. The lights were awesome, and the music was perfect. Later in the
evening I went to the top of the seating area where you could see and hear
everything. To see all those people on the dance floor groovin to great
music w/ funky lights was an experience in itself. I was content watching
that for atleast an hour until that little voice in my head started asking
me "how can you be sitting while this music is playing?"..so I got the hell
up and danced pretty much the rest of the night. Anyways I was impressed.

     nah, tom is incorruptible. he's so plur it's ILL. he
     _was_ dancing, though, so maybe there _were_ some

Now that the Starr report is out, and the worst is known, I've been
hoping that congress would take swift action and then move on with the
business of the country. But it seems our representatives are settling
down for a long process, and I'm not sure I can stand it. Worse, I'm not
sure the country can stand it.

I'm helping launch an Internet campaign to tell our representatives that
we've had enough. The President should receive censure from the Congress
and we should all move on. And the independent counsel investigation
should end. It's time for the public interest to come first, and for our
representatives to show real leadership. 

Will you help? Just go to http://www.moveon.org to sign the petition. It
only takes a minute. And then if you send a message on to your friends
and colleagues, the ball will really get rolling. It's up to us. 

Please feel free to forward this message to anyone you think would be
interested.

     it is. but it happens all the time. i would say
     'natural selection at it's best' but i'm not in
     the mood - alcohol at parties is not a very 
     funny thing.

i talked to brian of sphere at motive (ROB HOOD IS DA SHIT) and he said
that i havent sent him the rom lately.  well i know i have, i missed a week
or 2 awhile back, but he said he hasnt gotten any.
for awhile they didnt have a subject, a minor oversight.  but anyhow, i
later thought that maybe his mail (i think juno?) might limit the size of
the msgs, i mean the rom has gotten big lately.  i think they're running
like 30kb or so.
so .... is anyone having troubles getting the rom, they go out every wed
nite/thu morning.  every week like clockwork, its sent automatically so's i
dont forget  =)

     <sigh>

     just got back from columbus. it's been an 
     interesting weekend. warning: those not 
     inclined to read long messages, just delete
     this right now... :]

     first things first.

     SCJ - hmmm. michele sainte was absent. next SCJ.
     absolut _threw dahn_ in true picksburgh jungle
     style. mad ups the circuit 6 half-posse. frankie
     g was a curfew casualty, unfortunately. sine
     spun - i danced. 'nuff said. please, more people
     show for the next one? shouts to the pittsburgh
     jungle posse in general - and the SCJ residents.

     atomic - well, it was atomic. they seem to blend 
     into one another a little. but deep c's set was
     slamming, altho tommie sunshine wierded me out
     at first. bossa nova? i mean, we are in a club,
     but please. only other thing is that more raver
     kids should show - it was getting way too empty
     in there as concerns vibe. i can't do shouts
     because i can't remember you all and therefore
     i won't. =]

     exposure - this was a decent pittsburgh party.
     i liked the space, but not it's ambience and 
     all the non-scene predjudice it felt like it
     contained. the sound and lights were enough to
     make any of us locals happy - mad props to the cmu
     visuals crew for working the system. the shady sh*t
     that happened about half-way through was painful
     to watch, and really brought me down, especially
     when my friends got all paranoid. i hate to say
     this but that stuff was _not_ friendly. i'm 
     not a big fan of the polizei, but what they did
     was appropriate. other than that - josh.ryan's
     set _rocked_, doran's set was sweet, tr.generation
     slammed the damn floor (big up shaun), and
     tommy sunshine was a little less strange than
     at atomic altho i have to give him SERIOUS props
     for what he said at the end - i knew the pittsburgh
     kids were the best :]. b.dee spun a more contemplative
     set than the previous night, but it was an 
     excellent ending. big up DNS for the party, hope
     all goes well for you. you have my respect, sympathy
     and support, for what it's worth. shouts to: tom cox
     on his birthday (19 has been an interesting year
     for me so far...), geoff, john, jbrick, kelly, andy
     the pooh, andy the brew, dori (*hug*), josh ryan,
     frankie g, don (of course), spike, liquid the
     plurry candyraver, steve ford, erika, mskw1, 
     jenifer (*hug*) and i bet like a whole bunch of
     people i forgot. 

     motive - where the [insert word of choice] were
     all these kids at sky-high? the place was packed.
     the vibe was slow, thick, and confused. beltram
     no-showed. the lights and sound were by far the
     best i've seen since IGC, props to eyegasm, WWS,
     and the col. sound crew. this would have been the
     _perfect_ party to chill on the bleachers while
     tripping. however, i didn't figure that out until
     rather too late, plus i would never think of 
     doing anything like that :]. i have to say that 
     the only set i really _enjoyed_ was rob.hood's,
     which was slamming. otherwise there was too
     much going on to concentrate. we got there a 
     little late due to my friends getting sidetracked
     before-hand, but got there about an hour after the
     doors opened anyway. complaint: this party was
     too short by any measure. 6.5 hours is _half_
     as long as a rave this size should be. the price
     was excellent, i thought (15 w. canned good as
     i recall) for the lights/sound and lineup.
     shouts to: braden, matt, benny (you _were_
     yourself ;), avantgod, andy the pooh (again),
     trouty, jade, rich/downlow, don, amanda and
     eric (you disappeared?) and some other new kids
     my tired brain failed to fully register. i suck,
     i know =P.

     well, i think that's about it as far as reviews
     go. later, and stuff.

	Hey kiddies, this is a post about a party that took place in West Virginia
this weekend. I will do my best to give u the most accurate feel of the party
as possible, but i think thats kinda a difficult task. 
	On Saturday afternoon about 3 pm, Niles, Ky and I set out on our journey to
Harrisville, WV. We took a long but very scenic and beautiful drive there (a
bit over 5 hours) from Silver Spring, MD and arrived close to 9pm that night.
When we got there we were greeted by a row of adorable ravers lining the small
bridge we needed to cross to get to the party area. We all exchanged
introductions and then headed up to set up our campsite. After setting up the
camp, we wandered around checking out the site. My goodness, it was LOVELY.Try
to imagine hills and trees and wildflowers growing as far as the eye can see.
In my opinion, it was heaven. We walked around and began meeting more and more
people. This is when the true party really began for all of us. Its so hard
for me to explain what took place there that night but whatever it was , it
was magic. EVERYTHING fell into place. The music was outstanding, the people
were the NICEST most GENUINE , INSPIRATIONAL, INTELLIGENT people i've ever
come into contact with. I'm not just talking about people from West VA. There
were people all the way from Missouri (can u say, ELEVEN hour drive?!), Ohio,
Pittsburgh, DC, god, i can't even remember where else. Everyone was dancing
and talking and hugging and taking pictures of each other. We felt like a big
family, the way raves are SUPPOSED  to feel. I wish i could make u understand
what i'm saying. There was NONE of the bullshit attitude there. NOT ONE PERSON
gave off a sketchy vibe. This is what happens when a bunch of people who
really RESPECT the scene get together. I want each of you to experience this
but in your own time. If you are in the scene because you think its cool or
you think its a good way to get drugs or earn some money, you don't know what
this is about and i suggest you leave now because we don't want you in our
scene. Our scene is about love and music and unity, not about you and your
greed. 	
	As the night went on, I remember feeling very tired but i couldn't bring
myself to go to sleep, we were having too good a time and didn't want to miss
a beat. Count Zero ( from DCraves, i do believe!) played an amazing set that
got everyone dancing and woke all our asses up. Also Teak , Beck and Dr
Jesus(NEraves) spun wonderfully. I believe there were some other djs and i
apologize for not recalling their names. In the early morning hours a DAT of
Dubtribe performing was put on and we all went crazy. 
	I know i'm leaving out a lot of stuff, its so hard to organize my thoughts
with so much jumping around in my brain. I know that i didn't do this party
justice with the review i wrote but its very difficult to put into words what
took place Saturday night. It was unreal, mystical, magical. It shouldn't even
really be considered a party, this was an EXPERIENCE that i will be telling my
grandchildren about ,years and years from now. 	
	Here's a quick shoutout to everyone who attended and contributed their vibe
to this event. I love you all and please keep in touch with me. I hope to be
seeing each of you very soon. BIGGG HUGS to : LOVELAB SOUNDSYSTEMS, Niles,
Amber, Gabrielle, David (for telling me about the party in the first place),
Jed, Netica, Denise, Jamie, Martha and Paul, Ronnie, Donnie, Costa and if i
forgot anyone ( which i KNOW i did, by accident, of course!) i'm very sorry
and remember that vibe doesn't just happen, its created by each of us. 
*LOVE and BIGG BIGG BIGG HUGZ*

     well, i really wanted to work these thoughts
     into my reviews, but it risked becoming an 
     unfathomable tome, and nobody likes those...

     please, don't read if you aren't comfortable
     with what might be a painfully close look at the
     scene through the eyes of someone who may think
     too much. but i need to say this. also note that
     none of this may have happened, and nothing i say
     in any way reflects on the integrity or legitimacy
     of those organizing raves.

     <contemplative>

     david schwanke's email made me think, more than
     just a little. not because of the implications
     of his complaints of physical endangerment - i
     have few problems in that area - but because i
     know schwanke, not well, but certainly enough to
     care. david's intelligent, and he knows what he's
     doing - and that's why he's backing off. his
     coherent warning wasn't fun to read.

     there is such a thing as too much. there is
     such a thing as an optimum dosage. and there
     may, just may, be a point where personal 
     enjoyment crosses the line into personal 
     endangerment.

     please don't cross this line, where-ever it
     may be.

     or at least, don't cross it and never come 
     back.

     and, please, please, don't hurt those around
     you when you should be just hurting yourself.

     those of you who know virtually anything about
     the rave scene know very well that it's not
     just underground because of the music we play.
     and those of you who know virtually anything
     about myself know that i don't mind that, not
     as much as i should, maybe.

     things got scary this weekend, once or twice. 
     not vicious, like fantasia 4, but just confused,
     dark, and a little strange at times.

     there's something that's been bothering me,
     and it took me 'till this weekend to lay my 
     finger on it, or come close.

     i'm not sure i entirely like what i've become.

     there's a set of values that i grew up with,
     and a mindset in which i spent a decade or
     longer. these values have been _viciously_
     compromised in less than a year, and this
     mindset has been shattered many, many times
     in far less time than that...

     i may have become a more complete, happier,
     and more interesting person.

     i may also have lost the closest part of my
     family, the respect of some close friends, and
     made several decisions that i may end up 
     regretting, not decisions that hurt badly,
     but small decisions that i didn't think about
     until after i _should_ have thought about them.

     is this the way it's supposed to be? am i 
     missing something? is the pain of emotional
     loneliness fucking with my brain? somebody
     pick up the damn phone and talk to me...

     i saw some things this weekend i would have
     given almost anything not to see. the scared,
     blanched and choking face of a kid at exposure
     who stupidly killed the vibe, can't have done 
     anything to enhance the reputation of the
     scene, and probably gave the promoters a sick
     headache that they won't forget for a while.
     the wide eyes of a cute girlie at motive who
     had been up for three days on crystal. a girl
     at motive who couldn't have been more than
     fifteen who kept jumping around telling 
     everyone that would listen that it was 'her 
     first party and her first roll and ohmygod
     isn't it wonderful...' shouldn't she be at
     home watching after hours or something?

     i think a person's conciousness needs time
     to set, solidify, and comprehend _before_
     it is ready for the full implications of
     the rave experience. but that's just me.
     i'm not going to tell you who to bring to
     parties, and what to feed them.

     anyway...

     sotto voce: 'no disrespect, man.'

     it's not really anything to do with maturity
     per se, but more with understanding, of 
     consequences and possibilities and all the
     implications of that first stanza of the
     american constitution.

     i know how i was when i was sixteen.

     i also know how ecstacy feels, the wild rush of
     happy abandon, the strange sense of universal 
     understanding, as fleeting and undefinable as
     a dream. then there's the warm curling tickle of an 
     opiate around the base of your skull, the burning
     tingle in the top of your brain, the entranced 
     high from inside which you look out at a world
     bathed with a golden glow. and the evil happiness
     of crystal, the raw energy, the burning
     septum, the angry adrenaline dance.

     and quite frankly, the thought of the first
     with any of the last (and others) scares me 
     shitless.

     but i'm a wimp.

     right?

     something like that. but sometimes i wish i was
     just a little more scared. i think i have reason
     to be. take care of yourself, okay? because 
     sometimes the people you thought were your best
     friends won't take care of you, not because they
     don't care, but because they don't know.

     </contemplative>

     sorry for the long and moody post. but it's 
     there, and i'm not sorry. make of it what you
     will.

     *hugs*

tell you what, i noticed that thing about plastilina mosh playing a show=
 with dj spooky in columbyus or osmething, but it really kinda bugged me=
 out, cuz we got a couple copies of the new plastilina mosh cd in the radio=
 station at the end o f the summer when we came back to school and it didn't=
 seem to have anything to do with dance/hip/hop/whatever you would think=
 would be booked to play with spooky and ebn.  i really ought to take a=
 listen to that cd sometime and figure out what the deal is, i'll let you=
 know my opinionn...sorry my typing is atrocious right now.  however, i do=
 have the new dj spook and have listened to it a bunch...and i like it very=
 much.  it is amazinly diverse...it has some great hip hop tracks in the=
 vein of dj shadow as well as somer really decent gritty drum and bass=
 tracks.  there is plenty of his trademark crazy sampling and backward=
 spinning of vinyl, etc.  his show ought to be really interesting..i have a=
 disc from him that was recorded live on some Microsoft Network OnAir=
 broadcast he did, and it starts out totally ambient/noise but eventually=
 comes around to some decent hip hop turntablism with some fierce scratching=
 by peanut butter wolf.  and of course he manages to mix in the strangest of=
 80s music, and other random stuff.  i think it ought to be an intersting=
 show,regardless of what plastilina mosh sounds like , but as i said, i'll=
 try to let you know what that's like when i get a chance to listen to it.

WAY too crowded, I couldn't dance for more than 5 minutes or I felt as
if I would pass out.  I felt sick part of the night, and every time I
had to walk up stairs I almost blacked out.  I thought the music was
best around 1/1:30-ish, whoever was spinning then, I don't know.  

Before we actually got inside I walked with a friend down the street
to this country western bar so she could use the bathroom, and on my
way back running across the 4-lane street in front of the school where
the party was I tripped (!) on my fucking huge ass pants and am now
all banged and scraped to hell.  It hurts way more today too.  I
suppose this either makes me really hard-core or just an even bigger
nerd.

Actually, I thought the netmeet was the best part of the night, since
I met a bunch of people I had never met before.  It was funny seeing
Mr. Rab because I had actually met him months and months ago at Tribe
back before he was on the list, so that was cool.  (Hey -- thanks for
the pb-cle laminate thingie.) 

Geekboy -- sorry Erik and I disappeared for most of the night, but I
really, really was not feeling well and spent a lot of time hanging
out by the main room air conditioner.

Shouts to all the net people I met -- Benny and Matt, you guys are CUTE!

I'll see a bunch more of you next week at Submerged.

Anyone going/coming to Red Zone this weekend to see Lars? I heard he sucks.
What kind of music does he play? Other than "Real World" and hearing that
"he sucks" I don't know anything about him, so Im really curious.

#PB-CLE-RAVES
* * * * * * * * * * * *
I will be posting this to the list every month or two as a reminder.

IRC is an internet based chat system - much more intense than AOL, Prodigy,
Compuserve, etc chat rooms.

There are a number of us who hang out quite regularly on #pb-cle-raves
(EFnet), so if you feel inclinded please stop in to say hi -- or just hang
out there.
DaNcErBot, Moonshine, and Poo-bas are bots, so don't bother talking to them
as they will not talk back -- well maybe sometimes ;)
If you would like to see who is on the channel, then
http://erienet.net/~circle/pb-cle-raves/ will show you.

Make sure your on EFnet... not one of the other IRC networks.
Below I have included some basic IRC information!

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
HOW DO I GET ON IRC
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
- IRC is way of chatting through the internet, free of aol chatrooms,
hotline, instant messengers, etc.

- IRC is composed of many inter-connected "servers".  The servers exchange
information.   You (as a chatter) need a "client" (program) to connect to a
server.  Many different clients are available, depending on the OS (mac,
*nix, windows) you use.

- Many different IRC clients are available depending on your platform.  For
windows, mIRC is pretty much the standard, but pIRCh is my client of choice.
I like pirch because
it has a better GUI (graphical interface) and it is easier to use.
pIRCh can be downloaded here: http://www.bcpl.lib.md.us/~frappa/pirch.html
mIRC can be downloaded here:
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/6000/
I don't know about mac, but I believe that IRCle is the program you are
looking for.

-  Now that you know a bit about IRC, you need to understand that there are
different networks.   Dalnet, Efnet, Undernet, IRCnet, etc.   There are
litteraly over a 1000 different IRC servers, but you have to use one on the
network your friends are using.   Efnet is the most popular widely used
network.   There are over 10,000 people connected at one time to over 30
different servers.

-  How do you find a server, you may ask.   This was one of the problems I
had as an IRC newbie.   I have since created a fairly
popular webpage that updates the Efnet server list every four hours.  It can
be found at http://www.erienet.net/~circle/links.html

-  For additional information, you can check out http://www.irchelp.org/ or
you can check out the IRC section of my personal web site
http://www.cybrtown.com/~burky

- There were two things that plauged me as a beginning IRC user.   One was
the use of IDENT, and the other was lag.
IDENT.  If you see a message about INSTALL IDENT, that simply means you need
to enable that feature in your pirch or mirc client.   Its a way of the
server
to determine the "name" of your computer.   It is in you best interest to
make your IDENT something obscure.
LAG.   With a network such as Efnet, it takes awhile for information to get
from here to there.   Usually the lag is around 2 seconds.   However,
servers do have problems, and tend to split or get lagged.  You can PING
another user to determine your lag.  If you join a channel and don't see
what your expecting, then the server you are using is probably "split".  A
split is a seperation from the rest of the network.

Hey everyone... 
I just finished updating my web site. For those of you who don't know it, it
is a site listing the raves/parties and club events for United States and
Canada. It had been awhile since I updated it, for most regions of the U.S.
and Canada, but it's all current now, and the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
Michigan/Illinois/Midwest pages are pretty well stocked now. 
Visit when ya get a chance, and let me know if I am missing something (I know
that some parts could use info), party/rave or club-wise. 

http://expage.com/page/egroove  

Hope to catch some of you Friday at Trilogy for DJ Hardware, or Sunday at U4ia
for the Moonshine Tour with DJ Dan, John Kelley, Micro, Cirrus, and Jim
Masters!!! Anyone else going to either of these? Email me and let me know...we
can get a list started!! Whoo~hoo!!!! ;-) (yeah I'm a geek)... Peace! Casey

In a message dated 98-09-28 19:48:22 EDT, you write:

<< i think a person's conciousness needs time
      to set, solidify, and comprehend _before_
      it is ready for the full implications of
      the rave experience. but that's just me.
      i'm not going to tell you who to bring to
      parties, and what to feed them. >>

VERY WELL SAID and I highly agree.  Raves in general are like any other scene.
You shouldn't just jump right into them.  You wouldn't go to a death metal
show and try to "fit in" your first time there.  One should get a feel for the
crowd and then decide if that scene is right for them.  

Well said Geekboy
Well said......

let me just start this review of by saying that this party was one of the
most amazing experiences of my life...

in case you kids dont already know, EQUINOX:The Gathering is an outdoor
party that happens once a year on a farm in West Virginia. Although i had
heardd about it via the net (which included very detailed directions and
stuff) it really is an event that is not promoted for too intensly.. so if
you have heard about this party, and you do actually make it out it means ..
well i dont know exactly waht it means... but its something special....

although i had intended to go to EXPOSURE in pittsburgh on friday nite,
David (the spy) got it into my head that Virginia was the cooler option
(after all, a party like EXPOSURE is just like every other pittsburgh
party... but EQUINOX is something special... and it only happens but once a
year...

so at abt 12:30 on friday David, Donny, John and myslef all pile into
David's car and head for West Virginia w\ door to door instructions curtisey
of map-quest... unfortunaely, we ran into some drama w\ the pittsburgh
police at the begginning of our adventure... we ran a stop sign... which we
shouldnt have done... so that held us up a while... but after abt 20 minutes
we were off... and we were really in the mood for to party...

the directions said that the party was 150+ miles away.. so we figured we'd
make it in about 2 hrs... or less... unfortunately, when u get to  the
backwoods of west virginia, you cant do 80 on the little dirt road w\ curves
and cliffs etc.. taht would be just stupid... we also got kind of lost along
the way b/c we were being all crazy in the car and no one was really paying
attention...also... a funny thing about drt roads.. they seldom  -- if
ever -- have signs... so u never really know taht u are on the right road...
also.. it seemed like we were the only car in the entire fucking state..
another fear.. every time we wrongly entered into people's property, we were
afraid some farmer dude was gonna come after us w\ a shot-gun... i mean, we
were all candied out... lots of candy-jewelery and blue hair... never mind
the big pants... and it was like 4:00 by the time we got to the party...

anyway... the "space" of this party was KICK ASS... a farm in west
virginia... that was list mostly by candle-light (although they do have
electricity)  and spearated from the road by a wooden bridge.. just crossing
that bridge in itslef was an amzing experience b/c of all the expectations
when one has right b4 getting to a party.. except, this wasnt just a matter
pof walking through the doors.. you had to cross a bridge.. which made it
all the more symbolic...

the bad thing was taht at 4:00AM it was kind of hard to fumiliarize oneself
w\ the surrounding area... and it was even more siprising to see the actual
space by the light of day.. it was even more beautiful tahn i had
emagined...

the first posotive thing was the music... they had an actual sound system
set up and lots of capable dj;s.. although no "superstar" dj;s were there...
still i was expecting something TOTALLY different... i wasnt even sure
they'd be spinning "techno"... but thankfully, there was some really great
music and all the dj's spun for FREE... yeiii...!!

the event itself was basically free.. although we gave them some money so
that they could take care of certain expenses etc...

the vibe was the most amazing one i have ever seen... there were not THAT
many people there at all.. but tahts what made this so amazing... on the
first evening of festivities (friday) there wer only abt 20 of us there...
but since satarday nite was the main nite, they wer expecting a bigger turn
out on satarday... personally, i didnt care... and i felt like i developed a
personal relationship w\ everyone there...

there were people from all over... missouri, dc, seattle, philly, various
towns in ohio, pittsburgh, ny, and california, and some other places...
these kids are some of the most down ravers i have ever met... i mean.. we
all knew what the deal was.. these were real party kids.. w\ a true respect
for the scene and all the ideals that it stands for... not just crackheads
and tourists who go b/c its cool...no no, these kids were ALL down...i cant
even descrivbe the vibe in words.. it was like a paradise of ravers...
AMAZING... absolutely increadible...

shade wasnt even an issue... no one tried to sell me drugs... no one stared
me up and down.. everyone was smiling, hugging, kissing, telling stories...
there was a bonefire a few yards away from the main dancing area w\ a path
taht was lit by candles... and we all sat around there for a while and just
exchanged experiences and toys and candy and mdae candy jewelery for each
other...

as the sun came out, we realised what an amzing place this party was at..
the most beautiful scenery ... for all you Art Historty buffs out there, i
happen to be studying Romanticism... and this landscape was like the perfect
subject for romanticist painting.. the sense of awe that we felt just
running around the space... there were hay stacks everywhere, lots of green
foliage... even the fucking mud was picuresque and beautiful... also for
some reason it was very foggy.. which really added to the magic of the
space... we just sat there for a while looking at the erd sun of the
sunrise... beautiful.. donny, the group photogapher has taken lots of
photos.. i'll try to scan some of them in the next couple weeks... and
although i have no web page, i'm sure i can fnd smwhere to post them...

unfortunately, we had intended on staying only a few hrs.. (and returning to
EXPOSURE in the morning...) so we didnt bring camping supplies and stuff..
but we decided to go back to pittsburgh and crash (while everyone else
crashed in tents and stuff) and then return satarday evening for the main
nite... we each had work and stuff to take care of so it really had to
happen...


anyway.. we returned on satarday evening around one... and everyonew as SO
happy to see us.. bc even tho the plan was to go back.. we had some trouble
finding a ride back (Dave was cool enough to let us take the car again...
thanks dave :D) so it wasnt sure taht we'd make it back....

u have no idea what its like to get bombarded by hugs when people see u at
the party... everyone started bouncing off the cieling when they saw us...
Satarday nite was a basic repeat of friday nite only that attendance had
basically doubled.. there were abt 50 people there i;d say... and they were
just as happy, vibey and friendly as everyone esle...

respect where it is due...

gabrielle... this girl is the person who is most repsonsable for this
event,,, not only is she a totally dope girl, but she puts this thing
together every year, she makes her own cloths and jewlery...(she had her own
booth at sunrise festival in baltimore couple weeks ago... )
and she is a great friend...

lauren... a philly raver babe.. who isnt sure abt her partying status.,. for
making me understand how hard it s to be a party kid in philly... we talked
abt K.. and how it is responsible for lots of the drama in both our lives
and how ... the philly scene sucks.. and that no one is happy there.. and
how we gotta bring the vibe back to philly... another great friend...

Summer and Emily... my biggest fans at this party... we group hugged all
nite long and danced and coudled and were so happy to see each other . i
think emily started crying when i left... which is not a positive thing per
se.. but it shows that she was really affected by what was going on around
her and that me being there did really mean something to her...

Jon... the dude w\ the coolest set of the evening... even tho i hate
house,,, this was good house... also.. he looked like the biggest hardass at
the party ... so when he reasched over the dj booth and gave me a big ass
hug i sat there bewildered and confused and wasnt sure waht was  going on...
i was way condused... also.. he had the cutest little teletubie (sp??)
doll... this dude was no hardass... he was one of the vibest party kids
ever...

Malissa and Joe... 2 people we did not expect so see... and yet somehow knew
that they would make it out.. these kids are at every midwest party.. theres
no reason to think they;d miss this one (excpet taht there was another big
party in cleveland ohio on satarday nite...)

rollrgirl<---w\ out the e b/c she ate it :D ... and co... these kids drove
out all teh way from dc... and are some fo the happiest kids ever.. and they
add nothing bot positivity to the experience... cool seeing u again honey!!

Amber.. on who's house/farm/land teh party was held.. what a cool girl... i
had spent lots of time rolling around in the grass and was really REALLY
filthy come satarday morning and she offereed to let me into her house to
wash up.. even tho the house itself was off linits to most kids.. i declined
b/c i didnt want to impose... and we were getting ready to head abck to
pittsburgh anyway.. so i would be able to clean up in my own home instead...

Donny and John... always the happy party kids.. thanks for the company.. for
the food... for the love.. i hope u 2 kids can get your god damn act
together at some point and stop fighting so much...

David.. yeiii... thank you davie... for dragging me to west virginia and
allowing me to experience such a worderful weekend... being my partying
buddy is hard fucking work.. but somehow i know u can deal... imagine how
much fun we can have together.. much love and thanks.. for everything.

anyway kids.. taht was my long winded review of the gathering.. intend to
return to every subsequent gathering from now on.. (we've all made a pact to
return it seems.. and i intend to keep that promis...) i came away w\ so
much from this party,.. in many ways it was the ideal partying experience..
it was ecerything a party could and should be and i hope that you kids get a
chance toe cperience something like this at some point.. b/c this party is
what the scene is all about.

xoxo for now,

Costas.

Lars from the Real World?  I thought he was trying to be a promoter.  I
suppose fame has improved his djing skills.

hey, im down in atlanta at the moment (more on that in another post), 
and i just thought i'd let you know that i saw david christopher on 
saturday night at my friends radio show (ga tech. wrek, its one of the 
biggest college stations in the country..somewhere in the top ten i 
think...40,000w transmitter, quarter million listeners)....anyway, david 
showed up in the studio, and i want to verify that yes he did have a leg 
brace/splin on (one of those ones that have like a flat wooden sole and 
blue cloth sides) and he seemed to be in good health...so to everyone 
who was worried. hes fine.


atlanta? dope town...i saw dj craze [current us dmc champ-- makes last 
years champ (slyce) look like a chump...which slyce was anyway in the 97 
world competitions (he lost to a-trak from mtl] and dj faust (amazing dj 
from atl.) rock the spot so thoroughly i caught myself spontaneously 
throwing my hands in the air :) craze was sooooo ill -- he broke down 
this one (straight) beat so precisely, and then built it back up 
again...this time as a breakbeat...badass, he also dropped some dope 
house tracks, and apparently spun a jungle set after i left..wish i 
coulda caught it...jungle in atlanta? 

hmm i've run into adam darby (ninjakid, ex cmu student) and caught a few 
shows...atl seems to be about a year behind what im used to...its not 
bad, cause i like jump-up...but damn. i havent really been impressed by 
much down here...big respect to my pgh and cleveland boys who make every 
set sound so smooth. you know who you are...i have been cringing because 
im hearing most every mix (CANT YOU HEAR THAT ITS A BAD MIX??)....and 
they play shit slooooooowwww down here...between -2 and +4 (+4 is 
cranking it up)...wierd.

so the drum n bass scene needs work. but i think it will get much better 
in the very near future ;)  alot of the djs here are (SNAP JUDGEMENT 
ALERT) total posers. cant mix two beats, but look perfect in their old 
school adidas shoes and track suits. boy you look good. and those battle 
breaks records are COOL! and hey, can you scratch a record back and 
forth? YOU'RE A DJ!! *heh* 'nuff said. ;)

but the good totally and completely outweighs the bad. case in point: 
tomorrow in athens ga (1hr from atlanta) ill be checking out prince paul 
for $5. :) and then herbie hancock is performing in a few weeks at the 
theatre about a block from here. two record store (rewind...bobble's 
store, and satellite, where tommy sunshine is at) within walking 
distance...its pretty nice... atlanta is dope. 3.5 mil ppl so its big 
but not nasty, lots of 20-30 year olds who go out and are social and 
like to stay out late (things dont close at 2am here)...very tech-savvy 
place, and most of all ITS WARM. woo ha.

i want to thank everyone who went out to exposure and had a good 
time...i really wish i could have gone to support derek and shannon, but 
things didnt work out. please continue to attend their events in the 
future. i've known them both as friends for a while now, and they are 
really really decent ppl. big up.

well, i next plan on being at ride the rhythm in cleve. on oct 9...come 
up and say hi and ill give you a shout out...:) all crews will get 
represented. 

the twins party is in pgh that same nite, so if you go to that, have 
fun...you def. will enjoy it...

but if you decide on cleveland, you will hear some really really dope 
music [jungle and old school and hh and techno from mastervibe and 
clarkee (uk), sick ass ghetto house from urban (chicago), kevin and 
alex/tik tak with the drum and the bass, and my boy tigger with bouncy, 
driving house :) you cant lose either way. (lenny fontana should drop a 
really dope house set).

thats it for now, drop me a line and say what's up :)

peace,
hossam

     okie, so that's where you were. i really

DAY ONE...

part one 

FRANKIE BONES - East Coast Founding Father

--(begin clip from interview from Static issue #3 may/june 1998)--

FRANKIE BONES: Well, basically I've been involved in the American 
rave scene since it started and it definitly started in LA.  In 
late'89 they started breaking into warehouses in LA.  All their 
information came from Europeans, mostly English people, who
would go there to visit and tell people, who would go there to
visit and tell people about these massive parties that were 
going on in England.  I was involved in the summer of love in
the tail end of '88 and it blew up in '89.  I was there in August
and the first party I did was called "Energy" and it had 25,000
people at it.  This party was only supposed to have 5,000 people
at it.  They booked me for 5,000 and I remember thinking when
I got on the plane that all I ever wanted to be was the biggest
DJ in NY and 5,000 people would easily overshadow anything 
that was going on in NY because the biggest parties in NY at 
the time were like 3,000 and they weren't raves - they were 
clubs like Palladium.  I remember when we were driving we 
saw parked cars everywhere!  Just littered across the country
side!  I wound up playing to 25,000 people that night and at 
that point I didn't know what raving or ecstacy was.  Anyway,
these people would go to LA and talk about what was going on
and I was in the first wave of parties that happened in LA. I
got booked from playing in London.  When I landed in LA, I 
wasn't from NY - I was from London as far as they were 
concerned.  I lived in London bi-weekly.  All the people I was
involved with in NY would fly over with me like Lenny Dee and
Joey Beltram, who were under my wing at the time.  They just
wanted to go overseas to get to see it.  All I kept talking 
about was how I wanted to do it in America.  People in NY would 
be like "Bones is crazy, he's out of his fucking mind.  He 
doesn't realize it's a European thing and it'll never happen in 
America." I remember going to LA and "Stranger than Fiction" 
was the first big party in the Shrine Auditorium is real glitzy.  
That's where they do the Oscars for Grammy and it really wasn't 
a rave.  It was a party and the people that were there didn't 
really understand.  Then we started breaking into warehouses and 
that was the vibe.   We were in this egg warehouse, it was where 
they manufactured eggs, and it was abandoned.  Ron D. Core and 
it must've been DJ Dan, but I don't know for sure, had two sets 
of turntables like, right up against each other, and each DJ 
would look at each other while they were playing.  They were like, 
"We call this 2x4!"  I was amazed!  I'd never heard of that 
before!  I'm looking around the warehouse and I ask the promotor 
"How'd you get this space?" and they were like "We just got a 
lock clipper, we clipped the locks!" (Laughs).
STATIC: Did it get busted?
BONES: Yeah it did actually, I was sitting with Ron showing him
how to take duct-tape and put it on the center of the turntable,
lay the record on it, flip the needle upside down, pull the 
weight back, and play the record backward.  Ron was just amazed 
by that as I was by the whole 2x4 set-up!   Right while we're 
sitting there all buggin' out the cops come in and shut it down.  
I remember leaving there and tellin' those guys "I'm going to do 
this in NY because in NY I got places I can break into that the 
cops won't get to,"  and they were all like "Yeah!  Do it!  Do 
it!  let us know what happenes!"  the NY party scene started 
exactly one year after LA.  The only thing was that LA never had 
the culture with the music.  NY always had it.  People will say 
house started in Chicago, or techno started in Detroit, but NY had 
it all along.  House is just a variation of NY bass or electro, 
so we always had the music here  We started with small parties 
in apartments because I wasn't going to break into a warehouse 
right off the bat!  I had to do my homework, you know.  Alot of 
my friends from the UK would come over and they would see the 
potential.  I never wanted any part of the drug  trafficking or 
drug trade, but the first E landed in NY just before the scene 
got going.  They brought it over, like 2000 pills, and gave 1000 
to the club kids in Manhatten and gave 1000 to the Brooklyn kids 
just to break the scene because they wanted to see what would 
happen.  In a matter of 6 months we went from 15 kids in an 
apartment with a set of turntables and a strobe light to 5000 
people at Storm Rave.  We did these parties every week and they 
kept getting bigger and better, Storm Raves started out in a ware
house, well, it wasn't really a warehouse, it was a warehouse but 
in the back it was kind of like a brickyard.  I cut a hole in a 
fence that was by some railroad tracks, and made people park 
their cars 6 blocks away and walk down the tracks with flashlights.  
I'd have one guy by the hole in the fence holding a flashlight.  
We got about 300 people in there.  That was an amazing party 
because we didn't even rent a generator.  We climbed up a lamp 
post and tapped the light for electricity.  So 6:30 comes around 
and the sun comes up and the sensor shuts the lights off and that 
was it.   We didn't think of that as we were tapping the light!  
The next week we rented a generator and that party went until 
about 4:00 in the afternoon.  I have tapes of Hardkiss, Doc Martin, Richie
Hawtin, and Josh Wink all playing at our early parties.  
People look at NY and think it's all Bones and Adam X - all 
hardcore, but we were down with everybody.  It was all about DJ 
culture to me and as the rave thing grew, we had some of the best parties, and
when Storm Rave blew up anybody who was there will 
tell you there was nothing like it.  LA was getting the 10,000 
people, but they were so commercial.  Our staff was just raw ware
house vibe.  I had friends handle lights.  I had people who 
invested, and I had a gangster guy who took care of the mafia 
because I'd run into some heavy situations with gangsters who 
thought I was trying to take over the club scene.
STATIC: what they do?
BONES: I got wacked in front of my house and left for dead.  I 
got hit in the head with a baseball bat and had 96 stitches in 
my head.  I got hit with the bat 3 times and pistol-whipped once.  
Once the police found out what raves were it was all over.  Once 
I actually told the police the party was a video shoot for my new 
record.  I pulled a record out of my bag and it had my name on it.  
The cop actually knew the record!  At the time it had been on the 
radio and the cop had heard of the record and asked me for the 
record!  I signed it for him and and the party went on all night!

DAY ONE...

part two

RON D CORE - west coast founding father

--(begin clip from Static #3 may/june 1998 Ron D Core interview)--

STATIC: So you've been DJ'ing forever, pretty much...
CORE: Yeah, I think since before the dinosaurs were here, 
something like that.  No, it's been about twelve years now.
STATIC: What were you playing back then?
CORE: The earliest stuff was like industrial, like Meat Beat, 
23 Skido - that kind of stuff.  There was a little bit of 
everything.  Acid House,
maybe some of the earlier workings of techno.  Really early 
chicago techno
STATIC: So when did hardcore come into the picture?
CORE: As far as what's considered hardcore...probably '93 is 
when it sort of went hardcore.  That's when Rotterdam came 
about and started making those faster records that most people, 
I think, were kind of scared of.   That's the kind of record 
that made (DJ) Dan go funky and stay that away, and made me go 
"this stuff's really cool".  That was a good year, as far as 
total change, for everyone.  It was down time for the scene, 
but it was great for music.
STATIC: Well, what's it runnin' now around 280 BPM?
CORE: Around there, yeah.  I mean I'll peak out like up to 300.
STATIC: That's nuts.  That's like double speed of Detroit 
techno stuff.
CORE: Yeah, that's why I can play those old records in on the 
half time. They're totally at half time.  See, I can still 
revive old records!  Not in the way people would probably want 
to hear them, but what the heck.
STATIC: So what's the difference between Rotterdam and Gabber 
stuff?
CORE: (sarcastically) Genres.  There's a big family from 
hardcore. Gabber is obviously from Holland, it's sort of a name 
they came upwith on their own.  It's got more of the bouncier 
sound, with a lot of sped up, like Smurf sounding samples.  It's 
really cartoony.   A lot of kids over here call it Partycore.  
That's sort of the new nick name they've given it.  It's really 
happy and, sort of, gay sounding (immature snickering by all).  
Then there's breakcore.  It's sort of where Happy hardcore and 
jungle, sort of met.  Just recently distorted hardcore. It's not 
super popular, but it's something new.  And  then there's the 
other stuff, like Speedcore, Terrorcore, Deathcore, and there's 
so many derivatives.   Pretty much it all means the same thing to 
me. Just fast, angry, and crazy music.  That stuff, to me, is 
like 240 to 300 BPM.  There's even someone in San Diego trying 
to come up with Ambient Gabber.  There is a record lable "Ambient Gabber".  I
have 
it in the store - it hasn't sold yet, but I have it.
STATIC: How did you and (Simply) Jeff hook up to do your shop?
CORE: Through DMC.  We both worked at DMC Records.
STATIC: The place that Vitamin D was spying on, right? (Inside 
story about Vitamin D being fired for crazy reasons)
CORE: All of us were spys, really.  That's why they got rid of 
us.  I had met Jeff on a few occasions before that, but really 
got to know each other when I got him a job at DMC.  We car 
pooled every day together. He knew I wanted to do a store on my 
own.  We eventually started talking about a partnership, and we 
came up with the idea of myself, him, and Helen (Ron's wife) 
splitting it three ways.  We told Larry (DMC) to take a flying 
leap, and we started our own shop.
STATIC: What's up with the magazine section of your store?
CORE: What part of it? The naughty ones?
STATIC: Yeah, the 18 & up adult section
CORE: The family classics. Um...my idea, of course.  I appreciate 
goodporn.  It doesn't sell like...it's not flying out the door, 
but it is slowly selling.  We do sell some of it.  Not as much as 
High Times or Muzik or DJ, but it's catching on.  A lot of kids
appreciate seeing it there.
STATIC: Obviously you're pretty blatant about enjoying porn, with
your tape covers and whatever...
CORE: Very open about it.
STATIC: Do you think you're influencing some of these kids to 
become interested in the whole porn thing?
CORE: Yeah, why not?  I support pornography.  I think it's a 
great business.  To me it's a lot like the undergound scene.   
They have a lot of similarities.  They're both seedy in their 
own way, and have a nice big following.
STATIC: And they have a lot of trashy girls (and guys)
CORE: Yeah, trashey women.  We have trashey women that are 
under 18, and they have trashy women that are over 18
STATIC: So who do you rate in the porn world? Who's the shit?
CORE: Oh, Ron Jeremy, of course, is the shit.  He's the king.
STATIC: What about Peter North?
CORE: Peter North...eh, he's too plastic looking.  He looks 
like Josh Wink without hair (laughter) Seriously, if you put 
dreads on Peter North, you've got Josh Wink
STATIC: Maybe he's leading a double life, Josh Wink takes his 
dreads off and goes out and makes movies
CORE: Oh God.  On the female side, there's not really anyone 
in particular I really like.  It's just, I more or less follow 
the Asian porn stars.   They're my favorites.  Asia Carrera's 
rad. I'm more into the amateur ones.   New faces.

One quick note b4 the juicy stuff!
Look out for TekNova's one year anniversary show coming up on November 20! 
  

We'll here we go again!  Another TekNova show, once again teamed up with
Disco Mafia (the same two companies that brought you Robert De LaGauthier,
July 31).

Here's the situation:
 		Prepare to be tweaked and phreaked because on...

	FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1998
TekNova Productions and Disco Mafia present:

	DJ HARDWARE (Florida)
		Toxic Recordings, Adrenaline Records, ESP/SUN Records
     
       As always some of Cleveland's finest homegrown local talent will be
opening the night (These DJ's are incredible and other cities need to find
out about them, so any promoters or such interested, contact me and I will
hook it all up or even just come to the show). Beginning the evening are
DJ's:     
		MIKE FILLY
		FREEBASS (of TekNova Productions)

       Expect Hardware to be performing a 3 hour set of non-stop heart
pounding, feet stomping, out of body experiencing music.  He tore it up at
our event Creation on November 15, 1997 along the sides of Mike Dearborn,
T-1000, Jordan Vestayo, Boywonder, and Mr. Nivoc.  All ~800 attendees ate
it up.  Then we brought him back for P.M.S.. Quit cha' bitchin' (A monthly
cycle) on January 23, 1998 for a 2 1/2 hour solo performance (with opening
local talent) to a small local club.  This time ~350 come to see him
illustrate his unmatchable style and skill of hard acid trance and hard
trance breaks. 

     This is surely another one of our events not to miss.  Make sure to be
there.

     The venue is Trilogy Night Club, 2325 Elm St. in downtown Cleveland. 
Exact directions and more info will be posted later this week.

INFO LINE NUMBERS:
Main Info Line
	TekNova Productions - 216.556.2305
I am almost certain Disco Mafia's has info also
	Disco Mafia - 216.575.1545

***********************************************************************
Alright, here's what you do: copy this entire e-mail (starting at the
line of equal signs above this, highlight everything and then under
edit click on copy then open a new mail and click paste) and change
the answers so they apply to you. ..  Then send it to all your buddies, 
including the person that sent it to you. So the end result,
you should get a mad dose of e-mails in your mail box and maybe learn
something you didn't know about your buddies.  Feel free to add some!!
This takes a while, but its a lot of fun! I would love to receive some 
of these again.

        I was wondering if anyone else is going any of the moonshine over
america events. I know that the cle appearance will be on oct. 4, or otherwise
this upcoming sunday at trilogy. The main reason why I have to go to this
event is because mr. carl cox is supposedly headlining the tour. Everyone can
appreciate the skills of the triple deck wizard. Anyways, just thought that
I'd see who else might be going.

Hell yes I'm going to both!  DJ Hardware is one of my all time favorite
dj's -- if you don't know him, he spins some wild acid trance and hard
trance.  He's originally from upstate New York.  As for the Moonshine
Tour, the line up is sick.  Cirrus, DJ Dan, ect . . . this would be
considered one of the biggest raves if it were on a Saturday.  I imagine
it'll be more intimate on a Sunday and a real treat fo sho.  I'm going
even though my job fair is the next day -- yes, I'm an idiot but you have
to have your priorities in line, right?

So add me please . . . Braden <balbert@apk.net>

Yeah, it will be a nice crowd though I bet, even for a Sunday night. No you
are only an idiot if you miss it, in my opinion (especially if you live in
Cleveland). I will probably take Monday off from work (my first day off from
work since May!) but Rob DID say it'll end around 3:30-ish, so its not too
late to get some sleep in if you HAVE to go to work or school in the morning!!

As Rob mentioned...

I have a full stock of Moonshine product at the store on CD.  Sorry, not
alot of vinyl on this one.
There is a Moonshine over America full length CD.
There are also several John Kelley mix CD's, including his latest.
Both of the Cirrus albums are in stock as well, along with many other
Moonshine titles.

The first 15 people in the store just to say "hi" (and hopefully purchase
some form of product) will recieve a Moonshine over America promo cd.  Just
mention that your on the list and want the CD.

If you have never seen Cirrus live... then make sure you check this out.
They put on an amazing show.

Last year, Moonshine over America rolled through Trilogy (October 97).  I am
quite certain that no one was dissapointed (unless you came to see Keoki who
was FUCKED UP out of his mind due to his birthday).   It was an incredible
show and Steve Levy and Tall Paul were amazing.  The interesting thing to me
was that they both played quite a bit of the then emerging "speed garage"
and "big beat" sounds in an "underground" setting.  Cleveland club kids were
already well versed in this style of new music (through the fine stable of
local dj's) and more than one person commented on how interesting it was to
hear a European dj like Tall Paul play records that were already popular in
our clubs.   On a side note, all of my New York distributors are telling me
that "speed garage" is finally just now making it big there after it was
labled TABOO when the sounds first appeared.

For those of you who don't know... last year's Cleveland stop of Moonshine
over America made international DJ news.  The European version of Mix Mag
did a very positive cover story on Taul Pall and the Cleveland show.   He
was speaking on how he had planned on playing alot of "get out of jail"
records and how amazed he was when he didn't have to use them.  There were
also a few pictures of Trilogy in the article.  BY THE WAY... if anyone has
a copy of that issue laying around I would GREATLY appreciate the use of it
for a week or two.

So my point is...
Make plans to go to Moonshine Over America next sunday (October 4) at U4ia.
You will be amazed.

we're supposed to set up the ele_mental sound system up in the hallway.
perhaps that would be a good place to meet.

if so, i guess i'll be there too.

did anyone pick a time yet?  2 AM seems so bad, with everyone "peaking"
around that time (artificially or not).  howabout not even picking a
specific time at all?  just meet right after dave holland's set, for
example.

oh yeah, somebody should make PB-CLE badges or stickers.  maybe one that
says "NET" too. 

(am i the only one who is getting misty-eyed over all of this??)

Ok heres my reveiw ov Motive.  I wanted to take a couple days to look back and
recouperate from Motive.  I just got tha pictures back and I cant wait for
submerged cause I wanna go back and I am hoping what I have heard is true
about it being at tha same place.  Alot ov people complained about tha venue
but it always seems like I like tha places alot ov people didnt like (ex.-get
freaky 2-loved that venue, wanna go back)  I didnt think it was crowded, there
were so many places to venture.  I loved thee upstairs room after tha hip-hop
was over especially.  That was my room. I spent almost thee entire night
dancing up there.  I would ocassionly go smoke a cigarette and see how my
freinds were doin that chose to spend most ov their night chillin in tha
bathroom right around tha corner from that room.  Tha room was carpeted (
which I think had alot to do with tha reason that my legs are barely sore ),
and it had an air conditoner which was great to take a break, chill in front
ov and get massaged. Tha other dancers who joined me up there were tha shit
too.  Pounce, and amy are tha two I remember tha most.  Hugh joined me fer a
little bit too, early on.  Thee three man live acid trance Pa was amazing.
There was this canton kid who was at Motive for his first party ( who was one
ov tha people sittin in tha bathroom ) was trippin for his fourth time and
indulged himself in a qaurter ov a sheet that night.  He was pure stoopid.  I
hooked a leash to him and draged him from tha bathroom.  I thought he should
be enjoying such an intense experience somewhere there was cool shit to hear
and people sportin their kick ass transcendental motions to the music at.  I
love watchin everyones individual styles just as much as I like taking part.
I didnt think he should be wastin his intense experience in THa BATHROOM.
He thanked me in tha morning.  He was just so out ov it he couldnt figure out
what to do.  After that some experimental dj came on and was right up at tha
table dancin and urgin him on sayin " trip it out, trip it out".  I wish I
would have caught his name.  That room was small but I liked tha intamacy.
After that everything went by in such a blur.  All I know is it was a blast.
Tha netmeet was tha shit too.  I wish I would have seen more ov everyone but
that second room just kept callin me.  More people should have checked it out,
but in a way I was glad it wasnt too crowded.  Butt i wish everyone could have
been there with me.  I am kinda solataire at alot ov parties cause I get more
into strange music and it just sucks me right in, but I still managed to meet
alot ov people.  I meet this girl who remembers seein me at my first big party
(kerry- thee first 420, 3 or 4 years ago cant remember which).  I was kinda
fat then and i wore a mask and my freind and I carried around a bookbag full
ov MacDonalds (and etc.) toys, styrofoam balls and playing cards and she said
she rememberd getting a toy from me.  I thought that was tha shit.  	That was
my first Columbus party and I thought it was tha shit, I thought tha kidz were
great, thee atmosphere was great, thee music was tha shit, and tha venue was
fly as hell.
	I wus disapointed cause we didnt get our flyerz for continuum that day like
we were supposed to but look for them if you are at Submerge.  We should have
them then.  
	I wanna thank everyone at tha net meet for welcoming me into tha family.
Matt for introducing me with tha flyer he gave me at our last party Liquid.
Mr. Rab for tha phat lamenent ( I will pin it to my backpack).  And whoever
had to do with chosing thee music for tha upstairs room.  I look forward to
seeing you all at submerge and if anyone wants me to send them thee pics from
Motive after i scan them just E-mail me. 
	Oh yeah Hugh I am glad you enjoyed your first party, hope to keep seeing you.
I heard you met my freind Chevon.  She's a sweety (until tha sun rises).   
	Sorry if that seemed a little long but I felt since I was new to thee list it
would be appropriate for me to kinda introduce myself by doing such an in
depth reveiw.
	Peace Every1..........Love

i still have some of the old net ones you made awhile back.   we have a guy

i still dunno if i'm going to submerge or not, i'm not particular of the

It is at U4ia.  Rob posted it first.  Casey reposted it clarifying the
location.  And I posted it again with the correct location.


HARDWARE = TRILOGY = FRIDAY
MOONSHINE = U4IA = SUNDAY

I hope that's clear ;)

That sounded funky.
Rob posted U4ia.
Casey posted U4ia.
I posted U4ia early today.
And that 5 minute old post I just made was the 4th time.

I didn't mean to imply that any of those locations (U4ia, U4ia, U4ia, and
U4ia) were wrong!

Are you all throughly confused yet ;)

Hey Kids, I wanted to thank you for making me feel so welcome in the PB-CLE
rave seen.  Although I have been going to raves for a couple of years, doing
mostly security work, this year I am attending as a participant.  So far as
motive goes, the music was O.K., the dance floor was much too crowded.  But
what makes the rave a real success are the kids that attend.  I must say I met
so many new friends and was reunited with old ones, please forgive me if I
don't remember all your names, I think it is more important to remember the
person.  I was planing to render some PB-CLE stickers.  I hope to have them
done by SUBMERGED.  So I guess that means that I am planing to go to
submerged.  My girlfriend Mary Lou cannot make it,  she was happy at MOTIVE,
but when we got into the car to go to the motel room 4 blocks away it took 1/2
hour to get there, (i think they moved the motel on me) needless to say she
got very car sick and needs time to recuperate.  So far as anyone needing
printing, please E-Mail me the specifications and how you are going to get me
the flyer (ZIP disk, SYQUEST) If you design the flyer it needs to be in
ADOBE,or QUARK in a TIFF, or BMP format.  I will try to work with any other
format you may have, but I can't make any guarantees.  As a hint to keep costs
down the more you want the more it is going to cost, so if you don't need full
color on both sides don't design it that way.  Well anyway I hope to see all
your smiling faces at SUBMERGED.  Peace...  {:-) Mark  E-Mail at:

I have to say that I had the best time at motive.  the vibe was awesome,
the music was great, and the people were very friendly.  It was
definetly worth the drive from Cleveland.  I wish I would have met more
people on the list, but I was so blown out that I couldn't probably
remember anyways.

Thanks to MrRab for the PB-CLE Raves badge!!  I hope to see some of you
at Rhythm on Oct 9th.

Just to let ya'll know Frankenberry & "BoOo"berry cereals are in stores for
the Halloween season.  I stocked up on 3 boxes of each and I've already downed
two.  Man, I've never tried Crystal but I think this shits a little more
powerful.  I don't think I've blinked for at least 3 hours.  I think I'm going
to go for a run now

Okay, this was pretty funny, and I laughed -- but it's still not
*quite* as hilarious to those of us who actually have discovered boxes
of condoms in their 83-year-old grandfather's top dresser drawer while
helping him look for his check book.  Yuck!!!

(And I still haven't figured out why he even needed the condoms; I
will assume it was a cleanliness issue rather than a pregnancy or STD
one.)

the following is my attempt to verbalize the immense power that rob hood's
set exerted over my mind and body last saturday at MOTIVE (columbus).

rob hood began his set at about 2:40, after a rather problematic set by my
boy monochrome (problematic because it was 1/2 live, 1/2 DJ, and he was
leaving for a 2-month study trip to england only hours after the show, so
i can't blame him for being a little scatterbrained).  after charles ended
with a squelchy live electro track, rob stepped up to the decks with a
confident look, and proceeded to take control.

for most of his set, he stayed within a rather narrow band of sounds, not
unlike jeff mills' set at SECTOR 616 a few months ago.  but unlike jeff,
whose music ended up sounding lackluster and a bit monotonal, rob hood
squeezed some amazing juice out of his thin, minimal techno. 

more amazing was the fact that overall, his music didn't seem to go
anywhere.  it stayed in the middle.  the music would occasionally build
upwards and outwards with stuttering snares and crescendoes of high hats,
only to slide down into near-nothingness a few bars later, barely audible
as dance music at all.  the end result should have sounded safe and
non-committal, but it was anything but that.

it was a kind of techno that is all about small details, VERY small
details.  tiny, blubbering bleeps; microscopic tiks; fluttering sheets of
sound that interlocked into dark, incomprehensible, skeletal, grooves that
bubbled deep in my chest.  

in a word, PHAT.

and no one seemed to miss mr. beltram, who was "stuck" in austria.  at
least he called to apologize.  he's not such a great DJ anyway!

despite a few problems and a little chaos, i would like to personally
thank surreal productions for throwing an honest jam.  did anyone notice
that they were letting lots of people in for $10, $5, or even free?  can't
beat that.

hi...

favor/request to ask of yinz...

i will be flying into akron around 2:30 pm sat aftnoon. im looking to 
get to pittsburgh. yeah i could take the bus, but i am looking for a 
more interesting way to get there ;)

some ideas - anyone from pittsburgh who is going to trilogy on friday 
nite and crashes afterwards...could pick me up and give me a ride back 
to the burgh.

maybe someone in the cle/akron area happens to be going to pgh on 
sat...care to pick me up? i checked the rom, there doesnt seem to be any 
pgh events on sat tho.

if that fails, my plane arrives at 2:20 pm and my bus leaves at 7:30 ( 
so :P i did my homework, im not just flying willy nilly all over the 
place). so to those of you that were cc:ed this message, that means you 
should come to akron and either pick me up or hang out with me in 
akron...(the same bus leaves cleveland at like 6:45 so you dont 
necessarily have to drive back to akron)....so get at me dawg and tell 
me whats up. :)


lovin hotlanta,
hossam

what's up y'all...

money opportunity here. i'm only posting this cause like neki, i know
hard-workin ravers like us need money.

there are 2 psychology studies goin on @ pitt and basically anyone can
sign p and get paid like $200-$350 per study. it takes some time to
complete but they fit it around your time schedule.

so call:

412-624-0821

and follow the instructions. with that many ravers it is likely to
fuck up their results (considering it IS a psychology study, and i
know that a lot of our perceptions of reality are rather... um...
broad :) but, hey - who cares? ;)

The first thing I would say is don't exit where I did, unless exploring
the ghettos of Columbus is on your agenda!

Oh you silly goose, I LIVE in erie.  i was just saying that most of the kids i
hang with, live by, and that are my age don't listen to music that I like,
which is totally fine.  By making that comment I was purely stating how there
isnt much of a market for good music in erie.  I'm very appreciative of what
we do have :)

   an introduction to
                          A TRIBUTE TO THA PIXIE QUEEN


I used to think that thee things I pondered would always be a mytery,  locked
away in some distant plain ov existence where thee mistakes that haunt me
followed themsleves towards a graying sky.  Long after an attempt at grabbing
a hold ov thee one thing I cared for till this day.  I am lost these days
trying to forget, but my dreams are haunted by thee only peace I met.   Black
are these days I find nothing much matters , haunted by my dream which I so
long to be true.  Back at tha last touch tha breath inside ov me cried its
last real breath.  Those days are gone and always returning but  without you
there with me and thee soul injected rhtyhm puppeteer holding our strings and
controling our elements.  As we were swept up above and beyond to places
unreachable, where no one could touch us.  Ubove thee sky were you and me.
Now returning to thee bound we had , where thee crystals took us far and thee
vapors filled our masks, together, ov tha same tribe praying to thee gods ov
tha beat.  Infected were we  far into thee day.  Our sunday sermons were
earlier than most but thee gods we were praying is right inside ov us.  He
grabs us by our soul and quickly reaches realms inside, spreading through
which every way, till all was in sync.  These days alone I often see you
kickin it next to me.  If you think ive forgoten in this time gone by, i've
only been blinded by the fact it cannot be.  Every time I peer across thee
floor your image it flashes at me only to disapear into tha crowd.  I often
close my eyes and remember tha way we moved.  I live on and keep kickin it at
parties with tha  hope that on one sunday morning, on some dark dance floor as
thee fog fills thee room and thee rainbow beams fly past us, we will once
agian return to that place where only you and i can travel, to that bond only
you and I share.  Tha god ov tha beat will forever fill our bodies, and thee
hope will keep me alive. We will oneday glow in sync again.  I will never
forget.  Long live tha Pixie Queen, may your soul continue to glow
strong...........
TO BE COntinued...................
