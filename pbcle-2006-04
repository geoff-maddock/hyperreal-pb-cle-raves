Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

I finally saw the "Better Living Through Cirtuitry", quite interesting, the
best of the documentaries I've seen... Did anyone else notice that while
they were interviewing the Kraftwerk guy that they were actually playing
Kraftwelt? There was some guy in that video that was the spitting image of
Trout... I never thought there would be 2 trouts in the world!

I wish there was one that just focused on the culture though, it seems all
that I've seen really focus on the DJs... even though half of the DJs are
standing there saying "It's not about the DJs it's about the
party/people"...

Can anyone recommend an uber-cheap midi keyboard? I would like it to be
velocity sensitive, small, and cheap... I'll prolly end up picking it up
used or on Ebay.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ipod dj gadget

The D2 Director seems more like the thing to have. It has the same USB
connections as the iDJ2, it's in a smaller 19" rack case and has
analog outputs for both channels and it doesn't have the ipod slot.

The ipod is just being used as a portable usb hard drive on this
thing. You can think of the unit as two mp3 players in one box that
share the same hard drive and have pitch control.

I read somewhere that the iDJ2 is going for 679 euros so $279 seems
cheap. It might be a misprint, then again, maybe not.

 The iDJ2 is just in a little more usable format/size for me... and the wif=
e
can plug her ipod in to it too which isn't bad.

Yeah I was skeptical of that place listing them for $279... Froogle just
turned up the first listing on there at $599 (djmart.com)

Sigh...

There go my plans... More waiting I guess.

I remember seeing an advert in VICE magazine for a documentary called
"Raver Bathroom" made by the same people that made "Heavymetal Parking
Lot".  The producers put cameras behind the mirrors at several raves and
captured the goings on.

Google will give some tidbits...

Rave Music Is Good, But Ravers Aren’t
Rant submitted by: Tom Mitchell, South Side
Rant # 190


Unlike most young adults in my age group that go to college here, I chose
to stay and start a career here after school. I have been living in the
pittsburgh area now for about 10 years. I love the small underground
cultures that continue here and quite frequently attend a variety of
shows, concerts and club nights. I’ve attended maybe four raves here and
always loved the different styles of electronic music ranging from techno
to drum and bass to house music.

But one thing I can’t stand is ravers. That’s right I said it: I fucking
hate them! Why you may ask? Starting back in my college years, some
roommates of mine used to go to raves, get completely shitfaced and bring
their raver buddies over to our apartment. These kids would shack up for a
night all smelly and nasty from the night before and eat all our food and
trash our bathroom. I used to work on night shift as a stock boy on the
weekends so most of my time was spent working and trying to get an
education. I didn’t make that much money, but the cash I did make went to
bills, rent and food. Nothing would piss me off more than to come home and
find some nasty cracked-out raver getting it on with one of my roommates
in our living room. From the stench, I could tell they had just spent the
night partying, leaving the all-too-common odor of musty smoke machine and
sweaty ass imbedded in to our couch that would take a week to scrub out.

I finally graduated and got a job with UPMC. I have a great job, a nice
girlfriend and live in one of the coolest areas in town. On a recent
Friday night my girlfriend and I went down to a local bar to dance. I had
no clue who the deejay was that night, but he must have been a popular guy
around the local scene because to our dismay, there were so many obvious
ravers. I hadn’t seen so many in one room since my old college apartment
and until that night, had thought most of that fad had died out.

The night got longer, and after a few martinis our hopes for a simple
night of dancing and drinking were shattered. My girlfriend got hit on by
two dorks from West Virginia who offered her drugs. That old familiar foul
smell of raver filled the room and I was completely appalled by the
obnoxious guy yelling annoying comments to the crowd of idiots who looked
like a bunch of special-needs children having a high school dance. My
girlfriend asked, “Who are these people?” I smirked and replied “RAVERS!”

At this point we decided to leave, but my girlfriend needed to use the
bathroom. When she got back, she had a shocked, pale look on her face and
said that the floor was covered in vomit, urine and poop. I just grabbed
her hand to leave. Coming down the stairs, some guy was trying to hand us
a flyer for what appeared to be a rave. Racing to the exit, I stopped and
looked at the flyer, and asked him, “Is this for a rave”? He said, “Yeah
man, it’s going to be a dope party!” I handed the flyer back to him.

“What’s the matter, don’t you like music?” he asked. Still trying to
leave, I said to myself, “What does enjoying music have to do with raves?”
I was half tempted to grab the remaining stack of flyers off this kid and
bash his face in and forcibly sodomize the little son of bitch with them,
but instead I just put up my middle finger and said, “Fuck ravers!”

Subject: {pb-cle} the heinous rave 5.5

so me and todd were in columbus for an anime convention, and popped over 
to cinci for the heinous rave.  noisecore, gabber, some speedcore, all 
that plurry stuff.

that party was insane, i haven't seen kids get into that stuff like they 
did in years.  and it seems they have it happening pretty regularly.  
they have shit happening all the time it looks like, how did i miss 
this?  actually i've seen some of the events here and there around the 
internets but cinci is such a drive.

Ohh and a couple other things:

"At the peak, the man was taking an estimated 25 pills every day for  
four years."

OK, besides disregarding the fact that even if he could get them for  
$5 each that's still $125/day, how did he not die?  I guess if you  
step up to that much...  also how would you even feel anything since  
you obviously at that point had no seratonin in 'storage'  Unless you  
just get the wakey wakey feeling.

Yeah that's my thought exactly.... although I see various reports of prices
as low as $2.50 per pill now adays, 4 years ago it was more like $10 each..=
.

Examining him scientifically to gauge the effects of MDMA is total bunk,
because as you say he's not getting any extra serotonin, he's just getting
hammered with whatever the pills are cut with... I'd guess his dealer may
have been lacing them with smack or something else addictive. How he could
spend that much money on pills, and be that jacked up, and still be able to
hold a job to spend that much money on pills is the real Mr.E. They also
mentioned he was a heavy pot smoker... Even if he was taking pure E, you
can't isolate the effects of the E from the pot he was smoking, not to
mention any drug interactions. It's all just a bunch of crap, worthless to
any "scientific" observations.

I'm sure some governmental agency will use whatever data none the less to
extol the dangers of Ecstasy.

OK I am a Conservative atheist and the fact that you feel it necessary to
chime in and troll every time you have a chance plays to your maturity.
Why do you feel it necessary to ram your ideas down people's throats? There
are forums dedicated to this kind of thing. You are simply screaming out
like a child that feels he doesn't get enough attention.

Hear me! Some one listen to me! Some one argue with me so that I can feel
like I have some kind of meaning.

Hell I agree with you on about 90% of what you say but why here and why
hijack a thread because you could.
She wasn't making a political statement she was making a fucking joke.

Do you think any of these liberals here are trying to hear you?
Do you think any of the Conservative/libertians on here feel they need to
hear from you yet again.
Do you think anyone checking up on the current pbcle rave news and culture
WANTS TO READ THIS CRAP.

I post to this list about 2 times a year yet I have seen your same post
about 200 times.

We get it. You like bush. You like everyone else should. You think liberals
are evil. Ok point made.

I just needed to vent but i should delete this since all I am doing is
throwing you food.

I will change the subject and hope it dies with my one post.

The basis of the Guardian article is a letter to the editor of a 
Psychiatric magazine. I'm not sure that this was an actual scientific 
study. The original letter to the editor is here: http://tinyurl.com/m7voo.

Gawd, that report was even more pathetic...

"Mr. A reported current cannabis consumption, together with a previous
history of polydrug misuse (i.e., solvents, benzodiazepines, amphetamines,
LSD, cocaine, heroin)."

So the guy was sniffing glue, doing speed, LSD, Cocaine, Heroin, pot, and
ecstasy... and their conclusion is:

"We feel that this case report adds to the existing limited knowledge of
persistent sequelae associated with heavy and regular ecstasy intake."

Umm yeah... it seems to me that "*Christos Kouimtsidis, Fabrizio Schifano,
University **of London, UK, Tim Sharp, Watford, UK, Lisa Ford, Justin
Robinson, and Colm Magee, Slippers Hill, UK* " should all be fired and sent
back to basic science classes for retraining.

FYI,

The term "Troll" is borrowed from fishing... where in Fishing you put on
your tastiest looking lure / bait, cast it out there, run the boat at low
speed, hoping some stupid fish will bite.

On the internet it refers to making a comment that's sure to provoke someon=
e
into an argument. The trolls are the people making comments they're sure
will elicit an angry response, in effect a troll isn't the person respondin=
g
to an inciting post, it's the original poster.

A classic troll would be to go into the photoshop forum (visited by both
mac and PC users) and ask "Which is better, a mac or a pc?", and step back
and watch the fireworks.

A troll posts for the purpose of obtaining pleasure out of seeing or
participating in an argument.

IMO, anyone posting opinions about Race, Religion, Politics, or Sexual
Orientation in any newsgroup or mailing list that's not specifically about
those subjects is trolling, whether they intend to or not... it's sure to
anger people and provoke an angry response.

Entropy's annoying as hell, and I wish he'd be booted from the list, but
from what I've seen over the last 6 months or so since I've been back on th=
e
list, he's generally not a Troll, he's usually the stupid fish that will
bite on any lure, and generally just argumentative as hell. He doesn't seem
to post for the pleasure of argument so much as to defend his beliefs to th=
e
bitter end.

I'd also like to add that IMO, whoever dug up this thread after a month or
more of it being dead is a troll as well. Smart move, thanks, please kiss m=
y
a$$.

 responding to an&nbsp;inciting&nbsp;post, it's the original poster.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A classic troll would be to go into the photoshop forum (visited by bo=
th mac&nbsp;and PC users) and ask &quot;Which is better, a mac or a pc?&quo=

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A troll posts for the purpose of obtaining pleasure out of seeing or p=
articipating in an argument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>IMO, anyone posting opinions about Race, Religion, Politics, or Sexual=
 Orientation in any newsgroup or mailing list that's not specifically about=
 those subjects is trolling, whether they intend to or not... it's sure to =
anger people and provoke an angry response.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Entropy's annoying as hell, and I wish he'd be booted from the list, b=
ut from what I've seen over the last 6 months or so since I've been back on=
 the list, he's generally not a Troll, he's usually the stupid fish that wi=
ll bite on any lure, and generally just argumentative as hell. He doesn't s=
eem to post for the pleasure of argument so much as to defend his beliefs t=
o the bitter end.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd also like to add that IMO, whoever dug up this thread after a mont=
h or more of it being dead is a troll as well. Smart move, thanks, please k=

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

After selling out 3 nights in London, being nominated for best 
documentary at SMMASH fest, and drawing over 1000 people at the Ann 
Arbor Film Festival, local filmmaker Gary Bredow brings this 
higly-acclaimed film back to his hometown for a Detroit celebration that 
promises to be one of the most talked about Electronic Music events of 
2006. Being released by acclaimed music documentary company Plexi Film

Fri May 05                         A-TRAK                         Cleveland

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB

Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

it depends, is the cd made from mp3's or does it contain the Sony DRM
rootkit?

you cant hack a computer with vinyl, but you can with a CD.

or can you?  maybe someone could design a final scratch record that hacks a
pc...

here's another one... i've been trying out IE7 for the past 3-4 weeks, it's
decent, stole a lot of the cool things from firefox... so what's better,
firefox or IE7?

When at one of those free p2p places, what is the correct file to download for software? I was looking at so many different fruity loops one's with all types of extensions, I wasn't sure which one to pick. Most seemed so vague. .exe , .rar , .dll   which one is correct? It seems like getting free software is a chore. if anyone has a clue on this stuff let me know what i should be downloading. I was thiking about just doing everything but i wasn't positive if that would work. it seems like everything was all spread out. thanks

I hate that. It's so damn hard to download free shit. It's like that
with porn too. You carefully select your search criteria, start your
downloads, and then you go to watch them and it's like WTF, she is NOT
a virgin and that is NOT a golden retriever.  I think I'm gonna call
my ISP and ask for my money back. The internets is whack.

making music just to get some man meat. Um, as long as you aren't one
of those chubtastic loser goth bitches that thinks raves are all
accepting and shit. If so you better bring me some money or your
skinny little sister, or your mom.

You like it from the back?

You might want to ask a more specific question than "what's the
correct file to download for software"?

What are you trying to download?

You are going to want a .rar or .zip which will be an archive file
which you will then have to "unzip".  You will then run the .exe file
that will be in the directory you just created when you unzipped the
.rar or .zip.

The best anti-virus program is AVG and it is free.

http://www.grisoft.com/doc/289/lng/us/tpl/tpl01

Private bit-torrent trackers are much safer.

Even safer is buying the software or just getting freeware (and less
complicated).

If you decide to continue making music I definetly suggest purchaseing
at least your main tools...especially your host.

Wait until you come across a program split into multiple directories,
each with its own zip, each containig a split rar which all need
placed in the same directory and then un-rared before you can install
it.

Be sure to open the .nfo files in notepad so you can read the
installation instructions.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question about downloading software

I definitely have to agree with buying your software, I can't tell you
how many good bug fixes I've gotten from the Abletons and how many
times I've abused support reps. They tend to frown on you getting
support when you didn't buy a license.

On the other hand, I think that so many demos of things are way too
crippled to actually see the benefit of using them.

What a dilemma

Problem is if you want to enter into music production, it's a HUGE
step to spend many hundreds of dollars on the software.

If you already have produced music, it's not nearly the leap...

compared to?

the thousands it used to take?    Just being a DJ who does their
homework and also stays on top of current releases would cost more
than getting started working on music production really..

of course these days when people don't pay for their music anymore
that may be a different story..

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question about downloading software

Being a DJ is far more costly than producing music; you're buying
someone else's product.

But looking at the cost of, say, reason + an oxygen8, you're already
around $600...  which doesn't justify stealing it, but certainly makes
it tempting because the thing is fairly easy to download.

I was comparing to "not working with music", to be honest.  Thinking,
gosh, I'd like to do that, and then seeing $500+?  That's somewhat
intimidating, I'd have to think.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question about downloading software

How about wanting to play golf but not wanting to buy golf clubs, or
wanting to learn to cook but not wanting to buy pans or knives, or
wanting to be a lawyer but not wanting to go to law school, or etc
etc..  as I get older I find that really to get involved in ANYTHING
you pretty much have to put your money (and more importantly, time,
which for some of us is more scarce) where your mouth is, if its
something you love doing.   I think generationally we are a culture of
instant gratification and it's kind of disturbing in a way.. I hate
being caught up in it but it's hard to escape.  Sorry I was bored..
I'll shutup now :)

They rent clubs, and you can learn to cook with $50-100 worth of
stuff.  :-)  Becoming a lawyer has a pretty much predetermined seven
year program, and is necessarily "what you do" for a living if you're
going to do that.

If you want to do a good job of producing, then $500 ain't gonna seem
like much.  If you want to dip your toes in, though, it's pretty
steep.


Then again, my point's still moot, because Reason (and a lotta others)
have some pretty good demos.  :-)

> Who pays for software?

I do.  I didnt start off that way.  I have to say though...I wouldnt
have been educated enough to let myself make large purchases if it
werent for warez.  I will still demo a few things via warez and see if
it sticks. If I find out I am going to use it more than just
experimenting with it a few times then I will buy it.  But at this
point between the things I legally own and freeware I have everything
I need and then some.  Plus I get some free licenses when I do
reviews.

A guy here at work is a big time christian.  Not only does he buy all  
his software, but all of his music.  He deleted all of the mp3s that  
he downloaded for free and now buys them all through itunes or buys  
the cd.  To add to the insanity he stopped playing any sort of  
violent games... like halo (if you ever played it you know the lack  
of blood and guts in that game).  At least he doesn't care I still  
play those games and uses the 'think about the children' excuse.

To Entropy,
Simply because one can easly "steal" does not justify doing it.
Sharing implies borrowing. Taking something that someone spent time and
effort on to develop with the intention to sell is STEALING. I am all about
free information and software and the FOSS movement but that doesn't mean I
am all about taking what I want with complete disregard to the developers
wishes.
Redefining something to fit you moral code of ethics is a sign of weak
character.
You of all people should now this.

To Little miss wants to learn to steal,
Why not use the list as a resource and hook up with some people that do
create music and have them show you the tools and more importantly teach yo=
u
how to use them. We are supposed to be a community after all and you have a
lot of "producers" on here.  So stop making excuses for your criminal
intentions.

If you steal it you will play with it for a week or two then that will be
it.

With this resource and the community here any crap about "i want to try it
before I buy it" is just smoke and a feable attempt at justifing theft. Not
to mention all of the software has good demos. Its criminal even if you you
don't want it to be.

Good idea.  I will be checking out everyones tunes.

As for mine...

The main page is a full up to date discography I just created....with
download links to the releases that are available for download.

http://jbible.experimedia.net/

And here is my myspace.com page with a few tracks that are not
available for download but you can stream them.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Stryke 2006 Bio
 
Triple threats don't come so easy in the world of electronic dance 
music.  Greg "Stryke" Chin is one of those rare anomalies in this 
industry.  He's equal parts recording artist, DJ, and producer.  The 
shy, sometimes introverted Stryke feels equally at home in all three.  
Born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, Stryke began his music career at 
an early age.  He started playing classical piano at the age of four.  
Moving to Miami, Florida (where he still resides) when he was ten, 
Stryke became heavily involved in early electronic alternative scene.  
His love for Beethoven and Chopin were quickly joined by his new love 
for groups such as Depeche Mode and New Order (not to mention an 
unhealthy addiction to video games, which he still has to this very 
day).  Buying his first synthesizer at age 12, Stryke quickly learned 
the ways of additive synthesis and began writing electronic songs with 
his trusty monophonic Roland SH-101 synth.  He soon discovered house and 
techno from a mix tape given to him by his cousin, who was a DJ in New 
York.  He was hooked.  At age 14, the young Stryke had already begun 
DJing to make money to buy more synth equipment.  But after discovering 
this new underground dance music, he became as passionate about DJing as 
he was about making music.  Says Stryke of the two, "Both production and 
DJing have really become one in the same for me.  I really can't 
separate  the two.  The words musician, artist, and DJ, all have the 
same importance to me."  Although his styles as a producer range 
anywhere from techno, house, ambient, progressive, Stryke hates the 
barrier game.  "I see it all as music.  Every genre has music which is 
good and bad.  That's it.  I hate the fact that some people raise an 
eyebrow when I release a house record when perhaps they know me for 
techno.  All that should matter is whether something is good or bad.  
Period."  Make no mistake however, all pigeonholing talk aside, when it 
comes to DJing, Stryke gets primal.  He's considered to be one of the 
top DJs around today.  His globetrotting schedule and growing legions of 
fans is proof positive of his ability to command dancefloors worldwide.  
His dexterity is proven time and time again.  While DJing, Stryke 
utilizes three turntables, digital CD players, Final Scratch 2 on a 
customized Alienware notebook, and live effects processing.  His live 
shows, while rare, are an even bigger treat.  He's had Billboard chart 
success with his Ad Finem project and as a remixer.  His guest vocal on 
the track "Time" with Murk, went #1 in the US in 2004.  He's 
collaborated with artists such as Murk, Christian Smith, John Beltran, 
Santos, & Alex Flater, to name a few.  With releases on labels such as 
Ovum, Hooj Choons, Monoid, Circle, Guidance, Platform, Twisted, & many 
others, there seems to be no end in sight for this bright star.  Over 
the years, his residencies have included nights at clubs such as the 
legendary Edge, Warsaw, Maze, & Nocturnal. In 2004, he was asked to be 
the official DJ for the MTV VMAs.  Balancing work between the studio and 
the road hasn't been easy.  But Stryke wouldn't have it any other way.  
"I'm truly blessed to be able to do what I love.  The work, the stress, 
and the hardship is all worth it at the end of the day."  Stryke is 
quickly becoming the hardest working man in electronic music.  
Listen...Communicate...Understand.

Fri May 05                         A-TRAK                         Cleveland

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

alex bau - biography
 

alex´s dj-sets, full of energy and devotion, turned dancefloors into 
total excess since 1992. his versatile selection of tracks, ranging from 
minimal to more hard edged technotracks, always develop a flow by 
keeping his very own but versatile style. The co-founder of toneman 
always gets people on his side until the last record has been played, 
mostly after several hours of extreme-partying

this approach to music is the result of a long career in the underground 
dance music industry, which began in the early 90's when spinning 
different kinds of dance music in his hometown and neighboring cities. 
in the very beginning, he recalls introducing early techno into his sets  
with moderate success, but he nevertheless dedicated his entire career 
to techno music. alex's musical aspirations have been inspired by 
composers such as roland orzabald (tear for fears), martin gore (depeche 
mode) and more ebm or 80ies synthiepop acts just to name a few.

in his sets, alex obeys to the old-school ethics of not just playing the 
hits but creating a story, even if he sometimes has to squeeze the whole 
set into a couple of hours. his experience as a radio- and club-resident 
dj from 1994 to 1996 and later on gigs throughout germany, austria, 
switzerland, czech republic, croatia, yugoslavia, hungary, poland, 
holland, canada or even romania or brasil has led him to win the hearts 
of an audience that is constantly growing in number. no matter what 
country on the world, booking alex means booking high quality, always 
grooving, sometimes minimal, sometimes hard techno that is brought to 
the audience by an artist with extraordinary solid skills on the decks 
paired with a huge amount of entertainment factor by the dj himself. 
this has also enabled him to apply his dance floor knowledge in the 
production studio where he creates potent club tracks with his partner 
and label mate sven dedek under monikers as basic implant, electric 
envoy and alex bau when these are his proper productions. Especially his 
first album .connected. was a clear statement by alex how .pure techno. 
looks like on his definition: versatile, entertaining, 
dancefloor-compatible and technically produced on the maximum level. no 
wonder that .connected. appears in the playlist of numerrous top-dj`s.

alex has released eps for fine audio, parasound, energy industries, 
rotation (dave angel's), toneman (his own), clr (chris liebing`s), 
pv-records (pascal feos), predicaments (justin berkovi`s) and default 
recordings. beside this he has remixed tracks for chris liebing and 
pascal feos. in addition to producing tracks for labels all around the 
globe, alex always consists on being recognized as a dj in a different 
kind of view beside the fact that of course his production style also 
reflects his musical preferences . pure techno, sometimes minimal, 
sometimes fat. in his eyes, the quality of a dj can not be measured with 
the number of releases.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

UnderGround Sound

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).



John B

John B
Beta Recordings, MMI
UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB
http://www.spreeandadb.com/
DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

Not only did it came and went, it came for free. No cover charge and camel
was giving away free packs of smokes too. All you sinners who didn't show
up... tisk tisk.... and I must say, BT was the shit. I wasn't expecting muc=

at all but he pimped that place.

We had a tiny little crazy afterparty at my house, after we inadvertantly
ended up at a gay bar frequented by the black-leather-chaps-and-no-shirt
types, only to get kicked out, stood outside in the cold for a while... all
that fun stuff.

"I saw a video the other day that really stood out from the rest of the 
links making the rounds.

It depicts a man demonstrating software that appears to parse what he's 
saying fast enough to reassemble the same words by pulling and 
reordering bits from a recorded Michael Jackson interview. The result: 
Jackson appears to speak the same sentence right back to him.

The man goes on to explain how the software behind this process works, 
and his video closes with a live performance of the software in which a 
performer appears to employ the beat-box method to control the playback 
of audio and video on a large video screen behind him, in front of what 
I can only imagine must be a dazzled crowd."

I was reading about this elsewhere today.  The performance
possibilities that a technology like this will bring to the table are
going to be great indeed.  The performance in the video was a little
grating but I think when mastered and then abused that this will make
for some very interesting audio video performances.

I believe this software/website is a media prank.  Watch the video,
especially at the end, no crowd and a grinning dj (the crowd noise was
certainly added for effect).  Plus the web-site is very tongue in cheek.

Yeah it's pretty cool, not particularly difficult to program, just a great
idea... The interview in the wired article says that it takes "just any 2
year old laptop" then says he's got 1.5gig of ram in it... It's my guess th=
e
whole video being played has to fit in memory at any one time, plus the
(admittedly small) database.

Calling it realtime is a stretch though, because it must complete listening
to a note (1/4, 1/8 or whatever size) before it can calculate a vector, and
start playing the associated datbase entry, assuming that the algorithm was
perfect and instantaneous, it would always be a note behind... making it
really unsuitable for live work mixed in with a real "real-time" source,
like it was suggested. I thought the live work they did was unmusical...
There was no rythm, which I think will always be the problem with this sort
of thing... perhaps if they ripped out the beat from the original track, an=
d
played it back delayed by a note so it would sync with whats coming out
transcoded it would be more appealing to the ears...

version of the video? Of course most germans speak english, perhaps chinese=

They did a lot of video chopping along with their audio chopping, and Timber was a much more musical incarnation of what this thing is doing...

Conservative Books Equate to 'Sexual Harassment'
By: Christopher Flickinger
Posted 04/17/06
02:58 PM

A "sexual harassment" investigation is ongoing at an Ohio college after the
school's librarian suggested that students read a few books from a
conservative perspective.

According to the Alliance Defense Fund -- a legal alliance that  
aggressively
defends religious liberty -- a librarian at Ohio State University at
Mansfield has been slapped with a "sexual harassment" charge after he
suggested that freshmen read four best-selling conservative books.

Scott Savage is a reference librarian at OSU Mansfield and a member of the
school's First Year Reading Experience Committee. After suggesting that
students read "The Marketing of Evil" by David Kupelian, "The Professors"  
by
David Horowitz, "Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis" by Bat Ye'or, and "It Takes a
Family" by Sen. Rick Santorum, Savage was put under "investigation."

The Alliance Defense Fund reports that three professors filed a complaint  
of
discrimination and harassment against Savage because the list of books he
suggested made them feel "unsafe."

"Universities are one of the most hostile places for Christians and
conservatives in America," said ADF Senior Legal Counsel David French, who
heads ADF's Center for Academic Freedom.  "It is shameful that OSU would
investigate a Christian librarian for simply recommending books that are at
odds with the prevailing politics of the university."

The Alliance Defense Fund sent a letter to school officials informing them
of the librarian's constitutional rights -- just in case they forgot.  But,
according to the ADF, the university is proceeding with its investigation
saying it takes "any allegation of sexual harassment seriously."

Even more troubling, this ridiculous "sexual harassment" claim was  
supported
by the school's entire faculty as they voted without dissent to file  
charges
against Savage. Later they voted to allow the individual professors to file
charges, according to the ADF.

"The OSU Mansfield faculty is attempting to label a librarian as a 'sexual
harasser' because they disagree with his book suggestions," said French.
"It is astonishing that an entire faculty would vote to launch a sexual
harassment investigation because a librarian offered book suggestions in a
committee whose purpose was to solicit such suggestions."

Curious as to which chapter of the Nazis Party was running this university,
"the Dean" of Human Events U visited the school's website and found the
following statement on "diversity" -- ".we celebrate and learn from our
diversity and we value individual differences. Academic freedom is defended
within an environment of civility, tolerance, and mutual respect."

But, apparently, this policy doesn't extend to conservatives.

I also found an incomplete list of the "Top Ten Reasons" why someone should
attend OSU Mansfield. I say "incomplete" because while the school listed
such attributes as "student tickets to OSU athletic events," "housing on
campus" and "convenient location with free parking," the school didn't
mention its most attractive feature: vilifying conservatives.

Case shmase, I bet money he won't be on that committee
for long. Keep your bible rattling crap in sunday
school where it belongs. Every class I have ever had
has been essentially relgion neutral.

Thanks for alerting us to religious pimplefucks like
Scott Savage. Now I know that I can safely recomend
OSU to my friends who have children. It seems that
it's a place where religious twats are targeted with
the branding iron of disgust they so rightly deserve.

It was just good business sense to drop the charges. A
good scare serves the purpose of alerting everyone to
mr pimplefuck's agenda so he will be properly ignored
and put in his place from this point forward.

Three cheers for OSU!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} it slices, it dices

The part that intrigued me the most was when they played a sequence
through the software and then slowly mixed back and forth between the
input sequence and the video's audio.  Right when the virtual fader
was centered there were interesting rhythms going on.  This could also
eventually be an interesting way to sync another songs video to your
own music.

I dont think it is a hoax.  I am pretty sure they are just being goofy.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri May 05                         A-TRAK                         Cleveland

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

alex bau - biography
 

alex´s dj-sets, full of energy and devotion, turned dancefloors into 
total excess since 1992. his versatile selection of tracks, ranging from 
minimal to more hard edged technotracks, always develop a flow by 
keeping his very own but versatile style. The co-founder of toneman 
always gets people on his side until the last record has been played, 
mostly after several hours of extreme-partying

this approach to music is the result of a long career in the underground 
dance music industry, which began in the early 90's when spinning 
different kinds of dance music in his hometown and neighboring cities. 
in the very beginning, he recalls introducing early techno into his sets  
with moderate success, but he nevertheless dedicated his entire career 
to techno music. alex's musical aspirations have been inspired by 
composers such as roland orzabald (tear for fears), martin gore (depeche 
mode) and more ebm or 80ies synthiepop acts just to name a few.

in his sets, alex obeys to the old-school ethics of not just playing the 
hits but creating a story, even if he sometimes has to squeeze the whole 
set into a couple of hours. his experience as a radio- and club-resident 
dj from 1994 to 1996 and later on gigs throughout germany, austria, 
switzerland, czech republic, croatia, yugoslavia, hungary, poland, 
holland, canada or even romania or brasil has led him to win the hearts 
of an audience that is constantly growing in number. no matter what 
country on the world, booking alex means booking high quality, always 
grooving, sometimes minimal, sometimes hard techno that is brought to 
the audience by an artist with extraordinary solid skills on the decks 
paired with a huge amount of entertainment factor by the dj himself. 
this has also enabled him to apply his dance floor knowledge in the 
production studio where he creates potent club tracks with his partner 
and label mate sven dedek under monikers as basic implant, electric 
envoy and alex bau when these are his proper productions. Especially his 
first album .connected. was a clear statement by alex how .pure techno. 
looks like on his definition: versatile, entertaining, 
dancefloor-compatible and technically produced on the maximum level. no 
wonder that .connected. appears in the playlist of numerrous top-dj`s.

alex has released eps for fine audio, parasound, energy industries, 
rotation (dave angel's), toneman (his own), clr (chris liebing`s), 
pv-records (pascal feos), predicaments (justin berkovi`s) and default 
recordings. beside this he has remixed tracks for chris liebing and 
pascal feos. in addition to producing tracks for labels all around the 
globe, alex always consists on being recognized as a dj in a different 
kind of view beside the fact that of course his production style also 
reflects his musical preferences . pure techno, sometimes minimal, 
sometimes fat. in his eyes, the quality of a dj can not be measured with 
the number of releases.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

UnderGround Sound

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has

Beta Recordings, MMI
UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB
http://www.spreeandadb.com/
DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

05.18 [ELYSIUM] - Steel City Funk www.innerchild.biz

05.25 [INTERGALACTIC FAERIE FUNK] - i.f.f. released 3 full length albums 
albums thru their own label (je suis galactique) to sell at their high 
energy live shows. they found themselves headlining festivals in toronto, 
edmonton, and nova scotia. they played all over the sunny state of 
california, the rainy city of pittsburgh, dirty philadelphia, and magical 
new orleans. big cities like san francisco, los angeles, toronto, and new 
york as well as smaller towns like nashville, hattiesburg,
and charleston were were visited by i.f.f. on many of the 2 to 3 month long 
tours. just recently, with the release of the ottawa 12" single on robbaudio 
and the upcoming release of a four song vinyl ep, things have come full 
circle. intergalactic faerie funk has returned to it's signature style of 
electronic house music based on strange tones & textures; as well as finding 
a return to the 'live pa' started by marc hug - although this time he is 
armed with a laptop, effects box, controller, & ableton live. 
www.galactique.net - Brooklyn, NY

06.08 [DJ NOSTEEL] - WPTS FM plus special guest [OUTPUT MESSAGE] - Born in 
Queens, New York, in 1983, spending his formative middle-school years in New 
Jersey, and finally ending up in Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka 
outputmessage) can be given that rare title of "young musical prodigy." 
During his time in New Jersey, he first became fascinated with a broad range 
of music, eventually keying in on electronic; and when his family got its 
first computer in the summer of 1998, he began making music on his own. Now, 
while a mathematics major with a minor in philosophy at Virginia Tech, he 
spends his off time writing hundreds of tight, hook-laden tracks. With a 
remix of Dabrye on the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a 
track ("Bernard’s Song") on Ghostly International’s Idol Tryouts compilation 
before even turning 20, the prospects are bright for this studious young 
man. www.outputmessage.com - Ghostly International / Urb's Next 100 -

The Music of Robert Rich:

Sonic Electronics & Sonic Surrealisms

"Join internationally-acclaimed electronic music artist Robert Rich under
the dome of the Henry Buhl, Jr. Planetarium with live lasers and special
effects. In his 20+ year career, Richs music has been distributed and
broadcast internationally on the Hearts of Space radio show and has been
included in feature films

With over two dozen albums, Robert Rich has helped define the genres of
ambient music, dark-ambient, tribal and trance, yet his music remains hard
to categorize. Part of his unique sound comes from using home-made
acoustic and electronic instruments, microtonal tunings, computer-based
signal processing, chaotic systems and feedback networks. Rich began
building his own analog synthesizers in 1976, when he was 13 years old,
and later studied for a year at Stanford's Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics (CCRMA).

Rich released his first album Sunyata in 1982. Most of his subsequent
recordings came out in Europe until 1989, when Rich began a string of
critically acclaimed releases for Fathom/Hearts of Space, including
Rainforest (1989), Gaud (1991), Propagation (1994) and Seven Veils (1998).
His two collaborations with Steve Roach, Strata (1990) and Soma (1992),
both charted for several months in Billboard. Other respected
collaborations include Stalker (1995 with B. Lustmord), Fissures (1997
with Alio Die) and Outpost (2002 with Ian Boddy.) Rich's contributions to
multi-artist compilations have been collected on his solo albums A
Troubled Resting Place (1996) and Below Zero (1998). He also records with
his group, Amoeba, exploring atmospheric songcraft on their CDs Watchful
(1997) and Pivot (2000). Live albums such as Calling Down the Sky (2004)
and 3-CD Humidity (2000) document the unique improvised flow of his recent
performances.

Rich has performed in caves, cathedrals, planetaria, art galleries and
concert halls throughout Europe and North America. His all-night Sleep
Concerts, first performed in 1982, became legendary in the San Francisco
area. In 1996 he revived his all-night concert format, playing Sleep
Concerts for live and radio audiences across the U.S. during a three month
tour. In 2001 Rich released the 7 hour DVD Somnium, a studio distillation
of the Sleep Concert experience, possibly the longest continuous piece of
music ever released.

Rich has designed sounds for television and film scores, including the
films Pitch Black, Crazy Beautiful, Behind Enemy Lines and others. His
musical score graces Yahia Mehamdi's documentary on worker's compensation,
Thank You for your Patience. Rich has worked closely with electronic
instrument manufacturers, and his sound design fills the preset libraries
of Emu's Proteus 3 and Morpheus, Seer Systems' Reality, sampling disks
Things that Go Bump in the Night, ACID Loop Library Liquid Planet, and the
TimewARP2600 soft-synth by WayOutWare. Rich has written software for
composers who work in just intonation, and he helped develop the MIDI
microtuning specification, which was accepted as an industry standard. As
mastering engineer, he has applied his ear to dozens of albums, and his
studio was featured twice in Keyboard Magazine.

"Robert Rich's recordings are fast becoming recognized as pioneering
works, having taken electronic music to previously unrealized levels of
innovation."
Darren Bergstein, I/E

"A music-scape that oozes with primitive life, as if pulsing from the
swamp itself. . . A time traveller searching for the aperture that looks
back to Eden."
Calvin Ahlgren, SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

"Countless, beautiful, diverse, intense, evocative, innovative, lavish,
awesome soundscapes."
Jill Grant, INTERFACE MAGAZINE

"Nothing, not one note, seems out of place or contrived. . .A bright and
attractive fusion of the ancient and the modern, a bold groundbreaking
musical statement."
Ben Kettlewell, DREAMSWORD

"Like listening to sonic architecture. . . Rich's structures are
geometrical, yet organic."
Linda Kohanov, PULSE!

"This is surely the stuff that fantasies are made of..."
P.J. Birosik, L.A. RESOURCES

Subject: {pb-cle} let the mp3 vs vinyl argument commence

http://www.physorg.com/news64807495.html

David Hayes of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the
University of Toronto says the growing popularity of vinyl might be a form
of resistance against the music industry's corporate taste-makers.

While conducting research for his Ph.D. dissertation, Hayes was surprised
to discover the young music enthusiasts he was interviewing were fans of
vinyl.

"This made me wonder why they were interested in something that is, for
all intents and purposes, a dead medium," he said, noting the teenagers
had switched from buying CDs to collecting LPs, often seeking obscure
recordings.

Hayes research subjects said they liked the visual appeal of LP jackets
and the challenge of seeking hard-to-find releases.

In yet another turnaround, teens overwhelmingly insisted the sound quality
of LPs was superior to that of modern formats. They characterized LPs and
the LP artists of the past as more authentic than the barrage of
youth-oriented music being aggressively marketed to them today.

Hayes detailed his research in the February issue of Popular Music and
Society.

Not being a DJ, I have no strong opinion about vinyl versus other formats,
but I DO think this research is on point when it comes to the homogenizatio=
n
of major-label releases. The record industry is seriously broken.
 DJ's, musicians, etc who care about real talent and originality have know
this for years. I think ( I hope) the general record-buying public is slowl=
y
starting to come around.

FLAC! http://flac.sourceforge.net

Move on.  Music distribution for money is a thing of the past.  Who
wants to pay for music when you have labels like experimedia giving
music of >=3D quality away for free.  And even more...we can afford to
take chances...which other labels are currently afraid to do.  Music
will not be allowed to evolve further unless there is someone willing
to take chances.

If people continue to fight free distribution methods and approach
music based on its packaging and price tag....as Jamie Lidell says
"music will not last".

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} let the mp3 vs vinyl argument commence

this has been going on for years. nothing new at all.

personally, that article seems to have more to do with the social
aspect of music fans than it does with the actual medium of the music.
anyone who's been on this list for more than a year would scoff at the
notion of vinyl as a "dead medium".

i can (and do) buy all the "obscure" music on vinyl that i could
possibly want, and rip it into the comptuer for further
manipulation/dj'ing/whatever else i want it for.

i like the fact that on some of the stuff i rip and dj with (on the
comuter) you can hear the crackle of the needle, if for no other
reason, than to give the tune a little more warmth. but i still love
the pliability that having it on the computer gives me as far as
looping, cue points, portability, ease of selection, variety, etc.

i don't particularly care that someone might think that i downloaded
the music from a p2p. if the person wants to draw that line in the
sand, then he/she isn't paying attention to the music i'm playing
anyway, so why bother?

i like the fact that, when i dj'd goose's wedding, i could've dropped
a detroit techno track right after the OSU fight song or "Take Me
Home, Country Roads" (did I play that?). if that makes you think less
of me, sorry...not my problem.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: According to bush the government created the ipod

[yes I know there's an OT list, but figured some pro-bush people would
like to have a status update on their fearful... oops, I mean fearless
leader]

Guess Al Gore already took credit for the internets, so dubya needs some
claim to fame:

(engadget.com article)  http://tinyurl.com/ggwu4

Apple has long boasted of its culture of innovation, and how this led to
such products as the original Mac and the iPod. However, it turns out
that, at least in the case of the iPod, Apple had a hidden ally: the US
government. During a speech at Tuskegee University, President (and iPod
user) George W. Bush told his audience, "the government funded research
in microdrive storage, electrochemistry and signal compression. They did
so for one reason: It turned out that those were the key ingredients for
the development of the iPod." While we have to gratefully acknowledge
the efforts of government agencies such as DARPA in some of the fields
mentioned by the President, we also feel obligated to point out the
accomplishments of private companies in the US and abroad, including
IBM, Hitachi and Toshiba -- not to mention the Fraunhofer Institute,
which developed the original MP3 codec, and codeveloped (with Sony, AT&T
and others) the AAC format used by Apple in the iPod. Still, we have to
bow down before his Steveness; we knew he was well-connected, but until
now we had no idea of his level of influence in the area of government
research. Hey, Steve, while you're at it, why not get the government to
resolve the display problems plaguing the next-gen video iPod? We're
sure they'll get their best minds on it and fix it in no time.

Of course.  Just pointing out how bad he is at speeches.  My favorite is
still "I'm a war president.  I make decisions here in the Oval Office in
foreign-policy matters with war on my mind."   Amazing how the tone

Every president needs to be a war president.

There are many liberations to do across the globe.

How about an EZMLM vs PHPBB argument?

I know Trout loves when I start that one.

I'm also guessing he assumes your a spammer.  Not making enough money at
the CIA?

And my little take on this.  Mailing lists are good for chit chatty type
stuff, message boards are good for support / reference / stuff that if
you searched through the forum you may find an answer to.

:i: get no spam (really I think I've gotten one spam message in like 2
weeks because of my |D ][ |\/| |D spam filterin' skilz.  Of cours I'm
probably blocking some good mail too.. but I never get them so I don't
know :)

I don't think I'm hip to purerave but it sounds like something that 
would totally ruin a white shirt. Anyway, yes - PHPBB (and VBulletin for 
that matter) are pretty much superior for their organization and 
searchability, and also because you get to have an avatar which makes 
anything at least a dodecillion times cooler.

The only complaint I have about the pbcle software is that when I mean

Actually the way this list works is the preferred way of doing it.   
As it supposedly makes more sense to people that when you hit reply  
you reply to the sender and reply all will "reply to all" meaning the  
list.  The annoying thing is you then get the message twice, once  
from when they reply directly and the other from the list.  I try to  
chop all of the recipients off if I'm replying to the list.  Not sure  
if the one on hyperreal has this, but some discussion list software  
can read the message and if it sees the message is directly addressed  
to you as well as the list, the list won't send the message, assuming  
you are going to get it because they sent you the message directly.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} let the mp3 vs vinyl argument commence

I assumed it was by design... I guess I assumed it was to reduce spam
or some such... it has annoyed the hell out of me since the mid 90s
though. It gets worse since other lists I'm on just send to the whole
list, so typically I'll reply, and hit send, then remember it only
sent it to the person not the list, then go reopen the sent message
and send to the list again... If I can remember, I'll reply to all,
then cut and rearrange all the emails so no one gets it twice... It
just seems like more work than it should be when I always mean to send
to the list... many times I've gotten replies from people on the list
that the tone of their message I know it was meant to be sent to the
list but was just sent to me... or I'll see threads on PBCLE that have
missing messages that it's happened to other parties but one of the
later parties was smart enough to realize, and put back in the pb-cle.

Small price to pay I guess... It's all good :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} KoolAid roll call

i think it's aweful.  I only use it a little bit.  Although there's  
some people that I can only contact them through myspace and don't  
have an email.  wtf? you had to use an email address to sign up?

Wish friendster got popular again.  Think it's so ironic that myspace  
was made because friendster was first crappy and unreliable.  But now  
that myspace is crappy and unreliable and friendster is fast and  
stable people still stick with myspace.

It's just like with IM.  I have an account on AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo!,  
Google, Skype, and Bitwise  and I talk to some people on every one of  
those.  So I have a myspace, a friendster, tribes, and a few other  
startup community sites that look cool but no one uses them.  I know  
google wants to have their chat work with all the different  
protocols.  They already work with some other VOIP clients (not skype  
though, yet) and I'm sure the other big guys aren't going to let them  
work without some serious kicking and screaming.

dont forsee that happening.  i used to have blue hair though that would 
have matched the blueberry koolaid though.  i miss the sharkleberry finn

Trout,

I would love to see you dressed up like Kool-aid.
In the 6th grade I turned a cardboard box into an ice cube and did a
talent show dance to, "Ice Ice Baby."

i concur.  it's not an efficient community.  i log in maybe once or twice a
month to read messages, and when i do, i tell the choads to just email me
when i respond.

i'm willing to wait for the googleborg to do it the right way, which you
know they will, then it may become of more use to me...
speaking of communities, i ran across this last night, found it interesting

http://www.highintelligence.com/

lots of good ideas on how to progress humanity through true globalization
(the obvious argument is that a utopian society isnt possible, but this at
least gets into the very technical aspect of how in theory it is possible)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------


Do you buy books online, use Google, or download to an Ipod? These =
activities, plus MoveOn's online organizing ability, will be hurt if =
Congress passes a radical law that gives giant corporations more control =
over the Internet.
Internet providers like AT&T and Verizon are lobbying Congress hard to =
gut Network Neutrality, the Internet's First Amendment. Net Neutrality =
prevents AT&T from choosing which websites open most easily for you =
based on which site pays AT&T more. Amazon doesn't have to outbid Barnes =
& Noble for the right to work more properly on your computer.

If Net Neutrality is gutted, MoveOn either pays protection money to =
dominant Internet providers or risks that online activism tools don't =
work for members. Amazon and Google either pay protection money or risk =
that their websites process slowly on your computer. That why these =
high-tech pioneers are joining the fight to protect Network =
Neutrality[1]--and you can do your part today.=20

The free and open Internet is under seige--can you sign this petition =
letting your member of Congress know you support preserving Network =
Neutrality? Click here:

http://www.civic.moveon.org/save_the_internet/

Then, please forward this to 3 friends. Protecting the free and open =
Internet is fundamental--it affects everything. When you sign this =
petition, you'll be kept informed of the next steps we can take to keep =
the heat on Congress. Votes begin in a House committee next week.

MoveOn has already seen what happens when the Internet's gatekeepers get =
too much control. Just last week, AOL blocked any email mentioning a =
coalition that MoveOn is a part of, which opposes AOL's proposed "email =
tax."[2] And last year, Canada's version of AT&T--Telus--blocked their =
Internet customers from visiting a website sympathetic to workers with =
whom Telus was negotiating.[3]=20

Politicians don't think we are paying attention to this issue. Many of =
them take campaign checks from big telecom companies and are on the =
verge of selling out to people like AT&T's CEO, who openly says, "The =
internet can't be free."[4]=20

Together, we can let Congress know we are paying attention. We can make =
sure they listen to our voices and the voices of people like Vint Cerf, =
a father of the Internet and Google's "Chief Internet Evangelist," who =
recently wrote this to Congress in support of preserving Network =
Neutrality:

    My fear is that, as written, this bill would do great damage to the =
Internet as we know it. Enshrining a rule that broadly permits network =
operators to discriminate in favor of certain kinds of services and to =
potentially interfere with others would place broadband operators in =
control of online activity...Telephone companies cannot tell consumers =
who they can call; network operators should not dictate what people can =
do online.[4]=20

The essence of the Internet is at risk--can you sign this petition =

P.S.  If Congress abandons Network Neutrality, who will be affected?=20
  a.. Advocacy groups like MoveOn--Political organizing could be slowed =
by a handful of dominant Internet providers who ask advocacy groups to =
pay "protection money" for their websites and online features to work =
correctly.=20
  b.. Nonprofits--A charity's website could open at snail-speed, and =
online contributions could grind to a halt, if nonprofits can't pay =
dominant Internet providers for access to "the fast lane" of Internet =
service.=20
  c.. Google users--Another search engine could pay dominant Internet =
providers like AT&T to guarantee the competing search engine opens =
faster than Google on your computer. =20
  d.. Innovators with the "next big idea"--Startups and entrepreneurs =
will be muscled out of the marketplace by big corporations that pay =
Internet providers for dominant placing on the Web. The little guy will =
be left in the "slow lane" with inferior Internet service, unable to =
compete.=20
  e.. Ipod listeners--A company like Comcast could slow access to =
iTunes, steering you to a higher-priced music service that it owned. =20
  f.. Online purchasers--Companies could pay Internet providers to =
guarantee their online sales process faster than competitors with lower =
prices--distorting your choice as a consumer.=20
  g.. Small businesses and tele-commuters--When Internet companies like =
AT&T favor their own services, you won't be able to choose more =
affordable providers for online video, teleconferencing, Internet phone =
calls, and software that connects your home computer to your office.=20
  h.. Parents and retirees--Your choices as a consumer could be =
controlled by your Internet provider, steering you to their preferred =
services for online banking, health care information, sending photos, =
planning vacations, etc.=20
  i.. Bloggers--Costs will skyrocket to post and share video and audio =
clips--silencing citizen journalists and putting more power in the hands =
of a few corporate-owned media outlets.=20
  To sign the petition to Congress supporting "network neutrality," =
click here:=20
  http://www.civic.moveon.org/save_the_internet/

P.P.S. This excerpt from the New Yorker really sums up this issue well.=20

    In the first decades of the twentieth century, as a national =
telephone network spread across the United States, A.T. & T. adopted a =
policy of "tiered access" for businesses. Companies that paid an extra =
fee got better service: their customers' calls went through immediately, =
were rarely disconnected, and sounded crystal-clear. Those who didn't =
pony up had a harder time making calls out, and people calling them =
sometimes got an "all circuits busy" response. Over time, customers =
gravitated toward the higher-tier companies and away from the ones that =
were more difficult to reach. In effect, A.T. & T.'s policy turned it =
into a corporate kingmaker.

    If you've never heard about this bit of business history, there's a =
good reason: it never happened. Instead, A.T. & T. had to abide by a =
"common carriage" rule: it provided the same quality of service to all, =
and could not favor one customer over another. But, while "tiered =
access" never influenced the spread of the telephone network, it is =
becoming a major issue in the evolution of the Internet.=20

    Until recently, companies that provided Internet access followed a =
de-facto commoncarriage rule, usually called "network neutrality," which =
meant that all Web sites got equal treatment. Network neutrality was =
considered so fundamental to the success of the Net that Michael Powell, =
when he was chairman of the F.C.C., described it as one of the basic =
rules of "Internet freedom." In the past few months, though, companies =
like A.T. & T. and BellSouth have been trying to scuttle it. In the =
future, Web sites that pay extra to providers could receive what =
BellSouth recently called "special treatment," and those that don't =
could end up in the slow lane. One day, BellSouth customers may find =
that, say, NBC.com loads a lot faster than YouTube.com, and that the =
sites BellSouth favors just seem to run more smoothly. Tiered access =
will turn the providers into Internet gatekeepers.[4]=20

Myspace is great, it's an awesome way to keep track of people. It is a 
great way to connect with people that have moved away from the area, or 
have been in jail for a couple years.

Anyway i think it's perfect, it's like a visual address book.

BTW you can greatly enhance your myspace experience by using various 
firefox extensions that disable, flash, video, and javascript.

Remember its all about money on both sides.  I'm sure there are buisnesses

What do I think of this?

I think that the telcos should have several levels of service. Starting 
at free service, where the advertise to you, and throttle your 
bandwidth, block ports and whatever. And then you should have varied 
levels of pay service with varied levels of crap. And then for the 
people that want the "welfare" solution, you should have municipal wi-fi 
and free access at libraries, paid for by tax money. The municipal stuff 
would be pretty limited to protect the innocent. 

For instance the T1 we rent at my work, it costs a bunch, but we can do 
whatever we want.

So basically, pay to play. This is America, after all. It is a free 
market, if you are not happy with Verizon, move to another service. If 
you don't like AOL, then there are thousands of alternatives. The 
government has safeguards to reign in big business, the internet should 
be governed by the same rules, not by some special dispensation.

If you want a "right" to use the internet, go and move to Estonia. But 
remember that you have to learn their ass-backwards language or they'll 
treat you like shit.

I think you're missing the best practice point here of development:

control the internet... ban sex toys... make me look at abortion posters
held by 75 year old men at stop lights...

 Bill would make sale of sex toys illegal in South Carolina SEANNA
ADCOX Associated
Press

*COLUMBIA, S.C. - *Sugar 'N Spice manager Pat Irons says a proposal to
outlaw the sale of sex toys in South Carolina is outrageous.

But banning the sale of sex toys is actually quite common in some Southern
states.

The South Carolina bill, proposed by Republican Rep. Ralph Davenport, would
make it a felony to sell devices used primarily for sexual stimulation and
allow law enforcement to seize sex toys from raided businesses.

The measure would add sex toys to the state's obscenity laws, which already
prohibit the dissemination and advertisement of obscene materials.

People convicted under obscenity laws face up to five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.

South Carolina law borrows from a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling to define
obscene as something "contemporary community standards" determine as
"patently offensive" sexual conduct, which "lacks serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific value."

While Davenport's proposal is probably aimed at shutting down X-rated adult
bookstores, Irons said, it hurts customers of "couples-oriented" stores suc=
h
as her West Columbia shop, which sells everything from lingerie to bridal
shower novelties to lotions.

At Sugar 'N Spice, sex toys are displayed in a separate room. Buyers includ=
e
men and women who "need a little help" because surgery or medical problems
are affecting their marriage, Irons said.

"We've been selling these sex toys for 27 years," she said Friday. "Even
pastors shop in here. They send couples in here they counsel for marriage
problems. It's probably going to hit people like that harder than people
realize."

Davenport, who is from Spartanburg County, did not return several messages
Friday to talk about his bill, which was introduced last month. No other
legislator has signed on as a co-sponsor and its passage this year seems
unlikely.

Recent police raids in Davenport's county have targeted adult-oriented
businesses.

The sheriff's office there seized movies, sex toys, sexual-enhancement pill=
s
and surveillance tapes from two businesses in January.

One of the stores, Priscilla's, sued the sheriff's office, claiming the rai=
d
violated constitutional rights and asked for the return of the seized items=
.
Sheriff Chuck Wright refused.

The case has not yet gone to trial, Maj. Dan Johnson said.

Johnson said he knew nothing of Davenport's proposal and was unsure how it
could help their investigations, which involve undercover detectives rentin=
g
movies or buying magazines and prosecutors determining whether they're
obscene.

"We're focused on the hard-core magazines, videos ... the hard-core porn,"
he said.

Other states that ban the sell of sex toys include Alabama, Georgia,
Mississippi and Texas, said Mark Lopez, an attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Union.

Alabama's law banning the sale of sex toys has been circulating through the
courts since its passage in 1998. U.S. District Judge Lynwood Smith Jr.
twice ruled against the law, holding that it violated the constitutional
right to privacy, but the state won both times on appeal.

In February 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case, which i=
s
back in the lower courts.

"People think it's distasteful. It makes for good campaign fodder and
panders to the conservative side of people. That's why we see the laws in
the South," Lopez said.

The ACLU got involved in the case, he said, to "keep the government out of
the bedroom."

Though the laws don't punish people for owning sex toys, banning their sale
is a backdoor attempt to discourage their use, Lopez said.

"People have a fundamental right to engage in lawful sexual practices in th=
e
privacy of their home," Lopez said. "It's not like this stuff is available
in Macy's. Kids aren't allowed in. You or I wouldn't accidentally walk into
one."

<div>
<h1>Bill would make sale of sex toys illegal in South Carolina</h1>
<h5>SEANNA ADCOX</h5>
<h6>Associated Press</h6>
<p><b><span class=3D"dateline">COLUMBIA, S.C.</span><span class=3D"dateline=
-separator"> - </span></b>Sugar 'N Spice manager Pat Irons says a proposal =
to outlaw the sale of sex toys in South Carolina is outrageous.</p>
<p>But banning the sale of sex toys is actually quite common in some Southe=
rn states.</p>
<p>The South Carolina bill, proposed by Republican Rep. Ralph Davenport, wo=
uld make it a felony to sell devices used primarily for sexual stimulation =
and allow law enforcement to seize sex toys from raided businesses.</p>

<p>The measure would add sex toys to the state's obscenity laws, which alre=
ady prohibit the dissemination and advertisement of obscene materials.</p>
<p>People convicted under obscenity laws face up to five years in prison an=
d a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>South Carolina law borrows from a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling to defi=
ne obscene as something &quot;contemporary community standards&quot; determ=
ine as &quot;patently offensive&quot; sexual conduct, which &quot;lacks ser=
ious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.&quot;
</p>
<p>While Davenport's proposal is probably aimed at shutting down X-rated ad=
ult bookstores, Irons said, it hurts customers of &quot;couples-oriented&qu=
ot; stores such as her West Columbia shop, which sells everything from ling=
erie to bridal shower novelties to lotions.
</p>
<p>At Sugar 'N Spice, sex toys are displayed in a separate room. Buyers inc=
lude men and women who &quot;need a little help&quot; because surgery or me=
dical problems are affecting their marriage, Irons said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been selling these sex toys for 27 years,&quot; she said Fri=
day. &quot;Even pastors shop in here. They send couples in here they counse=
l for marriage problems. It's probably going to hit people like that harder=
 than people realize.&quot;
</p>
<p>Davenport, who is from Spartanburg County, did not return several messag=
es Friday to talk about his bill, which was introduced last month. No other=
 legislator has signed on as a co-sponsor and its passage this year seems u=
nlikely.
</p>
<p>Recent police raids in Davenport's county have targeted adult-oriented b=
usinesses.</p>
<p>The sheriff's office there seized movies, sex toys, sexual-enhancement p=
ills and surveillance tapes from two businesses in January.</p>
<p>One of the stores, Priscilla's, sued the sheriff's office, claiming the =
raid violated constitutional rights and asked for the return of the seized =
items. Sheriff Chuck Wright refused.</p>
<p>The case has not yet gone to trial, Maj. Dan Johnson said.</p>
<p>Johnson said he knew nothing of Davenport's proposal and was unsure how =
it could help their investigations, which involve undercover detectives ren=
ting movies or buying magazines and prosecutors determining whether they're=
 obscene.
</p>
<p>&quot;We're focused on the hard-core magazines, videos ... the hard-core=
 porn,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other states that ban the sell of sex toys include Alabama, Georgia, Mis=
sissippi and Texas, said Mark Lopez, an attorney for the American Civil Lib=
erties Union.</p>
<p>Alabama's law banning the sale of sex toys has been circulating through =
the courts since its passage in 1998. U.S. District Judge Lynwood Smith Jr.=
 twice ruled against the law, holding that it violated the constitutional r=
ight to privacy, but the state won both times on appeal.
</p>
<p>In February 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case, whic=
h is back in the lower courts.</p>
<p>&quot;People think it's distasteful. It makes for good campaign fodder a=
nd panders to the conservative side of people. That's why we see the laws i=
n the South,&quot; Lopez said.</p>
<p>The ACLU got involved in the case, he said, to &quot;keep the government=
 out of the bedroom.&quot;</p>
<p>Though the laws don't punish people for owning sex toys, banning their s=
ale is a backdoor attempt to discourage their use, Lopez said.</p>
<p>&quot;People have a fundamental right to engage in lawful sexual practic=
es in the privacy of their home,&quot; Lopez said. &quot;It's not like this=
 stuff is available in Macy's. Kids aren't allowed in. You or I wouldn't ac=
cidentally walk into one.&quot;

<div>Do you buy books online,&nbsp;use Google, or download to an Ipod?&nbsp=
;These activities, plus MoveOn's online organizing ability, will be&nbsp;hu=
rt if Congress&nbsp;passes a radical law that&nbsp;gives giant corporations=
 more control over the Internet.=20
<p>Internet providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon are lobbying Congress hard =
to&nbsp;gut Network Neutrality, the&nbsp;Internet's First Amendment.&nbsp;N=
et Neutrality prevents AT&amp;T from&nbsp;choosing which websites open most=
 easily for you based on which site pays AT&amp;T more. Amazon doesn't have=
 to outbid Barnes &amp; Noble for the right to work more properly on your c=
omputer.
</p>
<p>If Net Neutrality is gutted,&nbsp;MoveOn either pays protection money to=
 dominant Internet providers&nbsp;or risks that online activism tools don't=
 work for members. Amazon and Google either pay&nbsp;protection money&nbsp;=
or&nbsp;risk that their websites process slowly on your computer. That why =

Subject: {pb-cle} list

last night i overreacted and should have given a warning.  no more 
political-religous crap on the list.  that is not what pbcle is for and 
it seems mostly to be what you have to say on there.   it was funny to a 
point, but now is annoying and i've had list members asking for your 
removal.  you're unblocked and can resub, but keep it on topic.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} KoolAid roll call

I guess that's my issue with MySpace, its too damn overwhelming in too
many ways. I'd much rather just subscribe to some folks' RSS feeds for
their blogs if they're people I don't keep up with much, but I'd much
rather actually talk to as many people as possible. I sometimes feel
as though something like myspace actually keeps me more distant from
the people I'd rather keep in contact with as now I don't have reason
to talk to them. Call me old fashioned I guess.

There are people with 800+ friends, it sorta defeats the purpose if
you ask me. I'd rather keep my friends close, and shiny crappy myspace
pages away from them.

I dunno, maybe its time for a new project for me.

i use adblock plus.  i block any adfarm that has blinky flashy ads or 
ads that look like dialogue boxes.  i also block annoying avatars and 
sig pictures on bboards.  i also block that goddamn song player on 
myspace.  its supposed to have a setting to not play by default, but 
that option doesn't work (like so many things on myspace).

someone did setup a pbcle profile on there, i'm not sure what it is 
offhand and i'm not gonna thumb through my bloated friends list on there :P

Dude, the Proximotron rocks... guy got in trouble for making it so 
it's no longer around.  It works as a proxy server on your computer 
and actively strips crap out of html and gives you add free 
stuff.  see if you can find it.

Can you ban email addresses?  Dunno i've never really had to worry
about banning people on my li'l forum.  But I thought you could only
ban ip addresses and block usernames.  Or approve every new signup
manually.

What's the name of the program that was based off of mozilla I think
that it removes all ads and pictures and css and makes everything
shades of grey so it doesn't look like a webpage but it integrates
into whatever app is currently running.  Hit some key and it goes
away.  Basically a way to goof off at work. :)

When microsoft can't design a good web browser, you expect a 14 year old 
to design a good web page?

Myspace is not a browsing experience, it is a social networking site, 
and i think it works pretty well as a social networking site. The Acid2 
test is a browsing experience, and it is well designed by a professional.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Slowing down the Internets

The problem with this is that AT&T and Verizon aren't the only
bandwidth providers on the Internet. The logistics of doing something
like this is something next to impossible, if they are to keep
non-verizon companies from suing the pants off them.

Here's an example. As a Roadrunner customer, my ISP is peering with a
few other tier one providers. Let's say for example, TWTelecom, AT&T,
MCI and they have a connection to the SBC NAP in Chicago.(*note, this
is just an example, I dunno who they peer with).

Its entirely possible that two of the three providers do not have some
sort of "tax" for carrying the bandwidth of say, google or apple.
Right now, there are lowest cost routing protocols for the peering
with these providers, but what the problem would be is determining=20
cost for a line where you don't know what's happening as far as
content splits go. You get to a point where AT&T would effect
customers of downstream ISP's, cutting off phone calls, video
conferences, dropping emails, etc. At this point, you either
completely succumb to AT&T, or completely drop them as a peer. Since
about no one peers with one provider for a lot of reasons, I'd venture
to say they'd get dropped in the cases of most larger ISP's.

Another problem is that this would screw the pooch as far as "buying
American" goes, turning the entire software industry into overseas
ventures. You can't tax where US law doesn't come into play. The
revenue would be great for these selected telcos, but the tax revenue
from this would be a giant loss.

These giant telcos are only screwing themselves on this matter. The
fact is that the technology exists to completely eradicate their need
for being at this point, and they're running scared after being really
late to the convergence game.

I think Google has forseen this, and its why they're beta testing
wireless community access. Things like community meshes over
802.11a/b/g/n are going to become more common, as are SIP based
telephony services as time progresses. The network edge is
disappearing, and this is where they make their money.

i dont know what 14 year old candy ravers you've been hanging out with, but
most of the jagoffs with shitty html/css/extensive youtube/animated gifs on
their myspace pages are in our peer group.

anything i open in my browser is a browsing experience.  you're making an

purpose is for social networking.  for me, the number one requirement for
good social networking is concise and clear communication.  if anything, th=

shitty html/css/blah blah would make me not want to add someone into my
friends, so therefore the antithesis of stifling social networking is
accomplished by current design.

now this list, in its prime as well as now, still has value as a
communication instrument due to the fact that it doesnt allow for
distraction by text, images, animation, attachments, and instead you must
rely upon your message being conveyed clearly.

because people have their own spot on the web for their individuality.  So

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Associated Press
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; *COLUMBIA, S.C. - *Sugar 'N Spice manager Pat Irons says a=
 proposal to<br>&gt; outlaw the sale of sex toys in South Carolina is outra=
geous.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But banning the sale of sex toys is actually quite c=
ommon in some
<br>&gt; Southern states.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The South Carolina bill, proposed=
 by Republican Rep. Ralph Davenport,<br>&gt; would make it a felony to sell=
 devices used primarily for sexual<br>&gt; stimulation and allow law enforc=
ement to seize sex toys from raided
<br>&gt; businesses.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The measure would add sex toys to the =
state's obscenity laws, which<br>&gt; already prohibit the dissemination an=
d advertisement of obscene materials.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; People convicted unde=
r obscenity laws face up to five years in prison
<br>&gt; and a $10,000 fine.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; South Carolina law borrows fro=
m a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling to<br>&gt; define obscene as something &=
quot;contemporary community standards&quot;<br>&gt; determine as &quot;pate=
ntly offensive&quot; sexual conduct, which &quot;lacks serious
<br>&gt; literary, artistic, political or scientific value.&quot;<br>&gt;<b=
r>&gt; While Davenport's proposal is probably aimed at shutting down X-rate=
d<br>&gt; adult bookstores, Irons said, it hurts customers of &quot;couples=
-oriented&quot;
<br>&gt; stores such as her West Columbia shop, which sells everything from=
<br>&gt; lingerie to bridal shower novelties to lotions.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; At=
 Sugar 'N Spice, sex toys are displayed in a separate room. Buyers<br>&gt; =
include men and women who &quot;need a little help&quot; because surgery or
<br>&gt; medical problems are affecting their marriage, Irons said.<br>&gt;=
<br>&gt; &quot;We've been selling these sex toys for 27 years,&quot; she sa=
id Friday.<br>&gt; &quot;Even pastors shop in here. They send couples in he=
re they counsel for
<br>&gt; marriage problems. It's probably going to hit people like that har=
der<br>&gt; than people realize.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Davenport, who is fr=
om Spartanburg County, did not return several<br>&gt; messages Friday to ta=
lk about his bill, which was introduced last
<br>&gt; month. No other legislator has signed on as a co-sponsor and its<b=
r>&gt; passage this year seems unlikely.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Recent police raid=
s in Davenport's county have targeted adult-oriented<br>&gt; businesses.
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The sheriff's office there seized movies, sex toys, sexual=
-enhancement<br>&gt; pills and surveillance tapes from two businesses in Ja=
nuary.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One of the stores, Priscilla's, sued the sheriff's o=
ffice, claiming
<br>&gt; the raid violated constitutional rights and asked for the return o=
f<br>&gt; the seized items. Sheriff Chuck Wright refused.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; T=
he case has not yet gone to trial, Maj. Dan Johnson said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; J=
ohnson said he knew nothing of Davenport's proposal and was unsure
<br>&gt; how it could help their investigations, which involve undercover<b=
r>&gt; detectives renting movies or buying magazines and prosecutors<br>&gt=
; determining whether they're obscene.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;We're focused =
on the hard-core magazines, videos ... the hard-core
<br>&gt; porn,&quot; he said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Other states that ban the sel=
l of sex toys include Alabama, Georgia,<br>&gt; Mississippi and Texas, said=
 Mark Lopez, an attorney for the American<br>&gt; Civil Liberties Union.
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Alabama's law banning the sale of sex toys has been circul=
ating<br>&gt; through the courts since its passage in 1998. U.S. District J=
udge<br>&gt; Lynwood Smith Jr. twice ruled against the law, holding that it
<br>&gt; violated the constitutional right to privacy, but the state won bo=
th<br>&gt; times on appeal.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In February 2005, the U.S. Supr=
eme Court declined to hear the case,<br>&gt; which is back in the lower cou=
rts.
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;People think it's distasteful. It makes for good cam=
paign fodder and<br>&gt; panders to the conservative side of people. That's=
 why we see the laws<br>&gt; in the South,&quot; Lopez said.<br>&gt;<br>
&gt; The ACLU got involved in the case, he said, to &quot;keep the governme=
nt<br>&gt; out of the bedroom.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Though the laws don't =
punish people for owning sex toys, banning their<br>&gt; sale is a backdoor=
 attempt to discourage their use, Lopez said.
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;People have a fundamental right to engage in lawful =
sexual practices<br>&gt; in the privacy of their home,&quot; Lopez said. &q=
uot;It's not like this stuff<br>&gt; is available in Macy's. Kids aren't al=
lowed in. You or I wouldn't
<br>&gt; accidentally walk into one.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<=

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Slowing down the Internets

That's what I was thinking too.  This would be an all or nothing  
thing.  The internets are smart enough to know that at any point  
along it's route to the destination, there could be several different  
paths it could take.  If your data has a choice between an AT&T line  
that you have to pay for improved service, or a LEVEL3 line that  
doesn't require any money and is faster, it's going to go that  
route.  And if this is happening at "the last leg" (ie, what the  
actual web server uses for it's internet) Companies are going to say  
F U and go to a different carrier that isn't going to charge them for  
the "privlege" of using their line.  Datacenters have serveral  
different carriers to choose from.  I think the datacenter we have  
downtown can choose between 7 different carriers because of where  
it's located.  Now if everyone did this, then we'd be screwed,  
although I don't think that would happen.  If I was in charge of a  
carrier I wouldn't and advertise the fact that we don't do any  
quality of service filtering and everyone has equal opportunity on  
the line.

I really don't understand how they can justify this.  Carriers still  
charge companies based on bandwidth usage.  So my website that maybe  
uses 2 gb of bandwidth a month isn't going to get charged extra.  But  
a place like myspace that uses terrabyes of bandwidth is going to pay  
more.  That extra money is used to maintain the routers so they can  
handle all that bandwidth.  2gb a month is a drop in the bucket in  
comparison.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} KoolAid roll call

I remember in the late 80s, everyone thought that anyone who had an
email address was a geek, and I heard MANY people say "I'll never have
email, I dont need it"...

Anyhow myspace is the new business card + email... I'm married and
even I can see that it's tough to date without a myspace. Your myspace
says alot about you... if your myspace is just full of people you
never knew or never met, or just big tittied girls, that tells me
something about you... If you've got 10000 friends and 2 comments...
hay. that says something too...

I was afraid to get on it at first as well.. mostly thoughts about how
I didn't really know many people and that would show up there... but
since I've been on there I've met so many old friends, and new ones...
It's worth it... unless you really want to be a hermit and / or avoid
old friends. I think it's great that I've managed to hook up with
people I knew that are now literally living all over the globe... next
time I plan a trip to europe or japan I'll have some cool stops to
make... On the down side there are a couple of people I'd rather not
have heard from that have found me... that's life though, I'm not
gonna sit inside my house and hide from anyone anymore than I would on
the web.

Anyhow it's not a place to have intellectual conversation amongst a
group of peers, it's just a business/friend card and a safe email that
you can block bozos from easily. It's value as email is arguably
superior to classic email because you have a little more confirmation
that the person you're talking to is the actual person that you think
it is... based on thier friends and pictures and space design.

Now... if only the spaces were all 3d... :)

The layout is bad, the useability is pitiful, and letting kids write

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} KoolAid roll call

I beg to differ. I have a girlfriend and a kid on the way, she has
never had a myspace profile.  (neither will my child, more on that
later). I have friends that don't own a cell phone, let alone a
computer, or if they have one, have internet access at home.

Wasn't it Jerry Garcia that said something like anyone can meet up
over a good meal and a beer and have things to talk about?

And yes, my kid is getting a 386 with a copy of netcat on a linux
bootable floppy for internet access. If they can get to myspace, they
deserve it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} let the mp3 vs vinyl argument commence

Agreed, although I hated the cleaning and storing of vinyl, and
repeatedly making tapes of LPs so I didn't wear out the vinyl...
buying needles, breaking needles, breaking records, warping records...
storing them... the list goes on.

I celebrated the day that vinyl gave way to CDs... (everything except
the hefty price they started charging for CDs... I still remember the
empty promises that the price of CDs would go down as technology
improved.)

I only buy CDs, then I rip em and archive em. It kinda reminds me of
the lp->tape process but alot faster and more painless, and making
MP3s is cheap :)

I was told by a DC acquaintence that the outcome of the so called "Brand
X" case has already set the precedent for tiered pricing on the Internet. 
It may be too little too late...She tried to scare me to sign a petition
last summer saying that one day I might not be able to use Google.

i'm down, last time we did it in Cranberry at quaker steak, that wasnt too
bad for most people i dont think?

i think going to Sharon would be just as far for the cleveland/akron people
and further for the pittsburgh people (about an hour and 15-hour and a
half)...

anyone got an accurate drive time to Cranberry from Cleve/Akron?

Google says about 2.5 hours, but I can't remember if that sounds about
right or not. It appears as though Warren is more along the lines of a
halfway point. Anyway, its about 3.5 hours from me.

Why not just alternate it from city to city?

well i remember the first CDs running 18-22$.  at one point best buy was 
selling 95% of their cds for 12$ or less.  that is until the labels came 
in and forced them to up the prices or something.  i dont even know what 
a cd costs any more really because there just aren't any out there i 
care enough to look for.

I thought this came up before.  So guess I'm still stuck with my POS
cable modem service.  It's been a couple weeks since I last complained
about the service, about time to call again so they can say "o your
power level is low" and send somone out and fixes it for a few days
and then it sucks again. *sigh*

Best Buy was selling cd's for $12 or less as loss leaders -- which is =

We've actually been seeing that in vinyl as well.  Specifically in drum =

they go up to an average of $11.49 when we have to re-order them.

No, were listening.  Just dont forget...
 
vinyl = art
cd  = wedding DJ
 
Ask a true turntableist what's up.
I see f@ck ing whack ass cddjs on BET
makin like their cutting their way to the top.
Buffalo stance with their jake posse in the back nodding heads.
These guys must be in the 18-20 something range.
I just bow my head in shame, and wonder where the true art has gone.
And if any future heads will ever realize and appreciate...
the old school.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} KoolAid roll call

I set it up, but never kept up with it, so I deleted it.

I do have around 700 friends on there, which makes for nice BSP, when I put
comments on their pages to download mixes.

My last mix is getting around 25+ downloads a day mostly because of myspace.

i use adblock plus.  i block any adfarm that has blinky flashy ads or 
ads that look like dialogue boxes.  i also block annoying avatars and 
sig pictures on bboards.  i also block that goddamn song player on 
myspace.  its supposed to have a setting to not play by default, but 
that option doesn't work (like so many things on myspace).

someone did setup a pbcle profile on there, i'm not sure what it is 
offhand and i'm not gonna thumb through my bloated friends list on there :P

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri May 05                         A-TRAK                         Cleveland

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

alex bau - biography
 

alex´s dj-sets, full of energy and devotion, turned dancefloors into 
total excess since 1992. his versatile selection of tracks, ranging from 
minimal to more hard edged technotracks, always develop a flow by 
keeping his very own but versatile style. The co-founder of toneman 
always gets people on his side until the last record has been played, 
mostly after several hours of extreme-partying

this approach to music is the result of a long career in the underground 
dance music industry, which began in the early 90's when spinning 
different kinds of dance music in his hometown and neighboring cities. 
in the very beginning, he recalls introducing early techno into his sets  
with moderate success, but he nevertheless dedicated his entire career 
to techno music. alex's musical aspirations have been inspired by 
composers such as roland orzabald (tear for fears), martin gore (depeche 
mode) and more ebm or 80ies synthiepop acts just to name a few.

in his sets, alex obeys to the old-school ethics of not just playing the 
hits but creating a story, even if he sometimes has to squeeze the whole 
set into a couple of hours. his experience as a radio- and club-resident 
dj from 1994 to 1996 and later on gigs throughout germany, austria, 
switzerland, czech republic, croatia, yugoslavia, hungary, poland, 
holland, canada or even romania or brasil has led him to win the hearts 
of an audience that is constantly growing in number. no matter what 
country on the world, booking alex means booking high quality, always 
grooving, sometimes minimal, sometimes hard techno that is brought to 
the audience by an artist with extraordinary solid skills on the decks 
paired with a huge amount of entertainment factor by the dj himself. 
this has also enabled him to apply his dance floor knowledge in the 
production studio where he creates potent club tracks with his partner 
and label mate sven dedek under monikers as basic implant, electric 
envoy and alex bau when these are his proper productions. Especially his 
first album .connected. was a clear statement by alex how .pure techno. 
looks like on his definition: versatile, entertaining, 
dancefloor-compatible and technically produced on the maximum level. no 
wonder that .connected. appears in the playlist of numerrous top-dj`s.

alex has released eps for fine audio, parasound, energy industries, 
rotation (dave angel's), toneman (his own), clr (chris liebing`s), 
pv-records (pascal feos), predicaments (justin berkovi`s) and default 
recordings. beside this he has remixed tracks for chris liebing and 
pascal feos. in addition to producing tracks for labels all around the 
globe, alex always consists on being recognized as a dj in a different 
kind of view beside the fact that of course his production style also 
reflects his musical preferences . pure techno, sometimes minimal, 
sometimes fat. in his eyes, the quality of a dj can not be measured with 
the number of releases.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).

UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB

DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

youngstown is a good spot.  takes about an hour to get there from
pittsburgh.  how much of a dive is this place?  is it like Pogo's dive, or

i haven't been there in a few years, it was a dark quiet bar usually 
with not alot of anything going on, but had really good wings and 
fries.  straubs on tap :)

i guess they do bands on the weekends now and not sure if it's changed.

http://www.theroyaloaks.com/

shit, says the kitchen is temporarily closed, but parts of the site seem 
out of date.   hmmm.  if ytown seems central, maybe get ahold of them 
and see if the kitchen has reopened....

[OUTPUT MESSAGE] - Live PA - Born in Queens, New York, in 1983, spending his

Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka
Outputmessage) can be given that rare title of "young musical prodigy." 
During
his time in New Jersey, he first became fascinated with a broad range of 
music,
eventually keying in on electronic; and when his family got its first 
computer
in the summer of 1998, he began making music on his own. Now, while a
mathematics graduate student at Virginia Tech, he spends his off time 
writing
tight, hook-laden tracks. Outputmessage debuted with a remix of Dabrye on 
the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a track ("Bernards 
Song") on Ghostly's Idol Tryouts
compilation before even turning 20. Later the Oneiros EP was released on 
Echelon
Productions. This year "Sommeil" was released on the Ghostly's Idol Tryouts 
Two
compilation and Outputmessage's debut LP, Nebulae, is set to drop this June 
on
Melodic.  Outputmessage was also recently selected to be in URB's Next 100.

::: OUR VISION :::

This is the first of two weekend-long camping festivals The Chilluminati
will be creating in 2006. Both will be held near Black River Falls, close t=
o
the heart of the psychedelic tribes of Wisconsin and those of Iowa,
Minnesota, Ontario and Illinois.

The Native Americans of western Wisconsin built huge earthworks that we now
know as effigy mounds. These immense forms, carved into the earth, were
symbols of The Divine. Just as the tribes built their mounds, we create
these parties as Cosmic Condensates. Our Music, Dance, Light and Love form =
a
sacred structure in Space and Time, a microcosmic celebration of The
Infinite.

Come join with us this year by helping us to invoke the Five Elements:
Earth - our beautiful new party location near Black River Falls is known an=
d
loved by many
Air - The Music, both Psychedelic Trance and Chill/Downtempo/Ambient, is th=
e
air we breathe.
Fire - Deco in three Dimensions: Art, Light, Projection. As well as Fire an=
d
Kinetic performances.
Water - Healers, the psychedelic people, the ambience, community, the
beautiful something that you can't put your finger on...
Spirit - the Unseen, the Energy Field, Imaginal Realm Manifest

WE PROVIDE: 2 stages of sound and light, 4 days of camping in a beautiful
natural environment (rain or shine), running water, bathrooms and hot
showers, full vending (including alcohol for those 21+).

YOU PROVIDE : a tent, enough food and beverages for the weekend (or some
cash - food and beverages will be available for sale), NO GLASS, NO DRUGS,
NO PETS, NO FIREWOOD (firewood can be purchased on-site).

Vendors : Vending is $50 plus admission. We encourage vending of all kinds,
but all vending proposals are subject to Chilluminati Crew approval. Please
email us with your proposal: crew (AT) chilluminati (DOT) org.

camping & volunteer info TBA @ www.chilluminati.org

LEAVE NO TRACE EVENT.

EXP036 - VARIOUS ARTISTS - THE RHYTHM METHOD DLP
http://www.experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D114

First Experimedia unleashed a collection of lush ambient soundscapes,
to commemorate their 25th release. Then they unveiled an abrassive
noise compilation, aimed at proprietors of artistic censorship. And
now, Experimedia returns with their greatest compilation yet... the
double LP-length 'Rhythm Method', featuring close to 160 minutes of
new & exclusive music from mostly new and/or unheard artists in
addition to a few established artists. Thematically, this release
continues the tradition of attacking a specific niche of electronica,
with the focus now on beat-driven electro, squelchy glitch-hop, raw
and rugged d'n'b... basically, if it has a pulse, it is being
represented. Whether you like to dance, nod yer head, or just sit back
and chill to some ear candy...this is for you. Design by Jack Rabbit.

I do not know what is going on with Berlin, but they have really  
dropped the ball on the Love Parade for the past few years.  Not only  
is there no festival in Berlin, but they dropped their licensing for  
the name so none of the international events will either.  San  
Francisco seems to be continuing with a similar event, despite the  
name change, but what about everyone else?  Is this finally the end  
of the Love Parade after struggling for the past few years?

Koolaid this weekend and perhaps DEMF too?  Watch out or you may  
become a jaded raver again ;)

Oddly enough, we are going, The Orb (a.k.a. Le Petit Orb) suckered us  
in.  We booked our hotel on Priceline and got a room at the Marriot  
Renaissance for $100/night.  Most of the hotels closest to Hart Plaza  
are already booked solid so going through Priceline seemed like the  
best option.  Luckily it worked out very well.

<i>Greetings from the crew that brought you Love Parade San Francisco '04
and '05!</i> <br><br>
This is an update on what's been happening at Love HQ in our efforts to
bring America's premiere electronic music event back to the streets of
San Francisco. <br><br>
<b>We are proud to announce the Love will return Fall, 2006!</b>
<br><br>
Once again we'll be hosting the city's, country's and world's best
electronic music DJ's and music producers with a full on free parade down
the heart of San Francisco, festival at the Civic Center plaza, take over
of City Hall, and more pre-parties, after parties, and after-after
parties this side of WMC. <br><br>
This parade and festival will not bear the name 'Love Parade' this year,
as Love Parade Berlin, who we were licensed through the previous 2 years,
did not renew -any- of their world wide licenses not already under
contract so they could focus on their own event this July, the first Love
Parade Berlin in 2 years. We all remain on great terms and wish each
other amazing events! <br><br>
Left with the decision of what to do, the same team that organized
previous SF LP events felt we couldn't let the momentum, work and
excitement of our first 2 amazingly successful turn outs take a year off
to wait and see what happens with Berlin next year. We're excited to
bring the same concept that makes Love Parade so amazing, and make it our
own, and take it up a notch with a fresh start building on past efforts.
<br><br>
An outdoor all day parade and festival showcasing electronic dance music,
and the wonderful culture that surrounds it, a culture that values a lot
of things the world needs right now - unity, friendliness, respect,
tolerance, spirit, cooperation, and fun. You're invited once again to
make that shine, so get ready for more love! <br><br>
The original founder of Love Parade Berlin, Dr. Motte told us: &quot;I
would be happy to work close and direct together with you to keep the
spirit of loveparade alive beyond all borders.&quot; <br><br>
Sounds like a plan! We'll be hearing more from Dr. Motte.... <br>

It's really fuicked up because I was just on his web site a few weeks 
ago and there was no mention of any dates anywhere not in 
europe.  So, needless to say I'm a bit skeptical.

who's all going?  i just need a floor to not sleep on.  Wonder if I 
can still stay awake for 4 days.. might be getting too old.

A very good party, one of the best i've been to in PA. Colin Pierce 
rocked it, Tronix rocked it.
The sound an lights inside were a little over the top so i hung out on 
the balcony all night.

Lets do it again shall we?

my picashures are at
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/2006-04-29-kool-aid-electrolaid-punch

quasi-review cut-n-pasted from mah blog:

last night we went down to pgh for electrolaid koolade punch (yah, i 
keep screwing up the name, dont have such weird names and i wont!)

never heard of the place before - 9 over 9th.  awesome venue.  like a 
mid sized room with an outdoor balcony for the 2nd stage.  you could see 
across pgh from the balcony stage. very nice.  i forgot about the 
outdoor part so i left my fleece in the car.  whooopsie!  could have 
used that coz it did get chilly outside in the wee hours....

music was pretty solid thru the night.  no heather heart (yey!) so 
frankie bones did a 3 hour set, covering her time.   normally frankie 
bones puts me to sleep and i never understood why promoters would pay 
this guy to kill a dance floor, but this set was hard bangin shit with 
some aceeeeeiiid thrown in here and there.  i think he played all of the 
dave clarke reds.

cutups playing what he plays, todd k doing the rewind whether geoff 
wanted it or not.  hahah.  colin/naoko were pretty solid.  ratana and 
kirby dropped some fun bass rollers.

an interesting observation was that the place went bonkers when sirius 
went on, and cleared out when he was done.   read what you want into 
that. (hardcore will never die!)

stacy dressed as tangerine, the mega-orange kool-aid.   it was the hawtness

saw lots of people i havent seen in ages.  silverraver, bagina, poopy 
the bday girl, polar bear, victor the old security guy.  and shitloads more.

one interesting thing was i talked to probably 10 kids who said this was 
their first party ever.  where these kids came from is beyond me.  we 
did run one kid home, so i got to pick his brain about why he came out.  
comes down to he knew someone involved with the party, but he really had 
no idea what to expect.  everyone i talked to loved it, some wanted to 
know when the next one was (tricky question!)

after that we went to the kellys house and chilled--to uber-happy music 
because dave clarke is psychosis inducing.  i wouldn't believe it but i 
did see it, scurry.  damn.  so we popped in the 'cheddar vengeance vol 
3' mix to make things uberplurry.  always a good time at the kellys.  
caught up with everyone.  met new people.  saw old people.  it was a 
very good night.  hopefully pgh can follow up from this and have more 
parties like this.

Are you a fan of 80s electro, Miami bass, and electroclash? Do you like 
Shannon,
Egyptian Lover, Cybotron, and Breakin II: Electronic Boogaloo? How about
Fischerspooner, Peaches, Freezepop, and Gil Mantera's Party Dream? Do you like
vocoders and pitchshifters, pulsing break beats, and songs about unicorns and
'girls gone wild'?

Then you'll definitely want to check out Los Angeles duo CAPTAIN AHAB
(http://www.captain-ahab.com). Their 2004 album 'The Sex is Next' is one of the
best electronic-dance albums of recent memory - XLR8R and Muzik magazines loved
it, Diesel Jeans gave its approval, and Hefty Records picked up a track from it
for a compilation - and the new 'After the Rain My Heart Still Dreams' is
pretty good, too.

They'll be here with L.A. indie electro-box knob-twiddling wizard BOOKS ON 
TAPE [http://rollerderbysuperstar.com/beatpunk/], and locals LORD GRUNGE (the 
charismatic rapper of Grand Buffet) and 8 CYLINDER 
[http://rhinoplex.org/8cylinder/] (the man responsible for the awesome 'Jagoff 
Uprising' double vinyl comp!).

Thu May 4 8 pm all ages show only $6!
Garfield Artworks, 4931 Penn Avenue
