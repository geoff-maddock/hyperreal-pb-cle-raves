Right on - ORTHO was QUITE the evening of entertainment!!!  I wished it 
could have gone off at the northside location, but when it did happen, it 
turned into one of my favorite house-partys ever.  To those whose house 
was used - thanks. :)

For those who didn't stay - yes it did get busted at the house, around 
4:00 - but it lasted longer than I suspected it would...I really think 
people are tired of all these busted partys recently, and i think 
somethings going to happen soon to try to right this wrong....

I'm not sure, because i wasn't there yet, but I think this was my friend 
John aka DJ Product 19 - he really has lots of nice tracks, but he's not 
used to spinning on technics, so that might have thrown him off at first. 
I know he's putting out a mix tape of progressive trance soon that I 
would definately recommend to check out.

YES! YES! YES! I stepped in just in time for d-cypol, and my timing was 
perfect.  His style of happy hardcore is like a snickers: it really 
satisfys you!  It was hard to breath dancing so hard in that muggy sweaty 
basement, but it was worth it. :P  
Then skinner came up with some insanely great gabber and noisy industrial 
strength stuff!  I was in heaven.  Or at least some pleasureful 
not-so-holy place.  I hope pittsburgh can get to hear more of this kind 
(and other kinds) of hardcore and gabber on a regular basis, its really a 
powerful kind of music that's been just left alone too long. ;)

Exactly my sentiments ryu. :)

Its been floating around that Deadly Budda will be making an appearance 
this summer, I don't really know tha lowdown yet - anybody else?

Well, also have to mention - thanks and props go out to the Jive Turkeys 
for putting on a fiiiine event, even when the original space was messed 
up.  ;)

I know this has been tried @ other schools (don't know how well it
worked) but someone in pittsburgh should try and start a "rave" club @
there school.

Before yinz all start shouting at me ... here are da pluses:
+most schools have locations that student organizations are allowd to use 
    (cmu has the a drill deck which has been often used for parties)
+you could get funding for dj's etc 
+possible use of school sound equipement 

i know that some organizations here @ cmu have thrown school wide events,
(such as ASA and SPIRT) ... i just think it would be cool to have an
organization dedicated to it ;)

minus:
-I'll let y'all come up wit these

some of those hello my name is sticker things.  If anyone has any suggestions
drop me a line.  I just hope that i can make it to FA2 now.

Anyways i should be there, i'll break my back trying atleast so let for a car
or tent decked out in some shit and i'll still be brining my 25 pounds of
blowpops.  I don't know about all of you who are going but i am very excited
about this party and i am not going to let some fuckin asshole who fucked up my
car ruin this weekend.

Anyways it's late, i'll write more later when i get some sleep and figure out

Well 'da jive turkeyz had quite an interesting weekend.(This is gonna be long)
1st the permit denial was a real letdown. I worked my ass off to get the
damn things and then they were revoked. It sucked. I was going to go ahead
and do it anyway but the city has a bug up their asses for raves in
Pittsburgh ever since TunnelVision. So the cops were on me like flys on
shit when I started setting the equipment up. One cop threatend to arrest
me granted I was ignoring their permit denial. But when I try to work with
the city I get screwed. So I figured perhaps I should just break down the
equipment and try to find another location... this was @ around 8pm and the
party was scheduled for 10pm. My transportation had left me there with my
sound system and other miscellaneous items and was not scheduled to be back
until around 9:30 or 10pm so I had to desperatly find a ride. I got on my
phone and called around to see if I could do it elsewhere. Around 9:50 i
finally got the green light to use a house in Highland Park. Ortho was
changed from what was supposed to be a party in a back alley in an
Industrial District(NO NOISE WOULD HAVE BOTHERED A SOUL) in the northside.
BUT NO the city denied me. So we set up and got it rollin'
the Djs in the Basement where I resided most of the nite... me being a
hardcore junkie... was insane Product 19 opened up spun WITH NO HEADPHONES
and still kicked ass!!! Then Loki went on and played some very hard Trance
then Eric Justin played some real nice Detriot Techno with a sprinkle of
Hard House. Then the basement BLEW UP!!! d.Cypol went on and the place was
jumpin' happy hardcore for your nutz. And then Skinner from NYC with the
frankfurt sound he was excellent Thank you Skinner for coming to
Pittsburgh! Then Formation went on for about 10 minutes and the party was
shut down by the COPS AGAIN!!! FUCK me... I moved it to a private residence
and unfortunatly someone upstairs opened a window and the sound shot all
around the neighborhood and we got about 10 complaints from neighbors and such.
So All I can ask of you the Pittsburgh raver and the raver in general
Call Pittsburgh City HALL and ask why there can't be raves in Pittsburgh?
Because of a bunch of Bullshit

I'll put up the denial letter that they handed to me that day but I have to
go to bed now...

I had a great time @ ortho and hope to see you all at the Deadly Buda
tribute on the 19th of July!!!

sure ...

here's a review of Go Faster! ... it took place @ the irish center
in squirel hill, the sound was good, the lights where a'ight, the 
dj's where one, the MC must have been frustrated ... why? 'cause 
there was noone there ...

ever ask your self: what would happen if someone threw a rave and
no one came? well this was your answer ...

ok ... maybe i am stretchin the truth just a bit ;) ... but seriouly, 
the place was extremely empty. 

highlights: 
    +trace's set, it kicked ass 'specially the song with the 
        elctro sounding robot voice ...
    +playing catch with a lightstick on a string outside (till my friend
        threw it in the pool)
    +fishing the lightstick out of the pool ;)
    +playing with my airhorn 
    +playing with my whistle
    +runing around till i got tired (u can do that when it's not croweded and
        there is tons of space ;)
not-so-high lights:
    -lack of people
    -loseing my lightstick in the pool
    -the air horn running out of air at the exact time that the MC said
        "Comeone airhorn massiv ... " hehe ... what inproper timeing
    -did i mention that it was kinda empty inside? what happened?

peace

Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com

hey, 
   if anyone on this list produces techno (preferable hardcore),
you might want to check out this web site:

[http://domestic1.sjc.ox.ac.uk/~sscape]

they are having a "produce a choon/remix" project.
they will supply you with a few samples to use in a track,
and you may add up to 10 others.  then, when you complete your
track, they will put it up on their page....
if enuff people send in good mixes, they will see about getting it 
put on vinyl from their record label, and release it as an ep.
of course this is a big maybe...
also, whenever you see a track up on the page, you are free to 
take it, and remix it again!  and then put it back up to be further
remixed!!!!!  the result will be  a total mass of mixes of the same
tracks!!!!  this is no contest either...just a project for fun.
also, the people doing this prefer that your remix is kept relatively 
hardcore because it is a happy hardcore based project, but they
really encourage experimenting and creativity.
for complete information check out the site or email me.

i hope someone from the area partakes in this.

love,
ryu

In response to noah's suggestion that people start a rave club:

I don't know how it is @ other schools, but here @ Pitt, The Land O' 
Bureaucracy, yes you can borrow a space if you represent an official 
club.  That's how WPTS, the radio station, put on a lot of killer (and 
filler) indie/punk/etc shows.  It's also how friends of mine did free 
shows, basically to promote their band and sunshine/lollipops/rainbows 
and other happy things that can be had at a free outdoor show.  Other 
friends of mine put on a hip hop show that way.  Black fraternities and 
sororities do it and put on shows...

The downside is that you still have to be really careful.  Lots of time, 
use of the space is restricted so you have to be shut down and cleaned up 
by 11pm or such nonsense.  If a fight breaks out, you're finished.  Or, 
as happened to make the powers ban WPTS from ever doing a show again, you 
get kids who don't care knocking holes in walls, bringing in alcohol, or 
the peice-de-resistence...burning a teeny weeny 3X5 American flag @ a 
rancid show.

bureaucracy has a way of making things difficult for people it doesn't 
like.  I imagine it would be much easier @ a place like CMU---smaller, 
less bureaucratic (I think), a bit more reasonable.

It's a good idea, but i don't know how you'd work out kinks like getting 
a space until dawn, etc.

If you have a clear purpose, I say go for it.

love, almost a graduate

Alright so i guess i am in charge of setting up a time for the net meet.  Well
i was thinking around 9pm,  Wow does that sound.  Seem early enough not to
interfer with other things, but late enough that everyone should hopefully be
there.  I would like to do it somewhat early so we all know who we are before
hand.  Also i figure when things get going, it will be harder to get people
to break away from what they are doing.

So that is my suggestion, i'm going to get some sheets to put on my car or tent
with some spray paint on it.  I'm not very artistic so it won't look very cool
but will get the point across.

Ok if you don't see me then i'll be wearing some phat brown cordaroys with
either a white Kick (the softdrink) shirt or a white D.A.R.E. to keep cops of
drugs shirt on.  I have 35 pounds of blowpops so make sure you hunt me down and
take some please.

Anyways this is the tentitive plan as long as i can make it.  I begging my
parents to let me have one of their cars for the weekend,  I'm pretty confident
i'll be there,  i'll ride my old  big wheel if i have too  :)

anyways i'm off any questoins please e-mail me

Ok i've been getting a lot of questoins concerning finding the net meet spot.
I will be decorating two sheets with spray paint that i will either put on my
car or tent.  don't expect anything fancy but it will be noticable.

Second the net meet is at 9pm on both friday and saturday.  This way people
that can't make it on friday can still meet up with us on friday.  I know of
atleast a couple of people that will be coming on saturday.

Any other questoins send me e-mail.  I will not be able to get e-mail from
tuesday until thursday morning though.  but this should help out a lot.

Well if so, definitely try to hit on them at parties!  Are they cute at all?
Sheeyit, imagine having the cops pull up to your outlaw, and then the 
mayor's daughter goes like "Yo copper, back off or I'll have my dad fire 
yo' ass, beeyotch."  Heheheh that would rule.

setting up a smart bar, antares.  if you would like i'll make room next
to my set up for net ravers to bring lawn chairs, tent, big spray painted 
signs, or whatever to kind of make a home base for net ravers all weekend 
+ the net gatherings at 9:oo pm on fri. & sat. if it would be helpful.

i'm setting up on the racetrack which should be close to the sound system

tell me what you think

Ok thanks to the wonderful offer by Jenifer i think we will have the net meet
by her smart bar.  It should be a nice easy location to find.  This way also
incase my big wheel get's stolen and i can't make it the net meet, it will still
be able to go on  :)

I will still be making sometime of a banner for it though.  So look for that
too.

anyways i won't be around the rest of today through thursday morning probably
because we are having a surprise party for my mom's birthday, yes her's is the
day after mine  :)   Anyway i apologize for the inconvience this might cause
but she is my mom and she will always come first.

I would also like to say thanks to everyone that has been trying to help out.
I wish more could be done.  but we still control the most important thing that
will determine how good of a weekend we all have.  We control what the vibe
will be like, and i don't know about you all, but i am really excited about
this and i'm not going to let anything or anyone ruin this weekend for me.  I
am so excited to meet all of you and to shake my little booty off to some phat
dj's and live pa's

I love you all, and can't wait to get there


- Love, Peace, and Lollipops

hi all :)


if anyone on this list would be able to gimme a ride to family affair id
really appreciate it.. my ride fell thru.....heres my story:

im not necessarily looking to do the whole thing, 2days+nights... im cool
with leaving pgh on fri nite and returning anytime sat....i went last year
and if the past repeats itself, everyone will be there and party hard
on fri nite and then it drops off form there but who knows mayeb there are
special suprises in store on sat nite? all i know is last year it was
unbearably hot and miserable during the day saturday and ther was no
running water of any sort no showers or faucets or anything so it got nice
and hot and stnky during the day...so id suggest forgetting the whole
camping thing and just getting a hotel nearby :)

anyone interested...

if so please email me back but calling me and leaving a message on my
voicemail at work would be GREATLY APPRECIATED :) its listed below but here
it is again (412) 762-6738...please call and let me know whats up ....

if you cant gimme a ride but know anyone who may be able to, call.. or
email me but i wont be able to check my mail until fri so thatll cut things
a lil close if i end up leaving fri ntie after work...i will recompense you
with gas money, tolls, etc...

(just talked to brian from ups on the phone as i was writing this.. most of
the *big* headliners are going to be on saturday nite to prevent the party
from dying out early on fri nite like last year...also lots more water...
and HOT SHOWERS available this year...only downside.. JOEY BELTRAM will not
be able to attend....looks like sat nite mite be the jam, leaving sat
aftnoon getting there arounf 4pm or so inthe aftnoon and then going til sun
morning looks like a plan :)

so whos with me?


thanks in advance!

peace,
hossam

Precedence: bulk

IF your sick of hearing about ortho, too bad.I've not checked my mail for a
while. I'll give my review (The short version- I think ppl have summed up
most of my night musicla and socially)
I have however, some additions:
I don't know how Ortho managed to be at four locations and still maintained
its vibe:)
-first we go to Northside (oopss, should have called the infoline again,
for those like me who arrived too late)
-then we go to Brad and Jacky's crib (A=Oh that's who's house it was--OR--
B=Who the Fuck is that?)  in East Liberty.
[If you chose C.= I don't care, I stole some bomb clothes from their
closets--- That's some disrespect that pisses me off.]
Got thewre at 1:00 am, I was gonna play my keyboards at three, Found out
Rick redid the lineup and I was supposed to be playing with Bleep from 12
to 1. Oooopss. I figured that's okay I'll find someone to play with later.
Found this kid Dave from Kiski who spun stuff overtop and undrneath my live
set for about five minutes at 3:30 upstairs, we were just getting into
gear, and then D-cypol was the one that gave me the bad news about the
5-0--SHIT.
------------------------------(More about cops below)-----------------------
-third location was at phil's and eric's crib in squirrel hill. I didn't go
cause I had to stay until the cops lewft and the equipment was taken care
of. I actually heard eric d. had to kick some people out.
-the fourth and final location for me was at the infamous EatnPuke in
squirrel Hill...man was I hungry, we had practically the whole smoking
section.

Well that's my night in a nutshell. I have to say I love going to these
renegades.
I LOVE PITTBURGH RENEGADE PARTIES!!
AS for the cops, they make them a hassle, but you know what? They aren't
going to stop us. They can move us from the Northside to East Liberty to
Squirrel to wherevah and I won't give a fuck.
Some people won't
come to these because of the five-0. THOSE OF YOU MUST READ THIS::
 These are the rules when it comes to COPS (written with Dave Barry logic):
        Cops LOVE people that are threated by them. Don't be stupid and
submiss to their system. Some people think cops don't like kids with
attitude.
        Cops LOVE kids with an attitude because it pisses them off.

        Cops LOVE to get pissed off Because they have the power to do
something about being pissed off.That's why they are cops.
        Cops LOVE to bust RAVES because it is almost garunteed that
someone's gonna piss them off. In fact the chances are doubled when the
kids are ready to have an attitude and the cops are ready to be pissed off.
On top of that, the kids are expecting the cops to be pissed off and the
cops are expecting the kids to have an attitude.
        The only way to stop this perpetuating cycle is for us the ravers,
to be friendly with the cops. Work with them. Attitude is probable cause,
Friendliness never hurts the scene. They are just doing their job and are
looking to get pissed off. Don't be the catalyst in this unwanted reaction;
it's usually what gets us in trouble......

I must agree with that!!! TOTALLY WICKED!!!  The alien attack itself was
incredible! I went to see it on Tuesday, I had my bro buy tickets at 4 pm
for the 10pm showing, I drove to  the theater straight from work [after
12hrs of work], got in an saw HUGE ASS lines! hehehe... luckily we got in
to the biggest room [capacity 500 people], sat in the middle and was
totally blown away by the surround sound and visuals. The screen must have
been like 50 feet wide!!! I must say FILM RULES! and I want one of them
movie projectors!!!! so I can dump all our visuals to film and show them
on a 50 ft screen!!!!! YUYKS!!!!!!



People coming to Philly on July 13th for Techno Funk will be able to see
some great sampled video sequences from the movie ID4... btw it will be
out last performance.

Ok yesterday i rused around and got some name tags made.  They aren't anything
special, i didn't have access to a computer so it isn't a computer design and
my art work isn't anything to brag about.  They are in color though  :)

So anyways there isn't any names on them so you will have to put that on
yourself, i don't have markers though for you to put it on with.  The name tags
fit into a plastic holder that has a bobbie pin type thing on the back that
will pin onto your shirt or whatever else you want it to hook onto.

Ok, i got my mommie's car too so i will deffintily be there.  Well i have 70
new letters for the less than 48 hours i was gone so i need to get reading.
See ya all there.  Oh  you can get a name badge anytime before and up until the
net meet.  After that i plan on doing other things, like dancing and shit.  If
you can't get it before than,  i'll be around from time to time or leave them
with others that are around

Ok almost everything is set up, but we need someone to bring a folding table.
I don't have room for that.  We could also use a couple extension cords too.
If anyone can bring any of these please let me know.

By the way,  the weather looks just about perfect for the weekend, high in the
mid-80's and lows in the mid 60's no rain until sunday afternoon.

Well if anyone can help out please drop me a line

Oh one more thing does anyone know when we can get in the park for sure.  I
have heard anything from after the after-hour party to 4pm.  I really hope we
can get in before 4pm.

  contacting him is damn near impossible about now - he's way too
  busy.

* since u may not be able to get thru to riff raff due to the
  volume of calls cuz of the party. i will give u direx to riff
  raff here:

  from all points, head toward akron, ohio.
  77 south
  off @ rt 8 north
  off @ 1st exit (buchtel ave)
  left @ stop light
  left @ next stop light
  right on exchange
  riff raff is located a block and a half on the right.

* pre-sale tickets are still available @ the pre-party FAMILY
  GATHERING going on tonight in akron, ohio. info: 330.214.8837.
  directions to the pre-partys are as follows:

* most of the headliners will be on saturday night to keep the
  party on a consistent upward vibe.

* lots more water & HOT SHOWERS available this year. there will
  also be soft drinks & smart drinks @ the stands. bring your
  own toiletries. some people are staying overnight @ nearby 
  hotels.

* unfortunately as of now, Joey Beltram has backed out from his
  gig. no downer cuz if u've heard Joey spin before, his name is
  bigger than his skillz.

* if u have any other questions, u can contact me via e-mail or
  call: 216.932.4731 and i'll answer yur questions personally

* i'm thinking about putting together a "FAMILY ALBUM" of all
  the pictures i've taken from all the partys i've hit this
  past year. and if u know me that's quite a ton of pictures.
  if u find me during the party, i just might show it to yah.
  to find me just ask any tom, dick, or harry non newbie from
  ohio where stevie t is (most old skool ravahs know me in 
  these parts) and they should point u the right direction.
  i'll try & make the net meet @ 9pm by the smart bar on
  saturday night, but i think i might miss the one on friday
  (too early).

c-y'all there...

Uh, people keep forgetting a couple of things when they talk about the 
cops.  Primarily, EVEN RAVERS HAVE RIGHTS, KIDS!!!!!  You don't have to let 
the cops into you crib without a warrant.  I found it violently disgusting 
that people were just letting them pass through at Ortho part B in East 
Liberty.  also, if you're going to throw a renengade, it's good to KNOW 
the laws cold.  Like, are you allowed to have a party on public 
property?  Do you have to see proof of a noise complaint to shut down?  
etc...

And a good attitude (lack thereof) always helps.  I know people who have 
gotten the least agreeable people to do the most amazing things b/c 
they're just good that way.

argh.

Hey all I'm going to be @ Family Affair and I can't wait. I still have no

BTW I can bring a few extension cords for the net - zone. I'll be around
the whole place but I think the Pittsburghers are going to make a village
of sorts @ Bear Creek Campgrounds. I know that n'sync productions r
bringing turntables because I'm supplying the generator. I dunno though it
seems kinda cliquey to me but oh well it should be cool. I can't even begin
to list the #'s of people that are coming from Pittsburgh.
But I'm the tall one with the hair. :) So I guess I'll see ya'll there!!!
Tis' gonna be quite phat...

The Church (cleveland), Unity Groove (kentucky), & Park Rave Madness (NYC)
are offering us a safe way to travel [to Fantasia 2]. But we need your

F A N T A S I A   I I

in the beginning house was a feeling, and from this feeling came the music.
the music came together to create the atomosphere and then the summer of 
love.
but the people grew disillusioned and became divided. different forms of 
music
were created and a new generation of ravers were born. techno was the new
feeling. and from techno emerged music that incorporated sounds of a new era.
the music was more than just a feeling, it was a way of life. intelligent
music for intelligent minds. detrimental drums and bassline. music for the
future. so as the beats and the bass thunder down, we bring forth the knights
of the underground.

Golden Joy	Sat aug 3, 1996		Pittsburgh, pa
When we first got involved in this scene we were awed by many things.  
The most memorable was the sheer energy and excitement of going to a new 
space, hearing sick DJs and the feeling of a massive sound system moving 
your body.  These are the things that we kept in mind while panning this 
event.  We invite you to come and hear some of the best DJ talen in the 
US and groove to one of the most musically complete line-ups Pittsburgh 
has ever seen on one of the best sound systems ever brought here.  this 
party isn't for egos, names or glory... this party is for you to end your 
summer properly.  Peace.

Speaking of dearest Mr. Superstar himself, I spied him at the JP Licks Ice 
Cream shop on Newbury Street in Boston this evening.  Right as I was 
getting ready to pay for my vanilla malt, I saw this guy in front of me 
pick up his cone from the cashier... he had a Rising High records 
T-shirt, which got my attention.  Anyhow, he took the cone, turned around 
and said, "Here you go, Keoki..."  I spun around, and there he was, with 
a record in hand (note, one record), the pretentious sun-glasses, the 
leather pants, and the oh-so-GLAM haircut.  I just looked at him funny, 
but the kicker lied when he walked past me to the door, and I noticed 
that he had 'Keoki' tattooed on the back of his forehead.  Awwww, he 
remembered his name... :)  I had to smirk and chuckle, but I held back on 
the guffaw.

And that, my cybertribe friends, was my first "brush with greatness" 
(ahem, scratch that...) "brush with...a SUPERSTAR" o' 1996.


Oh, and if you want to feel the arm of my shirt that brushed against him, 
It'll be on display in my posh Brookline apartment from 3:00-3:22 on 
Sunday.  Right next to my autographed Barry Manilow 8-track.

ciao!

I'm not going to go on and on about this one. You'd think after all this
time I would have gone to an outdoor event/campout at least one time.
However this was my first and what an AMAZING experience it was. I went
with d.Cypol(Jason) and 1.8.7(Joe) and we couldn't stop saying to each
other how much fun we were having. It was great. The live acts Deep Dish
Boys / P-909 / Atomic Babies / were nutz. On Friday Gavin Hardkiss blew me
away. Then Feelgood created an orgiastic frenzy on the dancefloor after
Gavin. Most of the music was excellent. Especially d.Cypol(Wid 'da Happy
Hardcore) playing 3 sets at all 3 rooms. The best set however was around 5
or 6 when he went on on the main stage it was still about 95 degrees and
there were about 200 people there ripping up the dance floor dancing fast
to Happy hardcore, unreal.
Except for the tent next to me which was playing Short Dick Man, whatever.
The light show was good. The laser was cool. But the music was great. I
have one complain... no line-ups posted!!! I had no idea when any dj was
going on. I had to listen close to overhear who was going on I asked many
people, even on the main stage and every 1 out of 10 people knew. Plus I
missed many djs that I wanted to see:
I missed Robert Armani / Carlos / Kelly Hand(K.Hand) / Scorpion /
Hyperactive (DAMN!!!).
There are so many advantages to posting a line-up. People/promoters know
who's playing and the Djs can get more exposure. Plus if more people know
what dj is playing I'd bet he/she may get a better crowd.

Many Props to the UPS Crew.... I hope it went well for ya. I know I had a
good one.

COINCIDENTALLY...

I still need a ride to this event- from Boston to Pittsburgh.  I offer 
the kind driver my first born child.  (Oh, and gas money, housing, etc.)

I live there... but am here in Boston for the summer.  I MUST see Joel 
spin again-- it has been a while.  Let me add that Buda's music will grab 
you, slap you in the face, and command you to dance like a raving 
maniac.. (pardon the pun)... he SHOULD NOT BE MISSED...

...which is exactly why I need a ride!  :)

Email me at: hannibal@acs.bu.edu, or give me a call at 617.278.0235 if 
you want to check out this free event and the city o' three rivers!

holy shit!  i dont even remember the last time i had so much fun at a rave!!!
 I am so proud to be a clevelander right now!  no longer will i ever be
ashamed to tell someone that i am from cleveland!!  CLEVELAND ROCKS!!  hehe. 

i see no point in going off on some huge review of that party... i mean i
think its a safe assumption that everyone from cle/pgh was there :)  Hey - i
was wondering, does anyone have any idea how many people were actually there?
 I heard 6,000 - but i dont know if that was right or not.  Wow.  i am just
so happy that that was just such a wonderful party!  Whoever it was that said
they missed Carlos's set - i pity you!  He rocked my world!  :)  i couldn't
believe my ears saturday night.  I mean friday night was great.  On my
standards, fri night was like a really good party.  Saturday night was
phenominal though.  I haven't danced that much in SO LONG.  i started dancing
around 10 and just didn't stop until around 5 when my legs literally were
givin out on me.  

what a wonderful weekend!  it was wonderful to see so many people i wanted to
meet up with... it was wonderful to get to see so many great djs... the
lights were wonderful...  it all was just amazing!!!  The only thing i have
to say though - is who's great idea was it to put sand in front of the main
stage ?!?!  AND  who was the idiot who signed the contract for that location
agreeing that the music on the main stage would be kept at "LOW VOLUME" from
midnight until 8am.  When the sound guys told me that, my jaw just about hit
the floor.  I mean i knew there was somethin wrong when you could stand in
front of those huge speakers and still talk in a normal voice.  i dunno -
both nights there was definitely a volume problem. But you know what.  it
didn't really even matter - b/c that was just a phenominal weekend!!!!

mad props to anyone who had anything to do with making that weekend so great!

lots of luv
leah

The word corpoartion scares me, but I can't pass judgement on something i 
don't know anything about.  What is this?  What's the goal and the plan 
and the history and the future?

I only got there late saturday night, but it was really neat.  I have a 
sore throat from all that natural smog, but it's all good.  soluslinger 
ripped the place to shreds (or my ears, anyway.)  More volume would have 
been wonderful.  

It was really cool to observe such a big and representative slice of the 
rave scene.  I tried not to, but I couldn't help thinking of woodstock.  
there was a feeling of community,b ut it wasnt' paradise.  I think that's 
great.  A meeting of minds and feet, a big village of tents, very neat.  
Plus I love the country.

What did yall like best about the atmosphere?  I think I liked, not the 
sense of community, but the *reality* of community, good and bad.  So much 
common ground, 
but there were tiffs and the beginning of fights, good and bad drugs, 
happiness and unhappiness.  a very real slice of life.  An 
anthrolpologist would have cum just looking at it.

big up to ups and all the crusty, grassy ravers still recovering.  :)

Hey kids.

I have a bit of writing to share with you/push upon you.

I haven't created and *presented* anythign in a long time, but the past 
few days have brought out my egotism AND low self eteem, so I guess it's 
that time again.  I'm attention hungry but I don't write tracks...

I write, but i hate the poetry scene, so you's get to be my coffeehouse.  
I wrote this bit several months ago when I was in a very good mood and a 
little bit in love with a poet from rochester.  Rereading it, it 
reminded me a  little bit of the sweet, not the bitter, of Family 
Affair.  feedback would be cool.  Here goes:

April Showers/Sea of Tears
__________________________

Spring, and life uncurls like a morning glory, patient like an open 
window.  A mother, cool lap, washing away tearlessness, bathing away 
icicles with cool dark.  Love for the world vivid as wet, purple as my 
v-neck tee shirt.  Beautiful dances, Honest sings, Free breathes deep and 
wide, slow, swims, rolls, lies, is soft, is still, loves, opens, welcomes.

I could drink all the plurry people, I could breathe them, I could camp 
with them, play flutes and drums and smile as deep as crying without the 
need to.

The real people smell as deep as the woods when I'm Isobel, perfectly 
intuitively aware that I've spent 3 hours with the trees and none with 
the papers.

Busy as a Dickens street, the adjectives and objectives scurry by in 
suits and worried looks.  But to be dirty, to be cold, to feel how a 
shirt touches my stomach, how my foot flirts with my calf, I am enough.  
I, a glass.  I'm full.  I'm filled.  i'm real.  I'm ready to drink, hug, 
breathe the others.  They know what's real.  They also know what's good.  
They live at the corner of Good and Real.  Make a left at the campfire, a 
block past the big machines.  If you hit the Gates of Hell you've gone 
too far.

At the corner store they sell lollipops and brine too, Valentines and 
single beds and sleeping bags and bicycles made for 2 and 3, and buses.  

Things aren't black and white there, but not just sunny or dark, either.  
Things start at bright red, drip and fade through the spectrum, yeah, but 
also through old couches, matted canvasses, a model's copper earthy 
eyelid, to the bottom of my muddy feet, brown as Mexican children.  They 
hover and vibrate like heat around yellows and browns, drop to charcoal, 
spring to pink and chartruese and all the fluorescents, curve around and 
pick up sweet violet, burgundy thick with wisdom, grab some dust and wind 
back up to glistening purple.

You can get lost at Good and Real.  Or you can hold it in your hand and 
turn it like a stone.

If you're not the type to live here, you never want to anyway.  Visitors 
are welcome and come over a lot, but they don't stay too long at a time.

Ah, be they subgeniuses, christians, geminis and capricorns, ravers, 
thinkers, I don't care.  The good people know each other and they do live 
at the same corner.  They know that.

so much for the global community...steph

family affair 2 was lots of fun. i rode my bike there from here & it
took me 4 hrs. which wasn't bad for 40 mi., considering all the hills
+ i only got about 4 hrs. of sleep the nite before (it seems like
every time i need to get up early, there's a huge keg party at my
house the nite before it so i don't get to sleep until 5am & i try to
cover up the noise with ambient). 
the 1st nite of FA2 the music that i did hear wasn't very good, &
since i didn't know who was going on when so i missed robert armani. 
but i went to sleep early. the next day i got a sunburn/suntan, then 
danced a lot. it's really nice when u just feel like dancing at any
hr. of the day or nite + u can go up to where the stage is & there's 
already music. i wish real life was like that! dancing on sand was 
not fun though, u can't move your feet around enough, but i was 
lucky to get a lot of time on the cardboard.
i went down to that 2nd stage (or the "teepee with a discoball" as it
had been called before!) 1 time, & i heard planet rock by afrika
bambaataa as i was going so i ran there, i love that song. someone was
spinning this mix of old school hip-hop & funky acid breakbeat
definitely very good. does anybody know who that was?
soulslinger spun some pretty good music, but enough of the mcing! i
can't dance with it going on & i had wanted to dance to good jungle.  
carlos was good of course but i liked his set better at 420, that was 
funkier & more breaks, though his set kept me grooving. 
whoever went on right after carlos was terrible, why was he allowed to
spin at all? he put on a record & about 90% of the people dancing just
stopped + looked up there with looks on their faces that were like
"WHAT is this? this record sucks" every record was so monotonous
almost nothing changed through the whole track + each 1 felt like this
perpetual buildup. and the tweaking was totally off, & he kept cutting
the volume in the middle of a measure to hear whoever was talking to
him instead of just stepping over there. i say if you're going to do
stuff like tweaking & scratching practice in private until u don't
suck, THEN do it in a set.
who went on after him, was that pulserver? i liked his records,
although he had a few mistakes in mixing + stuff.
a while after that i went home but i couldn't ride my bike like i had
wanted & i could barely walk or pack my stuff anyway from way too much
special k (oops!) so i found a ride.
by the way if u don't know who i am yet & might have wondered i was
wearing this black & flourescent green checkered soccer goalie shirt 
on sat (& it glowed when the sun was setting & rising!...very trippy) 
+ was dancing on the stage from about 4 or 5 until whenever it ended.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
this is also another 1 of those messages about people to watch out
for. i know these things from personal experience (except where
noted):
person 1: pat (a guy), about 5'8", average wt. with muscles. with 
very short dark brown hair. has sideburns i think. has tattoos all
over his back. always looks stoned (+ probably always is). does & 
sells loads of drugs. wears big clothes, + stocking caps, usually a 
green & white striped 1. was wearing shorts + a white stocking cap at 
family affair 2. he used to be a roommate of mine a few month ago then
he went to a party + never came back & never told us where he was. his
rent & bills never got paid that time. right now i have heard he is 
travelling all over dealing drugs & going to parties all the time. 
he's stolen some things from our house & he took my dickies pants & 
adam x mixtape with him when he left. anyone is welcome to steal those
things from him! he owes 100s & 100s of $ to various people here in
kent + everybody from here has refused to talk to him. so don't loan
him any $ or give him a ride or let him stay with u, he will take your
stuff. to the best of my knowlege though he doesn't sell fake drugs
though.

person 2: lars. he is really thin, about 5'5", has light brown hair,
that's sometimes very short, has a goatee. 20 yrs old. round
glasses. big clothes as of now, he goes through all these phases, was
a wannabe prep, then a wannabe goth, then a wannabe graffiti artist,
then a wannabe cyberpunk i guess, now a wannabe raver/promoter, but 
has been going to parties for a while which is why people should watch
out. he is always homeless + seems to stay around here. he also does
loads of drugs (including really idiotic stuff like inhaling aerosol
shoe polish propellant (very bizarre) & taking pills he finds on the 
ground & has no idea what they are & smoking crack) he also has
grandiose plans to make $ dealing but does all the drugs himself + 
loses his $. he was staying at my house for a while (pat invited him)
& so many of my tapes & cds are now missing because he took them. he
takes your things without asking, then loses them. he is extremely
immature + extremely spoiled + has no common sense. before family
affair 2, he told me he was totally broke & couldn't go, then he shows
up there + tells me he worked & earned $60. it turned out he stole the
$ from work. almost nobody in kent will talk to him anymore either. he
has completely overstayed what little welcome he had here but doesn't
even realize it + think people like him. anyway, do not trusst him
either, he will also take your stuff.

sorry this post is so long...

this party kicked ass.
i had a sooperdooper good time. i was only able to go on saturday night,
and i still had to pay $25 (wasssup wit dat!) but i think it was definitely
worth my money.  my friend brant and i arrived at about nine o'clock on
saturday, and immediately as we drove in we were surronded by a cloud of
dirt..it was kinda like pigpen from peanuts ;) everywhere you walked, (or
drove) dirt kicked up behind you and around you...heheh dirty, but fun.

the space was at the same campgrounds as it was last year, and when we got
there it was still a little bit light out, so a lot of ppl were just
chillin with their stereos and campfires and around their tents...saw a
buncha ppl that i knew (which was really cool, i was afraid that there
would be so many ppl that i wouldnt be able to find my friends)

we went down to the mainstage which was at the same place that is was last
year. lets see if i can remember the djs :)

there was no lineup posted *anywhere*!! i cannot tell you how much that
sucks. i was even up on stage asking the other djs and ppl who was on, no
one knew anything. so for the first two or three hours, i have no idea who
i was listening to...*shrug* PROMOTERS: for future reference, the crowd
wants to know who is spinning :) good music for the first whole
part....even though i have no clue who it was...i think it was
goodwill...and then P909...i wasnt really dancing during this part...but
then again i could be confused...i have no clue. this is why i like lineups
:) so anyways, this is when they started havign difficulties with the
sound. the sound system was kinda screwy, i heard taht they had to turn it
down the first night, and they kept turnign it down throughout the night
saturday night too.

soulslinger had the main time slot, i think from 2-4 or something like
that. i danced a little bit, but got sidetracked on a trip to the car for
water, and also i was mainly just walkign around talkign to people and
meeting ppl..if a girl with dark hair gave you a buncha grapes, well that
was me :) i thought that was the funnest part of the party was giving my
grapes to ppl, it made them happy :)

soulslinger was good, played one of my favorite jungle tracks, and there
was an mc or something, and a buncha girls on the stage dancing, and i
think there was a big circle in the middle of the crowd..i am not so sure
about this whole time period...but it looked fun, the music was good (i
thought) and i was havin a blast even if i wasnt dancing that much.

someone might have gone on after soulslinger, i dont know..the next thing i
remember was kelly hand...she played some really good tracks, but i think
she was messing with the levels or soemthing (or maybe it was the sound
ppl, i dont know) the levels kept getting screwy, and going up and down,
and then the monitors were going out and  shit liek that..it must have been
very distressing for her, but the kids in the crowd just kept going, it was
pretty coool...by that time i had gotten rid of all of my grapes, and had
abandoned the left hand side of the stage and the left speakers for a much
better spot---behind the stage to the right and on the right hand side of
the stage because that is where you could get the good monitor sounds, and
you coudl also dance ON WOOD! instead of in a big cloud of sand...!!!!
woooohaaaaaaaaa!

well there had been a rumor going around that carlos wasnt going to show,
but he finally got there during kelly hand's set, and ended up spinning
after her at six (i think) .....by the middle of kelly's set hte sun was
beginnning to turn the dark night a shade of blue..it was absolutely
beautiful..i cant tell you how beautiful the whole night was..the stars in
the sky were just incredible, there was a huge hill behind the crow, and
kids were dancing and laying on the hill...a lot of the crowd thinned out
at about five ...not many ppl knew that carlos was going to spin (well no
one knew anythign about the lineup--including the promoters, i think).

carlos. damn that man blew me away. it was the first time i had heard him.
excellent set full of scratching..that man has energy!!!! so much fun to
dance to!!! the sun was comign up during his set, adn i was dancing on the
stage right to the east of the tables..i knew taht because right behind me
the sun was coming up, and i could see my shadow from the sun cast out
against the rest of the stage...absolutley beautiful set..i had teh best
time..if you saw me i was that crazy girl with the huge smile
dancedancedancing right there...there were a whole buncha kids still going
during carlos's set, adn he just kept us going with his energy...he was
shaking his hands in teh air, clapping, scratching, motioning out to the
sound guys to turn it the fuck UP! the only bad thing was that the monitors
kept going out for him..pretty frustrating i would think..but it was all
good...he was just cutting and scratching, and just totally ripping shit
up! yayayyayayayyayayayay!!!!!! i was in heaven.

allnight we were waiting to find out when kell was going on...and he was
supposed to go on after carlos or soemthing, but then perry ellis went
on...i  really liked his set as well!..he played alot of my favorite
records, and he played the basic channel(i think) record that i love!! (a
little fast for my taste, but its okay!!) his mixing wasnt quite that
tight....but i still thought he did a really good job..once again, i was
the girl on the east side of the stage dancing my ass off! :) and i was
still saving some for kell :)

unfortunately, kell got bumped *again* ! what the hell?!!! after perry
ellis some kid (i have no clue who) got on the tables and was playing some
good records, but his mixing wasnt quite that good...his records were
really fun house tho :) he was scratchin them up, and i would have
preferred to have just heard the records, but its all good...by this tiem i
had retired to the ground to dance.

the sound went off after the nameless dj boy, and they instructed us that
kell would be spinning at the second stage...alrighteeeee...i had left my
backpack next to a telephone poll all night, and it got moved and rummaged
through..good thing i found it (my fault for leaving it for so long :/ ) so
i went back to the car to get some stuff and to say goodbye to my friends,
kell's car pulled around and i yelled to him and asked him what was up, and
he said that he was spinning at the second sound system by the booths...so
i said some more goodbyes, and then remembered that i had left my (gill's)
stone roses t-shirt up on the mainstage, so i went to go get it..

we drove up there in our dusty car, i retrieved my tshirt. i saw carlos
wheeling his records to the car, and i told him how happy his set made me
and thanked him. he was the sweetest thing, he gave me a kiss on the cheek
and a big hug! what a sweet guy!!! --well there was no music going on by
the booths, and i didnt know where else the 'other' stage could be....so i
just figured that maybe i had missed kell..which sucks.

so, kell, i am sorry that i missed you--and UPS ppl, i think it sucks that
we didnt get to hear kell on the main system :P  other than that, this
dirty-ass party rocked my world, and i was so happy that i could be there!

right oh carlos was good, some of his tracks were way cheezy but his 
mixing was excellent and the last hour of his set was wikked. ok i have a 
track question now. does anyone know a new song that came out that has a 
really deep voice refraining "acid pump" over a minimal acid track?

um no u are way off on this one. Perry Ellis from cincy spun after carlos 
and had a really great set that bluit one track on to the next completely 
flowing. his last mix of gene farris' "summer affair" and onother rekkid 
i didn't recognize was amzing. then that jack ass that kicked him 
off played some wackass shit that he couldn't even mix. fuck pulserver or 
whatever his name is. him and his wackass sideburns better watch out next 
time. anyway to finish with reviewing perry's set... he isn;t the most 
known dj in this world but he rocked at Family Affair it was a shame that 
he could only spin for a half an hour because of that wackass. that guy 
was way out of line. oh and bye the way i hope everyone flames me to hell 
because i love deleting that crap. sorry if i am a little harash but this 
inccident pissed me off alot at the party, actually one of the only 
bummers of the party, so i thought i would get that off my chest.

> who went on after him, was that pulserver? i liked his records,
> although he had a few mistakes in mixing + stuff.

nope he blew ass through the speakers :)


sorry to post so negitivly which is something i don't wanna do but there 
is a certin unwritten code with time slots and that guy went way out of 
line. and then to even spin a terrible set takes such balls.  i dunno. 
nothing personal here from my end i just wanted to vent about something 
that has pissed me off a bit.

Allright kids,  I started a personal home page today.  Check it out at:

www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/3520

I'm teaching myself HTML, so the process is slow.  But I've got the 
basics laid out.  Let me know what you think.

Eventually, I'm going to make a rave database, a Lynch archive, and pages 
dedicated to all o' my favorite bands/discs..

peace.

Alright to start off, let me say that no, I am not out of mind and I would
appreciate not getting flamed for this message.....

I'm looking for any other Christian ravers out there (NO, I do not find
the two things mutually exclusive :) in the midwest....(Cinti would be a
plus, but hey I won't ask for too much) to talk to about being a Christian
and going to parties, etc......I'd love to talk to any of you that would
like to you know, ask me how in the hell I can be a Christian and go to
parties :) but I really don't want to hear immature Christian
bashing.....Anyway, if you're interested in talkin' drop me a line
privately!!

BTW: Is there neone passing through Cincy on their way to Transphere????

PLUR to all!!! :) :) *lots of warm fuzzies*

    Subject: Family Affair 2: The Reunion (it's from ME, of course it's long!)
    Date: Wed, 10 Jul

    
    
    Dear Cybertribe -
    
    So about midafternoon on Friday Ron and I commence preparations for our
    trip to Family Affair 2 in Canton, Ohio.  We picked up the car, got the
    camping equipment from Chris Dunn (THANKS CHRIS!) including a tent,
    sleeping bags and a cooler, made appropriate tape selections, went to the
    grocery store to fill the cooler and hit the road outta Baltimore at about
    6 pm.  Since we'd been up the night before and had only gotten about 3
    hours sleep, we took turns driving while the other one slept, and made it
    safely to the campground at about 3 am.  The nice folks who sold us our
    wristbands told us we'd just missed Robert Armani (ARGH!); later we found
    out we'd missed Feelgood and Gavin Hardkiss as well.  Drat.  =( We drove
    around the campground looking for a place to park the car and finally
    managed to find a spot, coincidentally right near Stickman and the 412
    Pittsburgh Crew (who had labeled their tent as such for easy
    identification).  =)  Since it was too dark to pitch the tent, we went to
    check out who was spinning, heard some really good "bleepy" Detroit techno
    and hung with Chris Green to listen to it for a while (I was too tired to
    dance).  (Have no idea who was at the decks, since, as has already been
    pointed out, the lineup was posted NOWHERE.)  Around 4:30 am or so we gave
    up and decided to sleep in the car, got up around 8 after the sun came up,
    pitched the tent, and went back to sleep til about 11.  =) 
    
    I didn't really know what to expect, since I'd never been to one of these
    multi-day camping raves before (one of the reasons I wanted to go to this
    one).  I thought the music might go on 24/7, but it was just at night,
    which was fine.  Saturday was a nice chill day; there was a lake to swim
    in (which made me very happy), we walked around talking to people - both
    NEravers we already knew, and folks we met there.  I must say, midwest
    ravers are quite friendly!  There was a nice diverse mix of people; 
    hippie/Deadhead types, candy ravers, older people (as in my age and up,
    heh heh) and regular-looking people.  NEravers we ran into over the course
    of the weekend included Eliz from Delaware, Chris Green, Hossam, Andy B
    (there with the Atomic Babies), Stickman, SarahS, Brian McCaffrey,
    Jwan/Jazzy, Adrian Hardesty and rainbow (unfortunately we didn't get to
    see hug).  I hear that Joe/1.8.7 was there, but once again, I managed not
    to meet him.  ;)  The couple parked next to Ron and me, Russ and Brenda,
    were from Michigan and as it turned out, live in my hometown of Livonia. 
    Tiny ass world!  =)  We borrowed their frisbee for a little while since
    I'd forgotten mine. ;)
    
    We left the campground for a little bit around dinner to go "downtown" 
    Canton for some grub, and got back in time to hang out a little bit before
    the net meet, which was at nine.  There, we met Stevie T (finally!  ;)  ),
    KC, Nevar and Jaguar from vrave, Jen/Antares who ran the smart bar,
    Nathan, Dave (who lives ONE MILE from my parents' house and went to the
    high school where my father was a guidance counselor, Tiny Ass World Part
    #2), Scott/Mint, Kell, and REALLY old school NERavers Prototype 909.  =) 
    We also met MW-Ravers Matt Joffe (from Michigan) and Robin Sparks (from
    Wisconsin) who became our er, EGG, buddies for the evening.  =)  The four
    of us went to the main stage area after the net meet and started dancing
    to the Atomic Babies - I don't know what you call their type of music but
    BOY was it good!  *I* have no idea.  Oh yeah, and was it just me or were
    the lights a lot better on Saturday than they were Friday?  Matt was not
    kidding when he said he'd brought 35 pounds of blowpops.  His backpack was
    full of them and there were more in the car. Oh, my god! =D We went back
    to our cars to get some things around midnight and lost Matt for a little
    bit because he was in "blowpop mode" - handing them out to every living
    thing around, I swear! =)
    
    The night after that is a happy blur.  Nice colored lights, dancing in the
    sand and trying to find solid ground, friendly people, the stars above
    (and sporadic fireworks), glowsticks lighting up the hills around the
    stage, blowpops and an amazing set by Prototype 909.  We left when
    Soulslinger came on (sorry, junglists) and went to just wander around the
    campsite in the dark - I think we also managed to miss the Deep Dish Boys
    (but that's okay since we can hear them every Friday at State of the Union
    in DC).  Around 6 am, Ron cocked his head and said "Do you hear that"? 
    The music had changed.  "Yeah..."  "That's Carlos - "  "Let's GO!"  We
    raced back up to the main stage area as the sun was rising to hear the
    Master of House Happiness once again.  The next two hours, I think, were
    probably among the best I've had since I started raving a year ago. 
    People who'd wandered off came back - Matthew and Robin, who we'd lost
    track of, SarahS, Brian, Andy B, Hossam, Adrian Hardesty, Jazzy, Kelliann
    from Delaware (who knows Monica) and Farquar from Dayton - everybody was
    dancing and although the sun was up, it was under clouds, so it wasn't hot
    at all.  I absolutely LOVE dancing at the end of a party.  Everyone who's
    there becomes your family for the duration and you don't need anything
    else in the world as long as your feet keep moving, the sky is light and
    the bass is pumping. I was running around and hugging people while I was
    dancing, and I haven't done THAT in quite a while.  (I'd like to thank
    Mint for the water - I kept bugging him for it and he eventually just gave
    it to me because I obviously needed it more than he did ;)  and Jazzy for
    keeping me company when I *did* need to take a short rest).  After Carlos
    was done, Perry Ellis (Cinci) and K.P. Sole (Soul?) from Buffalo spun nice
    dancy house sets I was impressed with (especially Ellis - he's one to
    watch) but everybody's energy level was waning.  People were starting to
    wander back to their tents, and those who'd gone to sleep earlier were
    starting to wake up.  What a strange border when night and day are mixed! 
    
    I think it was probably around 9 am when we finally decided it was time to
    go.  Since we weren't tired, we just packed up, said goodbye to Russ and
    Brenda (and Stickman, who saw us packing and came over) and headed out.
    More mixtapes.  More driving with the other one asleep.  The PA Turnpike
    and Maryland scenery.  And finally, Baltimore and REAL sleep.
    
    Thank you Underground Peace Society for such a slammin' party.  Thank you
    djs and performers and crew for giving it your all.  Thank you weather for
    cooperating.  Thank you NE and MW ravers and EVERYONE for showing up and
    bringing a wonderful vibe with you.  Thank you Stickman for being your own
    cool self, thank you Eliz for driving the vanload of people from Delaware,
    thank you Hossam for laughing all Sunday morning, thank you Andy B for
    picking me up and swinging me around, thank you SarahS for leading us
    through that dark-as-hell maze at the end.  =) 
    
    Thank you, Ron Koder/rlk, for being my traveling buddy and being the
    wonderful sweet person that you are.  ;) 
    
    
    I'm gonna scream it 'cause deep down I still believe it -
    
    
                   PEACE!      LOVE!     UNITY!      RESPECT!
    
    
    It's your world, people - take care of each other and yourselves - and
    KEEP ON DANCING!
    
    peace out,

a long time ago (late 1993) charles noel aka monochrome began the FUSION
series of tape compilations, under his own label and promotional concept
called the 21/22 corportation, which in turn is part of the ele_mental
concept.  the original intention of the FUSION series was to highlight
music made by people on the net, for people on the net, or whoever has
been paying attention...and has been done at charles' expense and NOT FOR 
PROFIT. 

basically anyone who bothered to send us a tape of their music got at
least one song on these comps, and most of it is GREAT stuff.  it's also
highlighted the development of the ele_mental musicians including todd
sines, charles noel, and titonton, among many others who are themselves in
various musical stages. 

now, 6 tapes and almost 3 years later, the series is ending.

we now present to you the last 2 chapters of the series, FUSIONs 5 & 6.
these are not mixtapes.  they are compilations of NEW MUSIC made by
netters and non-netters from columbus ohio, the mid-west, and beyond. 
this is your chance to hear and support new music, some by people you've
heard before, and some you've never heard before...but all the songs are
quality tracks that move the mind and body. 

and in case there's any doubt, we're doing these tapes for YOU and to
promote the ARTISTS involved, not for profit.  no money is made from these
tapes (in fact money is usually lost).  i hope that means something coming
from us... 

and thanks to those of you who _have_ been listening...we can't do any of
this without the people who have supported us with their time, energy,
money, and most of all, love. 

and we're not through yet...

I played with the Real one..


1. The "303" emulator is pretty cool ;)
2. IF you want Drum sounds dont Buy it..
3. It makes a great Sequencer ;)
4. ITs a Great First piece but if you already have stuff it aint all that..
better off investing a little more and geting better more specfic gear ;)

novation drumstation +bassstation= better ;) through in a Nord and you got a
combination better than sex ;)

Someone very reliable told me that 720 is cancelled. Can someone one
confirm this? What is going on that weekend anyway?
         I requested off to travel  to 720, yet I see no fliers and I hear
(I only hear, I don't know for a fact) that there is not enough money for
capital. I am confused about that. With all the people at 420 that loved it
and RAVED about it (excuse the pun) and told me it changed their life and
rocked their world, and the DJ lineup I saw on Trout's ROM looked pretty
hefty. All I'm saying is, wouldn't this be a good party to try to get
sponsored by someone? sm:)e com??
        When you do something right for the first time, and a lot of people
agree, you can't let something like money keep you from keepin it alive.
believe there's alot of money out there. Maybe I don't have and you don't
have it, you just have to look for it.
        So much for a motivational speech, I'm just trying to make myself
believe that maybe somehow, someway, I'll be able to have a great time July
20+21with the same vibe that everybody told me about at 420. (I am going to
TRIBUTE Jully 19th though, and perhaps you shall all come as well:)

peace

p.s. is this right?:

tickets: [for 720 taken from ROM for 7.4.96]

$20 @ door
$25 advance

I didn't think so.

My friend Jay is going to Lutheran Bible Institute in Seattle, and he's a
real hardcore raver.  He's actually the one that got me started in the
scene.  I'm sure someone in seattle isn't much help to you, but he is in
minneapolis for the summer.  Anyways, he's a very dedicated christian.
When I went out to seattle to hang out with him, we went raving with a
bunch of christian bible colllege students.  I myself am a baptised and
confirmed lutheran, although I'm not currently attending church services.
So, just to let you know, they ARE out there...

(actually, my full first name is christian, heh.)

 Yup, I would really like to check out the bassstation.  They're awfully 
pricey as well, eh?  It's not like I have enough flow to buy any of these 
fine pieces, I just would really like to play 'em...

Hey... I've got a Casio SK-5 sampler that I can unload.  It's such a 
brilliant little monophonic gem.  The lion roar will blow your socks off! 

I'm asking $100+... it's in prime condition.

=================================================================  
Someone very reliable told me that 720 is cancelled. Can someone one
confirm this? What is going on that weekend anyway?
         I requested off to travel  to 720, yet I see no fliers and I hear
(I only hear, I don't know for a fact) that there is not enough money for
capital. I am confused about that. With all the people at 420 that loved it
and RAVED about it (excuse the pun) and told me it changed their life and
rocked their world, and the DJ lineup I saw on Trout's ROM looked pretty
hefty. All I'm saying is, wouldn't this be a good party to try to get
sponsored by someone? sm:)e com??
================================================================== 

hmmm...aren't u the same guy that started that rumor that CHARM
wuz cancelled on the net 'bout a month ago? curious who are yur
wack sources?

talked w/ mr. cinch...the party IS STILL ON...flyers will go out
this weekend (i'll prolly be putting some out myself again)...they
were delayed cuz they were being done by this west coast graphic
company (by the same guy who did the graphics for that video game
Burncycle - should be a purdy dope flyah)...here's the details on
the voice mail (i'll post the final flyer later when i get it myself)...

	I could built one for less than that =)! Seriously though...this 
is a cool little 'toy' that is easily MIDI adaptable and can really 
generate that 'dirty' quality...the bongos aren't bad either!!

I'm a Christian DJ, and from Seattle (speciallizing in hard trance and
drum&bass); I'll be in the Minneapolis area between July 23 and 30....so If
you'd like to hook up something--or even just meet and talk--give me an email
ASAP.......I'd also love to go to/play any parties in the area on that
weekend (secular or not).....who is this other raver from Seattle?  I'd like
to get to know him....  ; )

Tim (Circle K)

i was brought up a christian as you can see from earlier posts i am not
any more, but i know the stuff. i am just curious, why would these things
be mutually exclusive at all? there is nothing in the bible about you cant
enjoy good music, is there? i would think you could be christian and enjoy
going to raves easily...

Hello Everyone...

I know this isn't rave related...SORRY.
But if anyone is a big game addict like myself and has been waiting for 
the release of one of the best 1st person games ever to come out...then
now is the time to download QUAKE Shareware 1.0.  Today, July 11, Quake 
shareware version 1.0 finally was downloaded from Id Software.  It is 
totally free to download now and you get the complete first episode to 
play until your heart's content.  I've playing Quake 0.91 for a few weeks 
now and it kicks butt.  You can download it either from Id Software's Web 
Page ( http://www.idsoftware.com ) or goto my homepage and click on the 
link to the Quake Download Web Page!

Thank You for your time!

P.L.U.R. Forever to All,
<Peace Love Unity & Respect>

Chuckie

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

Golden Joy	Sat aug 3, 1996		Pittsburgh, pa
When we first got involved in this scene we were awed by many things.  
The most memorable was the sheer energy and excitement of going to a new 
space, hearing sick DJs and the feeling of a massive sound system moving 
your body.  These are the things that we kept in mind while panning this 
event.  We invite you to come and hear some of the best DJ talen in the 
US and groove to one of the most musically complete line-ups Pittsburgh 
has ever seen on one of the best sound systems ever brought here.  this 
party isn't for egos, names or glory... this party is for you to end your 
summer properly.  Peace.

Hey everyone!!!

I'm trying to put a book out on Ecstasy. It will contain mostly 
experiences and public comments on the drug. I want to collect letters 
from people, in which they describe their trips (the best one or many) 
to E-Land. Then organize it into good and bad (hopefully none) 
experiences. Sharing this information with each other will be very 
valuable. We can understand it much better, and avoid potential dangers 
of the drug. 

This letter is in no way promoting the use of drug. But it does suggest 
a further education on it. Great information can be found at

http://www.hyperreal.com/drugs/

Specifically the book by Nicholas Saunders - E for Ecstasy 

http://www.hyperreal.com/drugs/e4x/

which is organized in an HTML format and is also available in plain text 
file which will print out to over 80 pages! Plus there is like 160 pages 
of annotations.

Anyway, please E-Mail me your experiences on Ecstasy, or other drugs for 
comparisment. LSD trips are usually very unique. Anything you have. Put 
it together in a 'story' form, and it will be included in this book, 
which will be available on Hyperreal upon completion. Your name can be 
referenced upon request. And you'll receive your own copy. 

I think that anyone would like to read it !!!


Thanks,
Mike the Phreak


P.S. Sorry for the massive mailing.

Hey all,

	I found out about this last night, and the line-up may or may not 
be complete, call the UDG info-line for more accurate info :-)

Anyways, this Tuesday there is another Steel City Jungle touching down at 
168 with the sounds of:

Upstairs:
1.8.7.
dieselBoy
Sine
Farmer Tea

Downstairs:
Ruffian
Johnny Blista
Smoove

And that's all I can remember from my phone conversation with John,
there's prolly more DJs than that on the bill... You'll note that this is
a change from before in that both floors will be open with DJ's, and also
the show will go until 4am this time, not just 2am as in the past. 

Hope to see y'all there...
                                           Tea

few more things...

	o	the correct ticket price is $25 in advance, $28 at the door
		(this is for a 3 day party with full camping facilities
		included)...

	o	tickets can be purchased on a day by day basis (like if u
		only want to go on saturday, you dont have to pay $28).
		
	o	THIS PARTY IS GOING ON 100%!! i just got off the phone with
		steve cinch (sleepy-c) from psychoactive, and he told me
		that all the dj's deposits have been paid, the space is
		solid, etc...so even tho the party is a week away, don't
		worry about whether or not the date will be moved back.

	o	finally, one note about dj swamp: he was this year's national
		winner of the dmc dj competition. :)


any questions email me + i'll see you in ohio!

peace,
hossam

overload, udg hopes you will find ak1200 to be an acceptable replacement.

hossam

party along with several other special surpise guests roaming around the
venue on cordless mikes :)

CHARM was a confusing little fiasco because there was a CHARM in Ohio the
same weekend
as CHARM by adk productions in pittsburgh. Everyone thought I was talking
about the one in Ohio when I really wasn't. The one in Pittsburgh was a
house party and I was at their house 'bout three dayz B4, telling me and my
friends they didn't wan't to do it......
        As for 720, I heard this directly from the mouth of Stickman. Any
complaints can go directly to his ass::   DWGV07C@prodigy.com (RICK K
WORTH)
        Sorry if I have confused anybody, but I know I'm not the only one
that was worried about 720.

Wow-- this whole situation is really depressing.  I just know that the 
next time I talk to my mom on the phone she's going to bring this 
incident up.  I mean, I've been going to parties for four years now, and 
my parents STILL aren't gung-ho about the entire idea.  Of course, there 
is nothing that they can do about it now-- I am a responsible adult, know 
my limits, and know the dangers out there.  All I know is that this story 
is BIG, and was on the news up here in Boston-- probably even CNN for all 
I know.  

Promoters out there should really be on their tiptoes right now.  This is 
a serious call for action.  For instance, if this poor girl HADN'T 
returned from the party okay, her big-wig father (who was a leader in the 
financial industry, so the news said) could have easily sued Park Rave 
(and won) for liability.  It is up to security to enforce the various 
laws that they lay down, including drugs and controlling who IS and is 
NOT allowed inside the party.  I don't have the posted lineup for 
Fantasia II, but if my memory serves me, I'm quite sure that the flyer 
stated that the party was 18+.  A few years back, an all ages party was 
nothing big-- kids were able to party in a fairly safe environment, with 
less drugs, attitude and other BS, but now our quote 'underground' 
unquote is the leading story on the local news.  Someone posted a few 
messages back that this is VERY unsettling and depressing, and I 
wholeheartedly agree.  I have friends that have known me ever since I've 
gone to parties (some that go with me, and others that have stopped going 
for various reasons...)  A lot of them ask me why I still go, with all of 
the bullshit out there, and I say that I guess I still have hope for the 
scene.  But almost every time I go out, I look around and see little kids 
asking me for E, guys (and girls) smoking dust in the men's room when I'm 
trying to cool down, etc.... it's just really saddening.  I can't help 
but wonder what some of their family backgrounds are, although I realize 
it's not nice  to judge people.  But how can I give some of these people 
any respect, when half of them disrespect themselves, the scene, their 
parents and me?  

You can say that natural selection may oust these people from the scene, 
but I'm telling all of you right now that this will never be the case.  
Decadence at parties is increasing by two-fold.  The authorities are 
beginning to become quite aware with what is going on.  If something does 
not change, our scene will no doubt be exterminated within the next few 
years if promoters and kids don't get their acts together.. The cops 
really should'nt have to deal with *any* of this... it's up to us to make 
the change.  Twisting the truth won't solve anything either.

	Amen.  I am too so sick of how raves are seemingly more as  decadent 
drug fiestas, than as just aplace to go listen to suphat muzik and have 
fun and just let go and release any frustrations//.  I am definitly not one 
to be completely anti drug... but 
sometimes i get so frustrated and sick of seeing these 15-17 yr old kidz 
doing more drugs than elvis in his whole life time... it sucks cause i 
know i did that too.. and i wish i cud say that it was just recently.. 
but i went thru it all like 2 1/2 yrs ago... ive been a raving for 3 or 
so yrs now.. and raves basically brought me onto trying drugs.. i started 
going b/c of the muzik.. but later felt like experimenting.. which did 
turn into a mild addiction.. 

well i guess all i am saying is that i 
honestly dont think raves have changed too much (but maybe in boston i 
dont know.. i know not in ny) i think back then we were just new to the 
whole rave scene.. and still kinda naive and kinda lost asto what was 
going on.. that happens when u are new to something.. and u just usually 
look at things in an innocent and simple way.. but as time goes on.. u 
learn more and more about the politics etc.. which changes yer perception 
on things..

	Well like u said.. our scene will get exterminated.. well the 
scene as we know it will.. but isnt that a good thing? well i believe 
that all good things come to an end.. but better and brighter things 
always come out of it.. i think the scene will just evolve.. just like 
everything else.. but u are rigth.. in order for it to evolve into a 
postive thing.. we will have to work at keeping the riff raff out ... i 
think kenya and i tried to say this like a year ago.. and got flamed left 
and right.. only cause we dissed e.. (one reason i dropped the e from 
pepper e :P~  btw it is my middle initial :P~) 

Maybe promotors shud start actuallypreaching to the kidz to learn to dance
instead of doing drugs or sumthin.. oh wait.. but promotors wudnt make
extra money off of kids high on muzik now wud they?

First we'd like to apologize for the massive cross post but if anyone 
wants to exchange information in the future let us know and we can mail 
only those individuals (as to prevent posting to all the lists like this)

We're still compiling information like crazy but the following is a list 
of events that we do not have ticket/admission prices for.  If you know 
any of the following please mail us privately (at ravedata@partnercomm.com). 
Thanks everyone!

This was a typical Detroit party, in same run-down warehouse, and phat as
hell. There was one DJ I didn't get into so much, the rest were
incredible. My favorite part, after 6, when it was supposed to end, until
I left at 6:30, the two last DJs started fucking around, pulling all sorts
of tricks and just generally having a great time. They fucked up as often
as they pulled it off, but the crowd was screaming and jumping all over
every time they did anything. Pretty soon the DJs were screaming and
jumping all over along with the 10 or so people left. I was having such a
blast, I hated to leave but my friends were sleeping in the corner and I
didn't know if I'd be able to stay awake to drive.
If anyone knows what the DJ schedule was, I'd like to know, especially who
those last 2 guys were.

<some crazy shpeel 'bout Tribute being the same night as IO3>

================================================================= 

what r u talking about jeff? Tribute is on July 19th, this friday.
IO3 isn't 'til next month i believe.

btw jeff, where were u for the net meet @ FA2? i know u were @ the 
party, cuz it wuz yur loud ass that woke us up saturday morning
talking to the kids in the tent beside us. u missed the biggest net
meet i ever attended. twenty some kids from the mw-rave, pb-cle-rave,
and ne-rave list. yay's for the netters i saw there: JJ, kell, jen,
chris green, sarahS, karen the info goddess, hossam, kc, marc, aron,
etc. etc. nays for the netters who i saw @ the party, but missed the
meet: jeff, kate, allroy (after i hooked u up w/ the guest list),
leah (atleast u finally got to meet hossam), stickman (u wuz prolly
too busy spreadin wack rumors 'bout 720), joe 187, udg john (who 
walked into our tent at an odd time w/ those darn Jungle Warfare 2
flyers), the rest u know who u are!

oh yah i'm happy to say brian, lee, & the entire UPS crew more than
broke even this time (as opposed to losing all that money last year).
attendance wuz well over 3000 the 1st night alone. needless to say
brian & lee are currently on a much deserved vacation.

> COMMODORE hard acid techno

Sounds good - haven't been many hard acid Dj's in pgh, well, that I'v 
heard, of late.  Where's COMMODORE from - out of town or just a n.k.o.t.b?

Shoot - I'm not sure if anyone posted the lineup yet, but Tomarrow's 
Steel City at 168 sounds killer.  Dieselboy, Sine, Farmer Tea, Ike and a 
187 PA! :)  Plus Smoov, Ruffian (spinning acid house) and I believe Bob 
downstairs.  And its running till 4...  with that line-up I don't know 
were they're gonna put all the peeple, but I'll be one of em crammed in 
there...:P

have phun,

speakin o which, the kewl thing to do thursday nights for TURNED

jacked up price of $4 for one out of town dj (when u can go to fremont
& hear 5 good dj's for $3 or columbus for an ele mental party and
hear 4 good dj's and one excellent live act for $2 or less or youngstown
and hear some good dj's for $3 or pittsburgh for a free JIVE TURKEYS
event. hell even spawntaneous just threw a free day party the sunday
after FA2). it has become abundantly clear that mr. curtain has become
GREEDY and all the true cleveland ravahs know it. plus u knew the shit
wuz wack when they would make all the dj's spin house :P bluh! titonton
& mike filly spinning HOUSE?! what a waste! just say no to paying four
bones to dance in a musty ole basement! hell, even BUMP @ locchio's

hey kids....

some news about 7:20 (just thought id share in case any of you were
planning on making the trek out and camping and stuff)



the party originally was supposed to be held at a campground in northeast
ohio...

it is now going to be at the cleveland agora, which is a theater and is
used for concerts and bands as well.


it is a 3 nite party still, the only thing is that there wont be nice
campsites to chill at during the days.. and i dont knwo if theyd allow ppl
to sit in their cars in the parking lot either...

so you can still go its just a question of finding somewhere to
stay/something to do during the days...

personally im going to the free party in pgh on fri nite with dj's deadly
buda (making his first return appearance in pgh in over 2 years), jordan
vesteyo from new york, and the one and only dj TIMESTRETCH coming in all
the way from boston to spin his exclusive selections recently obtained on
his last trip home to the uk....respect :)

then sat day chillin here in the burgh and goign up to cleveland on sat
evening (early maybe) hangin out with some friends then hitting the party
sat nite and returning on sunday....


just wanted to let you all know the score beforehand.



email me if you wanna meet up either in pgh or in cleveland and also if you
need crash space i can arrange for places to stay...


peace,
hossam

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

Golden Joy	Sat aug 3, 1996		Pittsburgh, pa
When we first got involved in this scene we were awed by many things.  
The most memorable was the sheer energy and excitement of going to a new 
space, hearing sick DJs and the feeling of a massive sound system moving 
your body.  These are the things that we kept in mind while panning this 
event.  We invite you to come and hear some of the best DJ talen in the 
US and groove to one of the most musically complete line-ups Pittsburgh 
has ever seen on one of the best sound systems ever brought here.  this 
party isn't for egos, names or glory... this party is for you to end your 
summer properly.  Peace.

The title says it all...

As of late i have been growing concerned about the general happiness at
parties...it seems now that everyone is shady. Or maybe I was damn
stupid before.

I mean, just last night at Steel city Jungle a fight between my friends
and a certain Numbered Dj started behind....Dancing???
Not to mention hearing several reports of this person being jealous of
that one....I left pittsburgh my hometown briefly to visit New York.
Those guys know how to throw a party! No shadiness....and eveyone
welcomed me with open arms....(of course some welcomed me a little more
than they should have!)only problem up there is the magnitude of
drugs....I dunno people...can someone shed some light on why pittsburgh
is growing shady??

hello

> I mean, just last night at Steel city Jungle a fight between my friends
> and a certain Numbered Dj started behind....Dancing???

	i was standing on the stage when all of that nonsense went down.
	from what i could tell, joe187 was toasting over sine's set.
	a breakdancing circle started on the dancefloor.  since the 168
	dancespace isn't exactly huge, joe asked that the breakers make
	some room for everyone else.  at that point one of the breakers
	(alex grey) goes over to joe and grabs the mic and begins a heated
	argument with him.  he then started a 'tug of war' with joe over
	the mic.  at that point some people stepped in and broke it up.
	joe went downstairs with one of the breakers (ian?) and apparently
	talked about some stuff.  he returned about 10 minutes later and
	everything was normal.

	i am down with breaking 100% (i used to break back in '86)...but
	if you think you can just roll up on stage and grab the mic out 
	of someone's hands that is being *paid* to be an event, you are
	out of line.  that is fucking bullshit.  alex had no right even
	being on stage, let alone pulling that stunt.  joe, sorry you
	had to deal with that.

> can someone shed some light on why pittsburgh is growing shady??

	there have been shady mugs in the scene here since day one.  this
	is nothing new.  joe187 is very far from being shady...i personally
	vouch for him.  every scene has its share of shady people doing
	shady things.  best you can do is hang with your friends and ignore
	that bullshit.

I was sitting next to diesel when that little scuffle occured, and as D
said, it wasn't that big of a deal.  Some people like to break, and
sometimes they get carried away and cover a lot of the dance floor.  I
also talked to Ian, (the breaker in question) and he was apologetic for
having caused a disturbance.  Ian is a good guy and was just trying to
throw down like everyone else, his windmills just get a little large :-)
Anyways, that was only a quick little tivvy and everything is o.k. now. 
No hard feeling between anyone from what I can see.  Joe was in the right
to speak up for dancers who deserve as much space as breakers ... I don't
know how Alex got involved, grabbing for the mic and all, but the rest of
the night went along nicely and I saw Ian back up on the floor around 3am,
observing instead of dancing, but at least he came back upstairs. 

I wish there was a way to accomodize all of the dancers 'cause I really 
like to see the b-boys throw down, but space is such a limiting factor at 
1.6.8. that I'm afraid breaks circles work best on Friday nights.

Yeah, it was a shame that Joe had to get involved, with people getting in
his face and all, but I think he handled things well and I'm glad that a
veteran like Joe was able to get involved early, keep a cool head, and
chill things out before shit could escalate.  My opinion on the whole
thing is that a brief five minute diversion like that is no reason to go
about prophesying the "death of the Pittsburgh scene" and such, calling
people shady, et cetera.  I'm sure it's all forgotten by now and Steel
City Jungle will be back in effect in a coupla weeks. 

One more thing, way to go Sine! ... Jumpin from behind the 
decks, headphones still on, vinyl still spinning, holding Joe and Alex at 
bay to keep the peace, and right back onto the decks for a smooth 
transition into the next track!  A new meaning to mixing skills :-)

Oh well...i guess i shoulda title the post, 'the modification of 'the scene''


while i really don't think raves and stuff will end, i do think it is
becoming darker.... it's just not as happy as it once was. i still
remember the first time i went to a rave.. people actually spoke to me!
and,no one was satndin' around lookin' all hard and stuff...you
know...it wasn't quite club Kong's like I was used to....hell I thought
it was amazing how everyone danced...

but ah that was a thing of the past...oh well...ferget it...

hossam sed:
=================================================================
the party originally was supposed to be held at a campground in northeast
ohio...

it is now going to be at the cleveland agora, which is a theater and is
used for concerts and bands as well.
=================================================================  

pre-sale tix will only be available @ the agora theatre.
pre-sale tix are $25 for all three days. or individually:
$15 for friday night
$20 for saturday night
$10 for sunday      

the cleveland agora is located @ 5000 euclid ave.               
phone: 216.881.6700.

==================================================================  
it is a 3 nite party still, the only thing is that there wont be nice
campsites to chill at during the days.. and i dont knwo if theyd allow ppl
to sit in their cars in the parking lot either...

so you can still go its just a question of finding somewhere to
stay/something to do during the days...
===================================================================

if u need a place to crash. i have some space @ my pad. not a
whole lot, but enuff for a few traveling ravahs. e me or leave
a message on my v-mail # below if u need a place to crash. i
live about ten minutes from the site.

====================================================================
personally im going to the free party in pgh on fri nite with dj's deadly
buda (making his first return appearance in pgh in over 2 years), jordan
vesteyo from new york, and the one and only dj TIMESTRETCH coming in all
the way from boston to spin his exclusive selections recently obtained on
his last trip home to the uk....respect :)
==================================================================== 

i'll be going to TRIBUTE too (prolly w/ some extra 720 flyahs) - 1st
time back in the 'burgh since Tunnelvision...hope i don't get beat up ;)
...hi joe 187...i just got in a fight w/ my roommate...nice big bruises
on my head...i'm a lover not a fighter...hey stickman rick wanna be my
bodyguard?   

speakin o which i think i might be hitting DEFORMED tonight in youngstown
to check out fellow netters: jeff/stuff and frank/count zero on the
wheels of steel & to drop off some 720 flyahs...hey any of u guys have 
direx?     

oh yah if yur wondering why u haven't seen the 720 flyers yet it's cuz
not only were they late...blame that on chris...but becuz this weekend
is cleveland's anniversary!...so this party is primarily a celebration
for clevelanders...we were selfish bastahds & didn't invite much of
anyone else ;)...plus i don't think the agora can hold quite as many 
people as for 420 (over 4000 hardcore ravahs)!

        ok, me and some freinds are trying to throw a netraver only party
        for txraves...kinda like mosaic...but ours is going to be
        outdoors...anyways the plannin for this has got me thinking that i
        want to once again try to throw some low cost parties...so i need
        your help...

        i would love to hear from all promoters, ESP PROMOTERS OF RENEGADE
        EVENTS!!!

        my main questions are...

        1. for outdoor parties, what is the best way to NOT get busted?
        the best types of land, best way to deal with coppahs, etc.

        2. for indoor parties, what is the best way to find a damn
        location?  i cant seem to get anyone to rent me a space for only a
        night or a weekend?  how do you get around that?

        3. to map point or not to map point?

        4. what is the best way to get a collective effort to work?
        without ppl feeling left out etc?  how were all the
        ideas/suggestions for mosaic managed?

        5. how should donations be handled before and after the party?


        those are my main questions but any and ALL
        help/suggestions/ideas/lessons learned would be soo great to
        hear...

No, Curt, I see what you're saying.  I tend to be shy and anti-social and 
kind of in my own world, but even I think the atmosphere is a little 
different.  Maybe it's the space, maybe it's the mood of the music (lots 
of the d'n'b lately has been spooky and stuff), maybe more people need 
to go and fill up the spot, maybe it's the "jungle 
attitude" or something.  Or, maybe it's just me.  But I do think I've 
noticed, like, competition, specifically among some of the girl junglists, 
like who can throw down the fastest and slickest, who has the cutest 
midriff, etc.  

This is definitely not true of everyone, and I'd like to applaud Joe 187, 
farmer Tea, Sine, etc, for being some of the most down-to-earth people in 
the city, let alone the scene.  Btw, Curt, I also applaud you for not 
getting bitter even tho it was you and some of your friends who were 
asked to hold back.  It would be easy to resent what happened, but 
instead you're looking for the cause and a solution.  That's sweet.  ;) 

But, yeah, I do kinda see a difference.  Part of the recent problems 
could be that the scene needs to grow.  There need to be new faces to 
refresh the spirit and more people to go around so we can have lots of 
people at ALL the parties.  Just a theory.

Hmm.  Maybe it's time to come out of my shell and start hugging people 
spontaneously.  Maybe it's time to start calling myself a raver, (oh no, 
a LABEL!!! <gasp>) at least when I'm raving, so I don't feel so damn 
anti-social!  :)  

Whatever, my brain is fried from too many foreign languages so I'm going 
to shut down my tower of babble.

Besos y abrazos, mis amigos.
Que les vayan bien y rave on como muhfuh's.

--========================_23317532==_
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

In light of some heavy media and law enforcement attention on the rave
scene, bunch of us on So-Cal Raves realized that it was time we centralize
and begin educating ourselves.

The end result (to this point) is a first draft of a handbook for
responsible raving that we are giving out at local events.  The 16 page
booklet is called "How Much Do You Love Raving?"

The basic angle of it is that our own selfishness, carelessness and
ignorance is keeping our movement from positive growth.  It outlines ways
to combat these obstacles and encourages people to begin communicating
about the importance of individual efforts in responsible raving.

Enclosed is a text-only version of this first draft.  I encouage each of
you to read it and learn from the mistakes we've made in Southern
California.  I also hope that you will in turn print out your own versions
of the information and pass it out to ravers in your communities.

It's time to innovate a more perfect future.

Please e-mail me if you have any questions or comments.


Thanks for your time,

Kc-of-DUNE

how much do you love raving?


a handbook for responsible raving


<page 1 BLANK>


<page 2>
The Goodvibe Starts from Within

Stop complaining
about everyone else.  What about yourself?
Are you treating others
the way you want to be treated?
That is the only route toward the
positivity that will unite us all.
Don't be afraid!
Fear is the source of all our conflicts and
aggressions.
The next time someone gives you a hard look,
understand that they are still captive
to their fears like you once were.
Don't resort to a negative response because that
will only create more  negativity.
Smile! Let the goodwill within you flow!
Maybe your strength and love will give them
the courage to open themselves,
and they will follow the new direction.
It is all up to you...
						-tito



<page 3>
This booklet is not intended to be definitive in its' approach...
it is a starting point for communication about very important
issues that directly affect each of us.

Our hope is that it will encourage you to step away
from the music with some friends for a moment so
that you can discuss the importance of individual
efforts in responsible raving.




Yeah?  So what's the problem?

It is becoming more and more difficult to continue our cultural
phenomenon known as the "Rave Movement." The reason
that raving is more difficult is because raves and even smaller
parties are being shut down by the police and other authorities
at an alarming rate.  Apart from DJs, sound and lights, in
order to throw a successful event you need secure locations,
permits/permission and insurance.  With any of these
ingredients missing there is a strong chance that the event will
not get off the ground.

In order to get these ingredients we must go to people outside
of the rave community... the public.


<page 4>
It is the public that formulates opinions about us as ravers.
Most times it is public opinion that keeps a landowner from
granting us on his property... that keeps an insurance
company from providing a necessary policy... that keeps civil
agencies from issuing a permit that makes an event legal and
"unbustable."

The police are not shutting us down because of a giant
conspiracy against ravers, raving and living life to its'
fullest...

They are shutting us down because of our own...

selfishness
carelessness
&
ignorance

If we rid ourselves of these anchors, our public image will
greatly improve and our fragile movement will surely
flourish.

How?  What can you do?  A lot!

YOU can make or break our movement!

<page 5>
It is incredibly easy to combat selfishness,
carelessness and ignorance and still have the time
of your life... maybe even have a better time than you've
ever experienced.  Imagine having the best time you've ever
had at a rave... now couple that with the feeling of
satisfaction and accomplishment that you would get from
helping build up and progress our scene... knowing that you
did your part.


*SELFISHNESS IS OVERCOME
BY RESPECT*

Each rave event is not yours alone... it is a communal
experience made for everyone.  It is the togetherness of
everyone that makes raves fun and fulfilling.  To completely
kill a group experience it only takes a few individuals who
don't understand the concept of community.  Here are some
examples of selfish acts.  Each is  followed by a way to
overcome the selfishness.

-RESPECTING  THE PUBLICS'' OPINION OF RAVERS-
Visibility of drugs and alcohol-
Drugs are taboo to most of the public that forms an opinion about us... the
same public that gives us permission to
gather and rave.  If you feel that you need to have your mood
elevated, please be discrete.  Don't let anyone see the presence of drugs.
Don't give them a reason to accuse us.  Nitrous
balloons are the biggest problem in this area.  Balloons can easily be seen
from a great distance and the hiss of the valves
makes it very easy to find the tanks.  PLEASE DON'T BRING BALLOONS OR
NITROUS TANKS INTO RAVES!   Similarly marijuana can easily be smelled.  It
is more difficult to find but don't make it obvious.

<page 6>
Being rude or obnoxious to non-ravers-
Rude and obnoxious behavior does nothing but upset people,
sometimes to the point of having them call the police.  Please
be polite to any "outsider" that you encounter while on the
way to or away from a rave.  Be polite to everyone for that
matter!

Noise-
Noise is a very big problem in most residential areas and is
often the reason for shut-downs.  Please be as quiet as
possible going to site.  Playing car radios loud, horn
honking, screeching tires and yelling can be louder than the
sound system enclosed in the venue.  Loitering around in the
parking area is illegal and only draws unwanted attention to
the party.  As you're walking to the door remember that you
are only moments away from being able to make as much
noise as you want!!

Fireworks-
Although cool to see, fireworks are a reason for instant shut-
downs. We all know about the danger of fires.  Enough said.
Additionally, the loud explosions can be misconstrued as
gun-shots which will get the police to the location faster than
anything.

Guns and Violence-
Neither of these belong at a rave.  It is our non-violent nature
that sets us apart... makes us better than than the rock and rap
scenes.  Hopefully, a positive rave experience will change the
life of a violent natured person.


<page 7>
-RESPECTING EVENT FACILITIES AND THE DESERT-

Parking-
Park only where it is permitted and, once again, don't hang
out in the parking lot or on the streets.  Don't throw trash and
flyers on the ground.  Keep as low a profile as possible.

Tagging-
We lose locations because of tagging more than anything else.
Tagging simply tells the landlord that we don't have any
respect for him or his property even though it is the landlord
that has been so kind to share his property with us.  Tagging
makes insurance rates climb. If you see someone tagging,
explain to them that they are keeping you from being able to
rave in L.A.  Ask them if they want to continue to rave...
then ask them to please stop.  Make sure everyone in the
area hears you so that they also become involved in making
the tagger stop.

Trash-
Many times the property owner is shocked by the trash left in
the facility, especially bathrooms.  It only takes a few seconds
to find a trash can... a very worthwhile investment of your
time.  Trash and especially flyers should NEVER be dropped
outdoors.  The wind can blow them away and where they will
never be found... except perhaps by a park ranger or other
authority figure.  It is very difficult to say  "that trash
was already there when we got here" when the trash is a
bunch of rave flyers.  Gum, candy and cig butts can be just as
incriminating.

<page 8>
-RESECT FOR OTHER RAVERS-

Aggression/Violence-
Part of the attraction of a rave is that it can be a place to escape the
craziness of the rest of the world.  Leave your personal problems at the
door...    don't bring them into the celebration. Alcohol often brings
about aggressive behavior as well.

The rave scene prides itself on its' peaceful nature so there is absolutely
no tolerance for violence or aggression.  This even includes any
frustration that you may have with security, entry lines, etc.

A peaceful but enthusiastic attitude can quickly spread to others creating
a pocket of "vibe" that everyone will want to be a part of.  Acceptance of
others, even those different from
you, catches on quickly and creates a bond among all of us.  When outsiders
look in at our scene and see this bond, they cannot discredit it... they
can only see something positive...
perhaps it will be something that they will discuss with others. This is
the easieast way that we can create a more positive public image!

Blatant Selfishness-
This not only kills "the vibe" but it breaks us apart, making it difficult
to band together to help our movement as a whole.  A prime example of this
is blatant nitrous usage.  People sucking on balloons must know that  they
are jeopardizing EVERYONE'S right to rave and yet they continue to do it.
Their short-term high becomes more important than the future of raving
itself.  This kind of selfishness will certainly kill our future.  PLEASE
DON'T BRING NITROUS TO RAVES... leave it at home where it won't be a
selfish act that discredits all of us.


<page 9>
*CARELESSNESS IS OVERCOME
THROUGH ACCOUNTABILITY*

Carelessness, which sometimes is accidental, can easily be
overcome through a system of accountability.  It only takes
two friends to commit to be accountable to each other in
reminding the other if they are being careless.  The more
people you have in your accountability group (also called
"true friends"), the less likely you are to do something
careless. Create an acountability group with the
friends you rave with the most.   Ask
someone to be accountable for you RIGHT
NOW!!!!

All you have to do is give a simple reminder.... speak up and
say, "I don't think it's such a good idea for you to do that."
Here are some places where carelessness becomes a problem
for each of us in the rave movement:

Forgetting about any of the above selfishness issues-
Go ahead... re-read them!

Driving safely-
There is nothing wrong with being too messed up or too tired
to drive home... unless of course you try to drive anyway.
Ask a more sober friend from your accountability group to
drive or wait until someone is able to drive.  Coffee and other
stimulants won''t do the trick..  Take your time so you
and your friends can rave again another day!
	
<page 10>
Dealing with the wrong people-
Who are the wrong people? Unscrupulous drug dealers are just as problematic as
undercover drug enforcement agents. If you think getting something "bunk"
is a problem.... think about how bad it would be if you bought something
poisonous or lethal! This is becoming a bigger and bigger problem as drug
manufacturers are finding cheaper ways to make money. Most of them aren't
chemists and don't bother testing their new batch... you may become a "test
subject" for an unknown substance.   The media and law enforcement agencies
are infiltrating our masses to collect information to use against us at a
later time. You can never know who is who... so be careful.  Know who
you're dealing with.

Loitering outside of the venue-
This only draws attention to the  event and makes police curious enough to
"investigate."  Loitering also makes it more difficult to patrol a parking
area to look for people breaking into cars or doing other selfish
activities that hurt individual ravers and hurt the scene overall.  When
you're walking through a parking lot and you see people standing around ask
them to please go inside... but explain to them why it is important for
them to help in this regard.

Acting safely/Acting responsibly-
This is a broad area that has too many specific "infractions." Every once
in a while just ask yourself (and the people you''re accountable for) these
questions...

What am I doing?
Am I directly/indirectly harming myself or other ravers?
Am I keeping someone else from having a great time?
Am I helping build a positive public image about the rave scene?

<page 11>
*IGNORANCE IS OVERCOME THROUGH
COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION*


Ignorance is the easiest problem to overcome but it also depends on
individual efforts..  All we need to do is educate ourselves.  But two
things must happen before we can educate each other.

First, we must be willing to be educated... we must recognized that we are
being stupid and want to change.

And secondly, we must communicate with each other.

Since we have no organized arena for ravers to come together and
communicate we are held in the dark.  We must find a centralized forum
where together we can learn from our past mistakes and innovate our future.
Until we find that forum, it is up to you to discuss these problems and
re-shape our future.

The existence of rave culture depends entirely on you to simply talk with
one another... to share all of these important issues with others... with
people you meet for the first time.

<page 12>
Know what you're talking about-
Rumors and misinformation are splitting us apart.  Know the facts about the
realreasons for "busts"... or the dangers of certain substances.  Don't let
yourself be used as a tool for a promoters personal gain... or mouthpiece
for fabricated drug hysteria.

Know what you're taking-
We've already discussed unscrupulous drug dealers.  Don't combine lots of
different drugs!  There are combinations of substances that can quickly
become lethal.  In fact, more drug related casualties are due to lethal
combinations of drugs and alcohol than overdosing!

Let the DJ do the mixing!

Know your limit-
Your accountability group can help you with this.  Be careful trying to
"bump" your dosage.  Always let someone know exactly how much of what your
taking BEFORE you take it.

Know the law-
Get to know the specific legalities of possessing controlled substances.
Know the consequences if you're busted and ask yourself if it is worth the
risk.

Know how to handle yourself with the police-
Be cooperative but also know your rights regarding search and seizure laws
(especially in searching a vehicle).  Avoid dragging down the rave scene
with you.  Don't even mention
raves if you have a run in with officers.  Be afraid of the seriousness of
the consequences but don't let yourself be intimidated to the point that
you incriminate yourself.


<page 13>
Know what to do in case of an emergency-
This is a very important area if we wish to police ourselves at raves.

In case of an overdose or other drug related medical trauma
follow these steps before calling an ambulance.

1)Move the victim to a safe, private and discrete area away
from the noise and everyone else.

2)Find out EVERYTHING that they took... including
dosage, combinations and alcohol.

3)Find the victims friends.

4)Don't panic.  Some drug related trauma can be relieved
simply through sleeping it off.

5)Find someone trustworthy and knowledgeable about those
substances and get their advice. (Like Medi-Rave!)

6)Do NOT administer CPR, induce vomiting, or other
first aid proceedures unless fully capable and qualified.

7)In the desert or in a hot venue, dehydration
could be the problem, so try drinking some water.

8)If necessary ask security to call for help or ambulance.


<page 14>
Know your promoters-
It's time that ravers determine how much an event is worth.
If you think you're getting ripped off or if a promoter is
constantly being busted... STOP SUPPORTING THOSE EVENTS!!!  Try to remember
that promoter's  other events.  Think about what the promoter promised for
those raves...

Bust-free? (which might not really possible anymore)
Carnival rides/visuals/multiple areas?
Free water/gifts/etc.?
Big name Djs/bands?

So what do you and your accountability group do if you're
not getting your money's worth?  All of you should:

-find and tell the promoter that you're not satisfied
-leave a message(s) on the voice mail
-don't go to that promoter''s events again
-write letters to local music magazines
-post to the internet rave related mail groups
-throw your own event... large or small!!!

Remember that many promoters throw raves for a living and
that they must make money.  We're not asking promoters to
lose money!  We're thankful that they go through all the
hassle to even HAVE an event to go to.  However, we ARE
asking promoters to re-invest into the scene.... after all... if
the scene doesn't survive, the promoters don't survive either.

Support promoters that are helping our movement flourish...
that are innovating with creative ideas...that deliver what they
promise... that re-invest in the scene... that respect ravers,
DJs, venues, officers, public opinion and Mother Earth!

<page 15>
The best way to combat ignorance is to get and stay informed.
All that is required of this is communication!  Call unbiased
info lines to get the "scoop" on upcoming events.  Read the
local magazines that report on rave culture.

Perhaps the BEST way to get informed is... if you know
someone with an internet connection... get online!  Subscribe
to So-Cal Raves or visit web sites like Dr. Freeclouds and
Hyperreal (see next page).

 The information  and feedback offered by online
communication can really benefit you as an individual raver
and will help the rave movement flourish overall.  Here's
what you can get from being informed through the net:

-A calendar of upcoming raves, clubs, after-hours and rave-related radio/TV
shows
-Help determine which promoters and events are worthwhile
-Find out about events that you may have missed
-Read other ravers'' opinions of events, DJs, music, and mix tapes

Was checking out the ROM for the PB/CLE list.  Saw a pirate outfit 
listed in the 'burgh.

Went off driving in my car to check it out on Sunday....  Drove all 
around Oakland and up to Sq. Hill and did not hear anything.

Tried out the page listed for the station which is no longer online.

Anyone have some more info  and such on their broadcast etc.

I saw their postcard size flyer and it worked.  But the venue stinks. 
I know a friend of mine went to a concert their recently and they 
made you display your midriff,  metal detectored your body and would 
not let you bring anything into the Ampitheater.

The policy is so strict that they will not allow you to bring in your 
wallet if it has a chain on it,  like all of ours do...

Because of the false security some zine was quoted as saying that 
they had more security there than the Pentagon.

I can only hope they ease the false security,  otherwise alot of us 
will not be there.

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

have you been ther yourself? I have been there at least 7 times over the
past 3 years, and not once have I EVER had trouble with security...

>made you display your midriff,  metal detectored your body and would 
>not let you bring anything into the Ampitheater.

Oh shit! Darn! imagine that! people caring about what comes into a venue, so
as to increase safety!  Crap, looks like you'll have to leave your guns and
knives and marijuana bowls and things at home! ;) (just kidding, i don't
mean to insinuate that you personally would causee such problems... please
don't take that that way :)

>The policy is so strict that they will not allow you to bring in your 
>wallet if it has a chain on it,  like all of ours do...

well... maybe that has something to do with the fact that many ravers chains
could be considered dangerous weapons, due to length and width (gauge?) of
the chain... now, i'm not sure about that, but i'd bet if you didn't make a
big deal about it they wouldn't either...

>Because of the false security some zine was quoted as saying that 
>they had more security there than the Pentagon.

dumb journalists! the media is a sham... learn this, and you might be able
to watch shows like hard copy and only laugh at the idiocy :)

sounds like a really really stupid reason to _MISS_ acts like THE ORB!! Meat
Beat Manifesto, and CARL COX!!! I mean, really, just follow the rules yo! ;)

ok, anywya, i didn't mean this to be a personal attack against you in any

this is pretty long, and if you dont want to read it all, just hit delete,
but please try and read the last four paragraphs if you care.


sandman said (my stuff is indented):

anyone here think that they are maybe part of the problem?  Has ANYONE
here ever walked up to one of these "drugged up 14 year olds" and told
them that what they were doing isn't cool?  Or do you just shoot them
looks and talk shit about them behind their back?  Did you ever think that
a 14 year old on drugs is most likely having problems?  Have you ever
tried to help?  Of course not!  The solution is to just kick them out of
the scene so you wont have anything to do with them.
	
	sandman, its emotional generalisations like these that are the 	
	root of misunderstandings and miscommunication. 'have u ever 
	tried to help? of course not!'	is pushing it a bit far, dont
	you think?

	my whole point is this... we can be idealistic and say ppl should
	only do e and acid and pot at parties or whatever (god knows i 
	*used* to be idealistic) but after watching ppl in this scene and 
	the way they act...you become alot more pragmatic...

 	*I* cant change the way hundreds or thousands of ppl choose to 
	have fun. i can tell them whats good and bad (i worked on a drug
	info pamphlet almost 2 years ago...i handed out pamphlets and 
	flyers that told ppl to think about and respect their scene) but 
	alot of ppl are in the scene to _rebel_ and they dont take too
	well to ppl telling them to curb their fun, you know what i 
	mean...i *try*	to live by the phrase 'moderation in all thing' 
	but its not a catchphrase that too many ravers keep foremost in 
	their thoughts...



        Has anyone here ever told a drug-dealer to get the fuck out of an
event when they see them trying to sell to these children?  Doubtful.
After all, if people were to start doing that, they wouldn't be able to
get fucked up themselves.  Besides, people over 18 who do drugs aren't
problems or slowly destroying themselves because they know what they are
doing! How can people seriously believe this???????!!!!?????

	yeah, i remember the last time i went out i saw these big burly
	DRUG DEALERS threatening me with bodily harm if i didnt buy the 
	crack they were slinging and then they shoved all sorts of pills
	down my throat...:P  ok thats an exaggeration, but you get my
	drift...dealers (usually) dont force their wares on anyone (at 
	least from what i've seen)...they will quietly let it be known	
	what they have and how much, or they will (STUPIDLY) yell out	
	what they have and how much...this seems to be a ny phenomena	
	mainly, with one of the worst cases being casper 2 @ the newburgh
	skate park where the dealers were all standing by the snack bar
	YELLING what they had...there were like 5 or so ppl, whether they
	were competing or together i dunno, but it was ridiculous.	
	
	yes, some (most?) dealers are unscrupulous and will claim that 
	what they are slinging is something different than what it actually
	is, or push a drug like k or dust b/c theres a bigger profit margin
	in it for them, perhaps...i dunno. but there are also loads of
	nice ppl hooking their friends up with good stuff that are doing 
	a service, if only in the capacity of countering whatever weak
	or bunk shit is going around at the time.
	
	sandman, i dont know if you and danny/tranced are pointing at me 
	on this, BUT WHEN DID I EVER BRING AGE INTO QUESTION? i never said 
	at age "XX" you are now capable of handling yourself perfectly
	in any situation? if a person wants to self-destruct, and is fully
	aware of what they are doing, its going to be really hard to stop
	them, EVEN IF YOU ARE THEIR CLOSE FRIEND!, let alone a stranger
	who sees them abusing themselves at a party. personally speaking..
	i've seen ALOT of my friends burn out. and as a friend and someone
	who cared for them, i tried to help, but in the end, everyone has
	to travel their own path; sometimes ppl just wont accept your help.


  
        Has anyone here who bitches about "guidos", "preps", and "jocks"
ever taken the time to introduce themselves to one and talk?  HELL NO!  If
people had, they wouldn't be talking such MAD shit about them!

	again, with the generalisations. you dont know me, so dont assume
	...hell im turning your OWN WORDS around and using them to prove 
	MY point. if you want to get a clearer idea of where im coming
	from, why dont u go to hyperreal and check the archives of posts
	i've written over the past several years before you label me.
	(and as a frame of reference, im 24 yrs old, been going out since
	91/92,	i have a full-time job with a major corporation (yeah im
	a 9-5 guy by day) and i have curly hair :)


It all seems to me that many advocators of PLUR are only cool with
it when the people they are bonding with are EXACTLY like themselves.  In
that case, I guess you could say the nazis were very PLURy as well!

Some people here have got A LOT to learn.  If people here were
really concerned about PLUR and everyone having a good time, their first
thoughts would be about helping the troubled youths at events.  Also,
people wouldn't have a problem with diversity.  I don't know when Peace,
Love, Unity, and Respect became an elite thing!  And it truly disgusts me
when people can be so willing toi go against their advocacy of it due to
differences as petty as what clothes people wear!

	look, i go to parties to have fun and be with ppl i like...	
	i always meet NEW friends at every party and it gets better almost
	every time.  but i DONT go to parties to be a therapist to all
	the 'troubled youth'...i leave that to the liscensed professionals.
	i am just sick and tired of all the fucked up idiots who go to
	parties and abuse their bodies and expect ppl to take pity on them
	just so they can feel LOVED. more than anything, im getting sick 
	of the fact that ppl go to raves and hurt themselves just so
someone	can take care of them and pay a little attention to them. THERE'S 
	OTHER WAYS OF DOING IT. if u are crying out for help that badly, 
	kid, you need to get yourself checked out. before you go and label
	me as a big evil meanie, you have to understand that i've seen 
	some hairy shit go on over the past several years. i've had
	friends arrested and sent to jail for ridiculously long periods of
	time, i've had friends OD and DIE at parties, i've woken up to see
	someone sitting outside my door with their WRISTS SLASHED and i 
	get covered with their blood as i rush them to the emergency room
	before they die of blood loss. so yeah im pretty fucking angry and
	bitter at all the IDIOTS out there. 
	
	im sick of having to take care
	of them, they need to learn to take care of themselves sooner or 
	later, coz i think its a prety important basic SKILL. i've tried
	so much more than you know in the past...so if you are up to the
	task, cool, more power to ya, you're gonna need it...as far as 
	i personally am concerned, its a judgement call; but the days of 
	taking care of every person i see having a bad time are definitely
	on the decline. and again, if you havent met me and dont know 
	what im like in real life, at least ask one of my friends or try 
	and meet me. neither i nor my friends are ever hard to find.

If you and others feel this way, age should not be an issue.

	again, when did i ever say that? re *read* my first post...read for 
	_content_ not for what u think you see.  I said if a 16 yr old
	wants to do k, fine as long as they know what they are doing. if a
	35 yr old guy gets dusted and freaks out at a party...its NOT ok 
	just b/c of his age.

	im just a bitter jaded old raver who has lost his idealism in the
	concept that raves are the social movement that will change our 
	world forever. anymore, with the scene as it is, it's *still* all
	about the vibe and going out and having fun and enjoying yourself 
	and respecting yourself and others by not infringing on their fun
	as well. 
	

danny/tranced said:

everyone knows the pointing game.. but the finger never twists... I'm
guilty of it as well... but I think, plur aside, we all have to stop
categorizing people into groups.. assuming you have someone's entire life
story figured out by their age, and the way the appear to you, contributes
to the mass ignorance that keeps prejudice alive... your eyes face
outwards to the world in front of you, and they can sometimes trick you..

	good words danny, i hope everyone takes them to heart, i could 
	stand to be reminded of it more often. thank you.

dori said:

Really, it doesn't matter WHAT you're on as long as you can handle it -
part of the reason it's an exciting party is because you ARE pretty free
to do what you want and unfortunately, like lots of things we have to
deal with what other people do even if we don't like it.  I just try not
to look when I see someone who's a little too fucked up for his/her own
good.

	amen dori to the first sentence. i think the second sentence is
	quite a succinct encapsulation of why our scene is where it is now
	(on the east coast circuit anyway). too many ppl have given up
	on caring or trying to care. some of us are just burned out and
	cant give anymore, other ppl just never really gave a shit and just
	went for theirs 24/7 and squeezed all they could out of it. they
	either crashed and burned or went on to be USERS (in all senses of 
	the word) in another scene. good riddance. 
	

Apocalypse / joE said:


Personally I think that it is silly to condemn a person for
choosing drug A over drug K.  As long as the person understands the risks
involved, the necessity of moderation and are responsible enough to use
themin a way that doesn't affect my enjoyment of a party (i.e. wigging out
andattacking me for being the anti-christ) let them alone.  Part of
respecting someone is allowing them the freedom of choice even if we
don't agree.
		
	thank you joe...you have your fun, ill have mine, and together 
	we can all have a blast. i hope everyone rereads the last sentence
	you wrote. 


mikegee:

I can't stand some of the misguided media coverage myself
(hard copy) but to totally deny that part of the thing behind raves (for
some) is drugs, and to claim that raves have some higher meaning; you are
fooling yourself. Raves are a hedonistic escape, a temporary autonomous
zone, where everyone is FREE to do what they want, and for many that
includes drugs.
Look- I am a drug user myself, and I don't feel like a hypocrite when I
say that things need to change. I think people need to acknowledge that
perhaps doing drugs can be dangerous, can lead to trouble, can lead to
death. Perhaps people need to stop worrying that their own drug use is
being criicized or is in danger and start thinking about the larger
picture. That young kids may be hurting themselves with drugs that people
know LITTLE about.

	this touched on something that tatochip mentioned as well.
	>>__**EDUCATION__**<< go to hyperreal. you cant think of a more
	convenient and accessible source of information. as with most other
	responsible users, i took time to educate myself before i ever put 
	anything in my body. i think ive read nearly every damn thing there
	is out there at hyperreal and on alt.drugs before i ever ingested
	a drug. and if i chose to do something, it was with a full 
	acceptance and comprehension of the risks involved. do what u want,
	just do it wisely so u dont end up in a corner or even worse dead. 

	you guys want a concrete, pracitical solution to what you CAN DO 
	to change/help the scene? PUT OUT FLYERS AND PAMPHLETS EDUCATIING
	PEOPLE ABOUT DRUGS. more than anything else, its not knowing what 
	you are putting in your body that leads to accidents at raves.

	if this is something you want to do, theres a wealth of knowledge 
	ON THIS LIST ALONE that exists...i know in the past when we worked
	on our drug info pamphlet, alot of ppl came forward and offered 
	their services and donated alot to help put this out. from info 
	gathering, to fact checking, to design and layout of the 	
	flyer/pamphlet, to printing, to distribuiton...its all right here.

	and i will volunteer to help organise the entire project if you all
	so desire. SO STOP COMPLAINING AND BITCHING, this is one of the
 	most concrete things you can do that will ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT.

	i know im gonna come across as a really mean person who doesnt give
	a shit, but thats really not me. im just sick of idealistic
	bullshit that doesnt get anyone anywhere. im all for action, as long
	as it show results. im not a big narcotic using drug dealing child
	beating	monster...i've already said that i 99% of the time stick to the 
	"GOOD" (to use your term...hahaha) drugs. i do care, and i dont
	want to see anyone get hurt, but im sick of the ignorance. if you want
	to change this, i offer my help.



peace   (both within and without)
love 	(for yourself, the music, and the scene)

hello everyone -- welcome to the tenth issue of orbitrecords enews.  a lot 
of time has passed since our last issue, and there are a lot of developments 
to mention.  not only have we released a new orbitrecord, but there are even 
more coming soon.  

as usual, here is a brief synopsis of our current projects:


[ .x09 ]

.x09's fzz ep was released in march as a strictly limited 12".  the 
experimental music on the release has generated a lot of comments for 
us, both good and bad.  while some people really enjoy the new directions 
present in fzz, others say the music is far too repetitive and minimal.  
for a short glimpse of a favorable outlook on fzz, check out the review in 
issue 50 of URB magazine.  we knew not everyone would love fzz when we 
decided to release the music, but we felt strongly that the sounds .x09 
created were truly unique and liked the music very much ourselves.  For
some examples of what this release sounds, this URL (part of the
orbitrecords website):

     [ http://hyperreal.com/music/labels/orbitrecords/artists/x09/ ]


[ heatsync : or004 ]

heatsync, a new artist to orbitrecords, recently completed their work for 
the upcoming "jupiter ep".  currently being pressed, orbitrecords will 
release this 4-track 12" ep in mid-August.  a departure from our .x09 
release, the heatsync ep is a return to the basics of dance music.  
driving rhythms coupled with swirling analog synthesizer tones forms the 
backbone for all of heatsync's work, and this collection of songs is no 
exception.

a collaboration between seattle's grooveneedle records and orbitrecords, 
heatsync's work is a fresh look at dancefloor oriented sounds.  familiar 
elements from techno roots are all present, but the fusion of these 
elements forges something entirely new.  shortly after orbitrecords 
releases heatsync's jupiter ep, grooveneedle records will release a second 
collection of heatsync's work, the source ep.


[ the cumulonimbus : or005 ]

after a great deal of work in the studio, the first ep from the 
cumulonimbus, "amber," has been completed.  the long-anticipated ep will
be released in september 1996.  initial feedback from demos of the work 
has been overwhelmingly positive -- from the fast-paced trance sounds of 
the title track "amber" to the slower, atmospheric, electro-influenced 
"monochrome," the endless studio revision has paid off.  

like heatsync, the work of the cumulonimbus is a step beyond rigidly
defined genre-based dance music.  the amber ep draws influences from
jungle, electro, and trance to create addicting rhythms and grooves.
whatever the terms are, the cumulonimbus has created a unique sound that
transcends musical genre, placing it beyond the average dance record.


[ ad infinitum ]

at orbitrecords, we are very excited about our next two releases.  with 
the heatsync ep, the cumulonimbus ep, and several other projects we've 
only hinted at so far, we feel our artists have pushed new boundaries with 
electronic dance music without alienating the roots that glue it together.
as usual, keep your eyes on the lookout for these releases, and if you 
haven't already, check out our website and download some samples.  the 
music should speak for itself.

please don't hesitate to contact us for more information at 
or@hyperreal.com.  we're eager to hear what you have to say.

Alrighty folks;
        It seems like a lot of people on this list are going to TRIBUTE fri
and 720 sat, (including myself). Sooooo, how 'bout a net meet???  It seems
like I should know a lot of you and I don't. I'm not very good at keeping a
schedule or knowing what time it is at raves so I'd like to propose that we
have a TRIBUTE net meet somewhere right after Deadly Budas set, or
something. I'm not good at making stupid decisions that have to do with
organizing people I hardly know. Just letting everyone know i'm interested
in a little unity within and without our little electronic mail medium of
understanding.
        oh,  Hossam and Steve: You both mentioned you have crash space. I
know not whether i am staying for sunday night yet; I might need it  : )
I'm contemplating on just wandering around celveland saturday afternoon
with my freinds and make fun of strangers who look at us weird(!), and it
would be cooler if we had a big caravan of ravers stalking the streets
awaiting the coming of 720...
i don't think i've ever been to cleveland before (i'm so excited!!)
        email me or just post your mutual interest in a net meet so we can
get details accomplished. Thank you.

Could it really be?  Do my eyes decieve me?  Dare I say it -
  
   the return of HARDCORE to pittsburgh!

First d-cypol tore it up at a renegade, and people were happy.
Then Ortho - skinner gave us a taste of the industrial strength - plus
 the party had a great frendly atmosphere.  People were very happy.
Next Deadly Buda is back, oh my gawd - it's the 'fuck-you man'!  People are 
 already having corinarys from sensations of pure joy.
And if that wasn't enough - and by the way, it wasn't :) -
  a weekly hardcore event!

*entering brief realism mode*
 Can 168 actually keep a hardcore night going?  I mean, there was an 
awesome line-up for steel city on tues, but the place wasn't exactly 
packed, and I know there's a much smaller hardcore following than jungle, 
at least in pgh.  
*exiting realism mode, and may we never hear from it again*

Soooo -> everybody come out, and I'll give you some candy and I'll 
introduce you to some nice fun people (hey, maybe even myself), and you 
can even pet my hedgehog!

Also, I'd suggest coming merely to hear the uplifting trancy stylings of 
*Product 19*.  Listen for the P.E. "bring the noise" track - its like 
totally good and stuff.

l8s,
  Geoff Maddock

168 is a very smooth place.  I like it a bunch.  But the times that I 
have stopped in (4 times)  it has been empty.  On 2 occassions I was 
the only patron in the place.

I wish they would do some promos outside of the immediate scener's.  
We all know what time it is and what is going on,  but a whole lot of 
infrequent visitors to the scene surely do not.

I have seen several decent clubs vaporize over the years. (anyone 
remember Strip's Edge?? tell me that was not a prime place and setup 
for a happening club).  It seems that the scene is just too small 
here to support anything except perhaps the occassional big get 
together event.  

Hope I am wrong just this one time.  I like Buda's style mostly.  I 
use to sit around Turbo Zen (his store) and listen to his soundz.
The others I am not familiar with but I am sure they hold their own 
fine.

-Rave on.

Subject: 	|NER| Handbooks for Responsible Raving

In light of some heavy media and law enforcement attention on the rave
scene, bunch of us on So-Cal Raves realized that it was time we centralize
and begin educating ourselves.

The end result (to this point) is a first draft of a handbook for
responsible raving that we are giving out at local events.  The 16 page
booklet is called "How Much Do You Love Raving?"

The basic angle of it is that our own selfishness, carelessness and
ignorance is keeping our movement from positive growth.  It outlines ways
to combat these obstacles and encourages people to begin communicating
about the importance of individual efforts in responsible raving.

Enclosed is a text-only version of this first draft.  I encouage each of
you to read it and learn from the mistakes we've made in Southern
California.  I also hope that you will in turn print out your own versions
of the information and pass it out to ravers in your communities.

It's time to innovate a more perfect future.

Please e-mail me if you have any questions or comments.


Thanks for your time,

Kc-of-DUNE

One more time for all of you who haven't heard about this event... I just 
want to help promote this as well as I can... Once again, this is 
absolutely *PHREE* and I guaruntee that it will be 100% sonik hysteria..  
Hell, I'm driving 12 hours to see Mr. Bevacqua hit the decks!  Hope to

with the TZ alien on the front.  If you don't notice that, I'll also be 
the 5'7" guy making the "Satan's horns" sign with my hands to Buda and 
Timestretch's sets... :P

LESS OF A FOLLOWING of Hardcore? YO! Pittsburgh started on hardcore and I 
think with the response that we saw at the last two Jive Turkeyz events
FUEL must have a good idea of how the Hardcore is supposed to be going.

FUEL Productions is run by this dude Stickman and he's been doin stuff 
since '93. He's Jive Turkeyz as well and I hope that he knows what he's 
doing. Last week I saw him in the Squirrel Hill area then at the Beehive 
in oakland and then in south side and again in oakland for the movies, he 
must have a teleport device cause I don't know how he does it.

If more people promote like Fuel then I think 168 and all raves could MAX 
out and it would be dope

Bigup to Stickman.  I remember him and Hanibal from back in 92-93 
when they were hanging at T. Zen.with Buda.  

Two good guys who have given alot to the scene I think.  

Although Stickman was all over teleporting spreading the love potionz 
the crowds remain the same.  What I mean is the burgh' needs some 
fresh blood.  I mean perhaps the stiffs will arrive then become 
smooths like us.  We ned to convert some people or at least borrow 
their bodies for the ticket count.

By flyer tossing really the people reached are the same people who 
already know.  Not kicking the system in the head but for the most 
part it is true in Pgh.

Us net freaks know about everything going on.  We need to reach the 
casual raver and the interested persons.  Perhaps some small clips on 
Community stations (WYEP, PTS RCT etc.)...

Perhaps an In Pittsburgh list for big events..???  I mean In PGH and 
City Paper have been quite friendly lately.  I do not mean to 
commercialize things but unless you are in the scene or at a coffee 
shop all the time you really do not even know there is a scene.

enuff characters.

first off... WILL SOMONE PLEASE SHOW ME WHERE THE HELL IN THAT POST I EVER
FUCKING SAID THAT ALL 14 YEAR OLD KIDS GO TO RAVES TO GET FUCKED UP?

jesus, i mean this is the second or third time someone has said this about
my posts and i DONT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE READING THIS FROM...if i am
insinuating this, then show me where i am saying it, and please accept my
apology...but i am taking pains to specifically *NOT* generalise in this
manner...so, go back, reread it, and show me where i am saying "all 14 yr
olds go to raves to get fucked up"



second.. watch your reply-to field...if you cant show me where i said "all
14 yr olds go to raves to get fucked up" you sure are gonna make yourself
look stupid in the eyes of hundreds of ppl.


peace,
hossam

Sounds good.  how about bring your own name tag, if you so desire?  Meet 
up by the tables perhaps?

Just a suggestion, better ones are welcome.

Yeah, I agree.  168 is a great, great place and there's a lot of talent 
and fun to be had in Pgh, but I think the scene needs to expand.  that's 
always iffy cuz you fear bringing in fakes.  but everyone starts 
somewhere and if people like it and stay, well then they're not fakes 
anymore, are they?

open question:  how do yo feel aobut bringing in a whole buncha newbies?  
some people fear it, soem people welcome.  Just wondering if there was 
any consensus.

Sorry about the massive bandwidth consumption but this is important...

There's been a HUGE amount of response and questions from all over the
world on how to assemble these booklets.  Below is a basic description on
how to set up the text layout and assembly.  Enclosed is a revised version
of the text based on some of those comments.


If you follow the proceedure below, you can make a handy little booklet
that fits perfectly into your back pocket and doesn't end up on the floor.
We're making ours with flourescent paper to further entice people to keep
them and take 'em home to read.


HOW TO CONFIGURE THE TEXT BY PAGE NUMBER:
(3 sheets per booklet- front and back)

HOW TO ASSEMBLE THE BOOKLETS:

1)Layout the text with the corresponding page #s as above

2)After placing the text into quadrants on each page, photocopy them double
sided as indicated above (top to top)

3)If you've done everything correctly and accounted for some margin space,
you should be able to cut each page EXACTLY across the middle of the page
so that you end up with 5 horizontal half sheets of paper with printing on
front and back.

4)Arrange the half sheets in numerical order.

5)Fold the half sheet EXACTLY through the center so that it makes a booklet

6)Staple through the binding (you may need a long stapler!)

7)Pass them out to all the ravers you meet!



Feel free to costumize them as needed for your community...

Like the first paragraph says "This is booklet is not intended to be
definative in its' approach... it is a starting point for communication
about very important issues that directly affect each of us."


RESPECT+
ACCOUNTABILITY+
COMMUNICATION & EDUCATION=
RAVE ELATION FOREVER !

how much do you love raving?


a handbook for responsible raving


<P A G E  1 BLANK>


<P A G E  2>
The Goodvibe Starts from Within

Stop complaining
about everyone else.  What about yourself?
Are you treating others
the way you want to be treated?
That is the only route toward the
positivity that will unite us all.
Don't be afraid!
Fear is the source of all our conflicts and
aggressions.
The next time someone gives you a hard look,
understand that they are still captive
to their fears like you once were.
Don't resort to a negative response because that
will only create more  negativity.
Smile! Let the goodwill within you flow!
Maybe your strength and love will give them
the courage to open themselves,
and they will follow the new direction.
It is all up to you...
						-tito



<P A G E  3>
This booklet is not intended to be definitive in its' approach...
it is a starting point for communication about very important
issues that directly affect each of us.

Our hope is that it will encourage you to step away
from the music with some friends for a moment so
that you can discuss the importance of individual
efforts in responsible raving.




Yeah?  So what's the problem?

It is becoming more and more difficult to continue our cultural
phenomenon known as the "Rave Movement." The reason
that raving is more difficult is because raves and even smaller
parties are being shut down by the police and other authorities
at an alarming rate.  Apart from DJs, sound and lights, in
order to throw a successful event you need secure locations,
permits/permission and insurance.  With any of these
ingredients missing there is a strong chance that the event will
not get off the ground.

In order to get these ingredients we must go to people outside
of the rave community... the public.


<P A G E  4>
It is the public that formulates opinions about us as ravers.
Most times it is public opinion that keeps a landowner from
granting us on his property... that keeps an insurance
company from providing a necessary policy... that keeps civil
agencies from issuing a permit that makes an event legal and
"unbustable."

The police are not shutting us down because of a giant
conspiracy against ravers, raving and living life to its'
fullest...

They are shutting us down because of our own...

selfishness
carelessness
&
ignorance

If we rid ourselves of these anchors, our public image will
greatly improve and our fragile movement will surely
flourish.

How?  What can you do?  A lot!

YOU can make or break our movement!

<P A G E  5>
It is incredibly easy to combat selfishness,
carelessness and ignorance and still have the time
of your life... maybe even have a better time than you've
ever experienced.  Imagine having the best time you've ever
had at a rave... now couple that with the feeling of
satisfaction and accomplishment that you would get from
helping build up and progress our scene... knowing that you
did your part.


*SELFISHNESS IS OVERCOME
BY RESPECT*

Each rave event is not yours alone... it is a communal
experience made for everyone.  It is the togetherness of
everyone that makes raves fun and fulfilling.  To completely
kill a group experience it only takes a few individuals who
don't understand the concept of community.  Here are some
examples of selfish acts.  Each is  followed by a way to
overcome the selfishness.

-RESPECTING  THE PUBLICS'' OPINION OF RAVERS-
Visibility of drugs and alcohol-
Drugs are taboo to most of the public that forms an opinion about us... the
same public that gives us permission to gather and rave.  If you feel that
you need to have your mood
elevated, please be discrete.  Don't let anyone see the presence of drugs.
Don't give them a reason to accuse us.  Nitrous balloons are the biggest
problem in this area.  Balloons can easily be seen from a great distance
and the hiss of the valves makes it very easy to find the tanks.  PLEASE
DON'T BRING BALLOONS OR NITROUS TANKS INTO RAVES!   Similarly marijuana can
easily be smelled.  It is more difficult to findbut don't make it obvious.

<P A G E  6>
Being rude or obnoxious to non-ravers-
Rude and obnoxious behavior does nothing but upset people,
sometimes to the point of having them call the police.  Please
be polite to any "outsider" that you encounter while on the
way to or away from a rave.  Be polite to everyone for that
matter!

Noise-
Noise is a very big problem in most residential areas and is
often the reason for shut-downs.  Please be as quiet as
possible going to site.  Playing car radios loud, horn
honking, screeching tires and yelling can be louder than the
sound system enclosed in the venue.  Loitering around in the
parking area is illegal and only draws unwanted attention to
the party.  As you're walking to the door remember that you
are only moments away from being able to make as much
noise as you want!!

Fireworks-
Although cool to see, fireworks are a reason for instant shut-
downs. We all know about the danger of fires.  Enough said.
Additionally, the loud explosions can be misconstrued as
gun-shots which will get the police to the location faster than
anything.

Guns and Violence-
Neither of these belong at a rave.  It is our non-violent nature
that sets us apart from the rock and rap scenes.  Hopefully, a positive
rave experience will change the life of a violent natured person.


<P A G E  7>
-RESPECTING EVENT FACILITIES AND THE DESERT-

Parking-
Park only where it is permitted and, once again, don't hang
out in the parking lot or on the streets.  Don't throw trash and
flyers on the ground.  Keep as low a profile as possible.

Tagging-
We lose locations because of tagging more than anything else.
Tagging simply tells the landlord that we don't have any
respect for him or his property even though it is the landlord
that has been so kind to share his property with us.  Tagging
makes insurance rates climb. If you see someone tagging,
explain to them that they are keeping you from being able to
rave in L.A.  Ask them if they want to continue to rave...
then ask them to please stop.  Make sure everyone in the
area hears you so that they also become involved in making
the tagger stop.

Trash-
Many times the property owner is shocked by the trash left in
the facility, especially bathrooms.  It only takes a few seconds
to find a trash can... a very worthwhile investment of your
time.  Trash and especially flyers should NEVER be dropped
outdoors.  The wind can blow them away and where they will
never be found... except perhaps by a park ranger or other
authority figure.  It is very difficult to say  "that trash
was already there when we got here" when the trash is a
bunch of rave flyers.  Gum, candy and cig butts can be just as
incriminating.

<P A G E  8>
-RESECT FOR OTHER RAVERS-

Aggression/Violence-
Part of the attraction of a rave is that it can be a place to escape the
craziness of the rest of the world.  Leave your personal problems at the
door...    don't bring them into the celebration. Alcohol often brings
about aggressive behavior as well.

The rave scene prides itself on its' peaceful nature so there is absolutely
no tolerance for violence or aggression.  This even includes any
frustration that you may have with security, entry lines, etc.

A peaceful but enthusiastic attitude can quickly spread to others creating
a pocket of "vibe" that everyone will want to be a part of.  Acceptance of
others, even those different from
you, catches on quickly and creates a bond among all of us.  When outsiders
look in at our scene and see this bond, they cannot discredit it... they
can only see something positive...
perhaps it will be something that they will discuss with others. This is
the easieast way that we can create a more positive public image!

Blatant Selfishness-
This not only kills "the vibe" but it breaks us apart, making it difficult
to band together to help our movement as a whole.  A prime example of this
is blatant nitrous usage.  People sucking on balloons must know that  they
are jeopardizing EVERYONE'S right to rave and yet they continue to do it.  T
heir short-term high becomes more important than the future of raving
itself.  This kind of selfishness will certainly kill our future.  PLEASE
DON'T BRING NITROUS TO RAVES... leave it at home where it won't be a
selfish act that discredits all of us.


<P A G E  9>
*CARELESSNESS IS OVERCOME
THROUGH ACCOUNTABILITY*

Carelessness, which sometimes is accidental, can easily be
overcome through a system of accountability.  It only takes
two friends to commit to be accountable to each other in
reminding the other if they are being careless.  The more
people you have in your accountability group (also called
"true friends"), the less likely you are to do something
careless. Create an acountability group with the friends you rave with the
most.   Ask someone to be accountable for you RIGHT NOW!!!!

All you have to do is give a simple reminder.... speak up and
say, "I don't think it's such a good idea for you to do that."
Here are some places where carelessness becomes a problem
for each of us in the rave movement:

Forgetting about any of the above selfishness issues-
Go ahead... re-read them!

Driving safely-
There is nothing wrong with being too messed up or too tired
to drive home... unless of course you try to drive anyway.
Ask a more sober friend from your accountability group to
drive or wait until someone is able to drive.  Coffee and other
stimulants won''t do the trick..  Take your time so you
and your friends can rave again another day!
	
<P A G E  10>
Dealing with the wrong people-
Who are the wrong people? Unscrupulous drug dealers are just as problematic
as undercover drug enforcement agents. If you think getting something
"bunk" is a problem.... think about how bad it would be if you bought
something poisonous or lethal! This is becoming a bigger and bigger problem
as drug manufacturers are finding cheaper ways to make money. Most of them
aren't chemists and don't bother testing their new batch... you may become
a "test subject" for an unknown substance.   The media and law enforcement
agencies are infiltrating our masses to collect information to use against
us at a later time. You can never know who is who... so be careful.  Know
who you're dealing with.

Loitering outside of the venue-
This only draws attention to the  event and makes police curious enough to
"investigate."  Loitering also makes it more difficult to patrol a parking
area to look for people breaking into cars or doing other selfish
activities that hurt individual ravers and hurt the scene overall.  When
you're walking through a parking lot and you see people standing around ask
them to please go inside... but explain to them why it is important for
them to help in this regard.

Acting safely/Acting responsibly-
This is a broad area that has too many specific "infractions." Every once
in a while just ask yourself (and the people you''re accountable for) these
questions...

What am I doing?
Am I directly/indirectly harming myself or other ravers?
Am I keeping someone else from having a great time?
Am I helping build a positive public image about the rave scene?

<P A G E  11>
*IGNORANCE IS OVERCOME THROUGH
COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION*


Ignorance is the easiest problem to overcome but it also depends on
individual efforts..  All we need to do is educate ourselves.  But two
things must happen before we can educate each other.

First, we must be willing to be educated... we must recognized that we are
being stupid and want to change.

And secondly, we must communicate with each other.

Since we have no organized arena for ravers to come together and
communicate we are held in the dark.  We must find a centralized forum
where together we can learn from our past mistakes and innovate our future.
Until we find that forum, it is up to you to discuss these problems and
re-shape our future.

The existence of rave culture depends entirely on you to simply talk with
one another... to share all of these important issues with others... with
people you meet for the first time.

<P A G E  12>
Know what you're talking about-
Rumors and misinformation are splitting us apart.  Know the facts about the
realreasons for "busts"... or the dangers of certain substances.  Don't let
yourself be used as a tool for a promoters personal gain... or mouthpiece
for fabricated drug hysteria.

Know what you're taking-
We've already discussed unscrupulous drug dealers.  Don't combine lots of
different drugs!  There are combinations of substances that can quickly
become lethal.  In fact, more drug related casualties are due to lethal
combinations of drugs and alcohol than overdosing!

Let the DJ do the mixing!

Know your limit-
Your accountability group can help you with this.  Be careful trying to
"bump" your dosage.  Always let someone know exactly how much of what your
taking BEFORE you take it.

Know the law-
Get to know the specific legalities of possessing controlled substances.
Know the consequences if you're busted and ask yourself if it is worth the
risk.

Know how to handle yourself with the police-
Be cooperative but also know your rights regarding search and seizure laws
(especially in searching a vehicle).  Avoid dragging down the rave scene
with you.  Don't even mention
raves if you have a run in with officers.  Be afraid of the seriousness of
the consequences but don't let yourself be intimidated to the point that
you incriminate yourself.


<P A G E  13>
Know what to do in case of an emergency-
This is a very important area if we wish to police ourselves at raves.

In case of an overdose or other drug related medical trauma
follow these steps before calling an ambulance.

1)Move the victim to a safe, private and discrete area away
from the noise and everyone else.

2)Find out EVERYTHING that they took... including
dosage, combinations and alcohol.

3)Find the victims friends.

4)Don't panic.  Some drug related trauma can be relieved
simply through sleeping it off.

5)Find someone trustworthy and knowledgeable about those
substances and get their advice. (Like Medi-Rave!)

6)Do NOT administer CPR, induce vomiting, or other
first aid proceedures unless fully capable and qualified.

7)In the desert or in a hot venue, dehydration
could be the problem, so try drinking some water.

8)If necessary ask security to call for help or ambulance.


<P A G E  14>
Know your promoters-
It's time that ravers determine how much an event is worth.
If you think you're getting ripped off or if a promoter is
constantly being busted... STOP SUPPORTING THOSE EVENTS!!!  Try to remember
that promoter's  other events.  Think about what the promoter promised for
those raves...

Bust-free? (which might not really possible anymore)
Carnival rides/visuals/multiple areas?
Free water/gifts/etc.?
Big name Djs/bands?

So what do you and your accountability group do if you're
not getting your money's worth?  All of you should:

-find and tell the promoter that you're not satisfied
-leave a message(s) on the voice mail
-don't go to that promoter''s events again
-write letters to local music magazines
-post to the internet rave related mail groups
-throw your own event... large or small!!!

Remember that many promoters throw raves for a living and
that they must make money.  We're not asking promoters to
lose money!  We're thankful that they go through all the
hassle to even HAVE an event to go to.  However, we ARE
asking promoters to re-invest into the scene.... after all... if
the scene doesn't survive, the promoters don't survive either.

Support promoters that are helping our movement flourish...
that are innovating with creative ideas...that deliver what they
promise... that re-invest in the scene... that respect ravers,
DJs, venues, officers, public opinion and Mother Earth!

<P A G E  15>
The best way to combat ignorance is to get and stay informed.
All that is required of this is communication!  Call unbiased
info lines to get the "scoop" on upcoming events.  Read the
local magazines that report on rave culture.

Perhaps the BEST way to get informed is... if you know
someone with an internet connection... get online!  Subscribe
to So-Cal Raves or visit web sites like Dr. Freeclouds and
Hyperreal (see next page).

 The information  and feedback offered by online
communication can really benefit you as an individual raver
and will help the rave movement flourish overall.  Here's
what you can get from being informed through the net:

-A calendar of upcoming raves, clubs, after-hours and rave-related radio/TV
shows
-Help determine which promoters and events are worthwhile
-Find out about events that you may have missed
-Read other ravers'' opinions of events, DJs, music, and mix tapes
-Find out more about DJs or bands you like
-Voice your frustrations about specific rave related issues
-Get advanced info on location, line-up, changes, and mergers
-Get info on specific drug-related warnings or scams
-Learn more about rave/DJ culture
-Find out about unpromoted events and micro-raves
-MOST IMPORTANTLY...
Find new raver friends that share similar tastes and views with you.

Very true!
We need some ingenious marketing here!
Now its kinda an uphill battle since i think i heard that Allegheny County
ranks like 2nd behind Dade Country in Florida for having the most old folks

Now some ideas on improving the scene:

Iron city raving night at some old steel mill

Free admission to those over the age of 50 or those with a medic-alert
braclet( these make great ravetoys)

Professional Drug dealers from the Pirates and the Steelers!

Wacky rave night at Chancy's

Well all joking aside unless raving reall hits the mass US market via mtv
and all in my honest and humble opinion pittsburgh wont be able to get such
a massive scene going
I think many many dedicated people are here, but it takes more than that.

Just my two cents,
jef

Now I am not really into the scene.  Have not been to an event here 
yet since returning in November.   

Something though that I notice is that although Pittsburgh is 
comfortably located near Balitmore and DC and Cleveland and Columbus 
are not that far either you would think we could draw some 
non-locals???

What is the largest event the burgh' has ever had??? PowerRave???  
Probably one of the Turbo Zen parties and even they were micro on the 
scale.

Pittsburgh needs more people to come in to our partys.  I am sure it 
has not changed very much.

That would be a good first step.

Secondly we need a good marketing campaign.  Not just flyers to the 
normal crowd but to those who might not even know there is a scene.

Well that is it for now...

Yes - right on for stickman being around every corner handing out flyers, 
and basically giving pgh a jolt. ;)  But furreal - reaching new people is 
a very good idea.  I mean lots of people probably see a rave flyer and 
either say 1)What the hell is this, none of these names/places make any 
sense to me or 2)What the hell is this, oh its a rave, they (suck|are all 
about drugs|are about looking a certain way).   Probably the best thing 
to do is bring a 'newbie', bring a friend, and be friendly with 
unfamiliar faces a rave - it will definately come back to you.

I'd agree for the most part, even though its still needed, coz 
word-of-mouth isn't quite enough.  Something I was thinking of was 
putting out a one-page monthly of bi-weekly calander of ALL the events in 
pittsburgh - kind of like a paper R.O.M. with info-lines, and maybe some 
text describing things going on in general, maybe explaining 
djs/styles/events/locations that 'non-ravers' might not understand.  
Put them out to all the places the kids go, and wha-la. Sort of.

Also the In-Pittsbugh or City Paper idea is a good idea.  Most would-be 
rave attendee's do check out one or the other in a week.  I don't read 
them myself, but there's also those other pittburgh 'music-scene' mags 
that are around "da core" and "the rock & roll reporter" - which might be 
a way to go.  Or even for the really ambitious, putting out something 
like these mags for pgh's 'underground' music scene - ravers, punks, 
goths, indie rockers, etc...  Hmmm, maybe I'm going to far.

er..same here.

Well steph & pete, I'll be there with bells on (perhaps literally).  I'll 
be donning my gas-mask until a suffocate from skanking to the hardcore.  
The 'name-tag' thing is ok by me, coz I'v got a whole box of those "Hello 
my name is.." stickers.  I'll probably be wearing red nikes or home-made 
velcro shoes.  Another way to know me is look for the one dancing really 
crazy and bad, and who always jumps up in the air and then falls on his 
butt.  That will be me. ;) If I get out to da-mart there'll be candy and 
fruity drink for all.  See ya there gabbers!

> Just a suggestion, better ones are welcome.

Ok - here's a suggestion.  Instead of name-tags, we each bring a can of 
pudding with the pull-back top.  If we find each other, we can trade 
pudding.  If not, we can console ourselves with the fact that we have a 
can of pudding.  Either way, it words out.  Just a suggestion. ;)

go for it.  i'd be happy to see as many new followers as possible.
we just have to be careful what we are advertising when we try to bring
in these rookies.  it's very easy to get people to come to raves by mentioning
drugs...and i'm sure you all agree that that's not the thing to do.

so how do we get these newbies interested?
how bout actually passing out fliers outside non-rave related clubs and such?
like standing outside metropol on panic bar night, or one of the many other 
clubs in the area.  i'd go for the in pittsburgh idea too.  the only people who
read that are people looking for something to do, and most of them would fit
in the "underground seeking" category i think.

love,
ryu

To add to the effort since I want to be part of the scene,  I am 
going to start scanning in all the local event FLYERS  that I get as 
soon as I get them.

If it is cool I will post them to the mail list (will make them 50k 
max) and still in color.

Perhaps the peeps at HyperReal can give me some space to add the 
flyers in.

I too had thought about putting together like a 1 page pick flyer 
with scene info on it - a quick reference shall we say.

Let me know what you got in mind and perhaps we can work on something 
jointly.  I thought about this last week while sitting in 168 ...

Something though that I notice is that although Pittsburgh is

are not that far either you would think we could draw some 
non-locals???
================================================================= 

u 'burghers are scarey. each time i show up @ a pitt party,
there's got to be some naked dude either playing w/ himself
or charging the dj booth :) hmmm...duz this mean we'll be seeing
some 'stickbooty' tomorrow night to keep w/ traditions?

==================================================================
What is the largest event the burgh' has ever had??? PowerRave???  
Probably one of the Turbo Zen parties and even they were micro on the 
scale.
================================================================== 

i think tunnelvision beat that. and then that big party they
had at the science center also by udg, oh what wuz it called?
hossam

================================================================== 
Secondly we need a good marketing campaign.  Not just flyers to the 
normal crowd but to those who might not even know there is a scene.
================================================================== 

start a zine ( ala PLRM). if i could do it, anyone can. it duz
takes some organization & a li'l journalistic skillz tho.

hey tom, i believe i no longer hold the record for most posts

i believe this is the most posts on pb-cle-rave (by posters

You simply have to bring in "newbies" ..if you aren't growing, you're either
shrinking, or becoming an easy target.  The best defense is a good offense.
 Recruitment is an offensive strategy.

Any "movement"  has to have a youth movement.  Hitler did it, so did JFK.  

Expand the membership base and the ability to get goodies to pittsburgh goes
up, while the harassment level - cops, press, etc. will likely go down.

Just Don't recruit so fast that the core gets "diluted"

My two cents...for what their worth....about 1.3 cents {:-)

I could produce a b/w zine
I have a laser printer and some medium quality layout software.
send me stories, formulae, pictures, etc.
remember, many "Straights" wil be reading so keep it simple, explain
terms, etc.

also, send me ideas of distribution sites, e.g. slacker, coffeehouses...

If anyone wants to buy advertising to defray printing, paper costs, etc., let
me know

a collective effort will yield the best results.

While mailing large files like that to the list isn't really such a good
idea, I would be happy to allocate space on Hyperreal for the flyers.  In
fact, I have a directory there already for them :)

I've been trying to think of ways to make the webpage more fun too, and
flyers would do it!  Here's how you can put your files on hyperreal (for
those who haven't)... it's pretty easy.

FTP to hyperreal.com           * this command opens a connection to
				 hyperreal
cd incoming/pb-cle-raves       * this changes directories into the
				 pb-cle-raves directory for incoming
				 files
bin			       * this tells the machine you're going
				 to upload "binary" files (pictures,
				 sounds, etc)
put <filename>		       * places the file onto hyperreal.

 - or-

mput <filename> <..> <filename>  * places multiple files onto hyperreal.

quit 			       * closes the connection

That's it.  One important thing to do is either include a text file in
your uploads that says what each picture is or email me information
describing what each picture is ("file5.gif is a flyer from 168..").

Nuthin to it.

Who gives a damn about tight security...
Especially if the scene has such an opportunity as this one

#1 It reduces shady activity
#2 It prevents anyone from getting their head shot off
#3 I'll wait in line an extra hour so that I can be sure my saftey comes first.
#4 Would anyone like to add to this list.

Well folks I figured out how to post without an email address. 
Even though I haven't posted I have been reading the list everyday via the archives 
@ hyperreal.

It seems to me most people here agree that promotion needs to be stepped up.
The reason that things are the way they are now is basically because the
people who got the scene rolling are the only ones around who remmember
waht being a "promoter" is all about. Back in the day being a promoter meant
more than just flyering ravers and dropping a stack of flyers in a store.
I remmember back in the Turbozen days when ads WERE run in In Pittsburgh (when did 
that suddenly become "uncool"?) and I remember some of Buda's crazy promotion 
schemes. Like for Power Rave he had someone in a Godzilla suit walking around
Oakland in like 85 degree heat passing out flyers. For our first big rave back in '92 
it drew over 900 people. 

Stickman and FUEL also knew how to promote and still do.

UDG did a bangup jop promoting Free, Tunnelvision, JungleWarfare (along with the Lollipop
Posse) and word is John will be promoting the Rewind with 11 x 17 color posters.
John rollerbladed around town posting Tunnelvision flyers on almost every
telephone poll. John will be doing the same for The Rewind, and I'll be helping him.



The problem seems to not be that pittsburgh doesn't have enough people as someone said. 
We had about 3,000 at Tunnel Vision and that was just a year ago. Now we are lucky
if a party draws 300. 
The problem is some of the newer promoters came in when the scene was still rolling
after TunnelVision which gave them a false sense of promoting. IE:there was
now this BIG rave crowd. THey had no idea how it got to that point though, legwork!

We should take advantage of every opportunity: In Pittsburgh and City Paper are 
prime ideas, as well as having some of the college and pirate radio stations  announce
raves during their techno shows. We used to do this back in the day too.

One thing ENIT promises to be is BIG. This could take raves to the next level
as they are in Europeso it is a PRIME place to promote since alot of people
will have heard about ENIT but not even knew that a rave scene existed. I've
talked to quite a few people about this. One of things Buda and I did a few years back was
pass out Morph fliers (I know I know...) at Lollapalooza. You'd be suprised
how many ravers point to Morph, TunnelVision, or Synovial Fluid as their first party.
The reason is because we promoted the heck out of it back when promoter meant
more than party thrower. Just some thoughts.

BTWL
Some promoters take offense to suggestions on how they can bring more peoplein. 
The only way they will listen is enough people start suggesting things to help
and OFFERING help. People used to be comped to parties not because they were
down with the crew who threw it but becaused they COVERED PART OF THE CITY
with flyers. Both John Dwight and Buda used to have a map with pins in it indicating where
they had someone promoting. LIke I said it helped organize a citywide effort.

Another reason I think things have fallen off is that fliers got REALLY small when before they used to be fairly big.
I realize this saves money but its alot harder to throw out an 11 x 17 poster. Especically if
it has an attention getting design.

Sorry for the rant but I needed to let this out. Sorry for the formating of this message
also, I am using the lynx editor to send this so....

joe187 (finally some one w/ a clue) sed (& i will requote it all
cuz i'm replying this on to other lists):
=================================================================
Well folks I figured out how to post without an email address. 
Even though I haven't posted I have been reading the list everyday via the 
archives 
@ hyperreal.

It seems to me most people here agree that promotion needs to be stepped up.
The reason that things are the way they are now is basically because the
people who got the scene rolling are the only ones around who remmember
waht being a "promoter" is all about. Back in the day being a promoter meant
more than just flyering ravers and dropping a stack of flyers in a store.
I remmember back in the Turbozen days when ads WERE run in In Pittsburgh (when 
did 
that suddenly become "uncool"?) and I remember some of Buda's crazy promotion 
schemes. Like for Power Rave he had someone in a Godzilla suit walking around
Oakland in like 85 degree heat passing out flyers. For our first big rave back 
in '92 
it drew over 900 people.

============================================================================= 

alot of promotors forget the #1 job of a promotor is to promote yur
party. it's common sense if u don't flyer for yur party, nobody's
gonna show up.

that's exactly how the cleveland scene got started. when aquilon/smart
bar wuz going. the way they would get new kids wuz by giving free
passes on alternative college radio stations. i know cuz i wuz one
of those college radio dj's. god knows how many kids got started in
the scene thru the smart bar in cleveland.

then when metropolis/the church got started in '91. not only were free
passes given away on wruw (case western reserve university's college
radio station). but the promotional scheme wuz to flyer the fuck out
of all the kids coming out of the smart bar. i know cuz i wuz that
kid promoting my ass off for all of mr. forbush's partys back in the
day. this is why i wuz guest listed all the time there, cuz i worked
my ass helping start that club up (before terence became manager, we're
talkin lucci daze).

and when EPT started up (before they became UPS). who wuz the crazy kid
that started up that radical 'zine w/ all those EPT flyers in it & a
rave calendar listing partys thru out the midwest (giving it out for
free w/ money out of his own pocket)? he's speaking to u now. and the
name of the 'zine is that annoying li'l sig @ the end of all my letters.

and when cleveland threw it's biggest party - 420 w/ 4000 kids. it's
becuz one crazy kid went the distance & flyered the fuck out several
major cities. i know cuz i wuz that kid (the rest were shipped off  
to other promotors & record stores - unfortunately not all other 
promotors will go out & pass out yur flyers). being on the net helped
too!

same w/ FAMILY AFFAIR one and two. yur only going to get about 1/4 of
the kids u pass out flyers to, usually. yup there wuz some 12,000 flyers
distributed for those partys.

this is exactly why i fear 720 may be a flop. altho spawntaneous has
been lucky in getting a decent showing for their 'spontaneous' events.
it's becuz they had real good people like mr. cinch & myself doing most
of the legwork for them as far as 'true promotions' (not to be confused
w/ production)...this is exactly why i've been making quite a bit of
last minute road trips to several far off cities to try & save this
party (and sleepy c's ass)...next stop pittsburgh.    

a true promotors job is never done. c'yah @ 720. call my v-mail # below
if u need direx to the party or a crash space.

there's a saying in portuguese, esp. popular in Brazil that goes:  "Vamos 
dar um jeito"...we'll find a way.  Leave it to joe to phenagle creatively...

anayway, as far as college radio promotions, as part of the wpts family 
of networks, i do what i can to promote the scene but try not to overstep 
my bounds.  no one has really come to me with requests...i'm open to 
them, and i'll bet other radio people are as well.  

so promoters, if ya wanna do underwriting, promo spots for events, ticket 
giveaways, mail me, or call the station...648-7990, and if you're talking 
to a promoter who isn't on the net but mentions this, let them know.  
I've mentioned this to people before, but I don't want to push somehing 
without a promoter's permission.

doing what i can b4 i pick up and leave,
steph

Yes indeed. I'd be glad to do more promotions here at WRUW in Cleveland,
if the organizers would get in touch with me. I did a couple last fall
for SANCTUARY and COUP D'ETAT, but haven't heard from anybody since. Promoters
can mail me or call WRUW at (216) 368-2208.

WE AT FREE RADIO PITTSBURGH ARE CURRENTLY OFF THE AIR.

After several months of broadcasting on 90.9FM we accidentally burned out
our primary and secondary transmitter/amps. Therefore we have placed an 
order for parts for repair and if all goes well we should be back on the air the 
week of Aug 1st. Watch the streets and 168 for flyers which will contain programming 
information.

Please be so kind to forward the pb-cle-raves list.

BTW: New this fall, Jungle Radio FM 87.5

In the mean time if you are on the southside give a listen to Radio Carson 88.9 FM.

All dance music all the time.

Back in 92-93 Hanibal and Stickman started work on a Rave Zine.  You 
might want to get their experiences of working on it before you 
start.

I am in support of the idea.  Just need to either 1) get people to 
buy it at low cost (1$) or get advertisers to defray that cost.  WIth 
the scene being so small and way competitive people wither (1) don't 
have the money to spend or (2) do not feel it is necessary to spend 
the $$.  So that is a second hurdle here.

The funniest thingy was at the Irish Center at a Zen event where some 
trippy double dippy fool was whacking the weeny out  in the middle of 
the grassy yard.  Had to be the funniest thing at a Pgh event I ever 
saw.  So you got a good point there...

Missed both of these actually.  Would like to see some of similar 
size or larger.  Need to get this place on the map period.   

Also with the events the costs have been whack.  Like some of the 
recents have gone like up to $25 for a lineup that didn't sparkle my 
eyes.  Then we have the Turkeyz (respect) with the free parties here 
that can't be denied.  A real big contrast.  A one night PGH event is 
worth no more than $15 unless there is some other hitch with it.  The 
big parties running for days elsewhere don't cost much more than $25.
So do consider this you entrepreneurial promoters.

Someone started that idea today on the list.  I am a writer and will 
particpate as my part of the scene.  a hippy dippy eye crunchy zine 
is needed though really.  B&W just really is kinda a downer in this 
day and age.

I just got back n the list actually.  I am glad to see this volume 
increase.  May it continue.

Hope to see everyone tonight at the Turkeyz event.  It should be a 
smoker.

I care about security.   It is an infringement on my personal rights. 
 I mean how many ravers are carrying 9mm handguns and knives and 
using them in this city???

THe only thing that some of us would say is ok is the prevention of 
large drug contraband into an event.  And hey I am pro drug 
anti-stupidity (use yers responsibly).

I can understand security and even smetimes respect the arrangement.  
But I can not respect some gorilla type stuff where they won't let 
you bring yer chained up wallet in and no closed containers and no 
food and no candy.   It is a freakin commercial nightmare.  And I 
imagine no backpacks either.

And all this stuff I have for my own personal entertainment.  I carry 
my notepad for notes, numbers, stories,  reminders, etc.

I carry my notebook PC for comuting items,  to check my mail,  read 
new net pages etc.  

And I am sure they won't let any of it in.

Humerously  a friend who went to  a Starlake AMphitheatre show was 
made to remove his chain from his wallet.  He is about 6 10" and abut 
300 pounds.  as if he needs a punk azz chain as a weapon.  To add to 
the humor the venue was serving Jack and Coke... Like isn't alchol 
like that a big rowdy weapon.

Kill the commercial crap.  It is a shame it has to be like this.  I 
know for one thing that I will not support any show out there until I 
hear some changes in the "security" aka "make sure they have to buy 
our overpriced trash" campaign.

Here are the directions from the infoline for everyone interested in 
the best event happening...  

>From Downtonw Pittsburgh take 279 SOUTH (you will go through the Fort 
Pitt Tunnels, up Greentree Hill,  Past the Carnegie exit,  Past 
Rosslyn Farms exit,  past Campbells Run exit).  Get off the the Route 
22/30 Junction (also marked and known as the way to Starlake 
Amphitheatre).  Make the first right off turn which is a road which 
will be on your left side.   At the stop sign make a right hand turn 
onto Montour Church Road (there will be a BP gas station on your 
right as you do this).  Continue straight on the road until you come 
to the Howard Johnson.  The event will be in the Howard Johnson 
Banquet Hall.

Hope to see you there.

The flyers in the burgh'  have stunk lately.  Just postcard size 
stuff with no color.

And I do not want to step on faces about the design work.  I have 
been down on the Burgh's design forces for a while.

But hopefully this message will send a head shot to everyone and get some 
fresh blook flowing.

I was considering disecting flyers to show where they stole their art 
from and such.  I still might.  Perhaps this would take designing  to a 
new level.

And BTW:  if anyone is interested in a hype original design let me 
know I have a slew of slop ready here and 2 real hardcore artists 
with nice toys to produce things with.  And screw the money stuff  
I want to just get a little thing started and whack the wacked aka a 
freebie for any interested person throwing a certifiable big event. 
(AKA my good deed for the year...) Smiles ;)

See, the only thing I have against zines is that they're so hard to get 
off the ground and maintain.  It would be another straw on a stressed 
camel's back...another project to feed, not necessarily a solution.  And 
it's so expensive, esp if ya wanna do color and semi-glossy covers, etc...

      	(Although this is where the idea of setting up a rave zine "club" at 
	your university might come in handy.  Yeah, mr. nordenberg, we want to 
	express ourselves in an alternative to the alternative to the 
	alternative...  A new wave in journalism...we don't have any kind of 
	hidden agenda at all.  :) :) :))

NOT THAT I'M AT ALL DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM DOING IT!!!  hell, I'm a 
writer too and I love doing design.  I'd contribute.  But I think a good 
supplement is to advertise in established formats, like free 
newsweeklies, a la city ppaer and In Pittsburgh.  Pay somebody a little 
sumptin' and bam, big exposure.

my double nickels on a dime,
steph

I recommend that anyone throwing something down contact Steph for 
some decent aired promos via PTS.  This will reach a bunch of people

Another little something that I noticed about the Pittsburgh events:

At the raves there usually is only one music source with a chill out 
area sometime only.

We need to add or ensure that most events billed as BIG events have 
different generes.   Like jungle in one room and hardcore in another 
room/area.  And then flip to some other stuff.

I went to Snowball back in 92-93 in Columbus and even though it was 
very small (300 people max)  they had killer booths,  a wicked chill 
area,  2 seperate vibes for the peoples moods  some trippy Atari 
2600's on tons of B&W TVs  ... Star WArs playing on these twisty TV's 
for the tripped.

All I am saying is it is cool to have a scene.   But I think we drive 
people away from events.  Like I am a junglist so I probably wont go 
to a hardcore event.  This seems to be the operation of folks here.  

Accordingly,  I am aware that the spaces secured don't really allow 
for different styles.  TZ pulled it at the Irish club with a DJ 
spinning outside but the police did not like that idea very much and 
shut it down outside.

People need to secure more versatile space as well.  Another thing 
the would-be promoter needs to consider.

A big hand clapper for 168's setup on some nights now.  Althought the 
space is small for all you breakin ass windmillers and such.  They 
have two very seperate areas for the head bouncers out here.

I have not been myself out lately to an event.  But just a few ideas 
for all of you.

smack and crack and coke and heroin (i dunno, did i repeat myself?) and
hell...i guess just about every drug i've ever heard of, someone here
has talked about doing on a semi-regular basis...a lot of cool people,

    I agree better promotion is neccessary right now.  But I must admit
some of the best raves I've ever been to I never saw a flyer for.  Word
of mouth is very powerful.  In some cases I would have rather seen b/w
flyers than color so that they could have used the extra money for the
party itself instead of promotions.  However to draw those initial
crowds you need good promoting and interesting promoting.  Originality
is always a plus.  
    I think the local crews should be working on creating some diversity
in their raves.  I'm glad to see alot of talk about promoting lately and
have noticed some new names promoting.  I'm excited to go back to
Pittsburgh next month to see the new things going on as well as to check
out the nearby scenes (Columbus, Philly, DC).  I'm anxious to throw a
few events myself this year.
Peace,

I've been waiting a long time to get to see Mr. Young spin, and he was
even better than everything I've heard about him and by him (the DJ Kicks
CD). I wasn't into the music so much, usual Brillo Pad house, but I've
never seen anyone tear it up and produce the sounds he did out of two
turntables. I never even thought that two turntables and records could
produce some of the insane sounds he made. Unfortunately he didn't start
spinning until 1, and I had to leave to be able to make it to work. I
don't know why they put him on so late when Sparx had 3 hours to spin. By
the time Claude started most people had left the dancefloor. 
One thing that confused me: two guys came up to the turntables where I was
standing to watch. After about 30 sec. they said 'I can't take it anymore'
and left. Where they unable to cope with his mind-numbing speed and tricks
or did they not like the music? I can see how his pulling so many crazy
tricks coule not appeal to some people who are into dancing more than the
music. It does break the flow up and is quite different from the smooth,
seamless style of most DJs. What do other people think? As someone who
spins myself I am more interested in watching the DJ and his style than in
dancing, how do other people react to a style like his?
One rather bizarre mix: Losing control to a track off GU's Atmosfear.
Never would have thought someone could pull that off

I understand no promoter has become rich of the Pittsburgh scene.  
Things seem way too tight.

Some of the reasons:

1) Teens.   What happen to the old crowd (20 somethings).  I got to 
events and I start to feel like someone's father.

2) Lack of respect for the scene.  People do not consider it there 
scene.  In other places everyone knows each other and it is a family 
type thing.  Here the Djs and the groupies are cool but everyone else 
is just there.

Respect to 187 for being the coolest person in the scene.  Joe 
respects everyone and goes way out of his way to make sure everyone 
is alright.

We need more connectivity.  I go out and I do not know who the crew 
is having the party.  I have to ask a  ton of people to find it all 
out.

3)  We need to get some vendor type things for real.  I often want to 
buy some mix tapes,  or maybe a new shirt.  Not just the event stuff 
either.

I dunno really the scene I have been told from out of towner friends 
of mine is pretty cold here believe it or not.  It is not a friendly 
vibe at all.  We have alot of people who are eternally tripped and 
others who just broadcast that they are not happy.

May we improve the scene for what that is worth.  Wroking together is 
what it is all about.

I was there.

Got there slightly after 10pm.  

Everything went fine.  No punks fist fighting this event ;)

The police were nice for stopping by several times to make sure the 
building was still standing. ;)

The first Dj (?)Kevin?? was really kind of nice and sweat and did not try to 
make us all deaf or fall on the floor from BPM exhaustion.  A nice 
start.  Did not catch his name.

Now the imported from NYC Mr. Vestayeo was quite smooth.

We had some nice jungle.  Actually quite a bit of jungle.  Did not 
catch any real nice high endy vocal type things really though...

Then Budda ripped my eardrum sometime well after his midnight timer 
went off.  What was that wack stuff he was playing.  It was speed 
metal.  Really a bad mix for the crowd may I say.  Most of the crowd 
dispersed after his lengthy set.   The set made my azz angry with all 
that noise.  The speaker were overdriven during his set BTW.  Good to 
Joel back.  I just hope he doesn't play so much of that violent 
muzak.  He has skills realy not kicking him,  just not my type of 
music.  Thought it really provokes a violent mood shift with all that 
noise and 800BPM steady.  Well not really 800,  but.

The other Djs were nice  but I seemed to miss alot since I went to 
eat in the middle of the event and I left at about 4am.

All and all it was a nice event.  I missed the smart bar??? Where was 
it??? ANd how about the sideshow person??  Missed him too.

Good vibe.  Could be more friendly.  Good to see 187 jumping around 
with his freakzoid self.   The flyer peeps were plastering cars.  
Respect due.

BTW:  the donation guy came to hit me up at like 4am before I left.  
Collect those monies as we arrive please.  

Big respect up to the Turkey Crew.  Sorry about the bathroom tag 
trash by the punkz.  Wish I would have saw it and put a foot in his 
ass.  

Maybe we should bring some big paper and post it in an area or some 
board and let the freaks decorate it.  And look we have a memorbilla 
for the event.

Oh well someone brief everyone on the Djs better than I have.

Peace.

Subject: Tribute is the Last Free Party...
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com

Thank you to all who came out to Tribute - The Jive Turkeyz Last Event

Why is it our last event. Because of lack of respect for the Immaculate
space that we had. The damage done to our space last night is going to cost
me at least $800(Money that I do not have) These are FREE parties that I
did out of the love for this scene. Instead I got shit on by everyone and
their mother.

1st problem we had was mother fucking scribblers... If I find the guy who
did that shit I'm gonna take your FUCKING CRAYOLAS and shove them up your
ass. We had 3 tags in the bathroom, not 15 minutes after the party started.

2nd the asshole that decided it would be a good idea to throw popcorn
kernels all over the dance floor and spill half of the popcorn in the
kitchen which I almost broke my neck when I fell on them.

3rd the genius who broke into the bar and decided to steal half of the
hotels alcohol. They broke into a cooler by prying it open thus damaging
the cooler itself($100). Then they broke into the pool area bar and tapped
out the keg($70) plus they broke a tap for the Keg in the Bar area thus
making it so the hotel can no longer serve drinks in that area($100).

4th another asshole that broke into a storage room in the back of the hotel
and took more beer and whatever($150).

5th whoever decided to kick in the vent on the dance floor which I was able
to repair myself.

There were other things that fucking pissed me off but I'm too tired to
even think about that rite now.

If anyone has any clue who may have caused this damage, please report it to
me as soon as possible.

Thank you to all those who respected the space and had a good time. Others
that caused problems can go TO HELL!!!

The last party I went to was one week ago to the day, if I'm not 
mistaken.  This party did not have a name.  There were no fliers for this 
party.  There was an info-line, and several hundred incredibly 
enthusiastic New Hampshire ragers.  There were awesome sounds, and by far 
the best vibe I've ever experienced.
While wacky promotion is certainly entertaining, and probably will draw 
huge amounts of people to events, the value of small events must not be 
overlooked.  I'll take a 200-person party in an old dusty warehouse over 
a 4000-person party in an arena any day.
There are enough huge-ass events out there.  There are enough 25 dollar 
admissions, there are enough 2 hour lines to get in, there are enough 
idiot security jerks throwing kids out of parties for things they should 
have the right to do if they so desire.  There are enough production 
companies who don't know what's up, and try to throw "The BIGGEST event 
EVER" and then it ends up getting busted, and you are _not_ going to see 
your 25 bucks ever again.  There are enough trendy mainstream 
fashion-show raves, and enough trendy mainstream fashion-show ravers.
Keep the underground spirit alive.
Keep the 200-person parties going.
Keep up the free parties.
Keep on breaking into warehouses.
Keep on presenting truly underground music.
Keep the family going!

This makes me fucking sick.  The fact that any fucking asshole would do 
shit like this makes it painfully obvious that there are people who are 
into this scene who have absolutely no right being in it.  Stickman, 
these parties you've been throwing are what it's all about, and you have 
all of my respect.
There are always going to be assholes in this culture.  We seriously need 
to try to weed these assholes out the best we can.  I really don't know 
what we can do, other than maybe do what New England Works does:  Make it 
fairly difficult for people to find the party.  DSP was telling me 
yesterday about how for this one NEW party, all the info line said was this:
"We're sorry that we can't really tell you where the party is being 
held...  Try harder!"  The party drew several hundred.  Maybe we need 
more map-points, more stuff to make it so it's more difficult and takes 
longer to actually get to the party... That way, only the people who 
_really_ want to be there will be there.  Hahah imagine a map-point set 
up like this:  The people setting up the party print out two sets of 
directions to the party, one that leads to the party, and one that leads, 
say, the the police station.  All of the obvious idiots who show up at 
the map point get, you guessed it, the directions to the police station.
So anyways, good luck finding the idiots who messed shit up for you and 
everyone else.  And thanks much for the contribution you've made!
*Props!*

Heres my review of the party called Tribute ...

Left NYC @ like 3:30pm to drive to western MA wit my moms to pick up my
car ... i got there @ like 6pm, decide i wanna go to pittsburgh, go print
out the directions to tribute and hit the road ... go like 85-90 when i
can, hit the Flying J in Harrisburgh (1.199 for 92 Octane ... kick ass
;) and arrive in pittsburgh @ 2am. Get to the site just as Deadly Buda's 
beginin his set.

The Music:
Deadly Buda ... nice, but not hard enough ... he played three or four
hard tracks @ the end, but alot of the stuff was just too happy. Mind u,
Happy
Hardcore is one of my fav's, but it wasn't exactly HH, more like
GabbaLite ;) hhehe ... but it was nice to hear the stuff he played @ the
end ...

Eric Justin ... bahh House ... But he played Energy Flash @ the end and
it was all good ;)

Atomic Bob ... some nice goa sounding stuff @ the beginnin' but then
some hard acid/trance ... after that i left

'tween grooving to the music, and going to the bathroom to refill my
bottle, I ran into Countzero, Proby, Hannible and 187 ... 

BTW did the net meet happen? Is there a Net meet for 720? Anyone have
directions to 720 or the jungle party in Bmore?

Oh well ... it was worth the drive, though I am pissed cause I missed
Jordan Vesteyo, who i heard spin last weekend @ Destiny 15 and who i was 
looking forward to hearing ... oh well it will just teach me to make 
plans earliar next time.

I still haven't decided between the jungle party in bmore or 720. But i
will prolly hit 720, since its closer and i don't like to drive ;) 

hehe

Ok, first of all, that subject header is _NOT_ a reference to the vitamin
that so many of us love to partake of at these rave event thingies, so don't
take it that way.  Second of all, as you can see from Rick's post titled no
more free parties, there were some VERY negative aspects to the deadly buda
tribute that went down in Pittsburgh late last night. However, the thing
that Rick failed to mention, and understandably so, was that regardless of
the STUPID ASS SHIT that motherfuckers deemed necessary to perpetrate
against the nice Howard Johnson's people, this party DID fucking ROCK shit
down, and almost everybody I know that was there had an incredible fucking
time. :) That being said, lets do a rundown shall we?
8:30ish head to Steph Alarcon's place for a pre-party hanging out thang. (HI
Steph! :)  Went dahn Oakland anat, chilling at the Primanti Bros. with a
beer and a sandwich.  Had some nice chit chat :D Anyway, so then we go to
meet Marcus (Proby) and as USUAL my homeboy is LATE :P Well, no biggie,
we're on our way oot soon enough and make it to the HOJO's down the road
soon enough.  When we went in, the one thing I noticed was the INCREDIBLE
sound.  Rick went out of his way to get some AWESOME sound for this party,
and hell, you figure with the lineup we had (Timestretch, Jordan Vesteyo,
the return of Deadly Buda, not to mention the solid local talent) this place
was going to NEED it.  Well, the sound remained SLAMMIN the entire night.
Loki was spinning some hard techno, throwing in a little bit of the
progressive trance flava at the end of his set. After him, Eric Davenport
(not the one from LA) went on, and spun a set of slow breaks that to my ears
seemed a little less than inspired, and some of the mixes seemed a litttle
shaky, but his track selection was nice, and it was the right time for the
warm up that slow breaks provided.  Then to my amazement (and his too i
think) Timestretch went on at about 12:30 with his "straight from the U.K.
by way of Boston" dubplate selected junglist sound his "choons" (is that
what they call them these days?) were absolutely choice and his mixing was
swell.  Pittsburgh loves jungle, so everybody seemed happy.  Oh, btw, I
forgot, I think the original tagging incident (FUCKERS!) happened sometime
during Loki's set, and the problem from my perspective was that security on
the way into the venue BEFORE the incident was pretty lax (sp.?) and so
mofos who had markers and shit could bring them in.  Anyway, Timestretch
finished his extremely nice set and handed over the decks to who other than
Jordan Vesteyo, and damnit if he didn't just kick our asses _all_ over the
place.  By the end of his set, which was taking a turn for the gabber-esque
;) I kept thinking to myself how proud Pezboy would be if he had been there
to hear Jordan's hard ACID sounds... they were nice and kept me jumping up
and down and up and down... THEN, well, basically, the place went COMPLETELY
nutso balls out messed up and jamming when none other than the "founding
father of the pittsburgh rave scene" deadly buda took the decks.  Well, I
heard him a coupla times back when I first started going to parties in '94
(I can't believe it has only been two years and a monthsince i started all
this craziness!!!)  but never really knew back then just what or who I was
hearing.  But, I have a tape form his glory days, so I KINDA knew what to
expect.  Surprisingly enough (?) he played a set _very_ similar to one he
would have played had it been '93 or '94.  I wonder if he has been playing
the same kind of sets since then in Colorado or wherever he has been.
Regardless, I loved it and the crowd friggin LOVED it. It just ROCKED to
hear all these wacked out old "classics?"  which i think they could be
considered... Anyway, for MOST of his set, the dance floor was filled to
capacity (for the size of the party) and everyone was throing hands in the
air and whistling and stuff.  (Oh which everyone was also doing for
Timestretch and Jordan Vesteyo btw) Anyway, so Deadly Buda played all kinds
of messed up stuff, and as that 6 million ways to die intro proved, he did
it _HIS WAY_ and also he threw in a little mister rogers, thus making him
_MY_ kind of DJ!!! :D So, Marcus (a very very very very sleep needing
Marcus) and I left right after his set so I could get home to the house i
virtually snuck out of the night before.  I dropped him off at his boon dock
place and zoomed home. Damn, that was one FINE night of dancing.  Now, just
to make a quick comment on tagging... IT FUCKING SUCKS and anybody who would
do it at a party is a complete imbicile and a moron, unfortunately the
people who would are most likely not on this list... Alas... I'd like to
extend a super special thanks and most wholehearted expression of gratitude
and respect to the boys like Rick Worth and Joe 187 for doing what they did
and will continue to do (be it free or not) for the scene in Pittsburgh.
You guys are the best.  Thank you thank you thank you.  It really sucks that
everytime Rick tries to do something wonderful, something goes wrong to
spoil it.  :( Anywa, Rick, please dn't lose all faith inthe scene, remember
what you _HAVE_ accomplished and not what you may have not accomplished, and
also, none of the bad shit is your fault (duh) so don't make it harder on
yourself than it should be.  Anyway, to sum up, anybody that was within 3
hours of Pittsburgh last night and DIDN'T come to this party was a COMPLETE
imbecile, thus, my sneaking out of the house, and thus so many wonderful
ohio faces! (Hi Jeff! Hi Mary! Hi Stevie!) _And_ a super big thank you to
Joel, Ian, and Jordan for making treks and playing recs.  You guys are the
shit.  Oh, and one final word to all the super cuties out there, you know
who you are because I'm sure I told you about it! ;)  ok, later -Count Zer0

There has not been a proper chill out room (or for that matter, there hasn't
been a proper second room of any kind) at a Pittsburgh party since All
Natural.  If there has, I missed it and would somebody please remind me of
the party there was a second room at? 

And, on that note, and for nothing but completely selfish reasons, I
strongly urge promoters in Pittsburgh to bring back the chill out room. I am
more than ready willing, and able to spin extended chill out sets in a
properly setup chill out room.  Plus, with my upcoming expansion of dj
services, (hehe) I am going to start playing real music too ;P In other
words, I've learned to beatmatch! ;) Hehehehe, anyway, promoters, get in
touch with me, I'm a nice guy who plays some decent "ambeint" esque music.
Plus (flashes fliers for Mosaic (Bmore) Cloudwatch(Bmore), Active Not
Passive(Columbus), Lost City(Bmore), and Quantum Bass(Erie)) other cities
have been booking me, so Pittsburgh should too! ;) heheheheheheheh hehehehe
anyway, I'd love to see a chill room in Pittsburgh even if I am never a part
of it! :D So, do something promoters, open your events to a diffferent crowd

Yo,  Rick.  I was there last night.  I was watching out.  I tell you 
we got some sneaks out there.  I am not pointing any fingers but we 
all have some ideas who the bar freaks were.   I was looking out all 
night for you.  Like one drunk idiot went outside and wanted to fight 
with some other punk.  So I squashed the shit.  I didn't catch the 
scribbler(s) wanted to so I could write all over his face.

I missed the popcorn completely.  Sorry you fell though still.

This is wacked.  I had been in the bar earlier in the evening.  I 
find it amazing that this happened since (1) one security guy was 
posted in the hallway for a good bit after 2am until I left at 4am 
directing people to move from the hallway into the event or into the 
bathroom.

I know there was one drunk fool who was mad the bartender shut him 
off.  His buddy I did not see at all later in the night as neither 
did I.  ANd there were these two juveniles who were hanging at the 
corner of the bar and the payphones all evening.Very possibly your candidates 
for fingerprinting and lyching.

I would say it is the same person or part of his group of upto 7 
people he came with.

Well the vent.  I expected one of the chandelieres to come down since 
some monkey asses felt it would be cool to swing from em.  Saw the 
shit like 5 times and told the fools about it.

I had a real good time.  Sorry shit went so bezerk.  I feel I did 
more than my part with helping out crowd controlage.  I guess an 
admission to the event would prevent alot of this silly stuff since 
the kid mentality people probably would not put out the money for an 
event.

Alot of the people there seemed really young (13-17).  Where did all 
the people 20something go.  I know they were here 2 years ago.

The people in the scene here are pretty sad and I saw that evident 
moreso last night than ever with all the destruction and kid azz shit 
they were spewing out.

Shame on the fools.

Well if you think I'm going to stop throwing parties... THINK AGAIN!!!!
Hell no I ain't I love the music, the people, the energy, everything that
makes a rave true. To be a rave promoter or a promoter of any sort for that
matter, you must be a crazy mutha' fucker. I get shit on daily from people
that either don't enjoy my parties, don't like raves, or are just jealous
that they can't do what I'm doing. But I will and have been since '93, wipe
the shit off and keep promoting, because I am headstrong. Tribute was 90%
successful and about 10% of it was for shit. But already I am forgetting
the shit and remembering what a great time I had at that event. However
that free party was a doorway for FUEL Parties to increase as well, the
owner and I had an agreement that if that one went over well(Which it did n
ot) He would work with me and we would do it monthly, oh well, I guess the
lack of appreciation and respect has caused for there to be another decreas
e in the amount of parties around here. We ain't gettin' that space again.
Hell I may even get fined by the township of robinson for vandalism.   I
hate the lack of respect however and something must be done about it.

OH WELL I'll keep promoting and throwing parties but they sure as hell
aren't going to be Free.

Damn... this is the first I've read my email since um, Thursday night, I 
guess, and just reading the message from Rick really really upset me... I 
mean, I can understand his being upset.  People these days are just 
totally forgetting what "raving" is all about... why the fuck would you 
go to a party just to steal beer/alcohol and break into things that don't 
belong to you?  And to tag... need I say more?  That shit's just fucking 
bogus.  (Pardon my language, everyone).  

All I can say (besides all the shit I could say about the assholes who 
messed things up for everyone else in the future) is that _I personally_ 
(and I know a LOT LOT LOT of others feel the same way)  think that 
Tribute was just absolutely overwhelmingly fucking da bomb!  The space 
was awesome, the lineup was spectacular, and in short, the whole party 
was just awesome... it just sucks that while there was so much positive 
energy flowing, that there were such asshole shitting on us by screwing 
us over.  :(  

But Rick, as Nick said earlier, You truly deserve massive props... I 
think the party was awesome... I don't think I've seen so many people 
just go absolutely NUTS as when Buda came on... he was so awesome I got 
goosebumps (ask Frank!!!)... and Timestretch... wowee... need I say 
more?  :)  As well as everyone else... And the hard acid that was played 
that night... Oh my god!!!  oh my god oh my god oh my god!  You couldn't 
even imagine how insane I was going... It was excellent.  

I think I'm babbling (it's 2 in the morning...), so I should probably 
stop posting... I think that more people are just in need of respect for 
the scene... I don't think a lot of ravers out there don't have the 
respect for the scene that we have... and they need to get it, and 
fucking NOW!  So, in short, Rick, you're awesome... the party rocked the 
house (hee hee... and figuratively AND literally  ;)  , and um, I guess 
that's all... sorry I'm kinda bein' grumpy, but I hope all of you 
understand where the hostility is coming from... Imagine going to one of 
the BEST parties in your town/city at a spot that would be AWESOME, and 
then having dicks make it so you can't go there anymore.  It pretty much 
fucking sucks.  But at the same time, I'm still recovering from afterglow 
of the party.  ;)  hee hee.

Everyone take care and be happy and smile!  :)

Alrighty everyone.  I went to Tribute and as pomised I picked up all 
the flyers I found there and scanned them in.

I am going to transfer the scans over to HYPERREAL right now and the 
maintainer there said he already has a section for flyers and will 
add them so check them out.

The scans include:

a pre - flyer flyer for Quantum in Erie, PA (september)
Elite - a sider for a near event by the Sunshine Kids Pgh,pa
2 sider for Vision of Rythm - July 26 Pgh, PA - n'sync productions
and all the parts for the Enit Festival at Starlake - August 15.

------------------------

I am going to setup a automailer for all the event scans that you 
will all be able to send mail to and get the flyers you want when you 
want them for your at home viewing experience.

Let me know what you think about the scans and the mailing idea.

I will post more probably today on the mailing information.

-P.

Brief, Brief, Brief...

I dont think he meant it that way.  But he does have a point:  There are 
too many people going to raves with the sole purpose of frying their 
neurons.  True, some drugs have the potential to awaken the human mind, 
but the people he was talking about beam up to escape.  They're the kind 
of people who give raves a bad name.  You have to wonder what they're 
escaping from.

He's just worried about the scene.  I'm a bit concerned, myself.  I met a 
girl at Tribute who had enough juice on here to cook your headware.  She 
definitly wasn't there to bask in the energy from the Deadly One.  I 
don't know.

I've only made it to Saturday night (at least so far), and I'm still
exhausted, so I'll be brief: the Agora is the Agora, the place we've all
grown to know and hate as it is just not a place whose layout lends itself
to parties. The House room - I love Chicago house, I liked most of what I
heard, especially Boo Williams, but its not what I wanted to hear for a
party, I personally prefer more energetic techno, so I wasn't in this room
much.
the techno room - the sound was terrible for most of the night, I liked
most of the music but at times had to leave due to the sound. when the
bass would get low and loud the speakers sounded like they were almost
blown. high points - Nigel Richards was incredible, he even made the sound
system sound almost decent. The one before Nigel (was it Oliver from Steel
City Records?) was good too, I like a lot of his tracks but the heavy kick
drum beats just did not sound good on those speakers.
The real high point for me - the Jungle alley. I'm normally not terribly
excited by jungle, I like it, but its not what I'd choose to hear at a
party. But I spent most of the night in the alley. It was the only place
where there was any sort of vibe. Plus it was nice to get outside where it
wasn't disgustingly hot and smokey.
All in all wasn't great, but came off better than I had expected. I had
barely slept the night before so I had no energy. It had a LOT of
potential to have been an incredible party if all the little things had
been worked out.

That would also keep away people like myself who decided Friday afternoon
that he wanted to drive the four hours each way to check out one of steel
city's parties.  I don't like the larger parties (500+ people) too much,
and I had a great time there dancing my ass off, which I don't get to do
very often.  I know people like myself are few and far between, so maybe
it would be okay.  I am not trying to change anyone's mind, just providing
a little food for thought.

It cracked me up the kiddies at Tribute.  Some little girly thinking 
she slick blurped out that there was not any X but some 'CID if the 
friend wanted some.  As if the CID term was so covert.

I was in the bathroom and some sucka had a big ass baggy of I believe 
some ole cocaine type stuff.  

Really messy people all out in the open about stuff.

And the worst of all drugs- the alchol was in effect.  Some little 
girl had a bottle she must have took from her parents liquor cabinet 
in her purse.

Really a big set of messed up people beneath my age group (i.e. 20 
somethings).

Seems the young uns'  just want a brain zoomer.

Really wish they would keep it private and perhaps use their 
recreational favorites before the events.

This is an absolute SHAME.  I of course had no knowledge of this, as I 
just got back from driving back from Pittsburgh to Boston (was without 
net access for a couple of days...)

This is INCREDIBLY disheartening.  The Jive Turkeys, in my honest 
opinion, threw the BEST PARTY that I have been to in TWO YEARSon Friday, 
and may I add, for absolutely FREE, and this is the respect that the 
scene gives them?  This makes me sick.  There was a LOT of down to the 
wire planning for this event which went off, and I am really upset that 
something like this has to happen.  The Howard Johnson's motel was 
incredibly gracious to let us have that space for FREE, and now this has 
to happen.  I can't believe it.  In fact I'm disgusted.  

I had the time of my life at TRIBUTE.  The old skool Pittsburgh crew 
represented for the grandaddy himself, and this is the thanks they get?  
SICK.  Yes, I have been away from Pittsburgh for a while (because o' 
school) and I there are a lot of new faces, but this is the first time 
that anything to this magnitude has happened in our city and it must be 
stopped.  I thought that the tagging in the mens room was quite out of 
hand, as well was the disrespectful people in the main lobby causing a 
commotion for the staff, but as far as I knew, these were remedies by the 
time I left.. all of this new information is new to me.  

Now I'm sure that none of the pb-cle raves or ne-raves were responsible 
for these problems, but hey, Stickman needs some help here.  He has put a 
lot of hard work in to throwing that party, and there is a definate call 
for some help.  $800 dollars in damages is nothing to laugh at-- this is 
serious.  If anyone sees Rick in Pittsburgh and can spare a couple of 
bucks to help him out in fixing the financial damages, I'm sure he'd be 
very grateful...

man, I just don't know what else to say.  this is just really wrong.  
really wrong...

Well well well, let's for a brief moment disregard the fact that a lot of 
disrespectful and evil things happened at Tribute.  Now let me offer you 
my review of the party in GENERAL...

Two words: FUCKING INCREDIBLE.  One word (and this is for Rick): NIM!!!!!

Ok ok ok... Let's see.  Let me begin by saying that there was NO WAY IN 
HELL that I was going to miss out on this mo fo, and that I am thankful 
to my wonderful bloke of a roomate Ian, the man like the Timestretch, for 
coming down with me with his company and, of course, his rekkids...  
Secondly, let me give eternal props to Rick, the Turkey with the most 
Jive for pulling this one off, albeit yet another money pit.  This party 
ROCKED THE MOTHAFUKKIN CASBAH!  Don't let the arseholes who ruined the 
hotel get to you, your parties are still and have always been the bomb 
and I know that you have your heart in the right place, my man...

Read on...

Okay, so Ian and I pump up and jet (heh heh rick) the Acura out of Boston 
town for the 12 hour journey to Pittsburgh, my beloved hometown.  The 
ride was smooth and easy, believe it or not.   Rolled to the man like 
Opus' house to pick him and Jess/Mommy up, then off to Tom Butcher's 
house to snag him... (BTW: it was GREAT to see you again... you're one 
funny mo 'fro...)

Then, THE PARTY... 

VAN DAMME the space was great.  Of course, not for long, but hey, read 
on.  The sound was INCREDIBLE!We arrived during Eric Davenport's set (which 
was unfortunate for me, because I wanted to see Glen/Loki throw down)
 but HEY.. He was pretty decent, I suppose.  The kids by now had some 
groove in their bootys...

After him, TIMESTRETCH of the world famous Jungle Roots representing 
straight out of Boston "buttfucked" it up (heh heh) with an incredible 
set of the drum and bass, along with a few choice phrases by MC SPHINX
 (great to finally meet you, Hossam...)  The jungle jam session whooped the
Spotted Monkey's ass!!  Pittsburgh's lighter and whistle massive were NOT
denied!  A VERY incredible sophmore appearance from the Timestretch-- 
make sure to check him out at the REWIND next month!

JORDAN VESTEYO then took control with an insane set of hard acid that 
was damn fine, but I have to admit that through most of his set I was 
talking to friends that I haven't seen in ages and really couldn't pay 
much attention to it... but THEN...after Jordan finished up, it was back 
to the floor for what I was waiting for...

*DEADLY BUDA*

>From the moment he dropped the needle on the fundamentalist Christian 
preacher record which said that rock and roll was the music of the dark 
lord Satan :)  I knew that I was in for the ride of my life. BUDA BUDA! 
the second record screamed, and the dance floor burst into flames!  The 
crowd SCREAMED for Joel, like the disco call (more on that later), and I 
quote;

Senders: "DEADLY!"
Responders: "BUDA!"

I couldn't believe it.  Here he was, back for the first time in two 
years, and EVERYONE and their MOM was going ballistic!  He began his 
two-hour journey into hardcore with the DEVESTATINGLY SICK classics from 
'92 and '93... This is the Pittsburgh I grew up with.  For his set, the 
TURBO - ZEN family was officially re-instated.  Rick and I had to be 
careful not to trip over our toungues as we stomped our way through such 
anthems as Altern-8's "Frequency", T-Bone Castro's "9 is a Classic", Aphex 
Twin's remix of Mescalinium United's "We Are United" and Alec Empire's
"Suicide" EP (LET THE SUN SHINE!! LET THE SUN SHINE IN!!!)  We laughed, we
cried, we stomped, we smiled the entire way through.  

Buda then proceeded to dabble with some happy hardcore, some Mr. Rogers 
(what could be better for a Pittsburgh party?!?), and some evil wildstyle 
banging, twisting and churning hardcore that turned the crowd's legs into 
one collective bloody mess..  (Including two of his tracks released on 
FUCKEM Germany) It was SICK, I tell you, SICK!!  He blew me away, as he always
has been since I first saw him at PowerRave.  NEXT STOP, BOULDER!


And what amazed me the most, the crowds response--- they LOVED every 
second of it.  Well, the majority of them, mind you.  One-style-only 
liking individuals, the only-there-for-the-pills crew and the bastards 
stealing the beer might have been up to their usual antics, but NEW and 
OLD faces alike all were getting down to his set-- at the very least 
amazed by the strange and unusual beats being launched from the Klipsch 
speakers-- (all old hat to some of us though...tee hee!!)  I could go on 
and on about his set, but I'll spare my typing fingers some pain here... :P

Anyway, the rest of the night was great-- even though me and the crew 
took off to the Eat 'n Park halfway through Eric Justin's set (he's still 
X-on to me!!!!) because they were hungry... grrr..  I wanted to stay, but 
I know that Atomic Bob and Kevin (Pittsburgh's mixing prodigy) tore some 
serious shiznit up after I left...

In short, the party was INCREDIBLE.  The vibe was as thick as the kids 
that tagged/stole/broke things in the hotel's skulls!  And 'nuff said on 
that!

And now, the shouts:  

Rick! (my ace in the hole... keep your spirits up.  You've been 
delivering the goods since you, Scott and I threw Simplicity!  'Nuff 
said!  an AMAZING party which will take a lot to top in my books-- 
CONGRATULATIONS on Tribute!! biiiiiiiiiiiiiig up..), Ian (in countless 
ways, thanks), Opus (thanx for letting us crash and letting my blow your 
ass out of the water playing cards), Damian (much respect from Mr. Warm 
Milk-- and take that spike out of your roomates skull, hoss), Jess 
(thanks for keeping me awake until 5:30 am Sunday.. hahah), Eric (sorry 
that I forgot to do a Randy Savage.. excellent to see you, albeit 
briefly), Frank (thank god you 'escaped', eh?),Bob (keep josh in check!), 
Tom (excellent to see you and thanks 
for chillin' at the e'np with us), Christy and Amy (I wuv you both), Ben 
(wadfamchocksot?) and of course Mr. Joel Bevacqua, the evil wildstyle 
messiah... THANK YOU.  .. and to the Pittsburgh massive kids out there 
who STILL WANT TO KEEP IT *REAL*, I give you neverending RESPECT and 
FAITH... SEE?!  PITTSBURGH STILL KNOWS HOW TO ROCK!

Ok.  Enough said.  Must sleep now!
See you all at INFINITY, hopefully... possibly the rewind?!?

As I have stated before via this list,  it is sickening the childish 
mentality of alot of the PGH "ravers" who showed at Tribute.  I had 
never seen most of them.   It was a pack of thievery and destruction 
no joke.  I know someone had their pager stolen/lost and no one 
coughed it up as well as all the damages we have gone over.
It is disheartening.  And I guarantee the stuff will not occur again. 
Cause I will be there with my boots in the asses folks.

Don't crap on my scene or you just might need to get a neck sizing 
done.

The event was one of the better ones I have been to period.  Although 
we didn't have trippy dippy gfx, lights, lasers, drinkage, candies 
etc.  it was a comfortable environment with enough space.  I could 
actually breath in there.  

Everyone got their dance off , breakers included without incident.

I am going to give Rick a ring.  Patch things up over the money he 
needs there and see what I can do to prevent any legal liability on 
his or anyone elses part.

>

> really wrong...

There is not uch we can say except some stuff is definitely going to 
change.  Including door policy checks,  no free admission,  rejection 
of certain shady people for whatever reasons deemed proper etc.

The promoter is responsible unfortunately for idiots actions and as 
such he/she can use their discretion and disallow anyone entrance to 
an event.  This is something these kids need to remember.

Hopefully I will be a vital part of cleaning up this dirty scene.

But hey everyone don't forget,  there are a few of us left out here 
that have been here since the scene started.  I remember going to a 
RAVE that Budda threw with some guy from England(?)  a red hair 
bearded guy-  who spun some insane stuff back in like 91-92 out in 
North Hills.  It was one of the earliest events in the burgh'.  I was 
at PowerRave. I know there are some of you that perhaps even go back 
further than this (187)...  We will remain I am sure.  This is not a 
pubescent trip for us but a way of life.

HARDCORE 100% FOREVA.  Do not forget it.  We will overcome this 
together or we will cease to exist together.

-Peace or pieces- you choose.

Well, I just back from the Sunday party and I'd actually have to say it
was one of the best Cleveland parties I've ever been to. It was just in
the theater (one stage), and it wasn't crowded at all, there was just the
right number of people for me, probably about 200 (though I'm not good at
guessing numbers).
We got there about 11:30, the music started at 11, there was maybe 30-40
people there and Sammy was tearing the floor up. I've seen the name on
fliers before, but I don't remember ever hearing him spin, but this was
one of the only sets in recent memory that I was blown away by (btw- does
anyone know where he's from?). The 6 or so people on the floor were having
a grand old time and were all running and jumping all over the place,
which I promptly joined in.
More people kept coming in until 3 or 4. Don't know who was after Sammy,
the one after that guy I think was Terry Mullan, that's who someone told
me he was, and I've never seen Terry spin before although heard much. But
anyway he was playing HARDCORE!!! I thought it was great fun, though most
of the crowd didn't seem to take to it right away, understandable as it
was the third night of partying. But gradually the DJ got everyone moving
and did a great set. The next guy I also don't know, and he continued the
hardcore-mood playing some hardish Chicago stuff (eg Hyperactive records,
and Flash). Also a great set. After this they started in with jungle,
which I wasn't in the mood for as I'd gone for a couple days with little
or no sleep.
Given that I was well passed the point of exhaustion it is fairly
impressive that the DJs kept me dancing almost all night. This is how I
like parties - reminded me of Detroit a little - small, hard music, and
friendly faces.

I really hate this terminology.  It implies that drugs damange brain
cells.  With the exception of crystal and very high doses of E (and
of course, alcohol), there is no evidence to back up such implications.

>True, some drugs have the potential to awaken the human mind,

I think you've watched one too many Partnership for a Drug Free
America ads.  I have only met one person (a nonraver) who does
drugs to escape.   All the ravers I have met either say they do
it because it enhances the experience or because they like it,
i.e. it makes them feel good.  These reasons, IMNSHO, are more
valid than the BS about it "awaken[ing] the human mind".  If you
really want to awaken your mind, I would go to the library, not
the drug dealer down the road.  Sure, some drugs may change your
perspective on life (and I will not dispute this).  But to claim
that this is the *only* valid reason for consuming is short sighted
and sounds very much like a personal way of justifying it.

Why?  Because they don't fit into your narrow reasons for getting
high?  

>You have to wonder what they're

Like I said, I doubt they're escaping.

okay.

i guess i am gonna sound like some sort of drug-loving hedonist wack-o, 
but i am on a legalization binge at the moment, so i have to say this.

no flame intended, ms. talley, but i *HATEHATEHATEHATEHATE* people who 
say "I stopped doing drugs because i saw a lot of kids doing them," or "I 
stopped doing drugs because i saw other people abusing them." That is the 
lamest of representations. Follow the logic here.

Let's say I have a friend who ate chocolate all the time, and then one 
time, ate too much, and threw up all over his girlfriend. Now *I* will 
never eat chocolate again? But I have always liked chocolate... I love 
the way it tastes, and it really calms my nerves... 

Now, in fairness, lets say i have a friend, and i see him take a hammer, 
and start pounding on one of his toes. it *really* seems to cause him a 
lot of pain. So is it fair if i make a mental note: "Don't pound one's 
own toes with hammer, it hurts?" of course.

the difference here is that the first was something I had tried, and 
formed an opinion of for myself. the latter was something I had never 
tried, but judging from icarious experience decided that it wouldn't be 
somethinfg I was interested in.

If *you* have had good experiences on drugs, and then see others have 
bad, and decide it isn't worth the risk, well, okay. it's your 
perogative. But to say "I used to do ecstacy, but then i saw a 15 year 
old who was strung out on crystal, so i do no drugs anymore..." it seems 
to me you quit drugs because of... association? as in: other people 
associate drugs with cracked out 15 yr-olds who need a good spanking and 
perhaps a bath, so i am not going to do them...?

i dunno... just some thoughts. but if you don't want to do drugs because 
you are afraid of losing control of yourself, or having a bad experience, 
then say "I am afraid of what drugs might do to me."

The Jive Turkeyz were a beautiful thing.  Sincere to the real spirit, 
good people, the kind who give you a hug from the second time they meet 
you.  In the best of all possible worlds, the turkeyz stick around to 
"debug the scene" and remind us what it's all about.  

But it's not the best of all possible worlds--and I so, so, so much want 
to mention names but I'm not gonna--but anyway there are some shady ass 
muthafuckers in this scene making it harder for everybody else.  
Squabbles about money and secrecy and fucking POLITICS are driving me 
crazy.  I thought this was something to turn to when you're disgusted 
with the rest of the music industry, an oasis of idealism in a world of 
marketing and fakes.

I was starting to forget a little bit why I always looked at this scene 
with wonder and affection, even before I ventured into it.  It came back 
to me the other night, this feeling of admiration for a group of young 
people that the general population has no faith in, turning things 
around for themselves and their friends and the people they believe in.

I also felt grateful that I was so lucky, that I could be somehow in on 
this unique form of entertainment, unlike anything I'd ever experienced 
before, and so often so beautiful, so progressive, a wave of the future, 
a shadow of the past.  

And the people...sunshine, lollipops and rainbows...didn't take me long 
to feel moderately comfy.  Smiles and hugs, skills and ideas.

This was the ideal I fell in love with.  And I still see bits of it, like 
in Stickman's smirk when he's planning a party.  and unfortuneatley, he 
has been royally shat upon.  And this royally sucks.  Nice to know so 
many people's hard work and love can get crushed by a couple of 
undersexed egotists.  Nice to know ppl know what 'respect' 
means...respect for themselves and the people who are trying to do 
somehting great for all of us.

In the best of all possbile worlds...I hoped this was one of the best of 
all probably worlds...

Stickman, you did a good job and put on a great event, as the Jive 
turkeyz have been doing all summer.  I wish things had actually worked 
out, but I'll offer you more than just a stinking 2 cents next 
time I see you.  

respect to the turkeyz, all the cool promoters, all the skilled djs, and all 
the plurry ravers, not to mention the howard johnson's ppl who 
apparenlty put more faith in this scene than it deserves,

In what way are these "kids" messed up?  This really helps in determining
cause and effect.  IMO and from my experience, drug abuse is usually an 
effect and not a cause.

>& how they only seem to party 
>for the purpose of their drugs.  

So?  Why is that so bad?

>which makes me sick as hell because *i*

I wonder if you make them sick because *you* go for the *music*.
I tend to doubt it.  I really hate this hollier-than-thou attitude.
Why is your reason more valid than their reason?  Do you really think 
it is?

What the hell happened to tolerance?  I have probably said this before
(and I'm going to say it again).  People go to raves for a variety of
reasons.  Some go for the music; some go to dance; some go for drugs;
some go for fashion; some go for socializing; some for tolerance and
acceptance; and others go for any combination of these things.  *All*
of them are valid.  I don't want someone telling me how to have fun
and I don't tell others.  I think it is arrogant and ignorant to think
that only *you* know the correct way of enjoying yourself.  

>what an ODD CONCEPT =p

Not really.  But it is not the only concept.

True the cause of the problems usually is some deep rooted real 
thing.

Why is it so bad?

Let me see...  Have you ever been downtown and had a begger ask you 
for money?  And he followed you and kept it up and kept it up just 
trying to give you a guilt trip for no apparent good reason really.
 
Why is it so bad?  Because they are nagging a whole lot of them.  
They are a liability waiting to happen.  Experimental sorts who at an 
age not old enough to vote try to explain to me that I don't know 
nothing'.  A holier and drugier than thou crowd.

See I am pro drug.  I am pro suicide.  .  Anti- Death 
penalty. Pro freedom.

The effects of drug use are evident in most users of drugs.  
Recreational use of pure untainted,  undiluted,  uncontaminated 
druggage for the most part will not effect a person very much long 
term.  

The use and level of experimentation though I se in the crowd there 
was for a good part more than that occasional thing.  It is 
commonplace.  You go out to a club or an event every week and perhaps 
several times a week and you get your thing of make your mind sing.

See I couldn't really careless about the drugs.  But I do care about 
the social stigma of such on OUR scene.  I care about the liability 
that lays on the backs of every promoter.

What if the experimental person OD's.  Who gets the shit in the face 
folks?  The promoter and everyone associated with the scene, but 
especially the promoter.  But we know drugs would never cause anyone 
to do somethig stupid like that.

That is why I support legalization.  Deaths occur when dealers add 
really crappy and dangerous cuts to the drugs or in the case of 
heroin not enough of a cut.

Arrogant perhaps it is.  We must accept certain things in life.  
Unfortunately this society in this date of time is not accepting drug 
useage even in moderate casual usage as anything other than a 
wasteful criminal act.

Some go to raves for the drugs?  Some end up in drug rehab because of 
raves.  Fair enough.

I hate the danger associated with drugs.  I hate the land grabbing by 
the dealers.  I hate the suspicion and paranoia caused by it.  I hate 
risk associated with being around the drug element because of 1) the 
social stigma and relative criminal sanctions  and 2) the 
irresponsible acts by people on drugs who try to perform normal 
functions while under the influence of ANY drug.  I include alchol in 
all these items as a drug as well which impairs and destroys.
 
If people actually go to RAVES for the drugs,  I am sure I can find a 
nice big dealer who will spot a nice house with blaring music and 
their drugs.  

Smiles ;)

Yes.  Why is it so bad for someone to go to a party to have fun by
consuming a psychoactive chemical?

I really don't understand.  Is the beggar trying to collect enough
money to get into a party?  Are all beggars the result of doing 
drugs at parties?

>Why is it so bad?  Because they are nagging a whole lot of them. 

People who recreationally do drugs at parties?
 
>They are a liability waiting to happen.  

Are mountain climbers a liability, too?  If you are referring to
being a liability to the rave scene - the whole concept is a 
liability.  Large dance parties with teens and young adults that lasts
for 10-12 hours, all night in warehouses and the like. 

>Experimental sorts who at an

>nothing'.  A holier and drugier than thou crowd.

I do not condone the use of drugs among minors.  It is not only minors
who go to parties for drugs.  Most Americans who go to clubs and bars
every weekend do so to do drugs.  Most are 21 and over.

[...]

>See I couldn't really careless about the drugs.  But I do care about

Which is a wonderful argument for decriminalization.  

Do you also think that cramming 3000 people into a warehouse that doesn't 
have enough fire exits is a liability to the scene/promoters?  Do you
think allowing <18 year olds to dance for 11pm - 9am isn't a liability?

>What if the experimental person OD's.

That would be sad.  However, what does this have to do with the millions
of Americans who don't?  I am not condoning the abuse of drugs (which can
result in OD).  I am arguing that there are responsible people who go to 
raves to recreationally use drugs. 

>Who gets the shit in the face 
>folks?  The promoter and everyone associated with the scene, but 
>especially the promoter.  

That is unfortunate.  Scapegoats are always going to be found.  Noone
wants to accept personal responsibility for their actions.

>But we know drugs would never cause anyone 
>to do somethig stupid like that.

No.  Stupidity and ignorance (or contamination do the the illegal
status of drugs) does.  Overdose, although very real, is not a
big factor with most drugs found at raves.  There is, what I would
term, psychological overdose.  But this, although not to be taken
too lightly, is not what is normally implied by overdose.

>That is why I support legalization.  Deaths occur when dealers add 
>really crappy and dangerous cuts to the drugs or in the case of 
>heroin not enough of a cut.

Yes.  The biggest problem is unknown dosage.  People estimate how much
they can handle based on previous experience.  However, the previous
experience may have been a much small dosage.  Anyway,  I don't think
heroin is a big problem at raves.  And I do not consider it a drug that
people go to raves to do.  People my go for E, Acid and K, but I have
never heard of anyone going for H.

[...]

>Some go to raves for the drugs?  Some end up in drug rehab because of 
>raves.  Fair enough.

I have never met anyone who has gone either to rehab or NA or the like
whose sole supplies were purchased at raves.  In fact, the only people
I know who have been to rehab or raves are not ravers (and only one was
involved with the club scene).

[...]

>If people actually go to RAVES for the drugs,  I am sure I can find a 
>nice big dealer who will spot a nice house with blaring music and 
>their drugs.

Exactly.  I don't think *anyone* goes to a rave only for drugs or
only for music.  People go for many reasons.  One of which may be
drugs.

Wayne.

Oh my god, could it be...?!  An _intelligent_ post on NE-Raves?!  Will 
wonders never cease?  I've already alerted wayne of his being awarded 
my official *MAD PROPS* award for simply being cool.  I remember when I 
first got on this list, I dunno, around a year and a half ago or so, this 
same debate was going on.  Being seventeen years old at the time, I 
vehemently stood up for those ravers under 18 years old.  I've been into 
the scene for a while longer now, I'm 18 years old, and I feel I can add 
some things that I wasn't able to add before.

It's become painfully obvious to me that the general mentality of this 
list _is_ very "holier than thou".  Blah blah blah "Well _I_ go for the 
music, and thus I'm a better, purer raver, and I believe in plur, and so 
I'm better..." blah blah blah.  These are the sentiments being echoed 
every single day on this list.  There are, of course, a number of very 
intelligent people on here, more progressive in their thinking, who defy 
this mentality.  *MAD PROPS* to them all.

I personally see raving as a progressive movement.  At its best, perhaps, 
it is downright subversive.  I dig subversiveness, to be honest (as if 
you all hadn't guessed that yet).  I like drugs.  My first drug 
experience was at age 15, when I smoked some pot with a few of my good 
friends.  It was nothing less than a full-on spiritual experience.  Ever 
since I have been using drugs, a number of which are not at all 
politically correct to use by this list's standards.  And you know what?  
I give not a shit.

You all whine about little kids messing up everything by using way too 
many drugs.  Hmm, let's think about this a moment.  How many of us smoke 
cigarettes (yes, I do too)?  Keep in mind that one out of three of us who 
now smokes cigarettes will die because of it.  Oh wow, that's higher than 
the percentage of kids who will die due to the use of k and crystal combined!
Hypocrites.

Maybe if the older generation _weren't_ so holier than thou (in general) 
and hypocritical (in general), and actually gave a damn about embracing the 
younger generation of ravers, then there wouldn't be such a "problem", or 
perceived problem at least.  I've always had a lot of significantly older 
friends.  Back when I was 14 I had friends who were 18, 20, even older, 
who I had met through local BBSes.  I don't know what it was, but me and 
my younger friends were _always_ accepted by the older folks.  They were 
role-models as well as friends; most importantly, they encouraged us to 
_think_.

My, how this is a different scene.  Turn your backs on the younger kids.  
They will not stop raving, you must realize... the scene is too big for 
that now.  No, by turning away the younger generation, you are dooming us 
all to a vibeless, cheesy, MTV-like fate.  Thanks a lot, the scene loves 
you, all-mighty NE-Raves Cybertribe.

This is to the person that was asking where Sammie was from (sorry I don't
remember who you were) He's from Nashville, I think.....

Does anyone know where Natural's happening at? or where the area code
312 is?

-Ravin-   (rabidrat@iglou.com)
v-rave: huggybear!
==================================================================

there wuz no Sammie from Nashville scheduled to spin @ 720.

there wuz a Sammie from Columbus there however. actually
Sammie goes to school in columbus (OSU). originally from 
akron. used to party alot in cleveland, part of the old
skool Sooper Wack posse w/ Alex aka Tik Tak of Spawntaneous.
my girl, christa, used to visit him all the time when he
wuz workin on campus. i think he's just about finished w/
his degree there now. he spends alot of his free time
spinning @ the CCAD rave cave on oak st (i believe) w/
jonathan & steve & the rest of the crew there.

Thank you to all who came out to Tribute - The Jive Turkeyz Last Event

Why is it our last event. Because of lack of respect for the Immaculate
space that we had. The damage done to our space last night is going to cost
me at least $800(Money that I do not have) These are FREE parties that I
did out of the love for this scene. Instead I got shit on by everyone and
their mother.

1st problem we had was mother fucking scribblers... If I find the guy who
did that shit I'm gonna take your FUCKING CRAYOLAS and shove them up your
ass. We had 3 tags in the bathroom, not 15 minutes after the party started.
==================================================================

yup dats the exact same reason spawntaneous lost it's space for COVeRT.
but somehow wuz able to get it back for 720. but ed from ele mental
is the man to talk to about throwing free partys & losing money.

don't let the pricks get to yah & keep on keepin on! both christa & i
had a real good time @ TRIBUTE (eventho we got lost trying to find it!)
review forthcoming, but right now i gotta get ready to go to work. plus
i'm a li'l tired from driving from cleveland to columbus (to pick up
christa). from columbus to pittsburgh (for TRIBUTE). from pittsburgh
to columbus (to drop of christa & pick up jenny). from columbus to
cleveland (for 720). from cleveland to columbus (to drop off jenny &
spend the rest of the day sleeping @ christa's). and then from columbus
back to cleveland!

oh yah i dropped off yur flyers for 2ND AGO @ 720, but i wuz so tired
from driving so much i couldn't enjoy myself too much @ the party.
review for TRIBUTE & 720 forthcoming. but right now i gotta go to work...

               Directions:
               
               From the south:
               Take I-95 north.  Exit at I-395, then take the
               exit to Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.  Take King 
               Boulevard until it ends at Howard Street (remain in
               one of the middle lanes of King Boulevard to avoid 
               a premature forced right or left turn). Turn left
               at Howard Street and proceed about 2 miles. One 
               block past 29th Street (where Howard Street becomes 
               Art Museum Drive), turn left at the traffic island 
               (just before the Baltimore Museum of Art) onto Wyman
               Park Drive. Take an almost immediate right through the 
               university gates.  Follow directions below.
               
               From the north:
               Take I-95 south to 695 (Baltimore beltway) west.  Take 
               the beltway toward Towson to exit 25. Take Charles 
               Street south for about 7 miles (when Charles Street 
               splits a block after Loyola College and Cold Spring 
               Lane, take the right fork). As you approach the 
               university and cross University Parkway, continue 
               southbound but be sure to jog right onto the service 
               road. After you pass the university on the right, turn 
               right onto Art Museum Drive. Just after the Baltimore
               Museum of Art, bear right at the traffic island onto 
               Wyman Park Drive.  Take an almost immediate right 
               through the university gates. Follow directions below.
               
               From Baltimore City:
               Take Charles Street north to 29th.  Make a left on 29th,
               and immediately get in the right lane.  You will see a 
               fork in the road, veer right.  You will go around a 
               curve to the right, and then merge with traffic heading 
               north.  Immediately after merging, you will turn left 
               onto Wyman Park drive.  Take an almost immediate right 
               through the university gates. Follow directions below.
               
               Once on the campus:
               There will be brick buildings on the left and a parking
               lot and a field on the left.  Drive past the parking lot
               and the field and make a left just after passing the 
               square building on the left.  Make a right at the first 
               opportunity.  You will go down hill and under a bridge.  
               As you go up and reach the top of the hill on the other
               side of the bridge, there will be a paking lot on the left.
               Park here.  The party will be located on the other side of 
               the building that runs parallel to the lot.  
               
               Hope to see you there!

i was
       -looking forward to hearing ...

        In my opinion, I don't know why this guy is so big. All he played
at tribute were these minimal 2/2 beats for an hour and half. Yeah, his
records were hard, but they were very boring and unmusical, if you weren't
dancing. As far as I saw all he did was put on a track, wait for it to
finish, then put on another track that sounded exactly like it. I'm not a
DJ, but I know I could do that!!!!
        Someone please tell me what's so great about Jordan Vesteyo because
I lack respect for DJ's who show up and play other people music without any
origianlity. It didn't even look like he was having fun spinning!!!
        Otherwise tribute was a fucking blast!!! My favorite part was when
Buda spun some Mister Rogers right before he played his
hard-hard-hard-hard-hardcore songs!!!!


        On that same note, 720 on Saturday was also damn near the party of
the summer so far (well, I didn't go to FA2, FantasiaII, or the Sunrise
Festival [i hate myself for that]).
         Here are my highlights:
-I met really cool people and had a reunion with three ohio ravers I love
for giving me a ride home from BUSY when it got busted (I can't even
remeber one of the girls names, but you know who you are Chris and
Shenade). -
-The lights were fucking amazing and the vibe was just right. -
-All three rooms were dope; I just wish they had at least one of the
junglists on the main dance floor (LOUD AS HELL!!).-
-There aren't that many things I can complain about, exept the outside
(funky fresh breakbeats) never really got enough power. THey should of had
a seperate generator. Inside the music was nice and loud but when I went
home there was no ringing in my ears!!
-Swamp was awesome. Tik Tak was fresh. Sine was 412 representin' !! Other
than that everyone spun well and I didn't keep track at all.-

Okay, Hossam: I'm sure you have recieved enough grief from your posts so
this isn't inteded as an insult to your intelligence. However, i must give
this tiny little issue you brought up some justice. This issue is
*EDUCATION*:

 (Hossam A. El-Saie)  wrote:
        i think ive read nearly every damn thing there
        is out there at hyperreal and on alt.drugs before i ever ingested
        a drug. and if i chose to do something, it was with a full
        acceptance and comprehension of the risks involved.

Sounds like a very diversified education to me....hyperreal is not the only
source of information on drug use. In fact it strikes me as a good place to
rationalize your drug use after the fact and enable many others who are
thinking of experimenting. Sure it has stories of bad drug experiences and
has precautions; but many of these facts hyppereal has are organized in
such a way to convey the writers personal opinion, much like any piece of
literature, so take hyperreal's drug info section for what it really is. It
is not the definitive drug information site. Neither is the FDA or FBI or
Timothy Leary or Ken Kesey. Publications by these parties are, although
interesting, rarely backed by hard scientific evidence. If they are, the
evidence is fudged in a very clever fashion with the rest of the
propaganda.
        Those handbooks we got were a good to grab peoples interest in
responsibility, but again, they don't tell us the side effects of doing a
particular drug. Passing out those handbooks alone is not a solution; going
to Hyperreal alone is not a solution.
        I suggest not only learning about drugs from hyperreal and other
drug advocates like Tim Leary, Ken Kesey, your friends, etc., but also from
case studies in medical journals. But remeber to take any study for what it
is. Keep in mind how big the survey/study is, what group is doing the
researching and their reputation in the scientific community, etc.
Statistics can be played with very easily. A survey done by the New York
Times is much more reliable than a survey done by High Times. Don't just
read what you want to hear, that will get you in more trouble then you
think your trying to prevent.

gave one reason for why i quit doing drugs, or drinking, or smoking, or 
biting my toenails or WHAT THE FUCK EVER, it is the only reason.  did i 
enjoy doing drugs? once in a while.  but please.  i smoked pot at one 
event & slept the whole way through it.  i did K at an even t i didnt 
particularly enjoy & was stuck at, and oh boy i sat there with a dopey 
grin on my face the rest of the nite.  OH JOY!  these experiences are 
just some of a few.  do you REALLY think i am one of the 2 people in the 
world who learns form others' mistakes? "oh dont go out with bobby, he 
broke my heart".  "oh ok." yeah whatever.  bill you obviously didnt get 
to know me during the 2 whole days we hung out ;p  because i only do what 
i want, i'm a big brat that way ;)  i mean hello... were u paying

OH MY GAWD I GOT FLAMED.  =P~~~~~

whats wrong with these kids going to do drugs?!?! please THINK before u post.

the problem is that trhese are the kids who make the events get shut down 
(some of them  NOT ALL OF THEM) because of irresponsibly & ILLEGALLY 
dealing drugs.  these are the kids who i have to share the road with 
driving home ffrom the canceled event while they are still under the 
influence.  these are the kids who get sick & die at events, these are 
people i know and dont want to see die.  i'm not saying "oh dont do drugs 
at the parties! oh no, we must have a parellel universe!" i'm saying, if 
u go for whatever reason i could care les.  my point is that i go for the 
music which is one of the main points of going AM I WRONG?  is it NOT one 
of the crucial things here, do you go to parties where there is no music? 
well.. umm... my guess is NO.  and true i dont think i've ever been to an 
event without drugs there, but WAY too many ppl get messed up & overdose, 
or end up doing things they woudlnt do otherwise, because they dont use 
in moderation.  i have no problem with anyone who can do their drugs 
without it effecting me, or them hurting themselves.  that is not an 
issue at all.  however i'm tired of being flamed by yall for sharing a 
fucking opinion, did we NOT have a big discussion about this a month ago?

It is bad for the liability problem,  the anger problem displayed by 
the whacked out people who can not control their substance, bad for 
the interference caused with my vibe as a result of these people
doing irresponsible things.

It is quite alright with me if people use their druggage responsibly 
and on their own.  

When they cross the line or have an advertising campaign like they 
often do,  that is when it is bad.

Responsible usage of anything is NOT frowned on by almost anyone 
ever.  Usually such usage will go undetected by most everyone.

The beggar is a leech as are alot of the irresponsible people ABUSING 
substances at parties.  They are a liability to all of us and become 
a responsibilty of the promoters when they decide to overdo it.

Oh definitely the length is a libaility issue.  That is why alot of 
promoters make sure there is water available for  people and other 
items of conscious security.

Mountin climbers are a liabilty as are skydivers.  Just check out 
life insurance and accident insurance related to either sort of

The normal club heads are full of substane abusers without a doubt.  
An older crowd for the most part.  But a really brainwashed happy to 
normal crowd who I am down on too.  Notice I do not visit their 100% 
commercial events/clubs because of the machoisms,  discriminations,  
lewd conduct,  lack of style, taste, etc.

As before it is a liabilty.  And today really,  promoters should be 
more responsible as well.  I do not frequent events that are risky or 
where I face the potential of death or arrest.

To those who use and carry on a normal life I give the handclapper.
And there are responsible folks there who use their substance 
responsibly.  And to them a handclapper also.

But the responsible is not what my argument has been about.  It is 
about the irresponsible.  The brighter than you young-ones.  The  get 
dosed to be cool crowd,  etc.

May I ask what does K stand for?

The Hero-in is a biggy in the Pacific Northwest.  Alot of substances 
are being powered up with traces or derivatives of the good ole H.

The scene like any other is competitive when it comes to drug supply 
and useage.  It happens that some commit to the anti-drug "rehab" 
centers.

It occurs that dealers get violent about their supplying a community.

Respect due to all the scene everywhere.

Respect and unity.  Once we achieve this everything else will be 
alright.

Of course.  However, it is based on a valid interpretation of the 
primary sources.  The contributors to the faqs on hyperreal are
very privy to current studies (although the FAQ-MDMA is somewhat
outdated).

Most journals don't publish case studies of drug use.  Most studies
done on drugs are done on lab animals (rats are most often because they
are cheap.  Monkeys (and in particular old world monkeys), however, are 
a better indicator of human effects).  Very few human studies exist.
Those that do are poorly controlled because of polydrug use among 
participants.  Also, even though medical journals are part of the peer 
reviewed process, they are biased.  And lastly, most of the faqs on 
hyperreal have references to the primary literature.

[...]

This is not the most valid way to interpret scientific data.  The best
way is based soley on the merrits of the study.  Even reputable researchers
will have limited control over their controls ;-).  

[...]

>A survey done by the New York
>Times is much more reliable than a survey done by High Times.

Neither the New York Times nor High Times are a peer reviewed journal.  
So, the point is mute.  Neither are a very reliable source of scientific
information.  The NYT has a decent science reporter, but even so, he
is still not the primary source.

>Don't just
>read what you want to hear, that will get you in more trouble then you
>think your trying to prevent.

This is somewhat correct.  However, the faqs on hyperreal are, although
biased, a pretty accurate portrayal of the real risks.  Most of the
faqs list primary sources.  There are very few people who can read
the primary source and understand it.  So, reading these studies is 
not as fruitful as one might think.  If you are truly interested in primary
sources, you can do a medline search to get bibliographic info and abstracts.

http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/onthefly.html

However, most public libaries won't carry the journals listed.  You
will most likely need to go to a large university libary to check
out many of the journals (public libraries and small universities
and colleges will often only carry _JAMA_, _Science_, and _Nature_).

I usually do.

I don't know of any events that got shut down because of drugs. (Although
Structure, Mars' weekly party in Asbury Park, NJ did.  The drug was mostly
marijuana.)  Most parties that get shut down are for noise or fire code
violations.  

Again, that some do is just another argument for decriminalization.
I can go to a bar and get wasted to oblivion on alcohol, but I can got 
to a rave and take a hit of E.

Which is not worse (and in some cases probably better) than sharing the
road with someone who is exhausted after dancing all night.  Both
are irresponsible acts.  Neither is better than the other.  And I
would argue against both of them.  

>these are the kids who get sick & die at events,

Huh?  Can you please provide me with a reference to these deaths that
occur at events?  The last death I heard about was Leah from the UK who
died of water intoxication.  Very few drugs done at raves have the
potential for death.

>these are 
>people i know and dont want to see die. 

What drugs are they doing that you are worried about death?
Anyway, I am not arguing for drug abuse.  I am arguing for drug
use.  Many kids (and I am hoping this is referring to young adults.
I don't condone the use of drugs among minors.) use drugs responsibly.
And many of them go to raves with this as one of their main reasons.

Possibly for some people.  Many people I know (although they sorta like
the music) couldn't care less who was spinning or what style of music
they spin.

And this is all I am requesting (and that group includes people
who go there for the sole purpose of getting f***ed up).  (However, 
many people think it effects them to see people strung out; to that, 
I disagree that it is effecting them.)

Just thought I'd let you know that this party is partially to kick off
the new station. We *may* be broadcasting the Jive Festival on 90.9FM.
We did this at Electric Kingdom and *might* be able to do it here 
(with more power of course). Either way we will be distributing out
our usual propaganda: stickers, program guides etc. Also we will be
putting out an appeal for help. If any of you DJ or have something you'd
like to rant about on a regular basis on the radio here's your chance to
reach the East Side of Pittsburgh every week. For the modest donation of
$5 a month you can have your own 45 minute show. If interested in this
come see us at the Jive Festival. We will probably have brown bags over
our heads with eyes cut into them. We'd like to thank all who have 
supported us up to this point and we'd like to thank the Jive Turkeyz for

Subject: The Rewind...
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

By now I'm sure most of us have seen the pre-flier for Underground Inc.'s
upcoming final event, a sequel to last winter's Jungle Warfare, The Rewind.
Now, we all know that so far John and the rest of Udg. (whoever that
includes these days I'm not particularly sure) have never failed to put
together one helluva bash for us raving loonatics.  Must big up i say!
Furthermore, The Rewind promises to be just as good a party as all the
previous Udg shindigs.  A solid lineup of U.S. junglists, as a matter of
fact, I'd hazard a guess that you can't FIND a better crew of U.S. jungle
d.j.s than the one UDG booked for The Rewind.  However, it seems to me that
in these days of the Jungle Explosion in America, when everybody and their
mumz are jumpin on thee jungle bandwagon, throwing all jungle parties and
putting Junglists on lineups everywhere, that this lineup seems kind of
lackng.  What is it lacking?  LTJ Bukem, Kemistry and Storm, Goldie, or any
other U.K. Junglist.  Baltimore and New York are playing host monthly to
Junglists from overseas, and the parties are going extremely well.  Jungle
is becoming a really big thing in the U.S. rave scene, and its even getting
cooler outside the rave scene too.  Thus, when Udg. announced plans to make
its final party another all jungle party, many thought it would be a great
idea.  I think it is.  However, the competition as far as high-quality
jungle parties (with jungle djs from overseas especially) in my opinion is
too great to make The Rewind as special as it should be.  

So, I am offerring a solution.  I suggest to Udg. (and offer this suggestion
for approval from the list) that they keep the absolutely top-notch jungle
lineup
as is.  However, to make this party REALLY SPECIAL for Pittsburgh, I'd like
to see UDG bring back the second room to a Pittsburgh party.  Now, since I
have been known to spin some ambient tunes, and since that has put me in
touch with many other (top-notch) ambient djs on the East Coast, I'd like to
offer my services.  I am ready, willing, and able to coordinate the booking
of ambient djs, and the organization of a chillout room for The Rewind. As a
matter of fact, I'd be willing to do that for any Pittsburgh party.  Adding
a second (chillout) room to The Rewind would put it on another level in
comparison to every other one room Pittsburgh party, and make it competitive
with the parties of other East Coast cities.  I have heard that UDG was
going to promote the rewind heavily.  Why not make this added bonus part of
the enticement for East Coasters to head to Pittsburgh?  I honestly don't
think a one room, no gimmicks party is going to pull in a sizable crowd
these days.  Its just not what East Coast ravers want.  Thus, I want to help
make The Rewind as good a party as it possibly can be.  Udg _and_ Pittsburgh
DESERVES it. :D

So, thoughts?  Questions? Complaints? Flames?  please send them all my way :) 

much Peace, Love, Unity and Respect

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can

Golden Joy	Sat aug 3, 1996		Pittsburgh, pa
When we first got involved in this scene we were awed by many things.  
The most memorable was the sheer energy and excitement of going to a new 
space, hearing sick DJs and the feeling of a massive sound system moving 
your body.  These are the things that we kept in mind while panning this 
event.  We invite you to come and hear some of the best DJ talen in the 
US and groove to one of the most musically complete line-ups Pittsburgh 
has ever seen on one of the best sound systems ever brought here.  this 
party isn't for egos, names or glory... this party is for you to end your 
summer properly.  Peace.

I'm stuck in a bleary, cottony, sleepy blur that 2 huge cups of coffee 
haven't cut thru and I find it thereaputic to make like an ne-raves 
person and write an off-topic post.

Not totally.

With great pleasure I watch the cute urban raver rugrats saunter around the 
streets of Oakland, daily ebbing and flowing in and out of local 
establishments like gentle wavelets on the Chesapeake.  I wonder to 
myself, do the owners get angry?  

I stumble cottonly to the Beehive at a godless hour this morning.  a sign 
on the door says it prohibits the entry of humans under the age of 17 
until 3pm, mon-fri.  This would make sense if school were in session.  It 
is not.  

Although loitering rugrats (I say that with the greatest affection) may 
be an annoyance to store owners, they hold a special place in my heart 
and I find it quite FASCIST that the Beehive pronounces them banishe'd, 
almost Shakespeareanly, until such time as they see fit to serve them.

my 2 cents, which is more than the tip I gave the woman at the counter 
who I believe to be an owner or manager,

frank...(and the rest of yinz)

the reason that the rewind (jw2) doesnt have any uk dj's is because it
doesnt make any sense (financially) to have any. 

damian, id be interested in what your comments to this are as well, reply 
to the list if you would...

already, it is almost guaranteed that lots of ppl will go to jw2 because of
the assembled lineup.. (as you said, one of the best compilations of u.s.
junglists to date) and due to the fact that john and co. will personally
hand out hundreds of flyers for this party.

why should they book a uk dj? round trip airfare will cost no less than
$400 (thats if u want your guest of honour to fly with the cargo) and more
prolly in the $800/person roundtrip range.. add to that the possibility of
an mc, and one or more of their mates and u have lets say *conservatively*
$1500 in additional plane fare...then theres the matter of dj fees...a well
known jungle dj with any sort of draw is going to be losing out on *alot*
of money by spinning here in the states...if u consider the fact that many 
of the dj's u mentioned spin more than one gig a night due to the fact that
london is relatively easier to get around than the entire east coast....

in other words, a hype or bukem can spin 2 or 3 diff sets at diff times all
in the same nite and *still* charge the full rate...they can and have been
doing this for years now...so to ask a uk dj to give up maybe 500 to 1000
pounds per gig (roughly $825-$1650 at the current exchange rate) to fly 
over to the us and miss out on at least 2 days they could be spinning (lets
say 4 gigs) ($825x4 = $3300) now all im saying is that's what they COULD be
making....im not necessarily saying that what they would be charging, only
what they could theoretically be worth/missing out on...

some dj's would want to come to the u.s. whether it be the lure of a free
vacation, a desire to check out the scene, a love to spread the music, or
the possibility of shopping (as in ltj bukem's case and his penchant for
new sneakers that you cant get in the uk ;)

but again, why would they want to come here? the more exposure concept isnt
really valid b/c they are already live in the uk, the birthplace of jungle
(thatd be like telling oj simpson to move to zimbabwae, so that he could
get more media coverage than he does in the states). and som edj's just
plain dont want to come to the u.s. i have it on good authority that the dj
that alot of us would *LOVE* to see, dj hype, isnt coming to the u.s.
anytime soon just b/c he doesnt like it here and generally doesnt like
americans..(if any of you disagree with me, email me personally and ill put
you in touch with someone who has spoken to him on this issue)..i asked my
friend "even if he was offered $5000(US) he wouldnt come?" and my friend
said probably not...to me that sucks, but i can see the point...add to 
that the potential that u can book a uk dj and pay for his ticket only
to have them barred entry into the country (remember bukem @ rengades 1?)

and lets not forget that this is john's last party in pgh before he moves
to nyc.. and you know its expensive living in new york city, and udg has
never been one to shy away from the possibility of making LOOT at a
party...tunnel vision? mad cash? john and ryan and their friends on
vacation right afterwards? yeah....so john is gonna throw a kick ass party
that alot of ppl will enjoy and feel they got their money's worth, but john
is also keeping one eye wisely on his budget coz this is HOW HE MAKES HIS
LIVING..he doesnt have the luxury of a 9-5 like some of us, and i doubt the
scene will feel ripped off by his effort...so as far as uk jungle dj's go,
i can see why this aint happening and while it would be great to have one
(but we *are* getting bukem at ENIT..fucking wicked) at a pgh party, i dont
think the economic realities will allow it...bukem and tayla and conrad ae
getting PAID for ENIT, its a guaranteed check for them for a succession of
dates, its almost the only way u.s. promoters can afford to bring over uk
dj's..(look into how many times a uk dj has come over soley to play one
gig.. its very very rare)..exceptions notwithstanding... i think what im
saying will generally hold true...

frank, you know i have never been anything but *totally* honest with you
right? so here the story...i honestly dont believe that an ambient/second/
chillout room or what have u will be *ANY* sort of draw...the ONLY thing i 
could imagine would be a second room of someone spinning funk or maybe dub
or roots reggae or possibly acid jazz...but most likely the jungle scene
and the ambient (in a very strict sense of the word) scene will not have 
alot of overlap...i mean if you want proof, look at cloudwatch...they along
with a few crews in nyc undoubtedly throw the biggest/best/classiest
ambient shows...and STILL lg has to plead for ppl to show up.. i dont think
theyve ever broken 400 and are lucky to get 300 ppl to show.. and thats a
heavily promoted (all thru bmore/dc and in RETINA) event...they get kick
ass djs and still its a hard sell...

if udg wanted to add a second room, why wouldnt they add a house room like
they do in chicago and elsewhere in the midwest where theres been loads of
jungle parties with smaller house rooms...i mean if your focus is on at
least breaking even or hopefully making some money (for all your effort),
then a house room is alot safer than an ambient room.

as a friend of mine told me (NOT MY WORDS) " nobody wants to pay money to
go to sleep"


i know you ambient lovers out there are very passionate about your music, 
as you should be...but i realsitically dont think (and this isnt a diss) 
that someone will look at a jw2 flyer and go "ak1200, ehh...dieselboy,
ehh..odi, eh...FUCKING HELL!! an ambient room! I'M GOING!" 

:) if its not what east coast ravers want, why is there such low attendance
at ambient shows and by your own admission, very good turnout at jungle 
events lately? even one room, all u.s. jungle events...i can't wait til the
scene is big and sophisticated enuff that a uk jungle dj is a prerequisite 
for any jungle show, but we're not there yet...most of us are happy with 8+
hrs of the music we love, surrounded by ppl who share our appreciation of 
the style...dont take it personally frank please...its not your fault that
its this way and again, this is just my opinion...

no flames this aint ne-raves...if we cant have a rational discussion (this 
is to all the pgh massive, not just frank) and at the very least AGREE to 
disagree, the fuck it...no one will even bother posting their opinions.

i for one love the fact that theres so much traffic on this list.

i just dont see an ambient room being a draw...i could be wrong however...
i lost my crystal ball a  while back and can no longer accurately predict 
the future...;)


LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK...


peace,
hossam

I know I am somewhat fruity maybe. 

BUT does anyone else out here get tired of the lack of vocal 
arrangement lately in what the Djs are spinning.

I was at Tribute.  There were no vocals in any of the music expect 
the one assfuck sample,  Buda's Satan arrangement,  and a few looped 
to death vocal.  But no real vocal skill stuff.

I picked up a couple Djs tapes.  Played em to some friends and they 
said the stuff sounded like elevator music.  It was jungle style 
stuff so it had some wicked beats.

Any Djs caring to add vocals to their spinning or are we just going 
to get the monotone head pounding ambient on speed sound for a long 
time.

there are vocals' or samples in many happy hardcore songs, less
in gabberhaus. (gabber somehow doesn't lead itself to singing;)

but alot of the time the vocals are provided by the emcee's, who
can more easlly toast and work up a crowd if they are not doing it
over vocals ;)

secondly ... why the dependence on vocals, if the song has a nice keyboard
line (ala Toytown) or a couple of cool samples. Vocals can get in the way
of the music, and distract the listener ... (how many classical songs
do u know with diva's)

I've become totally addicted to acid trance/hard trance and am getting
frustrated because I don't know who is who.  I know Hardfloor and a
handful of other fantastic artists, but that's about it. 

What I want to do is get my hands on some quality dj mix tapes that I keep
reading about on this list.  Does anyone have a source for these?  The key
to my request is that the TB303 bass line machine has to be in full swing
on these tunes, if you know what I mean.

Thanks for your help.  My review of 720 is on the way.

Braden

on behalf of some of the djs that r looking for bookings by placing a
posting on the internet, i'd like to pitch in 2 pennies and let everyone
know how i feel.
 
first of all, i respect those djs & commend them for using an effective
media, the internet in an effort to try and reach as many ppl as possible
on seraves & any other parts of the world.  it shows that they're trying
hard to let everyone know that they want to introduce their talents to your
areas.  if you're interested hearing their gig live, we as ppl with
internet access ought to put a few words into our promoters & let them know
that dj so & so is looking for bookings.  regardless of whether if it's dj
joe smith, or if it's someone with a well-developed reputation such as
orbital or photek, everyone has their highs' and lows in their lives, and
are trying hard to let everyone know that they're interested in doing a gig
in your town.  so i think everyone should have a fair chance in letting
everyone know that they're interested in doing a gig.
 
secondly, for those of u who r so frustrated with such postings, with a
click of a mouse, u can hit delete & trash the posting, and *NOT* send
prank mail to them by letting them know that u don't want them putting up
such postings.  yeah, it may get on your nerves in your perspective, but
not everyone is like that.  i'm always on the look, and i'd like 2 support
as many ppl as i can if they're lookin' for gigs in an effort to introduce
new talents into our scene & other outta town scenes if they may b
interested.

so please, all i ask is that u all give everyone a chance, and don't
bombard them with negative e-mail or bad-mouth them when they're trying
hard to get a gig to introduce new talents in your scene, okay?

 
cheers,



seul    :)

.: it has been written

> putting Junglists on lineups everywhere, that this lineup seems kind of
> lacking.  What is it lacking?  LTJ Bukem, Kemistry and Storm, Goldie, or 
> any other U.K. Junglist. 

	personally, i love to see british jungle djs.  they almost always
	have fresh hot dubplates burbling with new tunes.  seeing a bukem
	or a grooverider on the wheels is a chance for me to hear something
	new and innovative (for the most part).  kemistry and storm last
	weekend in baltimore...no complaints.  always great to hear stuff
	that isn't sitting in my record box.

	the point to focus on, however, is how 'educated' the us junglists
	are.  how many of the junglists out there go to record stores weekly
	to hear the latest 12"s and pre-releases?  i would hazard a guess
	that it is a small percentage.  how many us junglists out there (not
	djs) get promos and tests from record labels?  once again, i would
	say very very few.  what is my point?  it has been my experience that
	alongside dubplates, a good portion of uk jungle djs sets are made
	up of current tunes that are either on promo or are available in the
	shops....tunes that us jungle djs have in their boxes.  i am fairly
	confident that when i step to the decks at a party, i am going to
	have at good bit of tunes that are brand spanking new that very
	few people on the dance floor will have heard.  most people out there
	wouldn't know a dubplate tune from something on promo or released
	within the past 2 weeks.  good music is good music...and it is 
	actually funny how many people get into songs they *know* over
	songs they don't know.  i still get requests for 'super sharp
	shooter remix'.  i have heard uk djs play a set in which i owned 
	80% of the tunes.  unless you are in the shops every week, how do
	you know what is new or what isn't new?  and if new records aren't
	exactly the point of bringing over a uk dj, i can assure you that
	we have quite a few jungle djs stateside with more in the skills
	department than most of the big uk names.  believe it.  for example,
	grooverider's set from guarana had some of the *worst* mixing i have
	ever heard...either he trainwrecked, did a quick cut, or backspun
	the record (and not always on time).  i have the tape to prove it.
	
	what this all boils down to is this -- for the average and above
	average punter, there are quite a few stateside selectors who can
	dish it out on the same level as any of the british stars.  the only
	difference would be in the tune selection, and like i said...unless
	you are keeping up weekly on the releases, you wouldn't really know
	what was a dubplate or what was a new release.  new music is new
	music...and at this point in the us scene, 'dubplate' fever isn't
	really into play...not yet at least.

	REWIND will have upfront tunes and tight mixing.  no complaints.

	respects to the sphinx who touched on some very important and very
	valid points in his response.  i couldn't have said it better myself.
	i would also like to add (and no diss to frank) that it would be
	weird for me to post in response to an all house party :

	"you know what this party need?  jungle?  i offer to spin at your
	 party and coordinate a jungle room for you and book all of the djs.
	 is that cool?  let me know what you think."

Well, I agree with you..  to a point.

If a DJ wants people to know that he/she is looking for bookings, then
fine, post it ONCE.  But too many times have djs repeatley posted their
message over and over and over again.  Then it gets VERY tiresome seeing
the same message forwarded to the list about 2 times a month..  I mean,
don't beg to get booked, it will just make you look desprate.   

hehehe, you can be desprate, but don't let other people see you are.
(Words I live by...)  =)

By the way, I am available for bookings... =)

I agree... unfortunately it was kinda odd.  But, I felt that I had to offer
my help in trying to make the Rewind special, and thats what I thought I
could do.  Nothing against an all jungle party.  I just thought that since
everybody seemed to be hyping the Rewind as something HUGE, that I wanted to
try to make it live up to those standards, and was afraid that one room all
jungle wouldn't be what Pittsburgh deserves in a HUGE party.  I mean, we've
DONE that why not move BEYOND? We've already HAD the biggest all jungle
party in America, _WE_ started things rolling for Jungle to break in
Baltimore and all over the place!!! IT WAS PITTSBURGH! that did that... :D
so why the hell should we CONFIRM rather than CREATE!? we shouldn't.  its
irresponsible and we deserve more.   but, regardless of WHAT happens, the
Rewind is going to kick ass... I just wonder if it could kick MORE ass some
how ;)

first off, i understand the reasoning behind not booking a uk junglist for 
the rewind.  it makes sense.
but i think that the point of count zero's post was a bit missed.
*correct me if i'm wrong frank, ok...*

i'm sure that most of us here agree that the pittsburgh scene is in a bit of
a slump right now.  not that it is anywhere near extinction, but the population
has been down.  to build this population back up again, most would agree that
a large well promoted party must be thrown to get both out of town guests,
and new locals to attend.  jungle warfare 2 is trying to do just that.
alot of effort went into getting a solid lineup of jungle dj's and ton's of 
promotion to put everybody in the know.   but the question remains.....
will jw2 really boost the RAVE scene here?  possibly, but not nearly as much
as if the party featured a DIVERSION from 10 hours of
160bpm breakbeats (not to disrespect...).
what this party will do is boost the JUNGLE scene here, and not necessarily
the whole RAVE scene.  what udg should have done (or do if there is time),
is throw together a party just like jw2, but with a variety of dj's spinning
a variety of styles.  put all that promotion and legwork into effect for a
[can i say this] tunnel vision 2.......or something similar.
i feel that is what pittsburgh needs to get back on track.
if anything DID cause pittsburgh parties to lose attendance, it is parties just
like jw2 that feature little variety with no escape from the main room.
that's why..........

a second room, it is a MUST for people like me.
i ABSOLUTELY CAN'T STAND a rave featuring one particular style,
beit jungle, house, gabber, happy hardcore, or opera.
i get extremely bored.  and that is the very reason that i have no plans
to go to jungle warfare.  

and for an ambient second room....well, i must be honest as well and say that
it doesn't fit well in a jungle party.  yes (e. munster) a happy hardcore room
would fit better [actually, it would fit perfect, but i'm partial to hh].
but why not just have a second room featuring all kinds of
different stuff.  perhaps and "abstract" room or something.  maybe have 
house in the beginning, happy hardcore a bit later on, then some acid, and
when it gets later some ambient.  i like chill out rooms, but i never go in 
them until way late when i'm really tired.

well that's my opinion and i could be wrong....

love,
ryu

During the process of working on my next mixtape (called Changes due to come
out in finished form by August 23rd probably, and it will be like the title
says, a change from the "ambient" musings of my earlier work in that it will
include at least one side of beatmatched dance tracks (the crowd screams
"Sell Out" ;))  I realized that FEW promoters in Pittsburgh have my latest
one!  So, I am offering to the list AND to promoters free copies of my
latest mixtape.  Its called Absolute Zer0, and it is 90 minutes of messed up
beats and tripped out head muzak.  Its made for chilling after parties,
smokin' j's, and tweaking your brain as background music.  One thing I'd
like to point out is that this isn't AMBIENT music, most of it has got a
BEAT that you can (creatively) dance to.  Anyway, my point is, email me if
you wanna copy.  OK? :) Also, most importantly, anybody who can give me
addresses of Pittsburgh promoters, I really need to send some copies out to
promoters, so please help me out.  :) Thanks! -Count Zer0

First off Frank, stop bitchin' ;)
Second off, WE ARE GETTING AK1200 from Suburban Base Records!
The preflyer has Overload on it but we are getting AK1200 as a replacement.
As for getting Grooverider, LTJ Bukem, DJ Rap, Kemi and Storm, have you ever priced
these DJ's? Do you have a clue how much it cost to fly a DJ over from the 
UK. GET THEM THROUGH CUSTOMS *AND* pay them? If you can do it go right ahead
it ain't a cheap venture and I doubt at this point it would be wise to do
here anyway. I mean come on, 300 people is a big party now unfortunately and
until we start drawing more people I don't think its wise to fault someone
for not trying to "keep up with the joneses" if we got the crowds NYC and
Baltimore got then fine it would be worth it at this point it isn't.
As for the 2nd room idea, I am for it IF there is a decent crowd. I always
thought there was supposed to be a time in a party where it reached CRITICAL 
MASS. If you are only getting 300-400 people and half of them are in the
other room well then the party tends to seem uh, dead.

Enough of my ranting. I will say this, it is the duty oh EVERY promoter 
to absolutely take advantage of the opportunity that ENIT presents.
Print up at *LEAST* 10,000 flyers for these kids. We may thank Perry Farrel
in the end for re-energizing the scene with fresh new converts.

Until we start expanding then we will have to keep it little or no frills.
Austerity is the way right now I'm afraid. Frank I don't want you to take
this the wrong way but be realistic before you dog a party ok? Alot of
work is going into this to make it as good as Jungle Warfare and it is 
being promoted like TunnelVision. Please don't ruin it due to sour grapes.

     I have witnessed the strength of BUDA.  Club 168 was phat last 
     (Tuesday) night.  Man, you could really see the difference.  The 
     upstairs floor was filled with friendly hardcore people that danced 
     almost the whole time to Buda's massive set.  It was so HARD!  6 
     million ways to die, chose one.  heh heh... he played some record that 
     I asked him about afterward.  If you EVER find a record that is green 
     by some guy named OCTAGON MAN, BUY 2 COPIES RIGHT AWAY!!! (One for 
     you, one for me).  
               The lower floor at the party was so club.  There were about 
     2-3 people dancing, but to me their dancing looks like "frontin'".  
     Everyone downstairs was all dressed out in their big pants and shit.  
       Hardly anyone smiled and all the DJ's looked like they had 
     something up their ass.  What the fuck is up with this wack-ass lame 
     fuckin' club scene.  Nice visor buddy... how much gel is holding your 
     fuckin 1/2 inch of dyed hair flat to your head, Clooney.  Oh well, its 
     a shame they would all be blown to BITS BECAUSE THEY ARE TO FUCKIN 
     LAME TO HANDLE THE EVIL FUCKIN HARDCORE SOUNDS THAT ARE ONLY FOR THE 
     HEADSTRONG!! LONG LIVE FUCKIN DEADLY BUDA!!!!   ITS 8AM AND MY EARS 
     ARE STILL RINGING!!!!  FUCK YOU PRETTY CLUB KIDS!!! I HOPE YOU ALL 
     O.D. ON K AND COKE!!!  TRY CIRCLE DANCIN' TO THE REAL SHIT 
     MOTHERFUCKERS!!! HAHAHAHAA!!!  MAN... ITS NOT ABOUT FUCKIN MONEY, 
     STATUS, OR LOOKS.. ITS ABOUT BEING REAL AND ENJOYING THE MUSIC!!!
     WE AS A PEOPLE WILL GET TO THE PROMISED LAND!!!! SHUT THE FUCK UP BITCH
     YOU CAN'T  SING!!!! PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU WANNA DIE!!!

I agree ... Buda play'ed some hard ass shit ... unfortunatly I had to
leave @ 1 'cause my mates had to wake early and get to work ... 

anyway ... I was'nt to upset cause i got to hear d.cypols first set ...
HappyHardcore! ... though I wish he play 99 red balloons, (my favorite 
choon) and the (new) ultrasonic (well relatively new ... tha dj @ destiny 
two weekends' ago called it that, and it kicked ;)

If u wanna here hardcore, go to brooklyn ... 12hrs of raggin beats ;)

Buda's good, but he is no comparison to Lenny D (i was in the rekkid
store today [Jerry's] and saw a record by Lenny Dee, some chick from the
60's/70's) who is the undisputed king of hardcore ;)

so club? hehe ... u should go to a NYC club, that's where they are bred
(klubkidz). I see any difference downstairs from upstairs', besides the
music
being played and the amount of light

maybe it changed after i left

their my fav's anyways.
the best place i can think of to get mixtapes (especially west coast sounds)
is from pure acid mixtapes, owned by ken lawrence.
he sells a lot of stuff.  the web address is:
http://www.pureacid.com/pureacid
he can send you a snail mail copy of his catalog too if you request it.

Subject: 168 semi review
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

first off, i would like to give my personal thanks to rick
for putting this together like he did.  it's guys like him that
keep scenes movin' and shakin'!!!  also thanks to 168 for 
letting deadly buda and loki melt their speakers......!

first off was phoenix.
i missed his set, and havent' heard him in about 6 months.
he used to be a 'not so good beatmatcher who play the BEST
tracks so his lack of skills was very acceptable' type dj.
i've always been a fan of his because he was spinning hh a 
year and a half ago when absolutely nobody had a clue.
how did he do last night?

then came loki who i also missed (the first time).
i understand that he played a nice hard house/light gabber set.

up next was d.cypol.  my favorite set of the night.
starting off with some breakbeatier happy hardcore, and he slowly
progressed into some harder cheesier stuff that gave me chills
all over!  and to top it off, joe was running around mc'ing with
a cordless mic!  lots of people were dancing all over.
it was a big happy ball of madness!

up next was  deadly buda.  what can i say.
he don't give a damn about nobody's opinions and he mixes
his way and his way only.  i respect that.  he is perhaps the 
most schizophrenic dj i've ever had  the pleasure to hear.
while he lost alot of points in the beatmatching department,
he gained twice that amount in creativity.  for example,
he'd be playing a hard house track, then all of the sudden,
drop in some skinny puppy sounding stuff, then it'd be happy
hardcore.  as soon as you thought he was moving in one direction
with the mix,,,the guy would do a complete u-turn!  the second
half of his set was total speedcore industrial strenght
"fuckin' hostile" evil gabber noise.......and we danced to it!

after buda, loki came on again.  he started off with some 
hard techno, and moved into monstrous gabber very similar to 
buda's.  i left halfway through his set though because i had
to be at work in 4 hours.......(sniff sniff).

anyways, phoenix went on again after loki.
or at least he was scheduled to.
i heard a rumor that he was supposed to spin tagteam with
d.cypol.  did that ever happen???

as for the downstairs....i only walked through there once.
i can't say that the people there were all posers like someone 
said, but the vibe was TOO lazy for me.  but it was supposed
to be like that, so it's cool.  but i came to dance.

without a doubt, my trip to 168 was my BEST club experience
ever!  the question now is:
when is this going to happen again?
the turnout was really great too...probably better than most other
nights at 168.  let's keep this hardcore roller coaster moving!

love,
ryu

wed (7/17/96) - DEFORMED - youngstown, ohio
-------------------------------------------

so i go down to y-town to check out trouty's club thingy & to drop 
off some 720 flyers. gotta admit cedars is much better than the
brillo pad here in cleveland:

+ no cover charge (as opposed to $4 to get in the brillo pad)
+ some lights actually (as opposed to no lights @ the brillo pad)
+ a bar that doesn't rip u off ($1.50 for a rolling rock compared
  to $2.50 @ brillo pad - altho the bartenders gave me funny looks
  ...26 and still getting carded!
+ nice space (large enuff wooden floors for the likes of circle
  dancers as opposed to being cramped in a musty ole basement @
  the brillo pad). they've even got pinball tables in the back!
+ more ravers! (as opposed to a predominantly older, more clueless
  crowd @ the brillo pad)

THE MUSIC:

welp regretably missed jeff/stuff's set - i don't get off work 'til
11pm. but i guess he may have shocked the crowd a li'l when he 
opened w/ a michael jackson song.

pulserver - nice tracks. but his flow wuz not quite as desirable.

jessica - part of the Lovethang cru that threw the pre-party to FA2.
          nice selection of house. another girlie w/ some skillz.

lee - part of the UPS crew. Lee wuz the surprise of the night. i've
      known Lee from promoting, but didn't knew he spun. he actually
      had the best set of the night - spun a few classics & got 
      quite few kids on the floor.

THE PEOPLE:

of course Jamie aka Troutsoup wuz there. surprise to see my ole
roomy Mike Fifer (NUTCRACKER) there sportin' the 'tude by the bar.
Brian (Sugarkids) wuz representin' well in the circles. Vicky 
(jinx's x-roomy) had apparently just moved there from columbus.
other netters there: Kate (our very own softcore geek girl) and
Darrik aka Mindkiss.

afterwards Darrik led a caravan of about ten starvin ravahs to
his hometown of warren, ohio to of all places Park N Eat. if u
ever see a Park N Eat along the side of the road on the way 
back from a party - by all means go to it! Not only is Park N
Eat cheaper but has a much nicer selection. they've even got
low cholestoral entree's marked w/ li'l hearts on the menu.

Despite Jeff & Aron's stupid penis jokes & the li'l food fight
that broke out, a good time wuz had by all & nobody got back at
a respectable time in the morning.

---

friday (7/19/96) - TRIBUTE - pittsburgh, PA
-------------------------------------------

welp we arrived really late to the party since we were stuck in
columbus for some time waiting for some friends who eventually
decided not to come & then of course we had to get lost in downtown
pittsburgh (unfortunately u forgot to give direx coming to the
party from the south, rick!)

dissapointingly only caught the last 15 minutes of jordan vesteyo's
set (the main reason christa wanted to come to the party) as we
passed out flyers for 720. it wuz apparent that jordan wuz trying to
cater to the pittsburgh crowd - spinning happy hardcore, when his
usual format is east coast acid trance. i hate it when dj's do this!
i mean when i go out to see say some one like dieselboy or titonton
i wanna hear jungle! (flashes of titonton forced to spin house @ the
brillo pad still haunt me). jordan's set got increasingly harder as
he paved the way for...

"B-B-B-B-BUDDHA!" (as joe 187 announced on the mc) -  it's been just
about two years since i've heard joel spin (missed him @ Teknosaurus
2 unfortunately) and it appeared he hadn't changed much. Joel's as
hard as ever! he spun some real classics - stuff i used to spin on
my ole college radio show. it wuz really apparent there wuz an
extreme segragation between the old skool ravers that were there 
for mr. buddha and the new skool ravers that were just there. the
old skoolahs were going mental losing it to joel's onslaught of
harder & harder trax as the new skoolers were in the back whining
about when it wuz gonna end. another noticeable difference between
old skool & new skool waze wuz the way Mr. Buddha spun: what he 
wanted when he wanted. Flow - never heard of the word. one second
he'd be spinning some killer hardcore, the next some real pretty
ambient stuff. but of course anything ambient he started with wuz
immediately annihilated w/ some industrial strength beats that came
crashing in. ahhh...the memories! of course doing what he wanted 
when he wanted also meant going to the bathroom - even in the middle
of his set! so there wuz a surprise intermission w/ our very own
Stickman on the wheels of steel as Joel went to drain the ole lizard
(or wuz it to light the pipe?).

i think Exxon wuz next. finally the new skoolahs were appeased as
hard house filled the room. and the circle dancers came into effect.
the future generation showed what it wuz all about and the vibe 
level went up a couple notches. to me dancers are the life of the
party. and i've gotta give props pitt has got some purdy fly 
dancers! who wuz the girl in the pony tail & the yellow windbreaker?
flashes of lisa lee immediately came to mind. the legacy has passed
on. this is what made the trip all worthwhile watchin those crazy
pitt dancers going @ it. it's a pity that dancing has almost become
a thing of the past in cleveland. no dancers = no vibe = no fun =
no party = no scene. new vibe creators have to come up in order for
the scene to evolve. and to let us ole foggys retire. 

both christa and i were getting purdy tired from doing so much 
driving & plus we had a long drive ahead of us so we left soon 
afterwards. but it wuz good seeing some ole pitt faces again:
joel, hossam, rick, joel, john, ruffian, frank, etc.

---

saturday (7/20/96) - NEVERWHERELAND - cleveland, ohio
-----------------------------------------------------

welp christa couldn't come cuz she had to study for summer midterms,
so i ended taking jenny up. i think this wuz the 1st party that
jenny had been to in 9 months (i guess mr. rage didn't let her out
of the house much plus after losing all that money after GROOVERIDE,
it left her a li'l disheartened w/ the scene - speakin o which if
any of u pitt people see dave/guefy remind him he still owes some
one $2000!)

welp got to the party late as usual - 3am - since we had to drive up
from columbus. dropped off the 2ND AGO flyers for rick @ the smart
bar stand. then headed out for the main floor...

i think Glenn Underground wuz spinning...typical cajual/relief hard
house stuff...purdy good...but wanted to check the other rooms...i 
think Nigel Richards wuz spinning some nice acid in the back. and
i got my groove on...when i came back out on the main floor, Dave
Trance wuz spinning some new east coast trance i've never heard
before...i think i spent more time watching him spin than dancing.
went outside to check out the music out there...this wuz actually
my choice spot of the night...right by the dj booth as junglists:
tik tak, sine, and titonton laid down the vinyl...omigawd titonton!
imagine claude young losing alotta weight, growing dreads, and 
spinning jungle! all kindsa tricks: spinning w/ his tongue, his
elbow, behind the back, under the table and never missing a beat!
question: why is titonton not spinning @ Jungle Warfare? answer:
cuz he'd blow away all the competition hands down!

same cleveland venue, same cleveland faces. u may've thought this
party wuz the bomb, pete. but for me it wuz the same ole same ole.
i thought both FA2 & 420 were both higher vibed partys personally.

netters i bumped into @ the party:  Leah aka PebblesOH (sorry 'bout 
pittsburgh!), Scott & Desmond from columbus (my company when i lost
jenny cuz she fell asleep in the bleachers!), Kate (alwaze puts a
sm:)e on my face), jeff & crew doing that stuffy dance, Allroy & his
girl (made me miss my girl), Steve from Centrak actually enjoying
himself rather than having to run around worrying about technical
stuff! Hossam & the pitt kids - i don't think i could've provided u
crash space anywaze cuz i had to take Jenny back to columbus afterwards.

stayed in columbus on sunday, so i missed that night too. even 
missed astroboy @ mekka in columbus that night. i dunno i'm just
not into this party thing as much anymore...purdy anti-social now...
i'm too lazy to even greet people that i know @ partys nowadaze...
i guess i need a break...partying is fine & dandy but nothing
beats spending some quality time w/ people that u are close to... 
helluva lot cheaper too.

Subject: 168 semi review
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

first off, i would like to give my personal thanks to rick
for putting this together like he did.  it's guys like him that
keep scenes movin' and shakin'!!!  also thanks to 168 for 
letting deadly buda and loki melt their speakers......!

first off was phoenix.
i missed his set, and havent' heard him in about 6 months.
he used to be a 'not so good beatmatcher who play the BEST
tracks so his lack of skills was very acceptable' type dj.
i've always been a fan of his because he was spinning hh a 
year and a half ago when absolutely nobody had a clue.
how did he do last night?

then came loki who i also missed (the first time).
i understand that he played a nice hard house/light gabber set.

up next was d.cypol.  my favorite set of the night.
starting off with some breakbeatier happy hardcore, and he slowly
progressed into some harder cheesier stuff that gave me chills
all over!  and to top it off, joe was running around mc'ing with
a cordless mic!  lots of people were dancing all over.
it was a big happy ball of madness!

up next was  deadly buda.  what can i say.
he don't give a damn about nobody's opinions and he mixes
his way and his way only.  i respect that.  he is perhaps the 
most schizophrenic dj i've ever had  the pleasure to hear.
while he lost alot of points in the beatmatching department,
he gained twice that amount in creativity.  for example,
he'd be playing a hard house track, then all of the sudden,
drop in some skinny puppy sounding stuff, then it'd be happy
hardcore.  as soon as you thought he was moving in one direction
with the mix,,,the guy would do a complete u-turn!  the second
half of his set was total speedcore industrial strenght
"fuckin' hostile" evil gabber noise.......and we danced to it!

after buda, loki came on again.  he started off with some 
hard techno, and moved into monstrous gabber very similar to 
buda's.  i left halfway through his set though because i had
to be at work in 4 hours.......(sniff sniff).

anyways, phoenix went on again after loki.
or at least he was scheduled to.
i heard a rumor that he was supposed to spin tagteam with
d.cypol.  did that ever happen???

as for the downstairs....i only walked through there once.
i can't say that the people there were all posers like someone 
said, but the vibe was TOO lazy for me.  but it was supposed
to be like that, so it's cool.  but i came to dance.

without a doubt, my trip to 168 was my BEST club experience
ever!  the question now is:
when is this going to happen again?
the turnout was really great too...probably better than most other
nights at 168.  let's keep this hardcore roller coaster moving!

love,
ryu

Fuck it.  I can never win.  I never said anything bad about the Rewind.  I
never said anything bad about Udg. I never said anything bad about any
Pittsburgh promoters, at least, not individually.  I mean, yes I have
criticized prices, and yes I have wanted only the best for Pittsburgh.  And
I have made suggestions accordingly.  I have never said that what I thought
was the best idea.  I have never slammed somebody elses ideas.  I just don't
seem to fucking fit in.  And that just doesn't make any sense.  I love the
music, I like most of the people (and when I don't I almost always keep my
mouth shut about it.)  I used to love the parties (hell I still do I had a
fucking wicked time at both Tribute and Your 2nd Ago), it just seems that
nobody in Pittsburgh is ever willing to take a risk.  It seems that
everything has to be done in this super secret ultra planned out big scheme
way.  I mean, hell yeah Enit can do a lot for the scene, thats cool.  But
what if it doesn't?  Are we just gonna keep doing things the way they are
done?  Probably.  I wholeheartedly believe that we _can_ have as big a scene
here as other cities.  And I'm sure that the way things are going now we
will.  I wish everyone in Pittsburgh the best of luck.  No, I'm not logging
off or leaving the scene or anything.  I just am totally exasperated and
frustrated.  I will be around, and I'll probably (stupidly) still be as
vocal about my ideas as I have been.  But, as in the past I will never slam
a party or promoter.  Thats not what I'm here to do.  I have not and I will
not.  Anyway... I don't know exactly what the message I'm trying to put out
is, but I just needed to rant my frustrations.  So, I'll see everyone around
for sure... Peace, Love, Unity and Respect  -Count Zer0

Well, if I haven't said it before let me say it now.  Stickman and Fuel (and
the Jive Turkeyz for that matter) know WHAT THE FUCK IS UP.  A wonderful two
room vibe packed dj exploding event in a sweet location with nice happy old
and new schoolers, killer sound, basically what more could you ask for!?  

I went to your 2nd ago not expecting to have the greatest time, because I
just wasn't ready to be in the club 168 atmosphere (or so I thought!) I
mean, I was just kinda worried having never been there before... But a lot
of my friends were there, and the music was kickin hardcooooowahhh! So, I
ended up having a pretty good time, pretty much right up until I left.  

Moral of the story... GO TO FUEL PARTIES.  You wont regret it.  :D

Kibo respect for the aerodynamics on the flyers.  We missed one of them, 
and it cling to the windshield wiper by a corner until like route 8 on 
the way home.

A paper tagwall works well at a rave.  I had one up at a party a few 
months ago (New Years Eve, to be precise), and the tags made the party go 
to the next level.  It's a neat memento to have after a party.  Butcher 
paper is reccomended, as well as using water-based ink markers.

Frank, 

we know you're thinking for the best, but at this point there is no way 
the line-up going to change, but maybe you can focus your efforts on 
putting together an after-party, featuring our favorite--ambient ;) .. 
some nice sunny place, just come up with a 100watt sound system and it'll 
be alright .. all those out-of-towners pitts needs can crash for a little 
bit in a relaxing atmosphere .. 

the party itself will go down just fine with just one space .. <<no 
telling what in form that space will be>> .. as tunnelvision wz one 
system .. jungle itself is very diverse in the type of sounds within the 
genre .. it's not going to be "all the same stuff" all nite long ..   


but you were also trying to open up the town to music it hasn't had much 
exposure too .. and with Mr. Dwight taking the show on the road you were 
worried about opportunities for wide-scale exposure going along with it 
.. i don't know what the right venue for ambient is .. and it may not 
come along, you may have to create your own .. it is a good idea to 
expand the styles of music within the scene .. the more styles, the more 
diverse the listeners, and the larger the crowd .. 


btw ..
damian .. nice set last weekend at LitJ 
your side on ECS is better than the other
and your web page suks ;) .. or somtin .. i guess 

later ..
Sean

Hi all,

I just got back from listening to the Allman Brothers at Nautica in the
Flats here in Cleveland.  You know, I used to love bands like these, the
60's/early 70's thing.  Ya, I've gone to 12 Dead shows and thought the
people were great and that the vibe was about as good as it's going to
get.  But you know what?  Raves are better. 

Granted, 720 didn't have the love of a Family Affair, but it was inside at
an evening-only facility in an urban environment.  Nevertheless, there was
something truly titillating about a rave like 720 that no Allman Brothers
show could never come close to approximating.  Raves are the real deal.
They are the true underground and grass roots expression of creativity,
ingenuity, inspiration and, yes, even love.  From the promoters to the
dj's who spin the magic, to the lighting guys, to the enthusiasts who
religiously trek hundreds of miles to and from shows (in Stevie T's case,
thousands of miles), there is an earnestness that the 60's-esque Dead
stuff doesn't share or perhaps couldn't even understand.  

Frankly, the Allman Brothers are great musically, but the concert was just
another concert.  The 720 show, on the other hand, is something that I'm
going to be thinking about for a long, long time.  It was a celebration
for me.  Plus, the music at 720 was a lot more vital in my opinion than
the 60's/70's thing.  If you want them -- and this is for the promoters --
I think that there are a lot of disenfranchised 20 somethings out there
who have traveled the road of the hippie and are looking for new earth.
The former is merely an ever flagging attempt to imitate something that's
already happened, the latter -- the rave scene -- is genuine and ready to
take off.

Well, just my thoughts . . . I would be interested to know if there are
any others like me out there.  Most of the kids I run into at raves are
really quite young.  And this is uncomfortable for me (it makes me feel
like security sometimes).  How would all of you feel about older 20
somethings suddenly showing up at your shows?

Peace and love,

Braden

Damn, if you thought Buda played some hard tracks *think again* (not that 
his tracks/selections weren't *good*, coz they rocked!).  Right after that 
Loki came on and TOTALLY BASHED MY BRAIN IN!  
Loads of hardcore and breakneck nose-bleed inducin' gabber, the likes of which I'v 
NEVER heard in pittsburgh.  I just wished I wasn't soo tired from all the 
previous dancing. :)  People were very nice all-round, and it's great to 
see hard-core doesn't mean hard-ass-punks, just open minded. :)

Very many props go to 168 and stickman for putting together a class 
hardcore night!! Woo-ha!  There seemed to be more people there than at 
steel-city jungle. {eyes bugging out in insane fashon}

Yes, hardcore is back, in a big way. :P

Ok, I shall now stop typing the word "hardcore", because its annoying as 
hell when someone won't stop ranting on and on about one style of music. :)

have phun all,

We would like to thank everyone who contributed to the IO experience.  People 
deserving thanks are too numerous to list, but a few have gone above and 
beyond and deserve additional recognition for their efforts.  So we give extra 
special shouts out to Drop Bass for years of support and bringing their sound 
system, Antares for promotion efforts, Maxximum for providing all the 
wonderful gear for the mainstage, and of course, JJ who got this whole crazy 
thing started.

Next. some details about the camp site.

We have secured an absolutely unbelievable site.  It features full camping 
facilities including running water and electricity for most of the camp sites, 
nature trails, a SWIMMING pool that will be open during the day, a fantastic 
main stage area in a huge meadow within the woods, plenty of showers, an 
onsite store, and numerous other amenities to make the weekend as enjoyable as 
possible.

Saturday night we are fortunate to have Dr. Seth Shostack from the SETI 
Institute give a presentation on the current progress in the search for extra 
terrestrial intelligence.   IO will be making a major contribution to the SETI 
institute to help fund their efforts.

Hello, everyone! This is Jamie (dj bliss) from Activated Magazine and 
Active Ingredients Productions in Baltimore. I'm just letting everyone 
know about our publication.

Activated is an underground zine for the music and culture of the rave 
scene(s). It's goal is to unite (or at least inform) scenes everywhere 
in the US. We are small right now (only 4,000 copies per issue), but 
things are starting to come together. We send copies to various record 
store, cloting stores, and promotion companies throughout the US. We try 
to cover every area, but our limited budget limits us.

The best thing about Activated is that it's FREE!! Which means that we 
have to rely on advertisement to pay the bills. We have subscriptions 
though: $16 for 12 issues (two years), $9 for 6, $5 for 3, or a trial 
issue for $1.75. Since copies are limited, subscriptions are the only 
way to guarantee that you'll get a copy.

We also need help in the following areas:

 --- we need representatives from cities all over the world to cover 
     their particular area. All we need are scene reports, interviews, 
     updates, etc. on each city/scene. Email us if interested and we'll 
     give you the details.

 --- advertisements are needed! We have REALLY resonable rates. Based on 
     an 8 1/2"x 11" layout, the rates are as follows:
     Business card $25
     1/4 Page $40
     1/2 Page $65
     Full Page $90
     Two Pages $165
     Back Cover $125

--- Promoters: email me with your event announcements. We only need the 
    date, name, production company name, line-up, info line #, and the 
    city that it will be in.

--- DJs: send in mixtapes. We do reviews of tapes/Cds, and sometimes 
    sell tapes through the magazine. Let us know if you're interested in 
    selling it when you send it. we also have a top ten section.

--- Record labels/Artists: send all material in all formats to be 
    reviewed by us in the magazine. 

We need a lot more, but we've wasted enough bandwidth already (sorry!). 
If you're interested in joining the team or just to get copies, please 
contact us through the following methods:

If High Times conveys that its okay to do MDMA, that would not surprise or
challenge my curiosity to intake MDMA.  High Times is a very biased
journal, a "'preaching to the converted' type of reading...waste of
trees.." quothe Molly Campell. But if NYT publishes an article regarding
the benign nature of MDMA, now its pretty much garunteed that's its primary
sources are going to be farther reaching, and more professionally
researched. That's because NYT has a *REPUTATION* for being accurate when
it comes to controversial issues such as drug use, whereas High Times has a
*REPUTATION* for giving drug users reasons to continue using drugs.
        Also, the phrase "peer reviewed journal" bugs me. Does a study on
marijuana use among 14 year olds (That's *just* an example) have to be done
by 14 year olds? Do we need their approval to comment on their drug use???
I don't think so.  Maybe i'm taking its meaning out of context.

People that die at raves usually don't die of overdoses, and one drug in
particular is usually not directly to blame. People die of heat exhaustion
and high fevers, caused by excesses of body heat *PLUS* the fact that E
does raise your body temperature about 2 degrees F (most of you who
probably do E don't know this, which makes this issue more sickening
considering we also had a discussion about education quite recently). They
also die as the result of mixing drugs that shouldn't be mixed. I'm not
saying E can cause you to die, but without this irresponsbile and naive
behavior associated with doing illicit substances, these unfortunate deaths
would not happen. Of course I've never heard of these types of deaths
around the pb-cle area because we don't throw 300,000 people into a stadium
so everyone can have their one square foot of dance space like they do in
Germany.
        That doesn't mean it couldn't happen here, because if it  did OUR
SCENE WOULD DETERIORATE. ALL OF OUR CREATIVE EFFORTS WOULD BE OVERLOOKED.
ALL OF OUR REPUTATIONS WOULD BE AFFECTED. The Germany scene can survive
something like that, but we have no room for IDIOTS who go to parties
primarily for drugs and not music.
        I could give a fuck about people who disrespect the idea that raves
are a celebration of *INTELLIGENCE, CREATIVITY, PROGRESS and UNITY*  If you
feel that doing drugs brings you to a heightened state of any of these
goals, Amen.  But NAIVITE and IGNORANCE have no room at raves. If your
BLISS comes from ignorance, i suggest regressing to a hippie. The hippies
strived on regressing to biological state, oblivious to their communal
intellect and its progress.  These people don't belong at raves. Their only
unity came from their common confusion and isolation.
        My point is, everyone has a contribution to the overall vibe of a
party atmosphere. Seeing a person strung out DOES have an effect on the
overall vibe. But if you think your vibe comes from a drug, your have a
distorted view of your own self. A drug may enhance your ability to share
that vibe, but its something that you always have within you, and always
have the ability to communicate.

While I agree with you about High Times, Pete, I'd just like to point 
something out.  _The New York Times_ has _no_ such reputation for being 
accurate when it comes to controversial issues.  A good starting point, 
if you want to check this out, is to rent the documentary _Manufacturing 
Consent_, a film about Noam Chomsky (anarcho-syndacalist, and my personal 
hero) and his view of the media.  I suggest that everyone on these lists 
rent this movie, in fact...  Chances are, it should illuminate some 
things that are going on even as we speak that you (a general "you") 
might have no idea are going on with the American media.  An excellent 
film indeed.  And entertaining, to boot...  and us ravers like to be 
entertained, am I right?

A peer reviewed journal is a journal which is read (reviewed) by people in 
the same field as those who publish the journal ("peers" of those who do 
the studies, publish the studies, in other words).  When you're writing 
for a bunch of people who are experts in the field you're writing on, 
it's much harder to bullshit, wouldn't you say?

        What's up all!!! I usually don't post anything on here because I
haven't been to a Pitt. Party and I review Ohio parties on MW but I
rememebr a little while ago about how some of the threads said the scene in
Pitt. was dead. I just saw the event calendar and looks like you guys are
alive and well. I'm excited about going to "Visions" or "Golden" but i
don't know too much about the promoters. Will these parties go over? Please
someone respond.

        Shout outs to all of the pitt people I met at 720 this past
weekend. Maybe I'll see you tomorrow night.

Peace,
Des

All very true.  This is why I think that information booths at parties 
are a good idea, information booths that can give kids hardcore, unbiased 
facts.

This I disgaree with.  Scenes don't go kaput because of a few deaths.  
The rave is not going to die, folks.  Shit, someone died at Woodstock...  
Did you see all of the hippies shave their heads and join the army?
Let's take the "worst" case scenario (which I actually tend to think is 
the "best" case scenario):  Kids start dying at parties.  More and more 
younger ravers go to parties, and get into trouble.  Cops start shutting 
down more and more parties.  It becomes harder and harder to throw huge, 
legal parties.  More promoters begin to throw small outlaw events as an 
alternative.  Many of the "idiots" are weeded out of the scene, and only 
those who are down with the outlaw spirit stay into raving.

Uhm, maybe my point of view just isn't the popular one around here, but 
this strikes me as being a _good_ thing...

Now this is complete and utter hooey.  The hippie movement was more 
political than the rave scene ever has been and ever will be, probably 
(although not if I have anything to say for it).  What do you think 
hippies burned their draft cards for, the fun of starting fires?  WHy do 
you think hippies supported the civil rights movement, because it was fun 
to march around in Washington?  Why do you think hippies got shot at the 
Democratic national convention?  The hippie movement was inherently a 
political movement, and in my opinion ravers have much to learn from 
hippies.  Your statement, "The hippies strived on regressing to 
biological state, oblivious to their communal intellect and its 
progress...  Their only unity came from their common confusion and 
isolation", is completely incorrect.  If I were you, I'd do some research 
before I bashed entire cultures that have caused more of an impact on 
America than perhaps any other American subculture in the history of this 
country.

I agree.  That's why if more informed drug users take the responsibilty 
of showing the newer kids what's up, the scene will become much stronger.

[ stuff about High Times preaching to the converted deleted ]

I agree that _High Times_ is probably not a good source to go to for
scientific information.  It is biased.

>That's because NYT has a *REPUTATION* for being accurate when
>it comes to controversial issues such as drug use, whereas High Times has a
>*REPUTATION* for giving drug users reasons to continue using drugs.

But the person who writes the science section has a general
knowledge of science, but is not particularly versed in specific
areas and may not give a proper interpretation of the "real
deal".  Basically, the science writer reads his copies of _Science_
and _Nature_ (which he gets before the general population) and picks 
out what he thinks people will want to hear about.  He then tries to 
write an article that others will both understand and find interesting.  
A lot can get lost in the mix. Yes, it is reputable and trustworthy, but 
it is still a secondary source that is written to sell newspapers.  

For example, if he writes an article based on some study on MDMA
that found neurotoxicity in rats, he's basically going to say -
"Researchers at Johns Hopkins University found evidence of neurotoxicy
in rats that were administered MDMA, the popular street drug ecstasy.  
The serotinin levels were measured via 5-HIAA and 5-HT metabolites

reduced level of these indicators which suggests neuron damage."  Or 
something like this. What's neglected is the dosage, method of 
administration, the translation to humans (which he would very likely
speculate on), and the accuracy of the indicators.

Now _Science News_, although a secondary source, is probably a little
more reliable since *all* they report is science and have several
writers that have several specialties. 

>Also, the phrase "peer reviewed journal" bugs me.

"peer reviewed journal" has a very precise meaning - that is,
that the studies are reviewed by other scientists before (and
after by way of OP-EDs) being published.  Examples of peer reviewed 
journals are JAMA (Journal of the American Meidical Association), 
Science, Nature, Journal of Molecular Biology, Journal of
Neurochemistry, JPET (I always forget what it stands for - Journal 
of Pharmacology and Exprerimental Therapy?), etc.  Basically any
study that is scientific is published in some type of peer
reviewed journal (the peers are other scientists).  I hope this 
clears things up.

Thanks for the correction.  I didn't mean to say that the point
doesn't have the ability to speak ;-).

actually, from research i have done, i think the rave scene and the 
"hippie" scene have one remarkable similarity - though there may have 
been an ideological thread... most of the people weren't taking part in 
the scene for the politics, and the politicized in the scene resented that.

 What do you think

yes. they were ll pyromaniacs. or maybe they didn't need draft cards, 
because they had cushy connections in the Reserves. oh no, wait. THAT 
would be the political leaders of today's America...

most hippies didn't march in civil rights movements. i am not sure where 
you got this info or idea. the BOLD majority of civil rights marchers 
were black. no two ways about that one. lets not start rewriting an 
important history for the sake of a point.

people who resented their smell? people with an irrational fear of

nothing is inherently anything, in my opinion. any sum is the whole of

okay... i have this awesome mental picture of this 12 year old with a 
syringe, and he keeps missing his veins... finally, this older, wiser 
junkee walks over, and lovingly says "no, son. smack your arm HERE to 
bring out the veins." it's really touching, and as the scene fades from

The hippies who sold out their belief system and voted for Regan, or 
commited some other crime against humanity, I would equate to all of the 
dumbass ravers who are into the scene and really have no care in the 
world for a sense of "raver community", who abuse drugs, and who place 
fashion first, character second.  These hippies equate to all of the 
promoters who are in it solely for the money, the promoters who charge 
more than one dollar for water, the promoters who call the cops on other 
promoters, etc. etc.

The hippie movement was overwhelmingly more political in nature than the 
rave scene.  Disagree if you must -- you are still flat-out incorrect.

There were many, Many, MANY supporters of the Civil Rights Movement who 
were not black.  And wait a second, Bill... all hippies were white?  Many 
hippies supported minorities and minority causes throughout the sixties.

Actually, Bill, they were practicing their rights.  I believe they're 
called "Freedom of Speech" and "Freedom of Assembly"...  maybe you've 
heard of them?

Sure,a hell of a lot of hippies sold out.  My mom is one of them, and 
shit, she's even in the video of Woodstock!  The hippie movement changed 
many things in America, however.  Hippies got people to question the 
rationale of the Vietnam War, for example.  Tim Leery's ideas, whether 
accepted or not, definitely got many people to change the way they viewed 
society.  Abbie Hoffman.  Lots of hippie bands were (and still are) very 
leftist in nature, and very vocal about political issues.

Of course, ravers _have_ accomplished this much, right?

I do research all of the time.  It's what I love to do.  I'm big into 
learning new things, and big into being exposed to new ideas.  New 
ideas...  think about that before you fight it.

Bill, you are infinitely funny.  However, this is hardly what I was 
referring to, and you know it.  Humor has its place, to be sure, but so 
does rationale debate.

Not at all, Bill... It was just wrong.

ATTN::: The following is not a rip on Stickman or SaraS (who by the way 
wrote a brilliant post, and i thank her for it) by any means...just havin 
phun (and being a little sardonic at the end but hey it's all good)

I think we should change the lists to horse lists.  

Possible flame wars:
You fucking idiot!  I told you to use linseed oil on your saddle, not 
soybean oil!  You obviously don't deserve to be around horses.  You lack 
the vibe.

I think the spirit of horseback riding really can't be enjoyed by young 
kids.  All that stuff you read about in books is a bunch of BS.  Kids 
just can't handle the excitement of going 15 miles/hour.  Plus I hear 
they get high on the horses' tranquilizers on the side.  Fuckups.  :P

I wish you people would stop flaming each other so I don't have to go to 
the trouble of hitting delete...don't you have anything better to do, 
like french braid your horse's hair or wipe the manure out of your ass????

Possible OT posts:

Maybe this won't be of interest to anyone here, but there's a rave 3 
fridays from now. the line up is....  The location is around.....  the 
promoters and lights and sound and smartbaar ppl are....

hey jockBoi and all others on this list who wanted to know, that choon id 
u wanted was....

Hey cyberriders.  I have a review of a really fat promo I got.  It's 
rippin highstep, higher than a Cleidesdale yo.....

I know this is OT, but has anyone every ridden a camel?  Last week I saw 
this girl riding a camel just right so it was like she was  masturbating in 
public...she *came* right the fuck in front of my face.  And at that point 
I was really eager to dip my candy thing in the powdered sugar stuff, so 
I drank 57,874,700 oz of Colt 45 with shot of grnadine and a little 
umbrella on top and tried to get with her...but I smelled like shit (cuz 
I had fallen in some camel manure after eating 5 hits and a 
Fillet-o-Fish) so she wasn't havin' it.  But since my ride deserted me 
she decided to give me a ride home on her camel.  

fuck everybody and lots of love,

well, i personally wouldn't mind at all.
in fact, i'd be happy to see some older people attending raves.
i, at the tender age of 20, sometimes feel old when 
surrounded by so many younger gals and guys....

Calling all Clevelanders and others interested in a different perspective, 

Braden Albert recently wrote about an Allman Bros. concert and 720, comparing
the latter favorably, and wondering about attitudes of the younger crowd
toward older partygoers.

Here's a story (or 2) from an aging raver:

I saw the Allmans for the first and last time in the late spring or early
summer of 1971 at Musicarnival, an in-the-round tent venue in Warrensville
Heights. I was an usher for a concert production outfit called A Friend,
formed by a Belkin Brothers defector named Roger Abramson to challenge their
monopoly on the Kleveburg music scene.  As an usher, I got a cool T-shirt
with a W.C. Fields logo, saw the shows (among others, Soft Machine) for free
and was paid $5 a night. 

The Allman Brothers were then in their prime, and the show was a joy.

Various substances got passed around among the ushers, and probably as a
result, my co-usher and bandmate at the time (now an influential Clevelander
who will remain semi-anonymous) got lost driving us back to the West Side. We
didn't get home till around 2, and this was a school (high school) night. 

There was hell to pay. 

When Jim asked his father, Arthur, to borrow the car again for the next
Sunday's show, the answer was no. "But it's Pink Floyd," Jim protested. "I
don't care if it's Orange Eddie, you're not going!" Arthur concluded.

We missed Floyd, but got the car for subsequent gigs.

About six months later, Duane Allman was dead. Musicarnival lasted another
year or two (it's probably a shopping center or parking lot now) and A Friend
faded from the scene after some notable shows at the Allen Theater, the CWRU
campus and elsewhere.

On to 720... 

I hadn't been to the old WHK Auditorium (aka, circa 1969,  the Grande
Cleveland, now at least the third Agora location) since I was probably 7
years old. It's still a grand and historic place, with hints of elegance,
though not an ideal place for a dance party.

I came to Neverwhereland almost directly from hearing the Cleveland Orchestra
do its rain-abbreviated set Sunday night in the Flats, and had been looking
forward to 720 all weekend. But no one at the door, or the bar, or wearing an
Agora T-shirt knew the lineup. (Props here to Stevie T, who had e-mailed me
the full listing before I departed from D.C. for the weekend.)

At the venue, Desmond from Columbus filled me in on the previous two nights,
when the other room and  jungle alley were in operation, giving the
event--and the ancillary parties--a very favorable review. 

When I was there Sunday night (actually, early Monday), the big room was
pounding with some hard stuff. The DJ (can someone help me here with a
handle?) later mixed in a Martin Luther King speech, skillfully dropping out
the drums and bass at times. The lighting was interesting, and got better as
the morning went on, but not overwhelming. I was hoping for some projections.

There were more people seated or hanging out in the lobby than dancing, but
it was still early, maybe 1:15, and a lot of folks were probably still at
Trilogy. The side room was empty except for a table of people drinking, and
the AC there was on at an uncomfortable full blast, giving a new meaning to
chillout. 

I was looking for a jungle space, or at least an ambient room, but because
this was the wind-down, discount night of the event, I guess, there was
neither. 

My wife, whom I had persuaded to attend, was not enjoying herself. She had
left the District of Chaos several days before I had, to attend a funeral.
She had some heavy family things on her mind that morning, and privately
criticized the rave kids in attendance as conformists. Eventually I got tired
of looking at her frown. So we left relatively early.

Though she is close friends with many prominent people in the DC punk-rock
community (she heads a food co-op that involves many of them), the rave scene
turned her off. 

Oh well. How do you explain it? It's not for everyone. 

On to the age issue...

I've been to Buzz, Fever and Sting parties in DC and Baltimore, an Ultraworld
mega-event, a one-off in Fayetteville, N.C. (home of Fort Bragg!) and jungle
nights in a DC club and have never felt uncomfortable --  despite the fact
that I'm pushing 42, going gray in the beard and getting a little thin on
top. Ditto for club events with Orbital, Moby and Sun Ra. 

The thing about rave crowds, at least in the DC-Balmer area, is that they're
diverse. Black, white, Latino, Asian, straight and gay, urban and suburban,
young and old -- they're all there to share a good time and dig the music,
not to make judgments. 

Similarly, I've never felt uncomfortable (nor has my 40-something spouse)
going out to hear Fugazi, Tsunami or other stars of the DC punk scene.  

So my advice to Braden is: Enjoy yourself, have a good time. Connect with
others if you want to, but feel good by yourself. Respect is a mutual
proposition; when when it happens, Unity, Love and Peace more easily follow.

One last note: In the pre-psychedelic '60s, the WHK jingle was: "WHK, color
channel 14, color radio!" 

PLUR and Om, Keith aka fortyfast@aol.com aka fastforty

	Hey now don't knock it.....I love horse music! I remember back in the 
day when parties were at old, empty amish stables! Pretty cool. 
	They were great until the Amish got wind of it demanded that we 
remove the 'satanic technology' from their farms. After that we started 
breaking into racetracks late at night and had 'horse parties' in the 
center field of the track. Sometimes the jockeys would run the horses 
around the track while the party was going. 
	That all broke up when kids started to snort oats and carry salt 
licks around their necks. Ah well.....

Toby asked me,

> Where do you come from, girl? :-)  Sometimes your posts are too far out!  

I come from the land of milk and honey.

Re: that segment about the camel, I guess I should explain to pbcle that 
it was a parody of a post on ne-raves.  I thought it had gone to pb-cle, 
but maybe it didn't.  That's why it might have seemed completely out of 
the blue.

goodbye, and thank you for your support.
;)

i think that would still be (at least for me) a bad case scenario. i
don't want parties to get shut down (well duh, who does?), but i like
huge parties. not that small parties are bad: they are fun too, but
when they are so big, they are different. a lot of things that i like
about big parties don't happen at small parties + vice versa. i
think they both have their place. also i've heard about people getting
arrested for just being at an illegal party. that really scares me
especially since if i get anything at all else on my record (i didn't
kill anybody or something like that (!), i just have some sort of
misdemeanor for drinking) i can't go into the military & then i would
have no idea what to do with my life. anyway, apparently i need to be
super-careful. i also would say that if more parties are illegal, we
will get even less respect than the little we already have from
mainstream society. not that i am in favor of raves themselves
befoming mainstream + endorsed by mtv + all the "alterna-teen" types
of people going to parties just because they think it's the thing to
do--but i do think that we should get as much respect from cops, the 
media, parents, etc. as anybody else.

Man, I'm really happy this thread came up...

Man, I remember back in the day when we used to groove to the wikked 
equine sounds of DJ Horse (from Filly) a few years back... His shit 
rocked HARD!  I remember having to scout out the proper feed store for 
the correct map point.. damn that was really underground.  But yes, like 
you said, I was really pissed off with the oat abuse.  That was bad as it 
was, but hay, don't forget about how once the barn events got more and 
more commercial, SUPERSTAR DJ HORSE became a Ketamine addict.  Everything 
went downhill after that, and I had to hang my saddle back on the hook, 
if you get my drift.

Oh, the memories... *sniff*

     Good Hardware
     
     KABINDA, ZAIRE--In a move IBM offices are hailing as a major step in 
     the company's ongoing worldwide telecommunications revolution, M'wana 
     Ndeti, a member of Zaire's Bantu tribe, used an IBM global uplink 
     network modem yesterday to crush a nut.
     
     Ndeti, who spent 20 minutes trying to open the nut by hand, easily   
     cracked
     it open by smashing it repeatedly with the powerful modem.
     
     "I could not crush the nut by myself," said the 47-year-old Ndeti, who 
     added the savory nut to a thick, peanut-based soup minutes later. 
     "With IBM's help, I was able to break it." Ndeti discovered the 
     nut-breaking, 28.8 V.34 modem yesterday, when IBM was shooting a 
     commercial in his southwestern Zaire village. During a break in 
     shooting, which shows African villagers eagerly teleconferencing via 
     computer with Japanese schoolchildren, Ndeti snuck onto the set and 
     took the modem, which he believed would serve well as a "smashing" 
     utensil.
     
     IBM officials were not surprised the longtime computer giant was able 
     to provide Ndeti with practical solutions to his everyday problems. 
     "Our telecommunications systems offer people all over the world global 
     networking solutions that fit their specific needs," said Herbert 
     Ross, IBM's director of marketing. "Whether you're a nun cloistered in 
     an Italian abbey or an Aborigine in Australia's Great Sandy Desert, 
     IBM has the ideas to get you where you want to go today."
     
     According to Ndeti, of the modem's many powerful features, most   
     impressive
     was its hard plastic casing, which easily sustained several minutes of 
     vigorous pounding against a large stone. "I put the nut on a rock, and 
     I hit it with the modem," Ndeti said. "The modem did not break. It is 
     a   
     good
     modem."
     
     Ndeti was so impressed with the modem that he purchased a new, 
     state-of- the-art IBM workstation, complete with a PowerPC 601 
     microprocessor, a quad-speed internal CD-ROM drive and three 16-bit 
     ethernet networking connectors. The tribesman has already made good 
     use of the computer system, fashioning a gazelle trap out of its 
     wires, a boat anchor out of the monitor and a crude but effective 
     weapon from its mouse.
     
     "This is a good computer," said Ndeti, carving up a just-captured   
     gazelle
     with the computer's flat, sharp internal processing device.  "I am 
     using every part of it. I will cook this gazelle on the keyboard." 
     Hours   
     later,
     Ndeti capped off his delicious gazelle dinner by smoking the 
     computer's 200-page owner's manual.
     
     IBM spokespeople praised Ndeti's choice of computers. "We are pleased  
      
     that
     the Bantu people are turning to IBM for their business needs," said 
     company CEO William Allaire. "From Kansas City to Kinshasa, IBM is 
     bringing the world closer together. Our cutting-edge technology is 
     truly creating a global village."

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While I see no reason at the moment why I wouldn't be able to play at this
party, I have yet to be asked by any promoter to do so.  This is the second
time this has happened to me recently (where I find out that I have been
booked for a party (by seeing a preflyer) before I was asked to spin it)
Now, don't get me wrong, as of now it appears I should be able to play this
night.  However, what if I weren't able to? What if I didn't want to?  I
hope someone from Holdsome or N'sync gets in touch with me soon so we can
work out the details.  But, for now, I am saying that, yes, I most likely
will play at this party.  :)  -Count Zer0

The Beehive often has it's fill of them and is  a common drop spot 
for alot of flyers in general.

You might also check out Jerry's records.  Have not been there lately 
but expect they have a few too.

yeah, the only Jerry's records is now in Squirrel Hill (just found a 91' 
record comp called Strictly Underground:The true ravers album, with some 
old style hardcore/breakbeat by DJ Hype)  

Jerry's CDs is still in oakland, but I'v not seen rave flyers in there in 
a while.

There is however a techno record shop on the same street as the Comics 
crypt and Dave & Andy's - i think atwood.  It's called 'Goodvibes'.  Lots 
of flyers there.  Of course I haven't been there in over a month, so...it 
could be gone...

l8s,

Last night I had the task of finding and then being a part of what I 
thought was going to be a nice small party.  It turned out to be much 
bigger and better than I expected.  Anyways I wanted to say that 
although things were going a little weird (due to the city of 
Pittsburgh's reputation to throw all permits and other legal measures 
to the side when dealing with raves) Phil was the most professional 
acting promoter I have ever dealt with.  I hope people appriciate him 
trying to pull off the whole free party in a park thing.  I also want 
to scold people who planned on merely going to the pre-party and then 
leaving.  When a promoter is willing to throw a free event and then 
on top of that throw a dirt-cheap $12 party with good djs, lights, 
and kick-ass sound.  People need to support that in order to ensure 
more future quality parties. My props go out to Phil for: a. his 
professionalistic ways
                b. the fact that he cares about making things fun as 
apposed to making money
                c. for not having a psychotic break under the 
circumstances of his party
                d. (and most importantly) because he supports fast-
paced techno djs but throws a party with                     
versitality in music
If you get the chance give phil a "thank you" ; phil don't get 
discouraged, I've seen way worse (the whole Local 13 happiness thing) 


sincerely, d.CYPOL

p.s. much thanks to the people gettin' down, I couldn't see the crowd 
but joe told me it was kickin'

well.. what can i say. i feel very sorry for everyone who missed this event.
t-1000 came, and destroyed. he rocked so hard, its was unreal. the man is
master of the turntables, hitting hard with pure techno sounds.
for those who don't know. T-1000 is one of the "gods" of the detroit style.
he knows what good music is, and knows how to mix to make the crowed go wild
[or the small crowd there was]
there we're a bunch of people, but they seem to run in fear when some one
pulled some REAL TECHNO outa their record bag.
i think one quote from T-1000 says it all.
"don't let anyone tell you no bullshit, this is what techno is suppost to
sound like." witch are words that rung true. 
leaving me underly confused at why pittsburgh does not understand what techno
is.
witch leads me to another thought for the night.
Smoov[mark, the "manager" of cafe 168, and plotter of all steel citys/coffe
breaks/ and dub] wanted to say, "hey! thanks for supporting your scene, all
49 people who came. thanks alot.
hey, so when 168 closes in a month, don't ask why."

i think true words. for those who came, and danced there ass's right of
[shouts to erin] and yelled tell they couldn't, will remeber this as the
finest showing of PHAT TOONS ever in pittsburgh. i have more fun @ this then
i did @ 420.
and 420 was fat as hell. it doesn't have to be big to fucking rock. 
suppostly T-1000 is coming back sometime to the burgh. and for all who missed
him this time, i hope you do not do so again.
unless you just don't like techno, and is only conserned about looking/being
cool.

later.
bleep

ps. just for the record, for those lucky few who went [if your even on this
list] i was the jumping, scream, and head bangin' loon in all green.

awhile back i had posted about how a few cleveland ravers were a bit
'turned off' by Turned On's newly raised price of admittance. anyways
i decided to give mr. curtain the benefit of the doubt and talked w/
him on the phone explaining to him about how a few cleveland kids 
were displeased with the price for such a small club (much like how
i had approached mr. sherwood after the gassing @ Next Exit). He
told me that a few ravers that had come into the club had abused the
property: tagging the bathrooms and kicking holes in the wall. subsequently
the price of admittance was increased to cover for the damages. and as
a result you now have to be 19 or older to enter the club.

bottom line: don't be an idiot and disrespect the property or one way
or another you and the scene will have to pay for it.

spinning this thursday @ Turned On will be:

DJ Terence Parker (Detroit)
DJ Yush (Cleveland)

Turned On info # is: 216.556.3962

respects,

Actually, Teleropa and Avalon on Forbes Ave. in Oakland tend to have 
lots 'o Rave Flyers.  Teleropa has them on a table in their looby, and 
Avalon tends to have them on these wooden shelves at the top of the 
steps...

               Directions:

               From the south:
               Take I-95 north.  Exit at I-395, then take the
               exit to Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.  Take King
               Boulevard until it ends at Howard Street (remain in
               one of the middle lanes of King Boulevard to avoid
               a premature forced right or left turn). Turn left
               at Howard Street and proceed about 2 miles. One
               block past 29th Street (where Howard Street becomes
               Art Museum Drive), turn left at the traffic island
               (just before the Baltimore Museum of Art) onto Wyman
               Park Drive. Take an almost immediate right through the
               university gates.  Follow directions below.

               From the north:
               Take I-95 south to 695 (Baltimore beltway) west.  Take
               the beltway toward Towson to exit 25. Take Charles
               Street south for about 7 miles (when Charles Street
               splits a block after Loyola College and Cold Spring
               Lane, take the right fork). As you approach the
               university and cross University Parkway, continue
               southbound but be sure to jog right onto the service
               road. After you pass the university on the right, turn
               right onto Art Museum Drive. Just after the Baltimore
               Museum of Art, bear right at the traffic island onto
               Wyman Park Drive.  Take an almost immediate right
               through the university gates. Follow directions below.

               From Baltimore City:
               Take Charles Street north to 29th.  Make a left on 29th,
               and immediately get in the right lane.  You will see a
               fork in the road, veer right.  You will go around a
               curve to the right, and then merge with traffic heading
               north.  Immediately after merging, you will turn left
               onto Wyman Park drive.  Take an almost immediate right
               through the university gates. Follow directions below.

               Once on the campus:
               There will be brick buildings on the right and a parking
               lot and a field on the left.  Drive past the parking lot
               and the field and make a left just after passing the
               square building on the left.  Make a right at the first
               opportunity.  You will go down hill and under a bridge.
               As you go up and reach the top of the hill on the other
               side of the bridge, there will be a paking lot on the left.
               Park here.  The party will be located on the other side of
               the building that runs parallel to the lot.

               Hope to see you there!

               the members of VIBE

	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police...they're a fun bunch of 
chaps...anybody have any experience with them at The Building??
	Drugs are the main reason I'm not going. I don't care who is 
doing them, I just don't want to spend the weekend in a Canadian jail.

Hello from New York City.  This message is being posted to many many 
mailing lists so apoligies for the massive crosspost.

I am having quite a large used vinyl mail order sale.  I'm talking hundereds of 
records.  I've been working on the master list all summer and it's almost ready 
to go out.  There is so much there it's hard to know where to begin.

I'm selling all kinds of house music (deep, garage, tribal, vocal, 
comercial, etc), all kinds of techno (chicago, detroit, acid, trance, 
etc), ambient, some jungle, triphop, euro, slow breaks, old school rave, 
hip house, freestyle, even some hiphop and r&b thrown in.  Given the number of 
titles on the list, it's most probable that something you're looking for 
is there.  If you want a copy of the list sent to you, please make your 
request via PRIVATE e-mail to:

ddrazen@liii.com

and I will forward the list to you.  I have not assigned prices to the 
records I am selling.  Instead I am taking the highest bids for them.  If 
you're the only one who wants a certain title we'll work out the price 
individually.

I especially have many titles from the following lables:  Freeze, 
Eightball, Strictly Rhythm, Cajual, Emotive, After Dark, etc... you get 
the idea.  Plus there are lots of imports (non-U.S.). All records are in 
excellent condition.

please respond to ddrazen@liii.com.

thanks!
