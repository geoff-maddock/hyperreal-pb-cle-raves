Subject: So...events in pb-cle these days?

At one point Facebook was more useful for finding good local events.  I don'=
t see it being nearly as useful these days - information overload and the si=
gnal to noise ratio is poor.

I don't get out as often as I once did, but when I do I try to find fun even=
ts with good music.  Sometimes I'll go to events that have good musical tale=
nt but are hardly 'parties'. =20

I really enjoy the vibe of "Electrocrunk", a monthly here in Pittsburgh ever=
y first Thursday of the month.  I go to the BBT for "Fuzz" when the DJ is pl=
aying a genre of interest to me (I.e the 2 step throwback Tom Cox did earlie=
r this year there).  There were some one-off events a while back at "935 Her=
ron Ave", a spot above the Polish Club(?) - they were fun.  Technoir/pittsbu=
rgh track authority/Humanaut throw good events. =20

I hear the raves here are different in many ways from the last I attended (2=
004?)- just different demographic and different interaction.

I'd love to hear good suggestions or comments on pb-cle area events - club n=
ights, raves, general parties.=

<ears up>

I landed in the Burningman end of the scene, which was great until
2009ish... when dubstep took over.  Entirely.  It's great tossed into a
set, but it's the equivalent of going to a Phish concert if you're stuck
listening to a couple of sets of it in a row, back to back to back.

Glad to hear about anything else going on, rave or otherwise; I just want
to hear some dance music before 11 pm.

I've heard there are good happy hour events in SF.  They go from 6-10.  I we=
nt to a great happy hour event on a Thursday night when I was in Seattle ear=
lier this year.

I haven't heard about anything like that around here, but I would go if ther=
e were!  I've thought of arranging one myself...to fill the void. =20

* there may well exist these types of events, but they would be likely lost i=
n the aforementioned Facebook noise.

I hear the raves here are different in many ways from the last I attended (=

iamretardedtwo asked what i've been up to...
=A0
after moving from ohio to california in 2003, i made an ambassador mission =
to japan
and china to help get both countries to invest in america (approx. $300 bil=
lion from
japan and over $700 billion from=A0china) to help bail america out of a maj=
or defecit. later
SNL mocked this with a skit they did about a chinese interpretor asking oba=
ma if
he wanted to do him up the butt for screwing china out of so much money and
still not paying it back yet.
=A0
i helped get LOVE PARADE SF going in 2004 by deeming it a celebration party=
 for=20
the anniversary for the UN. as a result, like FAMILY AFFAIR in ohio, i was =
able to
promote the event to=A0multiple countries. the first LOVE PARADE SF had ove=
r
34,000=A0peeps. the=A02008 now named LOVE FEST SF had over 100,000 peeps
from all over the world. my little brother lars fisher from germany, who us=
ed to
DJ on WRUW with me as well as SMART BAR in cleveland, used to tell me about
LOVE PARADE in germany all the time. LOVE PARADE holds the largest attendan=
ce
record with 1.6 million peeps=A0in 2008. for more info, check:=20
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Parade
=A0
i also helped kick off several movies while i've been in california, but th=
at is another
story.

I've heard there are good happy hour events in SF. =A0They go from 6-10. =
=A0I went to a great happy hour event on a Thursday night when I was in Sea=
ttle earlier this year.


I haven't heard about anything like that around here, but I would go if the=
re were! =A0I've thought of arranging one myself...to fill the void. =A0


* there may well exist these types of events, but they would be likely lost=
 in the aforementioned Facebook noise.

I hear the raves here are different in many ways from the last I attended (=
2004?)- just different demographic and different interaction.

I'd love to hear good suggestions or comments on pb-cle area events - club =
nights, raves, general parties.

=A0
after moving from ohio to california in 2003, i made an ambassador mission =
to japan
and china to help get both countries to invest in america (approx. $300 bil=

SNL mocked this with a skit they did about a chinese interpretor asking oba=

he wanted to do him up the butt for screwing china out of so much money and
still not paying it back yet.

the anniversary for the UN. as a result, like FAMILY AFFAIR in ohio, i was =

I've heard there are good happy hour events in SF. =A0They go from 6-10. =
=A0I went to a great happy hour event on a Thursday night when I was in Sea=
ttle earlier this year.


I haven't heard about anything like that around here, but I would go if the=
re were! =A0I've thought of arranging one myself...to fill the void. =A0


* there may well exist these types of events, but they would be likely lost=
 in the aforementioned Facebook noise.

I hear the raves here are different in many ways from the last I attended (=
2004?)- just different demographic and different interaction.

I'd love to hear good suggestions or comments on pb-cle area events - club =
nights, raves, general parties.

here is an old post i made about oscars secrets revealed...

1. after my people crossed the land bridge to be eskimos over 4000
=A0 =A0 years ago, they migrated south to be native american indians, who
=A0 =A0 also started the poker games in saloons patterned after the old
=A0 =A0 ma-jong rooms of chinatown in san francisco, california 1800's.
=A0 =A0 my people built the chinese theatre in 1927 as a means to attract

=A0 =A0 more people to move out west purseing dreams of making it big
=A0 =A0 on the big screen. the theatre was patterned after the temple of th=
e=20
=A0 =A0 chinese emperor. i am related to one of the earliest chinese empero=
rs=20
=A0 =A0 when they were known as hwong dee, chosen messengers of God, a=20
=A0 =A0 direct descendent of shem, who was blessed by noah and traveled to=
=20
=A0 =A0 the mount of the east 5000 years ago to start the chinese royal lin=
e.
=A0=A0 chinese theatre started 4000 years ago to tell the stories of previo=
us
=A0 =A0 emperors.


2. the first show in the chinese theatre was 'king of kings' by cecil b. =
=A0
=A0 =A0 demille telling the story of jesus in jerusalem, who was callled=20
=A0 =A0 king of the jews. the root of david has to do with the blood line
=A0 =A0 of jesus that goes back to david, moses before he, jacob before
=A0 =A0 he, abraham before he, and shem way before he, son of noah.
=A0 =A0 my line started 33 generations before jesus. so yes, i would be=20
=A0 =A0 the missing 'king of kings' of the chinese theatre that was also
=A0 =A0 prophesized in revelation: of the seven churches which are in
=A0 =A0 asia, the most important is the 8th, the one that was, the one
=A0 =A0 that is, the one that goeth into perdition, not by choice but by
=A0 =A0 prophecy for final judgement. a king treated like a prisoner, but
=A0 =A0 how you treat this least of the kingdom of heaven, you shall be
=A0 =A0 treated. the least of the kingdom of heaven shall be greater than
=A0 =A0 john. and a little one shall lead them.


3. one of universal's earliest successful films was 'charlie chan'
=A0 =A0 based on a real honolulu chinese detective in the 1920's. it=A0
=A0 =A0 was later bought by the FOX franchise that also made successful
=A0 =A0 films with the very popular character. the asian detective was a
=A0 =A0 do gooder at a time when crime was prevalent after WWI due
=A0 =A0 to the great depression. in hollywood, stars were targeted by =A0=
=A0
=A0 =A0 dark tare criminals who robbed VIPs at gun point. the competition
=A0 =A0 amongst actresses grew fierce as well when black dalia, an ealy
=A0 =A0 black actress was killed by jealous white female actresses who
=A0 =A0 failed to get the part. so they grabbed her and threw her in front
=A0 =A0 of train track and she was sliced in half by the train. her death
=A0 =A0 was only surpassed by the death of george reeves, who played
=A0 =A0 superman at the time for most famous deaths of that era.


4. one of jack nicholson's earliest films was 'chinatown', where
=A0 =A0 he plays a detective investigating the aristocratic lives of the
=A0 =A0 rich in san francisco, california at the time. this was the film
=A0 =A0 that helped insire verhooven's infamous 'basic instinct' film
=A0 =A0 with michael douglas and sharon stone that catapulted both
=A0 =A0 their careers and resurrected the club industry that fell a bit
=A0 =A0 after the disco days of john travolta in saturday night live
=A0 =A0 when an older woman overdosed on an eightball of cocaine
=A0 =A0 and studio 54 was shut down. cocaine killed the club industry
=A0 =A0 until house and techno music coupled with the sexual liasons
=A0 =A0 depicted in the film 'basic instinct' brought it back in the late=
=20
=A0 =A0 80's and early 90's.


5. bernardo bertolucci did the film 'the last emperor' about allegedly
=A0 =A0 the last chinese emperor. generally regarded as one of the best
=A0 =A0 films ever made by an italian. it nominated for nine academy awards=
.
=A0 =A0 an oscar record at the time. as a result, many italian american
=A0 =A0 directors like martin scorsese and quentin tarantino made films
=A0 =A0 based on asian originals which finally got them oscar nominations
=A0 =A0 and wins.=20


6. not only is my line the true root of david line, i grew up in rootstown,
=A0 =A0 ohio. where i was known as a child prodigy designing hospitals in
=A0 =A0 lego in kindergarten, preaching at 6, visited by italian bishops fr=

secrets revealed...<BR></DIV>
<DIV>1. after my people crossed the land bridge to be eskimos over 4000</DI=
V>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; years ago, they migrated south to be native american ind=
ians, who</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; also started the poker games in saloons patterned after =
the old</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; ma-jong rooms of chinatown in san francisco, california =
1800's.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; my people built the chinese theatre in 1927 as a means t=
o attract<BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; more people to move out west purseing dreams of making i=
t big</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; on the big screen. the theatre was patterned after the t=
emple of the </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; chinese emperor. i am related to one of the earliest chi=
nese emperors </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; when they were known as hwong dee, chosen messengers of =
God, a </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; direct descendent of shem, who was blessed by noah and t=
raveled to </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; the mount of the east 5000 years ago to start the chines=
e royal line.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp; chinese theatre started 4000 years ago to tell the storie=
s of previous</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; emperors.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>2. the first show in the chinese theatre was 'king of kings' by cecil =
b. &nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; demille telling the story of jesus in jerusalem, who was=
 callled </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; king of the jews. the root of david has to do with the b=
lood line</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; of jesus that goes back to david, moses before he, jacob=
 before</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; he, abraham before he, and shem way before he, son of no=
ah.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; my line started 33 generations before jesus. so yes, i w=
ould be </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; the missing 'king of kings' of the chinese theatre that =
was also</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; prophesized in revelation: of the seven churches which a=
re in</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; asia, the most important is the 8th, the one that was, t=
he one</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; that is, the one that goeth into perdition, not by choic=
e but by</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; prophecy for final judgement. a king treated like a pris=
oner, but</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; how you treat this least of the kingdom of heaven, you s=
hall be</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; treated. the least of the kingdom of heaven shall be gre=

<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; john. and a little one shall lead them.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>3. one of universal's earliest successful films was 'charlie chan'</DI=

<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on a real honolulu chinese detective in the 1920's=
. it&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; was later bought by the FOX franchise that also made suc=
cessful</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; films with the very popular character. the asian detecti=

<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; do gooder at a time when crime was prevalent after WWI d=
ue</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; to the great depression. in hollywood, stars were target=
ed by &nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; dark tare criminals who robbed VIPs at gun point. the co=
mpetition</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; amongst actresses grew fierce as well when black dalia, =
an ealy</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; black actress was killed by jealous white female actress=
es who</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; failed to get the part. so they grabbed her and threw he=
r in front</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; of train track and she was sliced in half by the train. =
her death</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; was only surpassed by the death of george reeves, who pl=
ayed</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; superman at the time for most famous deaths of that era.=
</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>4. one of jack nicholson's earliest films was 'chinatown', where</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; he plays a detective investigating the aristocratic live=
s of the</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; rich in san francisco, california at the time. this was =
the film</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; that helped insire verhooven's infamous 'basic instinct'=
 film</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; with michael douglas and sharon stone that catapulted bo=
th</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; their careers and resurrected the club industry that fel=
l a bit</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; after the disco days of john travolta in saturday night =
live</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; when an older woman overdosed on an eightball of cocaine=
</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; and studio 54 was shut down. cocaine killed the club ind=
ustry</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; until house and techno music coupled with the sexual lia=
sons</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; depicted in the film 'basic instinct' brought it back in=
 the late </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; 80's and early 90's.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>5. bernardo bertolucci did the film 'the last emperor' about allegedly=
</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; the last chinese emperor. generally regarded as one of t=
he best</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; films ever made by an italian. it nominated for nine aca=
demy awards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; an oscar record at the time. as a result, many italian a=
merican</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; directors like martin scorsese and quentin tarantino mad=
e films</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on asian originals which finally got them oscar no=

here is an old post i made about oscars secrets revealed...

1. after my people crossed the land bridge to be eskimos over 4000
=A0 =A0 years ago, they migrated south to be native american indians, who
=A0 =A0 also started the poker games in saloons patterned after the old
=A0 =A0 ma-jong rooms of chinatown in san francisco, california 1800's.
=A0 =A0 my people built the chinese theatre in 1927 as a means to attract

=A0 =A0 more people to move out west purseing dreams of making it big
=A0 =A0 on the big screen. the theatre was patterned after the temple of th=
e=20
=A0 =A0 chinese emperor. i am related to one of the earliest chinese empero=
rs=20
=A0 =A0 when they were known as hwong dee, chosen messengers of God, a=20
=A0 =A0 direct descendent of shem, who was blessed by noah and traveled to=
=20
=A0 =A0 the mount of the east 5000 years ago to start the chinese royal lin=
e.
=A0=A0 chinese theatre started 4000 years ago to tell the stories of previo=
us
=A0 =A0 emperors.


2. the first show in the chinese theatre was 'king of kings' by cecil b. =
=A0
=A0 =A0 demille telling the story of jesus in jerusalem, who was callled=20
=A0 =A0 king of the jews. the root of david has to do with the blood line
=A0 =A0 of jesus that goes back to david, moses before he, jacob before
=A0 =A0 he, abraham before he, and shem way before he, son of noah.
=A0 =A0 my line started 33 generations before jesus. so yes, i would be=20
=A0 =A0 the missing 'king of kings' of the chinese theatre that was also
=A0 =A0 prophesized in revelation: of the seven churches which are in
=A0 =A0 asia, the most important is the 8th, the one that was, the one
=A0 =A0 that is, the one that goeth into perdition, not by choice but by
=A0 =A0 prophecy for final judgement. a king treated like a prisoner, but
=A0 =A0 how you treat this least of the kingdom of heaven, you shall be
=A0 =A0 treated. the least of the kingdom of heaven shall be greater than
=A0 =A0 john. and a little one shall lead them.


3. one of universal's earliest successful films was 'charlie chan'
=A0 =A0 based on a real honolulu chinese detective in the 1920's. it=A0
=A0 =A0 was later bought by the FOX franchise that also made successful
=A0 =A0 films with the very popular character. the asian detective was a
=A0 =A0 do gooder at a time when crime was prevalent after WWI due
=A0 =A0 to the great depression. in hollywood, stars were targeted by =A0=
=A0
=A0 =A0 dark tare criminals who robbed VIPs at gun point. the competition
=A0 =A0 amongst actresses grew fierce as well when black dalia, an ealy
=A0 =A0 black actress was killed by jealous white female actresses who
=A0 =A0 failed to get the part. so they grabbed her and threw her in front
=A0 =A0 of train track and she was sliced in half by the train. her death
=A0 =A0 was only surpassed by the death of george reeves, who played
=A0 =A0 superman at the time for most famous deaths of that era.


4. one of jack nicholson's earliest films was 'chinatown', where
=A0 =A0 he plays a detective investigating the aristocratic lives of the
=A0 =A0 rich in san francisco, california at the time. this was the film
=A0 =A0 that helped insire verhooven's infamous 'basic instinct' film
=A0 =A0 with michael douglas and sharon stone that catapulted both
=A0 =A0 their careers and resurrected the club industry that fell a bit
=A0 =A0 after the disco days of john travolta in saturday night live
=A0 =A0 when an older woman overdosed on an eightball of cocaine
=A0 =A0 and studio 54 was shut down. cocaine killed the club industry
=A0 =A0 until house and techno music coupled with the sexual liasons
=A0 =A0 depicted in the film 'basic instinct' brought it back in the late=
=20
=A0 =A0 80's and early 90's.


5. bernardo bertolucci did the film 'the last emperor' about allegedly
=A0 =A0 the last chinese emperor. generally regarded as one of the best
=A0 =A0 films ever made by an italian. it nominated for nine academy awards=
.
=A0 =A0 an oscar record at the time. as a result, many italian american
=A0 =A0 directors like martin scorsese and quentin tarantino made films
=A0 =A0 based on asian originals which finally got them oscar nominations
=A0 =A0 and wins.=20


6. not only is my line the true root of david line, i grew up in rootstown,
=A0 =A0 ohio. where i was known as a child prodigy designing hospitals in
=A0 =A0 lego in kindergarten, preaching at 6, visited by italian bishops fr=

=A0 =A0 =A0 to harras me and treat me like a kid so the dems can control
=A0 =A0 =A0 things in pathetic attempts to steal more US treasury funds.
=A0 =A0 =A0 my father is actually supposed to have been retired and moved
=A0 =A0 =A0 into fairwinds 6 years ago since he is a reagan era GOP, who
=A0 =A0 =A0 was caught pushing a pill that gave old people heart attacks
=A0 =A0 =A0 and almost killed me after getting tricked by nazi psychologist
=A0 =A0 =A0 mark geisbrecht to do so (he has a $5 million federal bounty
=A0 =A0 =A0 on his head now). dick cheney also got the same bad pill and

<DIV>here is an old post i made about oscars secrets revealed...<BR></DIV>
<DIV>1. after my people crossed the land bridge to be eskimos over 4000</DI=
V>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; years ago, they migrated south to be native american ind=
ians, who</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; also started the poker games in saloons patterned after =
the old</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; ma-jong rooms of chinatown in san francisco, california =
1800's.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; my people built the chinese theatre in 1927 as a means t=
o attract<BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; more people to move out west purseing dreams of making i=
t big</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; on the big screen. the theatre was patterned after the t=
emple of the </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; chinese emperor. i am related to one of the earliest chi=
nese emperors </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; when they were known as hwong dee, chosen messengers of =
God, a </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; direct descendent of shem, who was blessed by noah and t=
raveled to </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; the mount of the east 5000 years ago to start the chines=
e royal line.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp; chinese theatre started 4000 years ago to tell the storie=
s of previous</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; emperors.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>2. the first show in the chinese theatre was 'king of kings' by cecil =
b. &nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; demille telling the story of jesus in jerusalem, who was=
 callled </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; king of the jews. the root of david has to do with the b=
lood line</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; of jesus that goes back to david, moses before he, jacob=
 before</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; he, abraham before he, and shem way before he, son of no=
ah.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; my line started 33 generations before jesus. so yes, i w=
ould be </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; the missing 'king of kings' of the chinese theatre that =
was also</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; prophesized in revelation: of the seven churches which a=
re in</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; asia, the most important is the 8th, the one that was, t=
he one</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; that is, the one that goeth into perdition, not by choic=
e but by</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; prophecy for final judgement. a king treated like a pris=
oner, but</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; how you treat this least of the kingdom of heaven, you s=
hall be</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; treated. the least of the kingdom of heaven shall be gre=
ater than</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; john. and a little one shall lead them.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>3. one of universal's earliest successful films was 'charlie chan'</DI=
V>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on a real honolulu chinese detective in the 1920's=
. it&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; was later bought by the FOX franchise that also made suc=
cessful</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; films with the very popular character. the asian detecti=
ve was a</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; do gooder at a time when crime was prevalent after WWI d=
ue</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; to the great depression. in hollywood, stars were target=
ed by &nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; dark tare criminals who robbed VIPs at gun point. the co=
mpetition</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; amongst actresses grew fierce as well when black dalia, =
an ealy</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; black actress was killed by jealous white female actress=
es who</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; failed to get the part. so they grabbed her and threw he=
r in front</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; of train track and she was sliced in half by the train. =
her death</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; was only surpassed by the death of george reeves, who pl=
ayed</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; superman at the time for most famous deaths of that era.=
</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>4. one of jack nicholson's earliest films was 'chinatown', where</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; he plays a detective investigating the aristocratic live=
s of the</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; rich in san francisco, california at the time. this was =
the film</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; that helped insire verhooven's infamous 'basic instinct'=
 film</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; with michael douglas and sharon stone that catapulted bo=
th</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; their careers and resurrected the club industry that fel=
l a bit</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; after the disco days of john travolta in saturday night =
live</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; when an older woman overdosed on an eightball of cocaine=
</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; and studio 54 was shut down. cocaine killed the club ind=
ustry</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; until house and techno music coupled with the sexual lia=
sons</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; depicted in the film 'basic instinct' brought it back in=
 the late </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; 80's and early 90's.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>5. bernardo bertolucci did the film 'the last emperor' about allegedly=
</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; the last chinese emperor. generally regarded as one of t=
he best</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; films ever made by an italian. it nominated for nine aca=
demy awards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; an oscar record at the time. as a result, many italian a=
merican</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; directors like martin scorsese and quentin tarantino mad=
e films</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on asian originals which finally got them oscar no=

<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; and wins. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;himself as soon as he stepped into the offi=

<DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 million people on inauguration day. that =

<div>here is an old post i made about oscars secrets revealed...<br></div>
<div>1. after my people crossed the land bridge to be eskimos over 4000</div=
>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; years ago, they migrated south to be native american indi=
ans, who</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; also started the poker games in saloons patterned after t=
he old</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ma-jong rooms of chinatown in san francisco, california 1=
800's.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; my people built the chinese theatre in 1927 as a means to=
 attract<br></div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; more people to move out west purseing dreams of making it=
 big</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; on the big screen. the theatre was patterned after the te=
mple of the </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; chinese emperor. i am related to one of the earliest chin=
ese emperors </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; when they were known as hwong dee, chosen messengers of G=
od, a </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; direct descendent of shem, who was blessed by noah and tr=
aveled to </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the mount of the east 5000 years ago to start the chinese=
 royal line.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; chinese theatre started 4000 years ago to tell the stories=
 of previous</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; emperors.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>2. the first show in the chinese theatre was 'king of kings' by cecil b=
. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; demille telling the story of jesus in jerusalem, who was c=
allled </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; king of the jews. the root of david has to do with the bl=
ood line</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; of jesus that goes back to david, moses before he, jacob b=
efore</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; he, abraham before he, and shem way before he, son of noa=
h.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; my line started 33 generations before jesus. so yes, i wo=
uld be </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the missing 'king of kings' of the chinese theatre that w=
as also</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; prophesized in revelation: of the seven churches which ar=
e in</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; asia, the most important is the 8th, the one that was, th=
e one</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; that is, the one that goeth into perdition, not by choice=
 but by</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; prophecy for final judgement. a king treated like a priso=
ner, but</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; how you treat this least of the kingdom of heaven, you sh=
all be</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; treated. the least of the kingdom of heaven shall be grea=
ter than</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; john. and a little one shall lead them.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>3. one of universal's earliest successful films was 'charlie chan'</div=
>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on a real honolulu chinese detective in the 1920's.=
 it&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; was later bought by the FOX franchise that also made succ=
essful</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; films with the very popular character. the asian detectiv=
e was a</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; do gooder at a time when crime was prevalent after WWI du=
e</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; to the great depression. in hollywood, stars were targete=
d by &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; dark tare criminals who robbed VIPs at gun point. the com=
petition</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; amongst actresses grew fierce as well when black dalia, a=
n ealy</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; black actress was killed by jealous white female actresse=
s who</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; failed to get the part. so they grabbed her and threw her=
 in front</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; of train track and she was sliced in half by the train. h=
er death</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; was only surpassed by the death of george reeves, who pla=
yed</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; superman at the time for most famous deaths of that era.<=
/div>
<div><br></div>
<div>4. one of jack nicholson's earliest films was 'chinatown', where</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; he plays a detective investigating the aristocratic lives=
 of the</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; rich in san francisco, california at the time. this was t=
he film</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; that helped insire verhooven's infamous 'basic instinct' f=
ilm</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; with michael douglas and sharon stone that catapulted bot=
h</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; their careers and resurrected the club industry that fell=
 a bit</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; after the disco days of john travolta in saturday night l=
ive</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; when an older woman overdosed on an eightball of cocaine<=
/div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; and studio 54 was shut down. cocaine killed the club indu=
stry</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; until house and techno music coupled with the sexual lias=
ons</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; depicted in the film 'basic instinct' brought it back in t=
he late </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 80's and early 90's.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>5. bernardo bertolucci did the film 'the last emperor' about allegedly<=
/div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the last chinese emperor. generally regarded as one of th=
e best</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; films ever made by an italian. it nominated for nine acad=
emy awards.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; an oscar record at the time. as a result, many italian am=
erican</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; directors like martin scorsese and quentin tarantino made=
 films</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on asian originals which finally got them oscar nom=
inations</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; and wins. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;UN building in haiti was blown up killing 50=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;50 tribes. hope for haiti was done by celebr=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it was taken by obama &amp; his people who t=
ook the money to pretend</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to be doctors that hacked up 200,000 people i=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for the machete gangs that claimed to be sur=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;up 200,000 people in haiti. this was the rea=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;kidnapped a bitish couple and a US ship capt=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;love fest vegas and obama's dark tare showed=
 up, called women</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ho's to rob them at gun point. after raping s=
ome of them, they</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;were found dead with bullet holes in the des=
ert. apparently</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;obama's people did it as revenge for the mon=
te carlo fire attack</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;targeting obama's lobbyists who had cheated o=
n their wives with</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;call girls in the penthouse at the monte car=
lo. that and the fact</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that obama's early released black criminals s=
hot tupac, shot three</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;people after all-stars, shot 5 people at new=
 york new york hotel &amp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;casino, 2 people at caesars palace, shot up t=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;jumped &amp; mugged some people outside of t=
he MGM, shot so</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;many street women, killed so many celebritie=
s with bad pills,</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and the niger underwear bomber that tried to=
 kill eminem when</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;he was booked in vegas is exactly why obama w=
as warned to stay </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out of vegas recently because there were plo=
ts to kill him due to</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;his people causing vegas so many problems. &=
nbsp;i was the one who</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;started obama's secret service with the US a=
rmy after he inserted &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a prayer in a hole in a wall asking God to p=
rotect his family. but</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;after obama sent the white parts of his US a=
rmy secret service to</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;be blown up so his ealy released black crimi=
nals that burned</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;california for 6 yrs in a row could ID theft=
 attacked soldiers for</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;disability checks sent to germany to import m=
ore pills &amp; guns</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;increasing armed robbery and attacks on stre=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;resulting in so many celebrity deaths recent=
ly, a large part of&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;obama's former secret service defected and j=
oined me on west</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;coast homeland security. they were used for w=
inter olympics</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;security in vancouver (which was used to com=
fort 185 nations and</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;50 tribes that wanted to kill obama since hi=
s people killed 5000</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;people in that UN building in haiti of 185 n=
ations and 50 tribes</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and hacked up 200,000 haitians pretending to=
 be doctors when</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they were former machete gangs from africa w=
here obama really</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;was born. not hawaii. he actually used his s=
ister's certificate of&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;live birth from hawaii and laset digitized h=
is personal information </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on there to pretend he was born in hawaii to=
 play president on TV.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i was the one that warned him that he took a=
n oath to execute</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;himself as soon as he stepped into the offic=
e of president before</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 million people on inauguration day. that i=
s why he ended up</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;taking the fraternal order of police to prot=
ect and serve american</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;citizens in the map room later. ironically, 2=
 million people ended</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;up protesting against his corrupt and overly=
 expensive obamacare</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;plans after it killed so many celebrities al=
ready. 1 million people</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;protested against him in california when he c=
ame to SF and stole</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;love fest SF funds. as a result i had to boo=
k tila tequila for exotic</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;erotic ball on her b-day to appease some rea=
lly pissed off northern</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;californians that wanted to kill obama. that=
 coupled with the fact</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that obama's early released black criminals burned=
 california for</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 yrs in a row was the reason why part of obama's d=
efected secret</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; service joined me here on west coast homeland secu=
rity, assisted</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with security for winter olympics and the oscars a=
nd secretly kept</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the black cards they had but changed the name to b=
arack hussein</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; obama so that their bills would have to be covered=
 by obama. the</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; least obama can do since he sent part of his secre=
t service to be</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blown up in iraq and chaged the $20M house he got i=
n martha's</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vineyards to his secret service after they lost to=
 him playing basketball</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; behind the white house. alot of the extra expenses=
 were covered</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with said black cards and yes, the bills will be g=
oing to barack</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hussein obama. many of the families of the victims=
 of 9/11,</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 yrs of cali wildfires, those who lost loved ones=
 in wars or fires,</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and those who lost loved ones due to obama's early=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; black criminals killing parts of their families li=
ke jennifer hudson</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may also use black cards in barack hussein obama's=

I'm not sure what is the best part of that ridiculous email, but I'm leaning=
 towards:

"in 5th grade. was scouted for US DOD / NORAD after getting the highest scor=

In fact, I might just have to post that whole thing online somewhere so the s=

<div>here is an old post i made about oscars secrets revealed...<br></div>
<div>1. after my people crossed the land bridge to be eskimos over 4000</div=
>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; years ago, they migrated south to be native american indi=
ans, who</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; also started the poker games in saloons patterned after t=
he old</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ma-jong rooms of chinatown in san francisco, california 1=
800's.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; my people built the chinese theatre in 1927 as a means to=
 attract<br></div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; more people to move out west purseing dreams of making it=
 big</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; on the big screen. the theatre was patterned after the te=
mple of the </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; chinese emperor. i am related to one of the earliest chin=
ese emperors </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; when they were known as hwong dee, chosen messengers of G=
od, a </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; direct descendent of shem, who was blessed by noah and tr=
aveled to </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the mount of the east 5000 years ago to start the chinese=
 royal line.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; chinese theatre started 4000 years ago to tell the stories=
 of previous</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; emperors.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>2. the first show in the chinese theatre was 'king of kings' by cecil b=
. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; demille telling the story of jesus in jerusalem, who was c=
allled </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; king of the jews. the root of david has to do with the bl=
ood line</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; of jesus that goes back to david, moses before he, jacob b=
efore</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; he, abraham before he, and shem way before he, son of noa=
h.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; my line started 33 generations before jesus. so yes, i wo=
uld be </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the missing 'king of kings' of the chinese theatre that w=
as also</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; prophesized in revelation: of the seven churches which ar=
e in</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; asia, the most important is the 8th, the one that was, th=
e one</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; that is, the one that goeth into perdition, not by choice=
 but by</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; prophecy for final judgement. a king treated like a priso=
ner, but</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; how you treat this least of the kingdom of heaven, you sh=
all be</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; treated. the least of the kingdom of heaven shall be grea=
ter than</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; john. and a little one shall lead them.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>3. one of universal's earliest successful films was 'charlie chan'</div=
>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on a real honolulu chinese detective in the 1920's.=
 it&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; was later bought by the FOX franchise that also made succ=
essful</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; films with the very popular character. the asian detectiv=
e was a</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; do gooder at a time when crime was prevalent after WWI du=
e</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; to the great depression. in hollywood, stars were targete=
d by &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; dark tare criminals who robbed VIPs at gun point. the com=
petition</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; amongst actresses grew fierce as well when black dalia, a=
n ealy</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; black actress was killed by jealous white female actresse=
s who</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; failed to get the part. so they grabbed her and threw her=
 in front</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; of train track and she was sliced in half by the train. h=
er death</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; was only surpassed by the death of george reeves, who pla=
yed</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; superman at the time for most famous deaths of that era.<=
/div>
<div><br></div>
<div>4. one of jack nicholson's earliest films was 'chinatown', where</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; he plays a detective investigating the aristocratic lives=
 of the</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; rich in san francisco, california at the time. this was t=
he film</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; that helped insire verhooven's infamous 'basic instinct' f=
ilm</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; with michael douglas and sharon stone that catapulted bot=
h</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; their careers and resurrected the club industry that fell=
 a bit</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; after the disco days of john travolta in saturday night l=
ive</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; when an older woman overdosed on an eightball of cocaine<=
/div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; and studio 54 was shut down. cocaine killed the club indu=
stry</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; until house and techno music coupled with the sexual lias=
ons</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; depicted in the film 'basic instinct' brought it back in t=
he late </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 80's and early 90's.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>5. bernardo bertolucci did the film 'the last emperor' about allegedly<=
/div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the last chinese emperor. generally regarded as one of th=
e best</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; films ever made by an italian. it nominated for nine acad=
emy awards.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; an oscar record at the time. as a result, many italian am=
erican</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; directors like martin scorsese and quentin tarantino made=
 films</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on asian originals which finally got them oscar nom=
inations</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; and wins. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;were found dead with bullet holes in the des=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;obama's people did it as revenge for the mon=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;call girls in the penthouse at the monte car=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that obama's early released black criminals s=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and the niger underwear bomber that tried to=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;he was booked in vegas is exactly why obama w=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out of vegas recently because there were plo=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;his people causing vegas so many problems. &=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;obama's former secret service defected and j=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;coast homeland security. they were used for w=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;security in vancouver (which was used to com=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;people in that UN building in haiti of 185 n=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and hacked up 200,000 haitians pretending to=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they were former machete gangs from africa w=
here obama really</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;was born. not hawaii. he actually used his s=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;live birth from hawaii and laset digitized h=
is personal information </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on there to pretend he was born in hawaii to=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i was the one that warned him that he took a=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;himself as soon as he stepped into the offic=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 million people on inauguration day. that i=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;taking the fraternal order of police to prot=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;citizens in the map room later. ironically, 2=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;protested against him in california when he c=

 coupled with the fact</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that obama's early released black criminals burned=
 california for</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 yrs in a row was the reason why part of obama's d=

    also started the poker games in saloons patterned after the old
    ma-jong rooms of chinatown in san francisco, california 1800's.
    my people built the chinese theatre in 1927 as a means to attract

    more people to move out west purseing dreams of making it big

    the mount of the east 5000 years ago to start the chinese royal line.
   chinese theatre started 4000 years ago to tell the stories of previous
    emperors.

=20
    demille telling the story of jesus in jerusalem, who was callled=20
    king of the jews. the root of david has to do with the blood line

    my line started 33 generations before jesus. so yes, i would be=20

    that is, the one that goeth into perdition, not by choice but by
    prophecy for final judgement. a king treated like a prisoner, but
    how you treat this least of the kingdom of heaven, you shall be
    treated. the least of the kingdom of heaven shall be greater than
    john. and a little one shall lead them.


3. one of universal's earliest successful films was 'charlie chan'
    based on a real honolulu chinese detective in the 1920's. it=20
    was later bought by the FOX franchise that also made successful
    films with the very popular character. the asian detective was a
    do gooder at a time when crime was prevalent after WWI due
    to the great depression. in hollywood, stars were targeted by  =20
    dark tare criminals who robbed VIPs at gun point. the competition
    amongst actresses grew fierce as well when black dalia, an ealy
    black actress was killed by jealous white female actresses who
    failed to get the part. so they grabbed her and threw her in front
    of train track and she was sliced in half by the train. her death
    was only surpassed by the death of george reeves, who played
    superman at the time for most famous deaths of that era.


4. one of jack nicholson's earliest films was 'chinatown', where
    he plays a detective investigating the aristocratic lives of the
    rich in san francisco, california at the time. this was the film
    that helped insire verhooven's infamous 'basic instinct' film
    with michael douglas and sharon stone that catapulted both
    their careers and resurrected the club industry that fell a bit
    after the disco days of john travolta in saturday night live
    when an older woman overdosed on an eightball of cocaine
    and studio 54 was shut down. cocaine killed the club industry
    until house and techno music coupled with the sexual liasons
    depicted in the film 'basic instinct' brought it back in the late=20
    80's and early 90's.


5. bernardo bertolucci did the film 'the last emperor' about allegedly
    the last chinese emperor. generally regarded as one of the best
    films ever made by an italian. it nominated for nine academy awards.
    an oscar record at the time. as a result, many italian american
    directors like martin scorsese and quentin tarantino made films
    based on asian originals which finally got them oscar nominations
    and wins.=20

    young preaching asian boy and holy miracles occuring around me.
    that was when i was put through first communion and got my first

      are taken from the chinese theatre where oscars started and are
      put back in the chinese theatre for storage until the next oscars.
      both the gold medals and the oscars were slightly larger this
      year thanks to my ok'ing $400/oz gold sale out of the US treasury

      owner of the US treasury with the $1.4 trillion i made the US

      ohio march 20, 1970. home of the debartolos who own the SF
      49ers, the pittsburgh penguins, and malls all over america, thus
      my fashion hook ups. obama only pretended to be US president
      on TV to embezzle funds out of the US treasury wasting most=20
      of it on unnecessary DNC pork barreling such as $20M for ham

      that ship. many of the cruise ships registered to the UK were
      gifted to me since i made the UK $100 billion at WTO '05
       in China and the UK owes me 10% back or $10 billion. but
       instead i got the UK regstered cruise ships. i got one mercedes
       from germany since i helped start love parade belin and SF,=20

      for yet. thus the mercedes with my name on the back of it.
      which my mom stole claiming she is now shiang tsang when
      she used to be miranda tsang. my sneaky parents also sold my
      house in vegas from under my feet. they are paid off by dems
      to harras me and treat me like a kid so the dems can control
      things in pathetic attempts to steal more US treasury funds.
      my father is actually supposed to have been retired and moved
      into fairwinds 6 years ago since he is a reagan era GOP, who
      was caught pushing a pill that gave old people heart attacks
      and almost killed me after getting tricked by nazi psychologist
      mark geisbrecht to do so (he has a $5 million federal bounty
      on his head now). dick cheney also got the same bad pill and
      also suffered the same problems i did. he shot the sneaky
      lawyer who gave him the bad pill in the ass and bush launched
      the walter reed investigation that cracked down on corrupt=20
      health care that discovered that obama's early released black
      criminals claimed to be orderlies to get pills from DNC lawyers
      pretending to be doctors who misdiagnosed seniors to charge

      obama's dark tares who sold them to college kids and some
      VIPs resulting is so many celebrity deaths recently.=20


10.  the film that ended up winning the oscar for best film was 'the hurt
       locker' a film directed by james cameron's ex-wife about a bomb
       disposal unit in iraq. it was made, nominated, and picked to win
       to appease over 5000 US troops that died in afghanistan and iraq
       and over 30,000 injured mostly due to IEDs that turned out to be
       old german WWII bombs shells converted to IEDs after being bought
       off the international black market by al quida african immigrant=20
       terrorists aka obama's people from africa. they were made just
       like the car bombs the black panthers used in the 60s and 70s.
       obama used black panthers to threaten people to vote for him
       at the voting booths of they would burn more neighborhoods.
       he also used ACORN kids to ID theft football player names to=20
       stuff the ballot box and moved elections early so our troops=20
       couldn't vote to cheat his way into the white house. obama
       can not legally be the US president since he was not born in
       america. he was born in kenya, africa where our US embassy
       was blown up in 1993 killing 200 people making him by definition
       al quida. 5000 people were just killed in the same way when the
       UN building in haiti was blown up killing 5000 of 185 nations and
       50 tribes. hope for haiti was done by celebrities to raise funds, bu=
t
       it was taken by obama & his people who took the money to pretend
       to be doctors that hacked up 200,000 people in haiti. recently,
       has asked $950 billion for his corrupt obamacare plan that has
       killed too many celebrities already adding on another $10 billion
       for the machete gangs that claimed to be surgeons and hacked
       up 200,000 people in haiti. this was the real reason why i had
       to delay the charlie's angels VIP cruises since somali pirates had
       kidnapped a bitish couple and a US ship captain in an attempt
       to ID theft them to get on board the cruises i had promoted for
       to rob VIPs at gun point, which they did when i promoted for
       love fest vegas and obama's dark tare showed up, called women
       ho's to rob them at gun point. after raping some of them, they
       were found dead with bullet holes in the desert. apparently
       obama's people did it as revenge for the monte carlo fire attack
       targeting obama's lobbyists who had cheated on their wives with
       call girls in the penthouse at the monte carlo. that and the fact
       that obama's early released black criminals shot tupac, shot three
       people after all-stars, shot 5 people at new york new york hotel &
       casino, 2 people at caesars palace, shot up the gold nugget,=20
       jumped & mugged some people outside of the MGM, shot so
       many street women, killed so many celebrities with bad pills,
       and the niger underwear bomber that tried to kill eminem when
       he was booked in vegas is exactly why obama was warned to stay=20
       out of vegas recently because there were plots to kill him due to
       his people causing vegas so many problems.  i was the one who
       started obama's secret service with the US army after he inserted  =
=20
       a prayer in a hole in a wall asking God to protect his family. but
       after obama sent the white parts of his US army secret service to
       be blown up so his ealy released black criminals that burned
       california for 6 yrs in a row could ID theft attacked soldiers for
       disability checks sent to germany to import more pills & guns
       increasing armed robbery and attacks on street women and VIPs
       resulting in so many celebrity deaths recently, a large part of=20
       obama's former secret service defected and joined me on west
       coast homeland security. they were used for winter olympics
       security in vancouver (which was used to comfort 185 nations and
       50 tribes that wanted to kill obama since his people killed 5000
       people in that UN building in haiti of 185 nations and 50 tribes
       and hacked up 200,000 haitians pretending to be doctors when
       they were former machete gangs from africa where obama really
       was born. not hawaii. he actually used his sister's certificate of=
=20
       live birth from hawaii and laset digitized his personal information=
=20
       on there to pretend he was born in hawaii to play president on TV.
       i was the one that warned him that he took an oath to execute
       himself as soon as he stepped into the office of president before
       2 million people on inauguration day. that is why he ended up
       taking the fraternal order of police to protect and serve american
       citizens in the map room later. ironically, 2 million people ended
       up protesting against his corrupt and overly expensive obamacare
       plans after it killed so many celebrities already. 1 million people
       protested against him in california when he came to SF and stole
       love fest SF funds. as a result i had to book tila tequila for exoti=
c
       erotic ball on her b-day to appease some really pissed off northern
       californians that wanted to kill obama. that coupled with the fact
      that obama's early released black criminals burned california for
      6 yrs in a row was the reason why part of obama's defected secret
      service joined me here on west coast homeland security, assisted
      with security for winter olympics and the oscars and secretly kept
      the black cards they had but changed the name to barack hussein
      obama so that their bills would have to be covered by obama. the
      least obama can do since he sent part of his secret service to be
      blown up in iraq and chaged the $20M house he got in martha's
      vineyards to his secret service after they lost to him playing basket=
ball
      behind the white house. alot of the extra expenses were covered
      with said black cards and yes, the bills will be going to barack
      hussein obama. many of the families of the victims of 9/11,
      6 yrs of cali wildfires, those who lost loved ones in wars or fires,
      and those who lost loved ones due to obama's early released
      black criminals killing parts of their families like jennifer hudson
      may also use black cards in barack hussein obama's name since
      obama owes them so much for loved ones killed by his early
      release program of black criminals.

o attract<br>
</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; more people to move out west purseing dreams of making i=
t big</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; on the big screen. the theatre was patterned after the t=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; chinese emperor. i am related to one of the earliest chi=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; when they were known as hwong dee, chosen messengers of =

s of previous</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; emperors.</div>


<div><br>
</div>


<div>2. the first show in the chinese theatre was 'king of kings' by cecil =
b. &nbsp;</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; demille telling the story of jesus in jerusalem, who was=
 callled </div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; king of the jews. the root of david has to do with the b=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and the niger underwear bomber that tried t=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;his people causing vegas so many problems. =

army after he inserted &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a prayer in a hole in a wall asking God to =

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;after obama sent the white parts of his US =

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they were former machete gangs from africa =
where obama really</div>

his personal information </div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on there to pretend he was born in hawaii t=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i was the one that warned him that he took =
an oath to execute</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;himself as soon as he stepped into the offi=
ce of president before</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 million people on inauguration day. that =

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that obama's early released black criminals burne=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with security for winter olympics and the oscars =
and secretly kept</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the black cards they had but changed the name to =
barack hussein</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; obama so that their bills would have to be covere=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vineyards to his secret service after they lost t=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; behind the white house. alot of the extra expense=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with said black cards and yes, the bills will be =
going to barack</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hussein obama. many of the families of the victim=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 yrs of cali wildfires, those who lost loved one=

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; black criminals killing parts of their families l=
ike jennifer hudson</div>


<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may also use black cards in barack hussein obama'=

if FA7 goes off, i think the name should be changed to LOVE AFFAIR since
FAMILY AFFAIR is long over with. plus it'll combine the vibe of LOVE PARADE
that i helped start on the west coast in SF with LOVE FEST now known as LOV=
E
EVOLUTION (changed to avoid copyright infringements with LOVE PARADE in
germany and LOVE FEST in LA and hawaii).
=A0
unfortunatley, on this list, with the way things are going with iamretarded=
two,
=A0it may soon become COOK THE LOVE AFFAIR!

regardless, i hope everyone has a happy holiday despite the haters!

he wanted to do him up the butt for screwing china out of so much money and
still not paying it back yet.

the anniversary for the UN. as a result, like FAMILY AFFAIR in ohio, i was =

I've heard there are good happy hour events in SF. =A0They go from 6-10. =
=A0I went to a great happy hour event on a Thursday night when I was in Sea=

I haven't heard about anything like that around here, but I would go if the=

* there may well exist these types of events, but they would be likely lost=
 in the aforementioned Facebook noise.

I hear the raves here are different in many ways from the last I attended (=

I've heard there are good happy hour events in SF. =A0They go from 6-10. =
=A0I went to a great happy hour event on a Thursday night when I was in Sea=
ttle earlier this year.


I haven't heard about anything like that around here, but I would go if the=
re were! =A0I've thought of arranging one myself...to fill the void. =A0


* there may well exist these types of events, but they would be likely lost=
 in the aforementioned Facebook noise.

I hear the raves here are different in many ways from the last I attended (=

nights, raves, general parties.

I've heard there are good happy hour events in SF. =A0They go from 6-10. =
=A0I went to a great happy hour event on a Thursday night when I was in Sea=
ttle earlier this year.


I haven't heard about anything like that around here, but I would go if the=
re were! =A0I've thought of arranging one myself...to fill the void. =A0


* there may well exist these types of events, but they would be likely lost=
 in the aforementioned Facebook noise.

I landed in the Burningman end of the scene, which was great until 2009ish.=

Glad to hear about anything else going on, rave or otherwise; I just want t=

I really enjoy the vibe of "Electrocrunk", a monthly here in Pittsburgh eve=

oir/pittsburgh track authority/Humanaut throw good events.

I hear the raves here are different in many ways from the last I attended (=
2004?)- just different demographic and different interaction.

I'd love to hear good suggestions or comments on pb-cle area events - club =
nights, raves, general parties.
