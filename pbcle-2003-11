Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} Helloween review

Well to summarize this one up...


Got at venue around 11:30 or so, and after we got organized and went in, we
got to first stage, which was a barn area with 2 Technobeams or some
scanners, and some decent EV sound. Walked in to Supar Mario (with no Luigi)
doing a live PA of tech housey stuff ( <<kewl costume (Joke of the night
that we didn?t get his real name but referred to him as Mario)) . After a
Jay (Alaska) came on, people were coming out of the woodwork in the room, it
got crazy. 

After a bit of funny bidnass  (and Jays ass (more inside jokes)), we moved
to mainstage. Again, good lighting out from Vast and pretty bangin sound.
Came into Adam Jay doing a dj set. Stuck around but we were out and around
from then on. At other barn tent, React  (Randy) blew the fuckin roof off
that place with some great techno. Yes trout, more of that is LONG OVERDUE
around here (Can't wait for ThIRD EYE!!!!). Anyways after his set and some
kewl pics with Soniq Stlez and our floppity fishy friend (wait am I bringing
up another inside joke?), we advanced back to main tent. Good dnb from here
on with Casper and Snuggles, untill Emiit and Bad Leuitant (?)/ Voight
Kampff came on. Which then took them a bit to set up, and they put on a
great show but were having some sound difficulites half way through their
set. Still great to see them. Mc Ronin was aight, but the 4 emcees on at
once trying to beatbox to kill dead air (while VK set up) was worse than
listening to Soniq putting a mic to his bum and firing "beans" out all night
(yah this ones way over you with its insidedeness :-p ). Then the 2 djs from
NY, advertised as Acid House and Acid Trance....sketchy. Trout knows what I
thought of it. It was DEFFINATELY not what they said they were, but more
like hard house to choco chip and macadania cookie cutter trance. Brilliant
skills too. :-p 

That?s that, everything fell apart from that point. We left at 6:50 or and
just got back to my house like at noon. Woosh what a fun drive.

Gnight. Gmorning. Gday. Whatever.

Alex

DROP ZONE 

@ Rhythm Room
on Thursday, November 6th


DJ ODI

(G Force / Digital Konfusion / Strategic Recordings / www.eroticbpm.com /
Well Known DJs)

New York City, NY

One of the most respected old school junglists this side of the Atlantic,
Odi has rocked dance floors everywhere he?s played. Ever since he got his
start at the famous New York City NASA parties in 1992 where he soon
became a resident, Odi eventually went on to spin nationally alongside
some of the biggest names in EDM, with AK1200, Rap, Aphrodite, Ritchie
Hawtin, and Frankie Bones to name only a few. Odi later became the first
jungle DJ to be accepted in the ZULU Nation. Also known for developing the
hip-step style, or what some call jump up, Odi has a list of productions
under his belt, including ?Defying the Tribes? and ?Anthem?. Not looking
to stop anywhere soon, Odi is the cofounder of G-Force, which consists,
among others, of Reid Speed. This will be a set not to miss, as Odi is
known not only for his disgustingly sick mixes and proper chune selection,
but also scratching methods that leave many awestruck.

Subject: {pb-cle} Mixer. Borrow? Rent?

Hey everybody.

I am having a birthday party for my little sister on Friday, November 14th.

We will be using a couple CD decks as well as turn tables.

My mixer is only two channels...

Would it be possible to borrow or rent a 4 channel mixer from a kind person 
for the evening of Friday, November 14th?

Please e-mail back to discuss further details.

Thanks in advance!


Frank went out to get beer.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} latest pix and shortie reviews

quickie reviews and pix:

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/helloween03
a potentially good party, we did hear some slamming sets earlier on, but 
the music kinda tapered off around 3am or so.  i think better lineups 
would have made it much better.  meaning don't put jungle on both stages 
at the same time, followed by housey stuff at the same time.  i was 
afraid of a field day repeat when it started raining after we got there. 
but it didn't rain hard or for very long.  little drizzle after.  
walking between stages was tricky at first till we figured where the 
muddy bits were.  jes was a drunken fool, couldn't keep her hands off 
alaskas ass.  alex was the zombie dj, killed by a nsync record to the 
chest.  course jes smashed the record right off and that was that for 
alex's costume.  ethan was a racoon burglar or something?  i was a 
goth.  um yeah, i didn't get a costume so i wore a sandman t-shirt.  
goth enough!  soniq got to sign lots of boobs, i probably should have 
stuck with him more and got in on that.  next time i guess.

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/kmfdm
it's kmfdm, what can i say.  missed the opening act.  bah.

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/input_weds2
lots of drunken fun.  dood on early had some dope oldskoolish acid type 
records.  alaska and jes lots of jungle goodness.

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/dieselboy
um.  hmm.  fuck salem cigarettes and the gestappo they had running 
around.  i managed to get about a dozen pix before being threated to be 
bounced out.  i fucking hate metropolis.  one week you can bring a 
camera, the next you can't.  one time its 18+, another its 21+.  the 
whole VIP, i'm special setup kinda bothers me.  i guess thats why i 
rarely ever go to metropolis.  i thought the new management was supposed 
to clean some of this up?  guess not.

the flyer said he was spinning 2-step, so i asked him the other 
day when i was talking to him if that was true. he hasnt played 2-
step in a good long while. but he said he would be playing broken 
beat and house, the reason being that the jungle he plays would be 
too similar to snuggles and whatever other cat was playing with 
them. but i guess in the end it wasnt that samey.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Helloween review

Yeah, I'd heard he was playing 2-step at first, so I was rather excited.
Then I found out this week he was playing jungle, along with the seven other
jungle acts, I was not pleased.

But I did want to see Punch, and I had committments to sign some titties, so
I said fuck it, I'll just get drunk and see what happens.

Signed Jes's titties...  she signed my ass...   that shit wash off you yet?

Night highlights:

 - floppy chick trying to make eye contact with me.
 - mass boob signings
 - T-Rexx dropping some suprise breaks on me
 - VK using Frogger during their set...  hahaha
 - sick amount of hot girls in leather

Night lowlights:

 - Having one of my Smirnoff Ice bottles knocked out of my hand.
 - jungle jungle jungle jungle jungle
 - Not feeling kandi enough to bring glowsticks, now thinking I might have
been able to actually SEE where I was going half the time

I don?t know, I was talking to Trout and asked if we were 2 of the only
peope on here that still went out? I think he should rename this list to the
ex-rave list. Sure theres not too much Cleve (FOR NOW), but theres always
stuff listed elsewhere on the ROM. Make a 2 hour drive for a party if you
still like the music?

Maybe we can do a Net Meet at some Detroit Party :-p

Party pooper hater,

alex

P.s. Long live the soundz of dj Punch and Skat!

We'll be moving (along with burningman.com, cloudfactory.org, hhdl.net,
and all our other cage-brethren) to a different colo in San Francisco
tonight from 8pm to 10pm, very roughly speaking. There will be no IP
address change to worry about, as this is just another (better-equipped)
facility from the same provider.  Sorry about the late notice.  I'll send
another notice when we're back up.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Helloween review

LOL!  Thats where I met some folks from this list!  At the DEMF!  Maybe we 
should start organizing one for next year?  LOL..Well, I would go out to see 
music too, 2 hours away or however.  I don't think I can do like a 6 hour 
drive or anything only if I could stay in the town for a while.  I rode with 
my friend lou to balitmore this past summer.  That was a 
loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong drive.  But fun.  or rather I 
couldn't remember cuz i slept the whole way there.

I think I don't go out, as in, go out of this horrible state, IE go out of 
kentucky, because I am getting old, and I am tired ALL the time.  I mean 
between 17 hours of class, studio art time, working part time, doing 
homework and other bs, when it comes time to throw down.  I can't even rave 
dance half the time.

It sucks because not even 3 years ago i would dance like the floor was on 
fire.
Stupid getting old and not having a car.  Actually its probably better that 
I don't have a car because I dont think human civilization could handle 
steve wiggins with car.

LOL..

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} John B.

My review;

The crowd:  much more into it than I expected...the
entire dance floor area (they cleared all the couches
out) was filled with folks who were obviously there to
see John B.  

Brent did a good job opening, even with a very
tongue-in-cheek version of 'hot in hurr' (not even
nelly's vocals...i really liked the stuff he built up
to John With.

John B:  I'd been warned before hand that he was a bit
of a cheeseball, so a lot of his stuff didn't suprise
me.  Lots of breakdowns, lots of synth lines that
hinted at electro and even trance at times,
interspersed with what to me was decent drum & bass
(I'm not a connesieur, so I caouldn't tell you what a
lot of it was).  I expected him to be a little lighter
than he was in the second half of his set...the tunes
got a tougher as the night went on, which i enjoyed. 
A few comments...smooth mixing, long floats, nothing
spectacular from a mixing standpoint.  Some tracks
seemed to drag out to the point where they became
monotonous, though.  I can't say as i enjoyed 'mickey'
or some of the other novelty tracks he dropped either.
 the first few were amusing, but after a while they
got kind of old.

All in all, it was a fun night.  The above bitches
about the music are relatively minor...t'was
definately worth the five bucks that i didn't have to
pay:P

One thing that really sucked, though, was the bloody
smoke machine they put in that blew smoke between the
bar and dance floor area...the thing made my fucking
eyes water every time they set it off.

That would be the TIGA remix.

Many of those were his own personal remixes.  I know he's got a mix of
Mickey coming out soon and some other 80's thing this week.



Oh... he has two remixes and tracks on the latest Oakenfold cd.... so that
explains the trance side of things.  The way I understand things he was
booked to play a lot of the 80's/Electro stuff because he doesn't get asked
to play that stuff very often and he likes to do it.

Considering he walks in wearing a Marty McFly t-shirt the 80's stuff is understandable.  lol. ; P  Every now and than I think a little bit of silliness is fun.
 
Personally, I enjoyed the evening...it was definitely infused with a lot of energy--and definitely he had his good blend of genres.  (very amusing to hear a nine inch nails mix btw) Though I will say I feel his set in cbus in July(?) I think was better....though that's no knock at all.  
 
Not the kind of night I'd have ever expected at good ol' loungey Merc.~~so that was a treat. 
 
That smoke machine really was the worst, I have got to agree!  And yes, Brent did great---reminded me I really need to make a point to catch a set from him more often.

its not a remix, but a remake. and suprisingly, i actually like 
it. not as good as the original, but still a fun track. i think 
the fun video might be part of the reason i like it.

Yes, I meant the Tiga remake, SORRRYYYYYY.

I had it when it came through on k7 before it got mass remixed and produced.
I love it and think it is quite campy even though I didn't really play it
out... much better than the original and great for getting looks from
people.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} John B.

The show was overall excellent.  Brent's selections were great and John B really laid it down when it came to playing original material.  I was surprised how far he'd taken the whole d&b/electro genre.  The two genres compliment each other pretty well.  

He has his own label dedicated to that kind of material and only one release has come out of it so far.  He's probably got enough tracks of his own to keep that label going on for a while tho. 

The crowd was definitely a drum and bass crowd (which is a good thing) Lots of energy going around and John B was definitely curtailing the set to it.  He did play a lot of tracks that were pretty hard, but I think he did a pretty good job of switching up the pace...people who weren't used to d&b may not have liked it as much tho.

The NIN remix that he played really got the crowd going.  I wonder if he consciously knew that Trent Resnor is from Cleveland.  Folks seemed to enjoy the Hey Micky remix as well.

The fog machine was definitely a pain in the rear.  That and John B had the sound cranked pretty high.  My hearing didn't come back till later the next day.  He even had one of the floor speakers turned around so he could use it as a monitor.  I wonder how much of his hearing he has left.  Certainly enough to keep putting out the phenominal tracks that he does.

i prefer the original. as much as most prog house shit sucks, that 
track has some of the best possible melodies in it. its too bad 
someone else in a different genre didnt come up with it first to 
make a better record out of it. but its up there with sandstorm 
and children as one of the best pop-trance melodies.

woohoo I finally got me a boompsie set, not sure if I'll pop it on cd

One side note about the John B show I found hysterical....a friend of mine had never seen John B before, and I just told him to look for the guy with the crazy hair.  Well...remember the mannequin on stage, the one that, uh...never moved.  Guess who he thought John B was.  LOLLLLLLLLLL.  : P
 
Sorry...couldn't resist...but hey, I'm not mentioning any names, it was just amusing, and still makes me smile.

Yes, I meant the Tiga remake, SORRRYYYYYY.

I had it when it came through on k7 before it got mass remixed and produced.
I love it and think it is quite campy even though I didn't really play it
out... much better than the original and great for getting looks from
people.

Yes The show Rawked
Alex wish you could have heard it
the fog def. was not kewl but it added to the lil halloween atmoshpere that 
was still left over from friday
very crowded which was very kewl !!!!
most all seemed to be enjoying the show
yes Brent rawked of course !!!
and the 80s was a great ending to the nite
especially those who are fans of the time (obviously)
as for N.I.N i believe they are actually one of his prefered bands
what I want to know is the track he played between ghostbusters and blue 
monday
any help would be appreciated
the final set actually inspired a new remix
which is some inspiration I've been lacking so that was really kew
I don't know if  2remixes and 2 trax is supposed to be 4 trax total or not
but i thought there were 4 mixes on the new oakenfold Cd
remixes or just new tracks
I'm not sure

Yes def couldn't miss the hair!!!
as for the mixing I would like to see someone do better on pair of cdj100s
they are not ment for a bunch of turntablism

I don't think anyone can say it wasn't worth the price of admission ;-)
great seeing all the kids out there
Calvin;Ben;Matt B.;Jes;Moose;Erik;Adam;
plus my very special company for the evening !
plus many more new/old etc...
Amy;kurt;Nikki;Jason
I actually had ppl comin up to me sayin "don't I know you?"
whooa
weird!?
I'm sure it wasn't what Mercury is used to but hey IT WORKED !!!
and well may I add

so here's a nickle

 This album is dedicated to all those that know Hardcore is the real Rave 
Music, and that it will continue to grow and prosper as long as technology 
thrives, and as long as mental, economical, social, and political 
innovation and progress occurs.  Without a doubt, there is still room for 
us to make a difference in the world through electronic music, and it will 
not happen with House, Trance or any other shameful musics that insult the 
intelligence of the average human being.

Rave on, you fuckers!!!
 Enjoy!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} THIS WEEK AT FUZE

well, it's not free music... the thing with wednesdays is... there are 3
legit nights that split up the crowd here in town (that i know of)... SPI
bar is 3 bucks to get in, with FREE beer from 10-11, and dollar drinks from
11-12... Electrasoul has bangin stuff on the southside with usually a pretty
solid lineup for $2 and half off martinis... and then Fuze is $2 with free
wings... i kinda prefer SPI or Electrasoul depending on who is playing just
because you can generally move around (SPI more than Zythos)... at the BBT,
i feel like if i put my arms out i could touch both walls... but i cant put
my arms out, cause my arms are kinda kept within 6" of my body in most areas
due to personal space limitations.  This week I'm sure that all three will
see a hit in attendance somewhat due to the Matrix being released... Which
by the way, celeste and I were gonna go see it at the IMAX where fleetwood
works... anyone else wanna go as a group?

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} John B.

The show was overall excellent.  Brent's selections were great and John
B really laid it down when it came to playing original material.  I was
surprised how far he'd taken the whole d&b/electro genre.  The two
genres compliment each other pretty well.  

He has his own label dedicated to that kind of material and only one
release has come out of it so far.  He's probably got enough tracks of
his own to keep that label going on for a while tho. 

The crowd was definitely a drum and bass crowd (which is a good thing)
Lots of energy going around and John B was definitely curtailing the set
to it.  He did play a lot of tracks that were pretty hard, but I think
he did a pretty good job of switching up the pace...people who weren't
used to d&b may not have liked it as much tho.

The NIN remix that he played really got the crowd going.  I wonder if he
consciously knew that Trent Resnor is from Cleveland when he played it.
Folks seemed to enjoy the Hey Micky remix as well.

The fog machine was definitely a pain in the rear.  That and John B had
the sound cranked pretty high.  My hearing didn't come back till later
the next day.  He even had one of the floor speakers turned around so he
could use it as a monitor.  I wonder how much of his hearing he has
left.  Certainly enough to keep putting out the phenominal tracks that
he does.

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP: Drop Zone with dj Odi tomorrow

Nice preview of the crazy bidness going down tomorow...Yes he will be on 3
dex!

DJ Odi     
With Jea Leigh, Majestic, and Drum Enforcement Agency. Thursday, November 6,
at the Rhythm Room.
BY MELODY CARABALLO

He's not bullet-ridden like 50 Cent, but premier NYC drum & bass DJ Odi did
get his musical start in lock-up: When he was nine, Odi's baby-sitter tossed
him in a room and left him to his own devices. He found a turntable -- and
his calling. By 18, he was cutting his teeth at the world-famous New York
City NASA parties. The Brooklyn boy soon produced tracks on Jungle Sky, the
first drum & bass label, and has been a longtime participant in New York's
renowned Koncrete Jungle nights.

As if that weren't enough, he's also credited with the advent of jump-up and
often compared to DJs Aphrodite and Soul Slinger. He is known for diverse
track selection, though, including jungle, house, breaks, and hip-hop in his
sets. This jungle kingpin flaunts crazy scratching skills and fierce
dubplates atop dense rhythms and hyper-syncopated beats. Equipment
permitting, he'll even rock it on three decks for the crowd.

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

DJ ODI

(G Force / Digital Konfusion / Strategic Recordings / www.eroticbpm.com  /
Well Known DJs)

New York City, NY

One of the most respected old school junglists this side of the Atlantic,
Odi has rocked dance floors everywhere he?s played. Ever since he got his
start at the famous New York City NASA parties in 1992 where he soon
became a resident, Odi eventually went on to spin nationally alongside
some of the biggest names in EDM, with AK1200, Rap, Aphrodite, Ritchie
Hawtin, and Frankie Bones to name only a few. Odi later became the first
jungle DJ to be accepted in the ZULU Nation. Also known for developing the
hip-step style, or what some call jump up, Odi has a list of productions
under his belt, including ?Defying the Tribes? and ?Anthem?. Not looking
to stop anywhere soon, Odi is the cofounder of G-Force, which consists,
among others, of Reid Speed. This will be a set not to miss, as Odi is
known not only for his disgustingly sick mixes and proper chune selection,
but also scratching methods that leave many awestruck.

Warm Art - Maetrik/Brian Aneurysm
Abbasso Underground Lounge
Nov. 8, 2003

Most people associate with Dallas the TV series with the famous J.R. and 
his gang, which was one of the first US soap operas to invade Europe in 
mid-eighties. But Dallas is also a hotbed of young techno producers, most 
notably Maetrik and Brian Aneurysm. Maetrik, who released the Connect EP 
(his debut 12" on Treibstoff) at the end of last year, has also released 
his music on various labels as Immigrant, Chalant, Iron Box and 
Intrinsic/UCMG. His music charms the listener with smooth, fresh sounds 
and "alive" effects, which give the music a breathing feeling. The tracks 
are on the edge of pop-driving music with a "Detroit feeling" and a safe 
"soul" taste, that keep them floating without leaving them undefined. 
Between hyperactive syntheziser sounds, sunrise topics and a touch of 
industrial techno, Maetrik shows his flexibility and delivers a sound that 
fits perfectly with todays demand for quality music.

Bernhard Pucher a.k.a. Brian Aneurysm is originally from Austria and now 
residing in Dallas, Texas. He discovered his interest in electronics back 
in 1996, spread his name as DJ and producer over the northern area of 
Texas and set up his his own label Iron Box Music in 2001. Bernhard has 
successfully synthesized a minimal aesthetic with an engaging sound that 
never sacrifices danceability to the minimal form.

Warm Art is proud to welcome both of these dynamic young producers to 
Cleveland for a taste of cutting edge sounds that haunt the grey area 
between techno and tech-house.

Sat Nov 15                  GLOBAL SPACE PROJECT                       DC??

Charles Feelgood
buzz dc/system recordings los angeles/ funky house, techno
Revered for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore / Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood (born Charles Fields) has 
earned a stellar reputation as a top-flight DJ in the international dance 
music community through his ingenious mixing skills and dynamic brand of 
funky disco house.
	
Scott Henry
buzz/fever, dc / ethereal techno w/ funky edge
By no means your average DJ, Scott Henry goes well beyond the time-honored 
tradition of rocking dancefloors. Granted, the man's long been an East 
Coast legend, having started the coast's most esteemed club nights-Fever 
in Baltimore and Buzz in Washington D.C, respectively, but Scott's role in 
American club culture outside of DJ'ing has now proven to be as important, 
if not more so, than his prowess behind the one and two's.
	
Anthony Paul - GSP Resident
Raven Productions, Progressive house / techno
	
Anthony Paul has made a name for himself in the EDM community with not 
just his skills behind the decks but with his uncanny energy and his love 
for the music. Hes gone from promoter to producer and has also helped 
push the music scene in Virginia. He is definetlya force to be reckoned 
with.
Ethernet - GSP Resident
Autodefrost / VA Techno, Live
	
DJ Ethernet has been playing all things techno for about 5 years in 
Virginia and its surrounding area with the collective Autodefrost. His 
furious mixing style of techno and on the fly remixing keeps the floor in 
constant motion.
	
Karri On - GSP Resident
Soulsations, vinyl house
	
Karri Ons style of swirling deep disco and jazz kept in time by chunky 
kicks, vocal edits and subbier than sub bass envelopes any room. She is 
one of those DJs that exude a particular style, 3 records into the set 
and you know she is on.
Antidote - GSP Resident
Progressive House and Techno
	
Progressing from trance to house to techno and back, Antidote doesnt seem 
to have a style, but plays what fits the mood. I dont mind playing hard 
or soft-house techno, what makes it all worthwhile is pumping the crowd, 
whatever Im spinning - Music is the cure for whatever it is that ails 
you.

FRIDAY NOVEMBER 21
CLEVELAND


.:Wish Nightclub is proud to present Dance Ritual featuring Little Louie
Vega:.

**

Little Louie Vega will be headlining on Friday November 21st at Wish's
"Reintroducing Wish Party".

Little Louie" Vega is the Miles Davis of dance music. Like the impossible
to categorize Davis, Vega is constantly reinventing himself and
revolutionizing music itself in the process. During his nearly two-decade
long career, Vega has crafted some of the most innovative singles in dance
music history ("The Nervous Track", "It's Alright", "I Feel It" and "You
Can Do It"), kick started genres like soulful house ("Beautiful People,"
"I Get Lifted"), and revitalized the careers of legends like Roy Ayers,
George Benson and Tito Puente.

Rob Black will be warming up the tables and dance floor as he is back to
his old legendary residency on Friday nights. Also, let's not forget about
Mike Metz in the Martini Bar spinning great soulful house lounge music.

We have just recently put in an Arabica coffee bar for that late night
pick me up...or that early on espresso martini!

Please come out to what should be an unbelievable night.

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE

Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each
other.  These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we
danced all night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower
ourselves as one tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the
power of these sites was released into our bodies, giving us strength and
connecting us to Gaia.  Then the religions of fear took hold. They
destroyed our sacred sites and our rituals, burning all who dared to
question. But the power could not be suppressed forever and the great
cycles of time have brought us full circle to this new moment and we
gather once again. The ancient memory has been reawakened, the all night
dance ritual has returned. We are once again experiencing the mystical
power of the Trance.

Your friends at Vacant Minds are pleased to announce
that on Saturday November 22nd, we present to you


THE REMOTE CONTROL TOUR


This will be a cd release party for
SUPERSTAR DJ KEOKI

Keoki will be making his return to Buffalo for this special event
ready to rock the decks with his flamboyant style and uncomparable 
technique. Its been over 3 years since the insane performance he gave us 
at Club E, and we think Buffalo is ready for another dose!

DJ Paul Edge

London, UK
Paul Edge aka Twister is an enigma.This dj/producer seems to epitomise the 
very essence of underground club culture. He has headlined around the 
world and has produced some of clublands finest dancefloor moments as 
Twister in te past 10 years. He consistently treads where other dj's fear 
to go, his techno electro fusion has made jaws drop from Buzz to Firestone 
to Twilo here in the states, and his residencies have made clubs 
legendary. He is standing firm currently in DJMixed.com/BPM's Top 100 and 
ready to show Buffalo what underground dance music is all about!


Xotec .. Buffalo/NY The godfather of Buffalo's underground dance scene. We 
all know him, and we all love him. No top 40, no bubblegum techno, just a 
turntable master doing what he does best, energizing the dancefloor and 
taking control of the vibe!

1st?---what  kind of(genre) records are you looking for?

both local stores stores will try to get you what ever they can
I've never ordered anything from the crayon
I've only heard good things
But I know for a fact  The whole Poo-Bahs crew has come through for me time 
and time again
If you know exactly what you want just ask
I promise they don't bite
...but the cat might !
Peace and happy hunting
...and don't forget about"digging"
that's half the fun !!
Reese

Subject: {pb-cle} Drop Zone !!-Thumpin !


3 events in 2 days
wedns nite-good music good ppl(all 6 of 'em)
Thurs nite- 1st stop: new club Karma-the old culture club-never been there
club looked good music was good but no1 was there
was a lil hard to find but nice dance floor !
2nd stop: back to the Rhythm Room
back--was there for the preliminary---was poppin then
but when I came back it was THUMPIN !!!
the place was very full and the crowd was growing rapidly
the clubbers didn't seem to want to come out this mid-week (recovering from 
hallowen ;-)
but the DnB heads were out and they were DANCING

ODI-played solidly and used evry piece of equipment he had available to him 
and
and of course  he kept the crowd hoppin !
But...
Jes TORE THE ROOF OFF THE PLACE !  (of course)
she had everybody up and movin !!!
twice as many ppl as  Mr. ODI
The downstairs was packed  and the BASS WAS THUMPIN
the lights were very nice except for the stobe and the cheezy avngr balls
there was pretty kewl laser but you couldn't see it cuz of the cheezy lites
even the MC wasn't that bad(sorry not an MC fan)---have respect for it just 
not hip to it
I will give him props for being his 2nd DnB show !

Always Kewl seeing all the familiar/friendly faces
The ControlThe Night crew; the Goahead crew(including Meaghan-nice surprise 
!)
The Troutster and his former roomy (another nice surprise)
got to meet Paul kewl kat---I'm sure he was like "who the H*** is this kid?"
hehhe
over all a GREAT time to be had by all

So I've been to 3 DnB events in just over a week
all completely dif venues & parties
but they all were very busy and very hoppin !
admittingly I AM not a DnB "head"
but the "DnB heads" seem to be the ones comin out

I'm waiting to see the attendences on NOv. 21st
I would love to be everywhere
but if the streets of Cleveland aren't throbbing from the feet of pounding 
dancers and thumpin kick drums
then a fear we might be lost !!

------------> NO WAY !
keep the Gruv alive

GoodMorning/GoodNight & GodSpeed(BT album)
hehe lil trance joke for Alex !
Great Party !

Reese

First off, Thank you Jason for having me out last night.  Much =
appreciated.

"andre 3000 - roses" to appease some of the outkast fans... i know it =
didn't sound all that superbly produced, but hell, i just started =
working on that remix on wednesday night at 11pm...=20

Lets hope that last year's event was no indication of how you people in
Buffalo party.

If I hadn't driven 3 hours to get there, only to have the price increased
at the door from that which was advertised, I would have left after 5
minutes.

ooh yea, buffalo is like pittsburgh subtracted from youngstown.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Drop Zone !!-Thumpin !

It was nice to see you too, along with Trout, Amanda, Matt B., Nox, etc. :)  I 
had a pretty decent time overall.  

I'm not a huge fan of DNB, but I dig it every once in a while.  I really don't 
like MCs, but Jea Leigh, Majestic and Odi all did very well.  Very impressed 
with Jes.  That was the first time I've heard her spin.  Keep up the good work, 
girl. :)

Got home around 3:45, went to bed, then woke back up at 7:15 to go to work this 
morning...thank goodness for desk jobs. Thank you Alex and Paul B. for the good 
time out. :)

Thank you to all you kats that came out and kept the vibe alive. We had several issues throughout, but all in all, everything fit together like a rubik's cube. Great to see all the familiar faces, Matt, Luke, Chris, Uzi, Ray, Trout and Co., etc. et all. Extra special thanks to Reese, Meghan, Ian and all the performers.
 
Will try and get a hold of Odi as he recorded if I'm not mistaken his and Jes's set both. Provided the sound koalatea is ok, Paul will post those up on our site. Also tons of pics from Ray and Trat. And some1 with a vid camera i need to get a hold of.
 
Next up... da 3rd Eye. Dun duh daaaaaaa!!! Clevo can't handle all that techno maddness!!
 
crazy fun,
alex

It was nice to see you too, along with Trout, Amanda, Matt B., Nox, etc. :) I 
had a pretty decent time overall. 

I'm not a huge fan of DNB, but I dig it every once in a while. I really don't 
like MCs, but Jea Leigh, Majestic and Odi all did very well. Very impressed 
with Jes. That was the first time I've heard her spin. Keep up the good work, 
girl. :)

Got home around 3:45, went to bed, then woke back up at 7:15 to go to work this 
morning...thank goodness for desk jobs. Thank you Alex and Paul B. for the good 
time out. :)

Not necessarily, Colin.

Let's not forget that prior to his "superstar dj" days, he was an A&R rep who brought Public Enemy
to the UK. Plus, he produced one of the better early 90's Manchester bands (happy mondays).

I tend to agree with Luke-Goa-Head....I think he fell off somewhere.

THOUGH...I heard someone playing a set of more soulful house downloaded from somewhere on the net,
and when I asked who it was, they said Oakenfold...so who knows? Perhaps he's just following
trends...but he's got some decent roots.

Yeah, but at the same time, he is just playing to the
market of people that are down for that kinda thing. 
I don't understand it, but I guess it works for some folks.

I'm not an Oakey hater. Just not into his gig at all.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootch!

Well, speaking out of experiences I've had with friends, he provides a convenient, easily accessible
entry point into the somewhat daunting and overwhelming arena of electronic dance music.

Whether we realize it or not since we're so used to it...the myriad genres, sub-genres and the
widespread semi-annonymity and "one guy performing under 14 different names" is a turnoff for many
people who would otherwise be down for the more obscure stuff.

Speaking personally, I turned someone on to Oakenfold back in 98, and she's progressed through the
trancier stuff down to being a big Naked Music/Mark Farina fan and is going even further in now with
more soulful techno and the newer broken beat stuff I keep preaching about.

Blah he's a good businessman and thats that. That fawker could care less for the EDM scene so long as its around for him to make some dough. Maybe it wasn't always so, but it has been at LEAST since the release of the Global underground series.

Good thing he's not making any money on "Oakenfold Sucks" clothing.

come on man, you should know that. oaky also lived in NYC and 
attended the paradise garage and lots of early hiphop shows. the 
guy's pedigree is pretty impressive, but the music he's into now 
sucks big time. i wonder how you get from such great backgrounds 
to such cash-in shite? what a ride it must be.

just a note based on something i actually witnessed.  when dude visited
pittsbrugh he ate $3 airport pizza for dinner and charged less than half of
what bad boy bill charged that year for djing, 25% of what derrick may
charged.  he didn't require a $100 hotel dinner with champagne like a techno
dj or three have.  i'm not quite sure where the statistics come from, but that
was my experience.  the media doesn't report the truth.  right now i'm reading
knowledge magazine's unbiased 4star rating of nicky blackmarket's new
trainwrecking 'mix' cd.  what a $hame.

derrick may actually invented something, unlike oaky who just 
witnessed some other people doing great things. bad boy bill also 
was a participant early on in house music where it began. that 
kind of experience costs $$$$. as interesting as it was producing 
the happy mondays, those guys wouldnt have existed without detroit 
and chicago.

I guess this only raises the bar for my performance @ Havana, since I'm trying to work an hour of

Thanks a LOT, Goose, ya big 'eff.

There is something to be said for those who can take
there talent and make millions on it.  You seem to
have this negative view of a man who has created
success for himself and those around him with his
abilities.  So he has not stuck with an underground
true techno style and he makes millions of dollars,
what is so wrong with that???  Have any of you who
take this negative view of him ever become board or
needed a change of pace???  For most of us, we set the
DnB, house, trance, breaks or our genre of choice down
and spin something else, for him, I am sure it is no
different, just on a more influencial level

i'm guessing the rates are far different than a friday or sat.
he was probably filling in dates between other gigs, thus the lower price.

Hey thanks guys!!

I had a really good time. Granted Odi and I had been
planning on kicking each others asses this night. We
had a drinking game going on and I pretty much layed
him out on everything. Fawkin ROCK. Not to mention Id
been drunk for 9 days straight. Im taking it easy
tonight.

Thanks Koala Tea for letting me come out to play, and
to everyone that came out to kick it. 

Im finally home, getting ready to rest up. Thanks
again everyone. It puts a smile on my face to see
everyone out there having a great time. =D

Then perhaps Oakenfold is getting paid for his art as a business man and a

He deserves the money he has made ...and his reputation... thats all there 
is to it.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Any time you set aside your genre of choice in order to have mass appeal and
make money from it, that's what I define as a sellout.

If you can push your personal genre of choice, and make a comfortable living
from it, I give you thumbs up.

`'Hummer 2. Included are her own Starbucks cup, credit card and country
`'club membership. Also available for this set are Shallow Ken and
Private
`'School Skipper. But you can't afford them anyway.
`'
`'Grafton Barbie:
`'This model comes dressed in her own Wrangler jeans two sizes too
small,
`'a NASCAR shirt and has a tattoo of a rose on her shoulder. She has big
`'hair, a six pack of Bud Light and a Hank Williams, Jr. CD set. She can
`'spit over 5 feet and can kick Mullet-haired Kenny doll's ass when
she's
`'drunk. Purchase her pickup truck separately and get its Confederate
flag
`'bumper stickers absolutely free. This model can also be applied to
`'Elyria, Brook Park, and Medina.
`'
`'Warehouse District Barbie:
`'This collagen injected, rhino plastic Barbie wears a leopard-print ski
`'outfit and drinks cosmopolitans while she entertains friends at the
`'club. Percocet prescription available.
`'
`'Coventry Barbie:
`'This doll is made of actual tofu, has long gray hair and archless
feet,
`'sandals with white socks, no makeup and a mutt. She prefers that you
`'call her " Willow."
`'
`'Parma Barbie:
`'This chain-smoking, brassy-haired Barbie has a pair of her own
`'high-heeled sandals with one broken heel from the time she chased her
`'beer-gutted boyfriend out of Club Dance. Her make-up is dark red lip
`'liner with your choice of lips covered in a sparkly pink or no fill-in
`'at all. Her ensemble includes low-rise acid-washed jeans with assorted
`'colored G-strings that stick out the back and a white see-through
`'halter-top. Accessories include: CD-player equipped with Bon Jovi and
a
`'rusty old Ford pick up.
`'
`'Brunswick County Barbie:
`'This Barbie is the same model of Barbie that was released in 1982. She
`'comes with shoulder pads, dark polyester skirt, white pantyhose,
`'sneakers, and a bad haircut.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootch!

Then I'll book him if I want him to pass out flyers or fix my budget.
However, that's prolly not in his contract, nor would I pay anywhere close
to what he's charging for either.

Anyone who charges $10k+ to play records and not even do a DMC skratch job
of it can lick balls. I don't care if they're bomb diggity ole skewl
producers. It's a shame and a slap in the face to the state this scene is in
now.

If theyre worried they'd get too many gigs, then they can either let
promoters bid up on them, or refuse gigs. No reason to expect some1 to MATCH
your personal high bid request of a said sum of money.

There are in fact going to be there.  Check the Club Laga website or
Ticketmaster.com.  Tickets are $27 plus a $6.85 per ticket inconvenience
charge.  Show starts at 11:30pm (and goes till?).  See ya there!

(Too mainstream to be on the ROM?)

Subject: {pb-cle} Sauce, Havana edition...post attempt #2

My first attempt to post this was cut short.  Kingston snuck up on me and
turned off my computer.  He's a cheeky monkey.
Anyway, as I was saying, I'm glad that I get to be the first one to post
about how great last night was.  I don't think I've danced or sweat that
much since Norm Talley was here.  Jwan got everyone all riled up, then Arnie
played perhaps the best set that he's ever played (sporting a Guns N Roses
shirt, no less).  Jim Selecta almost caused a riot by playing dancehall,
Bill Withers, Prince, and Stetsasonic, just to name a few.  People that
walked by the club stopped, did a double-take, and then tried to peer
through the fogged up windows to see what all the commotion was about.
Anyway, I needed that.  So thanks to everyone who was there.  I feel all
plurrious.
;-p

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootch!

Let me clarify what i meant.  We sometimes need a
challenge, something else, something different.  A
single style has never fit one person completely and
we all need to branch off.  For most Dj's, it is
spinning a different style; for producers often times,
it may be prodcing a band or a rapper.  We do not know
why Oakenfold does what he does, whether it is for the
money, the recognition, or the challenge to himself. 
The only person out there who can technicaly call
oakenfold a sell-out is himself.  You, and everyone
else out there, do not know why he does it.  Who are
we to call someone a sell-out with out knowledge of
understanding his actions first.  
All music is going to evolve.  In many people's
opinion, he is just way ahead of the game.  He,
instead of being a follower is trying to be an
innovator.  Maybe he just wants to try everything.

just for the record, selecta was kind enough to have jwan and arnie out to
play last night as they were scheduled to play at sauce, and we're 'in
transition'.  sauce is not moving to havana on fridays.  we're working on a
new permanent home - we'll get the info out as soon as everything is settled. 
in the meantime, ed will play with selecta at havana next friday.  we should
be up and running at the new location for the reggae bus crew and definitely
for bugz.

No, prolly not! We'll all be at Luke's Third Eye! I might stop bye Little
Louie Vega though. I talked to Odi and told him about that night with all 4
these parties, and he had nothing but good things to say about Louie, and
how he is probably one of the few people that he considers as

what has he done as a business man or promoter even? hoodwinked

id pay someone $10k+ if i had it to never scratch another record 
as long as i live. if anything has ruined the "scene" its 
concentration on technical skills over selection in deejaying. 
someone who brings experience and musical knowledge and varying 
selection and can murder crowds is worth so much more than someone 
who gets up there and wickky-wikky-wikkies all night.

this is a simple case of the market correcting any errors in 
itself. in reality, the big money deejays usually cost so much 
because they bring a ridiculous amount of people to the show at a 
high ticket price. if they didnt, they wouldnt get any gigs at all 
in the club market. the correction that occured actually involved 
the slightly less well known deejays who were charging crazy loot 
but not really deserving it, simply because of the bubble in the 
rave scene market. that bubble burst and now things seem to be 
mostly going either local/regional or superstar headliner with no 
inbetweens. i can remember way too many raves with headliners who 
were just jokers. now that doesnt happen anymore.

his roots: hiphop, garage, acid house

where he is now: crap drug music

he sold out his roots. thats what selling out is. i know it, 
everyone else knows it. the only people who dont know it are the 
people who think paul oakenfold appeared out of nowhere creating 
some new music style. oh wait, that sound like you.

what the hell has that punk ever innovated? not a damn thing. what 
game is he ahead of? the "lets capitalize on bullshit music 
derived from the good music i used to be into so i can make mad 
loot and ruin dance music" game? cause hes WAYYYYYYY ahead on that 
one.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Can cleveland support?

 My Opinion, for what its worth:
 
 The Oakenfold show will probably fuck Moda and the
 Ferry Corsten show (unfortunately as ferry's
 probably
 a much better DJ...I've never seen him so I can't
 comment) because Mike and Evan are definnately
 promoting Oakey a lot more than Moda's promoting
 Corsten and Rap (granted that tour is sponsored, so
 Moda _probably_ doesn't have nearly the financial
 stake in that show than they would otherwise.  All
 the
 house heads will be at Little Louie Vega (myself
 included)...and all the freaks will be at Third Eye
 (again myself included...gonna have to hit two shows
 that night)

I dunno, I've hear some really sketchy mixes of his. And also I've got one set from CD that was recorded live, and when you listen to one transition you can easily tell theres a change in sound levels and possibly Mono->Stereo->Mono difference as he spliced it and redid it. Sides, Oakenfold doesn't play as much melodic pooper.

I've only seen one Oakenpoop flyer, but I ran into a few ones posted for Rap and Corsten, so that's not entirely the case.

I dunno, is Playstation's name that I see in all the ads for the Moda show there for free? Believe me, theres a sponsor or two.

Big, Loud Clubs Seek New Glitter

Miles Ladin for The New York Times
Club Deep opened in September and will soon be followed by five more clubs
in the same neighborhood.

By JULIA CHAPLIN

Published: November 9, 2003
A=20

Nightclubs and Cabarets
Music
New York City

=20

Amy Dickerson for The New York Times
Among the new clubs that have opened or are planned in the Chelsea area are
Avalon in the former Limelight space, and Crobar. Callin Fortis, left, says
he and his partner, Ken Smith, right, want Crobar to be "like a creative
playground," with acrobats and an art gallery.


Miles Ladin for The New York Times
Christine Renee, a D.J., at the spin table in the unisex bathroom at Avalon=
.


=A0DIDN'T invite her," said Eve Salvail, a model with a dragon tattoo on the
side of her head, who gets $500 to linger a few hours and look cool at
Avalon, the latest incarnation of the Episcopal church in Chelsea once know=
n
as Limelight.

It was 3 a.m. on a recent Sunday, and Ms. Salvail, a part-time employee
known as a tastemaker ? a k a eye candy ? watched helplessly from her free
V.I.P. table in the hip-hop room while the uninvited woman, who looked like
the Colombian pop star Shakira with streaked hair and a mini-kilt, wrapped
herself around a stripper pole. When the woman began a deafening tap dance
in her knee-high boots, two male models in Ms. Salvail's entourage gathered
their free glasses of vodka and cranberry juice, slid out of the banquette
and left.

"She's scaring people away," Ms. Salvail said. "I wish she'd just sit down.=
"

So it goes on the front lines of New York's latest attempt to revive the
glittery era of huge dance clubs ? that halcyon 80's moment of celebrities,
downtown artists and well-dressed nobodies mixing under strobe lights at
Danceteria and the Palladium.

A new batch of entrepreneurs is betting that chic New Yorkers, after years
of holing up in low-key lounges, are ready to hit the dance floor with the
masses again. Over the next four months, no fewer than five clubs ? each
with room for hundreds or even thousands of dancers and featuring
new-generation diversions like bungee-jumping cocktail waiters and raw-food
kitchens ? will open in two square blocks of West Chelsea. The area ?
bounded by 10th and 11th Avenues and 26th and 28th Streets ? is already
thick with art galleries. Now it bids to become the center of New York
clubland.

"Tenth Avenue is great, because it's wide enough for limos and Escalades to
pull up outside," said Noah Tepperberg, who is opening one of the clubs, so
far unnamed, on 10th Avenue near 27th next month.

Among the others to come are Spirit, which is to open this month in the old
Twilo space on 27th Street; Crobar, a branch of a club with sites in Miami
and Chicago, which plans to open next month; and Quo, due in February, whos=
e
name, in a very loose translation from the Latin, means "where it's at," it=
s
owners say.

Applications to add more clubs are pouring in, according to Community Board
4, which oversees West Chelsea. They would include an Indian-theme nightclu=
b
and a dance club on 16th Street. Add the Avalon and Club Deep, both of whic=
h
opened between Avenue of the Americas and Fifth Avenue in September, along
with lounges that were already in the neighborhood (Lot 61, Glass, Bungalow
8, the Coral Room), and the Studio 54 question is, Who is going to fill all
these places?

David Rabin, president of the New York Nightlife Association and an owner o=
f
Lotus, a lounge on West 14th Street, said: "I can't figure out how all thes=
e
places are going to make money. New York has been hit so hard by
unemployment, particularly in the finance and dot-com industries that drive
trendy night life. If one or two were opening I'd think, `Well, yeah,
maybe.' But this many at once is really puzzling."

A bigger question, perhaps, is how the new discos will escape the kinds of
drugged-out club kids who, in legions, contributed to the demise of New
York's last dance-club wave. That boom, in the 1990's, was a dark chapter
riddled with drugs, violence and elephant pants. After a crackdown on clubs
by the Giuliani administration, which made it nearly impossible to get the
cabaret licenses required for dancing, night crawlers retreated to small
lounges catering to a privileged few. Dancing became a naughty and
spontaneous act for the drunken and daring, performed atop cocktail tables
and on banquettes. (Places like Lotus and Bungalow 8 regularly replaced the
stiletto-punctured upholstery.)

The empire built by the club owner Peter Gatien crumbled when federal agent=
s
labeled his Limelight "a drug supermarket" and shut it in 1996. In a
separate case, the club's star promoter, Michael Alig, pleaded guilty to
manslaughter for killing a clubgoer who was a reputed drug dealer (the
subject of the recent film "Party Monster"). And in 2001, Twilo, a big blac=
k
room with all-night D.J. parties, was also closed by the authorities. A
favorite of glow-stick-twirling ravers, it kept an ambulance to run victims
of drug overdoses to emergency rooms.

Some old club hands say it is going to be hard to change a business that ha=
s
habitually thrived on hard drugs and bad behavior. "Where are they going to
get a club crowd that isn't young and on drugs?" asked Steven Lewis, who wa=
s
a director of Danceteria, the Palladium and Club USA, and who went to priso=
n
himself for nine months on drug charges. "I'm sure the 22-year-olds that do
go out and are creative and cool would rather be at a divey rock club in th=
e
Lower East Side or Williamsburg."

Residents of the club district are essentially powerless to block them,
community board members say, because the area is zoned for manufacturing.
"Many residents oppose the opening of all these nightclubs," said Kevin
Kossi, a co-chairman of Community Board 4. But instead of trying to block
the issuance of liquor licenses and risk being overruled by state
authorities, Mr. Kossi said the board has persuaded the clubs to help
control the likely throngs of pedestrians, the heavy late-night street
traffic and the thumping music.

But some say the clubs will bolster the area. "It's better to have clubs,
which are a controlled grittiness, than what used to be there, which was a
derelict area with prostitutes and people having sex in cars," said Danny
Emerman, an owner of Glass, a lounge, and Bottino, a restaurant, both on
10th Avenue.

Almost all the owners interviewed for this article said they were trying to
attract "an older, more sophisticated crowd," a code phrase that some of
them acknowledged means "no 21-year-old `bridge and tunnelers' on Ecstasy."

Callin Fortis, an owner of Crobar, said the club's entertainment would
influence the behavior of its crowd. "We're not going to book one trance
D.J. for 14 hours in a big dark room," he said. "It's going to be like a
creative playground." Crobar, which will hold 2,750 people, will feature
live performances, an art gallery, acrobats on trampolines and what he
described as bungee jumpers delivering cocktails. (Next door to Crobar, a
branch of the "upscale" topless club Scores plans to open early next month.=
)

Like many of the other new clubs, Crobar is being designed to feel less lik=
e
a giant disco and more like a series of lounges. It will have a V.I.P.
lounge, an ultra-V.I.P. lounge and several small rooms catering to differen=
t
subsets and designed by fashion companies including Heatherette (the
flamboyant fashion-techno crowd), As Four (a downtown rock crowd) and
Supreme (alternative hip-hop and street wear).

Richie Rich, a designer for Heatherette who was once Michael Alig's
assistant at Limelight, said the new clubs would have it easier because
indiscriminate drug consumption is no longer so acceptable. "Now it's becom=
e
cool to get up earlier and be professional," he said, although he
acknowledged that he may just be growing older.

Robert Wootton, an owner of Spirit, the 35,000-square-foot club in the
former Twilo space, is betting that the neo-clubgoer enjoys tarot readings,
astrology and organic foods. Testing the outer limits of a concept, Spirit
will combine nightclubbing and New Age. It will be divided into zones: Body=
,
a dance area with "uplifting" house music; Mind, a spa with aromatherapy an=
d
massage; and Soul, an organic and raw-food restaurant. It will have no
V.I.P. areas. "The concept doesn't really make sense on paper," Mr. Wootton
said. He said he had "no idea" if it would make money, but it was something
he felt called upon to do.

The competition is heating up among club owners to enlist the city's top
promoters, models and night-life regulars to draw in the many thousands of
paying customers they will need to stay in business. On the weekends, Avalo=
n
pays more than 100 people, including promoters and eye candy, to pull not
just a crowd, but the right crowd.

"It's like 50 dogs fighting over a bone, and the bone is the A-list," said
Ronnie Madra, who promotes parties at Lotus and Avalon and is considering
offers from several of the new clubs. One of his tactics is to hire what he
calls "extroverted beautiful people" like Ms. Salvail, whose sole purpose i=
s
to hang out and look good, a job description at other clubs, too, like Plai=
d
and Lotus.

(Page 3 of 3)


"I say here's $200, all you can drink and a table to fill with a few of you=
r
good-looking friends," Mr. Madra said. "When the average person walks past
and sees them there having fun, it makes the place seem a lot more
`happening.' "

On a recent Saturday night at Avalon, such social engineering seemed to be
paying off. The club, which has a $25 cover charge, was mobbed at the
entrance, with a line down the block. Inside, the Habitrail-like hallways
were jammed with Japanese and German tourists and other curiosity seekers.
But a few glitches were apparent: the lounge crowd and the techno dancers
were not getting along.

Up in one of the three V.I.P. skyboxes, to which entry could be gained only
with the password "Brazil," Morgan Handbury, 21, a model from Canada who
moved to New York City last month, was clutching her cocktail. "You can get
this big club thing anywhere in the world ? Miami, South Africa," said Ms.
Handbury, who was wearing Levi's and a lingerie top. "I'd much rather be in
a small lounge without all these random people. I hate the lighting in here=
,
and the music is awful."

She craved a smoke. "but there's no way I'm walking through that crowd to
get outside," she said.

In a bar off the main dance area where the D.J. Josh Wink was spinning,
Tyson Gorrie, 28, a lawyer who recently moved to Manhattan, was wigging out=
.
"There's too much of a money vibe here, man," he said. "I'm not into it.
It's like a Euro place where you've got to buy a bottle just to get a girl
to talk to you."

A couple of blocks away, Club Deep, which caters mostly to a clientele from
outside Manhattan, was gelling better. The two-level space with five V.I.P.
areas was packed at 1 a.m. Young men in Von Dutch trucker hats and leather
pants and young women in tight spandex tops inhaled cocktails and bobbed
their blow-dried hair to Chingy's "Right Thurr."

The club, decorated with amber-tinted mirrors, candles and several giant
photographs of half-naked women, looked like a trendy lounge, only much
bigger. A large dance floor with spinning colored lights was deserted.
Lauren Greenfield, a 24-year-old stripper from Queens, stood by the bar wit=
h
her friend Jennifer Fernandez, 28, a high school teacher from Edgewater,
N.J., who was celebrating her birthday.

"At most places you go out to, 80 percent of the guys are going to be duds,
which leaves 20 percent who are eligible, right?" said Ms. Greenfield, who
said she had no intention of putting a toe on the dance floor. "Now at a bi=
g
club, that 20 percent is going to be a much higher number. I want to go up
to the V.I.P. area where the rich guys are."

In the V.I.P. area directly in her line of vision, Nick Arsenis, 23, an
accountant from Queens, and a 24-year-old friend, Scott, who would not give
his last name, were sizing up the crowd from behind a velvet rope as they
mixed cocktails from carafes of orange and cranberry juice and a $300 bottl=
e
of vodka. "We don't like to dance," said Mr. Arsenis, who wore a button-up
shirt and jeans and had gelled hair.

Scott, who looked roughly the same, nodded. "We just like to sit up here
with bottles and meet cute girls," he said.

Well it seems he is able to take pieces of shit and sell them for ten

It looks like he gets the respect from the people who enjoy his music, and 
obviously doesn't get respect from the people who don't. That doesn't seem 
fair to you?

>hoodwinked kids on drugs into liking crap music? .

Hoodwinked kids on drugs? I'm sure some kids are fucked up on drugs and buy 
anything their dad can afford. Or maybe they go through trends and phases 
like any other human being.

...or maybe there are actually kids who enjoy his music? Maybe the quality 
of music shouldn't be based on anything but an individual's personal 
experience? ...and maybe some individuals care more about how they feel 
about the music they are listening to as opposed to how they appear to the 
culture snobs?

It seems we just disagree on our philosphies about music and people. You 
seem to think it can be categorized into "good" and "bad". I just don't see 
how it can be that simple. That seems more mathematical, not artistic.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

I agree on that, but I think the famine has allready begun. IMHO, it will
pick up as the new year rolls along, hopefully with a change in Political
powers. Me and trout saw theres a budding scene in SW Ohio, but its composed
of those raw candy (and OTHER SHADY) elements many here are trying to get
away from! People will come out if they've never been to a party or club
before, soley for the music...but they need to go out with some1 who can
have fun the organic way (not chemical ;-) ) and that can showem the door.

Best of luck to anyone trying to start a club around here for a bit...

It might take a lil while to download but its worth it!

Its the funkier side of drum and bass. I think I am going to do another mix 
with some much harder tracks in it, soon once school stops punching me in 
the face.
Tell me what you think!!! I can take it. TRUST!

Subject: {pb-cle} new WALKINGSTICK bio

Old skool ragga junglist DJ Walkingstick exemplifies the new class of
> emerging talented electronic music producers and DJs destined for
> success. Better known as twenty-four year old Brian Burgess to those
> close to him, Walkingstick is already gathering notoriety in both the
> national and international DJ circuit. He is originally a native of Ohio
> but now hails from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, remaining a constant and
> evolving force in the local electronica and jungle communities. When
> behind the decks, Walkingstick commands the dance floor with an aural
> assault of drum heavy tracks guaranteed to move the crowd. But recently
> he has found another passion  music production and remastery. Already
> dropping multiple dubplates and affiliated with major jungle crews, the
> future looks promising for this young dedicated junglist soldier.
> 
> Walkingstick surfaced in the Pittsburgh electronic music scene in 1999
> along with Bedford Williamson as cofounders of Total Xperience
> Productions. Their first event, No Doze, garnished rave reviews from
> local promoters and resulted in instant respect for the two. Over the
> next few years Total Xperience hosted several more events, among
> them High Tide, Iceburgh, Homegrown and the memorable Humble.
> Another event is also in the works, called Gifted and planned for
> December 2003. Brian and Bedford established the Total Xperience name
> from the ground-up and commanded immediate esteem with their superior
> behind-the-scenes production and excellent promotion. In addition to
> throwing events, Walkingstick gained popularity DJing all over the area
> on numerous lineups. Now a five-year DJ veteran, his unique high-paced
> blend of old skool and ragga jungle, dancehall, reggae and hip hop
> energizes the crowd and assaults the senses. Walkingsticks reputation as
> a quality DJ and honest promoter led to high regard and a professional
> relationship with DJ Carlos Soulslinger, the driving force behind New 
York-
> based Jungle Sky / Liquid Sky Records.
> 
> Walkingstick then shifted his concentration from acting as promoter and 
DJ
> towards honing his skills behind the decks. Music is and has been the
> biggest influence in Brians life, and one can easily detect his love for
> beats when he graces the turntables. Walkingsticks earliest musical
> influences came from various genres including hip hop, punk, jazz, funk,
> soul and rock. He prides himself in his uncanny ability to dig in the
> crates, finding not only the ragga classics and anthems but also obscure
> tracks that most listeners have not heard before and probably wont
> again. Walkingstick leads where others follow; specializing in a genre
> with much less exposure compared to the new wave of bass-heavy drum and
> bass. The distinctiveness and energy in his sets continue to lead him all
> over the world, as Walkingstick has now played in three continents  
North
> America, South America and Europe.
> 
> Showcasing his skills on the national and international levels,
> Walkingstick has played events with some of the most popular DJs and at
> some of the best venues in the world. He has performed at New York
> Citys Konkrete Jungle, Aberdeen, Scotlands Jungle Nation, Puerto
> Ricos Astral Phenomenon, and on three publicized tours throughout the
> countryof Brazil with another one coming in 2004. Ecosystem v.2, the
> high-profile, world-class event in Brazil in 2002, became the major
> stepping-stone in Walkingsticks DJ career. It was his opportunity to
> shine and he grasped the chance with open arms, as his flawless display 
of
> mixing, track selection and energy captured the attention of major DJs,
> promoters, and most importantly the Brazilian public. The embrace of
> Brazilian club culture led to the subsequent tours all over the country.
> Walkingstick became the first and only DJ from the United States to
> play The Bass at Club Susi in
> Transe, the first and longest-running all drum and bass club night in Sao
> Paulo. In addition, he has graced the decks in Rio de Janeiro,
> Terisopolis, Porto Alegre, Sao Lourenco do Sul, and along with legendary
> MC TC Izlam at Clube Hype in the city of Manaus, at Ecosystem v.2. 
While
> on tour in 2003 Walkingstick became quite the celebrity too, as he was 
the
> feature subject of newspaper articles in two of Brazils largest
> newspapers, O Globo in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulos Folha de Sao
> Paulo. His popularity there is a tribute to his hard work and dedication
> in the global old skool / ragga jungle scene.
> 
> Walkingstick did not want to quit at simply spinning other peoples music
> as he knew he could do more. He could feel an uncontrollable urge in him
> to express himself through music production. Thus he made the logical
> progression from simply disc jockeying to producing and pressing his own
> tracks. A large part of his progress can be attributed to his
> affiliation with and guidance from DJ Soul Slinger and Jungle Sky
> Records. Renowned MC TC Izlam signed Walkingstick to his New York-based,
> booming jungle label Hip Step and also remains a large influence in
> Brians musical career. But in 2003 he made what could prove to be the
> best professional move in his life  signing with Jungle Riddim
> (http://www.jungleriddim.com).
> 
> San Diego, California-based Jungle Riddim is a ragga / hardcore
> dancehall label owned by Daniel Clark and comprised of a talented group 
of
> DJs and producers. Members of the label roster include Oscar da Grouch,
> Mainframe and Red October, among others. The crew produces, mixes and
> remixes tracks while encouraging its members to collaborate and learn 
from
> each other in order to push their sound to new levels. Each DJ and
> producer on the roster has a unique sound and brings years of DJ and
> production experience to the table. The label has issued some of the more
> powerful and unique jungle tracks to be heard in a long time, and many
> more original pressings are in store for the immediate future.
> Walkingstick himself has a slew of original dubplates in production with
> late 2003 to early 2004 expected release dates. The crews positive
> message and the cooperation of its members ensure that Jungle Riddim
> will remain a major force in American jungle for years to come. Expect
> only the best from Walkingstick and Jungle Riddim, as the new revolution
> in American drum and bass is on the way
> 
> This winter, look for Walkingstick in a city near you as he goes on
> another large tour. He will be leaving on Christmas Eve 2003 and has his
> first set of dates are scheduled in Brazil. Following the South American
> performances he is headed back to the states to begin his U.S. tour in
> Miami. Then its off to the West Coast for touring and performances with
> Jungle Riddim! More info to come as details are known.

Subject: {pb-cle} Brief MEatrik/Brian Aneurism review

 Incredible. Absolutely wonderful night of music.

Maetrik and Brian played some of the most interesting
music I've ever heard...smooth flow, great records,
awesome groove, lots of great tech on top. Definately
up there with the best sets I've ever seen, and a
treat i won't forget for a while.

Magda closing out the night was just as much of a
treat...crazy more experimental stuff...bad ass tracks
without a doubt.

Awesome night all around...thanks to Dan and all
involved...Lookin' forward to Matthew Dear.

Kinda jumping in late on this topic, but...

I'd bet a lot of the people who wind up listening to Derrick started off
by listening to Paul.  Like it or not, he serves a really useful purpose,
and he does what he does (apparently) better than anyone else.  Topping
that off with the fact he's a decent guy?

Seems silly to hate him.

Its paycheck envy. 
Is he worth the money, not even close. But then again I don't have to
pay to watch him if I don't want to.

The truth is he is a bridge between mainstream music and edm. He pulls
from a huge pool of people.
This sticking to your "genre" crap is annoying. Play what you like. If
you have to throw in some  crap in order to get the attention of some
uneducated(musically) punters then go for it.

Anyone that can draw more people to the music the better.
Even Volkswagen and ford are helping some. :)

And this notion that you (any of you) would not "sell out" and play
polka if it meant you would get 100 grand to go and buy any of the music
you wanted is just a lie.
All thought you may be lying to yourself and are unaware =)

Your dj's your job is to play what you are paid to play. The rave scene
is different the EDM scene is a little different. The club scene is only
going to pay for you if you play enough shit that enough people will
show to cover the cost. The more diverse your crowd the more neutral
pussy dripping crap you have to play.

The underground mentality of "You are only worthy of are respect and
attention when you are unknown and starving." is pretty weak.

NO NO NO NO DJ is worth what he makes. Period.

 Incredible. Absolutely wonderful night of music.

Maetrik and Brian played some of the most interesting
music I've ever heard...smooth flow, great records,
awesome groove, lots of great tech on top. Definately
up there with the best sets I've ever seen, and a
treat i won't forget for a while.

Magda closing out the night was just as much of a
treat...crazy more experimental stuff...bad ass tracks
without a doubt.

Awesome night all around...thanks to Dan and all involved...Lookin'
forward to Matthew Dear.

<<Anyone that can draw more people to the music the better. Even Volkswagen and ford are helping
some. :)>>

Not necessarily. What they're inviting is a potential dilution of the artform. If "artists" start
gearing their music in such a way that it will be co-opted by mass-media and specifically
advertisers, then you risk cheapening the value of your artform simply for monetary gain. Hence the
problem that most people into our type of music have with mainstream pop...it's less about the music
and more about the business of making something that will sell.

It's the ages-old dilemma between being an artist and being a shill for big business.

(Shill: "One who poses as a satisfied customer or an enthusiastic gambler to dupe bystanders into
participating in a swindle")

Most people 'round here think that Mr. Oakenfold has abandoned the art that got him his start and
gone completely to 'the dark side' where profit is valued more than substance. He's OPENLY admitted
that he's interested in the type of music he plays having mass-market crossover appeal. Hence the
craptasticness of songs like "Starry Eyed Surprise" hitting the mainstream.

<<...you (any of you) would not "sell out" and play polka if it meant you would get 100 grand to go
and buy any of the music you wanted is just a lie.>>

I sincerely doubt that. I venture that most people who've commented on this topic thusfar:
1) wouldn't position themselves in a place where they'd be forced to decide between an enormous
paycheck and playing the music they love.
2) if they found themselves in that situation, would do so with tongue firmly planted in cheek, and
not buy into their own self-serving bullshit story about the music the way Mr. Oakenfold does.

<<Your dj's your job is to play what you are paid to play.>>

Not necessarily. A radio DJ is paid to play from a playlist. A traditional danceclub DJ is paid to
keep people on the floor and/or at the bar.

EDM DJ's differ slightly in that they're also interested in developing the culture and artform of
deejaying and introducing their crowd to new and interesting styles of music and new artists.

Mr. Oakenfold has within his power the ability to open people up to truly groundbreaking, quality
music. Instead of using that opportunity, he continues to perform like an organ-grinder, playing the
same mediocre tracks that were new and semi-fresh in 1998 to ever widening crowds who don't know
better or should and don't care, and he continues to cash-in in the process.

Do I think what he does is wholly without merit? Not really, because I think, as I've said before,
he provides an entry point for those looking for a way in to this type of music. Those really
interested in the music will quickly grow tired of his stagnant style and progress into electronic
music deeper and gain a better understanding of the history of dance music, electric and organic.

<<The underground mentality of "You are only worthy of are respect and attention when you are
unknown and starving." is pretty weak.>>

I agree with this to a point. A great deal of that feeling is also attributable to how you handle
yourself and recognize how you got where you are and how you help bring those around you up with
you.

<<NO NO NO NO DJ is worth what he makes. Period.>>

I'm worth every penny that I've ever made deejaying, and fuck you for saying otherwise.

Don't be insulted. I love the music I love all aspects of it. But from

OH! SHIT! mah bad....for what it's worth, I didn't really mean that "fuck you" part in a serious
way, either.

I read that the wrong way. Yeah, you're right. I don't think I can fathom any DJ legitimately being
able to command $10k a night.

then again, i really can't see that a promoter can justify making that much money in a night either.
i mean, given the 50/50 proposition of where the money SHOULD go, (aside from the fact that, yeah,
people shouldn't be paying $20 to get in to see one dj) i'd rather that money go to the "performer"
than the promoter, be it oakenfold or not....

Subject: {pb-cle} Sauce, Havana edition...post attempt #2

Yeah I hadnt had a chance to respond to this till now
but Friday was amazing.  I honestly cant say I had
that much fun or danced that much since Norm Talley
was in town.  The music was great and Arnie even
played my Fade tune for me.

Jwans track selection was great and so was Arnies.
They were a great combo to have play together.  Jim
didnt let a soul leave the dance floor each time he
jumped on. I didnt see that place clear out till like
2:15 or so.  It was packed all the way till Jim
stopped playing.  

I just want to thank Jim for last week and in advance
for this week for letting Sauces DJs have a Foster
Home for two weeks. Greatly Appreciated!

Also thanks to all my friends for following us this
past week and hopefully next.  So yeah this Friday at
Havana, the Selecta and Ed Um.  

Thanks!
Cristina

***FALLS OFF CHAIR***
 
They are touring the states this month. I can't imagine they'd do a live PA in Peabody's, but if they are you'd be the idiot of the century for missing it.  Their DJ sets can go either way, but are usually worth catching no less. If any part of Hybrid is in Cleveland, I will for sure be there.

Just got word that Hybrid may be at Peabody's on November 18!

Can someone please confirm?!?!?

Is it Mike Truman doing a DJ set by himself, or Truman, Healings and Mullins doing a live pa? 

Is this part of the Morning SciFi tour? 

Who's the promoter for this?? 

Info please!!!

i dont buy it. perhaps im lucky because im friends with so many 
ill people, but none of them have migrated from crap trance to 
techno. thats just not the way it goes for 99.9% of the people out 
there. im sure there's some crossover just because of the sheer 
number of people who listen to dance music. anyway, why didnt the 
UK charts need watered down shit in the first place? obviously 
there were quite a few detroit and chicago tunes that made the top 
10 when they first came out, there was no need for crappy watered 
down poop music for people to be able to understand the better 
quality music......

>Topping

being a decent person doesnt mean shit to me. i would expect most 
non-asshole people to be alright on a personal level. it doesnt 
make his music any better, or his motives any less irritating.

but this is not the point. i have no qualms with good artists 
getting paid what theyre worth. they deserve it. oakenfold hasnt 
been an innovator, he hasnt done shit himself worth anything in 
well over 10 years, he doesnt even get voted to the top of shite 
dj mags' top 100 deejay polls. WTF is he getting paid for? its a 
big joke. hes the brittney spears of dance music, all style, no 
substance.

thats a horrible sacrifice to make. there are plenty of ways to 
play decent tunes that people have heard before. you dont have to 
play garbage records to get people into good music. it definitely 
does help if you give them some touchstone, but make it a good 
record. play "blue monday" or "billie jean" or "tainted love", 
etc. 

>Anyone that can draw more people to the music the better.
>Even Volkswagen and ford are helping some. :)

yeah im a big fan of people using good music in movies, 
commercials, etc. i truly think that helps things out. but for 
every good piece of music used, theres hundreds of crap tracks 
used, and people dont know enough about the music to tell the 
difference. 

>And this notion that you (any of you) would not "sell out" and 
play
>polka if it meant you would get 100 grand to go and buy any of

hey, if someone wanted to pay me mad loot to keep playing the 
stuff im playing, id take it. but when that trend subsided, i 
wouldnt start playing other stuff to keep making the money.

i dont think that giving in to the LCD dance music is a good way 
to make money in the long run. its a good way to make money off of 
people who are hip to something because its a trend. building a 
musically knowledgable fan base for good records will definitely 
pay off in the long run, those people keep coming back, trend or 
no trend. 

>The underground mentality of "You are only worthy of are respect 
and

i never said that. i said that derrick may is worth everything he 
gets paid. same with jeff mills. those guys have invented shit 
that people have been pirating for years. 

>NO NO NO NO DJ is worth what he makes. Period.

i dont think thats true. a real artist's work is damn near 
invaluable. theres no price that can be assigned to the feeling 
you get when you hear "strings of life".

see, this is why i liked ford using "no UFOs". it was really a 
great song, and its appeal was in its essence as opposed to its 
style. but even the poppier "days gone by" used by mitsubishi was 
not a bad track for what it is.

a friend of mine made this funny poster years ago when oakie was 
playing here with all these really great quotes of him talking 
about "getting paid" and "taking over america". IIRC it caused him 
a decent amount of beef. but whatever. i cant imagine what someone

tongue firmly planted in cheek, and

a few of the examples i pointed out in this email are great 
examples of someone who does get paid without sacrificing what 
they want to do. it is absolutely possible to do, though obviously 
it doesnt happen very frequently. playing cheesy prog/trance crap 
is a good way to "take the easy way" considering how many more 
well paid morons there are playing that crap.

this is absolutely right. as much as it is dance music, it is also 
art. make me think of the ninja tunes "fuck dance, let's art" 
tagline. art and dance do mix though, theyre not mutually 
exclusive.

i still dont see that happening. entering into a dumbed down genre 
of music means setting your sights low. shit, look at all the wack 
pop punk around these days. what percentage of the morons that 
listen to that shit do you think are even aware of who the stooges 
or the velvet underground are? i think its a very small 
percentage.

ha. i want more people to list this as the genre of music i spin. 
anyway, everyone should come out tonight, ive got a massive amount 
of really fanstastic records recently which are begging to get 
played. lots of old disco and synthpop/newwave, some detroit house 
and some classic detroit techno. it should be really really fun.

Subject: {pb-cle} HYBRID LIVE in Cleveland

They are a hybrid of deep progressive breaks and of progressive house. They are a hybrid of live performance and DJ performance. They are HYBRID, and they are coming to Cleveland Tuesday November 18! 

Supporting DJ performance by Deviant of HeadRush Music. More details to come.

Peabody's 2083 East 21st St. downtown, behind the RascalHouse

Best of all: It's $10 !!!!

Hybrid is Mike Truman and Chris Healings from Swansea South Wales. They are the accomplished architects of house and progressive breakbeat who ventured further beyond the ecstatic knee-jerk response of the dancefloor by fusing their beats with powerful orchestral and cinematic soundscapes. 

Hybrid formed back in 1993 after bonding over Truman's remix of Pink Floyd's 'Another Brick In The Wall. They debut LP, 'Wide Angle' (released 1999) and its sister release 'Wider Angle' (remixes and live recordings of Japan tour) sold a total of 100,000 copies world wide. This lead to Mike and Chris DJing and performing live in the UK, Asia, Australia and USA. 

The deep lush strings of Wide Angle were recorded in Russia courtesy of the 90-piece Moscow Federal Orchestra. The album's emotional hit was both subtle and timeless. "We like making music that will last," explains Healings. "Music that isn't disposable. We want people to listen to it over and over again in the future." "Music you can play before you go out and listen to when you chillout," continues Truman. 

Hybrid opened this decade with 'Kid 2000' featuring the sensuous vocals of The Pretenders Chrissie Hynde. "When you hear very formulated European house music the emotional content is almost nil," explains Truman. "You know exactly where its going, you can even tell where the samples are from. There's nothing in it to make you happy or melancholic. We aim to instil a strong emotional content into our music." 

The outstanding reviews and success of their debut went cosmic:Hybrid, support act for MOBY in America, are collecting celebrity admirers. GILLIAN ANDERSON of the X Files and rocker TOMMY LEE hung around their dressing room like starstruck teenagers. The Sun October 2000. The Moby US tour (2000) lasted nine weeks with 48 performances. 

Here in 2003, their second LP, Morning Sci-Fi, is the next ingenious step forward. The task of crafting new influences around their ever-mutating breakbeats has been a lengthy progression. "We've been listening to absolutely anything other than dance music, explains Healings. I suppose that is because dance music is so ingrained into what we do naturally. We've been listening to stuff like The Doves, Aqualung, Radiohead, Soulwax, lots of jangly indie guitar bands and classical music, particularly the work of Arvo Part and Alexander Gretchaninov." 

The live guitars and some of the bass sections were courtesy of Adam Taylor, Richard Thair (Redsnapper) supplied the drums for 'Marrakech' and 'Think I'm Still Awake'; John Creamer opens the album with a spoken word intro exploring the nature of his dreams. All the strings were recorded last December in St Petersburg courtesy of the world-class Hermitage Orchestra. 

Yet one of the albums strangest collaborations came about after Hybrid's manager met New Order's Peter Hook in Manchester last July where they both ranted about the merit of a good bass line in a dance track. "Non of these bloody dance remixers ever use my bass lines," argued Hook. "I put in all this time and effort and they use Bernards vocals but they don't bloody use my bass." 

The following week Hybrid sent over a couple of tracks and Hook rang back and agreed to play his "bloody bass" on 'True To Form' and 'High As A Skyscraper'. Thus the album was complete. Now Hybrid's resounding second LP is raising the next nagging question. Is the third album ready yet? 

Hybrid has also remixed over 40 artists including Radiohead, Alanis Morissette, Future Sound Of London and Moby.

Subject: {pb-cle} Define Sell-out, PLEASE

What are the stipulations that cause you to call one a
"sell-out"?  Also, what keeps someone from being a
"sell-out"?  

I think once we define exactly what we are all
refering too, it maybe be aparent that no one is
truely a sell-out if they are doing what they want to
do.  To you, Oakenfold may be a sell-out, but he may
be doing exactly what he wants to do, which in any
scenario, by doing what one wants to do, would not
make him a sell-out.  

Simply stated, he makes enough money to do what HE
wants to and he can also afford (in many ways more
then just monetarily) to say no to a venture as well,
especially if he does not want to do it.  Therefore,
he is most likely doing exactly what he wants to do,
does that make him a sell-out?  To not like what he
produces is alright as long as you respect him for
what he has accomplished, Business or Musicaly, he has
us all topped, accept it.

This was probably one of my favorite nights out all year....the style of grooves being played just suited my taste darn near perfectly.  As usual, from my 'dancing' perspective....perfect for a lot of footwork and flow, plenty of interesting techy elements, and hard to find mixing flaws (not sure I caught any).  Honestly good, good stuff.  Magda unfortunately I could not stay for, wish I could have. 
 
I second that thanks.  *Great job*

Incredible. Absolutely wonderful night of music.

Maetrik and Brian played some of the most interesting
music I've ever heard...smooth flow, great records,
awesome groove, lots of great tech on top. Definately
up there with the best sets I've ever seen, and a
treat i won't forget for a while.

Magda closing out the night was just as much of a
treat...crazy more experimental stuff...bad ass tracks
without a doubt.

Awesome night all around...thanks to Dan and all involved...Lookin'

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Define Sell-out, PLEASE

Make more money then me. Sell Out
Spin music I don't like. Sell Out.
Being popular. Sell Out.
Playing anything that is not designed to be enjoyed by .000025 % of the
population. Sell Out.
Try and move the scene out of the dirty, candy infested, crack headed
venues. Sell Out.
Disagreeing with me. Sell Out.

That should sum it up :)
Not getting into the current trendy dance genre that is "rocking the edm
scene"

In case nobody noticed edm is just as trendy as pop. One season its DRUM
IN BASS, then Prog, then BreakBeat, Then HardCore... Repeat until end of
time and taking into account the 1000 sub genres of each of these.

Joking Aside...
A sell out to me is anyone that changes himself for just the sake of
money. 
If someone loves experimental .75 bpm ethereal, anthem breakbeat trance
;) and realizes they are going to have to spin other shit if they want
to pay the bills then all power to them. If this other stuff ends up
making them crazy loot then fucking A go with it. Just because you make
bank at your job doesn't mean you can't also be into something that
doesn't pay. The current attitude of you can only have 1 style and it
has to be all you do and you can't spin crap if its to make a pay check
is stupid. I have better things to do with my free time then spend them
dj'ing music I don't like. But hey if you can make a career out of
playing to the masses then by all means go for it. As long as you don't
stop liking the shit you like then your not a sell out. Money Talks.
Hypothetically if I go out and make 100 grand spinning music I can't
stand and the only reason I did it was for the 100,000 grand that I
would make in 4 hours then so what. People loved it. Its why they bought
the ticket. If I then went home and throw down a set that I couldn't get
paid to spin somewhere then does that still make me a sell out. 

Money Talks. Just because you go to work doesn't mean you lost heart or
are deserving people ripping you apart for it. 
As I stated I love the music. But this is a business and I honestly
don't understand this starving artist mentality.

Pay for what you like. If you don't like the dj don't pay to see him. 

My 2 Cents.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Define Sell-out, PLEASE

Okay, first off, I have seen Oakenfold live.  I really didnt pay 
to see him, but he got some of the ticket price, I'm sure.  I 
could have cared less during his set, I just pounded back the 7 
dollar budweisers at the arena while waiting for the Chemical 
Brothers.  When Oakie was done, sasha and digweed came on... 
again, someone who i paid for that i really could have cared less, 
but I actually appreciated what they were doing, it wasn't 
completely boring as hell, even with all the visuals that oakie 
had that sasha/digweed didnt it was boring and uninspiring.  To 
the point at hand... he pretty much makes all his money off 
playing OTHER PEOPLE'S SHIT.  Yes, he has the perfecto label and 
all and invites the artists to be a part of it, it's because he 
has BANK.  Why doesn't he tour with the other perfecto artists and 
split all the money evenly?  That's why he's a sell out.  
Greedy/Individualist when it comes to his performance.  Tell me 
that if Shawn Rudiman got booked somewhere in america for a good 
price that he wouldn't invite all the guys in Technoir to come 
spin with him.  I realize he's over in Europe right now, but I'm 
sure if he were sitting on the bank that oakenfold was, he'd take 
the whole crew.  That's not a sell out.  Is seeing any one 
performer worth a 25 or 50 dollar price tag when the margin is so 
great for a DJ vs a band?  Especially when it's not in a concert 
setting where you have mad amounts of equipment that need moved, 
he has a record bag and a plane ticket... and now, with final 
scratch, one could have a laptop and a plane ticket.  That's not 
too much to ask.  Just like sports at the professional level are 
overpriced.  Yes, you have multimillion dollar venues, but look at 
the team salary levels, in 2 or 3 years of salaries, you could 
have built Heinz field and had no tax burden on the city.  Anyone 
that knows about the Gini curve will know that this is just 
inherent behavior in capitalist society.  As elitism rises, the 
distribution of income shifts.  Rich get richer, the poor get 
poorer.  We aspire after some elusive, nonexistant American 
Dream.  So he's the "best dj" in the world?  Whooptie doo, Howard 
stern is the best radio personality, but I hear his shit for free 
EVERY FUCKING DAY.  He's not a sell out, He does what he wants to 
do under the budget constraints he has.  Yes, the guy makes 
Millions of dollars per year, but there has never been a question 
of character posed on him.  The question looms that does oakenfold 
really do it for the money, or for the love?  He's doing it for 
the money IMHO.  And that is why HE is a sell out.  If he actually 
did anything innovative, i'd give him some credit... the closest 
thing he's done that i give him even a slight bit of respect for 
was 'starry eyed surprise' because it was a little bit of a new 
sound, and if you didn't notice, it wasnt P-TRANCE.  So here we 
go... non-innovative sound in production, non-innovative style of 
dj'ing, cashing in on great marketing and LCD music.  Sell 
Out.  "No talent ass clown"

>The deep lush strings of Wide Angle were recorded in Russia courtesy

>both subtle and timeless. "We like making music that will last," explains 
>Healings. "Music that isn't disposable. We want people to listen to it over 
>and over again in the future." "Music you can play before you go out and 
>listen to when you chillout," continues Truman.

>Hybrid opened this decade with 'Kid 2000' featuring the sensuous vocals of 
>The Pretenders Chrissie Hynde. "When you hear very formulated European

>from. There's nothing in it to make you happy or melancholic. We aim to 
>instil a strong emotional content into our music."
>
>The outstanding reviews and success of their debut went cosmic:Hybrid, 
>support act for MOBY in America, are collecting celebrity admirers. GILLIAN 
>ANDERSON of the X Files and rocker TOMMY LEE hung around their dressing 
>room like starstruck teenagers. The Sun October 2000. The Moby US tour 
>(2000) lasted nine weeks with 48 performances.
>
>Here in 2003, their second LP, Morning Sci-Fi, is the next ingenious step 
>forward. The task of crafting new influences around their ever-mutating 
>breakbeats has been a lengthy progression. "We've been listening to 
>absolutely anything other than dance music, explains Healings. I 
>suppose that is because dance music is so ingrained into what we do 
>naturally. We've been listening to stuff like The Doves, Aqualung, 
>Radiohead, Soulwax, lots of jangly indie guitar bands and classical music, 
>particularly the work of Arvo Part and Alexander Gretchaninov."
>
>The live guitars and some of the bass sections were courtesy of Adam 
>Taylor, Richard Thair (Redsnapper) supplied the drums for 'Marrakech' and 
>'Think I'm Still Awake'; John Creamer opens the album with a spoken word 
>intro exploring the nature of his dreams. All the strings were recorded 
>last December in St Petersburg courtesy of the world-class Hermitage 
>Orchestra.
>
>Yet one of the albums strangest collaborations came about after Hybrid's

>ranted about the merit of a good bass line in a dance track. "Non of these 
>bloody dance remixers ever use my bass lines," argued Hook. "I put in all 
>this time and effort and they use Bernards vocals but they don't bloody 
>use my bass."
>
>The following week Hybrid sent over a couple of tracks and Hook rang back 
>and agreed to play his "bloody bass" on 'True To Form' and 'High As A 
>Skyscraper'. Thus the album was complete. Now Hybrid's resounding second LP

>Hybrid has also remixed over 40 artists including Radiohead, Alanis

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Define Sell-out, PLEASE

saw the subject
wanted to comment

i just saw 24 hour party people
good movie BTW. and they talk
about this a bit.
being a sell-out is taking everything
you have worked so hard for, and
selling it to someone else.
oakenfold is not a sellout, he is a
performer, and a damn good one
at that, he is not an artist, he doesn't
really own anything, so he has nothing
to sell-out.

Abbasso.  She came over and hung out after her set at
touch, and played an hour or so's worth of tracks
after maetrik and brian were through for the ten
people or so that were left.  Again...wonderful night.

Subject: {pb-cle} Sellout for lunch box


Well, your logic is great and all but I feel it is biased towards 
keeping Oakenfold as not a sell-out in your mind :)  Seriously though, 
here is a shot at it for you, I'll try to explain:

As far as defining sell out goes though, I think, really, any definition 
is going to include the perspective of outsiders as being the important 
vantage point rather than the individual or band, act, etc.  Because any 
individual or band most likely does see themselves as selling out (your 
logic is based a little around this point), which, in my opinion, is why 
it hurts their "fans" so much when selling out occurs.

To me, selling out is when someone or a group forgoes written or 
unwritten ideals and principles to make a buck, or while making a buck, 
or becoming famous/an icon etc.  The motivating factor doesn't 
necessarily have to involve fame or fortune or social status, but as 
they say, sometimes the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

 From what I understand, Oakenfold has dumbed down his act and in order 
to gain mass appeal, and "spread electronic music," but to those on here 
who deem him a sell-out, he has merely spread bland, uninteresting, 
superficial, common denominator music to people who expect it to sound 
as it does.

When he comes to town, very few people will have left the show thinking 
"wow, I had no idea this music could have depth and soul" as opposed to 
getting what they expect - stereotypical, hands in the air trance.  And 
while there is nothing wrong with him playing what he wants to play, 
some feel he shirks his duty, being what the public sees as an icon for 
electronic music - showing that it is more than what it appears on the 
surface.

With great power comes great responsibility.  Few want to take the 
responsibility, music wise.  But they all want the 10 grand a gig, 
limos, expensive dinners and mobs of fans.

2 cents -
Adam

TRANCE IN MISSISSIPPI 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
At the Barrio Antiguo GRILL! 
the south pulls it together for a night! 
lots of fabric hung up and spandex installed, full UV environment in 3 hours 
flat. 
some mexican boxing on the big screen tv! 
mackie actives were crisp and absolute. 
QOG - his first dj set - ! recently got his ass kicked out the nest... time 
to fly, BOY! sliced in with some deep crunchy dark minimal swirlys. good 
start . 
some people came. 
mexican family feud, viernes y miercoles! 
Dragon played, GLOWINGLY. got on there like he was invisible and threw down 
for the hometown starbase linkup. 
goa-neckwas sporting the antennae helmet receiving wild broadcasts! 
Freedom blew it the fuckup. arkansas!? where is that , whoo-a? wacky goa 
styley vinyl launch - RAMP 

not to mention a girl from south africa, she was loving IT! best party she 
had ever been to int he USA-- you know thats right... 
more mexicans came, more mexicans watching TV. (and watching the trance 
party) 
those mexicans saw a mfckin blue monkey run up thru the club , ! i cleared 
the dancefloor quick! whew! talk about startin fresh, well, they had fun , i 
played timecode, afro-galactic and the like... slamm. 
KRI came on with a deep and dark groove rocket and we danced our way further 
and further into the time vortex, mississippi didnt know what hit em.. 
dancefloor got stomped. got pretty thick there for a while with much evil 
eye comin from the mexican contingent. los vasqueros! 
so then we started to chop down our Uv masteriece and had it all in the car 
in less than 30 mins , 
what the hell just happened? 
we almost had to hug the thundermug on this one folks, keep it tuned to this 
bat channel for more reports from the frontier of freaky social 
experimentations! bloooo- HA 
bom to your mom

<<don't even mention RAPs Twix commercial

Um, I don't think this qualifies.

1) 80 to 90% of the people who saw that twix commercial have 0% clue who she is or what she does.
2) Someone may see her cd in a store and go "hey, that's the hot chick from the twix commercial" and
pick it up. She really didn't gain a fan by promoting her music that way, but she didn't pander to
an audience by "dumbing down" her music either.
3) She didn't really sell out her music in any way. She appeared in a commercial, with someone
else's shitty commercial music. It had less to do with her music that with the fact that she's a
beautiful woman who has some level of recognition in a given target market demographic.

Eh, now that I read that...maybe. I dunno. Anyone else wanna help me out with this one?

Subject: Re:  {pb-cle} Sellout for lunch box 


DJ Rap has certainly attempted to sell out her music.  Considering she
hasn't engineered her own tunes to begin with it's not much of a surprise.
But really she was considered trying to sell out in 99 when she came out
with the !Horrific! album "Learning Curve" --

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00000J7SA/ref=m_art_li_1/002-6061529-8591201?v=glance&s=music

Check it out.  Since then she has attempted to revive her Proper Talent
label and gain her credibility back by making tunes with Danny C,
etc, etc.. but there is no excuse for Learning Curve in my opinion, that
shit was horrible and shameful.

The saddest thing is when someone tries to sell out and doesn't make it as
huge as they hoped.  For example, Rap with learning curve in 99.  You then
find them a few years later moving to LA, appearing in Twix commercials,
having 500 ravers on her friendster, etc...

Don't get me wrong, back in 94ish Rap was a great DJ.. but I'm just not
feeling what she's up to now.  Kudos on getting Proper Talent back off the
ground (haven't seen any recent releases tho other than last year) and
touring again, but I can't forgive her for that LP.

I think it was like a 409 grease cleaner commercial, there's like this
chick who spins house on one stain on the oven and like some kinda
really awful crap on the other. 

She totally sold out man.

Preach on Brotha Luke.

Sellout is a term that ladder climbing no-talent wannabes use freely to =
let us know who they are jealous of.
Real underground doesn't go around labeling people.

Maybe I have no talent and I'm a wannabe .. but I'm certainly not trying
to climb any ladders, and I'm certainly not jealous of Oakenfold.  And I
think this applies to many of the people in this discussion too.  I don't
understand how using the term "sellout" immediately means we are all
jealous ambitious greedy wannabe's with no talent?

So in your opinion if anyone ever says anything is a sellout, then they
are a no talent wannabe?  When Neil Young refused to play woodstock 2 and
he used the term sellout, does that mean that he has no talent, he's
jealous, and he's a wannabe?

I think people are allowed to, and can and do have different perspectives
on this matter - and there is intelligence behind them.  I really resent
labeling anyone who chooses to express the opinion that someone has sold
out in the way that you have -- and you have used labeling ("ladder
climbing, no talent wannabes") to do it.  That is like the Administration
saying that anyone who questions the Government or the President is
unpatriotic.  Is that how you want to be?

I am jealous. I can't think of to many things I wouldn't do for a 100
grand especially if it only meant a couple hours of work.

Umm oakenfold isn't trying to reshape the globe.... He just playing a
gig. Don't go. Or better yet go and spread the word. Hand out flyers,
cd's, educate. It would take far less energy then ripping on somebody
who has no chance of defending himself :)

A dj's job is to entertain and to educate when they can. He is not up
there saying look at me I am mister god producer. He's just spinning
choones that most people get into. The problem isn't him its your pissed
that his crap can draw a crowd while our scene seems to be turning into
dust.

I am 100% in agreement with Doug. 

When did dj'ing became a philosophy and/or a religion. Last time I
checked it was about entertaining. I think people have way distorted
views of what a dj is and does. Hence 100 grand gigs, what a scam.

But why does this sell? ...and for so much money?

I have heard about Oakenfold pre-recording cd's and just playing the CD out 
at a show and jumping around behind the decks as if he were playing. That is 
beyond molesting children.

...but his shows still sell out? You would think by now the jig would be up?

I have a cd of a few big parties over in the UK and a couple of them you
can see this black boxes about the size of a cd palyer component for a
stereo and their record bags are conveniently placed right next to these. 
If this is how the big wigs spin, then I can be a supastar :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Sellout for lunch box


Why do the backstreet boys and 'nsync sell and pack stadiums?  why do
britney shows sell out, while she lipsyncs to a robotic voice and dances?

if people want to follow the argument that, because it has mass appeal and
makes tons of $$, it must be good, then all the inherent flaws in that
logic apply.

There is more under the surface.. I would think of all places this list
would understand that, no?  That is why you are here right?

There's many layers to the onion.. if you just want to peel back the first
one and be happy with DJ Rap and Oakenfold's latest offerings, then so be
it.  If you don't want to dig deep, then fine.. that is your right.  But
there are many who would think you are missing out.

It is my opinion and that of many others that those who are in a position
to teach and educate through example, many of them pioneers, that it is
their DUTY to do so.  There is something to be said about acts that have
mass appeal yet are still engaging and challenging.  I don't feel that
Oakenfold is one of them.

I understand that people are going to think that life is about making $$,
and they are always going to think that.  So the more money someone makes,
the more worth they have, in that view.  I and several others on this list
don't subscribe to that.  I think that is the issue that is being
discussed here.

In life you only have so much time to spend exploring.. culture, food,
music, people, literature, film, etc.  If all you want is the surface and
what's just below, then that is fine.  If that is what you need to make
yourself happy and feel like you are not a sheep, good.  But it will
always be hard to argue that that is what is the best and that is what is
great, to those who make it a mission to keep exploring, and keep digging,
under those initial layers.

that line of argument is definitely a weak thing.

personally, im just a wanna be with no talent. im not jealous or

how about fugazi who have maintained nearly 20 years of not

i mean, i know i have made a pretty simple distinction between 
people who get paid much loot because theyre great artists (may, 
mills, etc) and people who get paid much loot because theyre 
suckering in drugged up idiots (oakenfold). this is pretty much 
the entire argument: being paid for making good art isnt a bad 
thing. being paid to spin LCD bullshit is a very bad thing.

your scene might be turning to dust. my scene is chock full of ill 
motherfuckers. its almost funny that you think your "scene" is 
turning to dust, yet you dont blame any of it on weak deejays like 
oaky. who do you pass the blame to?

jukeboxes are about entertainment. and hey, if you can separate 
art and philosophy, you must be on some next level shit. because 
for most people i know, they are inseparable. 

>I think people have way distorted
>views of what a dj is and does. Hence 100 grand gigs, what a scam.

do you think salvador dali's art isnt worth what it costs? do you 
think sheppard fairey is just some guy who puts up posters? man, 
your life must be horribly fucking boring with your attitude 
towards art and its meaning in life.

the same reason eminem sells. a watered down whitened form of

thats not really a precise definition at all. actually, thats as 
far from it as possible. selling your art doesnt make you a sell 
out. 

>oakenfold is not a sellout, he is a

at one point he obviously did aspire to be something great. 
working with the happy mondays (while theyre not really my kind of 
thing) at least meant something artistically. he does nothing 
artistic now. so how can he be a good performer? you cannot be a 
good performer if your performance has no substance.

There you have it.. you will always have two sides to this argument:

1. it's about entertaining and making money by way of mass appeal.. so you
play whatever gets the crowd pumping, who cares if you even like it
yourself?  Play what is familiar, what people know, anthems.

2. it's about entertaining, by way of challenging and stimulating, pushing
boundaries, creating a path on the edge - through music.

Paul I could give a shit that Oakenfold's stuff can draw a crowd while
"our scene seems to be turning into dust" -- his stuff always will draw a
crowd. That is not the point.

The point is that by embracing the mentality that it's only about
entertainment first, and music second, third or fourth etc, the scene will
get stale.  Because no one will want to be pushed or challenged. and when
not pushed or challenged, it gets boring.

I agreed with what you said.. maybe that didn't go out to the list.  =
Expecially the last line of your first post on the topic (which I do not =
have in front of me right now).

My point is that real underground people don't need to use the term =
sellout.  If you do then your a poseur.

Hang on a second.  =20

I do *NOT* think #1 is true and that is NOT my side of the arugement.

For me it is about furthering what I like to play AND sucking the crowd =
into it so that I am able to play what I want to play.  Someone who is =
into things more abstract than I might be into what I am playing.  =
Someone who is into things more commercial than I might not be into what =
I am playing.  People with an open mind don't care.  Underground is open =
mindedness.

Superstar djs are just that... superstars.  They are rock idols, pop =
stars, and whatnot.  While there are exceptions, most are are not fresh, =
underground, or cutting edge.  They are not part of the underground.

With those basic understandings, anyone who is not himself a superstar =
and feels the need to use the label "sellout" can see my first post on =
the subject. =20

You bring up the point about Neil Young and Woodstock 2.  It shows =
INTEGRITY not to play because he believed it to be selling out.  Its =
argueable if it was selling out or not though.  In regards to djs, well, =
if you can afford to turn down gigs then that is great.  Also... Neil =
Young UNDENIABLY has a right to judge a sellout.  As local djs do we =
have that same right?

Ratana, do you believe that dj's have to play original material to be =
credible?  That's another arguement I think is stupid.   In the =
evolution of this whole dj thing -- 90% of the relevant djs have played =
other people's music.  Back in the day artists played live and djs =
played other people's music.  Now it isn't practicle to play live =
because most composing is simply done with a program like rebirth, acid, =
or whatnot. So in order to tour, the artists had to take up djing.

Fuck all this stuipd bullshit - and it IS bullshit that we (as people =
with a non-mainstream mindset) are discussing "sellouts".  It's all just =
disco.

  There you have it.. you will always have two sides to this argument:

  1. it's about entertaining and making money by way of mass appeal.. so =
you
  play whatever gets the crowd pumping, who cares if you even like it
  yourself?  Play what is familiar, what people know, anthems.

  2. it's about entertaining, by way of challenging and stimulating, =
pushing
  boundaries, creating a path on the edge - through music.

  Paul I could give a shit that Oakenfold's stuff can draw a crowd while
  "our scene seems to be turning into dust" -- his stuff always will =
draw a
  crowd. That is not the point.

  The point is that by embracing the mentality that it's only about
  entertainment first, and music second, third or fourth etc, the scene =
will
  get stale.  Because no one will want to be pushed or challenged. and =
when
  not pushed or challenged, it gets boring.

why does everyone still have these long ass discussions about 
oakenfold, and pop music in general?

we need the 5 year cycle of pop imitating underground in order for 
the underground to keep on moving. money, sell outs,die hards 
etc... whatever. sometimes, i think people make something as 
beautiful as music so damned cerebral & political that we lose the 
meaning and purpose of the music to begin with.


now...

go buy some records.

Subject: {pb-cle} the sellout of all sellouts

Ratana argued both sides of the coin:

<<so you play whatever gets the crowd pumping, who cares if you even like it yourself?  Play what is
familiar, what people know, anthems.>>

versus

<<by way of challenging and stimulating, pushing boundaries, creating a path on the edge - through
music.>>

I will give you a perfect first-person example:

I DJ every Saturday night at a bar in the South Side. Pop, rap, top 40, oldies, hair metal
singalongs, house (daft punk, groove armada, etc), some of the more popular crossover trance stuff,
even some drum n bass. Played for people in the bar to party and have a good time and sing along and
keep feeding the till at the bar.

I also, very cleverly (at least, I think so), like to drop in a track from some artist that they've
never heard before. I've dropped a John Tejada remix in a block of house music. I'll toss in a
melodic jungle track when I'm mixing out of a set of rap. It's not a lot, but every now and then,
someone stops and says "Hey, what is that? That's fucking hot, man. Keep playing that stuff."

Do I think there's a modicum of talent involved in what I do? Sure. If you play music that no one
wants to hear, people won't come to the bar. If there's 10 seconds of silence between every song,
people will know you're a shit DJ. If you can't announce the drink specials and talk fast over the
intro of the song, you sound like an idiot.

I have fun doing it, and I love to see people having a good time thanks in part to me playing music.
AND...every now and then, if I can turn just ONE person on to something new and cool that they
haven't heard before, then I've succeeded as an entertainer AND as someone who is true to art in
challenging and opening up people's awareness of good music and good art.

That's where Oakenfold fails, and why he's a sellout. He's there to please the crowd, to give them
exactly what they expect, to not challenge their thinking about what this music is that he's
playing. He isn't trying anything new or challenging or interesting. It's the same tracks from 1998
over and over again. You can dance to it, but you might as well be listening to top 40 radio.

Yeah, Oakenfold? He's like the Aerosmith of electronic dance music.

Now, when I come out (rare as it is anymore) to play at a venue around the city that caters to
electronic dance music, you won't hear me play Nelly or Guns n Roses or any of that music (unless
it's with tongue planted firmly in cheek). In fact, I take delight in the proposition that I don't
have to take requests and am completely left to my own devices to excite a crowd of 5 or 50 or 500
with MY choices for their entertainment, and I'll either do a good job and keep the floor moving, or
I'll stink and empty the place out.

I spend time looking for rarities, tracks that aren't the "obvious" choice, and yet maintain the
ethos of what I'm trying to do with a set of music....be it a laid back, lounge-y set, a set of
pumping house, or whatever.

And furthermore, I've got my own things to say with music, and I've begun producing my own tracks to
play live....to bring something more to what I view as the true "art" part of deejaying...I've
processed so much music through my head over the years, I've got ideas of what I'd like to add to
music as an art form.

I'm pushing myself right now...I'm exploring the world of soulful house and broken beat (which,
unfortunately, seems to be becoming the "genre du jour" for the trend followers and I risk being
lumped in that category). I'm trying to do something new and original within the loose confines of
what those genres represent, and perhaps take them somewhere new and exciting and original. And I
hope, by doing that, that I push the audience, and challenge them to the point where they say, "Hey,
I've never heard THAT before...that's pretty cool. I think I'd like to shake my ass to that over
here on this dance floor with this fine lookin' honey over here."

(I would also hope they say "Damn, that white boy has some soul." But I'm still realistic...I
recognize that no matter what, I'm still a white kid from suburbia who grew up listening to soul and
jazz and rap, and I'm not going to try and be something I'm not. But I digress....)

These moments are where deejaying becomes an art...when you attempt to open the listener's ears to
something they haven't heard before. Something they didn't know they liked, perhaps....The point is,
I'm still trying. Trying to challenge myself. Trying to challenge people out there who listen.

What the hell does that have to do with this show. Everyone is bitching
that he is bad for the scene... Well there is going to be an ocean of
people there that you can influence or try to sway from the dark side ;)

I don't pass blame anywhere. I think the scene is evolving. Merging with
the club scene.
I think oakenfold sucks ass. I have never paid to see him. Nor will I
ever. But it is not his fault the scene err I am sorry my scene is
fucked up. That place is going to be jumping. Shitty music or not the
vibe is going to be there. I have not had a good exp in Cleveland
Pittsburg in over 4 years with the exception of diesel boy at metro...
<shivers> that's was just fucking bad ass... Not that cool shit isn't
going on. But the crowds are smaller.

They are small because of this almost elitist attitude. Why not let some
assholes make some money getting edm to appeal to wider market. Why not
get more people intrigued. Anyone I know how gets into electronic a of
any kind started with some dripping wet trance or from hip hop to dnb.
Then it evolved. I miss huge scale events where 5 thousand people where
jumpin around screaming. 

My comment was against anyone in the scene. It was just a fact that
every year the scene is "smaller". 
Maybe we just look for different things when we go out to dance. I am
looking to have a good time. Meet "NEW" people and listen to some cool
shit. I am not out there to get enlightened or to pay homage to cult of
the bass kick.

No Comment my logic on this escapes you to argue it is only going to

OK, I said I wasn't going to get in on this thread, but I'll throw my .02 in.

The whole reason I ever got into this "scene" was because I enjoyed the
music.  I have a cd of MP3s from the late 90's (long time ago for me) that
has a ton of electronic music on it.  I listened to it not know what I was
listening to, but I liked it.  I became a big fan of music from Dune,
again, having no idea what it was called besides "electronic."  I didn't
know a thing abot raves till Lenny (whom I met by starting to go to lan
parties) mentioned some new thing he was doing, not even sure if he
mentioned why type of music it was.  Well I went and it's all
downhill/uphill (however you look at it) from there.

That was in late '99.  I remember when I first of this "hyperreal" list
that people talked about, I was getting 200 messages a day, on a slow day.
 I also slowly started to find out that there is more to electronic music
then just electronic.  I had no idea there was house, trance, etc, which
now seems so obvious to me.

I'm still listening to new stuff and different styles that I'm not use to.
 I probably have at least one CD from just about any genre you can think
of, and I listen to all of them depending on my mood.  I am one of the
people that in this "scene" for the music.  Not drugs, not to see some
supastar dj, not to get drunk, not to rape some chick (like I've seen
portrayed on more then one tv show).  I started to collect records and
been practicing, not to make 100,000 a gig, but because I like the music,
so much that I'm willing to spend the 1500 or whatever I've spent so far
on equipment, records, and time, knowing full well that I will probably
never make that money back.  And I'm STILL buying records occasionally.

I kinda got off track there, but the main thing I wanted to say was I put
music above entertainment.  I don't care if everyone thinks this person is
cool, if I don't like their music, I'm not going to pay $50 to go see
them.

the point is that the money behind people like oakenfold is
crushing to the money behind even the most well funded
alternatives. as much as this has to do with a specific style of
music, it has to do with corporate culture in this country in
general. 

>I don't pass blame anywhere. I think the scene is evolving.
Merging with
>the club scene.

this has nothing to do with anything. techno and house music came
from clubs themselves. raves co-opted those genres, and pumped out
some brilliant music (old school hardcore/jungle, uk garage, etc)
but mostly it pumped out some bullshit (trance, prog house, etc).
now whats happening is the money is behind the easiest to digest
product, and that product is sadly influencing the vasy majority
of peoples opinions on dance music before they even hear the real
shit. rock doesnt have to deal with this, people are mostly aware
that there are different styles of rock music. with electronic
music, people complain that "it all sounds the same" because the
only shit they ever hear DOES all sound the same. and the people
playing those records are people like oakenfold.

i hear the vibe at klan rallies is pretty banging. lots of like

simply having a good time consuming it doesnt give art meaning.

that really goes to show what kind of events youve chosen to
attend. ive seen enough good things in pgh and cleveland
especially over the last couple years, and i havent even been able
to attend every single event ive wanted to. at the level of
artforms, the things going on right now are possibly as good as
theyve been since the dawn of jungle music. that was about 10
years ago.

so do all the people who show up to see "spiderman" the movie
eventually end up loving independant cinema? do all the people who
read stephen king novels end up loving hemmingway? nah. id
actually say that the crossover is nearly none, simply because of
the vast difference in quality of art vs entertainment. 

>Then it evolved. I miss huge scale events where 5 thousand people

really? you should go to the DEMF next year. youll see way more
people than that, going totally bonkers, to great music.

perhaps you should just go to top 40 clubs. from what i hear
people dance there, and you can meet people. i like the people ive
met through this music on a social level, but i still just wont go
out unless i think the music being played is of some high level of
artistic quality. 

>No Comment my logic on this escapes you to argue it is only going to

good call : ) 

>Your comparing a dj to dali? Ya....

absolutely! there are deejays who can abstract plenty of emotions
from records that seemingly werent there. every type of art in
every genre of art that you can think of can be done through
creating and/or deejaying music. and obviously theres more to
music than just what other mediums and genres offer, it has its
own thing going on. but if you dont think that a great deejay is
as good or better than any great artist can be, youre listening to
the wrong deejays.

i wouldnt say that they MUST play their own material, but it
certainly lends itself to more directly being able to express
yourself as an artist. there are definitely deejays who can play
nothing but other peoples' tunes and still have art to it, but i
think it helps if you can play your own music in addition.

disco had plenty of crap music made strictly to sell records
(mainly to white people). lots of people "went disco" and made
horrible records trying to cash in.

You do not have a right to speak on this subject when you (directly or
indirectly) support the people who steal from the alternative via
filesharing, burning, etc.    While I have always failed to describe the
greater effects of piracy in text, I fully believe it has hurt the
underground far more than it ever hurt the mainstream.  Believe it or not,
profits from mainstream artists often go to bring up lesser known talent.

i get the feeling that if everyone in the usa started
liking what the "non sellout" people liked, the "non
sellout" people, or snobs, wouldnt like it anymore.
simply cause everyone else liked it. most music (imo)
that is underground right now blows. it sounds like it
isnt even music anymore. like there is no soul. just a
bunch of weird sounds. hahaha... i sound so
mainstream! wait a minute, i am, according to the
"underground".

well, at least a lot of the dnb is getting a little
more musical these days. it really went thru the
grinder for a while. techno... i havent heard any
around here that i could dance to. maybe some shit
juwan was playing somewhere but, for the most part it
just doesnt have soul. you know, even the shit that
has soul sucks. like two step. damn, im starting to
sound just like the snobs.

ok i understand where all of you snobs are coming
from. the difference is that i like music cause its
good and you all like music cause its cool. ive been
trying phrase that for like three years now.

peace,
clevr

disco had a VERY underground side as well.  back then all dance music (even
the underground stuff and even kraftwork [funky disco] to the djs spinning
then) was called disco.

saying "its all just disco" has far more meaning than saying "its all just
techno".

i work at 2 record shoppes, and i spend my money in plenty of
others. i have more of a right to talk about the money at work in
music than most people do.

anyway, how could my giving columbia some money for a rock cd help
out my favorite detroit house artists? its not gonna. but this is
a whole other argument.

so obviously we see eye to eye about that. (nice name dropping me
on there, you shoulda emailed me when the thread was going on, id
have jumped in). anyway, this is exaclty my criticism of oaky:
watered down crap that gets to be representative of sounds that
are nothing like it because of some perceived "greatness" of his
non-art.

im not sure that is true. really, the idea of people being as
excited about music for the pure reasons as i am on a big scale
excites me. the success of the DEMF makes me want to cry. music
that is so underground resonating with a huge group of people,
some of whom flew to detroit from around the world,  while having
almost no advertising is just mind blowing. its a testament to the
quality of the artform at its best.

this is obviously true. some music is "underground" for a reason.

ill have to go ahead and disagree with you here. there is plenty
of techno that is good. if youre looking for it in pgh, youre
looking in the wrong place. no offense meant (well, no more than
usual: ), but the stuff colin and john brommage and those cats
play is not representative of the quality of techno. the technoir
audio cats hold it down, but their gigs are much less frequent
than they deserve to be. if they were out there as frequently,
youd hear alot more good stuff. 

>you know, even the shit that
>has soul sucks. like two step. damn, im starting to
>sound just like the snobs.

ha. 2-step has been effectively dead for about 1.5 years now.
things in that genre have reverted to either 95 era UK garage (pre
speed garage, the dream teem are rocking this kinda stuff now) or
semi-hiphop like dizzee rascal.

youre preaching to the choir here man. i know this.

i work at 2 record shoppes, and i spend my money in plenty of
others. i have more of a right to talk about the money at work in
music than most people do.
---------------------------



That was just an in to the filesharing topic.  There are a lot of things
hurting the industry and it isn't Oakenfold's wealth that is crushing the
little guy.  Rockstar has to charge more when he tours to make up the money
he used to make from cd sales.  The label doesn't have as much money to
invest in lesser known acts.  That's only one example.

Record stores can no longer afford to take a chance on an unknown artist
whereas you when there was more profit there was more variety in the stores.
Talented buyers and smart buying of course can compensate for that, but in
the grander scheme of things retailers cannot stock tracks by the little guy
that isn't going to turn an immediate profit.  Of course many will argue
that digital technology is the answer to that problem.   So the cycle
continues.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ok let's get a few things straight...

 "but the stuff colin and john brommage and those cats
play is not representative of the quality of techno"


ok...so what if this is the stuff that makes us wanna
dance, and the people who come to our night to hear
it, and the stuff jwan plays DOESNT make us wanna
dance? should we stop playing it and liking it because
you disagree? i'm sure you'd have even less respect
for us if we did, or at least i hope so. so what if we
like this kind of techno? who are you to say that it
sucks absolutely just because yuo don't care for it?
since when are you the ultimate authority of taste? i
LIKE hard, minimal, and yes, above all, REPETITIVE
music. the repetition is part of the reason i got into
techno in the first place. it's dance music after all,
and what is dancing if not repetitive motion? and
besides all that, i play repetitive minimal and often
boring music for one reason above all others: a real
dj with skill can make this music less boring, instead
of taking the easy way out of lame dj's with no skills
who rely on their music. if my crowd moves, it's
because of me, more than because of my music. you guys
are nothing without your music. you're not musicians,
you're just dj's. even jwan has said, "you could train
a chimp to mix records." i like the music that jwan
and arnie and shawn and even you (tom) play/make. but
it is more listening/chilling music than dance music
to me. and either way it's not the only dance music. i
like more energetic music. so crucify me. i don't like
songy music with a bunch of different parts. OH MY GOD
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID??? you better shoot me -
wait, i'll do ya one better -- I ACTUALLY DON'T REALLY
CARE FOR SOULFULL MUSIC ALL THE TIME. oh jesus, i can
hear the mob gathering outside already. since when is
soul the be-all-end-all of music? i like hard pounding
machine music, i like funky music, i like fucking, not
making love. i don't make love. so i don't wanna hear
people whining about it. 

i'm not trying to start a big 3-day debate either, i
don't care enough to argue the point, but for the
people reading and hearing me and john being written
off as some kind of losers or something by someone who
simply doesnt understand/care for what we do, this is
my rebuttal. you're all welcome to your opinions, and
i don't really worry about wether or not the tom cox's
of the world, or anyone else for that matter likes
what i do or not, since i do it primarily for me. 

dig it. i say "to each their fucking own." let's all
stop stepping all over each other for a god-damned
change.

simple phrase has gotten me through many discussions...here it is:

"There is a BIG difference between 'I like it' and 'it is Good'"

I like: Lucha Libre & Misty Mundae Movies.
but we know this is just fluff, general nonsense and guilty 
pleasure.

Kraftwerk is GOOD. Kenny Dixon Jr. is Good.  Ennio Morricone is 
GOOD. Les Baxter is Good. Roy Ayers is Good. Tito Puente is Good.

thats cool you like what you like, no one can ever take that away
(just like i love bad cinema!!,no one is taking that away damnit!)

you conveniently left out the "no offense meant" part of my
statement : ) 

anyway, my point was that most hard techno (especially recently)
is less about art and more about simple dance music. if thats a
bad thing to you (which it is to me, i like my music to be art),
then its going to be less satisfying as an artform. dont get me
wrong, theres hard techno artists i enjoy: jeff mills, robert
hood, older surgeon, etc, but for the most part the genre seems to
have cooled off considerably since 98 when many producers were
putting out fabulous material. 

like i said, if youre just wanting to dance, hard techno is fine
for that. on the art level, its not holding up. even jeff mills'
recent concept pieces have all been more melodic based. 

>since when are you the ultimate authority of taste?

didnt you get that memo? 

; P 

>i
>LIKE hard, minimal, and yes, above all, REPETITIVE
>music. 

so do i. old chicago shit murders me, as does the older hard
techno sound. dan bell and rob hood are two of the biggest
influences on me musically. theres most definitely room to combine
art with that banging beat, its just not done much anymore. 

>the repetition is part of the reason i got into
>techno in the first place. it's dance music after all,
>and what is dancing if not repetitive motion?

ive got no problem with that, i play plenty of minimal music. theo
parrish is my hero, and he makes tracks as long as 15 minutes with
little to no change throughout them. ditto with basic channel. 

>and
>besides all that, i play repetitive minimal and often

ha. this is a whole other discussion. but if its the easy way out,
why are 99% of deejays' sets boring as hell? 

>if my crowd moves, it's
>because of me, more than because of my music. you guys
>are nothing without your music. you're not musicians,
>you're just dj's. 

this is true, thats what making tunes is for, IMO.

this also has to do with the crowd youre playing for. i know your
stereo type for the kind of music we tend to play, but alot of the
reaction has to do with poorly educated crowds. other places,
people really do tend to go quite mad for it, believe me.

its not that i dont understand or care. its that i was into that
kind of thing 5 years ago, and the stuff coming out today doesnt
stand up in quality to those older tunes or the newer tunes by
better artists.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ok let's get a few things straight...

"you conveniently left out the "no offense meant" part
of my
statement : ) "

i got it, i just thought that the people reading it
should be able to hear my side of the point. really
it's something that i've wanted to say for a while,
but haven't  been able to exactly articulate. i think
that kind of techno has a place, and that's at least
partly why it's being made, bought, and played.

i'm just not interested as much in playing music
that's art as in making non-art music art through
mixing. to me the mixing is the art. i like the
"mixing tool" idea, always have. i do think music
should be art, but there's more than one kind of art.
depends on how you defin art i guess. i mean dance
music has an inherent functionality issue. for me the
art music is more for listening to at home, in an
environment more suitable for real listening. but at a
party or a club, whatever, i just wanna make people
jump, or yell and scream and pump fists, cuz that's
what gets me amped. it's just 2 different schools.
when i go to buy records i buy stuff that i know is
going to work if it's for a gig, and the stuff that's
really interesting for myself. 

i think it's all good either way. i love the music,
that's a given, but i love mixing it even more. so i
play stuff that leaves me more room to create. i'm not
really trying to educate anyone, because i don't think
i'm someone who's so high and lofty that i'm going to
educate people, (and sometimes people don't really go
to a club to be educated, and least of all a party) to
me there's something arrogant in even presuming that,
i just wanna make people have fun, cuz that's how i
have fun. and i can do it while still playing stuff
that i like, stuff that moves me. 

besides all that, some of the music that i play does
have alot more going on in it, but it's just more
subtle, i guess rhythm is enough for me, i could take
or leave melody. really, rhythm is melody anyway,
they're two sides of the same coin, symmetrical.
there's a time and a place for all of it i think. i'm
a musician, i started out playing music, in bands and
all that. so that's my backgraound. and also my
background even since before that is hip-hop. so the
whole scratchy tricky style is second nature to me,
and i'd much rather see a guy play boring music and do
alot of cool shit with it, than the natural vice. i
know that's where we differ. whatever. it's all good i
say. i just don't think that this type of techno is
without merit, or that it sucks. i love the shit.
let's not forget that i play other kinds of techno
too, just not out very often, cuz i like the pounding
shit so much more right now, and also as you said,
people around here don't get into it much. it's just
more fun for me to play the simple, hard shit, so i
do. that's the bottom line. and if people like it and
come out for it and dance their asses off i don't see
what's so bad about it. there's definitely an artistic
quality to even this kind of techno, it's just not
what interests you.

laters.

Subject: {pb-cle} List your sell outs here...

I have never viewed any single individual or group as
a sell out.  It is not a bias towards or against any
person.  I believe we all have a choice to act as we
please, therefore, I belive that not a single
individual or group would or could be considered a
sell out.  It is a term that holds no water, and
semantics, in this case, are in the eye of the
beholder.  

So straight up, for those of you out...

IN YOUR OPINION,    WHO IS A SELL OUT???  

In list form, with out a reason.

Everyone is entitled to there own opinion and should
not be judged for who they view in this matter. 
Remember, it is only based in the eye of the opinion
maker.

Subject: {pb-cle} Sellout

It's just music, kids...

With that said, the guy at the hotel who takes your bags (and I'm making
assumptions here) doesn't like wearing that funny little outfit with the
funny little bowtie, and that stupid fucking hat. That's not his way of
expressing himself - that's his way of getting paid. He's a sell-out because
he's not getting paid doing what HE wants to do, but instead what YOU want
him to do (which is take your bags).

I do it for the money. I get up at 06:00 because I want to pay my bills. I'd
love to sit around all day and bitch about the rest of the world not being
as swift as I am, but I don't have that luxury. I'm a sell-out too.

So then, I guess what we're trying to get at is that in art, which is
supposed to be a creative, expressive medium (or way of life even), some
people have learned that they can make a fortune not at being creative and
expressive, but by repeatedly serving the seemingly insatiable human
appetite for familiarity and predictability. The result? Clich masquerading
as art, and lots of revenue being generated because of it.

Now, in the meantime there are creative and expressive people whose talents
and contributions go unnoticed. And to the true lover of art, this seems
unjust because the creative person puts hirself out there on the line saying
"here's what I'm about" and nobody seems to care, because they're
preoccupied with absorbing that which satisfies their own preconceived
notions about what illustration is or what dj-ing is or even what the
institution of "rave music" is...

In addition, those who see an entire gamut of electronic music having
breadth and depth will tend to be offended by the millions of dim-witted
sheep to only are willing to acknowledge (as Adam puts it) "hands in the air
trance" as the official soundtrack of a scintillating multi-faceted
meta-cultural phenomenon whose influences are so pervasive and are in so
many aspects of modern life that they're impossible to count. Recognize
muthafuckas. It's one thing to become mainstream but it's another thing when
the mainstream comes looking for you because it's tired of itself.

I guess the only sad thing is that in 50 years when people hear the word
"rave," they're going to imagine Oakie at the doped-out cyalume factory, and
if you tell people you're a raver, then that's what they're going to think
you're about too.

In closing, your neighbor's cat might think drill and bass sounds like
"video game music," but his hot 17-year-old daughter knows what's up, and
she digs your new Triple-Five hoodie, and if any of that makes sense to you,
then you're just as much of a heathen as Luke.

I did it all for the nookie.

J.[M]

{{ <luke@goaheadproductions.com> }
We all sellout in some form. This job I work is a huge sellout and totally
goes against my desire to sit on a porch all day with a 40 and some
psytrance pumpin in the backround. With a dog name microdot that carries
around a barrell of fire water around his neck and two blunts. }}

You're a god-damned heathen, and if that Saint Bernard ever gets wise I hope
he gnaws your dirty fucking balls off.

Subject: {pb-cle} on the subject of apartments -- looking [cleveland]

I am looking for a one bedroom, around $400/month close enough to
downtown clevo. I don't want a big apartment complex. I want a place
where I can paint the walls any color if I want ... and free parking.

I know there's an apartment for me out there somewhere. I just need to
find it.

i want to comment on mine: 

the first one that always pops into my mind is antiflag. if any of 
you saw their shows back in the day, or own any of their older 
material (pre-96), you know what im talking about. what idiots. 

as much as i love them, sonic youth's first geffin albums were 
without question an attempt to get radio airplay. the fact that 
the albums were still good and that the shit they did on the 
underground was crazy is why i dont hold it against them. 

metallica: they cut off their hair. enough said. 

any rock band who "went disco". even though chicago made "street 
player", almost all the rest of that shit was horrible. 

rancid: going from great underground band to mtv cocksuckers. ew. 

ll cool j: from great battle rapper to bitch tune rapper. weak. 

dr dre: from not smoking buddah with NWA to "the chronic" in one 
easy step. still a great record though, mostly because snoop wrote 
great lyrics. 

smashing pumpkins: one great major label album, then they devolved 
into silver wearing bald headed nonsense. 

korn: one great deeply emotional album, then crap "rap metal". 
icky.

the beastie boys: as much as i love the album and most of their 
material, they dropped their female drummer before "license to 
ill" because def jam thought it was a good idea. they helped make 
up for it later by signing her band luscious jackson to their 
label. still that shit was inexcusable.

really naming names like this is hard because so many bands alter 
themselves little by little as they go along. its much easier to 
list the opposite of sell outs, people who use their fame to push 
boundaries instead of trying to get more money: 

fugazi: always $10 cds from discord, no shows cost more than $5

radiohead: using their fame and glory to get fucking crazier on 
each album. 

justin timberlake: who knew someone from nsync would eventually 
produce one of the best pop albums of the last decade? he couldnt 
have done it if he was a nobody. 

NIN: all that money trent reznor made went into doing things like 
distroing warp LPs in the US, getting Coil some major label rmxes, 
etc.

nirvana: kurt cobain was a walking talking advertisement for his 
heroes and influences. what he accomplished for independant rock 
music while being on a major label is just silly. 

timbaland: making major bucks while pushing the art of hiphop by 
mixing it with experimental music and keeping it danceable. 

public enemy: chuck d used his popularity and money to be a 
champion of the people and of real hiphop, even if his recent 
music sucks. had he not sold all those albums, no one would have 
any fucking clue who he is and they wouldnt listen to him. 

the beatles: another group that used their popularity to push 
lunacy on the public. they could have made a career remaking "love 
love me do" or whatever. instead they revolutionized pop music 
recording. 

the klf: these guys define the idea of using pop culture to make 
great art. if you dont know, find out. theres too many great 
things that they did to list. 

tool: the more popular they get, the more their music degenerates 
into weird ambient songless nonsense. in a good way. 

im sure theres lots more ill think of as soon as i send this......

tom

tom cox is the biggest sellout, just today he said hes "the michael 
jordan of talking shit on weak motherfuckers".
michael jordan is about as big of a sell out as it gets.  so tom ranks 
up there, since he's such a great shit talker.
sell out mother fucker. he's a far bigger sell out than me.

I would define sell out as "one who does anything they can in order to
sell records and binds themselves to whatever gimmick the record label
deems neccessary to do so".  That would be a true "SELL OUT."

File sharing ad the ilk have done "everything" to expand the genre because
there are many who would not pay a second glance not knowing what to
expect w/o seeing what's to come.

This is true for so many types of music to inlucude punk, ska, rap, metal
and electronic music.  Free share is a god send.  It allows the lesser
knowns to be known.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} my sellout was:Sellout for lunch box

That's common hype that supporters of it use.  People always found out about
new artists and new music in the past and I don't dispute that filesharing
has replaced human socialization as a means of spreading word of music.
While some people legitimately get turned onto new music, filesharing
spreads GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) disinformation like wildfire.  In the
case of Electronic music and dj mixes the original artists loose their
identity because there is no credit to original artists.  It supports the
mentality of people who think "Can you play some Bad Boy Bill" is a
perfectly proper request at a nightclub.  In many cases a track gets burned
as the dj mix it is credited to and the artist isn't listed at all.   Before
filesharing, people with educated music tastes were the ones educating the
consumer.  You had to go out and socialize if you wanted to learn new music.
People who were really into EDM were forced to go out to get their fix of
new music - now you don't need to do that.  It's one less reason to go out
(and people who tell me otherwise really haven't put much thought into it).
One of the biggest arguments I see is that you no longer have to buy an
album to find out if you like an artist or not.  While this may be true you
can't deny that this takes money out of the industry and thusly it
encourages the industry to recoup its losses by developing even more
commercial formulamatic music that WILL turn a profit instead of allowing
any budget to develop forward moving music.

i want to comment on mine:

the first one that always pops into my mind is antiflag. if any of
you saw their shows back in the day, or own any of their older
material (pre-96), you know what im talking about. what idiots.

ANTI-FLAG..ARE YOU FOR REAL???? i AGREE...WHO ELSE TYPIFIES THE ABSURD
BURLESQUE OF MODERN YOUTH. ANTI FLAG SUCKS. THEY JUST REACH OUT TO ANY
ANTI-GEORGE BUSH THEME THEY CAN TO SELL LPS.  BLAHHHHHH.

as much as i love them, sonic youth's first geffin albums were
without question an attempt to get radio airplay. the fact that
the albums were still good and that the shit they did on the
underground was crazy is why i dont hold it against them.

DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST SONIC YOUTH.

metallica: they cut off their hair. enough said. BLAHHHHHH.



rancid: going from great underground band to mtv cocksuckers. ew.

RANCID AT LEAST HAD THE ABILITY TO TRANSCEND THE PUNK AIRWAVES...BIATCH.

kORN: CRAP METAL,...ENOUGH SAID

sORRY TOM EVERYTHING ELSE IS CRAP

Man..I can't wait to hear you and John
drop the sick shit at The Third Eye. 
I hear what you are sayin in this post 
too. It's really all a matter of preference.
I prefer more repetitive percussion oriented
tribal minimal techno to the funky dance stuff. 
But that's cuz I'm a heathen like Josh said.
But that certainly doesn't take away from 
what the Technoir crew does. Man..you all
are lucky to have such dope talent in
the burgh! Enjoy it.

Feel my drums,
Luke

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} List your sell outs here...

<<public enemy: chuck d used his popularity and money to be a champion of the people and of real
hiphop, even if his recent music sucks. had he not sold all those albums, no one would have any
fucking clue who he is and they wouldnt listen to him. >>

I think I disagree with this. While he hasn't given up his political views and preachings entirely,
he's still clearly about a rent check on more than one occasion....guesting on the weakest of weak
songs by Prince and most recently, Junkie XL. (While the JXL tune isn't bad, it's clear that Chuck
showed up, layed down maybe two verses, and JXL just sampled what he wanted out of that for a
track...)

Stores offer listening stations and sample before you buy?   Most websites
have 1-2 minute samples of the tracks on nearly every album.  Why do you
need to download the full length files via filesharing before buying it?

Maybe the songs get shitty immediately after those 1-2 minute samples. Gotta hear the whole thing just to make sure you're not being ripped off. ;)

Subject: {pb-cle} bargrooves: al fresco

Just picked up the latest installment in the bargrooves cd series "al
fresco".  If anyone likes good deep house this double mix cd is a definite
must have.  The first disc is mixed by Ben Sowton and the second is by
Justin Ballard.  I'm not the most informed deep house listener when it
comes to knowledge of DJs, labels, etc. but i do know good house when i
hear it.
peace
states

Yeah, its an endless cycle.   I just put out information so people can think
about it a little bit.  There is no doubt the industry is changing, but no
one really knows how yet.  People will always find a way to get free music.
I suspect that the generation raised on free music will always stay that
way.  If they shut down things like Kazaa and the "dumber" filesharing tools
and make $1 downloads commonplace instead of free music then the next
generation will have another mindset.   Then perhaps it will come full
circle and people will want to actually own the product again.  That's one
thought.  Digital music could become the mainstay, but then the record
weasels will all find another way to make money and a new set of problems
will develop.  The technoligies and times may change... but the politics
will stay the same.

I know a few dozen people who migrated through club trance to breaks,
techno, downtempo, and/or experimental.  Guess your friends are just

Subject: {pb-cle} LIVE HOUSE MUSIC

Their last show was the most amazing show I have *ever* seen in Cleveland.
I highly recommend checking this out, no matter what your musical taste is
it will entertain you and prehaps enhance your apprecation of dance music.
Please do yourself a favor and check it out.

this saturday - November 15 -
TORTURED SOUL
will be returning to MERCURY LOUNGE.

The cover will be either $5 of free.  21+

Tortured soul is known for their deep house anthems.  "How's your life",
"Might do something wrong", and "Fall in love".  While this is technically
electronic music... it is a bass player, a synth player, and a drummer.
Their  lyrics rock and are full of emotion (if i'm well by then you'll see
me singing along up front). This is fucking DOPE... really.

get educated....

There's a flaw in the $1 download logic though, you don't own the music
you pay for, you are merely granted a license, which still isn't enough
for a lot of consumers. The iTunes music store works for me as a mac
user... I've got an iPod and iTunes works great on my pc so I can share
between them. If you're a napster user or any number of the other $1
music stores that are commonplace now, the licensing can be a bit more
strict, and you're locked into all sorts of DRM headaches. (The same as
the iTunes music store, no doubt). 

There was a Slashdot article a while back about someone who moved from
the US to the UK after purchasing a bunch of iTunes music. As soon as he
changed his location on his mac, BOOM, all the music was gone. 

SO... you're still locked into whatever apple or whomever feels is fair
licensing, and they can revoke it at any given time. It's just retarded.
You're only safe if you burn it to CD right away, then re-rip it to some
non-DRM type of format. I say just send me the CD in the first place.

Sound samples have duped me before... and it helps to listen to unreleased 
music so you can pre-order that shit before most dudes know about it.

Having a copy of the track in full lets me hear the tune as if I were in a 
record store listening to it...and this is before the record even comes out. 
Eventually I'll get a bunch of fresh tunes, burn em, blast them in my car 
and I'll get to hear them on a good loud soundsystem. It really does help 
when you are short on cash and need to optimize your record shopping! Its 
all about getting the best records, and sometimes it takes hearing the 
entire track to make a good pick.  1-2 minutes might leave out a sappy 
vocal, and skip through a horrendously long breakdown.

Its luxury no doubt... why not take advantage? If I like the music I will 
buy the record. I don't have the money for a laptop or FS, vinyl appears to 
be more fun than that shit anyways.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

i guess they must be. even so, if any real % of people were moving
from trance to other genres, why are jokers like paul oakenfold
still selling massive amounts of tickets while most other genres
suffer? your trickle down EDM theory doesnt work. its voodoo
economics.

yeah, i mean home taping didnt actually kill music did it? neither
did used CD sales. but digital downloading will, right? yeah,
right. what it might kill is bullshit major labels, which is fine
by me. this is just the economics of the record industry
correcting itself. you cant keep increasing profits every year and
keep raising prices like they were doing, especially on the crap
they were putting out. whats funny is that this is going to happen
in the movie industry as well, though not to the same degree. even
though VHS never killed movies like it was supposed to, im
convinced that divx and shit will get the point across: you cant
keep churning out $200 million dollar special efx extravaganzas
that basically blow and keep expecting more and more people to buy
them (at higher and higher prices at the theatre nonetheless!)
just because you hype it up. the drop in product quality dictates
that those economics wont work. its funny that DVDs now cost
almost the same as CD's, cheaper in some instances considering how
much more expensive it can be to make a film. its actually
hilarious that the movie industry can at least figure out how to
keep raking in more money through DVD sales as they increase year
after year but the record companies cant figure out how to cut the
middlemen bullshit out of their operation to be able to drop
prices on their products. and it is those middle men guys and the
top executives who make all the money, the artists get jack shit.
i dont know why you stick up for those idiots time after time. do
you have family that works for a major label?

>There's a flaw in the $1 download logic though

in addition to your point, an article in the pgh post-gazette this
morning pointed out the price of the recent NOW music comp, vs the
price of DLing it tune by tune. you ended up paying more for it by
DLing it tune by tune than you would just going out to buy the CD,
and then youd be minus all the restrictions set on you by the
licensing racket. if record companies think theyre going to walk
in and charge MORE money for the same weak product with LESS
flexibilty than actually owning it on CD, theyre sorely fucking
mistaken. what morons. someone needs to teach these people
something........

New suckers are born every minute?  Or maybe the hands-up-in-the-air
trance has a higher retention rate.  I don't know.  I don't think I'm
qualified to judge.  But Paul isn't exactly packing them in like he used
to.  ALL of the genres have suffered, as the general popularity of EDM has
fallen.

Some people like it implies "they think it's better".  Better quality is
100% subjective.  What part of that did you miss?

Say what now?  If Paul's goal was to make the largest crowd possible have
a good time, did he fail?

Come on, you can do better than that.

Subject: {pb-cle} on the subject of apartments -- looking [cleveland]


I am looking for a one bedroom, around $400/month close enough to
downtown clevo. I don't want a big apartment complex. I want a place
where I can paint the walls any color if I want ... and free parking.

I know there's an apartment for me out there somewhere. I just need to
find it.

pretty high, while the turnover rate of other genres is much less.

but whose fault is this? this is exactly what im saying. the
people pushing crappy music like that have made it the face of
"techno" for all intents and purposes. the music has no depth.
people hear it, and they realise very quickly that all the
preconceptions they had of "techno" are true. and they pay it no
mind. and the high turnover rate of idiot raves and club people
eventually weeds through all the people who might be interested in
the crappy music to begin with.

okay, so i have my 1990 ford tempo. i say i think my car is better
than a Bently. does that mean that it must be just because i said
so? or does it make me a fucking moron who obviously cant tell the
difference between something thats good and something that is a
piece of shit? 

>Say what now?  If Paul's goal was to make the largest crowd

if his goal was to make the largest possible crowd of idiots have
a good time and make tons of cash off of them, he knocked it out
of the park. if his goal was to actually be a representative of
decent dance music and build a quality institution in mainstream
music, he failed quite miserably.

exactly. having a job isnt really selling out because there is no

can sell out very easily.

thats not even it. if youve ever seen real political bands, youd
understand. these guys are jokers. i can remember one of the first
shows they did after andy flag left the band. their singer was
going on some rant about how "carnegie was a motherfucker" etc etc
which was all fine and good and true. THEN, he proceeded to say
"the museum and library he 'donated' to the people is a farce. we
should burn them down." i almost shit myself. after that i think i
attended one more anti-flag show, and that was that.

what does that mean? in case you didnt notice, in the 80s
metallica was one of the greatest things going.

but did he ever start rapping about "bling bling" or selling drugs

selling out. if he can still get paid doing what he wants (which
is quite pure), then thats not selling out. if someone asked him
to guest on a 50 cent record and he did it, then that would be
another story.

How can you even begin to draw comparisons there?  Really?  At least you

copying a copy... well.. that just didn't happen.  Sound Quality?  Used
sales... didn't you have to leave the house and didn't one person have to

I stick up for the recording industry because I believe when you are
succesful you are willing to take chances and help everyone else out.  I
believe that "alternative" you speak of is getting crushed because the big
boys don't have anything left after taking care of their top priority.
"Fucking oveer the RIAA" does not hurt the big names hardley at all and they
can just charge higher tour prices to recoup.  "Fucking over the RIAA" helps
the c grade players... the ones who don't have polished skills to get signed

i've been debating it, especially jon tab, since he keeps posting these 
DC locals and has the DJ battle of locals but told the pittsburgh DJs 
pretty much to fuck off when they went to enter.

SOOOOOO let me know what you think about it, there are 2 of them, jon 
tab and cubik...
at least the cubik ones seem to have something maybe some pgh kids would 
drive for.

and please, lets not drudge up the paul oakenbutt discussion yet again.

planet x does a great job of making their audio clips sound 
badass.  when you listen to the entire track... sometimes you're 
not as impressed.  if i'm paying 10 dollars for a single sided 
piece of vinyl, i want to be sure that it's not boring as hell 
with one 30 "cool" section.

do you sell mix tapes/cds?
if so, are all the tracks cleared with the copyright holders?
are they paid from the sales of the cd?

well i guess technically someone could have received a promo and
then copied the tapes. i know i bought plenty of promos in used
shops. anyway, this is not the point. have you ever heard of the
boy who cried "wolf"? i know you have. the record companies have
cried wolf enough times that even if they are in real trouble this
time, the past dictates that you cant take them seriously because
theyre proven to be anti-consumer for so long.

priority.

how is this? they didnt suddently start bigging up good things all
those years they were making record profits in the 90s. the cycle
of major labels goes like this: find new genre, exploit it, run it
into the ground, start again. nothing good comes from it, except
periodically a couple good artists get wider exposure. 

>"Fucking oveer the RIAA" does not hurt the big names hardley at
all and they

and people will become increasingly unwilling to pay ridiculous
tour prices when they can get a perfect digital copy of the show
the next day with a filesharing program. there's going to be a
serious reality check here very soon. i cant wait. 

>"Fucking over the RIAA" helps

thats mostly not true. the best acts usually dont get signed to
major labels, and if they do they get some bullshit pulled on
them. early 90s grunge was an exception (mudhoney, tad, etc
probably didnt deserve major label support because their sound was
not commercial enough, and that showed in their  major label
records, which sold about dick and then they got dropped) as is
hiphop for the most part where the best emcees usually at least
get a shot at making major label records. of course one only needs
to look at the career of ll cool j or nas to see what major labels
can do for a great rapper. anyway, the point is majors sign only
what they think they can sell. theyre business people, not
artists. im sure some indie somewhere has dropped a band for poor
sales, but its not like the massive corporate droppings that occur
all the time.

Actually, we really don't sell many mixtapes or mix cd's that aren't =
legal these days.

We encourage all local cd's to be traded.  I say "leave one, take one to =
find out what other djs are up to".    90% are given away free to anyone =
who shows interest and buys something else.  Sometimes I charge $5 for =
the cd, but that rarely happens.=20

Mix cd's & tapes were around longer than filesharing and people don't =
generally buy a mix cd because of one track.  Djs who sell a cd with 10 =
anthems and sell them because of those anthems are garbage (expecially =
when they download all the tracks on that cd in the first place).  I =
don't believe techno mixtapes effect artist sales.  We've coverd this =
before.

The way I see it is that the label's only real purpose is to package up somebody's music and sell it to the people who want it. Well, we don't need them to do that anymore. All their thrashing around can't change the fact that they have become a useless middleman.

Musicians will make music whether or not they can become multimillionaires doing it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} my sellout was:Sellout for lunch box

the whole itunes/napster 2.0/whatever thing....
yeah it seems you don't own the song really unless you burn it cd.  but 
who wants to waste cds like that backing up 10-15 songs per cd when hard 
drive space is so cheap?
some of the services i've seen wont let you play the songs if you stop 
paying the monthly fees. definately a bad business model.
i've wondered though if you have itunes and all the stuff stored on your 
overpriced mac (and i guess now pc) and it goes up in a ball of fire.  
do they let you redownload the tunes?  or is it tied to that one computer?
my thinking on all this is fuckit.  i don't like DRM crap locking me 
into this kind of stuff where i have to worry about losing stuff.  or 
not being able to copy it here or there. artists need paid, but i'm 
hearing figures of 11 cents per 99 cent download going to the artist, 
the rest goes to pay for the itunes upkeep and the rest to the RIAA & 
the big 5 labels.  yes.  you read that right.   apple isn't making a 
fucking cent on this whole thing.  i guess its to sell iPods.....? 
damn, i wish i had the articles around, cant remember where i read them, 
it was one of the bigger tech pages.  zdnet?  i can't remember.

px also has a habit of cutting out ass vocals from
time to time...i've gotten a few records after
listening to their samples that had really bad vocals
on them that were nowhere to be found in the samples.

Subject: {pb-cle} struck a cord:sell-out/rich...

I see this subject has struck a cord with many of you.
 After some conversing over this subject with a few
friends in the promotional industry, I realized the
best way to organize this was to go the dictionary and
get the facts...

"Sell out" may be a negative or positive term. 
According to Webster.com refers to 3 major meanings...


1: to dispose of one's goods by sale; especially : to
sell one's business  OR 
2: to sell all the available tickets for b : to sell
all of <the merchandise was quickly sold out>
intransitive senses
3: to BETRAY one's cause or associates

Do you really feal that Oakenfold or any one else has
truely betrayed you?  I view betrayel in more of a
cheating aspect, as in your significant other, NOT as
a man who chose his career and where it leads. 
Oakienfold did not promise any of us anything, so why
expect anything.  Not a single dj/producer has. 
Taking the easy route is not a sell out.
Doing your own thing is not a sell out.
Making 6+ figures is not a sell out.
A sell out is a person who takes a cause they have
agreed to share and hurts that cause in one way or
another.  None of us had any agreement with him or any
other so-called sell out.  

I am disappointed to see that so many of you judge
with out being personaly involved.  The only person
one can sell out is oneself.  Karma will catch up to
you sometime.

The bently is physically, tangibly better than your ford tempo. It is 
engineered, it is mathematical. It is a fact that the Bently is is a much 
more efficient vehicle than your Ford Tempo.

Evil Dead II.

Is it a good movie because it is abso-fucking-lutely entertaining, or is it 
a crappy movie because its cheesy, has bad acting (I'm not talking about 
Bruce Campbell, hes the man), and has a low budget?

I rate art & entertainment based on the feeling and entertainment value I 
gain from it.

You aren't going to tell me what is good or what is bad when it comes to my 
emotions, thats just the way it is.

theres a problem in this thinking.
i'm not sure how many trax are on the NOW music comp?
i'll assume 15....?

so the cd costs 15$
buying 15 tunes costs 15$.  roughly the same.  maybe it had more tracks.
anyhow you don't get to PICK those 15 tracks on the NOW compilaiton. 
some marketing droid probably did.  do you trust his taste in music?
you might pay more per "cd" of music, but its a HANDPICKED "cd" worth of 
music.

exactly. so my opinions and emotions involving the ford tempo are
absolutely meaningless, just like the opinions of people who like
prog house.

now i guess i picked a slightly flawed example in the car
comparison because obviously in art lo-fi means of production are
quite effective (and in many cases, i prefer them). shit, just
look at the garbage equipment used to make the first techno and
house records and then look at the ultra expensive hi-fi shit used
to make the crappy prog records. its almost the exact opposite of
my example: in music and film, quite often you dont need to spend
tons of cash to make a great product. 

still the idea that quality is objective is pretty clear
nonetheless. look at the materials and precision that go into that
bentley. those arent compareable to the precision and high price
music software that goes into prog. its more compareable to the
quality songwriting and ideas that go into good music. 

>I rate art & entertainment based on the feeling and entertainment
value I

thats a pretty low standard. i mean, television is pretty
entertaining, right? are you going to then say that it is of
higher quality than bethoven's concertos simply because you derive
more entertainment from it? 

>You aren't going to tell me what is good or what is bad when it

i dont see why. im so right.

okay, you forced me to go find the specifics: 

20 tracks, retail price $12.98

20 tracks @ $.99 cents each = 19.80

thats a $6 difference to pay for the inconveniences inherent in
the "licensing" that these "legit" filesharing programs use, as
well as no actual product or album art, so if you want a
tracklisting and a cd to listen to in your car, you have to print
and buy and burn the disc, all added inconveniences in addition to
paying more right off the top. what a great business model.

<devils advocate>
piracy is piracy?  so its okay piracy when its mix cds, but not okay 
piracy when its filesharing?  piracy dubbing a cd to tape for a friend? 
this leave a cd take a cd system sounds vaguely like "sharing"?
</devils advocate>

i think we need a chart of good/bad piracy!!!

Yeaaaah BUT

It's $.99 a song, or $10 an album in most cases. The most I've seen an
"album" go for is like $16, audiobooks (the only thing I've bought) are
slightly more expensive... $15 for the abridged, ~$30 unabridged in most
cases. It's still a facist regime, but a slightly less pricey version
that thought. 

Plus, anyone who's actually USED one of these services know that they're
difficult to navigate and find what you want, about the only "techno"
you can find is Moby. The stores aren't meant for music fans, they're
meant for fans of people like Oakenf.... nevermind :)

About the only exception I've ever seen was emusic.com, which recently
pissed off all their customers, and labels. Labels like Tech Itch Rec,
Force Inc. etc., were all on emusic, and they were unlimited VBR mp3
downloads for $10 a month. They screwed that all up though, and now it's
back to being like every other retarded service.

again, of those 20 tracks?  do you like all 20?
15? 10? 3?
you hand select 20 tracks at buytunesinmypants.com at 20$.  do you like 
all 20?
you probably will.  at least more than on a cd SOMEONE ELSE PICKS THE 
TRACKS.
tom, don't buy single songs.  buy full cds. buy compilations. buy cd 
singles.  buy double LPs, buy 8 tracks, buy reel-to-reel.  i don't 
care.  thats the joy of a quasi-free market.

if i listen to a cd alot it gets ripped and put on my computer, where i 
can call it up instantly.  i probably only have 20-30 cds around right 
now and half are recently acquired from djs.  the rest are packed away 
and i don't really need the ones i'd want to listen to since they're 
already ripped and on my computer.
do i care about the cd jackets anymore?
no.
did i in the past? yes, but thats before google.  if i need to know who 
produced such and such, i can look it up in 10 seconds.

amanda asked me today about the post caps, and with all this lively 
semi-on topic discussion going on.... i've raised the cap to 30 msgs a 
day.  i think even tom can work with that?
don't abuse it.

im just saying, if they want to be able to compete with free,
theyre going to have to do alot better than that. if you could
pick a CD's worth (78 minutes is it?) of music for $10 and they
had a wide selection and allowed unlimited burning, theyd possibly
be on to something. in the mean time this is still an inferior
product to the already vastly inferior CDs that they sell. they
act like this is going to be revolutionary when all theyre doing
right now is taking the same kind of principle and just shaping it
differently. a turd is still a turd even if you replicate
michelangelo's "david" with it. theyre slowly coming along, but i
think if they want their jobs to survive at all, theyll be taking
pay cuts and we'll start seeing more viable alternatives. as some
of the more successful bands go it alone with online sales, i
think that will help things pick up as well.

this is exactly the problem. they say "okay, we'll charge you
slightly less money for inferior selection of an inferior product"
and they expect us to jump for joy? ha.

>again, of those 20 tracks?  do you like all 20?
>15? 10? 3?

this isnt necessarily the point im trying to make. all im saying
is that you cant even definitely get the same CD's worth of tracks
for cheaper than you can at a store despite all other
conveniences. this is really the major hurdle that the record
companies cant get their minds over. people dont want to pay tons
of money for crap.

the point is that theyre discriminating against songs depending on
what "format" you DL them in. say an album has 20 tracks. you DL
1, it costs $1. if you get it as part of a $10 album, the same
track costs $.50. this really isnt evening out anything. i mean it
was the record companies who decided to stop selling singles
because of their greed, not consumers. at least with a single when
you paid more than its % of the album cost you were paying for
additional packaging and production costs, which is
understandable. penalizing DLs in the same way for no additional
packaging and production cost is just more of the same old attitude. 

>and DRM, i don't like it, thats why i haven't looked into any of
these 
>buy a song for a buck things, but some people don't mind or know
better 
>about the DRM stuff ("digital rights management")

i think its mostly that they dont know better. i imagine that in
time people will become tired of dealing with the restrictions
they put on those programs. 

>if i listen to a cd alot it gets ripped and put on my computer,
where i 
>can call it up instantly. 

ill say that most people dont listen to music exclusively on their
computers. not everyone has a portable or car mp3 player which
means theyre going to want to burn CDs. why not take advantage of
the technology you already have? forcing people to use only the
rather expensive mp3 players isnt going to work long term which is
why i think apple's itunes thing wont maintain large market share
for very long. people have invested lots of money in CD
collections at this point, theyll be reluctant to change to purely
digital very quickly, if at all.  

>i probably only have 20-30 cds around right

like i said, this is not so much of a problem if youre listening
at your computer. on the road or with a personal CD player, thats
going to be much different.

<begin>

<devils advocate>
piracy is piracy?  so its okay piracy when its mix cds, but not okay=20
piracy when its filesharing?  piracy dubbing a cd to tape for a friend?=20
this leave a cd take a cd system sounds vaguely like "sharing"?
</devils advocate>

i think we need a chart of good/bad piracy!!!

</end>

Is it that difficult to understand?   Filesharing -- for most -- is =
typing "Madona - American Life" into the kazaa search engine and getting =
it for free.  Most independent dance labels do not look at mix tapes as =
a threat to their market.  People aren't downloading the new oakenfold =
cd just to get the latest john b trance mix.  This should be common =
sense.

However, there are DJs who only play music they get for free.  So when =
an independent track is shared as that (from start to finish) then the =
label looses revenue.    Just a short little lesson:  Roughly, to =
filesharing, I have lost 5 djs who spent an average of $80 a week on new =
music.  That's $400 a week.  That's $20,000 in sales a year in my store =
alone (not counting the super top40 jocks who shop at best buy etc.).   =
Say there are three similar stores in each state.  That's 60,000 x 52 =
states =3D 3 Million lost to shadey djs alone (and that is a really =
really low estimate).  Music lost in the industry by dj's who earn a =
living by stealing this music (playing madonna and cher remixes is NOT =
breaking new music either so don't even bother with that tired =
arguement).  How out of hand do you think this is in the mobile dj =
industry (which is much larger than the club and rave worlds combined =
and which i see ZERO business from.)  Am I mad?  yes.  As a retailer, it =
infuriates me that club owners give djs like these jobs.   As a dj it =
makes me wonder if I am a fool for buying the music I play?   It creates =
a paradox for me.  My goal as a dj is to expose the music I like so that =
other people can have experiences similar to me... yet how can I feel =
passionate about something I didn't earn myself?   As for watching =
people who claim to love to electronic music support this mindset, well =
it sickens me.  I don't see progress in getting our music out there.  As =
soon as Kazaa made lame ass coke head clubbers (the ones we are supposed =
to be educating) the ultimate experts on electronic music it sent us on =
a downward spiral.   One of my best friends and heavy supporters of P2P =
who has been around for ages recently wised up and removed all of it =
from his system.  He saw the hypocracy.

I don't dispute that SOME (the minority) of filesharing may serve a =
greater good.  It may expose some new music.  I don't, however, think =
those benefits outweigh the damage that has been done to the rest of the =
industry.  Most people are using it to further their own ignorance (ex:  =
typying oakenfold in to find the latest oakenfold mix).  I don't dispute =
that record labels are stupid (I could site countless examples). =20

Finally.  As I have said this before.  Discussing the cons of =
filesharing on the internet is like selling ICE to ESKIMOS.   It's =
pointless.  And with that I end all discussion on the topic.

Subject: {pb-cle} "playlistism"

here's a sort of a related topic to the iTunes thing.......

okay, so wired picked up this college kids article on "playlistism"..... 
which is judging a person by their iTunes playlists which are shared 
across networks. stephen aubrey explains it best: "Forget discriminating 
people based on their race, religion, gender, or colloquial term for 
four-square, its all about playlistism. Thats right, judging people by 
their iTunes playlist."

the wired article - http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,61177,00.html

heres stephen aubrey's original article that kicked it off - 
http://www.wesleyan.edu/argus/archives/nov042003/dateyear/w1.html

i suppose this can be applied to soulseek since you can look at a single 
persons music content all in one place too.

When did I tell the pittsburgh djs to fuck off?  I never said anything
remotely close to that. you did ask if a pbcle dj would be considered local
in dc/bmore =8B and I replied with an emoticon indicating that would be
stretching it. :-)=20

I don=B9t think right now is a good time for the US EDM scene to be bickering
over regional promotion, especially when dc and pb are only 4 hours apart.
I=B9m interested in reading what goes on in pbcle as I am in dc/bmore -- whic=
h
DJs you guys are into, what events occur, what styles of music are popular,
etc.

Cross-pollination of ideas is healthy and constructive =8B something all loca=
l
EDM scenes need if we want to revitalize things in a healthier direction.
Maybe someone will start up a strictly locals dj competition event in your
area b/c they saw that it was successful here in DC?

This DJ competition event has really helped me
1. determine what the most popular style of EDM today=B9s next generation DJ=B9=
s
are spinning.
2. determine which of these DJ=B9s have both skills and drawing power
3. book as many local dj=B9s as possible to spin Thursdays at a venue they
have partied in for years.  It=B9s physically impossible to book on Fridays
every single DJ request we get.

I combine the Thursday ALIAS event with the Friday Cubik/Buzzlife info in
the same email =8B to avoid sending two separate emails in the interest of
promotional thrift.  If other people promote events in DC on your list, I
should hope that you=B9d keep each of us separate.

Respectfully,
John Tab

Take it for what it is.  Plenty of people feel the need to put others down
on the way to the top.  Really I'm not trying to say that everyone is a
ladder climbing no-talent wannabe --- but I am pointing out that there are
plenty who don't care what negativety use in their attempt to get to the
top.  Beware of those types is all I'm saying.  I still stand by my
statement that if you subscribe to non-mainstream philosophies then you
wouldn't go around calling people sell-outs.   That's my point.  I used the
word poseur because it is the age old answer to the term sell-out.   Just
trying to get people to think instead of standing on either side of the
issue.

Why the sarcasm?  That first quote was miswritten by me, btw.  It was

Yeah, I'll agree there.  Maybe the intake rate is quite a bit higher for
that, as well.

Fault?  I don't think one can lay 'fault' for the fall in popularity of
all EDM genres.

If you truly think that your Tempo is better, then it is better, from your
viewpoint.

You're also comparing physical goods, as opposed to 'music'.  Comparing a
$500k vehicle to a $500 vehicle?  Let's make it fair.  Offer any producer
(who needs the money) $500 to write a song.  Then offer them $500k to
write a song.  See which seems better to you; I'd bet the $500k worth of
work.

On the other hand, someone will probably like the $500 better, and to
them, it is.

Subjective, in a nutshell.

To an individual, better to them is better.  Obviously.

I'd agree.  But neither of us have a clue what makes him tick.

well the RIAA does, i've read about several stores getting raided and 
pretty much anything on a cd-r was confiscated, apparently even local 
bands cds.....  i do not recall if charges were brought or what the 
final outcome will be.

also maybe of interest, they're going after karaoke djs using unlicensed 
stuff.  they nailed someone in indiana not too long ago.

I used to see 10-30 Pittsburgh kids a week for Buzz@Nation.  Buzz is now
Cubik... most of the same people, same venue, different name.  Cubik
doesn't have as many people coming down for it, that I've seen.

Dunno.  Personally, I'll be there for Friction, Green Velvet, RITM, and a
few others.

well every medium has its costs.  online sales involve people to encode 
the tracks, write the database, setup the servers, someones gotta pay 
the bandwidth.  there are costs to online music distribution.  what the 
end figures are i couldn't fathom a guess.  cheaper than cds?? i dunno.  
they price fix those anyhow, so i'm sure theres fixing going on with the 
99 cent tunes as well.  hell aren't cassettes still 10$??

well i don't own a working cd player other than my cd-rom.  oh and my 
dvd player hooked up to the tv.  we're talking high fidelity there!
i used to have a minidisc player, i'd setup discs of whatever, and kept 
that in the car.  worked ducky till the thing fell off a couch about 1.5 
feet onto carpet and broke. 
anyhow the best way to do this IMO is to have an ipod-type device.  what

Subject: {pb-cle} Record sales


Anyone else see the statistic that record stores now sell 33% of what they
did four years ago?  That included online vendors, etc...

Imagine if Ford lost 2/3rds of it's business, in four years.

And in those four years, a new technology had been growing.  The new
technology was a way for Ford owners to make perfect copies of their Ford,
that they could give away for free, without much fear at all of being
caught.

My last Ford had about the duration of a pop band.  It had an enormous
profit margin built in for the dealer and the manufacturer.  It was made
to appeal to the mainstream.

I'd think the difference is a material good, that took hundreds of
man-hours to build and assemble.  The designers of the Ford were paid a
salary, and the builders were paid a salary.  Music ain't material; there
isn't much to 'build', except the print of the CD, and MP3s are making
that irrelevant.

So the middlemen are getting fucked.

Now, if only robotics would advance to the point of being able to build a
decent car...

I wonder how many people reading the list have copies of 
Windows/Office on their machines that weren't exactly legal.  It's 
good piracy if you are only taking advantage of the people making 
billions of dollars, right?  I mean, what home chap has 2600 
dollars to buy the freshest Win2k3 enterprise server release?

Doug, I think you're missing the point.  The people you have 
attacked on the list for using file sharing are not the people 
that have 'damaged' the rest of the industry.  Tom spins vinyl.  
He listens to mp3's and purchases based off what he hears.  When I 
spun at havana last thursday I played 3 tracks off of CD.  2 were 
remixes that I had created, 1 was a track that I couldnt find 
anywhere on vinyl in as short of time after I first heard it to be 
able to play it out (jazzanova - mwela [bugz mix]).  The deejays 
that I know are taking large advantage of the file sharing are the 
club deejay's at the 'meat-market' clubs.  What the RIAA should do 
is spot check large clubs, and create a setlist, then check the 
deejay's actual collection, if they dont have it, then go after 
those people.. i know they're making more than "free drinks".  
They're the ones that are exploiting the file sharing community.  
These aren't the same people that are here arguing about why file 
sharing is good vs why you say it is bad.  There is no way to 
regulate it, so therefore you'd be happier if no one had access to 
file sharing because it would allow you to sleep at night because 
your CD single sales came back up, while at the same time, I'd 
have to hunt hard to be able to listen to a track before i would 
decide to email kelly carter and tell her to order something for 
me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} my sellout was:Sellout for lunch box

I haven't been following this argument at all but could it be possible that
djing is stale and people don't care about it as much as they once did?
People are fickle and I'm sure the majority are moving on to mullets and
80's remixes.  Maybe they want to join a band and play a monosynth while
singing into a vocoder.  Things change and the dj tool is out of favor.
Everybody and their brother's friends sister became a dj it was only a
matter of time before the bottom fell out of it like every thing else that
is blown up into mainstream consumption.

<begin>

<devils advocate>
piracy is piracy?  so its okay piracy when its mix cds, but not okay
piracy when its filesharing?  piracy dubbing a cd to tape for a friend?
this leave a cd take a cd system sounds vaguely like "sharing"?
</devils advocate>

i think we need a chart of good/bad piracy!!!

</end>

Is it that difficult to understand?   Filesharing -- for most -- is typing
"Madona - American Life" into the kazaa search engine and getting it for
free.  Most independent dance labels do not look at mix tapes as a threat to
their market.  People aren't downloading the new oakenfold cd just to get
the latest john b trance mix.  This should be common sense.

However, there are DJs who only play music they get for free.  So when an
independent track is shared as that (from start to finish) then the label
looses revenue.    Just a short little lesson:  Roughly, to filesharing, I
have lost 5 djs who spent an average of $80 a week on new music.  That's
$400 a week.  That's $20,000 in sales a year in my store alone (not counting
the super top40 jocks who shop at best buy etc.).   Say there are three
similar stores in each state.  That's 60,000 x 52 states = 3 Million lost to
shadey djs alone (and that is a really really low estimate).  Music lost in
the industry by dj's who earn a living by stealing this music (playing
madonna and cher remixes is NOT breaking new music either so don't even
bother with that tired arguement).  How out of hand do you think this is in
the mobile dj industry (which is much larger than the club and rave worlds
combined and which i see ZERO business from.)  Am I mad?  yes.  As a
retailer, it infuriates me that club owners give djs like these jobs.   As a
dj it makes me wonder if I am a fool for buying the music I play?   It
creates a paradox for me.  My goal as a dj is to expose the music I like so
that other people can have experiences similar to me... yet how can I feel
passionate about something I didn't earn myself?   As for watching people
who claim to love to electronic music support this mindset, well it sickens
me.  I don't see progress in getting our music out there.  As soon as Kazaa
made lame ass coke head clubbers (the ones we are supposed to be educating)
the ultimate experts on electronic music it sent us on a downward spiral.
One of my best friends and heavy supporters of P2P who has been around for
ages recently wised up and removed all of it from his system.  He saw the
hypocracy.

I don't dispute that SOME (the minority) of filesharing may serve a greater
good.  It may expose some new music.  I don't, however, think those benefits
outweigh the damage that has been done to the rest of the industry.  Most
people are using it to further their own ignorance (ex:  typying oakenfold

are stupid (I could site countless examples).

Finally.  As I have said this before.  Discussing the cons of filesharing on
the internet is like selling ICE to ESKIMOS.   It's pointless.  And with
that I end all discussion on the topic.

You act like I enjoy progressive house because it was made primarily by 
white people and expensive machines.

What an asshole.

I listen to music because I think it sounds cool and I enjoy listening to 
it.

And expensive machines? Come on man. Who gives a fuck?

Man makes tool. Man uses tool.

Maybe we should all go back to banging rocks and sticks together and regress

Sorry dude, I've had more fun with my nintendo and horror movies than I ever

That doesn't mean I don't appreciate Beethoven's music, but I am going to do 
what is more enjoyable.

That includes not stroking my wang to 15 minutes of boring stagnant minimal 
techno that was made by a $2 bit processor and an empty coconut by a 
starving hermaphrodite from Chimbote, Peru.

I wonder how many people reading the list have copies of
Windows/Office on their machines that weren't exactly legal.  It's
good piracy if you are only taking advantage of the people making
billions of dollars, right?  I mean, what home chap has 2600
dollars to buy the freshest Win2k3 enterprise server release?

Doug, I think you're missing the point.  The people you have
attacked on the list for using file sharing are not the people
that have 'damaged' the rest of the industry.  Tom spins vinyl.
He listens to mp3's and purchases based off what he hears.  When I
spun at havana last thursday I played 3 tracks off of CD.  2 were
remixes that I had created, 1 was a track that I couldnt find
anywhere on vinyl in as short of time after I first heard it to be
able to play it out (jazzanova - mwela [bugz mix]).  The deejays
that I know are taking large advantage of the file sharing are the
club deejay's at the 'meat-market' clubs.  What the RIAA should do
is spot check large clubs, and create a setlist, then check the
deejay's actual collection, if they dont have it, then go after
those people.. i know they're making more than "free drinks".
They're the ones that are exploiting the file sharing community.
These aren't the same people that are here arguing about why file
sharing is good vs why you say it is bad.  There is no way to
regulate it, so therefore you'd be happier if no one had access to
file sharing because it would allow you to sleep at night because
your CD single sales came back up, while at the same time, I'd
have to hunt hard to be able to listen to a track before i would
decide to email kelly carter and tell her to order something for
me.
---------------------------------------------------------------

I'm sorry for coming of confrontational about something I am somewhat
passionate about.   I understand that some listee's do support the music
they download - in fact most do.  Mainstream Amercia is NOT the same.  A
couple people in this thread mentioned they would never buy music again.   I
guess I'm hoping that those who take the time to justify the benefits of
filesharing realize they are also part of the problem by justifying the
cause of those hoping to get a free ride.

Personally I say things like Kazaa are bad.   Soulseek is debateable.  Most
people I know who have access to fresh mp3s do it through the slightly less
user friendly and more underground world of ftps.  Not through user friendly
search engines.

you should all be so lucky. its okay man, we'll see when 30 years
from now prog records are a dime a dozen and people are hunting
down good records just like they do now with funk soul and jazz
stuff that might not have received its propers at the time. its
always pretty fun to know when youre listening to music that will
later be considered classic while others are listening to throw

thats not what IM saying. im just saying that the record companies
need to address 2 things primarily: cost and quality of their
product. what theyre doing now is addressing neither, which is why
i think it makes no sense. i think people would be much more
willing to spend money on sappy pop shit that the record companies
feel like putting out if it didnt cost them way more than its worth.

what the

dunno.  

there are lots of costs associated with CDs that are totally
removed in online sales. every single copy of each CD has to sit
in a location, and there are hundreds of shops that sell CDs. that
costs money to have that shop open and paying those people that
work there as well as making a profit for the shop. same goes for
the distributors. and then you have the shipping inbetween
pressing and distro, distro and shop. even with the overhead of
the bandwidth and servers necessary for this kind of thing, you
can make regional servers and disc space is getting much much much
cheaper. plus all profit (if the online services were run by the
labels themselves) would go to one place, meaning a probable
increase in actual profit despite a drop in total overall price. 

>they price fix those anyhow, so i'm sure theres fixing going on
with the 
>99 cent tunes as well.  hell aren't cassettes still 10$??

im not sure how much cassettes cost, actually. but yeah theres
some kind of collusion thats going to go on here because thats the
reality of the music biz currently. 

>well i don't own a working cd player other than my cd-rom.  oh
and my 
>dvd player hooked up to the tv.  we're talking high fidelity there!

yeah the only CD player i have in addition to my computer is the
playstation and a single disc in my alarm clock that i use when
falling asleep. oh yeah my mom actually gave me this portable CD
player recently that she won somewhere, its the first portable cd
player ive ever owned. really i use CDs because everyone else
does, so when transporting music i can just bring a book of CDs. i
never even had a CD burner until recently, and thats only for
burning my production related stuff for backing up and listening
on other soundsystems. but we're definitely not the norm here
traat, if that was ever in question 

; ) 

>anyhow the best way to do this IMO is to have an ipod-type
device.  what 
>are they up to now 20-40 gig?  thats alot of music.   just keep it 
>backed up somewhere!

yeah theyre big. but they still cost a good bit compared to a good
old cd player. plus no matter how you look at it, mp3s are a step
down in sound quality from CDs. to overcome that you really need
to lower the prices on mp3 players. im a big fan of the cd players
with mp3 decoders in them. i think that technology will likely be
the one that is most widely adopted.

well it must be working out alright for them, but its still not
beneficial to most people because of their small market share. but
thats what theyre into, so whatever. i still find it so
entertaining that ANYONE would want an ipod for their price
considering the other products out there. my gf's archos
multimedia jukebox was $400 a year ago with a color screen and 20
gb HD. the prices on those have dropped, but a 20 gig ipod costs
more for a grey screen but in a smaller package. who knows. people
like style over substance.

where did you get that stat from? it sounds false or exaggerated.
i think sales of music have declined something like 9%. i cant see
how that translates into a vast majority of sales being lost. its
just not possible.

i'd have to agree with this statement, although i
don't necessarily believe that this state of things is
permanent. most of the brothers' friends' sister will
stop spinning when they get frustrated with said
state, leaving only those who really love it behind.
or maybe this is wishful thinking. either way.

hahahahaha. the place for tempos is when youre broke as a
motherfucker and youre not trying to have a job. the great thing
about music is that it all costs approximately the same, good or
bad. rich or poor you can have good taste. if all cars were the
same price, then youd start to see the quality emerge. and i bet
after a little while, SUV sales would go way down once the
influence of their former "value" went away.

>
>What an asshole.

hahahahaha. you love me paul ; P 

all im saying about that is that those are tools of the major
labels (and in the case of gear, musical instrument companies) use
to make profits. thats why they exist, not because of some
objective reality that makes white people better musicians or
newer more expensive technology sound better. its actually funny
because all digital music is lower in sound quality than analogue.
all digital sound is is tiny bits of sampled sound played back
really close together. digital does have its conveniences, but
actual quality isnt one of them. 

>I listen to music because I think it sounds cool and I enjoy
listening to 
>it.
>
>And expensive machines? Come on man. Who gives a fuck?

the people who put out those machines to get people to spend TONS
of money on them when they dont need them to make good tunes. its
all about the flow of money here. most things people want are
artificially built up by marketing and hype. 

>Man makes tool. Man uses tool.

banging rocks and sticks together makes some good music, dont
sleep it. seriously. pop music is funny like this though. you look
at violins. stradavarius' are generally considered to be fucking
fantastic instruments. theres no new model every year at a higher
price trying to sucker people into buying it like there is with
synths or EFX processors or whatever. recognizing quality over
hype extends from music to the actual instruments its made with.
its a recurring theme in capitalist economies.

im not going to deny that i love me some video games. would i try

superior? hell no.

Subject: {pb-cle} Record sales (big long post)

Dean said:
<<Anyone else see the statistic that record stores now sell 33% of what they did four years ago?
That included online vendors, etc...>>

Then Tom said:
<<where did you get that stat from? it sounds false or exaggerated. i think sales of music have
declined something like 9%. i cant see
how that translates into a vast majority of sales being lost. its just not possible. >>

By "sell", are we talking about straight sales (as in, they're down 33%) or are we talking about
what they're OFFERING for sale. If so, I can TOTALLY agree with that. I've been in a couple of the
"dedicated media" chain stores lately (like sam goody and fye) and their selection is PATHETIC. I
couldn't find a Prince album except for "Purple Rain" and his greatest hits comps. THAT WAS IT. In
almost all of them. Not even his 2001 or 2003 releases were available. That was astounding.

I think Dean's figures are not that far off, Tom. And I'll explain why. I started a post on this
yesterday and realized it was sort of off-topic of the thread, but now that it's been busted open, I
think I'll revisit it.

Keep in mind here that we're talking about record stores and sales and (mostly) mainstream music.
And by that I'm including the bigger chains (like Sam Goody, FYE, and such) and the bigger
labels...if for no other reason than they tend to keep track of these things moreso than the
independent stores and underground labels that we tend to support.

Throughout all this talk of dropping sales and "Internet Piracy", many people have neglected to
mention one of the BIGGEST, most GLARING problems, that everyone seems to miss: There are actually
FEWER OPTIONS on the musical horizon in terms of availability to purchase.

Here's how it's working: (warning...long and boring case study of the record industry...skim if you
don't want to read the whole thing)

A vast majority of radio stations in America (read: the largest PROMOTIONAL outlets for MUSIC) are
owned or being bought up by lear hannel, either literally, or via the advertising dollars, the
smaller networks or independent stations tend to have to follow suit to maintain market share.

Clear Channel distributes the playlists to all of their stations uniformly (well, the ones with the
similar formats, anyway. top 40 stations get 1 top 40 playlist. rock stations get a rock playlist,
etc.). This leads to less and less variety and more homogeneity in the different areas of the
country.

Where you could once go to another city like New York and be blown away by the variety of music
being played on radio there, now it's pretty much all the same. (And, please, let's not discuss
independent or public radio here. I'm not talking about the niche stations with smaller market
share.) Kiss 96.1 in Pittsburgh is painfully similar to Kiss xx.x in Chicago, New York, Phoenix, and
on and on....

This is all translating to mass-homogeneity in the radio spectrum. This, in turn, leads to fewer and
fewer "regional hits" (a song that does well, say, in the North East as opposed to being a Billboard
#1 all over the country). These hits were common from the birth of rock up to the 80's.

So with the rampant homogeneity, this leads to fewer and fewer artists breaking big nationally due
to a regional hit catching on elsewhere. There's only so much room at the top for a number one song,
and many artists are "repeat offenders" in that aspect (Ashanti had back to back #1's with her debut
and follow up singles...figure that out.) Have you noticed that there are fewer "one hit wonders"
these days? Hmmm, I wonder why?

With fewer and fewer regional acts crossing over to larger markets, this leads to fewer and fewer
artists to choose from, cause many are back working at the 7-11 since they can't get their local
station to play their tune because the corporate folks are making the playlists and handing them
down to the outlets.

Over time, this then leads to the RIAA-backed labels (especially the Big 5) releasing fewer and
fewer albums.

And all this eventually leads us to where we are now: The Big 5 are released something like 12 to 20
thousand fewer new albums (collectively, I'm not referring to back-catalog sales) in 2002 vs. 2001,
the first year they started earnestly charting the effect of Internet piracy on the music industry.
Sales were down.

Could this possibly be coincidence? Somehow, I don't think so.

The RIAA and the labels themselves are now reaping what they've sowed. They have, over the course of
two decades, intentionally closed off the routes to creating, marketing and distributing music into
this very nice, neat little incestuous, very trust-like method of making and promoting music, and
what they've done is paint themselves into a corner.

They've attempted to tell people what to listen to, and MAKE hit records instead of allowing it to
happen naturally or organically like it did in the dawn of the rock and roll music era.

They slowly phased out singles, forcing customers to buy full albums for the one song they wanted.

To top that off, when they WERE making a profit, they continued to raise prices when no new
technologies or developments were being made in the field of sonic reproduction. They sat back and
cashed in, and then when MP3 came along as a ridiculously cheap alternative to buying

And now they're blaming the consumers...the same consumers who've lined their pockets for
decades...for being pissed about how they've been screwed for years and then finding alternate
methods of finding new music, when in reality, they've actually caused 90 percent of their own
problems by their greedy, blind practices.

I have no sympathy for them, nor for any other retailer who acts as a shill for these charlatans and
scheisters. They're getting exactly what they deserve, and if the system has to completely implode
on itself in order for it to be rebuilt and be something good and viable again, so be it.

The people I have sympathy for are the small-time, independent and specialized retailers like Milk
(and presumably Doug's store, too, if I'm getting it right that he's got a store that sells
independent music). They're feeling the pinch caused by people's backlash to the big-boy's system,
and they're also caught in the trap. If we lose them, we'll be losing a great great service that
continues to stand for what is good and right about making music for people to enjoy.

I agree with this, but you aren't going camping with your Tempo and you 
aren't saving gas with a McClaren F1.

Going on ski trips was so much less of a hassle when I had my Blazer.

I can't fit dick into this Saturn and now I get stuck in the snow.

I don't think we should associate genres with the evils of major record 
labels...  It is not what Sasha and Diggers have led so many to believe. At 
least not for me. There is a lot of prog house that not many people like and 
even know about (but popularity shouldn't be an issue when deciding music.)

This goes for any genre. I'm sure there are trance producers out there 
wanting to make trance for themselves and not to make a buck. I'm sure there 
are techno producers out there playing and making techno for money... but 
you associate these genres with a pop-star mentality and it ruins it for 
everyone out there.

A genre is just a description, a weak classification. Its got nothing to do 
with the lame intentions of man.

...and WTF? You act like prog is so much more popular than techno. Dude, 
nobody likes Prog house in this city, much less the prog that I spin. That 
doesn't really bother me though...

Why buy machines when you can use software and a midi controller? They are 
easily the most popular forms of making EDM nowadays...

Just because you produce for a certain genre doesn't limit you to particular 
equipment? What leads you to believe that? The fact that the genre is not 
"100% pure techno"?

I'm sure all the poster boys of a genre are being payed to promote their new 
product, but thats only because they are rich and greedy and they could care 
less. Its got nothing to do with your peers making music they and you enjoy 
alike.

I wasn't arguing that point at all, I completely agree.

actually, getting completely off topic.  I went to some assembly plant and
they said that from start to finish the assembly takes 23 or 25 hours
(know it was one hour off from 24) per car.  Now that doesn't included the
time for stamping or assebly of all the modules.  just a little FYI

to reiterate my stand on DC, some pgh ppl drive down for bigger stuff is 
my assumption. so posting stuff with headliners is okay. but i haven't 
really heard any opinions either way on it, so i'll probably let them 
get posted. well dean said people from pgh used to go to buzz that he 
knew of and he was going to some shows, but didn't say yay or nay on the 
emails. maybe a yay. and curt kinda said nay.
maybe noone cares.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootchs can afford stradivarius

the reason the price of stradivarius vilions go up each year is cuz of a few 
reasons.

1. the wood they are made from is from virgin forests...as forstery 
increases the supply of virgin wood falls and the price rises

2. the art of making strings for the strativarius is becoming a dying art.

3. the art of hand crafting a violin is also becoming a dying art.

so cuz of 2 and 3 the craftsman can demand and rightly recieve more money

comparing a stradivarious to a triton or any other synth is riddiculous...a 
stradivarious really is worth what they charge for it

a triton isnt.



Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootchs can afford stradivarius

the reason the price of stradivarius vilions go up each year is cuz of a few 
reasons.

1. the wood they are made from is from virgin forests...as forstery 
increases the supply of virgin wood falls and the price rises

2. the art of making strings for the strativarius is becoming a dying art.

3. the art of hand crafting a violin is also becoming a dying art.

so cuz of 2 and 3 the craftsman can demand and rightly recieve more money

comparing a stradivarious to a triton or any other synth is riddiculous...a 
stradivarious really is worth what they charge for it

a triton isnt.



Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

just try to understand my comparison though. imagine some company
came out saying "this is the best violin ever, its better than a
stratavarius". would you believe them? no. and the reason is that
the violin is a simple instrument, its all about the right tone.
electronic music is the same way. even the most complicated
modulars are usually only set up to be monophonic. why people need
50,000 note polyphony and 97 part multitimbral synths is beyond
me. the point is you dont need it, but music companies push the
product on the idea that your old stuff is outdated and no longer
suffices to make good music, which just isnt true. its the same
kind of marketing that the music that utilizes said new equipment
uses to sell itself.

to do with the materials used and how good the craftsman was.

its just the natural progression of technology...if they can put more
features into something...which the majority of ppl are gonna dig...they are
gonna do it...some sounds do require polyphony...like the moving pads and
ambient sounds found on tritons...u just cant program those sounds on a mono
synth....you might not be into that sound, but there are enough ppl that are
to justify a company to put it out...im sure if someone offered you a dope
deal on an original DX-7 you'd take it...or any other classic poly synth for
that matter.

that may be true to an extent...but instrument makers are in business to
make money...they know that big time pop studios will buy into any new
technology and rape the presets as soon as it comes to market..

there is a whole other side to the coin too....vintage craze...everybody and
their brother is putting out "vintage" products....hell manley and avalon
make millions of dollars a year selling 60 year old technology! alot of this
reissue stuff probably wont even make it 5 years before it craps out...but
thats a whole other topic.

in the end it comes down to this....instruments are just tools...its all in
how they are used...the best producers use everything availible to them...to
say new technology is worthless is really an ignorant comment to make.


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

there ARE people that use that, that isn't you or me.  some of these 
ones that are multitimbral are done in software, so there's really no 
overhead.  the nord modular.  add parts until it "fills up" the full 
blown one can do 4 separate patches.  don't tell me you wouldn't use 
that multimbrality if you had it?  one thing people on the nord list 
wished for was MORE of it.
so why not give 128, and most people will use 1-12 or so.   overkill is 
better than underkill.

see the overkill comment.  in most cases you aren't really paying for 
that, its clever hardware management.

let people believe that,  you can buy it secondhand.  hell at one point 
the 303s were thrown out or sold for 50$.  stores wanted them out of the 
showroom wasting space.  one mans trash is another mans acid tweak box.

-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Nov 15                  GLOBAL SPACE PROJECT                       DC??

Charles Feelgood
buzz dc/system recordings los angeles/ funky house, techno
Revered for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore / Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood (born Charles Fields) has 
earned a stellar reputation as a top-flight DJ in the international dance 
music community through his ingenious mixing skills and dynamic brand of 
funky disco house.
	
Scott Henry
buzz/fever, dc / ethereal techno w/ funky edge
By no means your average DJ, Scott Henry goes well beyond the time-honored 
tradition of rocking dancefloors. Granted, the man's long been an East 
Coast legend, having started the coast's most esteemed club nights-Fever 
in Baltimore and Buzz in Washington D.C, respectively, but Scott's role in 
American club culture outside of DJ'ing has now proven to be as important, 
if not more so, than his prowess behind the one and two's.
	
Anthony Paul - GSP Resident
Raven Productions, Progressive house / techno
	
Anthony Paul has made a name for himself in the EDM community with not 
just his skills behind the decks but with his uncanny energy and his love 
for the music. Hes gone from promoter to producer and has also helped 
push the music scene in Virginia. He is definetlya force to be reckoned 
with.
Ethernet - GSP Resident
Autodefrost / VA Techno, Live
	
DJ Ethernet has been playing all things techno for about 5 years in 
Virginia and its surrounding area with the collective Autodefrost. His 
furious mixing style of techno and on the fly remixing keeps the floor in 
constant motion.
	
Karri On - GSP Resident
Soulsations, vinyl house
	
Karri Ons style of swirling deep disco and jazz kept in time by chunky 
kicks, vocal edits and subbier than sub bass envelopes any room. She is 
one of those DJs that exude a particular style, 3 records into the set 
and you know she is on.
Antidote - GSP Resident
Progressive House and Techno
	
Progressing from trance to house to techno and back, Antidote doesnt seem 
to have a style, but plays what fits the mood. I dont mind playing hard 
or soft-house techno, what makes it all worthwhile is pumping the crowd, 
whatever Im spinning - Music is the cure for whatever it is that ails 
you.

Tue Nov 18                         HYBRID                         Cleveland

They are a hybrid of deep progressive breaks and of progressive house. 
They are a hybrid of live performance and DJ performance. They are HYBRID, 
and they are coming to Cleveland Tuesday November 18! 

Supporting DJ performance by Deviant of HeadRush Music. More details to 
come.

Peabody's 2083 East 21st St. downtown, behind the RascalHouse

Hybrid is Mike Truman and Chris Healings from Swansea South Wales. They 
are the accomplished architects of house and progressive breakbeat who 
ventured further beyond the ecstatic knee-jerk response of the dancefloor 
by fusing their beats with powerful orchestral and cinematic soundscapes. 

Hybrid formed back in 1993 after bonding over Truman's remix of Pink 
Floyd's 'Another Brick In The Wall. They debut LP, 'Wide Angle' (released 
1999) and its sister release 'Wider Angle' (remixes and live recordings of 
Japan tour) sold a total of 100,000 copies world wide. This lead to Mike 
and Chris DJing and performing live in the UK, Asia, Australia and USA. 

The deep lush strings of Wide Angle were recorded in Russia courtesy of 
the 90-piece Moscow Federal Orchestra. The album's emotional hit was both 
subtle and timeless. "We like making music that will last," explains 
Healings. "Music that isn't disposable. We want people to listen to it 
over and over again in the future." "Music you can play before you go out 
and listen to when you chillout," continues Truman. 

Hybrid opened this decade with 'Kid 2000' featuring the sensuous vocals of 
The Pretenders Chrissie Hynde. "When you hear very formulated European 
house music the emotional content is almost nil," explains Truman. "You 
know exactly where its going, you can even tell where the samples are 
from. There's nothing in it to make you happy or melancholic. We aim to 
instil a strong emotional content into our music." 

The outstanding reviews and success of their debut went cosmic:Hybrid, 
support act for MOBY in America, are collecting celebrity admirers. 
GILLIAN ANDERSON of the X Files and rocker TOMMY LEE hung around their 
dressing room like starstruck teenagers. The Sun October 2000. The Moby 
US tour (2000) lasted nine weeks with 48 performances.

LITTLE LOUIE VEGA
FRIDAY NOVEMBER 21
CLEVELAND


.:Wish Nightclub is proud to present Dance Ritual featuring Little Louie
Vega:.

**

Little Louie Vega will be headlining on Friday November 21st at Wish's
"Reintroducing Wish Party".

Little Louie" Vega is the Miles Davis of dance music. Like the impossible
to categorize Davis, Vega is constantly reinventing himself and
revolutionizing music itself in the process. During his nearly two-decade
long career, Vega has crafted some of the most innovative singles in dance
music history ("The Nervous Track", "It's Alright", "I Feel It" and "You
Can Do It"), kick started genres like soulful house ("Beautiful People,"
"I Get Lifted"), and revitalized the careers of legends like Roy Ayers,
George Benson and Tito Puente.

Rob Black will be warming up the tables and dance floor as he is back to
his old legendary residency on Friday nights. Also, let's not forget about
Mike Metz in the Martini Bar spinning great soulful house lounge music.

We have just recently put in an Arabica coffee bar for that late night
pick me up...or that early on espresso martini!

Please come out to what should be an unbelievable night.

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE

Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each
other.  These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we
danced all night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower
ourselves as one tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the
power of these sites was released into our bodies, giving us strength and
connecting us to Gaia.  Then the religions of fear took hold. They
destroyed our sacred sites and our rituals, burning all who dared to
question. But the power could not be suppressed forever and the great
cycles of time have brought us full circle to this new moment and we
gather once again. The ancient memory has been reawakened, the all night
dance ritual has returned. We are once again experiencing the mystical
power of the Trance.

legendary. He is standing firm currently in DJMixed.com/BPM's Top 100 and 
ready to show Buffalo what underground dance music is all about!

Yeah -- definately.

Sometimes I get all wrapped up in things I get excited about to remember the
other QUALITY events out there. Ryan Papa will be a great show.  If I find
out what time Tortured Soul is playing then I will post that to make it easy

USA Today, front page, about a month ago.  Dunno; they're not exactly the
best source, and I may misremember, but I had the same thought, and
checked it about four times.  Either they misspoke, or record stores are
fucked.

Prog records are about a dime a dozen, now.  :)  And most of them suck
nuts.  Personally, I thought your last set I heard (Havana?) was good.
Then again, every once and awhile, I find myself listening to Oakenfold's
Essential Mix in Shanghai.

Varied taste, I suppose.  :)

Eh, and some of us just listen to a little of everything.

this isn't the first "CD killer" i've read about in the last couple 
years.  so far none have come to market.
i mean look at the minidisc?  recordable smaller, more durable.  almost 
noone makes em anymore, probably easier to find an 8-track player!

the correct phrase straight from his mouth: "detroits #1 dj"
but he lived there for a couple months before moving back home.  must

yeah, i see them there from time to time.  i had one 2 years ago or so, 
finding discs was sometimes hard, best buy usually had them, but there 
were times they didn't and i had to scour around for em.

Correct me if I am wrong but the mini-disc was compressed. It removed
any sound that couldn't "be heard" from the wave length before recording
it to the disc. Not that it matters but its not a 100%.

60 minutes tops (as I remember), more expensive to manufacture, and with
no major benefit after CD-R came out.

My bet is that physical media you take with you is the next thing to
become obsolete, 15-25 years from now.  Wireless has a good way it can
improve using existing technology, whereas media storage only has so much
farther to go without relying on technological breakthroughs.

i dont believe that will happen too soon. i think the next thing 
we're going to see is dvd audio discs becoming more popular. with 
home theatre systems selling so much, and with the ability to make 
anything that reads DVDs also read CD's, SACD's, etc, it just 
seems to make sense. standard size discs seem to be whats up, 
theyre the format for CDs, DVDs, most videogames, etc. how would 
current wireless technologies handle a streaming DVD at full 
quality? until it can do that, i bet DVD with backwards 
compatibility to CD will be standard.

they got em up to 80 minutes.  i liked em because you could put em into 
mono and get 160 minutes.  worked great for my 2+ hours a day i used to 
spend in the car.  one disk was good round trip.

well i've seen those bluetooth personal file servers mentioned.  a small 
hardrive and could be hooked up to other bluetooth stuff that could 
figure out how to access the files.  like headphones.... dunno if this

yes but sounded far far better than an mp3.  its called atrac 
compression.  a disc held i think 150 megs of data.  so they could get a 
4-5x compression off the 6-700 megs of wav data a cd held.
sony came out with additions to the atrac spec, too little too late, and 
i guess at higher levels of compression werent really all that good.

You can get a creative labs nomad for like 150 now, the most basic model

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} death of the compact disc???

Sounds great but I don't see where it can record. Does it have a line in
input on it? What kind of input it is it? Can I also jack a mic in for
dictation when in the car? If I could do that, play mp3's / wav and do a
line in record I would be very happy.

It looks like only the large bulky model can record.

You can get a creative labs nomad for like 150 now, the most basic model
has a 6 gig hard drive and you can record .wavs .. it is brilliant.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} death of the compact disc???


Yes the "large bulky model" I believe is the most basic model, the nomad
jukebox. it has a line in and you can even record at 48khz (dat quality)
rather than 44.1khz.  It is a 1/8" input.  It is about the size of your
standard discman.  I don't know if you can jack in a mic, for a mic, you'd
need a mic preamp and I know it doesnt have one of those in it.  It can
record wavs and playback wavs, and mp3s.  it connects to the PC with USB.
The quality is pretty damn good.  But to me, it is good for taking it with
me to all gigs and recording and seeing how the set sounded.  It would
never replace anything in the home, ie minidisc deck or pc, in terms of
recording.  But it has proven rock solid.  When technoir audio played at
flux, I recorded 5 hours of it and it sounded great.

www.nomadness.net -  is a site for nomad users, by nomad users and you can
find much more info there.

These people do insane things to their nomads, like hack the OS, etc.  The
jukebox has been around for at least 3-4 years now, it was basically one
of the first mass market mp3 players to have a hard drive built in and to
be relatively cheap.

absolutely, but you have that 80 minute cap.
moose has one that has a USB connection to a computer so you can pull it 
right off the disc, pretty nice.

also mp3 jukeboxes that can record, will do it up to the drive size.  
downside is it will be mp3.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} think pink

there is an exhibit tomorrow entitled "in the pink".  let's hope for something
special :)

i'll be peddling t-shirts in the milk music area on the 2nd floor (which is
looking pretty hot).  we'll probably stick around past 9 too.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} death of the compact disc???

i dono, i know bou the compression, but i still found
that mini disc was the most convenient/effective
portable recording method, and i've been using it for
like 2 yrs now.  my latest mix was originally recorded
on md. also you can amp up the levels in soundforge or
whatever if you so desire which won't undo the
compression, but still will make it sound alot better.
i tried an mp3 recorder, which records as .wav, but i
found it hard to use, unreliable, and it didn't record
from analogue source very well, or at least i couldn't
get it to.

umm....dish network has pay per view movies that are dvd quality and even 
have 5.1 sound(if your reciever can handle it)and thats a wireless 
technology....granted its not the most mobile of wireless technologies...but 
im sure they are working on it...they already have the infrastructure for 
it.

DVD audio is hot tho so is SACD...in the next few years...we are gonna see 
alot of this stuff...especially for music that needs to be in 5.1 or 7.1 for 
the full experience (pink floyd jumps to mind and classical)...the 
technology hasnt been pushed forward yet cuz most ppl dont have a dvd reader 
that can handle the DVDA and SACD spec yet...also, alot of mastering suites 
arent setup for it...MIX magazine(the real MIX not the crappy dj MIXMAG)has 
been touting this for 3 years now...and i think the studios are finally 
ready to start remastering stuff to release to DVDA and SACD

i have a sneaking feeling that the 5 big labels would love to re-release 
their entire catalogs on DVDA and SACD...they'd probably charge 30bux a disc 
too...i dont think there is a DVDA or SACD writer out yet for the consumer 
market...so they have at least 2 years to really push it before the whole 
piracy issue comes into play

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} death of the compact disc???

Time to flex the old brain muscles. I work on Video on Demand systems all
day, so I got a little insight. I took the day off tommorrow, and have
nothing to do tonight. Hardcore geek crap follows:

Currently, streaming a DVD wirelessly is to say the least, an engineering
nightmare. The average bit rate for "dvd quality" content is 3.5MBit a
second. At that bit rate, you can fit about 10 streams inside on normal 6
megahertz video channel (a standard broadcast channel is 6Mhz) at QAM256
(the modulation type that squeezes as much physical bandwidth as possible
out of a chunk of spectrum). You'd need a broadcast point density where
you'd be stepping on antennas or more frequncy allocation that is currently
available in the entire electromagnetic spectrum to viably stream to even a
small amount of customers.

It's a constant battle between transport and storage. Given the previously
stated constraints of transport, some sort of local storage is needed to
stage videos if you were to try and stream content on demand wirelessly,
think a "buffer" if you will. In this case, you're not really streaming as
much as providing a near streaming, or NVOD situation. It would appear as
though it's being streamed, but it would not be. Well kinda, follow.

If it were up to me, I'd take a 6Mhz chunk, take the 32MBit of bandwidth it
provides, and split it 4/4/1. Well, I'm not doing the real engineering math
here, so just bear with me. You'd take the first 4 segments (8 video
channels worth) and broadcast the first 15 minutes or so of a program to
every device, then the device would save that, and start that as your
stream. The next 4 channels would broadcast the next parts of all the videos
equally (in carousel fashion again, each title getting some time, then
moving on to the next), so once you started a stream, it would start
listening for header packets of the video you ordered (thus saving space
from downloading all movies), and arranging them at the end of the local
MPEG that was already staged on your box, thus extending your movie. The
only problem with this is that is that you couldn't start a movie and
instantly fast forward to the middle of it, because you just don't have it
yet. The last one channel would be saved for situations where you would
stream a non-popular title to one customer. If anyone else on that serving
group wanted to view a movie, they'd be SOL and get a busy signal. However,
the fact of the matter is that most customers will view the most popular
titles most of the time and it kinda works out that way anyway.

This works excellently for cellular systems, but as far as satellite goes,
you'd need an inordinate amount of downstream bandwidth to make it appear as
though the movie is really being streamed. So much in fact, that it actually
works out that it's just as effective to start the movie every half hour in
a linear fashion, and record it tivo stylee. You COULD just take 10 channels
of regular pay per view, and constantly stream titles to customers having
them stage entire movies at once, but they'd need a really large amount of
local storage for that to work. The math comes out to 3.1GB per 120min
movie, which really isn't too bad, but if you want to compete with cable,
you're going to need a few terabytes of local storage, thus exceeding your
transport capabilites and average consumer pocketbook.

word.

If they come only from "virgin forests" then they should be boycotted.
Violoins are a luxury and there is no need to rip apart a stable habitat
for that type of luxury.  OH NO...my violin might not play as well if it's
not VIRGIN WOOD.. blaughh..

from ana in brazil

Our emotional state of choice is Ecstasy. Our nourishment of choice
is Love. Our addiction of choice is technology. Our religion of
choice is music. Our currency of choice is knowledge. Our politics
of choice is none. Our society of choice is utopian though we know
it will never be.

You may hate us. You may dismiss us. You may misunderstand us. You
may be unaware of our existence. We can only hope you do not care to
judge us, because we would never judge you. We are not criminals. We
are not disillusioned. We are not drug addicts. We are not naive
children. We are one massive, global, tribal village that transcends
man-made law, physical geography, and time itself.

We were first drawn by the sound. From far away, the hunderous,
muffled, echoing beat was comparable to a mother's heart soothing a
child in her womb of concrete, steel, and electrical wiring. We were
drawn back into this womb, and there, in the heat, dampness, and
darkness of it, we came to accept that we are all equal. Not only to
the darkness, and to ourselves, but to the very music slamming into
us and passing through our souls: we are all equal. And somewhere
around 35Hz we could feel the hand of God at our backs, pushing us
forward, pushing us to push ourselves to strengthen our minds, our
bodies, and our spirits. Pushing us to turn to the person beside us
to join hands and uplift them by sharing the uncontrollable joy we
felt from creating this magical bubble that can, for one evening,
protect us from the horrors, atrocities, and pollution of the
outside world. It is in that very instant, with these initial
realizations that each of us was truly born.

We continue to pack our bodies into clubs, or warehouses, or
buildings you've abandoned and left for naught, and we bring life to
them for one night. Strong, throbbing, vibrant life in it's purest,
most intense, most hedonistic form. In these makeshift spaces, we
seek to shed ourselves of the burden of uncertainty for a future you
have been unable to stabilize and secure for us. We seek to
relinquish our inhibitions, and free ourselves from the shackles and
restraints you've put on us for your own peace of mind. We seek to
re-write the programming that you have tried to indoctrinate us with
since the moment we were born. Programming that tells us to hate,
that tells us to judge, that tells us to stuff ourselves into the
nearest and most convenient pigeon hole possible. Programming that
even tells us to climb ladders for you, jump through hoops, and run
through mazes and on hamster wheels. Programming that tells us to
eat from the shiny silver spoon you are trying to feed us with,
instead of nourish ourselves with our own capable hands. Programming
that tells us to close our minds, instead of open them.

Until the sun rises to burn our eyes by revealing the distopian
reality of a world you've created for us, we dance fiercely with our
brothers and sisters in celebration of our life, of our culture, and
of the values we believe in: Peace, Love, Freedom, Tolerance, Unity,
Harmony, Expression, Responsibility and Respect.

Our enemy of choice is ignorance. Our weapon of choice is
information. Our crime of choice is breaking and challenging
whatever laws you feel you need to put in place to stop us from
celebrating our existence. But know that while you may shut down any
given party, on any given night, in any given city, in any given
country or continent on this beautiful planet, you can never shut
down the entire party. You don't have access to that switch, no
matter what you may think. The music will never stop. The heartbeat
will never fade.

The party will never end.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootchs can afford stradivarius

This is a moot point.  stradivarius was a violin maker
in the 18th (i believe) century.  His violins have
been copied (poorly in many cases) a lot but there is
no such thing as a 'new' stradivarius violin because
the guy's been dead for centuries.  BTW I don't
believe _anyone_ has been able to produce a modern
violin that equals the tone quality of a stradivarius,
despite the use of every technique known to instrument
makers.  Whether its virgin wood, some odd curing
process for the wood, or the guy sold his soul to
satan I don't believe anyone's been able to match a
stradivarius violin...that's why they're so well
known, not to mention expensive.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} death of the compact disc???


I used (and liked!) my minidisc player until someone stole it.  I'm not
willing to pay for a new one; I bought the first one used.  My next
hardware is definitely an iPod; just trying to debate between 10, 20 or
40.

It's got a couple years, but it'll get there.

A dvd is <3 gigs; maybe a two hour movie.  Wireless-G is the current
standard, at 54Mbps, or a maximum speed of about 7 megs a second, 420 megs
a minute, or 48 gigs in two hours.  If I got the math right.  So current
wireless, running at 1/10th of it's maximum capacity, can do full quality
streaming DVD.  Problem isn't so much the speed of the technology, but the
range.

I'm guessing you're right on about DVD-audio; I wasn't even thinking about
those.  I'm thinking that in a few years, when there are more devices that
use wireless networks, places like Eat 'n Park, Kennywood, Giant Eagle,
and others will have wireless access points set up.  At a certain point,
when bandwidth is cheap enough *and* you can access it from anywhere, I'm
expecting DVD-audio (or CD, or that memory-cube thing from the link) to
fall out of favor, and streaming to be the new 'media'.

Don't get the 10, it has no goodies that come with it. The extra $100 the 20
costs gets you a dock, the pc adapter, a remote and a case, which add up to
more than $100. The dock is uber useful for like keeping on your desk at
work or something and the remote is absolutely needed if you want to say
ride a bike or something.

OT: Traktor 2.51 is a peice of dung.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootchs can afford stradivarius

Acctuall its the protoype for the moddern fiddle. But your right, noone has
been able to repoduce the quality or tonality of a Strad. I played violin
for 6 years or so, and I knew some girl who's dad had a Strad. I didn?t seem
to care then. I still don't.

Subject: {pb-cle} History of underground dance...

This morning someone posted a link to this movie on another site:
http://www.maestro-documentary.com/

It seems to portray dance music as it is - from its roots in disco to
present day.  I wanted to bring this up when we were talking about disco
again the other day.

I made the comment that "It's all just disco" or "It's just the disco biz"
or "It's the disco game".   As I have said countless times... disco had an
underground side.   Village People and Donna Summer were to disco as DJ
Sammy or Ian Van Dahl are to EDM or Techno.  Disco "died" because the
mainstream pronounced it a fad that had to go... much in the way Emenim said
"nobody listens to techno".

I know I have said these things over and over I just wanted to say it again.
I'm thinking that we are living in an age where "rave" and "techno" (and all
the terms associated with it) have served their purpose and its now time to
move forward.

Just some ramblings... check out the website and the trailer.  It looks very
good.

EDM doesnt need to have a large following.  Disco didn't need a 
following.  It's not something new to do like a fad, or a status 
symbol.  It's a way of life.  Some people are jealous of the way 
of life affecting others so they try to put it in a can so that 
others can enjoy it.  These are the "sell-outs" that do things for 
the wrong reasons.  It's not for everyone.  Everyone doesnt have 
the capacity to embrace it in the manner that we all have found.  
We promote for the sole purpose of trying to educate those around 
us in hopes they may find a reason to embrace it or experience why 
we find it so enjoyable.  

That wasn't really a debate or anything, just a statement I felt 
like saying.  I think it also speaks loudly upon why some are 
thought to be sell outs vs keeping it real.  There is no 
underground, it's just a smaller cross section of society that has 
found EDM as a way of life.  There is no mainstream EDM, because 
you can't package the passion, you can't package what we feel for 
the music, that has to be learned and experienced on different 
levels for different people.  It's all just disco... It's all just 
punk.  It's all just a subculture way of life that the mainstream 
will never be able to package the true meaning (for any of the 3).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} History of underground dance...

The reason I brought this up was in the interest of progression.  So many
people who are part of EDM seem to grasp onto the past instead of the
present or future.  The who "sell-out" argument is often used mistaken.
People called Depeche Mode (as early as music for the masses) sell-out.  It
is a phenomena that happens whenever someone makes it big --- and a true fan
doesn't need to use that word.  The people who use the term "sell-out" in
that case were people who held their "underground ideals" sacred over the
music.

I digress... people pine for the days of old -- and while I always bring up
the past it is only so that we might learn from it.  Reliving the past is
not forward moving.   I guess I never seperated the
"progressive/alternative" scene from the "rave scene" becuase I grew up
through it and assumed they went hand in hand.   In the same way that
"gothic/industrial" peeps get stuck STILL listening to the same old anthems
from the 1980s... or so many ravers still to be stuck on speed garage (an
irrelevant term left over from 1994) or any other form of antiquated
progression, it leads me to believe that something is stuck.  I held higher
standards for "rave" mentality.  While gothic/industrial is still
underground... the underground I hold sacred is progressive in nature.
Always moving forward and looking back only to learn from our mistakes.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootchs can afford stradivarius

real stradivarius are still made to this day...they are made by the selmer
company...they bought out the stradivarius shop in the 50s i
believe...stradivarius makes fewer than 500 violins a year...and a mercedes
600 is cheaper than a stradivarius

mmmkay?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootchs can afford stradivarius

Once again, strad is the basic model of the modern violin. Its like the
standard, that is primarily used today...say a car with a steering wheel
instead of a joystick. It's more practical. Just cuz the company is still
around don?t mean shite.

A REAL strad is one that is considered to be made by the ORIGINAL Nicola
Stradivarius, or whatever his name was. THAT?S why they are expensive.

The guy's name was Antonio Stradivari.  he made about
1100 instruments in his lifetime of which about 650
are known to still exist.  These are the 'True'
Stradivarius instruments that command huge prices.

This might actually make me want to go to

Torah Raves Mix Kabbala and Psychedelia for a San Francisco Sound 

By ANYA KAMENETZ 
What do Lubavitcher chasidim, Sufi whirling dervishes and pierced, 
dreadlocked youths have in common? The secret to joy, at least 
according to Yehudit Steinberg of Berkeley, Calf., a DJ, teacher of 
meditation and self-styled originator of the "Torah rave."

Torah raves, according to Ms. Steinberg, turn the electronic music, 
communal feeling and wild dancing of the drug-laden rave culture to 
a religious purpose. "Basically, I would call it a techno-ritual," 
Ms. Steinberg said, gesturing with both hands as she sped across the 
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in a silver 

Ford Taurus toward Cellspace, an artists' collective in downtown San 
Francisco. "It's music and rhythm connected with a journey." 

The media loves to chronicle the nocturnal habits of ravers, who 
gather in abandoned warehouses or open fields to dance the night 
away in a haze of techno music, psychedelics and "Peace, Love, Unity 
and Respect" (PLUR, a slogan of the movement). Ms. Steinberg's dance 
parties fuse elements of the rave culture with an interpretation of 
kabbala, Jewish mysticism.

Ms. Steinberg produces her Torah raves in and around San Francisco 
at Jewish Renewal centers and conferences, yoga studios and other 
venues. Some are fund raisers for religious schools or synagogues, 
and some are independent. Admission usually costs between $10 and 
$15, and the events are publicized in the manner of standard raves  
by e-mail, fliers and word-of-mouth  both within and outside the 
Jewish Renewal community.

Ms. Steinberg, 51, cuts an earth-motheresque figure in a long 
flowing dress and head scarf, and indeed, her interest in what she 
calls "the mind-body-soul connection" began in the 1970s. She 
wandered through many disciplines, from yoga and tai chi to Hinduism 
and Christianity to the metaphysical Theosophy and Science of Mind, 
before reconnecting to Judaism through the Jewish Renewal community 
in Northern California. 

She discovered a "safe space for emotions" through a study of 
niggunim, wordless chasidic songs. "I would sing these at home alone 
and just laugh and cry," she said. "I remember my husband coming 
home when I was into that, and he would say, 'Oh my God, what's 
wrong with you?" The Torah raves are an outgrowth of her involvement 
with the Renewal movement, which draws its inspiration from 
chasidism and new-age spirituality.

Unlike a regular rave, marked by chaos, crowds and the stylings of 
individual DJs, according to Ms. Steinberg, the Torah rave 
experience is more overtly spiritual and structured. "My intention 
is for people to achieve joy and then tranquility." At a Torah 
rave, "guide" dancers lead 30 to 300 participants through a 
progression of movements, from stretches to wild twirling and 
leaping, based on the kabbalistic scheme of Four Worlds  assiyah 
(associated with earth), yetzirah (water), briah (air) and atzilut 
(fire). The atmosphere is enhanced with dim club lighting, pulsating 
electronic world-beat music and psychedelic visuals. 

Small tables called "altars," with arrangements of pictures, flowers 
and decorative objects, complete the space.

"There were beautiful images, candles, really nice videos, an 
incredible slide show," a participant, Zak Zaidman, said. "All the 
images were connected. You were dancing, listening to music, looking 
at the pictures." 

But the Torah raves aren't resonating with everybody. Seth Brysk, 
program director of the San Francisco Hillel, said that he sees 
Torah raves "as an interesting gimmick to attract people to Torah 
study and spirituality" and that they are like "a social event, but 
within a Jewish context." 

Charges of practicing "pop kabbala" have been leveled at Ms. 
Steinberg on online Jewish discussion boards. "Let's be clear. You 
cannot practice kabbala without a lifetime of learning. 
The 'kabbala' that people claim to be using at things like these 
raves," said Rabbi Alan Lew, who runs a meditation center next to 
his Conservative Congregation Beth Shalom in San Francisco. "It's 
dishonest. Flim-flam."

Ms. Steinberg and other Torah ravers concede that what is possible 
in their "eclectic, spiritual" Bay Area crowd may be beyond the pale 
of most mainstream Jews' experience. Yet they argue that such dance, 
communal ritual and unbridled joy is strongly rooted in Jewish 
tradition. "I think that what I'm doing is really in line with what 
Jews have done for centuries," Ms. Steinberg said. 

She doesn't see much value in the traditional, esoteric, protected 
nature of kabbala study. "To me, it's obvious that what the kabbala 
attempts to talk about is the creative process  how you take a 
thought and bring it into form," she said. "There's a way of 
experiencing the world and spirit and our inner state that does not 
get captured in words," Mr. Zaidman said. "The holy can be 
encountered directly, body to soul. The chasidim used to do that, 
and that's what we're reconnecting with."

Cia Sautter, who teaches world religion at the Union Theological 
Seminary in Minneapolis, also sees ancient connections in the Torah 
rave. She has worked on the raves as an organizer and guide dancer. 
She puts Torah raves on the "softer" end of a range of ecstatic 
dance and trance experiences from Islam, Hinduism, Vodoun and Native 
American religions.

"Ecstasy comes from the Greek ex-stasis, meaning to go beyond 
yourself. It could leave you in a trance experience where you don't 
know what's going on around you," Ms. Sautter said. "What Yehudit is 
attempting to do in the raves is to get people comfortable letting 
go."

Some might accuse Torah ravers of spiritual tourism, borrowing from 
both current music trends and any convenient spiritual tradition. 
The sounds of a Torah rave are indeed multicultural  African, 
Indian, Caribbean, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and Native American 
drumming and chanting, mixed with electronic beats and noises. But 
just as the past few years have brought meditation from the ashram 
to the synagogue, Torah ravers see themselves as reviving and 
celebrating Jewish forms of movement, from shuckling to the hora.

"I think that post-Israel, post-1948, the idea of [Jewish] dance is 
not so strange to people, because they grew up with Israeli dance," 
Ms. Sautter said. "It has to do with the rediscovery of Judaism as a 
holistic concept."

But the line between rediscovery and misappropriation seems rather 
fluid, as even the party-kid, Ecstasy-fueled "mainstream" rave scene 
commonly portrayed in the media references kabbalistic concepts. 
This is particularly true of the offshoot known as psychedelic 
trance, or psy-trance, which draws heavily on Eastern spiritual 
imagery. The New York-based Devotional Ministry of Trance bears 
philosophical similarities to the Torah rave movement while 
participating in an underground psychedelic drug culture. "We 
believe in spiritual enlightenment through trance music," reads its 
online "creed." "Services bring together a diverse cross-section of 
the trance, dance and spiritual communities." 

As a flyer for an event last year announced, "Tonight we explore the 
KABBALAH through trance dance ritual."

well sure there's less poppy stuff, but the record labels grab
onto what they seem to think they can profit from. and they like
those pretty white faces (not counting opus) and unchallenging
format of songs.

the thing is, imagine someone decided to have the pop star
mentality by spinning drum and bass. it wouldnt work. what would
you do, grow a mullet, start talking about dungeons and dragons
and pretend youre heavy metal now? oh wait.

thats this city. and it still is more popular than just about
everything else. go measure the attendance at the oakenpoop show
and compare it to the number of people who will show up for bugz
in the attic. it wont even be close. 

>Why buy machines when you can use software and a midi controller?
They are 
>easily the most popular forms of making EDM nowadays...

sure, but unless youre stealing your stuff, it still costs lots of
dough to put together an all software studio, as well as paying
for all the high end computer hardware. dual CPU macs + a protools
interface and program is no joke, youre looking at like $5000 and
up depending on how intricate you go. 

>Just because you produce for a certain genre doesn't limit you to

try finding a hard techno or a drum and bass record that isnt
heavily compressed. basically, if you want to produce certain
genres you have to live up to certain levels of technical
proficiency. otherwise you just get laughed at. it is pretty silly
to think of, but if someone took the equipment that the first
jungle records were made with and tried to put out a record today,
theyd be laughed at like they were some jokers. i wont lie, i do
have some extra love for the styles of music that using old beat
up shit doesnt put you out of contention for making a top tune,
but i think the whole corporate music mentality has invaded dance
music both in consumption (prog) and in production (new expensive
synths). its all part of the same downward spiral.

theres a poster of roni size (i forget what its an ad for, some
clothing company. he has invisible arms in it) but he's sitting
there with an mpc2000xl. which is a $1000 machine that EVERYONE
uses these days. then theres a poster for his artist album, and on
it hes holding his sp-1200, an old 10 second sampling time piece
of shit sampler that he actually still uses sometimes. its just so
ingrained in there that no one notices these little things.

>its just the natural progression of technology...if they can put more

dig...they are
>gonna do it...

the thing is, why are the people digging it? im willing to bet
that 99% of the people who buy these synths with the silly specs
arent ever maxing them out. but they market it like everyone needs
it so they can charge $2000+ for their new shit. that new nord
micromodular actually looks pretty cool, but $2100? id rather get
an arp 2600 semi modular mono. that shit is silly. 

>some sounds do require polyphony...like the moving pads and

sounds on a mono

ppl that are

you a dope
>deal on an original DX-7 you'd take it...or any other classic
poly synth for
>that matter.

this has nothing to do with just polyphony. alot of good poly
synths were made in the late 70s to early 80s. then the DX series
came out, which is fine and good, but the synth makers then
suddenly pushed the "analogue is bad, everyone needs digital"
thing, and analogues basically disappeared for a while. and i dont
mind the DX series so much anyway, i have a tx81z and i love it.
the idea here is that stuff that is perfectly good for making good
music turns "old" when any given company decides it needs more money. 

>that may be true to an extent...but instrument makers are in
business to
>make money...they know that big time pop studios will buy into
any new
>technology and rape the presets as soon as it comes to market..

see, maybe im an idiot, but id like to think that if you made
really good equipment and spent lots of time making it better and
better, people would appreciate it. you look at the new minimoog,
and its an expansion of a 30 year old synth, but its not anything
like the new VAs people put out. and people buy the moog because
of the quality. its a good instrument. these VAs come out once
every 3 years or so, and alot of the companies quit updating their
OS when the new one goes into production (access is a big
exception there). theyre producing cheap shit to make money
instead of making cool new instruments that actually could be used
to make different stuff. 

>there is a whole other side to the coin too....vintage
craze...everybody and
>their brother is putting out "vintage" products....hell manley
and avalon
>make millions of dollars a year selling 60 year old technology!
alot of this
>reissue stuff probably wont even make it 5 years before it craps
out...but
>thats a whole other topic.

it is part of the same topic in a way though. if they put out good
products now, it would be worth it for people to spend the cash.
the reason theres been such a vintage craze is because people
recognize that older stuff was in alot of ways superior to the
crap people have been pushing to make $$$ for the past 25 years or
so especially. 

>in the end it comes down to this....instruments are just
tools...its all in
>how they are used...the best producers use everything availible
to them...to
>say new technology is worthless is really an ignorant comment to
make.

obviously there have been some really good advances that are great
especially at the consumer level. multitrack recording on PCs is
so great, i cant even begin to think about the possible results of
this 10 years from now. its funny, you could easily have more
advanced recording equipment in your bedroom than the beatles had
avaliable to them, but you dont see too many people as great as
the beatles rolling out with great songs do you? i think part of
this is that music making equipment has become kind of like a dick
measuring contest. everyone wants to have that new expensive shit,
even if they dont do shit with it.

if it wasnt for the fact that this is all done on software, i
might not mind so much. but its like nowadays instead of paying
for a real synth that you can think of in terms of costing X
amounts of dollars per oscillator, filter, etc, youre paying for
something that looks EXACTLY like the last one you bought except
now has better software or one better chip and now will cost you
another $2000 to get it. i dont know what the profitability of the
synth manufacturers is, but they really make it as expensive as
possible to want to own the new stuff that magazines say you
"NEED" to have.

this is a good point, but now thta my studio is essentially
complete im more concerned about other people making good music
instead of "well produced" music.

didnt look at your link, but here's an invaluable site: 

http://www.jahsonic.com/

especially the disco and dance sections, though overall it is just
a great site. and of course the book "last night a DJ saved my
life" should be read by everybody. not just disco/dance related,
but it shows how it all came together and then spread into house
and techno and hiphop.

My Buffet clarinet is made out of some endangered wood (rosewood, maybe? I
forget). Sucks that everyone who plays clarinet and is any good is just
*expected* to have a Buffet ...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootchs can afford stradivarius

stradivarius opened shops in vienna and nyc if im not mistaken...so an 
original stradivarius couldve been made by any number of craftsmen...when 
selmer bought stradivarius out...they kept the craftsman on to keep building 
violins and other instruments at the same quality for which stradivarius was 
known for.

the stradivarius shop in nyc also builds brass instruments

goto a cleveland orchestra concert...i garuntee you most of the stringed 
instruments are stradivarius...some were made before the buyout...some 
after...same thing with the brass section....the reason stradivarius 
instruments are sought after by professionals is the high quality of the 
build and the tone of the instrument.

the shape of the violin has been unchanged for probably 600 years of 
more...stradivarius came along in the 1700s i believe.

i take back what i said about the shop in veina, it was in fact in italy...i 
know for a fact there is a stradivarius workshop in nyc...that is where the 
majority of their brass instruments are made.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootch!

let the record show 90% of dnb these days is produced completey inside of 
software with software instruments and software effects...most producers are 
selling off their gear as they realise its just plain faster and easier to 
produce in software....if you have already multisampled all your kit...why 
have it collect dust when some idiot thinks they just have to have a virus 
or a triton or a jp8000? and is willing to pay you for it...you'll usually 
get 200 less than what u paid anyways.

the mainstream culture didnt invade dnb...dnb has been about technicality 
and progression from day 1...if u dont believe this you are lying to 
yourself...new synths come out that make new sounds...creative producers 
will use every tool availible to them...so if that toolbox includes 
polysynths and better samplers than your beloved sp1200, deal with it...what 
remarc was doing in 94 was great...what rob was doing in 95 was 
great...timeless wouldve never been what it was if there werent 16bit/44k 
samplers availble...but the sound has evolved to include new tools...alot of 
tunes suck this is true...but there is plenty of good to...even tunes that 
suck usually have something cool about them, at least 1 sound nobody has 
ever used or some new processing trick...take japan by dillinja...generally 
regarded as shit...but thats the tune where dillinja realised the power of 
the bit crusher...shitty tune, but a good technique was discovered.

protools blows for dance music unless u are using nothing but hardware and 
still have a logic or cubase machine to run the midi side of things and can 
afford the hardware...free protools has always been a joke.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootchs can afford stradivarius

i think strads and other high end violins are made out of rosewood as 
well...rosewood has very good acustic properties...as does birtch and 
mahogony

rosewood trees are endangered...but in this country...to the logging 
industry must replace 2 rosewood trees for every1 it cuts down

and again u can make lotsa instruments out of a good size tree

im a brass player by training, so i guess im more environmentally pc than u

utter rubbish 
 
dance music has been around before disco as well. in many different forms. people who were called sophisticats or casuals would go out to clubs and listen to stuff like kraftwerk, warsaw, joy division, the normal, fad gadget, cabaret voltaire, etc etc etc. this was a german and brittish underground scene. while not as big as disco, this stuff still went on some time before disco and some time there after into the 80's. 
 
this same familiar scene also spawned many acts like depeche mode, soft cell, etc. etc.
 
and tekno and electro has been around before  disco with stuff like kraftwerk. kraftwerk created these forms of  music by using computers or their own created instruments. this is what they were famous for. when you listen to this sort of stuff, it is easy to hear. electriic cafe, computer world, boing boom chuck, trans europe express, metropolis. etc etc etc.     
and if you want real "disco" look no further than thhe kings, the highest selling act in this genre, the bee gees.

It seems to portray dance music as it is - from its roots in disco to
present day. I wanted to bring this up when we were talking about disco
again the other day.

I made the comment that "It's all just disco" or "It's just the disco biz"
or "It's the disco game". As I have said countless times... disco had an
underground side. Village People and Donna Summer were to disco as DJ
Sammy or Ian Van Dahl are to EDM or Techno. Disco "died" because the
mainstream pronounced it a fad that had to go... much in the way Emenim said
"nobody listens to techno".

I know I have said these things over and over I just wanted to say it again.
I'm thinking that we are living in an age where "rave" and "techno" (and all
the terms associated with it) have served their purpose and its now time to
move forward.

Just some ramblings... check out the website and the trailer. It looks very
good.

Did you bother to read what I wrote?  Bee gees were also the extreme pop
side of disco and BEGEE/SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was not real disco either.
TRANS EUROPE XPRESS was a soundtrack to breakdance culture wich came way
after disco as well.

Bud, you better check your history.  Everything you are referencing came
AFTER disco or in the point when it had already mutated into garage.

BTW... I don't dispute that there was dance music produced in other
countries at the time.  I also don't dispute that disco wasn't the first
music people danced to... certainly that is indeed obvious.

But Saturday Night Fever, BeeGees, Donna Summer, and STUDIO 54 are NOT the
type of things I am referring to when I speak of disco.  As I said those are
equivalent to anyone making pop records with a "techno" beat today.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rich Bioootch!


If people are going to make shitty music, it doesn't matter what gear or 
software they are using, there is no cure for that.  Sure it sucks when 
people make great tunes that aren't flawlessly engineered, but I'd take 
that over an engineering masterpiece that blows.

I'm going to throw this out there and say that I personally feel that 
it's white eastern europeans a la skc and paul b, etc with laptops that 
have helped suck the vibe out of dnb and made it into an engineering 
dick measuring contest.  I sort of liked it when the UK was runnin 
things.

But personally I do love the challenge of trying to produce some dnb 
cuts, being that the standards of production are decidedly quite hi-fi.  
But in the end, vsts or hardware, the question is, "does it sound 
good?"

Sure you can download all the warez you want and never pay for it and 
thus make your money back selling your gear off.  But tom has a point, 
if you were honest and paid for the shit you use, software can be quite 
up there.  How much does the software staple of soundforge or wavelab go 
for these days?

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} History of underground dance...

Either of you read "Keep on Dancin': My Life and the Paradise Garage" by Mel
Scheren.  It's been over a year since I did, a great read, very
historical--does a nice job following EDM here in the states, starting with
true disco.

<< dance music has been around before disco as well. in many different

post disco pal.
kraftwerk, by many disco dj's of the day, was referred to as "funky disco"
or "electro disco" and this comes out of their mouths.


<<< and tekno and electro has been around before  disco with stuff like
kraftwerk. kraftwerk created these forms of  music by using computers or
their own created instruments. this is what they were famous for. when you
listen to this sort of stuff, it is easy to hear. electriic cafe, computer

Did you bother to read what I wrote?  Bee gees were also the extreme pop
side of disco and BEGEE/SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was not real disco either.
TRANS EUROPE XPRESS was a soundtrack to breakdance culture wich came way
after disco as well.

Bud, you better check your history.  Everything you are referencing came
AFTER disco or in the point when it had already mutated into garage.

and some time there after into the 80's. 

dunno about "some time" before. sure kraftwerk existed pre disco 
era, but its not quite the same. considering when the proto disco 
stuff was coming out (philly soul type stuff, early to mid 70s) 
kraftwerk at that time were still decidedly more progressive rock 
sounding (i think autobahn was 73, still pretty rockish on that 
one.....). joy division definitely wasnt out pre-disco, ditto 
cabaret volatire. anyway, you really should read "last night a 
deejay saved my life". it breaks down pretty much every important 
deejay and dance music breakthrough up till acid house. 

>this same familiar scene also spawned many acts like depeche 
mode, soft cell, etc. etc.

those guys were all influenced by giorgio moroder, a disco 
producer from italy who lived in germany and made lots of classic 
disco tunes. 

>and tekno and electro has been around before  disco with stuff

dont know if its exactly techno or electro, but yeah they 
obviously had an influence. electro was still born from hiphop, 
and hiphop was born from disco and funk and soul.

We stocked the book @ the store for a while.

One saturday, just after we closed.  Two men wondered in.

It was Mel Cheren - who was in town visiting his friend Dennis who is still
a bartender @ Twist.

Mel, as you probably know from the book, was living in Cleveland before he
went back to NY to start West End.  Its nice to see West End returning to
their roots and dropping all the noise they have been making the last few
years.

DJs choose new paths as electronica goes back underground

By Jennie Dorris, For the Camera
November 14, 2003


It's a freezing cold night, and a Boulder Theater security guard weaves 
through the sparse crowd to peer at the flyer announcing the act for that 
night: Mark Farina.

"Who's that?" he asks.

"Some electronica guy, I think," says another worker.

Five years ago that question never would have been asked  Farina was a 
resident DJ at ultra-hip Boulder night spot Soma, and there were lines 
around the corner to see him. Since then electronic music has faded from 
the national spotlight, and Boulder reflected the trend with the closing of 
Soma last May.

The electronica scene isn't totally dead; Farina's Oct. 30 show sold more 
than 500 tickets out of a possible 1,000, and Boulder Theater publicist 
Lisa Lamun says the show probably would have sold out were it not the day 
before Halloween.

"The scene's still alive, it's just smaller and more underground," says 
Colin Chapman, a local DJ who showed up to see Farina spin. "It's a relief 
to have the scene back to people who are in it for the music."

The Next Big Thing

It was only five years ago that young record executives and writers at 
music magazines like Spin and Rolling Stone had a different take on things 
 they were busy creating the buzz that rock 'n' roll was dead.

It was the late '90s. Grunge had peaked, and boy bands were on the rise. 
But the crack in between the genres was big enough that the industry needed 
to step in and name the Next Big Thing.

Tomorrow's rock stars, they claimed, were the faceless DJs spinning records 
in warehouses and lofts. And the hype began. Moby was signed to Mute 
Records and Elektra Records on two separate contracts in 1991, and was on 
tour with Lollapalooza in 1995. Columbia took a chance on electronica 
producers Hardkiss. "X-Files" actress Gillian Anderson teamed with Virgin 
Records to lend her vocals to British techno group Hal in 1997. And Brit 
Paul Oakenfold celebrated in 1998 when he was voted "Best DJ in the World" 
by DJ magazine after the successful release of his first full-length album 
in the U.S. On MTV, videos by the Prodigy and Fatboy Slim were in heavy 
rotation.

The rise of electronica did more than make superstars out of the spinners. 
It brought the culture of the rave  the large, low jeans, glow sticks and 
candy accessories  into the mainstream. A subculture that had existed 
underground for more than 10 years became a playground for media attention 
and mainstream attendance.

But a look around at today's club scene reveals precious little of the 
electronica culture. Electronic music venues have closed, the baggy "rave 
pants" are out, and lines around a corner to a club comprise people hoping 
to catch one of their favorite Top 40 songs, not to hear creative mixing 
and sampling over a thumping bass beat.

Big in Boulder

No one would have seen it coming in the late '90s, when Boulder was not 
just following the national trends  it was setting records with small 
downtown nightclub Soma, which was attracting the top DJs  including DJ 
Greyboy, King Britt and Christopher Lawrence  at the height of the 
electronic movement. Another local club, Millennium, was turning 18-and- 
over clubgoers on to electronica around the same time, making Boulder 
arguably the hippest town between Chicago and Los Angeles.

"We decided to open up Soma not because of what was going on nationally, we 
just wanted that kind of establishment in this town. It was the kind of 
place we wanted to go to," says Hardy Kalisher, one of the club's former 
owners.

Soon after Soma opened in 1998 there were lines out the door nearly every 
night. Then DJ-culture bible URB magazine named Kalisher one of the 
nation's best club promoters. Then DJs from France and England were talking 
about the next time they would get to play Soma.

"People would come because they wanted to see DJs spin at Soma  it wasn't 
just Boulder, it became part of the national and international scene," says 
Kalisher, who still organizes local shows at clubs like The Church in 
Denver. And Soma was equally friendly to the local up-and-comers: "If you 
were a local DJ, you probably played Soma," Kalisher says.

Local performer Orange Peel Moses, editor of electronic music magazine 
Egen, was a Soma regular in 2000. "There would be a ridiculous line around 
the block for Soma's new hip-hop nights or for visiting DJs," he says.

At the national level, the scene still was growing quickly at the turn of 
the century, though signs of the slowdown were beginning to appear. Major 
record labels snatched up no-name DJs, but records weren't selling as 
successfully as they hoped. Dan Cohen, publicity director of the electronic 
label Astralwerks, was quoted in Wired Magazine saying, "There's a feeding 
frenzy for artists, and then only four of them will sell more than 300,000 
(copies). The bad side is that you're spending a lot of money on something 
that isn't necessarily going to make a lot of money." While the driving 
bass beats worked great in a club atmosphere, the music wasn't necessarily 
what people wanted to buy to listen to at home or in their cars.

But low record sales weren't going to sink the scene. Money still was 
coming in from tours and parties, which were expanding rapidly. Promoters 
who were used to putting on parties in warehouses now rented venues like 
the Denver Coliseum for raves.

But as the rave culture grew in numbers, the club drug ecstasy also was 
growing more popular. And when the death toll reached 15 for ecstasy- 
related deaths across the United States in 2001, the media went into a 
frenzy linking electronica and drug use. In Boulder County, 16-year-old 
Monarch High School student Brittney Chambers died of water intoxication in 
2001, after taking ecstasy. The incident wasn't club-related, but it added 
to a growing perception that ecstasy  and by extension, the electronic 
music scene  was growing more dangerous.

"People started getting hurt, which is bound to happen when you put 
thousands of people in one place for a night. And there was always a stigma 
with the rave culture  it just took a few incidents before they clamped 
down," Kalisher says.

Beginning of the end

Most people in the scene agree that electronica's death knell was sounded 
with the passing of the RAVE (Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy) 
Act earlier this year. Introduced in June 2002 and sponsored by Sen. Joseph 
Biden, a Democrat from Delaware, and Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican 
from Iowa, the act stated that promoters and owners were liable for any 
drug-related activities on their premises, citing penalties of up to 20 
years in prison and fines of up to $500,000. Denver's annual electronica- 
fest Rave on the Rocks was renamed the "Global Dance Festival" by its new 
promoter, and it lost Denver radio station KTCL (93.3 FM) as a sponsor, the 
station's program director telling the Camera earlier this year it was 
"because of the recent nationwide legal crackdown on events involving 
electronic music."

Longtime DJ Farina agrees the RAVE Act had a lot to do with the end of the 
scene. "I think we had a lot of parents afraid that their kids were going 
to be overdosing on ecstasy. And we also had promoters that didn't want to 
deal with red tape," he said. "It's all a lot of bad press, but I hope 
promoters are willing to mutate a bit and that the scene will spring back."

As the raves and tours ground to a halt, the poor record sales caught up 
with DJs, and many were dropped from major labels. Earlier this year, Soma 
reflected the trends by quietly closing its doors, and after being touted 
as rock's latest superstars, suddenly DJs everywhere were out of a job.

"And the scene is pretty quiet," Kalisher says.

That's because DJs have gone one of two places. The DJs who wanted to keep 
the club gigs traded house for hip-hop. And the DJs who wanted to stay 
electronic went right back where they were before the whole scene exploded 
 underground.

Back to the warehouse

Tony Dematteo and Aaron Chutz run Harmonic Motion, a small record shop on 
the Hill that carries obscure vinyl records used by electronica DJs. It's 
also the place to go to get news on upcoming underground shows, which 
mainly are promoted through flyers, e-mails, and word of mouth.

"The clubs closing pushed everything back to a DIY (do-it-yourself) 
approach. It's all about the black-and-white flyer again," Dematteo says.

The warehouse parties are fairly frequent  while Boulder hosts one a month 
(usually at a different location each time), Denver hosts around three to 
four a week. Attendance generally ranges from 100 to 200 people. Chutz and 
Dematteo help keep the scene going by lending DJs equipment and helping set 
up and tear down speakers. The DJs themselves are fronting the cost for the 
warehouse  one of the few ways they can get a venue is to rent a space, 
make their own flyers, and absorb any extra costs. It's a far cry from the 
superstar image DJs enjoyed just a few years ago. But true electronica fans 
appreciate the more humble approach.

"DJs who have the whole rock-star image think they're doing something 
important. They need to have a reality check. I mean, they're playing other 
people's records," Chutz says.

And while the retreat of electronica into the underground takes a lot more 
work, Chutz and Dematteo appreciate the return of the scene to its roots. 
And so do its fans.

"Now it's all about the music," says Chapman. "Everybody in the scene is 
true to the music and we're finding the right crowd again."

The rise of hip-hop

As electronica's thumping bass beats retreated to the underground, hip-hop 
DJs embraced the genre's newfound popularity in Boulder and stepped up to 
mix up the tunes that are topping the charts nationally and are starting to 
be played at local bars. (Just walk past the Player's Club on the Hill on a 
Tuesday night to hear some Jay-Z and 50 Cent.)

The Fox Theatre is slowly turning into one of the country's premier hip-hop 
venues, regularly attracting huge crowds to see national artists such as 
Blackalicious, Snoop Dogg and members of the Wu Tang Clan.

"We've been doing hip-hop for a few years now, and the progression has been 
great. The younger kids totally dig it," says Fox assistant manager John 
Caprio.

DJ Petey (Petey Helm), a Boulder-based hip-hop DJ, spins five nights a 
week, four of those in Boulder. With a big following at the Foundry, he 
denies the notion that the death of raves brought the death of DJs.

"Even Soma closing didn't really affect me  there are definitely a lot of 
DJs out here and all of them want work, and this has always been the case. 
It's always been very competitive," Petey says.

With weekly nights devoted to hip-hop music at Boulder clubs the Attic, 
Round Midnight and the Players Club, the Boulder market is getting nothing 
but more friendly to DJs like Petey.

A.J. Sandoval, a bouncer at the Attic on its Thursday hip-hop night, says 
the event has gotten huge since its promotion earlier this fall. "I see the 
bling-bling-wearing white college kids, but I also see a lot of people 
coming up from Denver to hear the music," he says.

The Players Club now devotes two nights (Tuesday and Saturday) to hip-hop 
music. "Those are our most popular nights, they're really getting huge," 
says bartender Gillian Olson.

And the change from electronic to hip-hop doesn't mean the same DJs 
spinning different music  the change in genre brings in a whole new set of 
artists.

"Hip-hop is a different kind of DJing. Techno DJ producers would look for 
the rarest and best records and would actually mix at the club  they would 
probably say they were 'making music,'" Petey says. " (Hip-hop DJs) take 
existing albums and change them through scratching them  trying to make it 
something you've never heard before."

Hip-hop might be huge right now, but Petey knows his success might not last 
forever; after all, it was the death of the last genre that gave his 
success in DJing a rise.

"I think it'd be overconfident to say I'd survive anything that came my 
way," he says. "But I definitely work every hour of every day to try to be 
prepared."

okay post an article for this please. afterall you're the expert correct? prove me wrong big man. i love how genre nitwits like you always try to call decent music, "garage" or compare it to god aweful house music or the village people. who couldn't have been any more mainstream than the bee gees. *laugh*
 
 
>Did you bother to read what I wrote?
 
i tried hard not to laugh throughout most of your tirade i admit it. but you're vitriol is utterly laughable. 
 
>Bee gees were also the extreme pop side of disco 
 
everyone jumped on  the disco bandwagon and the village people were certainly not underground in the least bit. the point that can't be refuted is the bee gee's have the highest selling disco song of all time. staying aliive.  deal with it. 
 
>and BEGEE/SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was not real disco either.

of course it was. 
 
>TRANS EUROPE XPRESS was a soundtrack to breakdance culture wich came 
way after disco as well.

bahahaha you fool. trans europe express came out in early 1977. i'd hardly say that was later than disco considring disco didn't take off til mid to late 77. 
 
And trans europe express was ELEKTRO culture period. so were the other german acts that tried to sound like kraftwerk. there's a great article about it in massive magazine with stuart wall. has interviews with these old style german elektro acts as well. so much history there. this was printed in 95 or 96 i believe.  break dancing was yet another fad like disco that pretty much came and went. yes africa bambata stole trans europe express like most of the black artists did back then. i hate to admit this to because i am black myself but you have to admit that kraftwerk were some crazy mother fr's. bambata stole or borrowd the european originators music and they tried to call it his own. but everyone knows the truth and who created what. i'd like to see stories about disco djs making their own instruments and composing purely synthetic musik like kraftwerk did. got any? hahahahaha or maybe you can show me how they were before kraftwerk and all. hahaha don't quit you're day job ya
 sissy. 
 
>Bud, you better check your history. 
 
i'm 37 bud. i know my history. you should know your role.
 
>Everything you are referencing came AFTER disco or in the point when it had already mutated into garage.
 
wrong, kraftwerk was around making electronic music many many years before disco had even started. same with cabaret voltaire and many other german elektro acts that molded their sound off kraftwerk..
 
and this crap about "mutated into garage" shows that you know nothing of what has been discussed earlier. such a typical lemming
 
you're quite the ebarassment "doug".

sad, truly sad.

Did you bother to read what I wrote? Bee gees were also the extreme pop
side of disco and BEGEE/SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was not real disco either.
TRANS EUROPE XPRESS was a soundtrack to breakdance culture wich came way

Bud, you better check your history. Everything you are referencing came
AFTER disco or in the point when it had already mutated into garage.

yes well electronic music had to get it's synthesized beat from somewhere and it was certainly found in kraftwerk long before disco had even started, doug.
 
of course if you'd like to name the disco songs that came before kraftwerk i'd love to have an mp3 listen of them. you'll do that for me, right dougy?

But Saturday Night Fever, BeeGees, Donna Summer, and STUDIO 54 are NOT the
type of things I am referring to when I speak of disco. As I said those are
equivalent to anyone making pop records with a "techno" beat today.

people who were called sophisticats or casuals would go out to clubs and
listen to stuff like kraftwerk, warsaw, joy division, the normal, fad
gadget, cabaret voltaire, etc etc etc. this was a german and brittish
underground scene. while not as big as disco, this stuff still went on some
time before disco and some time there after into the 80's.

>dunno about "some time" before. 
 
no, clearly you don't.
 
>considering when the proto disco stuff was coming out (philly soul type stuff, early to mid 70s) 
 
yes well, soul wasn't exactly tekno/electronic music now was it, no it wasn't. there were no synthetic 4x4 kick drums in soul music like there was in kraftwerks music. soul was more musical instruments and the occasional piano here and there ala the regressive side of music. kraftwerk were truly synthetic masters. long before disco. 
 
>kraftwerk at that time were still decidedly more progressive rock 
 
incorrect, kraftwerk's progreessive and electronic side was under the guise of their other name, "the organization" which was 1969-1970.
 
>sounding (i think autobahn was 73, still pretty rockish on that one.....).
 
oh yes, real rockish there. it was purely a synthetic track. no guitars, no rock influence at all. this is how i know i'm dealing with a little kid. the little kid says big things but then fails to understand who the creatros are and simple incorrect things about a song that was litterally one of the most infleuntial in electronic musik.   you failed, son. F- 
 
>joy division definitely wasnt out pre-disco
 
no not pre-disco but "warsaw" was around the same time. joy division was simply an extension of warsaw and also part of the later, casualist dance scene. 
 
>ditto cabaret volatire.
 
incorrect, cabaret voltaire were making musik in 1974 which easilly predates disco. *yawn*
 
 
 
 >anyway, you really should read "last night a  deejay saved my life". it breaks down pretty much every important deejay and dance music breakthrough up till acid house. 

i don't need to read about it. i lived it. 

>those guys were all influenced by giorgio moroder, a disco 
producer from italy who lived in germany and made lots of classic 
disco tunes. 
 
no, they weren't influence by giorrgio(who isn't sh!t btw. i considr people like Ivan Ivan who spun at the pyramid in nyc, among others, to be far more of a respectable and knowledgable individual. but then again he did spin real electronic roots influenced stuff, not watered down disco crap)  they were influenced by the casuals scene.  they also got a later stigma of "new romantic" sound but this was inacurate. if you've heard the song, "no disco", you would know that Their true influence was stuff like kraftwerk, the normal and so on. the normal's own daniel miller taught most of them how to play their keyboards. he specifically taught alan wilder how to play the instruments. he has heavilly influenced them in their early direction and you're free to go to depehcemode.com and ask the mod their if you're still in disbelief. 

>electro was still born from hiphop, and hiphop was born from disco and funk and soul. 
  
bloody fool!! elektro was born and rooted from kraftwerk's trans europe express among others by them. again, this tells me you do not know what you're talking about and haven't read what i've explained.  hip hop wasn't even alive when kraftwerk had put out this mastrpiece. i could go to earlier kraftwerk releases and find elektro as well. they truly were amazing artists.  
 
>so youre not just stupid, but ignorant as well. 
 
Vitriolic diatribes show an unrefined or uncivilized disposition - not that of an intelligent person. Beasts tend to try intimidate with all their might to make up for their lack of mental acuity.  The basis for all meaningfull communication is "respect". The Intelligent person has honour, respect and is a noble being.  You wallow in the baser aspects of Schopenhauer's human motivators namely "malice".  However your invocation of "malice" is that of a lower goon it would seem to me. In an intelligent society one must transcend the baser instincts of malice and self interest for the people. Without this there can be no intelligent civilization. You do not even begin to exemplify the aspects of an Intelligent individual.  The modus operandi of the true thinker in this situation is to bestow and enlighten knewledge upon those around them for the betterment of the group.

 
Btw I believe "youre" was misspelled.
 
you've got some learning to. 
get to work.(i'm saying this one nicely)

another funny little thing about disco. if it was so frickin great then why didn't the fad continue eh? 
 
at least with techno we know it was rooted kraftwerk and continued on through the late 70's with artists like the normal, fad gadget and into the early 80's with depeche(big muff, photographic, etc) fad gadget(lady shave etc), new order, front 242(body to body), among the numerous synth techno acts.
 
then of course we come to "detroit" techno and people like derrick may talking about his huge influences on the bbc special called "the perfect beat", where he says, "i had mother fu*kin depeche mode on my floor, new order, people wanted to know what the f...k this stuff was i was lisening to". 
 
okay, german techno, robotiko rejecto(87' technodrome int. germany) rave era techno, belgian hard beat, lords of acid, ala 88'.i sit on acid. yadda yadda yadda.
 
trance-techno, the mid 90s minimal stuff. hardcore, the continued prescene in stuff like electro clash(williamsburg, dj hell from germany) tekno-wave, tekno-eletro, the rebirth of tekno industrial(see oliver chesler, hypnotizer, covenant(dead stars) hardbeat tekno the nu-nrg mutation etc etc.
 
it f.....g goes on like clockwork. 
 
if i had a choice i'd pick the genre that built manyy excellent sub-genres, gave birth to an exciting scene, then continued to mutate into something greater than that, to where we still hear it's beat and sounds today. 
 
in short, i'll pass on the donna summer remixes that ol giorgio did and look to the true creators of the early 70s and their counterparts in the 80's. 
 
good day

<<<don't quit you're day job!>>>
This is my day job.  You are quite the joke.  You don't bother to read what
is written.  You put "UK" in your name when you live in Chicago.   You don't
even bother to read what is written, you only ramble to server your own ego.

I have said repeatedly that I am NOT talking about bee gees, village people,
donna summer, and the like.  So quit speaking on a moot point.  Don't pull
age card with me, son.

Don't speak about garage when it is evident you know nothing about it.  The
term garage was coined in NYC somewhere between 1977-1987 in reference to
the music played by Larry Levan at The Paradise Garage.  GARAGE was
synonymous with house music from that point until the mid 90's and if you
really lived up to your "UK" title you would know that as fact.    Genre
nitwit indeed.


<<<another funny little thing about disco. if it was so frickin great then
why didn't the fad continue eh? >>>

The fad was Saturday night Fever and such.   It was clear that legitimate
artists had to distance themselves from that pateantry.  Disco Duck, Village
People, etc... yes... rubbish.   The music here was not the fad.


<< i'd like to see stories about disco djs making their own instruments and
composing purely synthetic musik like kraftwerk did. got any? hahahahaha >>

Why do you spell music with a k?  Are you simply just a troll? Synthetic
(not real) music indeed..  Disco artists, in the begin, were primarily
bands.  Salsoul Orchestra.   One of the more mainstream examples that will
put a date on things for you... "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone - The Temptations
(Gordy, 1972) "   I would hope you don't need an mp3 for that.  You would do
well to read up on things or actually talk to people who were there -- I do.

As for name calling an the like.... please heed the advice you gave Tom.
Embarrasement.. hah... keep typing.  Come back when you can have a civil
conversation.

pretty much came and went. yes africa bambata stole trans europe express

crazy mother fr's. bambata stole or borrowd the european originators music
and they tried to call it his own. but everyone knows the truth and who
created what. i'd like to see stories about disco djs making their own

I heaard it on Fatboy Slim's "Live From The Boutique" (?) mix CD...  It is

---------- Original Message ----------------------------------
From: chaos uk <bigmuff80s@yahoo.com>

>okay post an article for this please. 

ive seen this comment as well, hes not just making it up. not sure
where it was, but it was made.....

>i love how genre nitwits like you always try to call decent
music, "garage" or compare it to god aweful house music or the
village people. who couldn't have been any more mainstream than
the bee gees. *laugh*

um, yeah/ 

>everyone jumped on  the disco bandwagon and the village people
were certainly not underground in the least bit. the point that
can't be refuted is the bee gee's have the highest selling disco
song of all time. staying aliive.  deal with it. 

what do sales have to do with quality of music? by that logic,
fatboy slim is much more representative of electronic music
because he sold more copies than your beloved kraftwerk. 

>>and BEGEE/SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was not real disco either.
>
>of course it was. 

yeah.

>bahahaha you fool. trans europe express came out in early 1977.
i'd hardly say that was later than disco considring disco didn't
take off til mid to late 77. 

where are you pulling this date from? youre just making it up,
basically. 

>And trans europe express was ELEKTRO culture period. so were the
other german acts that tried to sound like kraftwerk. there's a
great article about it in massive magazine with stuart wall. has
interviews with these old style german elektro acts as well. so
much history there. this was printed in 95 or 96 i believe.  

well, if it referred to them as "electro", it would be pretty much
wrong. the usual term used to refer to can, faust, kraftwerk, etc
is "kraut rock". 

http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDMISS70311081103382187&sql=C2677

go look at that. dont hurt yourself. 

>break dancing was yet another fad like disco that pretty much
came and went. yes africa bambata stole trans europe express like
most of the black artists did back then. 

i think you want to fight me. anyway, youre showing your ignorance
again. arthur baker had as much to do with planet rock as
bambaataa did. 

>i hate to admit this to because i am black myself but you have to
admit that kraftwerk were some crazy mother fr's. bambata stole or
borrowd the european originators music and they tried to call it
his own. but everyone knows the truth and who created what.

yeah because last time i checked, they were trying to front like
they wrote that melody. 

>i'd like to see stories about disco djs making their own
instruments and composing purely synthetic musik like kraftwerk
did. got any? hahahahaha or maybe you can show me how they were
before kraftwerk and all. hahaha don't quit you're day job ya
> sissy. 

giorgio moroder made his "from here to eternity" LP in 77, the
same year kraftwerk made the mostly electronic "trans europe
express". 

>i'm 37 bud. i know my history. 

obviously being alive that long hasnt helped you out one tiny bit. 

>wrong, kraftwerk was around making electronic music many many
years before disco had even started. 

what does this have to do with anything? disco isnt electronic
music for the most part. it is directly responsible for the 12"
single, and it brought techniques of dub music to a more
mainstream audience, but to call it "electronic music" would be
wrong. 

>and this crap about "mutated into garage" shows that you know
nothing of what has been discussed earlier. such a typical lemming

garage is generally a more electronic, 80s styled version of
disco. you could make more of an argument for this generation of
music to be called "electronic" music, but i still think that
would be missing the point by quite a bit. 

---------- Original Message ----------------------------------
From: chaos uk <bigmuff80s@yahoo.com>

>yes well electronic music had to get it's synthesized beat from
somewhere and it was certainly found in kraftwerk long before
disco had even started, doug.

and it was found in sly stone's material as well. but where the
"synthesized" beat wasnt found was in most disco records. aside
from the italo disco stuff and the 80s disco/garage type stuff,
most disco was made by studio bands in philadelphia and ney york. 

---------- Original Message ----------------------------------
From: chaos uk <bigmuff80s@yahoo.com>

>>dunno about "some time" before. 
> 
>no, clearly you don't.

actually, YOU dont. 

>yes well, soul wasn't exactly tekno/electronic music now was it,
no it wasn't. 

AND NEITHER IS DISCO YOU FUCKING MORON. even though certain people
did eventually make disco that was synthetic, that wasnt where it
came from. 

>soul was more musical instruments and the occasional piano here
and there ala the regressive side of music. kraftwerk were truly
synthetic masters. long before disco. 

your ignorance is hurting my head. seriously. anyway, their
organisation material contained no synthesized music. kraftwerk 1
didnt drop until 71 (and didnt even contain any synthesizer
either). before that, walter carlos created the first popular
synthesized albums "switched on bach" (68) and "the well tempered
synthesizer" (69). so technically, kraftwerk must have stolen
their ideas from those records, especially considering their love
of classical music. 

>incorrect, kraftwerk's progreessive and electronic side was under
the guise of their other name, "the organization" which was 1969-1970.

kraftwerk 1 and 2 definitely were still very rockish. autobahn was
still very convential sounding up against TEE or computer world or
man machine. 

>oh yes, real rockish there. it was purely a synthetic track. no
guitars, no rock influence at all. this is how i know i'm dealing
with a little kid. the little kid says big things but then fails
to understand who the creatros are and simple incorrect things
about a song that was litterally one of the most infleuntial in
electronic musik.   you failed, son. F- 

autobahn still used guitars. i dont know what to say about that
other than the fact that compared to their later sound that was
very close to what would later come, autobahn sounds more
conventional. 

>no not pre-disco but "warsaw" was around the same time. joy
division was simply an extension of warsaw and also part of the
later, casualist dance scene. 

warsaw was punk, not dance. even joy division was much more punk
than it was dance related, and that shit all happened well after
disco had its popular explosion. 

>incorrect, cabaret voltaire were making musik in 1974 which
easilly predates disco. *yawn*

but they werent making anything resebling kraftwerk or disco at
that point. so what the fuck does it matter? thats like arguing
that musique concrete is actually techno. its not, though
obviously its influence is in there. 

>i don't need to read about it. i lived it. 

you realise that eye witness accounts are often the least reliable
evidence in courts? 

>no, they weren't influence by giorrgio(who isn't sh!t btw. 

thats all you had to say to prove how little you know about this.
thanks. 

>bloody fool!! elektro was born and rooted from kraftwerk's trans
europe express among others by them. again, this tells me you do
not know what you're talking about and haven't read what i've
explained.  hip hop wasn't even alive when kraftwerk had put out
this mastrpiece. i could go to earlier kraftwerk releases and find
elektro as well. they truly were amazing artists.  

i was never saying kraftwerk were anything less than great. i
admire them. but youre attributing things to them that dont belong
there. 

anyway, why do you think afrika bambaataa wanted to use "numbers"
and "TEE" for planet rock? because hed been using them as a
deejay, for years in the case of TEE. i think youre still
confusing kraut rock with electro here. 

>Vitriolic diatribes show an unrefined or uncivilized disposition
- not that of an intelligent person.

im not refined or civilized you fucking nitwit. if you think i
care if anyone thinks im either those or intelligent, youre
greatly mistaken. but i am right, and thats all that counts. 

>Btw I believe "youre" was misspelled.

if by that you mean i left out the "'", good for you. i like to
type quickly, and i pretty much never use apostrophes. if you
meant some other way, then i dont know what to say about you. 

---------- Original Message ----------------------------------
From: chaos uk <bigmuff80s@yahoo.com>

>another funny little thing about disco. if it was so frickin
great then why didn't the fad continue eh?

um, it did continue. if you think that house has more to do with
kraftwerk than disco, youre smoking it. 

>at least with techno we know it was rooted kraftwerk and
continued on through the late 70's with artists like the normal,
fad gadget and into the early 80's with depeche(big muff,
photographic, etc) fad gadget(lady shave etc), new order, front
242(body to body), among the numerous synth techno acts.

good music, not techno. 

>then of course we come to "detroit" techno and people like
derrick may talking about his huge influences on the bbc special
called "the perfect beat", where he says, "i had mother fu*kin
depeche mode on my floor, new order, people wanted to know what
the f...k this stuff was i was lisening to". 

this is without question. but his trips to chicago to see ron
hardy and frankie knuckles deejay is what led him to make the
music he did. strings of life was big in chicago first. and where
did frankie knuckles come from? he was friends with larry levan,
who WAS the paradise garage who played fucking disco records. when
it comes down to straight up techno, disco and house had as much
to do with it as kraftwerk. thats what made techno sound different
from house, which was essentially stripped down electronic disco. 

>if i had a choice i'd pick the genre that built manyy excellent
sub-genres, gave birth to an exciting scene, then continued to
mutate into something greater than that, to where we still hear
it's beat and sounds today. 

you mean disco, right? seriously, if you think house music had
nothing to do with any of this, youre veery mistaken. and house
was a direct extension of disco. 

>in short, i'll pass on the donna summer remixes that ol giorgio
did and look to the true creators of the early 70s and their
counterparts in the 80's. 

giorgio didnt just do remixes of donna summer tracks you fucking
twat. eh. im bored with your poor arguments now. good luck.

but this ideal still pervades in the computer production world as
well. now instead of buying a new synth every couple years, youll
have to buy a whole new computer and/or interface to be able to
pay even more money for the next software upgrade. this hyper
turnover of technology in making music isnt turning over the
quality. its not like as soon as a new technology hits the streets
a ton of new songs unlike anything anyone's heard before come out.
this makes me question what the motivation for putting out these
products really is. id say its probably 5% making things
better/easier, 95% trying to make a ton of money for upgrading
very little. 

>the mainstream culture didnt invade dnb...dnb has been about
technicality 
>and progression from day 1...if u dont believe this you are lying to 
>yourself...

i dont think that is true. its been about twisting things up,
thats for sure. when 95 era jungle was popular, alot of people
were still using the s950, a sampler made in 1988. i guess the
large influx of money shortly thereafter is what caused the upward
spiral of technology to conquer the downward spiral of tune
quality. that really has to be it now that i think of it. and
whats funny is that the door to creating drum and bass on the
highest level became as closed at it has ever been in those first
couple years of production values outweighing tunes. its really
been since stealing software has made it possible for anyone to be
on almost the same level as the big wigs that the playing field
has evened out again. 

>new synths come out that make new sounds...creative producers 
>will use every tool availible to them...

im not sure thats true. i know alot of people put high creative
value on limiting their possibilites of production. this has
definitely worked out for some people, even on major label
recordings (tom morello of RATM refuses to use synths or samplers
or record scratching, he makes all those weird sounds himself on
his guitar). but in jungle i think that attitude is nearly gone.
and IMO it has contributed to the sterilization of the sound.

with it...what

theres a really really great article on rob playford, and you can
see that he was still getting down garbage style (quadraverbs? ha,
i love those things) in 98 in addition to bringing in protools and
whatnot. but you can see the effect of this mentality towards the
bottom when he talks about macs being a black hole of money.

>tunes suck this is true...but there is plenty of good to...even
tunes that 
>suck usually have something cool about them, at least 1 sound
nobody has 
>ever used or some new processing trick...

this is my point though. id rather hear a great track with no new
sounds but a new idea than an average or weak track that has some
new technology at work. with this kind of circular progression
going on, the new sounds are limited by what the technology
dictates, not by what your imagination can come up with.

exactly. but how many people in drum and bass seem satisfied with
the perfectly engineered turd? i wish there was some simple cure
for this, but it might be too late. id love to see someone come in
with a strictly lo fi setup who made tunes that sound unlike the
new stuff and have it blow up. i doubt that it will happen, but
one tune could start that revolution the same way "acid trax" made
people need the 303.

there was still a good bit of overengineered stuff when the UK was
going strong. IMO ed rush and optical really kicked off this whole
thing. not that their tunes were bad, because i dont think thats
true. but i do think that suddenly there was some new technical
precision that they had that other people could emulate without
having a good tune behind it. at least with their stuff is when i
noticed it first. shortly thereafter, RAM did some similar stuff
with the sound in motion comp. not bad tunes, but definitely
helped start a shift from tunes to technology.

i know im biased, but your stuff definitely does sound better that
most peoples stuff coming straight out of the computer. really the
way it seems to me is that the more the computer is totally
integrated, the less it becomes about tune quality.

as antipiracy technology increases, maybe we'll see those programs
actually become secure so you cant just DL them. that would force
people to stick with the last possible version of their software.
then maybe to sound different theyll go out and buy some old
hardware. and then maybe that will be how the spiral starts.

Most people rent U-haul trucks when they need to move a lot of furniture and 
other things. ...for most people moving isn't a lifestyle. I know lots of 
people who regularly scuba dive, rock climb, ski, etc.

I don't think a family of 5 who goes on camping trips every weekend is going 
to want to deal with a  Ford Tempo.

Perhaps getting stuck on an icy mountain in the middle of winter isn't 
somebody's idea of a safe vacation?

There are certain lifestyles that permit the use of a sport utility vehicle. 
Do you really need examples?

Why do you refuse to acknowledge the practicality and usefulness of the SUV?

There are too many cases where people drive SUV's when they have no real 
reason to other than the fact that P-Diddy takes his to the golf range in 
his music videos, but that doesn't eliminate the cases where they are 
actually helpful.

Man has been destroying the environment since his conception, I don't think 
its going to change anytime soon. I am prepared to share the fruits of 
nature's labor, because the humans are destroying it regardless of whether I 
take advantage of luxury or not!

Fuck it, we should all just use pack mules and ride horses.

>format of songs.

I just don't believe every label is money grubbing just because it is 
progressive house. There are many independent labels who aren't raking in 
the huge bills but still try their best to promote their "sound" and create 
music they enjoy.

I also don't think people buy records just because the producers have... 
"pretty white faces". How many of these producers do people actually look 
at? I have records upon records and have no idea the ethnicity of the 
producers behind them... but I do know that John Creamer has an ugly mug 
(his productions of late have been very disappointing though), Yunus Guvenen 
is definitely turkish, and Moshic is 100% Israeli. I find it hard to believe 
that progressive house makes money because they are primarily caucasian.

Is it hard to believe that producers are consumers and they both have 
similar tastes? Maybe sometimes what sells is what people actually like? 
Maybe people actually WANT to make money off of making music? How can you 
blame them?  And do you think that all prog records are "built for mass 
consumption?" Barry Robb (Sphere) is a fantastic producer (not by your 
ridiculous standards and guidelines I'm sure), and he hasn't made shit off 
of any of his many brilliant productions. Most of the actual quality prog 
house (what I believe to be quality are the records that I enjoy) aren't 
real big money makers, and as long as the music is still good I don't care 
whether they are making money or not!

It seems like you look at progressive house music as this genre where guys 
sit in these huge expensive studios, spend 20 minutes over-producing a 
formulated boring piece of consumer garbage so they can make an extra buck 
jumping around behind the decks like a ritz cracker.

>the thing is, imagine someone decided to have the pop star
>mentality by spinning drum and bass. it wouldnt work. what would
>you do, grow a mullet, start talking about dungeons and dragons
>and pretend youre heavy metal now? oh wait.

So you are saying that Dieselboy wanted to become a pop-star, so he has 
lowered the bar for Drum n' Bass in general? I could believe that, I don't 
know wtf he is trying to do talking about DnD. Like his personal intersts 
have any affect to being with. What a tool. Seriously, what is he going for 
here?

Plus, do you think he is a direct result of crappy DnB that is coming out 
now? He might be... please explain. I haven't heard any of his recent mixes. 
Are they pretty horrible?

My point initially was that there will always be good producers that enjoy 
making good music when money isn't a factor... and just because you don't 
like it doesn't mean they are churning out useless crap... and just because 
of what you label it doesn't mean they are doing it for the money! But you 
would disagree so lets stop this discussion now because it is hard to talk 
about matters of opinion with someone who doesn't seem to have a sense of 
empathy  ;p

>sure, but unless youre stealing your stuff, it still costs lots of
>dough to put together an all software studio, as well as paying
>for all the high end computer hardware. dual CPU macs + a protools
>interface and program is no joke, youre looking at like $5000 and
>up depending on how intricate you go.

If you ask me, the people who would be putting this kind of money into a 
studio usually end up being professionals in the first place. What it takes 
for neophyte producers with talent to make good music is very minimal, as 
you already know.

James Holden, whos got a lot of talent and makes great progressive music, 
uses Buzz software. Which is 100% free, and you can run just about any type 
of software on a PC that costs less than 900 clams to build.... and everyone 
should own a computer like that anyways! ;p

>but i think the whole corporate music mentality has invaded dance
>music both in consumption (prog) and in production (new expensive
>synths). its all part of the same downward spiral.

I am against the corporate mentality myself, but I am also all about new and 
improved technology.

All I'm trying to get at is that you shouldn't blacklist (for lack of a 
better term) an entire genre of music because of assumptions you make due to 
the less-than-admirable acts of their mainstream faces.

Not liking the music because you find it predictable, boring, whatever is 
perfectly fine...I completely understand why you would think so. There is a 
LOT of great music out there... but when you start calling all prog house 
producers crackers wanting to make a buck...well, you are just being 
musically racist.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJs choose new paths as electronica goes back underground

the "underground" is such a different entity now, or
it will be... the underground will not be the way it
used to be. im afraid the genres will all be split up
when before you could here dnb, breaks, house, trance
etc... all in one night. half of the places around
here still do that but in some instances people have
taken their music and built walls around it. the
underground now for some is at little clubs or
resturaunts or bars. its all one kind of sound. havana
- house, bbt - dnb. you still have zythos on weds and
tangos on sat. these guys are doing what i think is
the better thing. these places to me attract better
people even. dont get me wrong guys.. i like havana
and the bbt but the attitudes there are a lot more
stuck up.

id hate to see the trend of the underground turn into
seclusion. "oh, you play breaks??? youre a
cheeseball". or "man those techno guys are a bunch of
nerds". or "geez those dnb kids think theyre really
hard". wether you like it or not these are the things
people think and say. id like to see the underground
solidify itself a lot more. im afraid that the more we
distance ourselfs from eachother the worse of this
whole scene is gonna be. maybe im paranoid.

there are a lot of kids saying theyre down with the
underground and at the same time there are a lot of
weeklies held on the weekends that are underground and
doing bad or dead. UNION was a fine example for this.
i dont think anyone even remembers it but, we tried to
let every kind of edm play there. except HHC, wich is
just gay. the night didnt last three months before
everyone dropped off. the vibe i got was that everyone
was looking around thinking "man, look at those dorks"
who were getting down to house. or "man, look at those
tuff guys" who were sitting in the corner waiting for
the dnb. it just seemed like no one could just
appreciate the diversity of the "scene".

i hope this whole edm thing doesnt break appart.

>well, if it referred to them as "electro", it would be pretty much
wrong. the usual term used to refer to can, faust, kraftwerk, etc
is "kraut rock". 
 
erm, no, kraftwerk's "early work" was called progressive.the 68-70 stuff.  Faust WAS considered krautrock but that was their early stuff.  "can" i didn't even bring up and wasn't talking about them. for the record the massive magazine article wasn't reffering to any of these artists. mr wall interviewed german ELECTRO artists of the 70's not *laugh* krautrock. 
 
>yeah because last time i checked, they were trying to front like
they wrote that melody. 
 
see this is what i'm talking about. i'm dealing with a simian plebeian dirtbag lemming here. you know nothing of what's been explained. 
 
>giorgio moroder made his "from here to eternity" LP in 77, the
same year kraftwerk made the mostly electronic "trans europe
express".
 
what a joke! you want to compare giorgio to kraftwerk?! another bloody fool.
autobahn was put out in 74' and tanz muzik in 73'. 
kraftwerk's 77' lp predates giorgio's by months and by the numbers of sales completetly destroys any pathtic 500-1000 copies sold of mr tito lafuente giorgio. *laugh* 
look you obviously don't want to give credit where it's due. but you have to understand that kraftwerk trailblazed the path for electronic musik. even certain disco artists and casuals dj'd their records and tried to copy their sounds. no one in their right mind would be in such denial about this. once again you simply show your ignorance to this subject. 
 
>obviously being alive that long hasnt helped you out one tiny bit. 
 
hah i own three houses that are worth 500 thousand each. i'd say it's helped me a bit. especially the way the market's gone lately. and only a dirtbag like you would go this route. you're probably living in an apartment, with mommy or some other pathetic state of nothingness. 
   
>disco isnt electronic music for the most part. 
 
ahh very good grasshoper, now you're starting to learn. i think we can now thank the real and true electronic artists out there for their effort. 
 
>and it was found in sly stone's material as well. 
 
i'm calling your bluff, i want to hear sly and the family stones "electronic" or "synthesized" 4x4 kickdrum that predates kraftwerks. as i remember sly never even used an electronic kick until much later on. of course you will prove me wrong, correct? fucking liar.
 
>but where the "synthesized" beat wasnt found was in most disco records.
 
yes, no one is disputing this, simian. 
 
>AND NEITHER IS DISCO YOU FUCKING MORON. even though certain people
did eventually make disco that was synthetic, that wasnt where it
came from. 
 
um, plebeian, i never said disco WAS you blithering IDIOT! your vitriol is past it's due date.

>organisation material contained no synthesized music.
 
perhaps not a synth per se but they did use an electronic organ. 
 
>kraftwerk 1
 
*yawn* kraftwerk's first lp came out in 1970 and was recorded from july to august. not 1971' MORON. again with your stupidity
 
>autobahn was still very convential sounding up against TEE or computer world or
man machine. 
 
well many consider it one of the first techno songs but i wouldn't call it conventional(not that it's a bad term mind you) it's quite a nice electronic masterpiece. even noted throughtout certain detroit circles as a big influence. 
 
>autobahn still used guitars
 
autobahn was a completely synthesized track. i can't believe you're this stupid. 
 
>but they werent making anything resebling kraftwerk or disco at
that point. 
 
hahaha wrong again, they were making many things resembling kraftwerk in 76' and 77' this was their experimental electronic side and time period.
 
>anyway, why do you think afrika bambaataa wanted to use "numbers"
and "TEE" for planet rock?
 
because he's a fuking theif. point blank. ralf even comments on this in a recent interview from bar code. 
 
>i think youre still confusing kraut rock with electro here. 
 
i would never be so retarded as you to infer that kraftwerk are "krautROCK". 
  
>good music, not techno. 
 
the techno influence with sytnhed kick drum and sounds are all there. so they threw on sone vocals, big deal. early techno always had vocals via kraftwerk, among other 70's artists. the early 80's tracks, photographic, just can't get enough, big muff, body to body, lady shave, etc. all have dominant techno influences in them. big muff in fact is completely technoized, and an all instrumental track. fad gadget's lady shave is completely technoized as well other than the lyrics over the top. but like a lot of early techno, it had lyrics. 
 
>this is without question.
 
yes well we know his real influences don't we. and let's keep things in perspective, this is the later side of techno music or detroit style techno as they called it. this wasn't the early 80's stuff like depeche mode, new order influenced stuff, etc. "i had mother fuckin depehce mode on my floor, new order".  he wouldn't have mentioned them as his biggest influences if he didn't mean it. depeche mode, new order, photographic or the purely techno "big muff". take a f...g listen to big muff, it's pure techno. sounds similar to a few of derrick's detroit numbers yet only better. the belgians and other germans like talla2xlc(techno club at dorian grey airport in germany 84'85'86') picked up on newer 80's techno in their own way as well. front 242's early work, depeche modes, new orders, fad gadgets, blancemange, etc etc. i could f....g go on forever.
anyway, like i said, it goes on. 
disco was a fad. 
deal with it.
the music we got here today with was techno not disco.
 
>im bored with your poor arguments now. good luck.
 
ahhh yes, as i figured. the little bitch-girl shows his true colors and runs away. your arguments were baseless and proved inacurate anyway. how pathetic on your part. 
 
now run along little kiddie. run back to the garbage can you came from.

>well, if it referred to them as "electro", it would be pretty much
wrong. the usual term used to refer to can, faust, kraftwerk, etc
is "kraut rock". 
 
erm, no, kraftwerk's "early work" was called progressive.the 68-70 stuff.  Faust WAS considered krautrock but that was their early stuff.  "can" i didn't even bring up and wasn't talking about them. for the record the massive magazine article wasn't reffering to any of these artists. mr wall interviewed german ELECTRO artists of the 70's not *laugh* krautrock. 
 
>yeah because last time i checked, they were trying to front like
they wrote that melody. 
 
see this is what i'm talking about. i'm dealing with a simian plebeian dirtbag lemming here. you know nothing of what's been explained. 
 
>giorgio moroder made his "from here to eternity" LP in 77, the
same year kraftwerk made the mostly electronic "trans europe
express".
 
what a joke! you want to compare giorgio to kraftwerk?! another bloody fool.
autobahn was put out in 74' and tanz muzik in 73'. 
kraftwerk's 77' lp predates giorgio's by months and by the numbers of sales completetly destroys any pathtic 500-1000 copies sold of mr tito lafuente giorgio. *laugh* 
look you obviously don't want to give credit where it's due. but you have to understand that kraftwerk trailblazed the path for electronic musik. even certain disco artists and casuals dj'd their records and tried to copy their sounds. no one in their right mind would be in such denial about this. once again you simply show your ignorance to this subject. 
 
>obviously being alive that long hasnt helped you out one tiny bit. 
 
hah i own three houses that are worth 500 thousand each. i'd say it's helped me a bit. especially the way the market's gone lately. and only a dirtbag like you would go this route. you're probably living in an apartment, with mommy or some other pathetic state of nothingness. 
   
>disco isnt electronic music for the most part. 
 
ahh very good grasshoper, now you're starting to learn. i think we can now thank the real and true electronic artists out there for their effort. 
 
>and it was found in sly stone's material as well. 
 
i'm calling your bluff, i want to hear sly and the family stones "electronic" or "synthesized" 4x4 kickdrum that predates kraftwerks. as i remember sly never even used an electronic kick until much later on. of course you will prove me wrong, correct? fucking liar.
 
>but where the "synthesized" beat wasnt found was in most disco records.
 
yes, no one is disputing this, simian. 
 
>AND NEITHER IS DISCO YOU FUCKING MORON. even though certain people
did eventually make disco that was synthetic, that wasnt where it
came from. 
 
um, plebeian, i never said disco WAS you blithering IDIOT! your vitriol is past it's due date.

>organisation material contained no synthesized music.
 
perhaps not a synth per se but they did use an electronic organ. 
 
>kraftwerk 1
 
*yawn* kraftwerk's first lp came out in 1970 and was recorded from july to august. not 1971' MORON. again with your stupidity
 
>autobahn was still very convential sounding up against TEE or computer world or
man machine. 
 
well many consider it one of the first techno songs but i wouldn't call it conventional(not that it's a bad term mind you) it's quite a nice electronic masterpiece. even noted throughtout certain detroit circles as a big influence. 
 
>autobahn still used guitars
 
autobahn was a completely synthesized track. i can't believe you're this stupid. 
 
>but they werent making anything resebling kraftwerk or disco at
that point. 
 
hahaha wrong again, they were making many things resembling kraftwerk in 76' and 77' this was their experimental electronic side and time period.
 
>anyway, why do you think afrika bambaataa wanted to use "numbers"
and "TEE" for planet rock?
 
because he's a fuking theif. point blank. ralf even comments on this in a recent interview from bar code. 
 
>i think youre still confusing kraut rock with electro here. 
 
i would never be so retarded as you to infer that kraftwerk are "krautROCK". 
  
>good music, not techno. 
 
the techno influence with sytnhed kick drum and sounds are all there. so they threw on sone vocals, big deal. early techno always had vocals via kraftwerk, among other 70's artists. the early 80's tracks, photographic, just can't get enough, big muff, body to body, lady shave, etc. all have dominant techno influences in them. big muff in fact is completely technoized, and an all instrumental track. fad gadget's lady shave is completely technoized as well other than the lyrics over the top. but like a lot of early techno, it had lyrics. 
 
>this is without question.
 
yes well we know his real influences don't we. and let's keep things in perspective, this is the later side of techno music or detroit style techno as they called it. this wasn't the early 80's stuff like depeche mode, new order influenced stuff, etc. "i had mother fuckin depehce mode on my floor, new order".  he wouldn't have mentioned them as his biggest influences if he didn't mean it. depeche mode, new order, photographic or the purely techno "big muff". take a f...g listen to big muff, it's pure techno. sounds similar to a few of derrick's detroit numbers yet only better. the belgians and other germans like talla2xlc(techno club at dorian grey airport in germany 84'85'86') picked up on newer 80's techno in their own way as well. front 242's early work, depeche modes, new orders, fad gadgets, blancemange, etc etc. i could f....g go on forever.
anyway, like i said, it goes on. 
disco was a fad. 
deal with it.
the music we got here today with was techno not disco.
 
>im bored with your poor arguments now. good luck.
 
ahhh yes, as i figured. the little bitch-girl shows his true colors and runs away. your arguments were baseless and proved inacurate anyway. how pathetic on your part. 
 
now run along little kiddie. run back to the garbage can you came from.

Hey,

Wondering if anyone has been in touch with Brian "Debaser" (don't know his 
last name). If anyone could forward this to him or put me in touch, I would 
greatly appreciate it.

Also, if anyone is planning anything as far as a memorial kind of gig for my 
brother Space, let me know. I feel like I should at least have a little say 
in how he is remembered and what, if anything, is said.

Thanks,
~Josh

Columbus, Ohio, eh?... 10-1, BCS #2 is a little better than...

fighting for draft position. (atlanta, jacksonville and san diego luckily
are the three teams worse than the steelers, so they would get the #4 draft
pick... i'd suggest a defensive back...)

And the last time I checked, the two Ohio NFL teams (not that I care about
them either) were better than the stillers... and that includes the
Bung-alls.

I can bag the stillers cause i've never been a fan, nor have they given me
any reason to be.

By the way, anyone interested in watching the Ohio State/Michigan game this
weekend hit me up, I'll be in good form and pumped to watch Tresselball on
HDTV.

1) I _USED_ to like you, but you've now given me reason to think otherwise.

2) One losing season does not a bad team make...the opposite is also true. Let's take a look at the
last 5 Bung-hole's seasons, compare them with the Steelers'. And then add that the Bengals' new head
coach this season is a FORMER STEELERS coach. Ahem....but I digress....

2.5) How many pro sports championships do Ohio teams have? How about Pittsburgh alone?

3) The BCS is a joke, and it's only "vaunted" by those who stand to gain from it.

none of the new submerge related releases rate for you, 
eh? "pipecarrier" and "aguila" are in the top 10 for this year 
methinks.

i did like that fabrice, though i didnt pick it up. i think im

I was trying to cue up "The toiling of idle hands" at Abbasso while Damon left the booth briefly.  But the bastard came back and wouldn't play it for me!  :P   That track is sweet.  

Man, ya can't beat the Germans when it comes to techno!

Naw.  Antwaan has it covered.

Watch our games.  Tommy Turnover Maddox would do a *lot* better if he had
more than a second to throw the ball on a regular basis.  Our defense
isn't terrible, but without an offensive line to give Maddox some time,
we're sunk.

but the thing is, we have a good mobile QB who doesnt turn the 
ball over and who was a damn good performer behind one of the 
worst offensive lines in the league. his name is charlie batch, 
and hes riding the pine because maddox is white. its really 
infuriating.

<<Tommy Turnover Maddox would do a *lot* better if he had more than a second to throw the ball on a
regular basis.>>

That's only half true. Labeling him "Turnover Tommy" is BS, considering the shit Stewart threw up in
the air when he had the best O-line in the league.... No disputing the current weakness on offesnive
line now whatsoever, but the Bus USED to be able to make something out of nothing in these sorts of
situations. Now, he is AT BEST making 60 yds. a game on 12-15 runs (*against teams with equally weak
d-lines, no less*).

Zeroue is to much an east-west runner, and not enough north-south runner to be as effective as
Bettis was in his prime. He wouldn't cut it as the sole star running back.

But, regardless....back to our original topic of draft picks...offensive linemen should NEVER be
your first round draft pick.

Subject: {pb-cle} 'da Stillers

I love the football smack on here... don't forget it's
Steelers vs. Browns week!!! We should start a PB-CLE
football list. Tonight against the 49'ers is gonna be
rough for Pittsburgh I think. 

My take on the Steelers is simple... they have a TON
of holes in thier lineup now. They will need to get
some help at QB, RB and in the secondary on defense at
the very least in the offseason to get back to the
playoffs. And they have to keep thier strong WR core
together and get a guy who can get them the ball more
consistently. Maddox and/or Batch are not the answer.

Steelers fans prob. should write this season off but
with the right offseason manuvering you can be right
back next year.

1) *shrug*

2) Um, so was the Bengals last head coach, shit load of good it did them.
And their current coach was only well known once he left Pittsburgh for
the-artists-formerly-known-as-the-Cleveland-Browns.

2.5) Pro?  The Browns had a ton of NFL championships pre-Super Bowl.  The
Cincinnati Reds have several (most recently 1990), and the Indians had a few
pre-1954.  I won't really count hockey since Ohio just got a team, what, two
years ago?

3) I really doubt that Putt would make a big splash in a playoff system,
since they can't even beat Notre Dame.

i am ubiquitous.
 
no one told *me* said picture would end up online. whatever though, it's not like there isn't another similar picture of the two of us on the net already. $5 to anyone who can find it--Valerie, that doesn't apply to you :.

moral of the story: don't ask me to make out with you when i'm wasted- cuz i will and someone will take a picture and put it on the internet.  hahaha.
 
the best part of the night was coming out of abbasso only to find my car completely COVERED in Paul Oakenfold flyers cuz i told some biznitch not to put that shit on my car. this was funny because my formerly drunk ass deserved it and i would have done the same thing to anyone who had been so rude to me handing out flyers. ok well maybe that wasn't the best part but i got one hell of a laugh out of it.
 
see whoever knows @ hybrid tomorrow night!!!

I'm sure my rather loud..."Oakenfold sucks" as we went into the club sure helped your car situation.  hehe. 
 
But then again, if your car had not been plastered, I would not have gone in to drag you out so I could see your face and laugh before I left, then I would not have gotten to hear Papa drop that always magnificent underworld track. 
 
Hey and if anyone wants to win Steph's bet...give me even $1 and I'll tell ya where to look
(I mean hey you'll make $4 still, and  $1 buys a hoegarden at Wish these days; P)
 
Have fun at Hybrid you lucky losers who have lives where you can do that sort of thing.

no one told *me* said picture would end up online. whatever though, it's not like there isn't another similar picture of the two of us on the net already. $5 to anyone who can find it--Valerie, that doesn't apply to you :.

moral of the story: don't ask me to make out with you when i'm wasted- cuz i will and someone will take a picture and put it on the internet. hahaha.

the best part of the night was coming out of abbasso only to find my car completely COVERED in Paul Oakenfold flyers cuz i told some biznitch not to put that shit on my car. this was funny because my formerly drunk ass deserved it and i would have done the same thing to anyone who had been so rude to me handing out flyers. ok well maybe that wasn't the best part but i got one hell of a laugh out of it.

see whoever knows @ hybrid tomorrow night!!!

Subject: {pb-cle} live circuit bending tonight [pgh]


FYI

>>>
Tuesday november 18th
quiet storm
5430 penn ave
9pm

Thanks to the Daniel Langlois Foundation, here comes a
mad scientist and some mad circuit benders. Peter B
has created several original musical instruments,
called shinths, which are circuit boards filled with
invisible twittering machines. They have no inputs or
outputs- they require circuit benders, who make music
out of the process of breaking electronics, to come
with alligator clips and break, coax, or otherwise
force sounds out. The upcoming tour will feature other
unusual electronic instruments, rollable synthesizers,
coats with electronic bells inside, and the shinths
themselves, which are modeled after life preservers.
The selected performers will also bring their own toys
and styles. Like castaways from a wrecked ship of
consumer technology the benders/remixers will grow
more haggard as the tour progresses, and their flotsam
techno toys will become more and more noisy.

No rules, just a constant tag team of short sets
between performers Twig Harper (of Nautical Almanac),
John Fashion Flesh (of the Super Madrigal Brothers),
and other acts.

SACD isn't going to make music any better.  If it was crap on a CD, then
it's going to be crap on a SACD, just in 5.1 sound.

I do have a blue man group dvd-a disc.  I can notice a difference on my
home stereo, which is a prologic setup.  But not on my computer, which
only has two speakers.  I even tried it with the DSP I have that makes
headphones sound like there are 5 actual speakers (i.e. you can hear stuff
behind you) and still didn't notice a difference.

I thnk DVD-A will beat out SACD simply because if you have a dvd player,
you can play DVD-A.  SACD, though, needs decoding.  Although practically
all players that come out now can do that, the older ones, like mine,
can't.  I can't even play mp3s on mine.

I was under the impression that the DVD-A format, wasn't really
generally compatable with most DVD players because of some component
audio out BS. I can't remember, but it's already a dead format. The
future of formats is that there is no format, rather you can just play
your songs from everywhere and not think about it.

I dunno, mine has digital audio out, but I just use the rca jacks.  I
thought that's what the selling point was on DVD-A, that if it plays dvds,
it will play dvd-a.

did some quick searching on google:
http://www.disctronics.co.uk/technology/dvdaudio/dvdaud_comp.htm
http://www.disctronics.co.uk/downloads/tech_docs/dvdaudio.pdf - more
detailed info

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} top 11


most techno that i've been into lately have been coming from cities
other than detroit.  labels like perlon, playhouse, treibstoff, force
inc, force records, poker flat, trapez, kompact, immigrant, are almost
all from outside the us.  i've had detroit techno beaten into me for
years and have crates full of those records.  to be honest, ever since
jaguar i'm kind of sick all the dramatic/epic strings you find in the
submerge distributed stuff.  besides, i'm more into the slightly deeper
and more textured techno and tech house.  while i still enjoy listening
to stuff from the old detroit labels, i'm not buying much of it anymore.

none of the new submerge related releases rate for you, 
eh? "pipecarrier" and "aguila" are in the top 10 for this year 
methinks.

i did like that fabrice, though i didnt pick it up. i think im 
done with liking john tejada though........

Not true.  If a woman is bisexual.  she can suck dick, but also sucking
pussy as well.  if she's a thesbian, then she doesnt' suck dick


p.s.  yes, I did mean on putting thesbian there, and yes, I know it's
wrong, deal with it.

i think you're missing the point.  the comment was made to be as

Actually, You're wrong, there is no such thing as gay, straight, bisexual...
I tend to agree with Tucker Max that everyone is on a sliding scale
somewhere in the grey area between being straight and 100% gay (loving the
cock)...

this and other fabulous ideas at www.tuckermax.com

That makes sense.  In fact isn't there a quiz that's kinda like that,
except it determines if your a guy or a girl.  I'm sure someone here has
the link to it

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Gay Marriage legal in Mass!

Frankly...I don't care about Cleveland's music scene.  Hell, I barely read
the list at all anymore, cause it's all a bunch of bullshit that's not
worth reading.  If I want to go listen to good music, I'll do that. 
Although there are still "discussions" about musical related things now
and again on here still, they're all pretty boring.  They all just say the
same things that have been said in the past.  They're all between the same
10 people who always get in on the discussions.  What's the big deal if we
talk about gay marriage.  Lighten up!  This is the first actual post I've
read on this list in weeks because I figured it would be something new...

Whatever, not like it matters anyways...

Sorry for the post to the list, but I can't email the person cause my

You might want to tell andy something is up with his mail.. I'm getting
all my messages to andythepooh.com and technoiraudio.com returned as
suspected spam.  And they are all a day off (i.e. You emails today all say

its the answer to the question of the meaning of life the universe 
and everything. the question hadnt actually been determined. thats 
the reason they built the earth, and then shortly before earth was 
to have produced the question, it was blown up to make room for 
the intergalactic super highway.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: OMG I am SO FUCKING PISSED I have to vent...

OK I know some of you on here are familiar with and
have ridden in my blue hoopty-van. Well I have been
letting my dad borrow it for like weeks cuz he lost
his company car so I wanted to help him out. Anyway, I
just went over there and noticed the windows were down
a bit and it's raining so I go over to it to make sure
my amp (an old JBL that I bought when I lived in Cali)
and my sub aren't getting wet and guess what??? NO
FUCKING AMP or SUB. Fucking thieves took my shit. My
dad just had a bunch of tools taken from his garage
recently and he leaves my shit unlocked. Stupid &
irresponsible. I am SO ANGRY right now I fucking
swear. What is the point of trying to have anything
nice in this world, it will just get taken, trashed or
taxed. I can't really ask him to replace the shit so I
guess I lose out a few hundred bucks. I shoulda known
something would come along to piss me off for this
weekend that I had high hopes for.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: OMG I am SO FUCKING PISSED I have to vent...

I know how it feels man.

I spent about 1100 bucks (at Circuit City discount) on my car stereo...

I was asked to close a shift out for this guy the next night. A total of 
three hours.

Well, all of my shit was stolen right out of the circuit city parking 
lot..including a huge CD book. less than 24 hours after I saved months to 
buy it... looks like they justu sed a scredriver + hammer to poke my lock 
through.

Blows man.

Maybe you can get homeowner's insurance? They couldn't replace my equipment 
but they gave me money for all the CD's I lost (up to 1000$)

sorry to hear it man!

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} computer problems

i just installed a new HD and more RAM in my sister's computer. 
its a gateway (blech) p3 746 mhz. its got 320 megs of ram now. i 
installed windows XP pro the other day, and everything was working 
fine. now its giving her beef, and i cant figure out what the deal 
is. in the task manager, it says the processor is running @ 100% 
all the time, even though other programs still execute mostly 
properly and in the regular amount of time. now it wont allow her 
to burn CDs at all amongst other things. the process thats is 
hogging all the CPU power is either mdm32.exe or svchost.exe. what 
makes me think it could be a virus of some sort is the fact that 
when i try running regedit or windows XP patches or norton 
antivirus, it just kind of shuts them down for no good reason. 
anyone have any idea what the problem could be?

Well, looks like I'm heading out tonight to see Hybrid.  Didn't think I was 
going since my hubby works so hard, and doesn't feel like going out on work 
nights.  I'm rolling out with my friend Emily and Chelsea (Moose's 
girlfriend).  Should be a fun night. :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} computer problems

that's about the most "help desk-ish" answer possible.

first off, did you have any virus protection before the problem started
occurring?  it's always good nowadays to do this, just cause there are so
many piece of shit buffer overrun virii that attack system files.

have you installed XP Service Pack 1 or any of the hotfixes up to at least
824146?

svchost is the file that is used to initialize dll's as services... some are
virii, some are legitimate services (print spooler, etc), some are drivers
for your hardware... less than adequate sound cards sometimes give XP shit,
as well as video cards... try to update the drivers of these.

Ad-aware... sheesh.  Just look in the registry yourself...
hkey_current_user, software, microsoft, windows, current version, run ...
and look in the same for hkey_local_machine... typically on a newly
installed O/S without much software loaded, things stick out like a sore
thumb when they're not in the windows root directory as the path to the
files that get loaded at startup...

Also check to see whether the indexing service is running... that in itself
is the worst idea m$ ever had.  disable it if it is running.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} computer problems

Hopefully you have a nice fast internet connection.

After the BIOS POST screen, hit the f8 keys a few times.  A windows
start-up screen with options should come.  It might take a few times to
get this screen to appear, it's hard to explain the timing of the f8 key
strikes over the 'net.  

Anyways, chose SAFE MODE with networking.  

This will allow safe mode to run, along with internet access.

Now, open IE, go to:

http://housecall.trendmicro.com/ and run their online virus scan.

Chose Auto Clean, as you can step away for a half hour or so.

Now, after this, and all the viruses are clean, run Windows Update.  

It'll ask you for a few reboots, each reboot, take the first mentioned
steps and hold f8, safe mode w/networking.  Continue until all the
windows updates are ran.

Next download Ad-Aware (the free one) from www.lavasoftusa.com.  After
installing, but before scanning your system, use the update function.

Scan, whatever it finds (anything) (make sure you right click and select
all items), delete/clean/remove (whatever the option is..I forget).
Reboot once more in safe mode.

After all these steps, you should be good to go.  The newer operating
systems are pretty good about cleaning themselves up.

Now that's what I'd suggest first..just because it's better and more
reliable IN MY OPINION.

Ever since Windows ME/2k/XP, there is a feature called System Restore
that allows you to go back to a pre-backedup date.  Unless you manually
turned this option off, it should be good to go.  You won't need to save
any files, but I'm pretty sure (haven't done a system restore in a few
weeks) that any applications installed after the restore date won't be
there anymore.  Any special files they need will be, but the registry
settings won't match.

To access, go to start - programs - accessories - system tools - system
restore.

I'd go back as far as possible, but this is up to you.  If it can't
restore, it'll just reboot and give you an error.  You can bounce back
and forth...forward and back in time basically to find one you are happy
with.

Hope this is somewhat of a help...

i just installed a new HD and more RAM in my sister's computer. 
its a gateway (blech) p3 746 mhz. its got 320 megs of ram now. i 
installed windows XP pro the other day, and everything was working 
fine. now its giving her beef, and i cant figure out what the deal 
is. in the task manager, it says the processor is running @ 100% 
all the time, even though other programs still execute mostly 
properly and in the regular amount of time. now it wont allow her 
to burn CDs at all amongst other things. the process thats is 
hogging all the CPU power is either mdm32.exe or svchost.exe. what 
makes me think it could be a virus of some sort is the fact that 
when i try running regedit or windows XP patches or norton 
antivirus, it just kind of shuts them down for no good reason. 
anyone have any idea what the problem could be?

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: so i have to tell the world

yea..

So Im telling the world what happend to me today at
Foodland.

The store was packed and all the carts were being used
by the customers there. My roommate and I were both
hands full of groceries because there wasnt any
carts..

So. I finally see a cart, and my roommate dares me to
run after it so we can dump our goods into it. I didnt
run, but kinda rushed myself to get the cart. While
this is going on, I drop a gallon of milk and it hits
the side of a shelf..

The gallon bursts right open and splatters on this
chick from head to toe! I felt so bad, and helped get
the chick cleaned off atleast. BUT god damn im over
here telling the story to my other roommate and cant
stop laughing.

That incident straight happend like it was in a movie.
crazy....

Subject: {pb-cle} Hybrid

Not to rub it in to anyone who didn't get to make it, but wow!  A very 
awesome show, and if you didn't have a good excuse not to go then you 
really missed out.  The live act was phenomenal!  They really 
interacted well with the crowd which provided an awesome vibe.  Words 
cannot describe how great the music was.

But here are my complaints...

Peabody's need to get to their shit together.  Shady door guy charged 
$15 instead of the $12.  When I asked him about it he said that it was 
$12 presale and $15 at the door.  Bullshite!!  Plus they didn't have 
their sound together at all, it kept on skipping with the earlier acts. 
  When Hybrid went on you could hardly hear any vocals along with 
horrible feedback.  It really did not do them justice.  There were also 
some equipment problems from what I understand.  Oh, and you should 
have seen the ghetto set up for the decks.  Cinder blocks with sofa 
cushions?!

Nonetheless, great to see the people who made it out last night:  The 
Abbasso crew, Meghan, Chelsea, Ray, and Henry (hmmm.... someone was 
missing though :) perhaps slept the night away?)

My ears are still ringing (blah), and with 5 hrs. of sleep work is 
going to be so rough today (double blah).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Third Eye Facts

I dunno man....

Junglists wear a lot of camoflauge.

Dobermans were bred to like camoflauge specifically...almost a genetic 
committment to the "rough & tough", "toil & spoil", "droppin bombs" type of 
attitude.

It is almost as if Dobermans are junglists themselves.

My aunt had a Doberman once. That was one jaded animal.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Hybrid

Yes, Hybrid was totally amazing!  I had a great time for a Tuesday night.  I'm a bit sluggish this morning but I'll live.

The cushions under the tables are a new thang, so ghetto!  But at least it keeps the needle from skipping.  Yeah, Peabody's needs to get there shit together but I doubt things will improve there.  

Oh yeah, I love the lead singer!!  Okay Damon, I'll shut up about him.  Kidding!  :)

`'
`'Not to rub it in to anyone who didn't get to make it, but wow!  A very
`'awesome show, and if you didn't have a good excuse not to go then you
`'really missed out.  The live act was phenomenal!  They really
`'interacted well with the crowd which provided an awesome vibe.  Words
`'cannot describe how great the music was.
`'
`'But here are my complaints...
`'
`'Peabody's need to get to their shit together.  Shady door guy charged
`'$15 instead of the $12.  When I asked him about it he said that it was
`'$12 presale and $15 at the door.  Bullshite!!  Plus they didn't have
`'their sound together at all, it kept on skipping with the earlier
acts.
`'  When Hybrid went on you could hardly hear any vocals along with
`'horrible feedback.  It really did not do them justice.  There were
also
`'some equipment problems from what I understand.  Oh, and you should
`'have seen the ghetto set up for the decks.  Cinder blocks with sofa
`'cushions?!
`'
`'Nonetheless, great to see the people who made it out last night:  The
`'Abbasso crew, Meghan, Chelsea, Ray, and Henry (hmmm.... someone was
`'missing though :) perhaps slept the night away?)
`'
`'My ears are still ringing (blah), and with 5 hrs. of sleep work is
`'going to be so rough today (double blah).

Amazing show. I'm sorry to anyone who missed it. Dude, even the Grayarea guys were there!!!  Too bad they didn't want to play. And thanks to Naps for getting Barry Ashworth's drunk ass back up on the decks later :). He's a crazy focker! Hybrid's singer was pretty hot (though i was kinda partial to the bald one on bass)- Jen and I had a groupie moment when he waved at us gawking at him...I felt like we needed to throw our bras on stage or something, lol.
 
Awesome turnout in Cleveland on a Tuesday too. I even ran into some friends who came out from CMU and haven't seen in a while. Dean- Harry says we're coming to visit :
 
see everyone out on friday!

Yes, Hybrid was totally amazing! I had a great time for a Tuesday night. I'm a bit sluggish this morning but I'll live.

The cushions under the tables are a new thang, so ghetto! But at least it keeps the needle from skipping. Yeah, Peabody's needs to get there shit together but I doubt things will improve there. 

Oh yeah, I love the lead singer!! Okay Damon, I'll shut up about him. Kidding! :)

`'Not to rub it in to anyone who didn't get to make it, but wow! A very
`'awesome show, and if you didn't have a good excuse not to go then you
`'really missed out. The live act was phenomenal! They really
`'interacted well with the crowd which provided an awesome vibe. Words
`'cannot describe how great the music was.
`'
`'But here are my complaints...
`'
`'Peabody's need to get to their shit together. Shady door guy charged
`'$15 instead of the $12. When I asked him about it he said that it was
`'$12 presale and $15 at the door. Bullshite!! Plus they didn't have
`'their sound together at all, it kept on skipping with the earlier
acts.
`' When Hybrid went on you could hardly hear any vocals along with
`'horrible feedback. It really did not do them justice. There were
also
`'some equipment problems from what I understand. Oh, and you should
`'have seen the ghetto set up for the decks. Cinder blocks with sofa
`'cushions?!
`'
`'Nonetheless, great to see the people who made it out last night: The
`'Abbasso crew, Meghan, Chelsea, Ray, and Henry (hmmm.... someone was
`'missing though :) perhaps slept the night away?)
`'
`'My ears are still ringing (blah), and with 5 hrs. of sleep work is
`'going to be so rough today (double blah).

CBIK  THINK INSIDE THE BOX

FRIDAY, NOV. 21, 2003: INFUSION (live performance) : The Must-See Live
Electronic Act!

Honey Cbe:
Australian electronic live act INFUSION is heading back to our shores.  The
3-man phenomenon return after sensational reviews at the 2003 Winter Music
Conference, stunning accolades in their homeland, as well as in the UK,
Japan and at their live show at Buzzlife@Trust this past spring.  Ask anyone
who was at Trust that night  you definitely want to experience their
dynamically charged live performance.  As front man Jaime Stevens says,
when we play live, its about the energy.  With a mixture of synths,
vocals, breaks, house and big beats, their live music defies conventional
genres but can be accurately and simply classified as very energetic,
electronic dance music.

Subject: {pb-cle} Hybrid last night

Awesome vibe. Lots and lots of happy dancing people. Crowd and performers
feeding off each other. The way a good party should be!

Very very very very fun.

Strong performances by Hybrid. Nice mix of old and new material. Great
interludes by the DJs -- Barry Ashmore is crazy for the music and a
super-nice guy...that was class of him to lead the crowd into applause for
David (Deviant).

It was a success, despite the multitude of logistical difficulties beyond
our control that Peabody's presented...You guys don't even know what we had
to deal with, the ghettofabulous couch cushions being the least of it...

But all's well that ends well and it was a great time.

Props to Hybrid for making us a stop along the way,
Props to Grayarea for driving out from Chicago to pay respects to their
peers
Props to everyone who's sucking it up at work today (I'm right there with
ya)

Thanks everyone...

I'll have some photos posted at HeadRushMusic.com by the end of the week.

Does the $100 seating also come with liscense to
heckle oakenfold and sandra when they (inevitably)
screw up?  If I were idiotic enough to pay that much
I'd demand something more than the mere ability to
watch the trainwrecks as they happen.

Subject: {pb-cle} hybrid and this past weekend

so...
2 gripes from the PVD show posts but not directly related to  the show
1-NO good beer in Cleveland-(psst.. BYOB @ 3rd EYE)  well I went to the 
B-side Lounge(grog basement) on fri and they are working on having a very 
nice import beer selection-but it will need support to keep it growing
nice chill enviro w/ good music
2-no more live PAs
-well i think  cleve answered in good fashion
1st and foremost
THE TORTURED SOUL :
ABSO-FREAKIN-LUTELY MIND BLOWING!!!!!!!
for those that missed this one(boy did you ever!!!) make sure not to miss 
the next one and w/ this last turn-out and the incredible crowd response and 
good time had by ALL I'm sure there will be another!!
they ran the entire gambut of house and it was all excellant!!!
there was 2 sets so you could of done 2 things that nite like I did
---1st I went to see the newly renovated robin-hood for a GOAHEAD 
party(psst... another one this fri. don't miss it all the good stuff will be 
happening after Louie Vega anyway so hit em both!!!)
really kewl new MOBOLAZER at the Hood and some nice intlgnt scanners and 2 
projectors plus nice added Yorkie sound
So any CONTROL THE NIGHT event going on there in the future will be one not 
to be missed either
(don't know if GOAHEAD will do another there but it will be kewll too)
----2nd-HYBRID --the dif in price for entry is an issue that needs to be 
addressed---(atleast it was only an extra $1 and not $20 like other events)
great show  & great crowd response
for having like a week to put this thing together the turnout was pretty 
d**n good 150-200 ppl
I think they could have played a lil longer though
very nice equipment : Roalnd V-synth(whoooaa), Roland Jp-8000,Roland MC-909, 
2 korg tritons, nord lead rack, ms-2000 rack, Gibson Les Paul studio; yamaha 
Bass, & Yamaha Birch custom kit
the feedback was annoying and the sound could have been balanced better
-but hey thats what you get w/ sound guys who have been doin thrasherbands 
for 20 yrs
-----keep the sound guy to someone under 40 who still has fully functional 
eardrums!---
the crowd all had a geat time saw ppls from pbgh dragged some non EDM heads 
there too and they loved it
_HYbrid sold all there MERCH-so that is a good thing !
as for those couch cushions I think they were remnants from the 80s nite 
next door ;~)

- some ppl say the "RAVE" scene is dead
well the word "RAVE" might be dead but let me tell you the EDM community is 
alive strong and DANCING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
atleast at the places I'm going too
so if ya think your missin out go where I go!!!
I'll tell ya where I'll be this weekend
3rd EYE --4 SURE---!!!
and I'm tryin to sneak out to see Louie Vega too but shhh don't tell LUKE I 
know he 's not on this list(hehe)
1 last word B4 my lil box crushes from under me
"Love like you have never been hurt
Live like there is no tomorrow
work like you don't need money
& DANCE LIKE NOBODY IS WATCHING!"

Both of you are way too white. You'd be perfect together.

By the way, honey, this list is hardly "the world," in case you and your new
way-too-white boyfriend Tom hadn't figured it out yet.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} annabelles

I posted the wrong week last week for annnabell's, sorry I haven't been on 
top of things lately.  This week GLayze, Danger Mouse, and Two are spinning. 
Next week(night before Thanksgiving) I'll be spinning(either breaks or D&B, 
haven't decided yet), Lee, Simba, and maybe another if I get lucky.  The 
following week( december 3rd) Amy from Headrush is going to put on a show so 
make sure to check that out, I'm looking forward to it.  The rest of 
december I'm going to leave open for any dj to come down and spin on open 
tables.  Starting in January TSK (conspiracy, decepticon, mc infinity and a 
few others) and Unity (Lee, Skillz, and Chris Eberhart) are going to take 
over the night for me.  If anyone wants to get ahold of them about spinning 
down there just give me all your info and I'll make sure they get it. 
Hopefully they'll have enough energy to keep the night going for awhile 
longer.

Matt

Sleep? What's that? Not this weekend, anyway. First Third Eye, then the
Third Eye after-party, then Buffalo Saturday night. Sundays are for

The government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other, pays you =
for the milk, and then pours the milk down the drain.=20

AMERICAN CORPORATION=20
You have two cows.=20
You sell one, lease it back to yourself and do an IPO on the 2nd one. =
You force the two cows to produce the milk of four cows. You are =

You have two cows.=20
You go on strike because you want three cows.=20
You go to lunch and drink wine.=20
Life is good.=20

JAPANESE CORPORATION=20

GERMAN CORPORATION=20

The Mafia shows up and takes over however many cows you really have.=20

TALIBAN CORPORATION=20
You have all the cows in Afghanistan, which are two.=20
You don't milk them because you cannot touch any creature's private =
parts. Then you kill them and claim a US bomb blew them up while they =
were in the hospital.=20

IRAQI CORPORATION=20
You have two cows.=20
They go into hiding.=20
They send radio tapes of their mooing.=20

POLISH CORPORATION=20
You have two bulls.=20
Employees are regularly maimed and killed attempting to milk them.=20

CALIFORNIAN=20
You have a cow and a bull.=20
The bull is depressed.=20

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP - Cool, cheap infolines!


hello =] my name is kim.. some of you might know me, i'm a hyperreal
volunteer and have been subscribed to all the hyperreal lists at one point
or another because i like to travel. i'm a longtime music writer/website
admin/bedroom dj/gathering facilitator/dancesafe volunteer/music law
activist etc. blah blah blah.

i'm now working at a telcom, so i figured i'd torment all of you by
spamming you about infolines. i did put blatant self promotion in the
subject line in case that's still a filter.. i know it is on the northwest
raves list. anyway, here's the spam: the company i work for has really
cheap voicemail numbers that are great for infolines. they also take
faxes, which makes them cool for promoters because booking agents can fax
you over dj contracts, etc. there are local numbers in most area codes and
also toll free numbers. you can get custom numbers too, like
1-800-LUV-TKNO.
you can listen to the voicemail/view the faxes online and it can notify
you when you get one to an email address, cellphone text messaging
address, or pager. it also keeps a list of everyone who's ever called. if
you want more info on the specifics of this.. email me! :)

if you want to hear what it sounds like, i run a number called the seattle
techno infoline.. it lists all upcoming electronic music events here. it's
not specific to any one promoter or club, but it'd give you an idea
anyway.. 206.686.3151. :D

</ spam>. sorry. *spanks self* i know you hate me now. but you are free at
last! no more from me! it's over! it makes everything else seem much
better in comparison!

for anyone who made it this far, i also wanted to add two non-spam related
things:

1) if any of you use soulseek for file sharing and are into microhouse,
detroit techno, deep/tech house, idm, indie rock, hiphop, etc.. add
'groovinkim' to your list and trade with me!
2) if there's a damn good large-scale event coming up, i want to know
about it. in the past few years i've travelled to atlanta, chicago,
detroit,
barcelona, vancouver, berlin, amsterdam, paris, san francisco, etc. for
events and want an excuse to do so again. this year i may skip demf for
mutek but will definitely return to sonar.. (http://www.sonar.es - you
should go to this or die trying.) add somewhere else to my list! heh.

like you really care who this person is that's spamming you with this
massive email, but if you are curious, here are some of my sites:
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/nw
http://www.nwtekno.org
http://www.seattletechno.com

i'm not always evil, just on wednesdays. ;)

i had a great time and hybrid was fantastic.  i wish i would have been able to stay later to catch all the djs but from what i know it was a great night.  thanks for the good times

"Amy Dana (HeadRush Music)" <amy@headrushmusic.com> wrote:Awesome vibe. Lots and lots of happy dancing people. Crowd and performers
feeding off each other. The way a good party should be!

Very very very very fun.

Strong performances by Hybrid. Nice mix of old and new material. Great
interludes by the DJs -- Barry Ashmore is crazy for the music and a
super-nice guy...that was class of him to lead the crowd into applause for
David (Deviant).

It was a success, despite the multitude of logistical difficulties beyond
our control that Peabody's presented...You guys don't even know what we had
to deal with, the ghettofabulous couch cushions being the least of it...

But all's well that ends well and it was a great time.

Props to Hybrid for making us a stop along the way,
Props to Grayarea for driving out from Chicago to pay respects to their
peers
Props to everyone who's sucking it up at work today (I'm right there with
ya)

Thanks everyone...

I'll have some photos posted at HeadRushMusic.com by the end of the week.

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is

LITTLE LOUIE VEGA
FRIDAY NOVEMBER 21
CLEVELAND


.:Wish Nightclub is proud to present Dance Ritual featuring Little Louie
Vega:.

**

Little Louie Vega will be headlining on Friday November 21st at Wish's
"Reintroducing Wish Party".

Little Louie" Vega is the Miles Davis of dance music. Like the impossible
to categorize Davis, Vega is constantly reinventing himself and
revolutionizing music itself in the process. During his nearly two-decade
long career, Vega has crafted some of the most innovative singles in dance
music history ("The Nervous Track", "It's Alright", "I Feel It" and "You
Can Do It"), kick started genres like soulful house ("Beautiful People,"
"I Get Lifted"), and revitalized the careers of legends like Roy Ayers,
George Benson and Tito Puente.

Rob Black will be warming up the tables and dance floor as he is back to
his old legendary residency on Friday nights. Also, let's not forget about
Mike Metz in the Martini Bar spinning great soulful house lounge music.

We have just recently put in an Arabica coffee bar for that late night
pick me up...or that early on espresso martini!

Please come out to what should be an unbelievable night.

Pre-sale ticket info and pricing details to follow...

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE

Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each
other.  These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we
danced all night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower
ourselves as one tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the
power of these sites was released into our bodies, giving us strength and
connecting us to Gaia.  Then the religions of fear took hold. They
destroyed our sacred sites and our rituals, burning all who dared to
question. But the power could not be suppressed forever and the great
cycles of time have brought us full circle to this new moment and we
gather once again. The ancient memory has been reawakened, the all night
dance ritual has returned. We are once again experiencing the mystical
power of the Trance.

Twister in te past 10 years. He consistently treads where other dj's fear 
to go, his techno electro fusion has made jaws drop from Buzz to Firestone 
to Twilo here in the states, and his residencies have made clubs 
legendary. He is standing firm currently in DJMixed.com/BPM's Top 100 and 
ready to show Buffalo what underground dance music is all about!


Xotec .. Buffalo/NY The godfather of Buffalo's underground dance scene. We 
all know him, and we all love him. No top 40, no bubblegum techno, just a 
turntable master doing what he does best, energizing the dancefloor and 
taking control of the vibe!

Bugz in the Attic are a new generation 9 member collective based in

to create their individual sound. Scratch the surface of the broken beats
and you'll find fresh thinking on drum n bass, house, hip hop, soul,
techno and dancehall. Their label Bitasweet is a home for all the Bugz
sounds, their essential remixes and individual projects. Bugz have
produced acts as diverse as The Ends, New Sector Movements, Neon Phusion,
Homecookin' and the vocal talents of Corrina Joseph, Alison David, Shola
Ama.  Remixes include the classic re-work of 4Hero's 'Hold It Down', the
sublime Viktor Duplaix 'Lookin For Love' and Macy Gray 'When I See You'.
They have most recently mixed a FABRICLIVE compilation and the plan for
2004 is Bugz in the Attic's first artist album. They DJ in London at their
own 'Got The Bug' night, Co Op and FABRICLIVE. This year they played at

Lol.

Honestly when are people going to get it. Its not the medium nor is it a
beat matching contest. Nor do I or any dj I know feel it necessary to
prove his beat matching skills.

Its about the symphony, the orchestra, the story....

Bah

This is a useless conversation. Either you get or you don't.

Its about the vibe. If you can create it with wax, cd's, mp3's then
great. The idea is to get lost and dance. If I have to be concerned
about what tools the dj is using then I am there for the wrong reason. I
guess your either there to dance or trainspot. The more time a dj has to
present the music in a creative way and the less time he has to deal
with Flexing his beat matching skills the better.

No I go specically to bitch if I'm not satisfied. I might be a Tom Cox in
the making. Eeeeek. :-p

But ur right I don?t care if the djs using 3 tables 2 cd players and a drum
machine, or jest 2 cd players. If the track selection is on and the mixes
are fairly obscure, im happy. Granted, Im excluding hard house as being "on"
type of chune selection.

With a denon, we are all a Ritchie Hawtin waiting to be released from his or
her coocoon. All you need to do is hit play.

Lovely machine. And poo on Moose and Darw_n - I told them 2 years ago that
turntables would soon be obsolete and that live digital mixing would take
over.

This Denon has just about everything I hoped to see, as well:

+ A virtual turntable mechanism that simulates the look and feel of a real
DD turntable.

+ Fully CD and Mp3 capable

And it's only going to get better. Eventually what I hope to see is the
hybridization of tools like this new Denon with PC-based mixing solutions
like PCDJ. The interface will look, feel, and behave like a traditional (2
turntables and a mixer) setup but there will be no records. Integrated into
the system will be in essence, a computer with an operating system and a
unique file browser specifically designed to this application. Tracks will
be sorted and resorted by BPM, genre, mood, whatever - the attributes can be
user defined all the way down to country of origin and beyond into realms
which are totally subjective such as "color" or "intensity". And all of this
data is stored on a high-speed low-error USB hard drive which is the
deejay's only luggage. These systems will be standardized so that anywhere
there's a universal virtual turntable system, you can post up, plug in, and
rock out. The drives will be chainable for 7-way tag team madness and all
sorts of other chaos.

a hard disk like this one:
http://www.archos.com/products/prw_500455.html

a visual interface like this one:
http://www.pcdj.com/Images/ProductImgs/Scrns/FX_L.jpg

and a tactile interface like this one:
http://redirx.com/?9uz

It would be fucking trick.

im telling you, its pretty far off still. and i think most setupes
will continue to support vinyl as well for a good long while. as
for computer interfaces, im still not too sure. a simple dedicated
CD player is still infinite times more reliable than any computer
is. CDs are pretty convenient, especially if youre putting MP3s on
them. i think the future will be 2 direct drive platttered CD
players (im assuming those ill technics will become standard when
theyre introduced) alongside 2 1200's in most places. i just dont
see the computer technology being stable enough. if the current
reliance on technics is any indication, im betting that "Advances"
in computer interfaces will be as useless as "advances" in
turntables that no one uses. its gotta be all about simplicity and
sturdiness. computers just dont have that. id love to just be able
to fill up my 255 CD book and take it to gigs. that shit is
sooooooooooo light.

A computer interface would be nice... digging for music would take a 
keystroke. I agree about simplicity and sturdiness...but needles skip more 
than computers crash, and both make me equally as livid.

...obviously a skipping needle would be MUCH less disastrous than a computer 
crashing...

Vinyl is just cooler than anything else to begin with. The feel of it under 
your finger tips as well as the luxury of actually being able to see your 
music beats anything else (and lets not forget about homage and tradition!)

...although in some cases the venue is too dark to see your record, and I'm 
sure there will be an interface that emulates the appearance of vinyl.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

I've seen pics of http://www.numark.com/news/releases/index.php?n=85

and it is awesome. I just hope numark comes through with it right. If 
they do, it'll be a denon destroyer.

BTW, Pioneer does have software out that does what you suggest Josh. It 
works with their digital media players and there are hidden 
downloadable movies on how it works at the pioneer pro dj site ( I 
found them once, can't now ). You just carry around the smart media 
card or secure digital or wtf ever card and that's it. It looks pretty 
p1mp, but looks like major capital investment.

being compared to tom cox isnt all that bad of a gig, it just implies that
you know a little bit about music and talk endlessly about obscure shit that
is 'hot'.  it's entertaining, yes, but about as educational as watching MTV
Road Rules.

talking shit on hard house is too easy. to really be like me, you
have to talk shit on universally loved artists (richie hawtin)
while at the same time bigging up universally hated artists
(justin timberlake). after that, youve gotta run for mayor of
pittsburghwith the campaign slogan "dude, that shit is wack." plus
youve gotta be the most controversial person ever. 

until then, good luck.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} denon dn-s5000

well i have to chime in here and say that i do care
what the dj is using, i mean i wanna know if he's
using gear that takes effort and finesse, or even
talent to use, or equipment that makes it easy for
him. if a guy s rocking but just playing songs he's
not really rocking. like when i go to see a "live pa"
and it's just a guy playing songs from his album off a
laptop, maybe tweaking out one part, that's probly
gonna make me leave, and try not to see said
"performer" again.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} denon dn-s5000

that's the beauty of me using the computer...

when i use a track and i'm done with it, it's always in the same place when i go to look for it
again.

plus, it's infinitely helpful to be able to have two of the same track playing simultaneously.

vinyl is great. i love it. i want more and more and more of it, no doubt. but i'm also pragmatic
enough to know that there are other things out there with different and more reliable features.

A computer interface would be nice... digging for music would take a
keystroke. I agree about simplicity and sturdiness...but needles skip more
than computers crash, and both make me equally as livid.

...obviously a skipping needle would be MUCH less disastrous than a computer
crashing...

Vinyl is just cooler than anything else to begin with. The feel of it under
your finger tips as well as the luxury of actually being able to see your
music beats anything else (and lets not forget about homage and tradition!)

...although in some cases the venue is too dark to see your record, and I'm
sure there will be an interface that emulates the appearance of vinyl.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

A solidly built dedicated machine isn't going to crash often. If ever. I
have several machines that have not crashed in over a month of non-stop
operations.

Vinyl does of a slick feel to it but I can get over that. As far as
seeing your music. It would be far more to my advantage to look at a
tracks waveform then the light / dark grooves of vinyl :)

well i have to chime in here and say that i do care
what the dj is using, i mean i wanna know if he's
using gear that takes effort and finesse, or even
talent to use, or equipment that makes it easy for
him. if a guy s rocking but just playing songs he's
not really rocking. like when i go to see a "live pa"
and it's just a guy playing songs from his album off a
laptop, maybe tweaking out one part, that's probly
gonna make me leave, and try not to see said
"performer" again.

i have 2 turntables that in 6 years have never crashed or needed
rebooting. that is the kind of solid performance that computers
just cant handle. computers are mostly more fragile than technics
as well, so youd have to worry double about it crashing as well as
it taking actual physical damage more easily than a rock solid
turntable.

  I'm going to Wish and the Third Eye.  We'll prolly cab it from O2 to Wish and back again.  Don't wanna deal with Flats traffic, plus cabbing it prolly costs the same as parking in the Warehouse district.  I'm staying as far away from Metropolis as I can!!   I can't wait for tonight!!!  :)

Do you think you explain a little bit more about those benefits?

I am interested in how different people manipulate two copies of the same 
track......anybody else feel free to chime in as well!

What a horrible night to have a curse.

i dont know what kind of needles you use, but i never have
problems with my tables and needles which i set up. obviously when
you get tons of bass shaking your shit at a gig, things can
change, but even still a needle skipping is minor. 

>...obviously a skipping needle would be MUCH less disastrous than
a computer 
>crashing...

yeah thats the other main argument. restarting a computer takes a
couple minutes. that can be so annoying in the middle of a set i
bet. i can remember one really fun set ratana and i were spinning
at some rave. in the middle of the drop of one of the best tunes
we played, the sound cut out. it was out for a couple minutes, and
in that time all the vibe was totally lost. id have traded a
skipping needle for that in a heartbeat.

im a vinyl guy. ive been buying records for most of my life, with
only maybe 4 years in there (90-94 or so) that it wasnt the medium
i bought most. for something to lure me away from it, it would
have to be damn good, and im just not seeing it yet. i did see an
ad for the new pioneer cdj1000mk2s. they give you a little spot to
follow as it spins to facilitate beat juggling and that kind of
stuff. thats a good step. the price just isnt right for them right
now, its way too high for nearly anyone i know to justify spending
$2000 for how much they spin and get paid for doing so and how
much theyve already spent on their existing setup. maybe for
someone who is just starting out itll be a different story, but
for those who are established and who arent superstars, its damn
pricey. 

>...although in some cases the venue is too dark to see your

>sure there will be an interface that emulates the appearance of
vinyl.

ovbiously final scratch already utilizes the vinyl interface.

I was referring to a graphical representation of your record based on the 
wavelength model, not the piece of plastic itself...

Heheh.  True that, but still, MP3's don't skip when they get old.  I still
want that Vestax vinyl-cutter to come down in price...

drooooool.....

yeah, $10G's is a bit steep, plus upkeep on the sapphire cutting head. i forget what the figure for
replacement was, something around 20 hours. that's not a whole lot of plates before having to sink
another $500....

mp3's don't skip, but hard drives wear out.
especially when you're taking them on the go, they get a little more wear
and tear than your desktop pc that stays in the same place all the time.

Laptops, in my experience, wear about as well as vinyl.  However, when the
laptop wears out, it's easily replaced...  Dunno.  The Panasonic
Toughbooks are just mad cool.

http://www.panasonic.com/computer/toughbook

Dunno.  Laptops with sealed (moisture/dust resistant) metal cases, shock
mounted harddrives, anti-glare outdoor screens, backlit keyboard.

Designed for Police cars, fire battallion chiefs, EMT triage stations,
military, etc.

This: http://www.panasonic.com/computer/toughbook/learn_more_tb34.asp
combined with Final Scratch would be the shit.  :)

Those are pretty hardcore, they make them for the cable industry and
they're meant for techs to be taking levels and such in the
rain/snow/fuck storms. Just WAAAAAAAY pricey. 

That's still too many parts me thinks (laptop/fs/etc). I'll wait for the
Numark self-contained FS alike, or just use Traktor. The only problem is
that Traktor 2.51 blows goats, it's been nearly impossible for me to
sync it with my wax, although it now syncs with midi gear which is
pretty darn cool. 

Hmm. Decks with FS built in. Now that would be nifty.

I wanna go home already.

I would like to know this as well.  Maybe you can do three table action

cd decks or something?  Or you can "scratch" with one and match it to

Mp3 are shit for mixing they hard on cpu's even beefy ones. And can
cause cpu spikes which would not be good "if you where in the mix"

You would still by vinyl anyways. It has a better range of sound then
digital. You would just rip your shit to the pc. Then keep your wax new.

Heheh.  True that, but still, MP3's don't skip when they get old.  I
still want that Vestax vinyl-cutter to come down in price...

drooooool.....

yeah, $10G's is a bit steep, plus upkeep on the sapphire cutting head. i
forget what the figure for replacement was, something around 20 hours.
that's not a whole lot of plates before having to sink another $500....

well, my baby was all right last night.  It was parked right next to 
a BMW and an AUDI.  so anyone that wants to mess up stuff would have 
gone for one of those :)  btw, thanks for all "hows the ride" 
comments last night.  Thought everyone ignored me here :)

btw, party was tight, Luc always throws killer parties, I'll post the 
pics sometime tonight when i get around to it and after I go through 
all the drunken pics I took of Jes, wait, she's always drunk :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Little Louie Vega pics.

http://littlelouievega.properdj.com/

Here is my review from another message board for the weekend:

What a great night. It is so cool that Cleveland was able to support four
QUALITY events.

I didn't make it over to Metropolis because my friends didn't make it in
until really late. Had I known Vega was playing late I would have been able
to.

I also wanted to stop by Third Eye, but had to miss that as well. I
understand it was good times and went well.

I stopped @ Moda for a few to drop some people off. Sammy O was rocking the
room and Rap blew it up. It was really busy and there was a bit of a line
when I left.

Louie Vega was amazing. What a treat. I've got about 70 pics I'll post
later. He opened with my favorite record of the year... "Back Together" by
Hardsoul ft Ron Carrol. He had that dancefloor at Wish packed and people
with their hands in the air all night. Mike Metz handled the opening
duties... and a lot of people commented on it how good it was. Good job
Mike! This event brought together many different people from many different
backgrounds and it was refreshing to see that. Black, White, Older, Younger,
Gay, Straight, Ravers, Latin, European... all coming together in the spirt
of house :)

Other musical hilights for me: Promised Land always gives me chills.
Layering the accapella from "That's House" over top of "I feel Love" was
also nice. Its one of those shout-out records and his name is included in
it. Julie McKnight's "Finally" got everyone stomping and clapping and
singing along... just as a true house party should be. His mid set was more
tribal and edgier... a perfect way to balance out the classics and anthems.
OH... I almost forgot... CHICAGO'S STREETPLAYER... AHHHH! That's the track
that "the bomb" sampled. And nuespeed... the reason the mix wasn't
completely perfect was because it was a live drummer on that track and live
beats are not as exact as midi sequenced ones.

Also, nitelifegod, I wasn't there for the soundsystem going out but Hardman
is doing the sound there. Not being negative, but as an honest criticism the
"music" was sacrificed at the expense of thumping bass and the beauty of the
lyrics, strings, and other instrumentation had a hard time showing through.
There were times when Louie was layering accapellas that only those paying
really close attention could hear. Its the same complaint I've had with a
couple other places. I've noticed even some of the larger concerts I've
attended in Cleveland have the same shortcomings. I think the masses just
like it loud and miss out on so much else the music has to offer.

All in all a great evening everywhere. Let's keep this thing going!

Subject: {pb-cle} The Third Eye - Review

I haven't had this much fun at a party in months and months. It was
wonderful seeing SO MANY people I haven't seen in the longest time!!! (The
Kenyon college crew was there! - Mary and Jamie, it's always a pleasure!)

Honestly, this felt like a real, old-fashioned vibey *RAVE*.

The after-party was also a blast (no broken wine glasses!), although I
went into major anti-social mode after 'prolonged socializing' got the
better of me (can we say, I 'shocked and horrified' my boy by becoming
glued to the computer for hours, and hours, and hours ... a scary thing
for those who haven't witnessed the phenomenom before). Met some great
people tonight who I hope to run into again soon (John and Brandy, Grant,
hippies dude who had some scary fucking FILTH FEET, haha). I can't list
everyone's name because I'll forget people, and I'm still tired as fuck.
It was just a kickass happy, friendly, drama-free event.

Thank you to Luke! Thanks to Chelsea and Moose (these guys donated WAY
more time behind the bar than I ever could) and everyone else!

Amanda

Crazy fun! So cool to see so many familiar faces out and meet up a few new
heads off the list and otherwise. Shame John (product 19) missed his
timeslot, but Uzi filled it nicely, and was some great psy all fawkin night.

It's too bad Paul was even more narcoleptic then ussual, as the beers he
drank didn?t help much in keeping him up. Sorry bout that, the pics explain
all. :-p 

Stuck around Trouts afterwards for a little while, I should stayed a little
bit later but was super tired. Headed off as the Goahead crew came.

Shouts to the cats I can remember seeing: Colin, John (P 19) and his friend,
sidtrackked katz from PGH, Trout, MethylAmanda, Dave, Reese, Ross and
friends, Aaron, Jamie Tyler and Valerie, Andy James and Lindsey, Moose,
mayne some more people (sorry yo), and course the whole Goahead crew and
thanks for a fun time: Luke, Meghan, Cris, Moke, Emily, Sam, etc et all

Still recooperating,
alex

yeah that track is the hotness. it was on LLV's one recent double

sounding one sided pressing that made me really really happy.

>beats are not as exact as midi sequenced ones.

i realised something the other night. only the most boring shit
that sounds exactly the same can easily be beatmatched. if people
even put different amounts of swing on their hi hats, beatmatching
is going to not sound right. for genres like jungle, broken beat,
and 2-step, the differences in beat patterns can be so great that
even mixes that are flawlessly in time with each other will sound
like sneakers in the dryer. so what ends up happening in those
genres is that most deejays will restrict themselves to beat
patterns that line up really easily, essentially sacrificing
variety for a "tightly" mixed set. and for the most part in my
experience it seems that people seem to eat it up. i just dont
understand when mixes became more important than good songs and
the vibe you get from good songs. 

mixing disco records is without question one of the most difficult
things you can try, especially mixing them with each other. two
live drummers each drifting in opposite or similar directions at
different rates........argh. 

anyway, im jealous that i didnt get to see LLV.

Okay, I know this is a little late, but here's my review:

I had a blast!! :)  Great vibe all night.  The place filled up earlier than I 
expected which was nice.  Did a lot of socializing and dancing all night.  Met 
a couple people from South Bend, IN, and I guess there was a guy from Michigan 
there as well.  A couple of mine and Luke's friends from NYC came out as well.

The only complaint that I have about the event is the drummers.  They were over 
powering the DJs.  I know Moke had a hard time hearing during his set because 
of them.  If they weren't playing right in front of the DJ booth, it would've 
been okay.  Emily & Chirs asked them to move and they did, but it wasn't long 
before they were back up front again.  But it's all good...still had a very 
good time. :)

Yeah....the drummers...

They were a little off, if that wasn?t it I wouldn?t have minded as much. To
top that, when the dj requests they go somewhere else, I think its key that
they GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Nice vibe that they gave the place, but if it is a
prob with the main elements it shouldve been adjusted.

yeah, although i agree with lukem it's about the vibe
and people participating, it's also nice if they have
better rhythm, and if they respect the dj's wishes
too. but whatever. i can see both sides. my biggest
gripe with the drummers is that they always play
constantly, i wish they would give it a rest
sometimes. i think there's a reason that every edm
track doesn't have drums in it. it's like with emcees
too, they always overdo it. just my 2 cents tho. still
the party rocked and i like to see enthusiastic people
at them, drums or no. good stuff

Anyone find a battery-glowstick...drunk girl dropped one of her good ones.  <what a geek--I swear I'm not candy...really, honest.>
 
Now that I'm a little more awake, it 'twas nice seeing everyone and meeting some new faces.  Meghan and Chris, Steph and Tommie, Jen and Damon, Bridget, Reese, Luke, Boompsie, Amanda, Alex, Trout, Moke, Moose& Chelsea (who were such troopers...I think I was a slob and left stuff everywhere...sowwy.)etc..and sorry to all I miss. 
 
I wish I'd have talked more and danced less...but then again, it was still fun. 
 
Yep, def. looking forward to the next one, and great pics guys~~too bad I forgot about my camera sitting in my bag all night.

of them. If they weren't playing right in front of the DJ booth, it would've

Alright, I do have one gripe...i forgot about the
drummers...I'm not sure if it was the acoustics of the
place or their 'interpretations' but as I was sitting
at the bar during moke's set a lot of their drumming
was eerily reminiscent of shoes in the dryer.

welll well well....

back in the burgh and rested (finally) so let's begin.


third eye was a total blast, so cool hangning out in
cleveland with all the ohio ppl i never get to see!
really i felt totally at home as though it was my
regular crowd. music was great, i don't usually get
into psytrance, but uzi, kri and blue spectral monkey
all played some really good shit. the latter two
played alot of stuff that was basically hard minimal
techno, so so so nice to be surprised!!how i cherish
that! moke also played some real tasty
tribalhouse/techno/funky goodness at the end. very
lovely. good vibe too, enthusisatic people having fun.
isn't that the point? 

enormous thanks and blessings to luke (of course, you
rock), trout/dave/amanda for putting us up and puting
up with us, moose and chelsea (definitely troopers)
all the djs (nice to meet you moke and ross), andy and
lindsey for the beers, jes for the beers (and for
waiting around for me), john and brandy for the beers
and the ride back, and awesome to see everyone...todd,
sherry and jesse, jenny (nice to meet you!), catherine
(nice to meet you!), reese (nice to meet you), meghan
(nice to meet you finally, wish you were spinning!),
ray, alex (nice ride man!), and everybody else i can't
remember right now...i'm surprised i remembered so
many! all in all a great weekend.

hope to see everybody again soon!

Yes, what a fun night!!  Though it was hell trying to wake up 11am.  But I 
had to watch the big game!  

It was so nice to go to a rave again, it had been ages since I've done that.  
Though I did hurt my wrist trying to dance with those big glowing sticks or 
whatever they were, I was obviously drunk trying to do that!   

Nice to see Abbasso peeps out and about.  

Colin, it was nice meeting ya too and I look forward to hearing ya spin next 
year in Cleveland!  

Alex, luved the Oakenfold shirt!  

Thanks goahead for making this happen!

Buy them a bath? I take it you were planning on driving them through the car wash in the back of a pick up truck. Good idea. That should get *most* of the dirt off.

Subject: {pb-cle} long, great weekend is over...

Well I know I speak for Luke (currently snoring away
on the couch) in saying that the weekend went far, far
better than we had hoped. Everyone who helped, donated
gear, played, danced, chilled, etc. deserves mad
respect and appreciation. Extra special thanks to
Chris (Kri) and  Christian (Blue Spectral Monkey) for
coming up and being a blast to hang with. Those 2 just
rocked it all over the place from the Flats to
Cuyahoga Falls and then over to Euclid on Saturday
night for what to me was the highlight of the weekend
and one of the best times I've had in forever. Sat.
night was just flat out amazing, all of you who
toughed it out and dragged thier asses out know what I
mean. The music was just so on point all night.
Boompsie straight rocked it. The chill stuff Christian
played at the end was so damn perfect. The vibe was
even tighter than the night before which is hard to
believe. OK, gotta wake homeboy up and take him home,
then reaquaint myself with my bed for many, many
hours. Great pics so far... should have a huge batch
myself from both nights up by midweek. Again, thanks
everyone for the past couple days, I hope you all had
as good a time as I.

TITONTON DUVANTE
Residual. Neroli. 2000 Black. Jazzanova Compost.

With 19 tours of Europe under his belt and two more planned before the end
of the year, Titonton Duvant? continues to expand his reputation as an
innovator and a Columbus based ambassador of electronic music to the world.
Mr. Duvant? has released over 40 releases, including two full length albums,
on labels such as UK based 2000 Black and Visions, as well as the Italian
label Archive, and his own Residual Recordings, to name just a few.  He has
recently been signed to BitaSweet, the Bugz in the Attic label based in
London, and his first release on the label entitled "Hentai" will be
released in the coming weeks.  He also recently joined the Jazzanova Compost
label artist roster with his blazing remix of "Let it go," the second single
off of the Rima album "This World."  The coming months will further Mr.
Duvante?s reputation as a prolific producer as he unleashes release after
release on a variety of labels including "explicit" on Neroli, and "Raunchy"
on Project.  His collaboration with longtime friend and fellow producer John
Tejada entitled "Passing Through" will also be released on the respected
Amalgama label including a remix by Alex Attias.  His debut solo album, the
"Voyeurism" LP, originally released in 1999 on France?s Starbaby Records, is
being re-released on CD featuring 4 new tracks.  He is currently hard at
work on his third full length album, "Perversions."
His rare live performance of Melodic Techno and Brokenbeat will feature all
new and unreleased work.  He will be accompanied by the live percussion of
Ill Atmospherics? and Charles Cooper Quartet drummer Don Carlos.

FBK
Sleep Engineering. Frictional Records. 21/22 corp.

Kevin Kennedy has been involved in Columbus' electronic music scene since
1991, and has been perfoming since 1994 under various pseudonyms including
POWERHOUSE and the Sleep Engineer.  He has performed and recorded with many
artists including Daniel Bell, Anthony 'Shake' Shakir and Jay Denham.  His
sound has evovled from his diverse roots in hip-hop, performing in local
band Poets of Heresy, playing in rock and punk bands, and also exploring the
territories of jazz.  On what he is calling his "last performance," Kevin
will be performing an eclectic set  running the gamut from hip-hop to hard
techno.

Subject: {pb-cle} Goahead Thanks!

Thanks everyone who made it out to The Third Eye.
I was really impressed with the divers crowd.
I know some people have mixed thoughts on hippies
and drummers and they have been noted. The hippies
are my friends, and they helped us throw another
great party at the Gallery cafe on Saturday night.
I can't do much about your perception on smells, 
but I can advise drummers to set up away from the 
dj dance area next time. There just wasn't enough
LSD around to make everything fuse properly but
other than that I thought the vibe was pretty
tight. I personally love the energy drummers create
and to me it is about so much more than keeping 
a beat. It's about getting closer to Gaia. It was
great to see people still dancin hard at 5:00 a.m
Thanks to all who gave their time and effort to help
make this a great weekend. Moose, AA, Chelsea, Reese,
Alex, VR, Trout, Sidetrakkt, Touchsamadhi, Meghan,
Sid, Colin, Product 19, UZI, Moke, Monkey, Kri,
all the Goahead crew.

I plan on doing a few other themes with the Third Eye series.
The next one will be about percussion bass and acid.
in January will not have as much of a psychedelic
flavor. Titonton, Boompsie, Andy James, Ratana are 
next up. Saturday April 24th is the Butterfly dance ritual
with the Breakbeat militia, Gavin, UZI, The Funk Detective,
and a psytrance international headliner t.b.a.

Peace,
Luke

<<Mp3 are shit for mixing they hard on cpu's even beefy ones. And can cause cpu spikes which would

Have you ever actually tried this to know what you're talking about?

I've been doning it for four years and never, EVER had any of these "spikes" you're talking about,
nor have I had any more trouble matching MP3's to each other or to vinyl.

<<It has a better range of sound then digital.>>

How so? Most underground music made today is recorded digitally...the only analog stage is when it's
actually put onto the vinyl. In four years of weekly use on many and various systems, a well
encoded, high quality (192k or above bitrate) mp3 has proven to be indistinguishable from cd or
vinyl 99.99% of the time.

So yeah, there goes that theory. Next?

I'll bite.

Yes. I've been using Traktor for years on PC and now Mac, and have
experienced all sorts of CPU spikes -- mostly during transitions and
times I really don't want them to happen. The audio keeps on playing,
but the interface totally locks up for a few seconds, usually just long
enough to toally fuck up any meat batching going on. Reason to use an
external mixer I guess. 

With Traktor 2.51, performance has gone to crap. They introduced time
stretching, and it all went to hell. It's almost like they're really
stretching time and I'm not supposed to notice the whole interface slows
down. 

Ok, that's just one app. How about when my Ableton Live disk usage
spikes and all you hear is static? Does it for no reason sometimes...
probably just disk swaps interfering with the Ableton disk streaming. 

I really don't equate it to anything different than my arm cramping up
when I play my upright, a record skipping, or whatever. Have a drum
machine handy, spin your bass, or give a shout to the crowd or
something. Whatever works. I guess that's the difference between a DJ
and a creative performer.

No I just like talking at my ass. Yes I did a series of tests using
traktor dj studio. Playing from one drive (7200 rpm with 8mb cache) and
recording to separate drive. This was on a 1.7gh p4 with 1024 mb ram.
Maybe you where using some toy software like pcdj or something. Maybe
you where just smashing tracks together. I however like to use other
programs for effects or whatever I want as well as record my mix at the
same time. All of these things take resources. The mp3 when played
caused spikes especially when seeking or loading a track. So load up
your little resource meter. Load up your software and check it out
yourself.

Ummm let just do this the basic way..... Digital is by definition a 1 or
a 0. With analog you can have any infinite number between one and zero.
A new vinyl recording is capable of nuances in sound that you will not
have with an a digital copy. A wav file is a very close representation
more so then an mp3. An mp3 in decoded on the fly. So it is more taxing
on the machine then just ripping through a wave file. So lets say you
through down a set of 192k mp3s. You also recording your set. What
happens when you compress the sound of your already compressed tracks.
Maybe you can't hear a difference or maybe you don't care. 

>So yeah, there goes that theory. Next?
Its not a theory. Why don't you spend an hour or so on the net and look
the shit up. Before running your mouth.


For the record I was the one all for dj'ing with a digital media. I was
just letting everyone know they where better off doing this with a wav
file then an mp4 file for more reasons then I listed above.

I use an external mixer and was having similar issues until I started
using all wav files. Cleared this right up. Also check your latency

That's what I heard I am sticking with 2.1 until they work out the bugs.
Ok, that's just one app. How about when my Ableton Live disk usage
spikes and all you hear is static? Does it for no reason sometimes...
probably just disk swaps interfering with the Ableton disk streaming.

Well, the frequency response of vinyl is far less than digital.  Lets say
you have a 24 bit digital master.  It will sound much, much clearer, than
when it is mastered to vinyl.  Vinyl mastering actually involves
re-orienting the sound spatially so that it can be read by a needle
without the needle jumping out of the grooves, and pretty much that is an
art form that first attempts to make it sound as close to the master as
possible, and then, if the engineer feels like it, makes any adjustments
to make it sound "warmer" or "better" or "louder" etc.  Which is why
getting something mastered at different places will make a difference.

Yes surface noise, turntable rumble, etc can certainly add flavor to a
vinyl recording as it is being played, but the frequency response is much
much less than a CD, or even a 192k mp3.  The amount of "possible" sound
from vinyl therefore is less. I really think you are wrong here with your
argument.

For me, I absolutely love vinyl and would never play things on cd, or with
mp3 out, unless it was my own tunes or my friends tunes that aren't on
vinyl yet.  The complaint people have against cds, and specifically some
rock artists when they hear stuff "remastered" on cd, is that the cds are
TOO clear, TOO perfect.  With clarity, there is less warmth.  With
clarity, you hear more mistakes and more detail that might have better
been left "fuzzy."  Of course if you are listening to classical music you
probably want it to be as clear as possible, being that a classical
concert doesnt have amps and distortion pedals on everyones instruments.

Vinyl is great, and I love it, and I think it sounds better than CD for a
lot of things, for the reasons mentioned above, but I would never try to
argue that it has a better frequency response or sounds clearer or more
accurate than a CD.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} denon dn-s5000

<<No I just like talking at my ass>>

Heh. You're right. Sorry. I hadn't had my coffee yet and my reply to you came out way bitchier than
I intended. Seriously, i'm sorry...No personal offense was intended. It was a long weekend.

<<Yes I did a series of tests using traktor dj studio.>>

Then perhaps you need to take umberage with the software, not the format or the hardware you're
using.

I've been using PCDJ (the "toy" software, as you put it ;-) ) for about three years and it's been
extremely solid in regards to real-time playing and tweaking. (I had some crap program prior, not
worth discussing...that really WAS "toy software".) The response to pitch bends, play/cue hits and
real time pitch tweaking can be measured in milliseconds.

The limitations on things like stutter-starts or vinyl-break effects are noticeable, yes, but I
think this falls under the "personal preferene" category...I am willing to live with less than
perfection on these things since they're not even possible with vinyl.

<<This was on a 1.7gh p4 with 1024 mb ram.>>

I've been running on an Athlon 650 with 512 of PC-133 ram with no problems. Again, I don't think the
hardware is the problem as much as the software you're using.

Beyond that, was your PC optimized for performance? Were you running any other background
applications that could've been drawing resources away from Traktor? There are a MILLION different
factors that could be affecting this beyond just a black-and-white hardware issue.

<<Maybe you where using some toy software like pcdj or something. Maybe you where just smashing
tracks together. I however like to use other
programs for effects or whatever I want as well as record my mix at the same time. All of these
things take resources.>>

OK. And here, I think, is the biggest problem. You're trying to do too much within the one piece of
hardware.

I'm a big advocate of "let the machine do its thing". You don't expect your Technics 1200's to do
effects, do you? (Of course, I do understand that they don't have the capability to do it, but
still..)

Let the player be the player.
Let the mixer be the mixer.
Let a dedicated effects module do the effects.

This is what I call my "boom box theory"....Like the old-school 80's boom boxes...the more features
they packed into one, the less and less quality they could guarantee...

Likewise, the more you try to ask one piece of hardware or software to do, the more likely you are
to sacrifice quality in some other respect.

As to the technicalities of digital files vs. vinyl (or any other analog medium)...yes, i get all
the math. I've been there, done the research, got the t-shirt.

What I'm saying is...I have a vast array of mix sets recorded using mixed media....vinyl, cd, and
MP3.

I challenge you to sit down with a pair of headphones and tell me, track by track, which one is
which as the mix plays. I can pretty much guarantee you won't be able to do it.

Or, if you rather, we can do it in a club with a ridiculoulsly banging system. Same result. You
won't be able to tell the difference.

If you trust grabbing files off the net and using those, then yes, you'll probably notice
differences in the sonic qualities. But if it's done right with decent rips, the difference is
negligible in most matters. A fairly decent MP3 won't sound any worse than a poorly pressed or well
loved and oft used piece of vinyl.

<<For the record I was the one all for dj'ing with a digital media. I was just letting everyone know
they where better off doing this with a wav
file then an mp4 file for more reasons then I listed above.>>

Well, like other people have said, it's not a perfect science. A lot of the nuts and bolts work
different ways. 99% of it comes down to personal preference...but in the long run, it's what you do
with the tools that counts.

yeah, what's labelled as "psytrance" is probably the most diverse of any of 
the genres of electronic music.  psytrance can range from minimal-techy to 
funky-housey to progressive (NOT to be confused with "club music" like 
oakenfold that is labelled as "progressive") to full-on, just to name a few 
styles.  there are probably at least 30 or more distinct sub-genres within the 
genre of psytrance.  it's more of a feeling and an atmosphere than a 
restricted musical style...

>Yes surface noise, turntable rumble, etc can certainly add flavor to a

much much less than a CD, or even a 192k mp3.  The amount of "possible"
sound from vinyl therefore is less. I really think you are wrong here
with your argument.
True but your talking about digital media that mastered to vinyl the
converted back to digital and then mp3 encoded. If you had the master
copy before it went to vinyl it would be another story.

>For me, I absolutely love vinyl and would never play things on cd, or
with mp3 out, unless it was my own >tunes or my friends tunes that
aren't on vinyl yet.  
Agreed some pop is necessary to make it sound "real" :)

>Vinyl is great, and I love it, and I think it sounds better than CD for
a lot of things, for the reasons >mentioned above, but I would never try
to argue that it has a better frequency response or sounds clearer or
more accurate than a CD.

That's not exactly what I was trying to prove. I was saying that an 192k
mp3 that was ripped from vinyl and the encoded. Is not regardless of
assumption going to sound as good. Then coupled with re-encoding later
is going to once again further the durations of the sound.

I hadn't had my coffee this morning so I was a little touchy.

I'm not sure who was who, but whomever was playing

really reminded me more than a little bit of Mauro
Picotto or Marco Carola...and put a big shit-eating

This here is my point when using a wav file rather then the mp3 the

I don't download dance tracks off the net. I buy the vinyl. I rip them
to wav's.

You fucking bed-wetters...

{{ "Our interest is not in individuals or groups expressing their
constitutional right to protest. It is only those individuals or groups that
would be involved in either conspiring, or actively involved in violent or
criminal activity in support of a particular cause," the official said. }}

I'm cool with that. There's a right way and a wrong way to protest. I'm not
saying it's impossible to go back to the J. Edgar Hoover (or Hammurabi)
days, but people who consider violence or other sorts of at-large illegal
destabilizing measures to be legitimate political protest... essentially...
are not too different from terrorists.

Not that being a terrorist is inherently bad or anything, but I hope
somebody is looking out for some asshole to cut my electricity off or smash
the windows of my car because he's pissed off about the US's conservative
and sometimes nationalistic approach to foreign policy. None of that has
jack to do with shit.

Smoking pot on the Whitehouse lawn (for instance) is totally different and
completely benign. I hope you all can see that. I definitely sympathise with
both sides of the issue but everyone here is so far to the left I'm just
trying to lend a little balance.

PK <- is firmly standing to the right :) of course I have been censored
on this list for speaking my mind on it. I guess free speech is only for
liberal democrats ;) of course that was over a year ago.

Notice it says "violent OR criminal" .. for example, organizing a march
without a permit from the city is considered criminal.  Many acts of
civil disobedience that have been used in the past could be considered
"criminal."

That is where I am displeased - not to mention the fact that in some
cases, the police have been accused of planting "undercover" people
amongst the crowds to actually incite violence, so then they have an
excuse to start shooting rubber bullets and tear gas and so that the media
can portray the protesters as violent.

Being insidious and subversive obviously can work both ways, and I tend to
not trust the goverment, who has it in their best interests for bad light
to be shed upon protestors.  Given the pro-government, anti-protest media
these days I'm not really down with this agenda.

True but your talking about digital media that mastered to vinyl the

before it went to vinyl it would be another story. }}

CD's aren't made from vinyl. They usually come from the original studio
track just as vinyl does. If there are losses in quality, they would come
from going digital to analog back to digital, but assuming that an Mp3 is
digitally extracted from a CD, it is just about as good as the original
studio master.

Maybe you where using some toy software like pcdj or something. Maybe you
where just smashing tracks together. I however like to use other programs
for effects or whatever I want as well as record my mix at the same time.
All of these things take resources. The mp3 when played caused spikes
especially when seeking or loading a track. }}

I can't tell here - are you arguing for or against vinyl? It seems like
you're trying to do all this digital post-processing and other stuff that
you could never expect from two turntables and a mixer, and then saying how
it doesn't work as well.

Seems like the Traktor software doesn't know how to manage memory, either.

{{ Paul Kraus <pkraus@pelsupply.com> }
For the record I was the one all for dj'ing with a digital media. I was just
letting everyone know they where better off doing this with a wav file then
an mp4 file for more reasons then I listed above. }}

That's cool, but I guess I'd still blame the software first. If you like it
and are willing to work around that with preliminary decompression, then
more power to you, but real-time decompression shouldn't consume that much
processing power. Maybe try some "toy software."

I know this issue has already died. I'm just tardy and wanted to chime in.

That is where I am displeased - not to mention the fact that in some
cases, the police have been accused of planting "undercover" people
amongst the crowds to actually incite violence, so then they have an
excuse to start shooting rubber bullets and tear gas and so that the
media can portray the protesters as violent.
---
See this is why you shouldn't smoke pot it makes you paranoid (tongue in
cheek :P)
Honestly you think this is happening? My first observation would be that
its ridiculous because no matter what the outcome or who started it the
government always looks bad when there is any kind of violence against
protesters deserved or not.


Being insidious and subversive obviously can work both ways, and I tend
to not trust the goverment, who has it in their best interests for bad
light to be shed upon protestors.  Given the pro-government,
anti-protest media these days I'm not really down with this agenda.
---
Its funny the left is says the media is biased and so does the right.
Lets face it they print what ever they think will sell that day. So
depending on where the majority or perceived majority is the will tilt
their info. How annoying!

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} NRR - FBI = gestapo


First of all I've never smoked pot once in my life.  Second, I'm in a
position, economically and socially where the right's policies tend to
help me out more than they hurt me.  I don't just blindly accept
everything around me, but rather do some thinking about the economic and
social policies that affect myself, my friends, and my loved ones.  So I'm
not a leftist college student who leans left because it's the cool
thing to do or because I'm "poor and want to blame the man for my
laziness," as is a commonly heard ridiculous argument.

You can say that both the left and right blame the media.. but look at who
owns a majority of the (more and more consolidated) mainstream media
outlets..  surprise.. rich conservative white guys, and huge corporations.
Printing whatever will sell on a given day has been going on since the
beginning of time, but there is an overall agenda being followed, and some
things just don't get covered at all.  What ISN'T covered can make just as
big of a statement as to what is.

With regards to your protesters response - it looks bad for protesters
when there is violence because they can then be branded as radicals or
"crazies" or "anarchists," and the news-watching public will bite and
believe that the government is just doing its job in keeping the peace if
these "maniac protesters" get out of hand.  People applaud the government
for keeping the city safe and preventing rioting and looting.  Massive
protests without incident on the other hand will always look good for
protesters and bad for the government because theres nothing to distract
from the message of the protesters.   But there are still things to be
done here to discredit them - for example if people are protesting in DC
about the rave act, they will typically interview someone who knows their
shit for about 10 seconds and heavily edit it, but then let some 15 year
old candy kid talk about PLUR and raving and how it is the be all and end
all of their existence.  Now who looks bad?

I'm not trying to say that the right fights dirty and the left fights
fair.. because everyone fights dirty and depending on your perspective,
everyone looks bad for it.   But I don't want people making up excuses to
take away my freedoms or collect information on me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} denon dn-s5000

the reason mastering is so expensive is because regarless of the final media 
(cd, cassette, vinyl)...the mastering must be done to the "vinyl 
standard"...mastering for vinyl is the hardest, so they tend to master 
everything with the thinking that a master plate will be made for pressing.



Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

This is gonna be a really fun monthly... really hoping to bring a diverse 
crowd down for some of the region's best techno and tech house.  If you had fun 
at Third Eye, expect more of the same as you'll see some of that same talent 
rotated in along with some quality peeps from Pittsburgh and Columbus.

Definitely looking forward to this.... more to come shortly.

it's time to bring the pain!!! 
 
thanks jamie.........everyone should support this! i've said this before, but besides luke, techno hasn't gotten much attention from this area since the shortarm days(when parties were cool). i've been spinning and producing techno since 1999 and i'll still probably be doing so in 2049. 
 
(bsp)check out my crew in detroit www.berettamusic.com they're about to release their second 12"(i have promos!) and it's already causing waves in the techno community.

Subject: {pb-cle} 3rd EYE comments and/of review

FRIDAY NOV.21ST
what a wonderful night to be in cleveland !
The third eye filled up early and these partiers didn't stop dancing until 
sunday !
As previously stated this was a "RAVE" and the GREAT VIBEZ & MUSIC went on 
and on and on
the O2 loft was comfortably filled any more would have been crowded, 
everyone was dancin and havin a great time. the sound was perfect(all thanks 
to Mr. Moose!) ! the decor was great(thanks Dan & crew)
all the djs were off the hook esp. the bonus/surprise set by Uzi ! the only 
dj missin from the night was Meghan. Chelsea was the best bar-hostess ever!
Yes the drummers were a bit loud and had little rhythm, they would have been 
fine in a bigger venue
BUT all this talk about HIPPIE  whatever is complete BULLSH*T !!!!(pardon my 
french), especially when YOU weren't even at the party !!!!
they were there enjoying the music which is exactly the reason these 
particular DJs were palying for
FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND HAVE FUN LISTENING TO THERE MUSIC AND HAVE FUN AND 
DANCE
maybe i'm insane but I thought that was the whole point of this EDM scene we 
all LIVE in & STRIVE to be a part of ! and Luke truely appreciates MUSIC all 
of it any kind/genre whatever ! and would NEVER say anything remotely close 
to what's been stated!!! obviously by a child
I try to stay pretty neutral on this list(know there's enough drama! ;-)   
and normaly would never say anything directly to someone but.. Nick S.---> 
you are completely out of line and I'm glad you weren't @ the party cuz you 
probaly would have ruined the vibe for all of us! I had the pleasure of 
talking to the venue owner the next day and even he said, direct quote-->"I 
was pleasently surprised" reguarding the condition of the venue after the 
event ,, you know why ? cuz these were all GOOD people at this event!!!!!!!
BTW ? are you the kid who opened up ALex's party cuz you have lost any and 
all respect I might of had for ya and don't deserve to be associated w/ such 
a quality prod co. as Koala-Tea(if not same person i apologize) although pls 
keerp in mind these same drumming ppl opened up there home on saturday 
evening too, for more psy-trance stompin madness, which went well into the 
morning


anyway -nuff time wasted on vibe killerz!!
this party moved to Amanda's house
thank you for the invite & hospitality Trout/Amanda/Dave,
  & yes I can understand your position on the dirty feet in the house Amanda
at the venue kinda understandable, you would think shoes would be on for 
atleast safetys sake
i know I wouldn't want my lil toes crushed by one of the many dancing ppl!

I met sooo many great ppl on friday finaly getting to put some faces to 
names; Jenny and Damon (thanks for the lift)Valerie and Jamie(fun dancin 
peeps),Andy James (w/ Lindsey) AAron(picture snappin fool but oh so kewl)the 
sidetrakkt crew(been a minute).Colin (tekno stomper) & of course 
Alex.Trout,Paul,AManda & Dave, The Control the Night crew representred by 
Jes and friends, and the whole GOAHEAD crew, Megan,Sid Moke(& his possum 
posse), Uzi, Sam(& his grl w/ the kewl pants) oh and even ALberto was there

I did get to sneak off w/ the Abasso crew to go see Louie Vega,
a fun excursion!
although the vibe at wish was nothing like the 3rd EYE, and neither was the 
sound(moose's was way better) as a matter of fact it was soo much better at 
luke's party that we didn't even stay for all of Louie Vega's set!
but, seeing Doug's face when he dropped the Hardsoul(I think) record was 
WELL worth the price of admission and the trip!!!!!!
I would have liked to have seen Dj Raps set at MODA cuz I heard she spun 
house

all in all a great time anywhere in cleveland
but the 3rd EYE was definitely the place to be
... notice the very feew comments aboutthe other events on this list
hmmmm....
makes ya think doesn't it?
    goahead def. events not to be missed !!
For those that want a taste of the same vibe sooner
don't forget !
Josh Wink @ MODA on saturday!!!(for those that drink, FREE drinks from 9-11, 
tell me you can't drink $10 worth of drinks in 2 hours!!!)
and Twist on sunday another place for a great vibe and some of cleveland's 
best djs!!!

SO GO OUT AND DANCE AND WORK OFF ALL THAT TURKEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bom Shankar !
Reese

hey there buddy...alex started the hippie bashing

in fact i was the 3rd person to make a comment on the matter...further to
that my comments were an inside joke

if i hurt anybodies elses sensitive feelings im sorry...but if u ppl cant
take an obvious joke, i feel sorry for you...this whole fucking list is a
joke as it is...and i do mean that in a good way...if take anybody's
comments from pb-cle to heart u need to get your head checked.

Uhm, if I'm not mistaken as to the party you are referring to, aka Kung Ratz
aka Alex's graduation party aka Tim and Goose Jagermeister Fest 2k3, then
Dave Atkinson aka Lemma opened it up, and he played some of the best drum n
bass that I had heard played out in a while... just wanted to clarify that
cause Dave is about the nicest that they come in these parts (except maybe
Todd, but he's got that 'mean' edge now that he's got the new ride) as well
as maybe the most underrated DJ in the region ... Just wanted to hop in to
clarify that.

OOO no, ed, he means that Odi show we did a few weeks back. Yes Dave is a
very nice guy and was a pleasure to have at my house party. I appologized
kind-a that he drove from Columbus and was the 1st one there and there were
litterallly a handful of people to listen to him play. And of everyone, I
didn?t get his set recorded!

As for the "hippie bashing", blame Methylamanada, I only chirped in. :-p
Regardless, that?s still dickish, I agree, not only cuz they are Luke's
friends and cause I heard from everyone (as well as saw myself) that they
were indeed nice people, but because they are part of our scene in some way
shape or form, and someone as kewl as Reese will agree that's more potent
and relevent to me than being just some "hippie".

Yeah, that's great tho. You'd think they'd put Li-ion batteries in the
for the price, but no. I've had mine longer than 18 months, I use it for
a few hours a day, and I haven't had any problems tho. 

Apple now does battery replacements for $100. Basically, you get an
entirely new unit.

replacements.

<<I'm not saying it's impossible to go back to the J. Edgar Hoover (or Hammurabi) days,>>

Heh. We're not far from it, friend.

<<but people who consider violence or other sorts of at-large illegal destabilizing measures to be
legitimate political protest... essentially...
are not too different from terrorists.>>

But the difference is in the inconsistencies in the enforcement of such "protests".

When the folks in charge are staunchly pro life, and they then turn a blind eye (repeatedly) to
"protests" of abortion clinics that turn violent and vandalism-ridden, then that is wrong.

(speaking of, check out npr.org for an audio piece from 'all things considered' last night about how
businesses are hampering the effect of planned parenthood by boycotting construction companies
building the planned parenthood centers...i tried to get the link, but it wouldn't work. stinkin'
javascript links.)

When these same folks herd protesters along a presidential parade route into a baseball field blocks
and blocks away, thereby effectively negating the effect of any protest reaching the eyes and ears
it was intended for, it is wrong...and unconstitutional.

I'm not saying that these things are necessarily "terroristic" behavior, but the current regime
seems to have very flexible guidelines when it comes to not only the textbook definition of what is
or isn't a terrorist, but they tend to have very liberal (for lack of a better term) interpretations
of many laws and "best practices", and they mainly vary as their needs are suited case by
case...that is to say that consistency is not one of the Bush administration's strong suits.

ON TOP OF THAT...referencing Ratana's comments, the fact is that the specific wording "violent or
criminal" leaves open a door of interpretation that a pro football team could walk through
shoulder-to-shoulder.

I'm not saying that your views are wrong or ill-formed, Josh. I'm merely stating that if you're of
the belief that the current incarnation of the federal government is making these efforts in your
best interest, I'm saying that they'd sooner sell you, your family and friends out to ensure
themselves another term and be able to get away with ANYTHING they want when they no longer have to
worry abour reelection.

REMEMBER, PEOPLE: this cabinet is very very VERY similar to the cabinet of the one-term Bush Sr.
from the early 90's. They've got something to prove this time around, not the least of which is that
they will sell their souls (and yours) to ensure they don't go down in history as a one-term
administration on TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS!

Well, since you mention it:

terrorist
n.

    One that engages in acts or an act of terrorism.

terrorism
n.

    The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or
an organized group against people or property with the intention of
intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for
ideological or political reasons.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR - FBI = gestapo

While I'm on dictionary.com, decided to check the thesaurus as well.  for
terrorist there are the following synonyms:
anarchist
dictator
enemy

For terrorism:
disorder (as in confusion)
murder
nihilism (refusal (could be a new word to add to your vocabulary :)))
tyranny (which it has defined as dictatorship, see synonyms above)
violence

I tried looking up different forms of raver to get on topic and just got a
bunch of the complaining type raver.  saw madman mentioned a few times,
though :)

+50 you-know-who points x2 :)

I did find it, for raves:
n.
3. An all-night dance party, especially one where techno, house, or other
electronically synthesized music is played.

nothing in the thesaurus, though.  I guess now you could look up techno,
house, and stuff to see what those say :)

(DISCLAIMER: I can't tell if you're tongue-in-cheek messing with me or just opening up what I said
for further debate. Anything I say after this point should not be construed as "bitchy" or "pissy"
or even "angry"...because I'm merely responding to your post...not reacting to it.)

Yes, this is the "TEXTBOOK" definition.

However, does everyone currently being held in Guantanamo Bay without knowing why they're being held
fall into this category?

Does every Middle Eastern male immigrant that had to register with INS in 2002 fall into this
category? (Shades of Japanese treatment during WWII, anyone?)


My statement is/was that the administraion du jour tend to apply the "threatened" part of that
definition VERY liberally, many times in cases where the "threat" is only apparent after their
explanation of the situation is revealed.

And again, this is the only circumstance where you'll hear me equate 'Bush administration' with
'liberal'.


OK, this thread has gone waaaaaaay off topic. I'm more than willing to continue over at the
unofficial Off Topic list.
Give em the link again, Todd!

Don't you know? Its a pattern. Candy kids wear colors so junglists can pick
them out and kick their arses. Then the junglists run and hide with cammo so
the Techno police doesn?t come and stomp em.

Its all politics.

Well, based on Jea's post, that's so people can't see how gay they are

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} third eye review

hey, we all know I don't say much on here and as I told trout, earlier in
the week I'm at a loss for words to describe what an awesome time I had. at
parties I try to disappear into the music, and that was no problem. everyone
was great, you never hear stuff like that around here.

now what with the hippy bashing??? I don't understand hippies are our
greatest allies

drums, a well it did kinda suck, but they were on beat sometimes, it was the
small drum that I didn't care for I just blocked it out

one other thing what was with the chicken processing plant segment on the
trip out screen, seeing live chicks manhandled and processed didn't flow
with the rest of the video I don't think. (did anyone see that?)

does anyone know what the other parties were like I want to know in okie got
fucked (but I know that's where all the clubbers went)

thanks for the rave Luke I'll see you at the next one

today i came to this conclusion:

bottom line: freedom is a fairy tale. if everyone is
free then they are free to impinge upon each others'
freedom, which someone eventually will do in order to
benefit his or herself. it's intellectually implosive.
besides anarchy begets government which begets
anarchy. paraphrasal: order begets disorder etc... 

secondly, you can't bee free and safe at the same
time. sucks i know. we americans need to stop
listening to uncle sam's soothing music and think

Well the movie 'Baraka' was what was played onscreen
Fri. night... I got the DVD when an old Mushroomhead
friend of mine turned me on to it. If you were to sit
down and watch it you would notice the way the chicks
in the factory scene is interspersed with the crowded
subways and streets of Tokyo. So, in actuality, that
scene fits perfectly in the context of the movie. And
yes, it IS disturbing, as are the scenes of
deforestation, the asian death camp, the young geisha
girls, the destitute people picking thru the trash,
etc... Baraka is a wordless montage of footage from
around the world and shows us many of the light AND
dark sides of humanity, it is not all about
positivity, but rather a reflection of realities both
harsh and beautiful. I highly suggest checking it out
as well as the other 2 very similar films put together
by the same director - for more info check this ~
www.koyaanisqatsi.com 

I have yet to see the other 2 but I'm gonna ask for
them for x-mas, I've heard all 3 are great.

Very deep and very true... esp. the paradoxes
mentioned here. It all comes down to how we as
individuals percieve the existentialist viewpoint that
there really IS no right or wrong and that life is
essentially pointless. These are the types of things I
have been thinking about almost constantly these
days... but all that does is present more questions. I
wish I were smarter or could at least trick myself
into thinking there is an answer or some point to it
all. BTW... good to finally meet you Colin, you were
also 1 of the 'warriors' who made it to both
afterparties. I think we have some very similar
politcal opinions too as well.

You mean like Adam Freeland's "We Want your Soul?"

If by soothing music you mean American Gladiators....you obviously don't 
know the meaning of freedom my friend.

When everyone was released from the Matrix, how pissed were they?

....probably pissed enough to develop another one. Hence my theory about 
more Matrix sequels. Please kill us all.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Chaos & Order :: Liberty & Safety

{{ colin pierce <techn0pimp23@yahoo.com> }
it's intellectually implosive. besides anarchy begets government which
begets anarchy. paraphrasal: order begets disorder etc... }}

That's very astute of you. I had actually written some material on this
topic but don't feel like digging it up right now (assuming it survived my
last HD crash)...

Anyway, I call it "emergent complexity." The high chaos state is ripe for
the establishment of order. This order inevitably, as it emerges, becomes
more and more complex, and as such, more and more ineffective until it
ultimately reaches critical mass and collapses under its own weight. The
cycle then repeats. In the realm of human endeavors, we're talking on the
order of one civilization to the next here, but in other more simple
examples such as the growth and death of a tree, we see it much more easily.
Blah blah blah...

{{ colin pierce <techn0pimp23@yahoo.com> }
 secondly, you can't bee free and safe at the same time. sucks i know. }}

Right... but which would you rather have? I guess there's a balance to be
stricken there, but as Benjamin Franklin once said, "They that can give up
essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither
liberty nor safety." I guess the answer lies in which liberties are
essential. Anyone care to discuss THAT?

Don't you know? Its a pattern. Candy kids wear colors so junglists can 
pick them out and kick their arses. Then the junglists run and hide with
cammo so the Techno police doesn?t come and stomp em.-------------------
everybody knows being a junglist has nothing to do with the music.
Well, maybe it does, but it is just for show like all the clothes and bad 
attitudes are.

We also need some bill cosby sweaters.
And everyone should have their own favorite flavor of jell-o pudding pops as 
well.
And have a face made of rubber so you can make exaggerated expressions.

Big up your chest all you bill cosby junglists!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Chaos & Order :: Liberty & Safety

Oh yes, the old 2nd law of thermodynamics.  A general biology prof of mine 
years ago put it best: "you're all going to lose to the second law". Life 
is a constant battle against entropy.  we try to take a disordered system 
and make it ordered, but all the while just creating heat which just 
increases the entropy.  (dG=dH-TdS anyone?)

i agree, this is can be carried over to every facet of life that I can even 
imagine.  figuratively with the government and literally with all living 
things.  (taking in disordered minerals, light, small molecules and turning 
them into macromolecules, large ordered masses of cells and creating heat 
with the energy released by the breaking of bonds necessary to create 
themselves)

er... sorry to get so deep here.. it IS the morning and all....

My right to swing my fist stops where your face begins.

IOW, I should be allowed to do whatever I want, as long as it doesn't harm you.

Creationists love to use the 2nd law of thermodynamics as proof that
evolution can't possibly be real. The one part of it they forget, however,
is that the law applies only to *closed systems* -- such as the entire
universe. The earth itself doesn't count, since its not a *closed* system.

I heard some bitch that spins jungle is turning 22 today.  I'm pretty 
sure she is going to be at this event.  This is the third installment of

shaping up to be even crazier than before.  If your in Pitt this 
weekend, don't miss this one.

Don't you know? Its a pattern. Candy kids wear colors so junglists can

everybody knows being a junglist has nothing to do with the music.
Well, maybe it does, but it is just for show like all the clothes and bad

Subject: {pb-cle} here's is exactly why the term "terrorism" is dangerous...

http://www.arkansasnbc.com/Global/story.asp?S=1541444&nav=F8n2JLoy

A 12-year-old Siloam Springs, Arkansas boy has been has been convicted of a felony terrorist act for
shooting the windows of three school buses.

With a BB gun.

A. Fucking. BB. Gun.

Like a three year old child that just keeps repeating the word "why" when you tell it to do
something, the American culture is enamored with the word "terrorism", and will continue to ABuse it
and MISuse it until it finds something else to exploit and abuse.

Subject: {pb-cle} re:here's is exactly why the term "terrorism" is dangerous... 

yes, terrorism IS a word, but you cannot separate the word, from 
the concept. the war on terrorism is to eradicate an idea. 
(unfortunately, just as you cannot uninvent technology, you cannot 
univent an idea.) 

this 3 year old misbehaved. he should be punished, and because of 
the nature of what he did, it is in effect, terrorism. his being 
punished sends a message that these sorts of activities will not 
be tolerated. (hell, im sick of kids fucking up. and im sick of 
the parents who dont do thier duty) 

this is a dangerous double edged sword. 

we must do what we can to keep this 'idea' to a minimum, however, 
our ends do not justify the means... this folks is one of those 
times that black and white logic do not apply(please, no Tom Cox 
jokes).

How did most kids feel about the school bus growing
up, primarly contempt i am sure.  It takes you to
school every day.  If he was the fat kid, this could
be a crime passion.

Johnson & Wales wouldn't think of accepting a student who spells primaries
'primarys'.

Um, yeah, Dennis Kucinich has a snowball's chance in hell of making it as
president.

And of course, thanks for sharing the cost of your education, you are so
much more appreciated now that we know how much you can spend.

"I like to listen to myself talk"....that seems to be the subtext of your
email.  Well at least that makes one....

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Wed Nov 26                       WATER LILLY                      Cleveland

Wednesday November 26, Dj Water Lilly
Water Lilly is a DJ since 1996 and a producer since 1999. She produces 
techno music with a modern electro feel, in collaboration with Swiss 
artists among which hip hop & breaks DJ St Plomb and Gigolo recording 
artist Plastique de Reve. The gritty, funky, slamming tracks of Water

Bugz in the Attic are a new generation 9 member collective based in

techno and dancehall. Their label Bitasweet is a home for all the Bugz
sounds, their essential remixes and individual projects. Bugz have
produced acts as diverse as The Ends, New Sector Movements, Neon Phusion,
Homecookin' and the vocal talents of Corrina Joseph, Alison David, Shola
Ama.  Remixes include the classic re-work of 4Hero's 'Hold It Down', the
sublime Viktor Duplaix 'Lookin For Love' and Macy Gray 'When I See You'.
They have most recently mixed a FABRICLIVE compilation and the plan for
2004 is Bugz in the Attic's first artist album. They DJ in London at their
own 'Got The Bug' night, Co Op and FABRICLIVE. This year they played at
festivals including The Big Chill (UK), Zoukout (Singapore) and Festimad
(Spain).

Warming up the room for Bugz will be respected local DJs Brother Mike and
John E.

Live and Direct


Matthew Dear - Live PA (Detroit)
Ghostly International, Spectral Sound, Plus 8, Perlon
http://www.ghostly.com
Matthew Dear (aka False and Jabberjaw) has made remarkable steps towards 
becoming one of the new great American techno producers. He's earned a 
devoted underground following that is steadily boiling over to the 
mainstream dance community. His minimal-but-funky techno is constantly 
pushing boundaries, while remaining focused on the simple goal of making 
people dance. And take our word for it, your feet will move during this 
extended nye performance.


Reid Speed (Los Angeles)
Breakbeat Science, Direct Drive, Contagious Musiq
http://www.reidspeed.com
Reid Speed has played to adoring crowds in cities all over the U.S. 
alongside every respected drum and bass artist from Aphrodite to Zinc. 
She's currently on tour for her "Life After Dark" CD, a reflection 
dedicated to the dancefloor that illuminates the depth of her selection 
and the full spectrum of her talent behind the decks.


Traxx - DJ/Live PA (Chicago)
International Deejay Gigolos, Soul Foundation Kollective
http://www.gigolo-records.de
Gigolo is THE definitive cult label with a roster full of music icons, 
including the "artist of sound" Traxx. An undisputed underground hero, 
Traxx has seen and lived the evolution of Chicago house music. He uses 
this deep understanding of the history, along with his musical passion and 
dedication, to create highly emotional sessions that are unpredictable, 
diverse, always different, and constantly educating the devotees.


Adam Jay - Live PA (Indianapolis)
Azure, Primate, Primevil, Zync, Chromagnon
http://www.djadamjay.com
Adam Jay has proven himself to be a prominent figure in the world of 
techno through musical output alone. On his numerous releases the styles 
range from expressions of funk and soul within the realm of techno, to the 
more up front and menacing. His DJ sets and live performances are heard 
around the world, winning heads over every time.


Doormouse - Live PA (Miami Beach)
Planet-Mu, Addict, Distort, Zod, Schematic, and on and on and on...
http://www.addictrecords.com
The one and only, returning home to represent the Midwest Hardcorps. The 
IDM flower factory will be left in sunny Florida and the cold hard sounds 
of industrial Milwaukee will return for an apocalyptic 909 pummeling. But 
really, there's no telling what sort of mayhem you can expect with 
Doormouse.


System X - Live PA (Chicago)
Tour de Trance, Input/Output, Cortex Music
The System X duo mixes trance, acid, and breaks into a wicked frenzy of 
sound. Their high energy stage presence and clever use of hardware 
instruments is an exciting live performance to witness. Prepare for the 
journey.


MF (Chicago)
Rotation
The only weekly drum and bass club night currently running in Chicago is 
Rotation Thursdays. MF co-established the night which features some of the 
finest international and national acts. As a resident DJ, he's played next 
to most of them.


Centrific vs. Web of Deception - Live PA (Minneapolis)
Intellephunk, Boss Recordings
http://www.bossrecordings.us
Straight from da great white north, dese two hosers are gonna be bringin' 
da bangin' beats. Last new years dey filled in for Woody McBride at da 
last minute and stole da show. Imagine what dey'll do wit some time to 
prepare.

return of the Chill Room
The government says it's illegal, but we say it's casual!

There's a fine line between genius and insanity and we've got both! 
Brilliant DJs, insane performance artists, and you unite in a throbbing 
orb of light: a room that's one big 3-D projection screen. Chill out in a 
diverse universe of music with small stage intimacy. This nye, chaos has 
never been so casual.


TJ Richter : mind plasma!

Your master of allusion host and multimedia magician; combining spoken 
word stories, music, and projected images into screaming daydreaming wave 
spaces of imagination. Stretch your ears, eyes, and mind wide open!

this is your brain...this is your brain fried on bacon

machine funk specialist stretchin' out yer cerebral cortex

everybody knows being a junglist has nothing to do with the music.

So I cant get to a comp that much nowadays... I'm un-subbing for a spell... be back around (hopefully by tha time I do there will be a scene again!) lol
 
Anyhow, I went to Oakie and Sandra... I def have lost that "lovin feelin'" as Maverick would say... but I still had a blast and seen a LOT of old old friends that I missed dearly... nice to see Laga packed and with tha DJ table sayin "Groove" on it... just like tha good old days.   And, of course, like tha last time I seen him, Oakie was outdone by his opening act... Sandra ate him alive in my opinion.
 
He was still good tho, and I still had a great time... thats what its all about, right? :)
 
peace and love til sometime soon.
 
Chris

So which store are you going to be at 5:00 in the morning?  
Personally, I'm going to be at the Best Buy in cuyahoga falls.  
There's a 512mb solid state mp3 player for $199.  Also checked 
reviews online and only downside is you can't take the music off of 
it onto another computer (damn DMCA) and you need special software, 
it's not plug and play.  But it has a line in jack to record! reason 
I'm probably going to get it :)  anywho, then get a few things at 
staples, maybe circuit city.  Have to see if I can afford the "out of 
pocket" price for all this stuff before the mail in rebates.  then 
have to go get the title for my car, and try to get the license 
plates since the temp tags expire sunday, and all this before I have 
to be at work at 11:30.

Subject: {pb-cle} My image gallery has moved

Finally got everything moved over to the new site, so I'm canning the 
old image gallery.  All my rave related stuff is now at:

http://parties.vrillusions.com/

If you have any links that point to the other page, change it to this 
one.  I'll leave the old pages up for a few months till everyone gets 
their pages updated.  But I'm taking down the actual images from the 
old site in a couple weeks, so if you have links to any specific 
party, you'll have to change those real soon.  Also, get a username 
if you check the images with any sorta frequency.  You'll be able to 
rate photos and leave comments (anonymous people can't leave 
comments).  You can also get emails when an album gets updated and 
stuff.  If you don't register, then all you can really do is just 
view the images, which is fine for just the passerby.

i'm also going to gothrough and try to ID as many of the people as 
possible, I'll email the list when i start to do that since I want to 
go through them first to find all the ones I know, which won't be 
that many because I suck with names.  So yeah, go there while your 
recovering from all that turkey you ate, while i'll be freezing my 
butt off waiting in line to buy stuff I had no intention of buying 
that I'm only buying because there's rebates.  yeah, I'm lame.

Don't you know? Its a pattern. Candy kids wear colors so junglists can 
pick them out and kick their arses. Then the junglists run and hide with
cammo so the Techno police doesn?t come and stomp em.-------------------
everybody knows being a junglist has nothing to do with the music.
Well, maybe it does, but it is just for show like all the clothes and bad 
attitudes are.

damn you.  my sleeping has been so messed up.  I slept last night from
like 7:00 to midnight.  then did some stuff on the computer, went to bed
at 2:00 and then woke up at 4:00 to go to best buy.  then got home and
went to get the title for my car so I can get license plates.  then got
home in time to take an hour nap and then get to work, where I'm at now,
dealing with all the new signups from people that got new computers today.
 I was dead tired this morning, now I'm somewhat awake.  Just to go home
at 8:00 to go back to bed :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} really great jeff mills interview

That's sweet, I've tried to sync the metropolis dvd available today with 
the CD and it doesn't work.  I think mills must have used the original, 
shorter version.  I was able to figure out where most of the parts were 
though, the CD so closely follows the movie that not even syncing them I 
can imagine parts of the movie while hear
ing the soundtrack.  I ended up watching the movie, and going up and down 
tracks until I had it right.  I'm not sure which part the added scenes were 
in, but I remember that it syncs up mostly.

anyhoo.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle}  how can i record a live stream off of real player

i used to always just use the realaudio driver for winamp and then the
mp3writer/wavwriter plugin to automatically record to file... havent done it
in about 2 years though, but that was the most efficient way i found, i'm
guessing streamripper is pretty much the same.

There are the photos for now.  Possibly I'll get a review up soon.

THANK YOU ALL FOR SUPPORTING THIS.
You made this a very special evening in Cleveland.

Moda has some really sweet stuff lined up.  I'm looking forward to it.

Subject: {pb-cle} First mix CD: "Golconda" 

I finally finished my first mix cd entitled "Golconda".

I do not have a host for this yet, as this is my first "real" mix cd... so 
unfortunately I will have to snail mail you a copy until I either find a 
host or we see each other out. I will be bringing copies with me everywhere 
I go... I am very excited!

If anybody has suggestions of where I can find cheap, reliable hosting - 
please let me know.

If you are interested, please respond to me with your harsh, meticulous, 
*constructive* judgements and criticisms. They are important to me!

I put a lot of work into it, so don't insult me by sugar coating your 
opinions. Please be 100% honest or I will kill you.

This is my first mix since I first began spinning a little bit less than 2 
years ago; it features old and new.

Tracklisting:

Digby & Oliver - Human [dub] // Zero Tolerance
Swimming Pool Sound - Submergible // Darkroom Dubs
Peace Division - Lose Your Mind (In your soul) // Low Pressings
Joshua Collins - Nastiness // Honchos
Bassetti - Ganymede (Robb & Skinner remix) // Grounded Music
21st Century Fux - Sunspirit // Inversus ltd.
Sieg & Mouzakis - Talking In Your Sleep // Plastica
Shawn Astrom - Syffer // Jebeq
Moshic & Landa - Faza (Moshic's Faza mix) // Pitch Black
Martin Accorsi - Ascent // Inversus ltd.
Nathan Fake - Outhouse // Border Community


Reply to this e-mail with your address so I may snail mail you a copy.

You can also send an e-mail to: pax@milkrecords.net

I will try to leave a stack of copies at Milk once I get a whole bunch 
copied.

Thank you all very much! You RULE!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Josh wink review

I've seen josh 2 other times and this was by far the best set I have ever
heard him spin and others who have heard him all said the same thing.   I
left at 3, just as it was getting really fun.  The amount of live remixing
via final scratch was intense... I didn't realize what was going on or how
well put together it was until I ended up in the booth.    He played with
peaks and valleys... and that's something I enjoy and respect.  Instant
gratification is not my thing.   He  definately seperated the "music heads"
from the random clubbers a couple of times.

Here is my full on review from the event...

What another great evening in Cleveland! Briri and myself got there about
9:30 just as Rob Sherwood was arriving. Of course we were shocked by the
Mohawk! Living the electro lifestyle to the fullest :)
People started filling in and Sammy O was rocking it. I ALWAYS enjoy
listening to him play. He dropped some nice Sander Kleinenberg remixes...
which have that drive and feeling that gets me going and in a good mood.
Just as Sammy got the room going full throttle, Sherwood took the decks
around 11. He rocked the electroclash sound and droped some sweet tracks.
Highlights included Bella Lugosi is Dead, Whip It,  a duran duran remake,
and a nice piece of nastieness that I have to assume was lords of acid or
something by karen finley i hadn't heard. I've not been a big believer in
this sound... but it worked. I was standing right by the door watching
people hit the dancefloor as soon as they walked in. So many people who have
never been to Moda had big smiles on their faces. I really enjoyed this
sound on a proper system.

Wink took the decks around 1. Nitrogen blast... and started with some nice
deepness to get in his groove. Shortly thereafter he got *everyone* in it
when he layerd "Girl I'll House You" over a dope tribal beat. The Sweet
Pussy Pauline track had everyone laughing and getting into it. Reminded me
of Sleepy C always dropping Wink's other SPP record @ the brillo pad. The
highlite was watching Sherwood takes his props while Josh played "Are You
There" and Jessica George heading to the dancefloor with whipped cream and
strippers!

It was really nice to see a strange sense of unity overcome this event in
many ways. There was not much of an underage presence, but there were a lot
of people who normally don't go to clubs here. The mix of people was unlike
anything else I have seen in a while.  It was truely a nice representation
of people enjoying music. We were all more than happy with the turnout, and
it was nice to see so many familiar faces. Many people said this was the
best set they have ever heard from Josh and I agree wholeheartedly. Thank
you to the folks @ Moda (Sammy O the always proper host, Johnny U, and
Michael Van Uhm). Thanks to Jess George for taking on this responsibility -- 
I am so glad you did! Thanks to Reese for all the extra help he added in
promoting the show! And most importantly thanks to all the really great
people who came out to support making this a memorable evening.  Trout,
Todd, Alex, Reese, Nox, Jenn, Henry, Ray G, Cos, Jessica, Chris Eberhart,
Jamie Tyler, Valerie, Candice, Ronnie, Casey & Wayne, Braden Albert, Michael
Nunnery, Quantum, and so many others that I know I am forgetting (sorry).

believe it or not I had never been to MODA before, so as the club goes it's
a good place I got there around 12:30, missed the free drinks but that's ok
because I've cut myself off the drinks for a time. well lets talk about josh
it could have been way better I've seen some of you local guys and gals you
could out mix his set tonight, no problem  the set towards the end was good
but I was hoping for a little more then we got.  I don't think he (josh) has
any idea much we get out around here. over all 1 - 10 I give it  a 5 that
with go go dancer bonus points

I must have said "This not my stylee, but I dig", several times throughout
the night. Doug summed it up pretty good. Look forward to going there more
often if they keep it 19+ and maybe bring in some more propa talent...maybe
even a Techno god or 2.

I'm not sure what version.  Darwin said is the same one the DJ Hell has been
playing.

A *LOT* of goth/industrial/80's classics have been remade in the last year.

Sherwood said "I served em 9 of Clubs.  When Josh played Jungle Brothers he
served em Alterhouse".

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Josh wink review

I haven't heard Nigel's mixtape... but I'm guessing it was not.  "Track 9"
by wink/size9 came out prolly around 98... so if the nigel mixtape is that
old that would be the one.  All her material sounds the same, though, so you
get the idea :)

I'm not sure of the mechanics behind final scratch... but it seemed like he
created this loop and played a Sweet Pussy Pauline vocal -- not the one from
the Size 9 track -  for around 2 minutes.  The vocal was extremely
prominante and then it seemed like he created a buildup and went from there.
They hit the nitrogen just as he was building up.

I had a blast it was good to see everyone out that night.  I ran into all sorts of people from the cleveland and akron area, and it was good to be out after all my problems.  I enjoyed Winks set very much, I left at 2:30 and he was still bumping.  Thanks to Doug and Jessica for the enjoyable night.

Wink played as good as I've ever heard play, and it
was cool (and more than a little amusing) to see so
many heads out at moda.  the first person i saw upon
walking in was trout...i thought i was in the twilight
zone for a moment.

Don't you know? Its a pattern. Candy kids wear colors so junglists can

Subject: {pb-cle} i hate humans.

Ive only heard about this in cleveland, AND have even
came across it myself there.

Im not sure if it's just the bigger clubs or what the
deal is, but how can Moda, and Metropolis kick people
out for promoting other events in Cleveland? I can see
where the concern is, but why not WORK with each other
and do buisness together? 

I really hate seeing weeklies dump because lack of
promotion took place and these dickheads wont work
with everyone. or am I just over my head and not
thinking correctly that shits just going dead
itself?..

i hate sundays. as a matter of fact, im hating the
WORLD right now.


lol.

harsh reality:  you live in the united states, land of the free, home of the
brave, capitalism, democracy, free trade, greed and the american dream.  if
you are looking for some socialist state where everything is equal, i'm
sorry, but you're in the wrong place.  after all, you _are_ attempting to
take away business from them, even if they are not open on whatever
weeknight you may have your weekly, because if someone spends money earlier
in the week, they are less inclined to spend money at their club later in
the week.  they are being business-people, which is what our country has
evolved into as a structure.  instead of looking at promotion as "go to
events with like-minded people and billpass", maybe brainstorm other ways
that you can be competitive with the clubs that will not allow you to flyer
for events in addition to finding other avenues of promotion.  hell, there
is enough talent in cleveland to throw some sort of a free renegade the next
time that moda has someone big in town, if you really feel strongly against
that club.  more than likely if they fit the mold, they have some sort of a
line system outside the door making people wait to get into a quarter-half
full club, flyer in that line for the renegade the day of the show, or even
just flyer that line for whatever weekly you are going to be throwing, i'm
sure that unless there is a no bill passing ordinance in cleveland or
something, that you could do this either before or during the event as
people leave.  dont be the weak ass that flyers cars though, that just
pisses people off.  more than likely moda may have done some sort of email
sign up for future events (like how red zone / fabric / long street live do
in columbus) which you may be able to purchase from them (they are a
business, they might like to make money, yanno) although not sure of the
legality involving spam such as this nowadays with buying email addresses
and solicitation to them.  in addition to the music stores that you go to
such as poo-bah's, check local regular record stores as to their policies
about posting events in their store or having flyers available near the
cashier... not sure, just trying to quickly brainstorm some other avenues
that you can go instead of being salty about something that more than likely
will not change.

oh, and business cards.  get business cards and actually TALK to people you
meet and tell them more than what the flyer can, once you've set them up in
a nice selling business way, then just hand them your card with the website
and let them know they can get the information off the website... or have
the event all on a business card.  i've never seen it to be a problem to
give a business card to someone in a club, but carrying around a stack of
flyers is pretty obvious your intentions in their club.

It was most amusing to walk in and run right into Trout, and then to turn around and there's Reese right there, and then we're talking to them and I see Eberhart in line...we go to walk upstairs and Alex spots us then immediately upstairs I see Briri, then 2 seconds later Mark, Ronnie, Candice....and the list goes on, and on, and on....
for me the combination of music and just tons of awesome people out on the same night was far too fun.
 
Thanks Doug, for the VIP access(awesome view)...Thanks to everyone else for being out. and, man! what a fun night. : )
 
I thought I was in the twilight zone with the massive grin on Jamie's face throughout most of Winks' set....now, that's enthusiasm!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} half-speed mastered vinyl

A co-worker of mine has some Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs LP's, and 30 years
later,after lots of abuse, sound spectacular. I think more than anything,
including the"half speed mastering" was the total care given to every detail
of the manufacturing process. Half speed mastering doesn't mean jack if
you're using crap vinyl to press to.

i was reading this article in "Computer music" about half -speed mastered

Hears my question to all. Have any of you listened to vinyl that was
processed this why . Or does anyone have some of this classic vinyl. I'de
really like to hear the difference in the sound quality.

cammo so the Techno police doesn?t come and stomp em.-------------------
everybody knows being a junglist has nothing to do with the music.
Well, maybe it does, but it is just for show like all the clothes and bad 
attitudes are.
