                 HOW TO SPOT A RAVER......................
  
           Ravers can perfectly understand and have amazing conversations
  with anyone under the age of ten.
           Ravers know where all the best toy stores are.
           Ravers get the most mileage out of their shoes. The toes and heels
  always curl up because they're so worn down.
           Ravers always wish the dj would spin that OC Transpo track that
  they keep hearing on the bus ride home.
           Ravers are the only people who don't have their age calculated in
  months, yet still wear and use pacifiers.
           Ravers always consider every new place they go to as a possible
  location for a party.
           Ravers hug EVERYONE.
           Ravers can DANCE.
           Ravers can be found dancing everywhere EXCEPT the main dance
floor.
           Ravers understand the art of the bathroom conversation.
           Ravers choose their clothes by texture, colour, and size.
           Ravers love homemade clothes because they've seen the price tag on
  a pair of Lithiums.
           Ravers get the most enjoyment out of gino/guit  stories.
           Ravers always order water when they go out to clubs.
           Ravers realize that "Evian" spells "naivE" backwards.
           Ravers notice that the doors near the Mackenzie King Bridge have
  an "e" on the handle.
           Ravers always know the most likely spot to find other ravers
  within a one-hundred foot radius.
           Ravers don't bother planning to meet their friends ahead of time,
  their friends are always already there.
           Ravers don't say "Nice shoes, wanna fu@k?"
           Ravers give the best hugs and massages.
           Ravers have a one track mind. It goes "thump thump      tweet
thump tweet thump".
           Ravers constantly point out the trippy visuals in everyday life.
           Ravers helped Adidas through the "lean" years.
           Ravers never know the name of their favorite tracks.
           Ravers know how to SMILE.
           Ravers always choose "e" on multiple choice questions.
           Ravers are good at playing "guess what he's on".
           Ravers will say "hi" to those people they don't know, yet always
  see on the bus.
           Ravers can't watch Electric Circus without it being muted.
           Ravers define the style of music they listen to as "good".
            Ravers know what to do with a dead glowstick !

hey gals and guys,
  anyone catch AMP on mtv this weekend?
if not, it's an ALL TECHNO VIDEO SHOW!
really cool.  they played [harshly edited] videos
by:  orbital, aphex twin, underworld, the auteurs,
ken ishii, space time continuum, and a few others.
there is no vj for the show, which makes it less
mtv-like....thank god.  it was aired a few times
this past weekend at night.  i'm not sure when 
it will air again though......it was on at 2 am
on friday, and 12 am on saturday....so look for 
it!  

i suggest that we all email mtv to let them know
that we want to see this kind of music represented
by them on a regular basis.  does anyone know
their email address.  i so, please let me know.
thanks.

love,
ryu

I happened to catch it, the cideos were good. Definately more creative
than the crap that pass as videos nowdays. It made me think of some of the
old 80's videos. They selection was good also. You say it came on ast 2 on
Friday? I thought it came on at 3am. I forgot about it, forgot to set the
timer on the VCR so I didn't start taping until 3:08. What did I miss? As
for their email address someone posted it awhile ago and it got lost in
the whole tired debate of "whether techno should be on MTV". Yeah I agree
this is just the kinda video show I'd hope they would do. No VJ's, no
annoyances (other than the commercials, but you gotta pay for it
somehow), AND  no cheesy "Eurodance" stuff like La Bouche.
You could always go to MTV's website and drop a note to them there.
www.mtv.com

The funny thing is the show is almost like the old raves. For some reason
MTV doesn't advertise it like they do all their other shows. Not even on
their website. All you can do is try and hunt it down in the TV section or
TV guide.

Hey y'alls,

	I will be spinning at 168 on Fridays now, with Militant Barry and 
the First Class crew.  The sets will be a combination of Dub, Roots & 
Culture, Rockers, and other various reggae styles from the '60's and 
'70's.  No dancehall, just warm and easy basslines and the bubbling 
sounds of Reggae music.  Militant Barry will be selecting these sets and 
I'll be the DJ, just like we do it on the radio every Sunday, only we'll 
be bringing the show to 168 live on a massive sound system.  If you 
haven't heard First Class' PA, you gotta check it out because the system 
is massive!  When things get moving, I may be tempted to drop a dubby 
drum 'n bass track in the mix as well.  

Anyways, if you haven't been to 168 in a while, or if you're looking to 
check out something new, stop by this Friday and bounce with us.

$5 admission
Over21 (until I can convince Jonathan to open the bottom floor again)
10pm to 2am 
Every Friday night at 168

I loved the fake sheep.  (Nothing sexual, I am Scottish, but don't do 
sheep).  It was good.  I still hurt.  Shirts looked silly, good price.  
Got kewl flyers.  Great music.  I loved the mix of "Thus spoke 
Zarathustra"  (sp? I didn't even attempt the German, I just do French.)  
There was even some lady w/ a vid cam, and there was complamentary 
frisking @ the door.  (Honest I didn't have anything in my big funny 
pants, well you know.)

Is any one going Journey to Delphi in Pitt this weekend?

i went back home to baltimore this thanksgiving, so i got to go to
Phoenix...I went to eclipse and had a lot of fun, so I wasn't as
skeptical about the daytime party idea this time, and i think it worked
well.  There were a lot of people there, although probably not as many
as uworld expected, but it had to be in the 2-3000 range.  I spent most
of my time in/around the jungle tent...at eclipse they had one sound
system, so everyone heard all the DJs.  I wished they had had that setup
for phoenix, b/c the drum and bass tent was kind of small, and it would
have rocked to hear trace on the large system.  but I really enjoyed
Trace's set...started out with the rough tech bizness that he does and
then went on to some intelligent and even funlky breaks for a little bit
(that was a surprise!).  he played some dope tracks.  After him was Dr S
Gachet, who I was eagerly anticipating....however, i was disappointed. 
His mixing was good, but his track selection was nothign
special....almost all of the tracks were regular releases that anyone
could have played (some tracks from Earth, an old aquasky, some GL
tracks, etc..)  i mean, if you get a big name DJ from the UK, you;'d
think they'd have all the dopest dubs and other rareties...Gachet's set
was something any joe drum and bass DJ could have played.  too bad for
lonnie for paying the big bucks (i',m guessing) and getting a lackluster
return.  In the main room I don't know who was spinnign when, but it was
cool, with good visuals...the laser wasn't as cool as the one at eclipse
though...

all in all a fun way to speand a saturday and get home at a decent hour.

Sorry for the mass cross post, but this tune is greatly needed and I am
willing to search all over the world for it.

If you own a early 94 jungle tune by Q-PROJECT called "Champion Sound" no
matter what mix please get in contact with me.  I would be glad to pay you
for it.

Some other tunes I am looking for: all are jungle and released in early 94-95.
"The Helcopter Tune" - Deep Blue
"Champion DJ" (orignal mix) - on Congo Natty
"The Arsonist" - Urban Shakedown

Thanks for you time, and sorry for this horrible cross post, but if yer a
dj, you know how it is.

I am! Even though its in my hometown I feel like I'm at an out of town
party with all the new faces. This is not a bad thing, every scene needs
growth. It's just that I don't get out as much to parties  I'm not
performing at, its been quite awhile (summer)  since I've played in
Pittsburgh, so the changes seem very extreme since I haven't been around.

PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE THOUROUGHLY AND RESPOND TO IT THOUGHTFULLY!
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU RESPOND TO ME PERSONALLY BEFORE THURSDAY NIGHT!

I am a student at Indiana University who is conducting a sociological 
study of the rave counterculture. My goal is to try and debunk the 
negitive myths that have been created about our culture, and to shed some 
much needed positive light on the positive aspects of the rave movement 
and the music that it is based around.  I do not intend to use this study 
as a tool to "convert the masses" into our culture, but rather provide 
them with an accurate representation of what we stand for.  

I have been involved in the rave scene for three years and hold a 
tremendous amount of respect for the music and the culture surrounding 
it.  However, I know that my ideas and views regaurding our culture are not 
the only ones that exist, and I would not feel comfortable stating only 
my views in my attempt to show what rave culture is and what it means to 
it's members.  

I have listed some open-ended questions based on some of the topics that 
I want to address in my study, and I would sincerely appriciate any 
feedback or insight you could give me.  I will attempt to present an 
accurate representation of our culture to the best of my ability.  
Therefore, I will be willing and happy to include ideas that I do not 
necessaritly agree with, so please be honest when answering the following 
questions.  

You do not have to answer all the questions on this survey in order for 
your input to be included.  Due to large amounts of incoming mail 
resulting from this survey I have had to unsubscribe from many of the 
lists that I am posting this message on, so if you want your thoughts to 
be included you must EMAIL ME PERSONALLY, this is also an attempt to not 
disturb these lists any more than is necessary.  Also, time is a pressing 
factor, so try to submit your responses BEFORE THURSDAY NIGHT, as I will 
be beginning to compile survey results then.

SURVEY QUESTIONS:

1.  The words "rave" and "raver" carry with them a pre-constructed 
stigma, can you suggest a non-stigmatized term to describe what would 
normally be labled a "raver" or "rave party"?  Some examples include 
"underground dance music community" or "electronic dance music culture."

2.  Do you go to raves? What are the most important aspects of a party to 
you?

3.  What motivated you be become involved with dance music/rave culture?

4.  What are your views of P.L.U.R. (peace, love, unity, respect) 
ideology?  Does a unifying "rave ideology" exist?  Could such an ideology 
exist?

5.  What does a VIBE consist of?  Who creates the VIBE?  Do you beleive 
there are metaphysical aspects involved in the existance of a VIBE?

6.  People within the rave community are often eager to critisize their 
own culture.  What are some POSITIVE developments you see happening 
within rave counterculture?  How are these developments being promoted? 

7.  What are some negative developments you see within the culture?  What 
are the forces behind these developments?

8.  Has there ever been a point where you considered no longer going to 
parties?  What were the motivating factors behind this consideration?

9.  Do you think that the rave community is portrayed fairly by the 
mainstream media?  What can be done to promote a more accurate portrayal?

10.  What do you see in the future for the rave community and 
electronically produced dance music?

11.  Do you feel that in the future we will be exposed to a popular 
explosion of e.p.d.m. (electronicly produced dance music) comprible to 
what happened to "grunge"?  What reprocussions would something like this 
have?

12.  Do you think e.p.d.m. is undervalued by mainstream society?  Within 
rave culture?

13.  Did you have an intrest in or an appriciation for e.p.d.m. before 
you started going to parties, or did you aquire an intrest in the music 
after you began attending raves?

14.  What type of music do you currently prefer?  What types have you 
liked in the past?  What led you to change your tastes?

15.  What happens to you/ what goes through your mind when you are 
dancing at a rave?  What part of the music or your surroundings do you 
concentrate on when you are dancing? What effects to the lights at raves 
have on your interpritation of the music? Does dancing relax you, or does 
it make you more hectic?

16.  What is the right way to dance?

17.  Do you listen to the radio?  What stations/shows?  Do you ever 
listen to public radio?  Do you listen to internet broadcasts?  Do you 
listen to DJ mix tapes or individual artists' albums more often?

18.  Have you ever thrown a party?  What were some of your goals for the 
party?  What did you hope to accomplish by throwing it?

19.  Are you a DJ?  What motivated you to become a DJ?  When you spin at 
an event, wdhat do you hope to accomplish?  When you are spinning in 
front of a large crowd, do you provide the energy for the crowd or does 
the crowd provide you with energy?  

20.  Do you feel DJing is an artform?



Thank you for making it this far!  I will try to respond to anyone who 
sends me their thoughts or information and let you know how the study 
went and what the results were, but it might take quite some time before 
I am able to do so.  (Finals are starring me in the face, and this 
project's deadline is rapidly approaching.) 

Thank you again for any input you may have given me.  Hopefully this 
study will benifit our culture and prolong it's healthy life.

Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect to all...from Zurn Aquaflush.

I think there was a problem with the list.  I'm trying to find a backup
file of the subscription list, but in the meantime, tell your friends they
need to resub.  Sorry for the confusion.

We've just finished designing the wall of sound for T3. It will be 60 some 
feet wide by 10.5 feet tall. I don't advice anyone to wear ear plugs, I order 
you to wear them. If you forget to bring some, I have a few spare ones. You 
can get them at any hardware / music store (buy a few). Pleeeeese, I beg you, 
wear them all night and after the party, avoid any sound (don't drive home 
with the car stereo blasting), give your ears some rest for a few days and 
also, do NOT come with a full stomack. (remember T2)

Kenneth and I (Chris Lee) have just finished designing the video walls 
and visuals for T3.
The projection screens will be 400 feet wide by 300 feet tall. I don't 
advise anyone to wear dark glasses, I ORDER you to wear them. If you 
forget to bring some, we have a few spare ones. You can get them at any 
mall. Pleeeeese, I beg you, wear them all night and after the party, 
avoid any bright light (don't drive home at night with your eyes open), 
give your eyes some rest for a few days and also, do NOT come with your 
contacts in. (remember Hiroshima in '45).

With tongue firmly planted in cheek,

Chris

Is it just me or is this message kind of fucked up?  Don't get me wrong, 
I like things loud, but a warning like this...kind of makes you 
wonder...is it neccessary to make it so loud that it puts you ears in 
this much harm?...Oh, I get it, if they get the biggest sound, they'll 
have some kind of bragging rights...ahhh yesss

I don't think it has anything to do with bragging rights. FrenchE knows he
has the best sound in the midwest. He doesn't need to brag.

Teknosaurus is  - INTENSE - .

Teknosaurus is about FEELING THE MUSIC!!

I don't think there is anything wrong with warning people to bring
earplugs. In fact, I wish more promoters and sound crews would do that.
For those of us who like to spend hours in front of the speakers, feeling
the bass is just as important as hearing it.

Hope you can make it and see for yourself what all the talk is about.  :)

love and light...

Oh my god.
I'm literally crying I'm laughing so hard.
The day has come when the sound guys who do raves actually post a WARNING 
about the sound system before the event!
COOL!!!

>2.  Do you go to raves? What are the most important aspects of a party t=
o =

I am a regular raver (to mention the unmentionable) and I think that it's=
 extremely important to have as many cartoon characters represented on th=

 =

>3.  What motivated you be become involved with dance music/rave culture?=


I was at going round to my friends house one night and I parked my car in=
 the road.  After about an hour I heard the alarm going off and I rushed =
outside.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered several spotty teenagers =
waving their arms about and having what can only be described as a great =
time.  I was suddenly overwhelmed by the feeling of unity amongst the kid=
s and I decided to join in.  The next thing I knew someone was handing me=
 a paracetamol with the Disprin sign scratched off.....and the rest is hi=
story!

>4.  What are your views of P.L.U.R. (peace, love, unity, respect) =

>ideology?  Does a unifying "rave ideology" exist?  Could such an ideolog=
y =

>exist?

These terms, to me, are the nom de guerre of the force inside every human=
 being.  If we could all just slow down, say "woah, there man, what the h=
ell are we doing to ourselves and our planet?  It's time to live as one f=
amily" maybe the world would be a beter place.  It's the facist governmen=
tal system we have in the western world that's acted as the catalyst for =
young people everywhere to take it upon themselves to do something positi=
ve for our planet.  Maybe we CAN make it a better place for our children,=
 and our children's children, and our children's children's children.  We=
, the ravers, hope to achieve this by holding all-night parties in any an=
d all disused buildings we can find.  =


>5.  What does a VIBE consist of?  Who creates the VIBE?  Do you beleive =

>there are metaphysical aspects involved in the existance of a VIBE?

Interesting you say "metaphysical".  Meta meaning, of course, "beyond"; e=
rgo: "beyond the physical state".  This metaphysical effort strives to re=
ach beyond what has been empirically demonstrated and known, and aid in t=
he discovery of new concepts, new ideas.  It has been scientificly (Scien=
tificly, mark you!) proven that a combination of flailing one's limbs wil=
dly to a 140+ BPM beat and swallowing copious amounts of MDMA can help to=
 aid abstruse thought processes.  Indeed, in some cases, such was the wei=
ght of this new knowledge people have simply collapsed and died.

>6.  People within the rave community are often eager to critisize their =

>own culture.  =


Such behaviour belittles the struggles of the truly hardcore Communal Und=
erground Night Trancers.

>7.  What are some negative developments you see within the culture?  Wha=
t =

>are the forces behind these developments?

Many of us have fallen by the way-side on this long struggle. Paranoia an=
d self-doubt work to usurp the faithful and undermine the cause.  I ask p=
eople to have faith, and join us in the fight for our right to party  =


>8.  Has there ever been a point where you considered no longer going to =

>parties?  =


A night without a party is like a hand without a white glove

>9.  Do you think that the rave community is portrayed fairly by the =

>mainstream media?  What can be done to promote a more accurate portrayal=
?

We need hardcore party people to infiltrate the workings of the media and=
 use their postion to win the hearts and minds of the general public.  If=
 people saw what REALLY went on at raves, instead of the blatantly falsif=
ied accounts of biased journalists, maybe they'd understand why raves are=
 so important to us.  Also, I think the vast gap between the generations =
is another spanner in the E-Werks.  After all - "How can you rave, if you=
've started to shave?"   =


>10.  What do you see in the future for the rave community and =

>electronically produced dance music?

Headphone raves =


>11.  Do you feel that in the future we will be exposed to a popular =

>explosion of e.p.d.m. (electronicly produced dance music) =


With God's help, yes!  Once you expose the pop-music buying sector of soc=
iety to the works of such craftsmen as "DJ Smilee and The Happy Raver", o=
r "Danny Dove and The Gabber Krew" they will see how our music can transf=
orm the world into a more harmonious place.

>12.  Do you think e.p.d.m. is undervalued by mainstream society?  Within=
 =

>rave culture?

e.p.d.m (hmm...catchy!) and especially Happy Hardcore and Gabber Thrash i=
s, and always will be, at the cutting edge of all musical exploration.   =
Mainstream society are quick to dismiss these genres as "mindless" or eve=
n "monotonous".  How can they appreciate the true value of this music whe=
n the majority of them have never even taken Ecstacy?  The mind boggles!

>13. What type of music do you currently prefer?  What types have you =

>liked in the past?  What led you to change your tastes?

I'm currently into extreme gabber.  I used to be into poncy, sub-200 BPM =
"hardcore" but I just wasn't getting the rush I used to get, even after t=
aking five or more E's.  =


>15.  What happens to you/ what goes through your mind when you are =

>dancing at a rave?  =


I'm a man on a mission when I'm at a rave.  No-one can stop me having a g=
ood time.  Not even bastard facist police.  I have a tremendous empathic =
feeling towards those around me, and find myself suddenly very interested=
 in finding out more about people.  I might ask them questions like - "Wh=
at's your name?"..."Where are you from?" and "What are you on?"

>16.  What is the right way to dance?

Couldn't tell you...I just copy the bloke in front of me.

>17.  Do you listen to the radio?  What stations/shows?  =


Some nights my dad drives me up to this big hill near our house so I can =
tune into Rush FM.  He comes back in the morning to pick me up.

>18.  Have you ever thrown a party?  =


My parents wouldn't let me.  I hate them, but it's their house, so what c=
an you do?

>19.  Are you a DJ?  =


Yeah.  I've got a record player on my hi-fi system.  Sometimes if I'm qui=
ck enough, I can flip it between "tape" and "record player" and there's n=
o audible "click!".  Unfortunately, I don't have twin cassette, so I can'=
t record any mix tapes.  My brother knows someone with two record players=
 though.  Two!

Look, I've got to go to bed now.  This internet thing's fantastic isn't i=

damn it's been awhile since i've done a review hasn't it?

damn how did the typical stevie t review go...

oh yeah i remember now, drop alotta names & talk about alotta
insignificant stuff, okay...here we go...

FIASCO REVISITED - Poorboy Productions - Detroit, MI - 12/30/96
---------------------------------------------------------------

welp i didn't even know we were going to this party, but then
christa found out lisa wuz flying in from san fran and dat wuz
dat (hmm wuz there a pun in there, mebbe).. 

PRE PARTY BS

so i wuz already in a bitter mood cuz christa wouldn't lemme 
pick up april in cleveland to go w/ us to detroit (if yur 
wondering april wuz the fly girl i wuz dancing w/ a bit @
sickness, she wuz also the girl who got shot in the neck @
that NIGHTCAP II party in detroit also)..picked up ben aka
dj atman (btw i wuz wrong ben works @ world records, but
poppa hopp still orders for them, ben merely makes suggestions)
..then the three of us were off to motor city...

so we arrive in detroit @ around 6pm only to find lisa had
went to the mall..so what do we do?..do we go to record time
or any of the other finer record shops in detroit? no! we
go to the mall!

so we're walking around in this huge mall in detroit, me in
my huge ass JNCO's and wrap-around reflective alien shades,
and all these 'normal' folx stareing @ us wondering where'd
the hell these freaks come from (ohio! of course!) hoping to
bump into lisa..and of course we don't..and if that wuzn't
bad enuff, we had to hang around the damn phone booths to     
call lisa's place every 15 minutes..so to play it off even  
more i dropped a few choice comments for all those that
were within eardrop: "yo, are sure he's got the motts?!...
he's gonna hook us up right?!...what's he s'posed to look
like anywaze?...he's a jolly ole fat man with a white beard
and twelve rein deers and he's got a buncha midgets helping
him out, okay"

eventually we hooked up w/ lisa & her friend lilly and after
watching "Aristocats" (the obvious raver pre-party movie, i
guess) @ lisa's pad, it wuz off to the pahty...

THE PAHTY!

so we get there around 12:30 or so and damn that line looked
long and we didn't feel like standing in the wet & cold, and
i know y'all are gonna hate us, but lisa used her clout (for
being dat's cousin - i guess the pun wuz intended after all)
& pulled us in..but if it'll make y'all feel any better i
insisted on paying $10 eventho the door girl only charged me
$5 (but it wuz mostly becuz being from cleveland & all i 
wuzn't used to not getting ripped off).

THE SPACE

old skool warehouse, plenty o space in the beginning, but 
definitely not enuff to hold over 1000 kids later on..those
heat blowers were nice..but those puddles in the bass room
made for some interesting obstacles..i won't mention how the
puddles were created in the other non-public space..lez just say
dat should've really invested in some port-o-potties!

THE LIGHTS

minimal

THE SOUND

adequate

THE MUSIC

Carl Craig - it seemed like it took forever for him to set up all
his gear but when he finally got on it wuz worth all the wait! it
wuz obvious that he wuz what everybody was waiting for...definitely
the highest vibed portion of the night playing live remixes of 
classic after classic...prolly the only time i even attempted 
dancing (behind the huge left huge pillar) in the packed crowd.

Mike Huckaby - everytime i see this man, he is amazing! again
i was not dissapointed! of course it helps when u work @ a record
store having access to all the newest tracks all the time! but what
separates mike is his skillz and his selections...ear candy!

Will Webb - i'll give him his props this guy's got mad mixing
skillz & i know he's a home town hero & all, but it definitely did
not warrant his hogging the turntables & not letting titonton on.
of course stevie playing trainspot boy caught all the tension
going on behind the tables w/ him vs. titonton & the ele mental
cru. basically he showed very little respect for the out of towner
& as a result i've lost alot of respect for him

Titonton - as ed said he wuz out of practice, but hardly noticeable
definitely better than the last time i saw him spin in dayton, but
not as good as when he spun @ 720. actually i wuz happy his set
wuz similar to his set @ Carbon since i missed that party. what 
caught my attention is T's li'l dance gestures when he spins...
elbows w/ the crossfader...T's got style...definitely more of a
spectacle for the trainspotters than for the dancers

Brian Gillespie - welp since will webb took up most of titonton's 
time, T cut a li'l into Brian's time & the tension between DJ's
grew again. Finally in a strategic move Dat got on the mic and
announced for evrybody to give it up for Titinton & then proceeded
to make some announcement about somebodys car getting towed over 
T's set. Then Brian dropped his detroit baseball cap on the monitor
behind the decks (more represent, represent bull shit) and got on
the turntables. actually Brian spun a real decent set prolly the
most dancer friendly set of the night. He was definitely the home
town hero that night.

Dat - mebbe most of y'all missed it but dat got on the deck for
one track right in the middle of brian gillespie's set. i thought
it wuz kinda amusing..especially the look on brian's face, but
what could he do..it's dat's party

THE VIBE

welp when in rome..do as the romans do..stevie donned the non-affiliated
black baseball cap (but kept the JNCO's) and became trainspot boy and
danced as little as possible..the end result: caring more about the 
music & trainspotting is boring as fuk & should be left for the dj 
wannabee's..i miss dancing in circles..but at the same time i realize
i'm prolly too old for that now (one up on ed, two up on dat)..i really
should retire..apologies to anybody watching to catch some moves from 
me..i'm way out of practice

THE PEOPLE

bumped into all the ele mentals there (titonton, ed & powerhouse - sorry
we weren't able to hook u up w/ a place to crash, but believe u me u
didn't wanna stay where we stayed, we were literally kicked outta the
house @ 9am..long story). there wuz a bunch from columbus: shannon,
kevin, michael & girlfriend. there wuz a bunch from cleveland: jeff/stuff
& his female friend, even gank & the spawntaneous cru wuz there, hopefully
they learned a li'l from this party...even bumped into kenny larkin...
hitting on my girlfriend!

all in all, whoever said this party wuzn't good, u must be spoiled rotten 
in detroit cuz i felt this was prolly one of the higher qaulity partys
i've been to especially for its price. only downer for me wuz trying to
find lilly before we left, we were really worried she had left since she
wuz the only one who knew how to get back to lisa's and lisa had left w/
mike huckaby..go figure..(but i guess it wuz partially my fault cuz i told
her to, oh well).

props to dat & the whole poorboy cru for throwing one of the more memorable
detroit partys -plus- i didn't get shot =) sorry i put yur party on the
PLRM info line & attracted all those big pant freaks from cleveland =P

Just a reminder to everyone, Elevate is on for Friday.

In the "sco":
Dave Hollands
Mr. Kleen
O'Keef
Sleepy C

Probably a second room, the snack bar of the Student Union building (where
do they come up with that idea?!?)
In the hip-hop snack bar:
Franzen
12" Player
Fesones
Melloman

10-4
Call 888-378-8598 if you're coming in from out of town because you need to
have your name put on the list.

Then comes the good part, the afterparty!

The Lone Locust of the Apocalypse Presents...
"Look Into My Eyes....Give Me Your Money!"

W/ DJs
Eric Skoochmaster Funk
Garic "I suck 4 bux" Shoen
Josh "I'm a moron" Harlequino
open tables afterwards

15 1/2 South Main St
Its the apartment above a restaurant called the "Mercantile", across the
street from Subway. Go in the door and up the stairs and don't let the cat
out.

Probably start the music around 3ish, and we can keep it loud until the
restaurant downstairs opens at 9am. Unfortunately, the tables won't be
suspended as that involved too much re-arranging of furniture, but there
will be a keg of photocopier toner.

the DJ after titonton, for the record, was not brian gillespie.  brian 
gillespie spun in the booty room early on.  he doesnt play trax at all, he 
plays booty, acid jazz, hip-hop, trip-hop, and old-skool classics.  

the DJ stevie is talking about was named derrick, he's part of the 
poorboy massive.  i dont know his DJ name, next time i'll ask him.

and i think will web didnt hog the tables as much as everyone seems to 
think, he did spill over into t's time about 10-15 minutes, but oh well.  
see, that's why i dont spin...i hate fighting over tables!

Hello all Net Ravers, Promoters & DJ's,
	My Name is DJ Hardware and I'm looking for bookings for the months
of December, January, & February and further. I'm The A&R director at
Adrenalin Records in New York but I'm based in South Florida. I currently
have 9 mixed CD's out in stores all across the world and have 3 more
currently being pressed. The following are a list of the CD's:
	-Adrenalin Hardcore Rush Vol 1 
	-Adrenalin Hardcore Rush vol. 2 
	-Trip Hop Acid Phunk Vol 1
	-Trip Hop Acid Phunk Vol 2
	-Trip Hop Acid Phunk Vol 3 : The Hard Edition
	-Electro Phunk Vol 1
	-Beat Generator Vol. 1
	-Acid Warfare Vol. 1
	-House Stompin' Vol. 1

and on the press:
	-DJ Hardware - "The Rhythm Chamber"
	-Adrenalin Trance Acid Experience 2 :In The Mix With DJ Hardware

I Also have a 12" currently out with my partner called The tweakers - "All
Tweaked Out" On adrenalin Records. As you can see i play a variety of
styles of music but my favorite styles to play are Hard trance and Gabber.
i also love hard edged funky breaks. If you are intrested in booking me or
know some one intrested in booking me at an event or party please have
them E-mail me or they can call Adrenalin Records at (561) 495 - 9954 or 
(561) 495 - 3919. Thanks for your time and consideration!


						DJ HARDWARE:)
					A&R Director - Adrenalin Records


P.S. : Some people in the past have said that I make royalities of these
CD's, well, I don't. I just make money to mix them and thats all. Also I'm
not tring to SPAM the NET, I'm just using the NET at a resource to find
booking all over the place. If you don't like to read this just delete
it... This is part of the rave culture....


				Thanks Again!!

Hey there Netravers, Promoters, Club Owners

My name is DJ Luch.  I host a weekly gathering called Generation Next in San Antonio,Tx.
We have been going strong for over a year since August 4th, 1995.  Many great guest djs
have come and spun on my 1200's.  The underground is alive and kicking.  Anyway the 
point of this post is to let you know that I am now looking for bookings outside of the
state of Tx.  My style is eclectic.  Anything from funky house to hard trance can be 
heard in one of my sets.  If you are interested in booking me please email back at
cameo@cameotheatre.com   Check out our website at www.cameotheatre.com  
You can reach me by phone at (210)681-7174 for more info.  If you would like a promo
pack as well as a mix tape, once again please email or call for more info. 
Thanks for your time-Long live the underground

massive...

my email is back up again, so any replies to the whole delphi thread that i
started a few days ago, can now be addressed to me, instead of crisbee...


again, its delphi, in pgh on saturday, lineup is dubtribe soundsystem,
frankie bones, james christian, boo williams, scott henry (*shyeah right* -
i wonder who if any phil will bring in to replace him...i'd expect a
replacement if scott couldnt make it...and thats phil aka candymans
responsibility...otherwise, what? is phil just gonna pocket the several
hundred dollars hes gonan be saving or is he gonna give us a comparable
replacement (dave trance, feelgood maybe?) and not some unheard of local
dj?

but that was a big digression  :) the rest of the lineup include trace with
the wicked mc dub2 (will dub2 mc over trace playing acid breaks ala
phoenix?)...bobble from atlanta (who's listed as a wicked jungle
selectah...allison can u confirm or deny him spinning jungle at all, i
dont remember bobble spinning jungle in bmore a few years back ;P and
little jen from atlanta as well as the headliners....

but you def dont want to sleep my boy dj sine.. commin at ya with the mad
skillz and the dopest+smoothest tracks inna jungle :)

so net meet at 1am main room (near the smart bar)


be there or be a fan of pezboys (sorry i couldnt resist...and btw im just
kidding i'll admit im down with nick in tha nine seven :)

peace,
hossam

Fri Dec 06                        ELEVATE                           Oberlin

 ELEVATE, Oberlin OH 12-6-96  $$$ 5 $$$
 the lineup (all confirmed) is :
 
 david hollands (nyc)
 mr kleen (nyc)
 franzen (san fran)
 o'keefe (philly)
 sleepy-c (cleveland)
 fesones (nyc)
 mellowman (ohio)
 12 " player (oberlin)
 
 Location: Oberlin, OH (about 30 min outside of Cleveland)
 	  It takes me about 45 minutes to get to Oberlin from my house
 	  in Highland Hts (far east suburb) ; Oberlin is not far past the 
 	  end of I-480  (rather close actually)
 
 ****ALso: it is really important to note that the party is an AIDS 
 Benefit fundraiser for the Red Hot organization. ALL door receipts (not 
 just profits or proceeds) will go to AIDS research. ALL of your $5$ will 
 go towards AIDS research as far as i know. The students who are throwing 
 this are not going to make any money. 
 
 ****PLEASE READ THIS:
 Anyone who is not from Oberlin College must be on a LIST to get into this 
party. This is not a guest list to get in for free entry, it is just to 
 get in. I know it sucks, but i guess it is Oberlin College policy. 
 However, they have made it really easy for us to get on the list. Call 
 the toll-free number (888) 378-8598 and leave your name or email paul at 
 spd7312@oberlin.edu . They are not allowed to randomly flyer outside of 
 Oberlin, so you probably wont see any flyers for the party (although i 
 think that they printed up nice ones for Oberlin students and their 
 first-hand friends.) I guess last year they had some problems with a punk 
 show on campus that was attended by a lot of off-capus kids, and so this 
 is Oberlin's way of keeping massive hordes of unruly ravers from 
 descending on campus and raising a ruckus by knocking over trash cans and 
 scaring little children and such. ;) 
 
 From what i have been told, all of the techno/house Djs are spinning 
 their normal styles except Mellowman is spinning some acid-jazz/triphop. 
 Franzen is one of San Francisco's fave hiphop djs and this is his first 
 appearance in the midwest. He spins the most popular hiphop show in SF on 
 KMEL 106.1 FM ( http://www.kmel106.com/SPECIALTYShows1.html ) 
 Fesones is a wicked hiphop dj frm Shaolin (Long Island NY)..This is all 
 what i have been told about the party.
 
 
 It is only 5$ and hey, I'll be there. So everyone should come and check 
 it out ;) I have seen the space (I'm not giving it away :P ) and they 
 have this really really really neat piece of artwork in it that you will 
 get to see if you come! 
 
 Anyways, please come out and support these kids. I know that they have 
 worked really hard and have struggled with the administration to get this 
 party to go off, so come out and show them how we all stick together and 
 support each other. PLus you will be doing a good deed by giving your 
 money to AIDS research. Remember to send email to paul with your name and 
 the names of those your are bringing if you want to be able to get in. 
 his email addy is spd7312@oberlin.edu  
 or call (888) 378-8598 (toll-free)
 
 if you have any questions: email paul or talk to him on vrave, his 
handle is joeboy.

alright, i have a question for you all...

lately, the records i've bought and/or seen on Force Inc. all have holes
that are too small for the record player!  

does anyone know what i can do to make the hole bigger or something?  my
records are starting to get bent out of shape because i can't get the darn
thing off of the player when i'm done with it!  not to mention that the
platform will stop when you are cueing because the hole is so tight. 

what is Force Inc.'s problem?

anybody have any suggestions?

they're germans.  what do you expect?  those darn frankfurtians...;)

actually in all seriousness i've heard a key can do the trick.  find one 
small enough to slip in partially and swirl it around.  or just wear it 
in by slapping it on the table and pulling it off again and again.

now what was i talking about again?  oh yeah...records...

the open house/forbidden planet is now playing in Real Audio. previously the
file would not play correctly, but it has been updated & fixed. the show
airs EST from 8pm to 1 am every Saturday. you can listen to it live, and
afterwards pick any part of it you choose to listen to. the show remains on
the net until the next's week show airs. The last two hours of the
"forbidden planet" show is called "Open house". this is what you will want
to listen to.
  For over a year Robert Goodman has been breaking the radio boundaries of
underground house Saturday
nights with "Open House" on Planet Radio 93.3 in Jacksonville Florida.

Open House is an in-studio live mix with DJ Robert Goodman (former resident
of the EDGE , Venus, And current resident of Electro, as well as many guest
spots). The mix consists of  US & imported progressive house, funky breaks,
house classics, old school house, techno-rave, trip-hop, electro, ambient
and even a little jungle (sometimes). Open House has set a new mixshow
standard in North Florida and will soon be expanding its features, introduce
giveaways and hopefully even include interviews with artists. It is also now
simulcast on the internet in Real Audio, and can be listened to anytime
during the week.

Artist exposed on Open House regularly include Leftfield, Rabbit In The
Moon, DJ Trance, Josh Wink, The Hardkiss Bros., Moby, DJ Icey, The Chemical
Bros., Keoki, Taylor, Torres Brothers, BBE, Andy Hughes, Chris Hand, Micro,
Viscous Vic, The Prodigy , Richard "Humpty" Vission, Simply Jeff, DJ Who,
Uberzone, Crystal Method,  DJ Lace, DJ Voodoo, Joey Beltram, Paul Van Dyk,
Sasha, BT, John Digweed, Dubtribe, DJ Dan, James Christian, Freaky Chakra,
Deee-Lite, Bass Kittens, Orbital, The Orb, Young American Primitive, Omar
Santana, Soul Oddity, Chris Fortier, Friction & Spice, DJ Sploo, CJ Bolland,
Billy Ray Martin, Metro, Lucky Monkey, Casino, and way too many more to
mention. 

I want to bring to your attention the show, hope you listen to it in Real
Audio & look for some feedback & new ideas.  The website is www.4bidden.com.
Listen to the second part. The first half is an indie
rock/industrial/ska/punk/trip-hop/alternashow, but the second half is "Open
house". If you work at a label or create house music & DIY by putting out
your own records (ORLANDO & Other Florida Projects in particular) please
make sure you have me on your mailing list. If you don't ....e mail me & we
can try to get you exposed on the show & your product in stores here as well. 

Whether you listen to it on the radio or on your PC, I hope you enjoy Open
house & hope to hear from you with your comments. 


Peace,

Robert

i say use a knife--a sharp one!--& twirl it around in the hole, on
each side. it might be more effective than a key.

well ... i didn't decide to go till like 2am, so when i got there @ 3am there
was no line or nuttin (i don't know if there was one earlier though ;).
Hmm ... got there late so i guess i missed the net meat along wit some
other stuff. Spent the first hour checkin' out the three rooms. Then
went to da main area for Dub tribe. What happened to the live drummer?
Did he leave or something? cause he wasn't with them @ uranus either ...
they kicked all the
same, though not as much as the first time I saw them. (like 2 summers ago 
@ the roxy :)

After dub tribe, or really in the middle, went to the Jungle area ...
Trace tore tha shit up ... MC Dub 2 was good ... but it was hard to hear
him. Sound system in the jungle area was not nearly as good as in the
main area ... I had fun dancin and tootin my horn. 

Left at around 7:30am ... got lost leavin', which was kinda bad cause I think
there were some peepz followin me hopin i would lead them to the highway
... but I found Eat an Puke instead, so me and my friend decided to get
some eats.

couple of thoughts ... no security checkin people when they came in, but
lots of cops inside. I liked this ... (mainly cause I wasn't doin
anyhtin' illegal :-). It meant that as long as u kept stuff on the DL u
could do your stuff ... no ones inhaler or mediciation or whateveah got
taken away ... 

Oh ya ... da lights and sound in the main area were really nice ... :)

peace

Phat party.  Shouts to all involved.  6.5 hours at this party was not  
nearly enough.  

I still like the Washington County Fairgrounds as a space.  And the rooms
were heated!!!!  YAY!  And the baffrooms were in the jungle room!  And
they had portable ones in the mian room!  Good thinkin'.

Mad heads showed up.  The final count was almost 2600 I think?  Anyone to
verify?

Sine's set was great.  Our boy needs lots more exposure b/c he's wicked no
matter what genre he's throwing down.  Bobbles from Atlanta came correct!
Soulful darkness with a subtle, smooth hip hopish flow.  Trace went on at
5 instead of the oringinally intended 4 so as not to conflict with
Dubtribe.  Also good thinkin'.  I've heard him spin better, but there were
tech difficluties. very on-again-off-again.  every time I thought he'd
lost it, he came back strong.  And every time I thought he had it, it got
monotonous.  Techstep is cult...(discuss amongst yourselves...)

My favorite technical difficulty of the evening was the one that got Dub2
of the gott-damm microphone.  Someone please tell me what i should like
about this guy!  In.my.pompous.opinion, dude has no flavor.  And what's up
with that fake british accent? Why is he listed as a headliner on the
Soulstice fliers, when MC Soy Sos is listed as an afterthought and Sos is 
SO MUCH BETTER? I'm serious about someone telling me what to appreciate
about him b/c I just don't see it.  Am I the little boy who exposes the
tailors in The Emperor's New Clothes or am I some cynical schmuck who
doesn't know what to listen for?  I don't need a plur cheerleader, just
someone who knows to tell me what I'm missing.

Whatever.  enough shit talking.  Lights and lasers were nice, that
translucent screen in the jungle room was neat-o (esp if you went behind
it and looked up close and saw the lights reflecting off the webby
patterns...it looked like you were inside a TV.  amazing.)  There was no
line at 12:30 or 1 when we got there, vendors were cool, (John Dwight's
jewelry is getting so tight!!!  he said he's prolly hooking up a
MAJOR deal...but I don't want to give away any possible secrets.  412
represent, and good luck, John!)

Well, there were other great details, like Adair spun (we missed her cuz
we didn't know....  :(  ), XL's first track was The Roots, the frost in
the morning was beautiful, and security didn't harass us.  But it would
take longer than I have to go through every one.

All in all, this was a wonderful addition to an absolutley beautiful
weekend in the 'Burgh.  Big up to all who made the party great, and 
many, many thanks to Amie (whose shows on WRCT are getting more and more
hypnotizing), Mikela, Joe, and Toby/Farmer Tea 
----start digression----
(who spun a
wicked jungle set at the end of a chill evening of roots reggae @ 168 the
other night, perhaps baptizing a new faction of junglists...these women
made fun of 4 of us who literally came running out of the woodwork
when we heard jungle...until they started dancing and it stopped being a
joke and started being fun.  By the end of the night we were all
good like that.  Jungle needs more ambassadors like Tea!)
------end digression-----
who filled my weekend with pleasant sounds, smells, tastes, and 
conversation.

Looking forward to the next In'Sync event.  They really pulled off a good
old-school type event.  Not living in the past, just learning from past
successes, I think.  That's all.

'Night.

Sorry for the crosspost, but this is about a mixtape, which is music, 
which is what these lists are all about, right?  I thought so.  :P

Mark this one in your books, children, for those who are searching for 
the disgustingly sick, nasty, badass hardcore injections...and I'm not 
talking about some shitty "pop-core" Mokum pap.  This is the *real* 
shit.  I'm talking PCP.  I'm talking Fukem.  I'm talking Dance Ecstacy.  
I'm talking white labels that you'll never find.  I'm talking about God, 
the Devil, Hell, Heaven-- do U understand me?  FINALLY?

I just got this new tape in the mail.
Actually I don't know how new it is... probably a few months.
It's by my boy.
His name is Deadly Buda.
The evil wildstyle messiah.
Now residing in lovely Boulder, Colorado.
It's called, DEVESTATING SONIC BADNESS. (he hasn't changed a bit :P)
A properly positioned pair of speakers, aimed at the Rocky Mountains 
blasting this tape, would cause a serious avalanche.

It'll give your parents heart attacks.
It'll impregnate your dog.

Hey all,

	A quick message to make it known that I finally got a Real Audio 
server running and converted all of the .WAV files on my site to Real 
Audio files, so now you can check out some special samples from my radio 
show without having to wait for them to download.  Now that I got this 
running correctly, expect *many* more files to appear soon enough.  Maybe 
even some copies of my mixtapes in RA, and some complete dubs of my radio 
show.

Allright, peace then...

Let me begin by apoligizing for the cross-posting, and plead that any
discussion relating to this subject be mailled to me and kept in it's
perspective mailling list so as not to flood all US raving lists with
unwanted mail. If you want to skip reading all this just aim your
browser to:   http://www2.cybernex.net/~tranced/coftl/
All the information, developments and updates will be added to this
page.

with that said on to the topic:

Recently, our scene has been the attraction of a lot of negative press
and one sided bias portrayals by the mass media. This as always been an
issue within our sub-culture (among many others), but more so now, that
raves are getting bigger, and sparking up attention within the
mainstream. Personally I do not fear the growth and development of our
music and our scene as long as it is depicted for what it really is, I
do although fear the distorted and bias representation of what we really
are about... It is very disturbing to know that the evil many of us call
tabloid news shows as well as reputable news broadcast network stations,
have taken something that is so special to so many and twist it to
extended measures for ratings. 

I will not deny that drugs are in part an issue within our scene, but I
find it highly disrespectful that the mass media choses to focus and
magnify this consequence, which is obviously out of reach of the
promoters hands anymore than inner city public school principals are to
blame for drugs inside their schools.  

More so than any other music scene, whether it be rock-&-roll or
country, I have never been part of such a tight movement, but much like
any other musical culture, it is the expression within the techno beats
mastered by the talented DJs that perform at these parties that bring
us together, as we all know. The DJs are our rock stars, and raves are
our concerts. Just because it isnt a mainstream activity and it isnt
presented in the same format as other popular events such as concerts
(were you sit and listen to sound as opposed to letting it guide the way
your body moves), why should it loose its validity as a scene and a
culture??? 

Most news reports are only aiding the side of our scene the media
disapprovingly portrays, by tempting young kids to attend these parties
and do drugs. Most news stories are nothing more than negative
advertisements for who we are trying to exclude from our culture, those
whose sole purpose at these events is mainly to get their fix and have a
place to recover just in time to go back home. We within our own scene
are trying to combat the plague that haunts us, and it's bias media
reports that have turned something special into something
negative. 

There as been much bickering and complainting on this issue both among
the net and outside as well. Many of us have responded to some of the
stations and program producers, and most to no avail. We can all just
sit back complaint and let things develop as they are either for the
better or worse, or we can take charge and try to do something with our
resources. There have always been negative depictions of our scene
through out most of its existence, and some may think this doesnt pose
an immediate threat to our culture, and theres no need to worry about
it. The difference now, is that our scene is rapidly and unavoidingly
rising. We have the choice to either let it escalate in the public eye
with the negative reputation its been represented as, by the
pessimistic media, or we can use our means to present it for what it is,
and reveal that we are not just freaky teenagers looking for places to
invade and get drugged. During the last month, there have been several
mis-informed and terribly uneducated attempts to define the rave scene
within my area (New Jersey/New York), including a WNBC news report, an
American Journal story, among other ignorant rants on several prime-time
shows and News Channels. I have also been informed that many other local
news stations around the United States have been focusing and negatively
reporting the rave experience. 

Me, along with a group of ne-ravers have decided to produce a
documentary video contrasting and combating the negative publicity
thats been degrading our scene as the new teenage trend known for its
open and accepted drug use that has been depicted through many
wide-scale news stories Our sole purpose (or at least mine) behind this
project is to have something out there in the basic "media" format to
portray our scene for what it is, as seen by it's true participants as
opposed to what people on the outside perceive it to be... 

As of now, I'm just trying to get footage of past events and start
laying down some kind of format or outline for the program. I'm hoping
that all footage and interviews necessary will be gathered and ready to
cut by around the end of Mosaic II (NE-RAVES party scheduled for middle
of February). 

As of right now, I would just like some input and comments on creating
an outline.. The basic idea I have for the project is a professional and
journalistic look at the rave scene in general, covering all aspects
that make up our sub-culture, be it the music, drugs, the internet,
history, legalities and so on... and portray it in a positive,
educational manner.. 

And for any of you out there who have ventured into raves with your
video cameras and have some sort of rave footage, wether it be a DJ
spinning, someone comenting on the scene (you can even do this
yourself), or people dancing, and wouldn't mind sharing in exchange for
credit please e-mail me so we can work something out... I'd be more than
willing to exchange a blank video tape along with S&H charges for tapes
with footage, or if someone doesn't have access to 2 vcrs or any copy
equipment, I'd be more than glad to copy and immediatley return the tape
along with any other charges... Thanks :) 

Everyone remember, this is a no-budget, no-profit project relying only
on the effort of those willing to contribute their labor, time, etc.. We
are following a couple of promoters around with our cameras as they
organize, prepare and throw a party as well as interviewing willing
attendees on their take of the rave scene. If you are a promoter or an
active member of your local rave scene, and are interested in
participating in this project, please e-mail for more information. We
are covering several parties here in the north east in the coming
months, but I would like extend the proposal and footage to the entire
United States in general. If you are throwing a party and/or attending
one in which you know the production staff, and wouldnt mind taping
some footage as well as interview some of your peers, promoters, local
authorities etc. and would like to be part of our team please e-mail me
for further discussion. Again, any contribution/opinion/constructive
criticism is welcome! 

All we really need as of now is to gather up footage, work on a
narration, interview the right sources and get the thing cut... If you
have any footage or anything that could help or contribute to the
project I'd be glad to hear from you. 

Remember, it is either up to the mass media to portray our scene as they
see fit to its zombie-like audience who will never question their
sources, or it its up to us to inform and educate the mass public as
well as the media that our scene is not just another night out on the
town doing drugs and getting wasted... 

If anyone knows of any current documentaries or related video tapes out
there please inform me??? 

Thank You
                                                   Daniel.Ferreira

My favorite part of the night!  Y'all should have seen the reaction the
dancehall divas gave to the junglists when the jump-up came over the
sound. At first, as Steph said, people just had to stop and stare as the
jungle posse threw down, but by the second buildup, everyone in the place
was moving, and by the second track, the dance floor was occupied by the
full crowd for the first time of the night.  Much respect to Amie, Steph,
Mikela and Joe for showing 'em how it's done.  With luck, word will spread
and we'll have Jungle back at 1.6.8. again, like it should be!  The crowd
kind of reminded me of what I think Jungle is like in the UK, with people
dressed more like they should be in a Shabba Ranks, or Spragga Benz video,
which is an interesting change!  Here's a funny point for any of you who
know 1.6.8., even Jonathan (the owner) was dancing to Jungle by the end of
the night ... I guess he missed us :-)

Militant and I will be back at 168 again on Friday, spinning the roots, 
and moving into the jungle ... see you there ?!

Wow! An excellent show indeed, I caught the last hour and I must say yoou
all spun like the tops of the drum&bass. I hope you guys get a prime time
spot when the randopm scheduling is over, also bigup Adam Darby for his
slick house and jungle show. Thanks for the AWOL, we were drivin' around
listening to it on such a mild (what was it like 55 degrees today) but
gray day...Big up Farmer T for his show the other night on 'PTS and the
set at 168. From this past weekend and this week I think P'burgh's gonna
be runnin' tings again in '97. Watchout!

We've been here. I think that CMU's bboard address got dropped somehow
like alot of us did. As for delphi. cheers. we've all been talking aabout
it. Largest Pittsburgh party ever, bigger than TunnelVision, I heard it
topped 3,000 at latest count.

Congrats to Starchild, I knew he'd tear it up after we tore shit up down
in North Carolina.

I had a great time.  I ws a little disappointed Frankie Bones didn't show,
but he's getting kinda lazy anyway as far as mixing goes.  The highlight
of the night, I thoguht, was Boo Williams.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  Top notch!

Hey everyone --

I'll be in Pittsburgh from the 20th - 26th, staying in the 
Swissville area.  

Could anyone fill me in on any cool events happening within 
that time frame?   It would also be cool if anyone wants
to be "raver tour guide."

Lots of PLUR

Dominic

i'm including mike's entire message below because i dont think it made it 
to the pb-cle list, and y'all should read it too.  

but i have one question:  WHY WAS THIS PARTY $18?!?!  it was supposed to
be a "makeup" for that scene-gypping SUICIDE party, wasn't it?  hmm.  some
makeup.  BRAINWASH shouldn't have been more than $15, it was way smaller
than E.P.T. which was only $16 with a donation.  spawnaneous strikes
again!  if anyone cares to investigate this, let me know. 

in any case, i publicly dare spawntaneous to throw a $5 party.

well to be honest, i dont think it went all that great, but in a way it
wasnt meant to be a great GREAT event.  the true intentions of this party
were to help someone close to our music family with some big medical
bills.  looks like that will happen, which is the best present i can think
of for someone who's needing the help!  thanks to walt for making it
happen, melissa for being right in there as well, and the whole collective
intelligence/ewok crew who brought it all together. 

i wont comment on the music or much else, because i had most of my fun in
just being obnoxious and socializing my arse off.  i'm glad i got the
chance to talk to everyone i did (altho i dont think they feel the same,
heh). 

the space was a YMCA on the west side of town, and there were two rooms; 
the main room being the gym (which was a little too big for this event,
imo) and a smaller room in the basement which was just right.  will web
showed up and played some funky electro grooves, trepp (dayton) also came
and filled the void for pulserver (akron) who skipped on the event for
some unknown reason...and all the columbus locals got their records on
somewhere in there: fro played some live grooves (i missed it), thin kat
played deep house (i missed that too!), bob sfero spun slo-breaks (all in
the main room); derrick madden, aria, and maku the cuttah kicked jungle in
the small room, and a few others slipped on as well.  a real local
showcase. 

worth the $6, and my time.

my only real problems with the event had to do with bigger issues which 
i carry with me all the time.  i think i'm still burnt out, that's part 
of the problem, but it's more than that.  maybe i'll write about that 
later (as if anyone cares ;).

sorry to send this out to the list, _but_ we dont have a real info line and
i'm sure the bartenders at cedars wont be happy as it is about giving direx
to cedars.....  they are on my web site @ 
http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/youngstown/deformed.html
along with a little yahoo map of the downtown area.
anyhow, here's the direx....

>From Pittsburgh and points east: get on turnpike going west (I-76) and
follow it until I-680. take 680 into youngstown. go until the south avenue
(downtown) exit. at the end of the exit ramp, turn right. follow south ave
for a few lights go under the bridge. south ave veers to the right and then
turns into commerce st. commerce veers 90 degrees left. go thru light at
wick. at next light (hazel st.) there are two parking lots. one on each
side of the street. pick whichever one looks nicer and find a spot. cedars
is on 23 n. hazel. you might hear some bass :)

>From Kent/Akron and points west, get on I-76 east, to I-80 east. go to the
Belmont ave (sr 193) and go towards youngstown. after about 5 lights, there
is a fork in the road. go towards the left, this is still belmont. another
5 or so lights and you will be in the downtown area. go left on w.
federal/martin luther blvd. 2nd light is hazel, go left. you will pass the
bar on your right, parking is ahead after the light at commerce.

ed sed:
=================================================================
i'm including mike's entire message below because i dont think it made it 
to the pb-cle list, and y'all should read it too.  

but i have one question:  WHY WAS THIS PARTY $18?!?!  it was supposed to
be a "makeup" for that scene-gypping SUICIDE party, wasn't it?  hmm.  some
makeup.  BRAINWASH shouldn't have been more than $15, it was way smaller
than E.P.T. which was only $16 with a donation.  spawnaneous strikes
again!  if anyone cares to investigate this, let me know. 

in any case, i publicly dare spawntaneous to throw a $5 party.
++
e d
=================================================================  

since i did not go to BRAINWASH, i can not comment on whether or
not it wuz worth the money...i wuz stuck @ home studying for 
finals...which wuz why i missed both SUPA-SONIC & EPT (btw please
don't hate us ed, cuz u sed u would if we missed EPT @ FIASCO 
...i really did have MUCHO studying to do this past weekend...   
but now that i'm finally finished w/ finals i can finally catch
up on all my net-time :) ).

however i do want to say BRAINWASH was in fact in many respects
a $15 dollar party, since spawntaneous did say you could get tix
in advance for $15 EVEN 'TIL THE DAY OF THE PARTY at Basehead
headquarters (and they gave the exact location of Basehead also,
so you've got no excuses)...basically Basehead wuz like a map
point...if u couldn't get yur lame ass to find one stinking map
point not only would u have never survived in the old skool daze,
then u prolly deserve to pay the extra $3 bones! :P

i do wanna add Basehead (which is basically alex aka tik tak, of
spawntaneous) IS throwing a $5 dollar party on dec. 24th, christmas 
eve along w/ girley girl productions...actually it's $3 dollars w/ 
a can of food (but if yur so lame u can't bring a can of food for
the homeless then i guess u do deserve to pay the extra $2 bones!)
...the party is called GIFT and it is being held @ carol's coffee
shop (Darby's Common Grounds on the west side of cleveland)...i
don't know who's spinning, but if u need more info, the Basehead
line is 216.962.3713...in addition Basehead threw free partys in
the park this past summer...i will stand up for Alex, not only
cuz i pulled him on my college radio show when he wuz still in
high school, but he is also one of cleveland's only junglist...and
i will stand up for Carol, not only cuz i took her to her 1st out
of state rave, but also cuz she's one of the nicest old skoolers
that is still left in the scene.

BTW concerning yur question about LA STYLE & the other old techno-pop
bands, here's what i remember...LA STYLE really stood for Low Atomic
Style and had nothing to do with Los Angeles but actually spawned
from the gay scene in Amsterdam in '92 when Frans Merks hooked up
with Denzil Slemming and Bibi (the original fly girl from Belgium)
to create the now infamous "James Brown is Dead"...only to be followed
by Holy Noise's "James Brown is Still Alive" and Misteria's "Who Killed
JFK" and the unforgettable "Michael Jackson was Shot in Front of a
Live Studio Audience" (hell i even have a record entitled "I Wanna
Have Sex With Madonna"!)...oh yeah concerning yur question about
old skool trance lables like R&S, TRESOR, etc...I think my ole friend,
DJ Ian Mariano is the one to ask, his e-mail addy is shaman@en.com
...plus i think i've wasted enuff bandwidth on senseless old skool
bantering already!

PEE.ASS...whoever asked about a new year's party in ohio, there IS
one...it's being thrown by U.P.S. in akron, ohio...don't know too
much about the details, but the info # is 330.376.1644...plus like
i said i'll be headin home to cali (same as gage & hion...great
minds think alike :P ) for break, so i won't be anywhere near akron,
ohio...but i do wanna add if u are in akron, ohio, bobby told me
to go check out his new thursday night out at the Interbelt Night
Club that he has with his crew (The Illstyle Rockers) with hip hop,
house, go-go, techno, jungle, & reggae...don't know too much about
that either, but the info # for that is 330.258.1077.

ok dats it, gotta go...things to see...people to do...

do you mean INCLUDING the day of the party, like that same nite? if
so, + if the information was provided that tickets were cheaper at the
map point, then it's entirely understandable to charge a higher price
at the door. maybe not $15, but i'm not sure. i don't know what the
party was actually worth because i wasn't there either.

word to your mother...canned food discounts kick ass by the way.

well it's about time there was an inexpensive party in the land of
cleve! most of the time stuff is $15-$20 & from what i hear about it
(on these lists + otherwise), they are worth nowhere near that.
unfortunately i don't know if i can go to this party, i think i might
have to go to my dad's house on christmas eve but i'll try to 
rearrange the family holiday plans, since i want to bring my little
brother too (still haven't gotten to bring him to a party).

there is also "who carez who'z dead" by shok, it's on "this is techno
vol. 4" but i think it sucks. much better (from the same compilation)
are "ish revenge" by ish & "krusty's funhouse" by krusty's kids. old
school madness--i sound like an advertisement =/ --with zillion of 
those orchestra hit things (or whatever they're called) & all with an 
echo sort of sound. and there's a similar track called "raving madd" 
by middle finger, on a compilation i forget which. i am in desperate 
(!) need of any of those 3 records or anything else with a similar 
sound, so i will pay $ for them if somebody's got them. =]

> and the unforgettable "Michael Jackson was Shot in Front
> of a Live Studio Audience"

hahaha i remember hearing this a long time ago, on another one of
those "this is techno" compilations. this would be funny if it ever
happened. ;] it would be played on the news, hopefully with slo-mo
replay (i'm so sadistic).

i don't know how many times i'll have to tell, and even then it
probably won't sink in.

KEEP YOUR TALK OF DRUGS OFF OF THE RAVE LISTS!!!

not like i didn't have solid proof before, but i just got out
of a meeting with a very high ranking officer in the baltimore
police force.  he told me (and this message does not hinder his
investigation) that police forces all over the east coast and
maybe the entire country are using internet messages connecting
raves and drugs to put together information packets that may
be sent to jurisdictions where they find out raves are taking
place.

i confirmed this with another police official from d.c. who 
received an "intelligence" communication containing a broad
overview of raves including over 10 pages of internet messages
taken right off of ne raves.

so all you _kids_ who think the internet is this great open forum
to discuss anything you like, keep in mind how damaging you 
running your mouth can really be.

raves are about music, that is why we throw them.  i don't know
why anyone else comes to them, but if a drug experience is 
necessary for you to enjoy a rave, then please either find
another place to do your drugs, or at least stop talking about
in a place where other people will suffer from your blabbing.

and to anyone who responds to this with "drugs, drugs, drugs,
i'll do all the drugs i want, it's a free country", please do 
not come to anymore ultraworld events.

this post was not an attempt to distance ourselves from the
scene, or appease the police, it is just some advice for 
anyone interested in keeping the scene alive.

and i would please ask that everyone on the list send _personal_
messages to anyone talking about drugs to take the talk 
somewhere else.

if anyone feels it appropriate, please forward this to any
internet groups who may want to hear it.

thanks
lonnie

just thought i'd announce that altho i will not be able to attend
GIFT (i'll be in california), the christmas eve party being thrown
by girley girl and basehead productions in cleveland on dec. 24th
at common grounds coffee shop in westlake, i will be donating one
of my pieces of art entitled "The DeEvolution of Reality" to be
auctioned at the party to benefit the homeless of cleveland. so
if u go to the party, check out my piece...it's a multiple image
computer graphic abstraction of a three dimensional color pastel
painting i did awhile back...the piece depicts the deevolution of
reality the psychedelic state spawns...hopefully it will make 
enough money to cover the price of the frame and enough left over
to give to the homeless. oh yeah, the info number for the party
is 216.962.3713. the price of the party is $3 with a can of food
for the homeless for christmas and $5 without.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 20, 1996

"Location To Be Announced Rave Design Exhibit to Tour USA"

An exciting travelling collection of rave design, cultural artifacts and
sound, "Location To Be Announced" makes a club night into much more and is
irresistable at a rave. This exhibit is incredible sampling of rave art and
design from all over the world - from the flyers of the early NYC "NASA"
parties to the advanced art of England's "Cream" club collaborative and
designers republic (Wipeout 2097). "Location to Be Announced" is flyers,
logos and records sleeves - some of the most eye-popping rave creations
ever to spring out of some 15-year-old kid's Mac or from the studios of the
most talented professional designers on the planet. Add touring DJs to the
mix and you've got one amazing event.

Details
The exhibit is curated by Josh Brown and Keith Brown (no relation) of
Exquisite Corpse Artsite in Burlington, Vermont and features over a dozen
large sheets of transparent lexan where the flyers are mounted, allowing
both sides to be viewed. The sheets are hung from the ceiling, turning any
space into a mosaic of color. Everyone who goes out can get into this show. A
four-week national tour is beginning in March, 1997.

Specifications
* Location To Be Announced exhibit complete with professional lighting. The
exhibit is comprised of flyers, records, record sleeves, quotes and photos
from rave culture displayed by slide projectors and a video projector
showing the eye candy of visual rave stimulation on either a large screen
or an entire wall of the venue.

* Liquid Todd and a rotating cast of international DJ talent delivering
hours of sonic bliss.

Local clubs and raves add their own DJ lineup to the show. This is a unique
and groundbreaking promotion suitable for raves, clubs, galleries or cafes
- an unprecedented collection of rave art guaranteed to contain flyers from
parties you've been to (or at least dreamt of going to). Location to Be
Announced is a vibrant tribute to club and rave culture that captures the
excitement of a night that wasn't just a party, but an event.

featured a party with DJs Rob Paine (Philly), Liquid Todd (Boston), Jah Red
and Monty (NJ Underground) and a host of East Cost talent.

monster load other jobs - but were still finding time to come up with a
few little ditties that will rock yer upcoming parties in the near future.

latest EP, Combat! will be hitting store shelves soon.

Kinder Atoms SUPER NICE HIPPY PANTS represents a solid year of recording
at the nice+smooth ultra media facility.  SUPER NICE, disc one, is a lush
74 minute continuously mixed ambient soundscape that falls in and out of
whispered melodies and forgotten love themes. A culmination of tracks
recorded in dreamtime by the group, the album features recorded encounters
with para-dimensional entities as well as experiments in subliminal
brain-wave synchronisation techniques.  Two of the albums tracks,  GAMELAN
and SCAMMER, were recorded live to air on Toronto radio station CKLN-FM
during Gerald Belanger's Unfortunate Sonic Casualties program (heard
Wednesdays between 12-2 am on 88.1fm).

HIPPY PANTS, disc two, is the type of material heard at many of Kinder
Atom's recent live performances.  Think hard-hitting in your face techno, a
solid dose of downbeat tracks and massive bottom ends and it just dont get
no better.

Those digi-dawgs, Digital Poodle return to bark up a storm on the brand-new
extended play single (57 minutes!) featuring ruff and funky tracks direct
from the doghouse. Included is two mixes of COMBAT, the vocoder driven
techno-industrial stomper with deep sub-bass for the dancefloor.  Also
featured is the standout distorto-chemical beats track from the Nekrology
compilation, FUNKASS.  Youll howl at the bone breaking edit of 1993's rare
track METAL FIGHT !  and foam at the mouth for the Smokin-new-PCP
laced-version of CRACK (released originally on vinyl through UK's NINJA
TUNE label).

Techno tricksters KINDER ATOM provide a whole new look to the unreleased
Poodle track BUTCH, a mean electro booty track.  Also added is a bonus edit
of the 1993 rarity, RED STAR.

More info on these two releases will be mailed out your way as soon as we
find out the exact street date.  Both will be available through
Cleopatra/Hypnotic as well as Caroline Records internationally.  If thats
not enough, a full length Digital Poodle album will be ready by March and
three more Kinder Atom full length releases are already slated for 1997.

-----------------------------------------
		web page updates
-----------------------------------------

Gerald has been working steadily to get the new Modulations web page
updated.  

Fresh info, cool audios and hot links should make your visit somewhat
worthwhile once again.   Also, we have consolidated the former Kinder Atom
site (http://www.interlog.com/~discarn8) and it can all be found @
http://www.io.org/~virex.  Weve included the past 6 mailings (this will be
where future mailings will be archived) as well as putting the complete
DOVe discography online.  

If its not 100% by the time you surf on over, just be patient.  It should
be completed before Christmas.

---------------------------------------------
	double top ten for nice+smooth
---------------------------------------------

Toronto DJ and musicologist, Chris Twomey recently published his best of
lists for  1996 (some of you may have already seen it).  We here at
nice+smooth scored with two titles in his Top 10 Canadian Releases for 1996
with the Trip Into Dub compilation and the Kinder Atom debut release,
Atomika.   

No surprise that Watershell scoring the #2 spot with their Initial Scroll
EP.  As we told you in a recent mailing, this EP features the Legion of
Green Men kids along with Jarkko & Sugar Daddy Moth & its sure to be a
crowd pleaser.   

Chris currently writes for a number of zines and online journals.  You can
contact him at COSTAN@fis.utoronto.ca if you want to see his full best of
list.  

Thanks much Chris.  Peace.

------------------------------------------
	are you on plan 11 ?
------------------------------------------

Just thought Id share some information on a cool little label here in
Toronto, Plan 11.  Run by Digital Poodle member, Dave Faris, Plan 11 caters
to quite those looking for some really good underground releases or for
something a bit different.

Only through Plan 11 will you find the fantastic cassette release of
M.I.B., otherwise known as Men In Black.  MIB is a collaboration between
DPs live drum meister, Kristian Helstrom, Bill Mason and Alien Tom
Munkacsi.  Other releases on the Plan 11 label include the original Elektro
Genetiks release (now reissued under a different title in  USA/Europe as
Acid Genetiks) and the Nekropolis compilation CD.  For more information on
Plan 11, their releases and their brand new catalogue... contact Dave Faris
at plan11@chartnet.com.

------------------------------------------
		mapping out new music
------------------------------------------

A new label on the West Coast of Canada, Map Records has opened its doors
for business.  Vancouver beats fanatic, Robert Shea brings MAP its first
release with Welcome To Lotus Land.  As Shea puts it, WTLL blends West
Coast Trancefusion and Rhythmic Pacifica into one release with house, dub,
detroit techno, global ambient, jazz and other sounds yet to be defined --
all mixed into a sonic melting pot.  

Obviously something worked as it scored number 8 on Twomeys best Canadian
releases for 1996... not bad for CD that hasn't even been out a month.
Artists like Capm Stargazer (of Off and Gone fame), Dreamlogic, Mere
Mortals, Pilgrims of the Mind, Landhip and MC2&Erra make this disc a true
treat for the ears.

	for something completely different
-------------------------------------------

Looking for something a weee bit different during your online odyssey.  The
aforementioned MIB member, Alien Tom Munkacsi has hooked his spaceship
online and wants to communicate with you..  He wants you earthly creatures
to know that his website carries some info on very cool T-Shirt designs....
as well as his mind-blowing array of artwork.   I have several of his
shirts and theyre unlike anything Ive ever seen - and always great to
wear at parties.

Check his page at  http://www.iaw.on.ca/~jsquires/OtherWorldOrder


------------------------------------
		events
------------------------------------

Just two quick things to let you know about... and it only pertains to you
folks that are in the Toronto area.  Kinder Atom's DJ, DJ Gerald, is
resident every Friday at E-space, located at 28 Gunns Road in the Keele &
St. Clair area.  Worth the drive.

If you're basing your new years plans as to where Kinder Atom is playing,
you may want to make alternate plans.  It's still up in the air whether or
not they are going to be doing the DOSE/DESTINY/UTOPIA show here in Toronto
due to organizational problems out of our hands.  We will let you know
where KA will be performing this new years as soon as we know.  Also check
the DOSE info line for more information.

ooh.. weve been busted again.  Seems for some reason that there was a
problem after it left our hands and into the hands of the pressing plant.
Only the first batch produced had that problem (about 300) so we decided to
reissue/remaster/reedit it on the new DP EP, Combat !  So.. in otherwords,
youre fortunate enough to have a copy of the glitchmix.

>Could you update me on any Malhavoc info since you are on the scene
>rather than 1300 miles from the scene (like myself!)

Those of you that are into Malhavocs material will be pleased to hear that
James has finally crawled out of the studio with a new album in hand.
According to James, it needs some sweetening, a little editing and a few
touchups and its finished.   Heres the interesting part... early in the
new year, Mr. Malhavoc himself will be jetting off to Los Angeles to remix
Motley Crue.  Go figure... I guess this is what happens if you get the
opportunity to remix Tool.  For those of you that want more info on
Malhavoc, contact me at chrisd@passport.ca.  Put in the subject line
MALHAVOC and Ill be sure your messages are forwarded to James.

>do any dance radio stations broadcast shortwave??

Honestly, Im not too sure.  I do know that Energy 108 here in Toronto is
planning to go with a Realaudio broadcast in the near future.  You may also
try searching for CIUT 89.5.  Rumour has it they are broadcasting on the
web.  They have some great techno shows and drum & bass/jungle shows
especially on Sunday nights and Wednesday late evenings.

Also, if you have shortwave, you can always tune into the BBC (United
Kingdom) national feeds.  There are several great programs that are
broadcast throughout the UK.. and most likely on Shortwave.  Times to try
are BBC1 on Friday between 10-12am, Saturday between 5 & 7 pm, Sunday
between 8 & 10 pm and Saturday between 2 & 4 pm.  Keep in mind that all
times quoted are UK based  I just wish Londons Kiss-FM would broadcast
shortwave.  To sit in my living room listening to Coldcut and the Ninja
Kids cutting up new wax would a bonus treat.

If any of you folks know of any shortwave and/or realaudio servers that may
interest members of our mailing list.. then please share them with us.
Ill post them on a constant basis.

Anyways, all the best to you and your families this holiday season.  

As well, thanks to all of your for your interest in nice+smooth over 1996
and we look forward to serving you in 1997.  Also a thanks from the folks
responsible for Kinder Atom and Digital Poodle for supporting them over the
years.  We all appreciate it.

Excuse the bit of a cross post here but i'm pretty excited. =)

For all those kids out there looking for something to do New Years Eve and
Day and even the day after...I GOT THE PERFECT IDEA:

:1999:An Escapade in Trance:
Dec 31-Jan2 (yes thats right)
INFO: 972-558-1717

This is gonna be fucking huge. Look at it as the Further, Interstellar Outback, 
or Circa of TEXAS. Yes come out and support the texas scene. DJs from all over
the state playing together in a several night fest in a safe, secure, and legal
location where Farm Aid was held!
==================================================================

my ole bud ronnie e-mailed me about this party, i guess it's s'posed
to be purdy massive, the biggest in texas history & i guess he's
involved w/ it. here's what he sed...

word has it that Brian and Lee of UPS have amicably parted ways.  Brian will
be handling 100% of UPS' events from now on, and Lee will be throwing his
own events.  There is no animosity between the two of them.


this seems like a nice, inexpensive, chill event.  i urge anyone who cannot
afford to go elsewhere (which will most likely include myself) to attend.

Subject: {pb-cle} ride to balto for the carless one

Hello again, I am requesting more transportation!  This time i am
attempting to be at Fuck The Bullshit in the Balto area on New Year's Eve.  

I live in Philly but I am bohemian when it comes to transportation.  If
anyone is leaving from/passing thru philly, that would be ideal.  However,
I can get to places along the east coast suck as wilmington, newark, etc.
I can even get myself to baltimore proper.  My concern is getting to space
itself.  

If anyone is going to this tight, vibey party thrown by Bliss and the
Activated crew from one of those places, (incl Baltimore) It would really
make my New Year's if I could hop a ride with you!!!!  

Side note, amazingly enough, I got my ass to soulstice despite conflicts
with 4 rides in a row.  here's my itinerary....

oversleep, miss one bus to dc.  Leave, take trolly to center city.  Get
off a stop early, miss second bus to dc.  Wait in line for 30 minutes, buy
ticket, play with hair in baffroom, decide not to do anything with it.
Get on bus, sleep like baby till baltimore.  Doze till silver springs,
look around to dc.  stand in line at info booth in crazy busy bus station
to be given a metro guide and a brush off by a very disgruntled Greyhound
worker.  Walk 3 blocks to union station.  Eat some food.  Wander around.
decipher directions to party.  ask for more info at metro info booth.  get
on red line metro.  transfer to yellow line, ride till last stop.  get off
and take educated guess as to where to go.  confirm guess at holiday inn.
walk 1.5-2 miles in the gathering dark.  find space precisely the same
time I began to freak out.  go in, have a great time.  :)

catch a couple hours sleep with the massive at the holiday inn afterwards,
ride to 2 different airports with 2 exhausted promoters and a frustrated
performer.  take yellow line back to red, red to union station, "tha dog"
back to philly, shop, subway to trolley, trolley to front door.  Total
travel time:  about 18 hours.  :P

Skip work on monday, decide never to do that again.  ;)

although, the metro is so phat I think I'll take another trip to DC just
to ride it again!

Shouts to the L-dopah crew who threw a great first party.  

stephanie

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

i sent this to the list a couple of days ago, but i'll do it again, so here
it is:



to anyone who was wondering if there was anything going on New Years Eve in
Ohio, here it is:

          

                              NEW YEARS EVE '96


featuring dj's:

                             THEO PARISH (7th City, Detroit)


                             MIKE HUCKABY (detroit)

                             
                             THE REBEL CREW (not sure who or where)


                             THE ILLSTYLE ROCKERS (state breaking champions)


                PACE                SYNAPSE            IFREE


                SAMMY               YABETTE            CONSPIRACY



                             HESOHI              SOK




$10 presale at Riff Raff
$15 at the door


info:  330.376.1644






word has it that Brian and Lee of UPS have amicably parted ways.  Brian will
be handling 100% of UPS' events from now on, and Lee will be throwing his
own events.  There is no animosity between the two of them.


this seems like a nice, inexpensive, chill event.  i urge anyone who cannot
afford to go elsewhere (which will most likely include myself) to attend.

UNION is intended to be a small gathering for friends and family, in
celebration of unity and of the new year to come.  it is meant to be 
intimate, low-key, relaxing, and of course, fun.  it's also free.

DJs will include dan bell from detroit, and all the ele_mentals including
todd sines, titonton, monochrome, lunar (myself), m/c/jones, placebo, and
others. 

if you are interested in being a part of this, call the table of 
ele_ments info line: 614.470.0929 for directions, location information, 
and to find out what time we'll be getting started.

the nature of this (unrehearsed) event means i can't post directions.
call the line by about 8 PM (or shortly thereafter) and direcs should be 
there.  it'll be close to OSU campus.

thanks.

Any chance any pgh kids are trying to get out to "The Event" in Milwaulke
on Dec 31?  Nope, too far?  Yeah, but I thought I'd try.  Anything else
going on in the next two weeks or so?  I'm having a creepy feeling everone
has dissappeared (that's what living at home does to you.)

have phun,

just FYI folks:

well there was this kid at this girls house in cowtown bragging about being
a drug dealer and all.  he was aggressively pushing GHB and billing it as a
sort-of-smart drug to alot of ppl there.  anyhow from the sounds of it he
is hitting _ALOT_ of area parties selling this stuff.  ppl who drank
alcohol and then his GHB were puking.  everyone else said it was neat.  

from WWW:

* IF YOU TAKE A DOUBLE DOSE OF GHB YOU MAY FALL UNCONSCIOUS and BE
UNROUSEABLE FOR UP TO 4 HOURS. 

* IF YOU TAKE 3 - 4 TIMES YOUR PERSONAL THRESHOLD DOSE, YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF
UNCONSCIOUS AND VOMITING

FYI:  GHB is not approved for over the counter sales, but still is
available thru other means, and is not a DEA regulated substance and is
legal to posess under federal law (as of 1994)....  dunno more than that.

most of the GHB available through such channels is of the "bootleg"
variety, manufactured by non-professional "kitchen" chemists, concerns
about quality and purity should be kept in mind. Caveat emptor (buyer beware)!

Nope.  The list is pretty much empty.

Holidays in the 'burgh are always pretty boring for ravers.  I think a 
lot of us need a break from a busy year.  :)  But seriously, I think a 
lot of people go home for the semester break.

who is going to aeonia in st louis from the east or northeast? me &
chris/dj buff are going to it from ohio & want to bring other people,
since it's a long drive. he's coming from youngstown, then we're
probably taking 76 west to akron then 71 south to columbus then 70 
east to st louis. if you're along the way, or not too far out of the
way, we can pick you up. there is room for 3 people besides us in his
van & i'm guess we'll just take the first 3 people we find that
definitely want to go.

alright everyone i am just as excited as you are about this new year's
Bassrush!  a couple things:

1)  there are about 300, now maybe even less, tickets left in the country
for bassrush and they are mostly all at modern music or musicnow.  i was
in musicnow today and they were going VERY quickly.  for anyone who is
excited about coming and is thinking about doing it last minute-think
again.  you must have a ticket to get in!  i am only going to warn you
one time.  no one will enter the party without a pre-bought ticket.  we
are almost sold out and i can guarantee you we will be by tomorrow.  btw,
musicnow should be open till 6 on december 31st.

2)  do not bring markers, weapons, drugs, bad attitudes, or any near
sketchy materials that may hinder your fellow party-goers from entering as
quickly as possible.  we want the line to move smoothly and the less stuff
you bring in the quicker everyone gets in.

3) do arrive early.  there are a lot of people coming so the earlier the
better for your sake and it gives you more time to enjoy the party and
watch it unfold.  also, be careful where you park.  we have 6 police
officers who will be patrolling the area and ensuring your safety, but
just use common sense, okay?!

4) do have fun!!!!  it's new year's and it's time to bring 1997 in right.  

so i'll see you all tomorrow night.  once again i'll be the tall blond
with a big smile on her face and bassrush laminates around her neck.  and
from all of us here at bassrush.. may you have a happy new year.
