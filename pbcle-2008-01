Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Friday Jan 11th

$12 pre-sale
$20 @ door

Location Secret Virgin Space [Akron area: Directions will be posted 
online the week of and on the info line]

It's time to play it for keeps boys and girls. We have one of our most 
honered guests to date coming to pay N.E. Ohio for the first time in 
almost a decade. Once part of Cybersonik alongside Richie Hawtin and 
John Acquaviva we bring you

<img src="http://www.beyondbooking.com/artists/daniel_bell/daniel_bell_190.jpg">

Daniel Bell [DBX]
Daniel Bell is considered to be one of the pioneers of the minimal 
techno genre. Born in Sacramento, California, Bell grew up outside of 
Toronto, and later moved to Detroit where he collaborated with Richie 
Hawtin as Cybersonik for three years on Plus 8 records. In 1991, he 
started his own label, Accelerate, where he released a string of 
extremely influential releases as DBX.

Bell was influenced primarily by Chicago House as well as the works of 
Steve Reich and Philip Glass. His productions are characterized by 
minimalist house grooves accented by blips and bleeps. Some tracks also 
feature bizarre voice effects and eerie atmospherics such as "Losing 
Control," which caused a sensation when released in 1994.

In the mid to late 90's Bell moved behind the scenes to create 7th City 
Distribution which exclusively pressed and distributed Robert Hood's 
M-plant, Dopplereffekt's Dataphysix and Anthony Shakir's Frictional 
record labels, to name a few. He also launched Elevate, Harmonie Park 
and relaunched 7th City Records. Debut releases on these labels helped 
kick start the music careers of Todd Sines, Rick Wade, Theo Parrish and 
Shawn Rudiman among others.

In 2000, he relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first dj mix 
CD, "The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell," on Tresor Records to wide 
critical acclaim. 2003 brought a follow-up release on Logistic records, 
"The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back," and soon after a retrospective cd 
of older work was released: "Blip, Blurp, Bleep: The Music of Daniel 
Bell".

For the past few years Daniel has kept a heavy dj schedule that has 
brought him all over the world. In 2007, he took a step back from djing 
to focus on production and developing a live show that he's finally 
taking to the road.

Live in Tel Aviv 06

In creating an enviroment for this event to truly deliver all the 
potential that techno can bring to the table we will be enlisting the 
help of some of the best sound engineers in the buisness bringing a semi 
of no hards bar chest compressing sound stage. No expense will be 
spared.

Coming to help us beat these speakers like their built to be beaten will 
be some of the family who have been dying to push air like this for a 
long time.

Sat Feb 09                    SHUT UP AND DANCE                       Akron

This event is part of the Animation and Gaming Ohio Convention 2008...

Animation and Gaming Ohio is a new type of Convention in which Animation 
and Gaming come together for 48 solid hours of uber craziness. It 
encompasses everything from your favorite anime to your favorite 
childhood cartoon, and your favorite street fighter game to your 
favorite collectible card game. If you can name it, this is the 
convention for them!

The idea to create a convention like Animation and Gaming Ohio came 
shortly after Cleveland's Colossal Convention 2006, in which a popular 
event called "Live Action Gaming" took place. It's creator, Jason 
Taylor, decided that it was high time for a new type of convention to 
arise. With the help of a few friends and the Random Battle Group, new 
ideas were born, and Jason was starting to think that the idea of 
bringing animation and gaming together would be great. Since then, many 
people have come to the helm, including Josh Farley, who is responsible 
for the majority of the advertising for the convention.

We here at Animation and Gaming Ohio (also dubbed "A & G Ohio") invite 
you to come and see exactly what we are all about during the weekend of 
February 8-10, 2008. With a bunch of new panels and some very special 
events, we are sure it would be very well worth your time and money to 
come see a new convention be born. So come, join our forums and post 
what you would like to see! After all, this convention is "by the fans, 
for the fans."

Check out www.aandgohio.com for more info on the Convention!!!

Fri Apr 18                       CANDYBALL 4                            NYC

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Subject: {pb-cle} pgh : good field recording locations

I am going to be in the burgh overnight tomorrow (wednesday) for
business.  Have the afternoon/evening to kill.  Thought I would scour
the city with my recorder to capture some interesting environmental
field recordings.

Anyone have suggestions on some notable locations with interesting
aural potential?

Driving through one of the tunnels; Ft. Pitt, Squirrel Hill, Armstrong, 
or Liberty.
In the middle of the PPG Building Complex downtown.  It's four sides of 
plate glass.
In Oakland, inside the glass enclosed bridge that crosses over Forbes 
Avenue at Pitt's Hillman Library.

Subject: {pb-cle} are we ready for a BLACK leader?

-------------------------------1199963684
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

On _April 29_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_29) , _1992_ 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992) , at 5:39 PM, Reginald Oliver  Denny loaded his red, 
18-wheel truck with 27 tons of sand and began driving to a  plant in _Inglewood_ 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California)  where  the sand was due. 
At 6:46 p.m., after entering the intersection at Normandie,  BLACK rioters 
threw rocks at his windows and he heard people shouting for him to  stop. A 
BLACK man named _Antoine  Miller_ 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antoine_Miller&action=edit)  opened the truck door, giving others the chance to 
pull Denny out.  Another BLACK man, Henry Keith Watson, then held Denny's head 
down with his  foot. Denny, who had done nothing to provoke the violence, was 
kicked in the  stomach. A BLACK man who had led a liquor store break-in earlier 
that day hurled  a five-pound piece of medical equipment at Denny's head and 
hit him three times  with a claw hammer. A BLACK man named _Damian Monroe  
Williams_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Williams_(criminal))  (also known 
as "Football") then threw a slab of concrete at Denny's  head and knocked him 
unconscious. Williams then did a victory dance over Denny.  He then flashed 
gang signs at news helicopters, which were televising the events  live, and 
pointed and laughed at Denny.  A BLACK man named Anthony Brown  then spat on Denny 
and left with Williams. Several BLACK bystanders took  pictures of Denny but 
did not attempt to help him.  
After the beating, various BLACK men threw beer bottles at the unconscious  
Denny. Gary Williams, a BLACK drug addict who frequented the area, approached  
Denny and rifled through his pockets. Lance Parker, a BLACK process server for 
a  law firm, stopped near Denny and attempted to shoot the gas tank of 
Denny's  truck but missed. 
Paramedics who attended to Denny said he came very close to death. His skull  
was fractured in 91 places and pushed into the brain. His left eye was so 
badly  dislocated that it would have fallen into his sinus cavity had the 
surgeons not  replaced the crushed bone with a piece of plastic. A permanent crater 
remains in  his head despite efforts to correct it.

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

It's time to play it for keeps boys and girls. We have one of our most 
honered guests to date coming to pay N.E. Ohio for the first time in 
almost a decade. Once part of Cybersonik alongside Richie Hawtin and 
John Acquaviva we bring you

<img src="http://www.beyondbooking.com/artists/daniel_bell/daniel_bell_190.jpg">

Daniel Bell [DBX]
Daniel Bell is considered to be one of the pioneers of the minimal 
techno genre. Born in Sacramento, California, Bell grew up outside of 
Toronto, and later moved to Detroit where he collaborated with Richie 
Hawtin as Cybersonik for three years on Plus 8 records. In 1991, he 
started his own label, Accelerate, where he released a string of 
extremely influential releases as DBX.

Bell was influenced primarily by Chicago House as well as the works of 
Steve Reich and Philip Glass. His productions are characterized by 
minimalist house grooves accented by blips and bleeps. Some tracks also 
feature bizarre voice effects and eerie atmospherics such as "Losing 
Control," which caused a sensation when released in 1994.

In the mid to late 90's Bell moved behind the scenes to create 7th City 
Distribution which exclusively pressed and distributed Robert Hood's 
M-plant, Dopplereffekt's Dataphysix and Anthony Shakir's Frictional 
record labels, to name a few. He also launched Elevate, Harmonie Park 
and relaunched 7th City Records. Debut releases on these labels helped 
kick start the music careers of Todd Sines, Rick Wade, Theo Parrish and 
Shawn Rudiman among others.

In 2000, he relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first dj mix 
CD, "The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell," on Tresor Records to wide 
critical acclaim. 2003 brought a follow-up release on Logistic records, 
"The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back," and soon after a retrospective cd 
of older work was released: "Blip, Blurp, Bleep: The Music of Daniel 
Bell".

For the past few years Daniel has kept a heavy dj schedule that has 
brought him all over the world. In 2007, he took a step back from djing 
to focus on production and developing a live show that he's finally 
taking to the road.

In creating an enviroment for this event to truly deliver all the 
potential that techno can bring to the table we will be enlisting the 
help of some of the best sound engineers in the buisness bringing a semi 
of no hards bar chest compressing sound stage. No expense will be 
spared.

Coming to help us beat these speakers like their built to be beaten will 
be some of the family who have been dying to push air like this for a 
long time.

Sat Feb 09                    SHUT UP AND DANCE                       Akron

This event is part of the Animation and Gaming Ohio Convention 2008...

Animation and Gaming Ohio is a new type of Convention in which Animation 
and Gaming come together for 48 solid hours of uber craziness. It 
encompasses everything from your favorite anime to your favorite 
childhood cartoon, and your favorite street fighter game to your 
favorite collectible card game. If you can name it, this is the 
convention for them!

The idea to create a convention like Animation and Gaming Ohio came 
shortly after Cleveland's Colossal Convention 2006, in which a popular 
event called "Live Action Gaming" took place. It's creator, Jason 
Taylor, decided that it was high time for a new type of convention to 
arise. With the help of a few friends and the Random Battle Group, new 
ideas were born, and Jason was starting to think that the idea of 
bringing animation and gaming together would be great. Since then, many 
people have come to the helm, including Josh Farley, who is responsible 
for the majority of the advertising for the convention.

We here at Animation and Gaming Ohio (also dubbed "A & G Ohio") invite 
you to come and see exactly what we are all about during the weekend of 
February 8-10, 2008. With a bunch of new panels and some very special 
events, we are sure it would be very well worth your time and money to 
come see a new convention be born. So come, join our forums and post 
what you would like to see! After all, this convention is "by the fans, 
for the fans."

Check out www.aandgohio.com for more info on the Convention!!!

MacKenzie, and Fixx is a veritable production machine, with tracks out 
on Keith's Illeven:Eleven Recordings imprint as well. With over 150 
12-inch releases out and four massively-distributed CDs under his belt,

Joshua's gift for music dates back to his early childhood where his 
unique attention to detail was displayed at the age of 6 when he picked 
up a guitar and simply played it after watching his father. His talent 
thus grew later in life with his countless years of work on both the 
clarinet and the alto saxophone. It was obvious that this musical 
phenomena was destined for greatness. Falling in love with the EDM scene 
and music around the mid 2000, Joshua decided to take his musical 
experience to another level. Inspired by the epic sounds of Micro, and 
the dark sounds of Myth I S Josh gathered an assortment of records and 
began playing house parties in and around the south west ohio area under 
the moniker Oompa Loompa. It is under this name that josh released his 
first of many mix cds "Trance in da pants" which was able to land him a 
few spots on local lineups at EDM events. It was around this time as 
well that josh and long time friend and partner Tom Sawyer started 
Airplane Clique productions.

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and

Idiot,
I grew up on the east side of Cleveland (E185th, E156th, Arcade Ave) in the early 70's & 80's and watched a beautiful diverse
ethnic friendly neighborhood slowly get over taken and is what it is today.? A run down suburb of Cleveland.? BLACKS, WHITES, ASIAN
are all to fault and I've gotten over it.? It is what it is, life goes on and theres no stopping it.? Bask in the ambience or get the fuck out.
Who are you going to recommend for a candidate?? They are?all corporate drones.? Politics in this country will not change unless we look to alternative, independent candidates.
Romney & Paul are our only hope.? Get jesus fucking christ out of politics and run this biotch like a business.
You think Bush,?Reagan (thanks for NAFTA asshole, wonder why all the company's like Caterpillar have moved out of Euclid?) and Clinton were bad?? Just wait.
What's our pretty little president Clinton going to do when a nuke, that has been sitting in a warehouse long before 911, obtained from the USSR collapse, goes off
in the middle of a city.? The next four years are going to be jems.
Fuck off and Happy New Year cock suck.

Subject: {pb-cle} are we ready for a BLACK leader?




On April 29, 1992, at 5:39 PM, Reginald Oliver Denny loaded his red, 18-wheel truck with 27 tons of sand and began driving to a plant in Inglewood where the sand was due. At 6:46 p.m., after entering the intersection at Normandie, BLACK rioters threw rocks at his windows and he heard people shouting for him to stop. A BLACK man named Antoine Miller opened the truck door, giving others the chance to pull Denny out. Another BLACK man, Henry Keith Watson, then held Denny's head down with his foot. Denny, who had done nothing to provoke the violence, was kicked in the stomach. A BLACK man who had led a liquor store break-in earlier that day hurled a five-pound piece of medical equipment at Denny's head and hit him three times with a claw hammer. A BLACK man named Damian Monroe Williams (also known as "Football") then threw a slab of concrete at Denny's head and knocked him unconscious. Williams then did a victory dance over Denny. He then flashed gang signs at news helicopters, which were televising the events live, and pointed and laughed at Denny.? A BLACK man named Anthony Brown then spat on Denny and left with Williams. Several BLACK bystanders took pictures of Denny but did not attempt to help him. 
After the beating, various BLACK men threw beer bottles at the unconscious Denny. Gary Williams, a BLACK drug addict who frequented the area, approached Denny and rifled through his pockets. Lance Parker, a BLACK process server for a law firm, stopped near Denny and attempted to shoot the gas tank of Denny's truck but missed.

Paramedics who attended to Denny said he came very close to death. His skull was fractured in 91 places and pushed into the brain. His left eye was so badly dislocated that it would have fallen into his sinus cavity had the surgeons not replaced the crushed bone with a piece of plastic. A permanent crater remains in his head despite efforts to correct it.

 the riot in question was caused by white police officers getting off the
hook for beating up a black man.

it takes people getting pissed off to finally do something to incite a
change.

as for politicians, they're all bums, but the ones that entropy supports are
uber-bums...

:)  unless he's for huckabee this year, whom i will probably vote for on the
simple premise of chuck norris factor.  it's not like i can vote for james
traficant this year... still bummed to find out he didnt make the ticket.

You are an idiot. Seriously.
While you are off fucking yourself, perhaps you should play some of
your favorite old records... you know, those banging techno toons from
Detroit.... the ones that BLACK GUYS invented: House, Techno,
Drum-n-Bass, Ragga, Hip Hop, Rock and Roll.... all products of black
culture.

You suck.

Love, Your white meeker.

 Well just take a look at Africa. We don't owe the blacks anything.  Africa 
is the last place on earth anyone wants to be. They should be grateful  for the 
free ride over here. Instead of affirmative action lets give them a  state 
like the jews got Israel. They can have the entire continent of Africa.  You 
don't see hiring quotas for whites within the NBA of NFL.

Your 12-year-old assessment of "the way the world is" is duly noted.

Now please die in a fire.

I don't care if you're trolling or fer-serious...just shut the fuck up.

I graduated in 1992 the year of the Rodney King Riots. As for Hilary  1992 
was also the year of Dr Dre - The Chronic. One of the most influencial song  to 
me on the album was "Bitches Ain't Shit but Hoes and Tricks." I know this  
sounds strange that a racist would develop his opinion of women from gangster  
rap. I'm afraid since I haven't used MDMA in years I have returned to this  
mentality. I've replaced PLUR and hugs with hatred and violence. It feels  good.

I'm going to refer to this as the "reverse 187 effect." 187 = Murder.  People 
change. As a we can see when a male jungle producer that goes by 187 is  
transformed into a transtestical named Jordana.

Yeah...this type of blatant ignorance makes me think this person is too stupid to be trolling.  Fire death would help the gene pool.

I've been to Africa.  It was the most incredible place I've ever been and I would recommend that anyone with an adventurous spirit go there.  However there aren't many raves....so I guess its off topic;)

I don't care if you're trolling or fer-serious...just shut the fuck up.

<<A black with a muslim name for our leader. The rest of the world
will surely laugh at us.>>

As if they aren't already? That is, when they're not shaking their
heads in disbelief....hell, most days, I do too...usually when I hear
people like you talking.

In my view, 230+ years of rich white men leading has fucked this
country into the ground quite enough. I say it's time to give someone
else a go.

<<Jesus wasn't from Africa. Try and find 3 wise men or a virgin.>>

The same can be said for most of the United States.

Mer'ca....love it or leave it! Unless you have brown skin and/or pray
to a different God than me. Then, just leave it.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Feb 09                    SHUT UP AND DANCE                       Akron

This event is part of the Animation and Gaming Ohio Convention 2008...

Animation and Gaming Ohio is a new type of Convention in which Animation 
and Gaming come together for 48 solid hours of uber craziness. It 
encompasses everything from your favorite anime to your favorite 
childhood cartoon, and your favorite street fighter game to your 
favorite collectible card game. If you can name it, this is the 
convention for them!

The idea to create a convention like Animation and Gaming Ohio came 
shortly after Cleveland's Colossal Convention 2006, in which a popular 
event called "Live Action Gaming" took place. It's creator, Jason 
Taylor, decided that it was high time for a new type of convention to 
arise. With the help of a few friends and the Random Battle Group, new 
ideas were born, and Jason was starting to think that the idea of 
bringing animation and gaming together would be great. Since then, many 
people have come to the helm, including Josh Farley, who is responsible 
for the majority of the advertising for the convention.

We here at Animation and Gaming Ohio (also dubbed "A & G Ohio") invite 
you to come and see exactly what we are all about during the weekend of 
February 8-10, 2008. With a bunch of new panels and some very special 
events, we are sure it would be very well worth your time and money to 
come see a new convention be born. So come, join our forums and post 
what you would like to see! After all, this convention is "by the fans, 
for the fans."

Check out www.aandgohio.com for more info on the Convention!!!

Fri Feb 15               GALACTIC ASSDRAGON CLASSIC              Pittsburgh

This competition is free to enter and anyone with a computer can join.

The rules for this competition are the same as those in the previous 
events (and like before, these rules are likely to be broken by the more 
nefarious combatants). This battle is being fought to see who can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. As a combatant, you can only use a laptop 
or desktop computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no 
traditional instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug 
into the RCA input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount 
of material ahead of time and use any software you want, although you 
are encouraged to improvise or create material on the fly. Using 
material from other artists is grounds for removal (this rule is 
potentially misleading since you can use samples). Like the previous 
battles, this is not a Traktor, mashup, or DJ competition: make your own 
shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many combatants sign-up, 
everyone who enters gets up to 10 minutes to play in the opening round. 
There will be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, 
you can start setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in 
front of you is done, you're on the clock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 
combatants will move on to the semi-final round where they will have 10 
minutes to annihilate their competitors. At the completion of the 
semi-round, the top 2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 
minute shot before one triumphant champion is declared. The winner 
receives the highly coveted Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their 
own 7" record release on No Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the No Room for Talent Records 
camp, dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.


Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you are able to 
transform the crowd into a churning sea of ravenous barbarians. Getting 
the crowd to gently bob their heads isn't worth any points. Breakcore, 
hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise are what's called for. While 
vocals are not explicitly prohibited, may the elder gods devour the 
souls of any who assault the judges with ghastly singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from all the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. The more you distract everyone from your awful music, the 
more points you get. If you look like you're checking your email during 
your lunch break at work, you're going to do terrible.

diverse as he is skilled! His repertoire of past events includes sets

Joshua's gift for music dates back to his early childhood where his 
unique attention to detail was displayed at the age of 6 when he picked 
up a guitar and simply played it after watching his father. His talent 
thus grew later in life with his countless years of work on both the 
clarinet and the alto saxophone. It was obvious that this musical 
phenomena was destined for greatness. Falling in love with the EDM scene 
and music around the mid 2000, Joshua decided to take his musical 
experience to another level. Inspired by the epic sounds of Micro, and 
the dark sounds of Myth I S Josh gathered an assortment of records and 
began playing house parties in and around the south west ohio area under 
the moniker Oompa Loompa. It is under this name that josh released his 
first of many mix cds "Trance in da pants" which was able to land him a 
few spots on local lineups at EDM events. It was around this time as

Sat Feb 16                     DEREK PLASLAIKO                    Cleveland

$5

Sat Feb 16 2008

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we're finally answering 
your calls. One of the most respected techno acts coming from the US


Derek Plaslakio [Detroit / NYC]
Ghostly International, Wolf + Lamb

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall 
or record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig 
deeper into the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring 
labels, bucking trends and are forever on a quest to find the perfect 
record. The ones that make the staunchest of chin stroking, note taking 
trainspotters lose their shit on the dancefloor, hanging on every record 
from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen 
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7.s, 
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit 
to the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of 
success. He quietly paid his dues on Detroit.s rave circuit, and was a 
crucial piece of the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Analog parties 
of the mid-nineties. He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking 
DJ sets that were clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This 
combination resulted in a residency for Family, the weekly party at 
Detroit.s legendary Motor.

With a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful, 
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; 
sharing the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin 
Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was 
also during that time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at 
the inaugural edition of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit.s 
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T. 
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to 
head east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice 
of the Motor City to the Big Apple.

Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at the Bunker (Subtonic) in 
NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb monthly parties. 
Most recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006 .Best Of. poll 
as New York.s Best Techno DJ.

Sets are available here -> http://plaslaiko.net/me/

Local support from
Jamie Tyler [Tek-Know | Cleveland]

are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday

throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

What's going on these days in Pittsburgh?  I'm seriously considering
moving back that way, and curious if there's any small shindigs worth
getting out of the house and drinking a beer.

I havent been out to an 'electronica' club in ages... theres still stuff here to do tho, the North Shore is gettin better all the time, if you can handle some of the pretentious assholes and snobs that frequent that area.  

Theres other bars poppin up around town that are worth checkin out too.

And Pittsburgh still kicks Cleveland's ass.  That in itself is enuf for me, but I am moving to Tallahassee next year to attend Florida St.

Yea, well the tail is better @ FSU than anywhere LOL.

the ratio there is something like 3:1 women/men... and theyre all hot lol

Also, random thought I had earlier today:

'Techno' was mortally wounded, and nearly died completely in the mainstream  U.S. music culture when Eminem said to Moby in 'Without Me', '... youre too old, let go, its over, nobody listen to Techno!'

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

deserves. We have some of the best Dj'z (REPRESENTIN' NY, CA, OH, MI all

MC'z ( Teddy & Yoda) around to throw down. Let's make it happen. Get at 
DamnPanic or Senor Butts or Inspekda Breakz or Dj Nimbus or Uncle Matt 
if you are intrested in helping promote. Remember: It's all about the 
LOVE and the MUZIK! LEAVE THE DRAMA @ HOME!!!!! That's what this party 
is about:

Sat Feb 09                    SHUT UP AND DANCE                       Akron

This event is part of the Animation and Gaming Ohio Convention 2008...

Animation and Gaming Ohio is a new type of Convention in which Animation 
and Gaming come together for 48 solid hours of uber craziness. It 
encompasses everything from your favorite anime to your favorite 
childhood cartoon, and your favorite street fighter game to your 
favorite collectible card game. If you can name it, this is the 
convention for them!

The idea to create a convention like Animation and Gaming Ohio came 
shortly after Cleveland's Colossal Convention 2006, in which a popular 
event called "Live Action Gaming" took place. It's creator, Jason 
Taylor, decided that it was high time for a new type of convention to 
arise. With the help of a few friends and the Random Battle Group, new 
ideas were born, and Jason was starting to think that the idea of 
bringing animation and gaming together would be great. Since then, many 
people have come to the helm, including Josh Farley, who is responsible 
for the majority of the advertising for the convention.

We here at Animation and Gaming Ohio (also dubbed "A & G Ohio") invite 
you to come and see exactly what we are all about during the weekend of 
February 8-10, 2008. With a bunch of new panels and some very special 
events, we are sure it would be very well worth your time and money to 
come see a new convention be born. So come, join our forums and post 
what you would like to see! After all, this convention is "by the fans, 
for the fans."

Check out www.aandgohio.com for more info on the Convention!!!

Fri Feb 15               GALACTIC ASSDRAGON CLASSIC              Pittsburgh

This competition is free to enter and anyone with a computer can join.

The rules for this competition are the same as those in the previous 
events (and like before, these rules are likely to be broken by the more 
nefarious combatants). This battle is being fought to see who can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. As a combatant, you can only use a laptop 
or desktop computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no 
traditional instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug 
into the RCA input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount 
of material ahead of time and use any software you want, although you 
are encouraged to improvise or create material on the fly. Using 
material from other artists is grounds for removal (this rule is 
potentially misleading since you can use samples). Like the previous 
battles, this is not a Traktor, mashup, or DJ competition: make your own 
shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many combatants sign-up, 
everyone who enters gets up to 10 minutes to play in the opening round. 
There will be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, 
you can start setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in 
front of you is done, you're on the clock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 
combatants will move on to the semi-final round where they will have 10 
minutes to annihilate their competitors. At the completion of the 
semi-round, the top 2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 
minute shot before one triumphant champion is declared. The winner 
receives the highly coveted Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their 
own 7" record release on No Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the No Room for Talent Records 
camp, dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.


Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you are able to 
transform the crowd into a churning sea of ravenous barbarians. Getting 
the crowd to gently bob their heads isn't worth any points. Breakcore, 
hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise are what's called for. While 
vocals are not explicitly prohibited, may the elder gods devour the 
souls of any who assault the judges with ghastly singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from all the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. The more you distract everyone from your awful music, the 
more points you get. If you look like you're checking your email during 
your lunch break at work, you're going to do terrible.

9PM. 21+. $3 (however, everyone who enters the battle gets in for free).

diverse as he is skilled! His repertoire of past events includes sets

As one of the pioneers of the US funky breaks movement, DJ Fixx has

Running his own independent monthly breakbeat label, Bottom-End Records,

continues to do so making it one of the top five best-selling breakbeat 
labels in the country. Prior to the legacy of Bottom-End, Fixx produced 
over 75 breakbeat anthems on the classic Kaleidoscope Music label over 
the span of three years. Add to that his current involvement as half of 
the production duo 'KMFX,' with his long-time counterpart Keith 
MacKenzie, and Fixx is a veritable production machine, with tracks out 
on Keith's Illeven:Eleven Recordings imprint as well. With over 150 
12-inch releases out and four massively-distributed CDs under his belt, 
DJ Fixx has compiled one of the largest bodies of breakbeat production 
work to date, and with that comes one of the largest followings in the 
US.

If you know Hytek, you know his passion for electronic music. No matter 
what environment, he relates to everyone listening with various twists. 
When you ask Hytek what style he spins, he answers with Dance Music..he 
is not particular to one style. You can catch him incorporating techno, 
house, progressive, tribal, electro, minimal, breaks, and trance into 
every set..and you would not know the difference.its all dance music to 
him. If you had to categorize it to one sound..you could call it Big 
Room. You can always tell Hytek is on the decks when you hear big room 
build-ups with thumping tribal bass lines. Hytek started dj-ing for his 
friends at house parties back in high school. Eight years later you can 
find him downtown in the city spinning or at any underground event 
happening in the MidWest. Hytek made his mark with the Acomplis 
Productions campouts of 2006 and the Kickback events of 2006 hosted by 
Infared Productions. Now in 2007, Hytek has joined forces with Infared, 
GTP, and Abduction Radio as a resident. Hytek has hosted residencies 
from West Palm Beach, Fl, to his home-Chicago. Expect nothing less than 
remarkable things in the future.

Joshua's gift for music dates back to his early childhood where his 
unique attention to detail was displayed at the age of 6 when he picked 
up a guitar and simply played it after watching his father. His talent 
thus grew later in life with his countless years of work on both the 
clarinet and the alto saxophone. It was obvious that this musical 
phenomena was destined for greatness. Falling in love with the EDM scene 
and music around the mid 2000, Joshua decided to take his musical 
experience to another level. Inspired by the epic sounds of Micro, and 
the dark sounds of Myth I S Josh gathered an assortment of records and 
began playing house parties in and around the south west ohio area under 
the moniker Oompa Loompa. It is under this name that josh released his 
first of many mix cds "Trance in da pants" which was able to land him a 
few spots on local lineups at EDM events. It was around this time as 
well that josh and long time friend and partner Tom Sawyer started 
Airplane Clique productions.

Sat Feb 16                     DEREK PLASLAIKO                    Cleveland

$5

Sat Feb 16 2008

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we're finally answering 
your calls. One of the most respected techno acts coming from the US


Derek Plaslakio [Detroit / NYC]
Ghostly International, Wolf + Lamb

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall 
or record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig 
deeper into the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring 
labels, bucking trends and are forever on a quest to find the perfect 
record. The ones that make the staunchest of chin stroking, note taking 
trainspotters lose their shit on the dancefloor, hanging on every record 
from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen 
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7.s, 
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit 
to the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of 
success. He quietly paid his dues on Detroit.s rave circuit, and was a 
crucial piece of the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Analog parties 
of the mid-nineties. He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking 
DJ sets that were clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This 
combination resulted in a residency for Family, the weekly party at 
Detroit.s legendary Motor.

With a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful, 
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; 
sharing the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin 
Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was 
also during that time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at 
the inaugural edition of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit.s 
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T. 
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to 
head east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice 
of the Motor City to the Big Apple.

Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at the Bunker (Subtonic) in 
NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb monthly parties. 
Most recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006 .Best Of. poll 
as New York.s Best Techno DJ.

Sets are available here -> http://plaslaiko.net/me/

EZ Sniper has been playing ragga jungle music over the last decade and 
will be bringing some never before played original ragga jungle tunes 
for his second return appearance in Ohio.  He is currently producing 
mashed-up ragga-jungle tunes with serious amen edits, heavy basslines 
and a new school jungle meets old school jungle feel. As a DJ, his sets 
bring a blend of hard, gunman dancehall and ruff ragga-jungle tunes with 
sound clash vibes.  EZ Sniper's label: Lion heart Records is distributed 
worldwide.  New vinyl releases will be available early this year.  Ohio 
be prepared for brand new never before heard dubplates, specials,

up, and ragga, to pure mashed up amen mayhem, he keeps you on your toes 
with anticipation. In one set you will most likely hear a lot of tunes 
that you have never heard before, or have not heard since 1995, quite a 
few original dubplates, and special voicings, as well as some of the

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

i miss seeing a hot woman every once in a while.

Hell, on a recent trip where i drove through manhattan, I saw more 
attractive females in 20 minutes driving through to long island than 
I have in the last 3 years in this city.

bad demographics.  PITT does a decent job of importing young girls 
temporarily, but my tolerance for teenage babble and pseudo drama 
isn't what it used to be.

I don't mind pittsburgh, just don't expect to be entertained

I love visiting NYC... but moving there seems suicide to me.

Dunno.  The college-educated parts of Pittsburgh always had some hotness 
around, as of five years ago.  The yinzer 'burbs, not so much.

O yeah, there's a white castle like 10 minutes from where I work.  Have 
gone there a few times for lunch.  It's funny asking the receptionist 
and women in the office.  They're like "eww, that's gross... I only eat 
white castle after drinking"  And then you have the guys like me that 
are like "YEAH WHITE CASTLE!"  Hmm... too bad I don't think they have a 
white castle in Boardman.  they have pretty much every other place on 
the strip that's like a mile from here.

I have to drive 20 minutes to get to the nearest White Castle, but on
occasion I'll head out there. W

hen I lived in Columbus, however, there was a White Castle right across
the street from me and I used to get *breakfast* there. Everyone I worked
with thought that was sick. Meanwhile, everyone I worked with was a
stupid, pretty, college-aged female since I managed a flock of them at
Express. Bitches were too clueless to appreciate the White Castle
goodness.

Hate to say it, but Shadow/Cut Chemist: NOT GOOD THIS TIME OUT.  It was 
a self-indulgent wankfest of them showing what records they had, without 
much turntablism, with almost no flow.  I was really, super, hugely 
disappointed.  Also, no material from The Outsider.

That said, KID KOALA was insane.  Perhaps the most talent I've seen 
displayed by a turntablist.  The Xecutioners should watch him play Moon 
River, then retire in shame.

Subject: {pb-cle} Anyone -- Good job markets out west?

My mom is looking for a new job and she'd prefer to move to California,
Washington, or Texas. She's a former IT manager at Allstate with degrees
in English, Accounting, and Business Administration.

She's already looking in the Sacramento and San Antonio areas, but throw
me some more cities ... other than LA (which she has no interest in moving
to), what cities do you consider the best for getting job in these days?

If and when she moves, I will be going with her. I figure I can work any
shit job until something better pans out.

Thanks.

Amanda

Colorado's job market has been great (Denver/Boulder)....unless you're a mortgage broker or real estate agent.

I've had two accountants leave our firm in the past year because the competition is heavy for firms demanding accounting help.

Oklahoma has a huge medical industry shortage.

South Dakota has a general worker shortage as well.

Hehe, yeah, we're hoping to leave "the heartland" as well. Just a few too
many racist, sexist, 1950's-style thinkers 'round these parts. The whole
Midwest is just entirely too socially conservative for my family's tastes.
(We are originally from Seattle.)

Have you ever *been* to South Dakota? I've driven through it a few times.
There's *nothing* there to look at.

I had said it off list, will repeat it on.

The biggest tech industry in America is San Francisco.  The market there 
is incredibly strong, the people are free thinking, and the weather's 
nice.  On the minus side, you will probably never own a house close to 
the city.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Anyone -- Good job markets out west?

Actually, from my best friend from high school who lives in Vegas, it's  
actually quite hard to find work there.  He played poker to survive for  
almost a year.  He has a bachelor's of business from UNH, and tons of  
bartending experience, which isnt special, but it's not nothing.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Feb 01                     AURAL FIXXATION                      Detroit

All right all you party people. It's on! Dj'z, MC'z, and venue (WORKS) 
are booked and fliers are being made as we speak. This is going to be a 
one of a kind Phat Azz Breakz and D&B party (w/ a slice of Electro). 
It's an honor for me to be a part of the DamnPanic krew and to help 
bring one of the best parties Detroit's going to see in 08' to all my 
Detroit Electronic Family. For all of you that know us, you know how 
it's going down, for all of you that don't, you will soon.
We're looking for some foot souljaz to help us promote this beast of a 
party and help make sure we get the turnout that a party of this stature 
deserves. We have some of the best Dj'z (REPRESENTIN' NY, CA, OH, MI all 
soon to be released) on the Breakz and the D&B side, and the two best 
MC'z ( Teddy & Yoda) around to throw down. Let's make it happen. Get at 
DamnPanic or Senor Butts or Inspekda Breakz or Dj Nimbus or Uncle Matt 
if you are intrested in helping promote. Remember: It's all about the 
LOVE and the MUZIK! LEAVE THE DRAMA @ HOME!!!!! That's what this party 
is about:
The Love
The Muzik
The People
THE FUNK!

Sat Feb 09                    SHUT UP AND DANCE                       Akron

This event is part of the Animation and Gaming Ohio Convention 2008...

Animation and Gaming Ohio is a new type of Convention in which Animation 
and Gaming come together for 48 solid hours of uber craziness. It 
encompasses everything from your favorite anime to your favorite 
childhood cartoon, and your favorite street fighter game to your 
favorite collectible card game. If you can name it, this is the 
convention for them!

The idea to create a convention like Animation and Gaming Ohio came 
shortly after Cleveland's Colossal Convention 2006, in which a popular 
event called "Live Action Gaming" took place. It's creator, Jason 
Taylor, decided that it was high time for a new type of convention to 
arise. With the help of a few friends and the Random Battle Group, new 
ideas were born, and Jason was starting to think that the idea of 
bringing animation and gaming together would be great. Since then, many 
people have come to the helm, including Josh Farley, who is responsible 
for the majority of the advertising for the convention.

We here at Animation and Gaming Ohio (also dubbed "A & G Ohio") invite 
you to come and see exactly what we are all about during the weekend of 
February 8-10, 2008. With a bunch of new panels and some very special 
events, we are sure it would be very well worth your time and money to 
come see a new convention be born. So come, join our forums and post 
what you would like to see! After all, this convention is "by the fans, 
for the fans."

Check out www.aandgohio.com for more info on the Convention!!!

Fri Feb 15               GALACTIC ASSDRAGON CLASSIC              Pittsburgh

This competition is free to enter and anyone with a computer can join.

The rules for this competition are the same as those in the previous 
events (and like before, these rules are likely to be broken by the more 
nefarious combatants). This battle is being fought to see who can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. As a combatant, you can only use a laptop 
or desktop computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no 
traditional instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug 
into the RCA input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount 
of material ahead of time and use any software you want, although you 
are encouraged to improvise or create material on the fly. Using 
material from other artists is grounds for removal (this rule is 
potentially misleading since you can use samples). Like the previous 
battles, this is not a Traktor, mashup, or DJ competition: make your own 
shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many combatants sign-up, 
everyone who enters gets up to 10 minutes to play in the opening round. 
There will be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, 
you can start setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in 
front of you is done, you're on the clock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 
combatants will move on to the semi-final round where they will have 10 
minutes to annihilate their competitors. At the completion of the 
semi-round, the top 2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 
minute shot before one triumphant champion is declared. The winner 
receives the highly coveted Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their 
own 7" record release on No Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the No Room for Talent Records 
camp, dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.


Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you are able to 
transform the crowd into a churning sea of ravenous barbarians. Getting 
the crowd to gently bob their heads isn't worth any points. Breakcore, 
hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise are what's called for. While 
vocals are not explicitly prohibited, may the elder gods devour the 
souls of any who assault the judges with ghastly singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from all the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. The more you distract everyone from your awful music, the 
more points you get. If you look like you're checking your email during 
your lunch break at work, you're going to do terrible.

9PM. 21+. $3 (however, everyone who enters the battle gets in for free).

Joshua's gift for music dates back to his early childhood where his 
unique attention to detail was displayed at the age of 6 when he picked

clarinet and the alto saxophone. It was obvious that this musical 
phenomena was destined for greatness. Falling in love with the EDM scene 
and music around the mid 2000, Joshua decided to take his musical 
experience to another level. Inspired by the epic sounds of Micro, and 
the dark sounds of Myth I S Josh gathered an assortment of records and 
began playing house parties in and around the south west ohio area under 
the moniker Oompa Loompa. It is under this name that josh released his 
first of many mix cds "Trance in da pants" which was able to land him a 
few spots on local lineups at EDM events. It was around this time as

Sat Feb 16                     DEREK PLASLAIKO                    Cleveland

$5

Sat Feb 16 2008

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we're finally answering 
your calls. One of the most respected techno acts coming from the US


Derek Plaslakio [Detroit / NYC]
Ghostly International, Wolf + Lamb

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall 
or record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig 
deeper into the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring 
labels, bucking trends and are forever on a quest to find the perfect 
record. The ones that make the staunchest of chin stroking, note taking 
trainspotters lose their shit on the dancefloor, hanging on every record 
from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen 
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7.s, 
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit 
to the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of 
success. He quietly paid his dues on Detroit.s rave circuit, and was a 
crucial piece of the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Analog parties 
of the mid-nineties. He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking 
DJ sets that were clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This 
combination resulted in a residency for Family, the weekly party at 
Detroit.s legendary Motor.

With a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful, 
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; 
sharing the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin 
Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was 
also during that time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at 
the inaugural edition of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit.s 
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T. 
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to 
head east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice 
of the Motor City to the Big Apple.

Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at the Bunker (Subtonic) in 
NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb monthly parties. 
Most recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006 .Best Of. poll 
as New York.s Best Techno DJ.

Sets are available here -> http://plaslaiko.net/me/

Fri Mar 14                      I HATE TECHNO                    Pittsburgh

I HATE TECHNO!!!!!!!

After a long hiatus, Full House Productions is back and proud to 
announce our eighth event here in Pittsburgh, 'I Hate Techno'.

In an on-going effort to expand musical horizons and educate people on 
the music we love so much, we are throwing an event focusing on possibly 
the most important genre of electronic music- techno.

>From acid to Detroit, minimal to tech-house, we have all the bases 
covered to help you explore the different sounds of techno, and 
understand how the sound has evolved and its impact on every genre of 
electronic music.

Our line-up will feature live PAs, as well as 4 DJ's, all right here 
from Pittsburgh.

The full line-up is:

Shawn Rudiman- Live PA/Technoir Audio/7th City Recordings 
(Detroit)/Finest Blend Recordings (Stockholm)/Pittsburgh

Thumptek- Live PA/Iron City Acid/Pittsburgh

Paul Alexander- Humanaut/Pittsburgh

Jason Cuban- Full House/Pittsburgh

Adam Ratana- 412DNB/Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh

Jwan Allen- Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh


'I Hate Techno' will be held Friday, March 14th, 2008.
Doors will open at 10pm and the event will end at 3am.
This will be an 18+ event, and 21+ with ID to drink.
Cost at the door is $10.

This event is being held at the Braddock Elks Lodge, 424 Library Road, 
Braddock, PA. This is a prime location, only about 15 or 20 minutes from 
downtown.

The venue features a stocked bar with drink specials, a kitchen that 
will cook food as late as you can eat it, and has its own parking lot 
around back to save you the hassle of parking.

The Braddock Police Department will be providing an off-duty officer to 
ensure everyone has a safe, drama-free time.

Check Lolli.org as well as MySpace.com/FullHouseProductions for more 
info, and be on the lookout for the flyer which should hit the streets 
in a couple of weeks.

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs
