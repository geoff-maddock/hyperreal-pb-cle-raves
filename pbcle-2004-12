			I havent' been booted.  I thought for sure after that last one I would be.Maybe trout just hasn't seen it yet.  Anyway, i didn't make any valid points or anything, and I didn't really attack anyone personally.  I do that shit with a sense of humour of course. Gotta be able to make fun of yourself before you can make fun of others I guess.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  So far all but one person
thinks this is a good idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Frank'e is a man who sits high atop the psychedelic
pyramid. He has been a mainstay in the psychedelic
scene for over 10 years with both the Kox Box and
Saiko-Pod projects, playing countless live gigs in all
corners of our world. After releasing several singles
on Sven Vaths seminal label HartHouse, the Koxbox

culture on labels like BlueRoom, Tip, Dragonfly,
etc... Having worked with such artists as Juno
Reactor, X-Dream and Eat Static. They have been
described as "Probably the most in-yer-face
psychedelic outfit ever,these Danish floor fillers
Koxbox are not known for pulling any punches."

*****************CANCELLED********************

Evolution and Breakline Crew Present... ELEMENTS OF LIFE

FREE GIVEAWAYS BY UFO Clothing!!

Friday, December 10th 2004
Cleveland, Ohio

**IN THIER FIRST EVER PREFORMANCE TOGETHER***
-XAVIER, KOS, AND MC FLIPSIDE (House, Hard House, Live PA)
Xavier and Kos are artists that are one of a kind. When the table is set 
and the crowd is in full force, they drop the high-energy funk that 
crushes dances floors and makes the walls shake. Now with the addition 
of MC Flipsides the party is sure to be hyped!

-Kaos - (Philly - Human Imprint, Habit, Violence, Atlas, Circle, 
Breakline Crew) DnB
Fresh off tour with Dieselboy and a nationally publicized tour sponsored 
by SALEM, Kaos has maintained his status as one of the key figures of 
the Human Imprint label as well as having releases out or slated on 
Violence, Atlas, Renegade Hardware, Habit and Circle, as well as 
remixing tunes for drum and bass greats such as Bad Company. Recently 
featured on the cover of the d'n'b publication Rinse Magazine, Kaos is 
still holding tight as production partner to Dieselboy.

-Annalyze (Rochester, NY - Stanton, Breakline Crew) Breakbeat turntablist
NY's own DJ Annalyze has played all over the US & Canada alongside DJ's 
Baby Anne, Shortee, Q-bert, Rap, Aphrodite, Jackal, Danny the Wildchild 
& much more . She has made appearance at the Winter NAMM show in 2003 & 
2004 and also did spot dates for The VANS Warp Tour in 2002 & 2003. 
Earning a sponsorship by Stanton Magnetics, Anna & her scratch partner 
DJ Shortee form Stanton’s first female scratch duo "Twice as Nice.” 
Anna combines breakbeat and electro with DMC style trickery & is known 
for rocking the crowd!.

-DJ Booth (Louisville, KY – Urban Loops, UFO Jeans, 4-Score) House
Fists in the air: Chaos reigns. For 8 years DJ Booth has dominated the 
midwest, headlining with international acts and struggling for what he 
now holds so dear – an extensive play history of dates nationally and 
internationally, an insurmountable fan base, multiple original 
compositions released nationwide, six mixed CD's, an appointment as a 
promotional rep by the UFO clothing company, and a rockin' remix of "Up 
to You" by Robbie Hardkiss of the famous Hardkiss brothers.

-Rob Riddum (Cleveland – J&N Media) Dnb/Hip-Hop turntablist
One of the key figures of the Element Squad returns to Cleveland. While 
in LA, Rob was working out of the old Beastie Boys’ studio “Grand 
Royale” where his main project was www.bradleyhiphop.com. Rob recently 
took home 3rd place at the Salt Lake City DMC. Come see this old skool 
turntablist wreck the decks.

-Kryteria (Curtis R & Patrick Felony – Miami – Breakline Crew) DnB
Playing prestigious events like Ultra Music Festival, Global Gathering, 
and Magical Maydaze has many djs and producers stateside and worldwide 
supporting this dynamic duo by playing their tunes and crowds all over 
are eating them up! With the likes of Karl K and Kaos behind these 
original bad boys none can contest!

-Ewun & Code-D (Rochester, NY – Evol Intent Recordings, Rocdnb, 
Skyehigh, Breakline Crew, La Selva) DnB/Dancehall/Turntablism
Ewun and Code-D are two of NY’s most versatile dj's. Known for creative 
mixes and impressive scratch abilities, these two have grown to become 
professionals behind the decks. Code-D has mastered the ability to 
switch styles with ease and his scratching skills are sharp. Ewun has 
just been signed to Evol Intent Recordings, with other releases in the 
works on some of the industries top labels. With DJ support from Evol 
Intent, Tech Itch, Dylan, B-Key, just to name a few, expect to hear a 
lot of noise from this rising artist.

-The Lady Foursquare - (Louisville, KY - UFO Jeans) House
Name another woman who can hold it down right beside Paul Johnson after 
DEMF 2002, tag with Trevor Lamont (Teamsters), share a residency with 
DJs Kit Chaps of VHS or Beta (Astralwerks) and rock the main stage next 
to Terry Mullan, Diego Ro-k and Dieselboy: Foursquare is supporting UFO 
Jeans and her CD, "What Happened?" this fall.

-Jon Doe ( Skratch Fienz / Cleveland) DNB, Hip Hop, Turntablism
Jon Doe is one of the most talented DJ's in Cleveland and yet unknown to 
those outside Cleveland. Jon Doe has been spinning for over 10 years now 
and continues to progress every day. Jon Doe works seven days a week, 
almost twelve hours a day, but he always finds time to get out and play, 
doing what he loves most, blowing ur mind. Talented in so many different 
areas of music Jon Doe is sure to impress!

-Robtronix and MC Barrenzemo (Koala Tea / P3 - DNB & MC) Cleveland
His funky flavor will captivate you within the first second of hearing 
him. Don't let him fool ya by the "i'm a nice boy" smile, like anyone of 
us we have a bad side and he puts that into his music. His thoughts are 
the drums and bass, his voice is the scratch.

-Shagge (Breaks) Cleveland
Shagge is one of the most amazing Breaks DJ's u will ever see...No more 
needs to be said!

-DJ Moose (Break Beat Militia / Breaks, Jump Up Jungle) Cleveland
Moose's unique style sprouts from his hip-hop influence. Blending 
hip-hop with breaks and jungle as well as keeping the crowd entertained 
has been moose's goal and motivation from the start. "All I want to do 
is make the whole crowd bounce, yall!", a sample of Snoop Doggy Dogg in 
a J-Smooth track, is what Moose uses as a slogan for every performance.

Fri Dec 10                        JOHN DEBO                        Columbus

 ~~ Friday December 10th ~~

 ~~ Reticent Recordings ~~

 ~~ Global Nightclub ~~
 
 
 
 ~ Featuring...

    John Debo ~ SQ1 Recordkings, Bedrock, Yoshitoshi ~
   
    For John Debo, his first UK tour in 1992 (albeit a couch tour) 
developed into much more. Crashing on the couch of one Dave Seaman, one 
half of Brothers in Rhythm and A&R Director for the highly profiled 
Stress Records, John sat back and enjoyed the latest tunes from Dave and 
his label. As John happened to have a cassette of his new production 
work, he left it with Dave to enjoy. Days later John was offered a 
record deal for his Mindwarp project and proceeded to release new tunes 
on Stress. 
 
Founding two of Boston's pioneering club nights - Chrome & Avaland 
were conceived as conduits to bring forward thinking DJs and upfront 
dance music from around the world to Boston. His vision is global - not 
provincial. Chrome quickly garnered a reputation of being one of THE 
club nights in the US and Avaland was selected by Mixer Magazine as the 
#1 club in America for 2002.
 
The spell that he casts over dance floors has been felt worldwide with 
seminal gigs at Avalon in Boston & LA, Spundae in San Francisco & 
Chicago, Space in Miami, Aria & Stereo in Montreal, Koolhaus in Toronto 
as well as Bedrock & Renaissance in the UK and Space in Ibiza to name a 
few. His sound has been captured on two mix CDs released in 2001: Chrome 
01 on Bliss and Logic Trance 5 on Logic 3000.
 
Given the success of his debut material on Stress, it should be no 
surprise that John Debo has found a home for his other work. Remixes 
have been released on Bedrock & Yoshitoshi as well as an original 
collaboration 'Deported' with Steve Porter on Bedrock. Past production 
includes remixes for the likes of Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Blur, The 
Charlatans UK, Candyland, Pendulum and My Friend Sam featuring Viola 
Wills, Debo has managed to bring his touch to a quirky bunch of classic 
tunes.
 
John has recently left Boston and relocated to sunny Orlando Florida to 
focus on his true passion - the music. The move allows him to fully 
explore his artistic mind and immerse himself in writing, production and 
DJing. .
 

 ~ Also featuring...

    Reticent ~ www.reticentrecordings.com ~ Downtown Entertainment ~
 
    Reticent Recordings formed early as an idea in 1997. Then finally 
became a reality in 2003.  The main purpose of Reticent Recordings is to 
be unique, and unlike any other label. Reticent Recordings is about the 
music, plain and simple. Reticent plans to distribute quality sounds, 
feature up and coming artists, all with a strong focus on the art and 
talent of the artists. 
 
Reticent are two American producers originally from Dayton, Ohio now 
residing in Tampa, Florida.  Fredrick Gablemann and Drew Whitehead aka 
Guru were relative unknowns when first signed but their sound and grasp 
of production is truly exceptional. Fredrick's first release under his 
own name was huge and received massive top level support from names such 
as Sean Cusick, Lee Burridge, and Jimmy Van M.  With only three releases 
under their belts Reticent, has already been reviewed in Mixer, M8, and 
DJ Times. Their tracks have reached the play lists of such giants as 
Sasha, Danny Tenaglia, Steve Lawler, Danny Howells,  Anthony Pappa, and 
John Debo.

SCAN 7 : DETROIT, MICHIGAN
www.scan7.com : www.tresorberlin.de : www.undergroundresistance.com

In their first ever Philadelphia exhibition, Scan 7 is coming straight
out of Detroit with a hardware based "Live PA" and their own hypnotic
visuals. Remaining hidden behind their ninja-like appearances, these
anonymous heroes will provide a safe passage out of the sound slavery
of corporate programming.

The true identity of Scan 7 remains a mystery.  Always performing
masked -- a proof of their link with Detroit's powerhouse Underground
Resistance -- they believe it's important not who you see but what you
hear.  Their dark and funky dance floor music and incredible
imaginations have brought them to the most credible underground labels
in the world: Tresor, UR, SID, FCOM, Elypsia, and their own label,
Cratesavers.

Info:

Legowelt
    Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases most of his
music. What Music you might ask??? Well a hybrid form of slam jack The
Hague electronix combined with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic
ghetto technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more! You can't
quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell slams the pit!
    Already a few years in the business Legowelt has released a dozen or
so projects on various formats, most of them on good ol' vinyl released
on homebase Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering electronic
music label. Sometimes these tracks spin out of the obscurity like an
asteroid from a spacebelt and fly straight into the charts; such an
event happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of the year 2002
by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
    Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies the
adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic contact with the sounds
of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably
his all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley
Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers. Later on this palette of
influences grew with early Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff
from The Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked deep
music he could get his hands on.
    But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere in the early
90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit Moebius' on the radio. A punky
palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made
with machines which were found next to the garbage can. Shocked in awe
he heard that this music came out of The Hague, Holland The very same
city he lived in! Put on the right track by this fact he stumbled into
the Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of contemporary autistic
freaked music lovers who looked beyond all the bland house and dance
music that ruled the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more unknown sounds
such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco which
production secrets were closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the
first vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled Italo Chicago
combi which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as 'Stumvogel'
and 'Total Pussy Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
    Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your mind! Empty
cold pametex-style electro from the nordic territories, a sinister film
noir movie soundtrack, chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
    Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of the staccato
minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected melodies and haunting tensions
in between beats. Orgue Electronique is not only known for the releases
he did on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That Never
Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album) and various
compilations, but also for his collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker
Records. Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage, who did releases
on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared on the DJ Hell mix CD on React.
Besides all this, Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to Detroit, from Tokyo
to New York, sharing the stage with many well known artists.

Catnip
    Catnip is the mysterious international team of producers bringing
you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
    In the summer of love TLR started playing at punkparties in youth
homes that were later closed for asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded
Global Darkness and became involved in organising underground Jungle
parties in the totally freaked out and fucked up squat scene of the West
Coast of Holland area; filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and legions of crustie
tekno travellers like SP23 looking to escape the '94 Criminal Justice
Act and redefine noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept away by the first
wave of The Hague electronics and the early works of I-F, Pametex and
Electronome when DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed from the mind
numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to dominate the airwaves at the time
and refueled a love for electro in him that had been dormant since the
mid 80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the Clone
recordshop (that was then housed in a small and dark backroom of
Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters really got out of hand. TLR started
cultivating his newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon after the original
Global Darkness crew went separate ways. He made the Bunker Records
website and started Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on the Internet. In
2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius
fame) concocted the Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the few Bunker live
acts) along to spread the dirty brown gospel. The Bunker Team was born
and he slowly rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio Italo/disco
sounds of his childhood through the mixes of I-F and sunday afternoon
tea sessions in the luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique. And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur became a reality, and
they've been touring ever since. The end of 2001 saw the birth of the
Crème Organization. What started out as a little playground for Mr
Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions with consecutive releases
of Lolita Strap, Bangkok Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization
has been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly gained a cult
following. The following years shit got a little crazy for Crème and the
Bunker Team with several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In 2005 DJ TLR will
hold residencies Madrid but also in Tokyo and Osaka, introducing
European electro talent in Japan.

Sat Jan 22                      TAG YOU'RE IT                       Toronto

On Saturday, January 22nd, 2005, Nocturnal Commissions and Glowin' 
Turtle are proud to present an old-school party to help start the new 
year off proper --

Featuring some of the finest and funnest (it's a word!) DJs and MCs in 
the NorthEast, including:

Dexyl (US) vs Sebby Bozak (UK Hard House)
Frisky vs END (Jungle)
Scoots vs Glow (Happy Hardcore)
Dirk D (US) vs Virus (Anything Goes!)
Baby Duck vs Tranzit (Euro)
Wolf vs Bliss (US) (Happy Hardcore Skratch Battle)
Apathy vs Gobstoppa (Gabber)
Tyco vs Kix (HHC w/ DnB)
Milo vs Andee Dee (US) (Happy Hardcore)
Xphox vs Dynamic (US) (Happy Hardcore)

w/ MCs: Rukkus, END, ED, Gobstoppa, ROC, and Loki

With fresh fruit, candy, and CD giveaways all night long, in true rave 
tradition!

Why the name "Tag! You're IT!" ? Partly because every set of the night 
is a tag set, which we at NC believes promotes the spontanaity (you 
can't spell it either Razz ) of real hardcore raving... but also because 
this is a Grafitti party! The FIRST Grafitti party in Toronto EVER! (It 
should be noted that we have made no attempt to confirm the truth of 
this statement. At all. Ever. ) So wear a white tshirt, bring a marker, 
and leave your PLUR book at home - at this party, we're writing on 
ravers all night! ATTENTION - THE WALL IS NOT A RAVER! IF IT DON'T MOVE, 
DON'T TAG IT! Thank you

Tickets will be available at Numb and 2 The Beat starting December 18th 
- tickets are 10$ CAD presale and 15$ CAD at the door OR if you bring a 
friend, tickets are 2 for 25$ at the door, so grab your buddy, sister, 
designated driver, heck even George Bush and save a few dollars! 
(Editors note: We charge extra for George Bush). Bars will be 
conveniently located near the venue - if you can't find one, just follow 
any MC. Wink

PLUR, ROAR, and VERYVERYDRUNK in full effect!

COLUMBUS, Ohio - A gunman charged onstage at a packed nightclub and opened 
fire on the band and crowd, killing top heavy metal guitarist "Dimebag" 
Darrell Abbott and three other people before a police officer shot him to 
death, authorities and witnesses said.


Police spokeswoman Sherry Mercurio identified three of the victims of 
Wednesday's shooting as Abbott, who played for the band Damageplan, and two 
other men, Nathan Bray and Erin Halk.

She identified the gunman as Nathan Gale, 25, of the Marysville area 
northwest of Columbus. She said there was no information on a motive or if 
he had any connection to the band.

Damageplan had just begun its first song at Alrosa Villa when the man shot 
Abbott five or six times at point-blank range, a witness said.

Abbott, 38, one of metal's top guitarists, and his brother, Damageplan 
drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott, were original members of Grammy-nominated 
thrash rock pioneers Pantera, a popular metal band in the 1990s.

COLUMBUS, Ohio - A gunman charged onstage at a packed nightclub and opened 
fire on the band and crowd, killing top heavy metal guitarist "Dimebag" 
Darrell Abbott and three other people before a police officer shot him to 
death, authorities and witnesses said.


Police spokeswoman Sherry Mercurio identified three of the victims of 
Wednesday's shooting as Abbott, who played for the band Damageplan, and two 
other men, Nathan Bray and Erin Halk.

She identified the gunman as Nathan Gale, 25, of the Marysville area 
northwest of Columbus. She said there was no information on a motive or if

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RIP Dimebag Darrell

On the subject of pwnage, recently while playing chess at the
pittsburgh chess club, one of the guys I play likes to talk about how
his piece is "owning me" and "look at this ownage."  I couldn't say
much because he's right, I was getting owned but I just thought it was
ridiculous to hear someone use such a nerdy thing while playing chess,
possibly the most ubernerd of activities.

ps to the guy who said "...wait for it.. fucking hostile" that shit
was funny as hell. that kept running through my head all day.  I
forget where I've heard someone say "Wait for it.." before but that is
quite possibly the best thing to say to lead into a very obvious
punchline to make it funnier.

some of them in there....

Subject: {pb-cle} Billy Corgan dead

At least three dead, one wounded in Chicago Coffee Shop shooting; gunman 
killed

Chicago, Illinois (AP) - A man walked onstage in a crowded coffee shop 
during a poetry reading Thursday night and opened fire, killing two people 
and wounding one other before being shot to death by police, authorities 
said.

Billy Corgan, former front man of the alternative rock band Smashing 
Pumpkins, had just begun his first poem at the Sweet Maple Cafe when the man 
opened fire, shooting the poet three times in the chest. He then turned and 
fired on a female barrista before turning the gun on himself. Police were on 
the scene within minutes.

"It was pandemonium," Sgt. Keenan of the Chicago Police said. "It's usually 
pretty quiet in there."

Eyewitnesses were shocked. William Carlson, 24, saw it all happen. "It was 
horrible, just horrible," he said between sobs. "All Billy wanted to do was 
read his poetry. Who would do something like this?"

The incident is eerily reminiscent of a shooting in a Columbus nightclub 
that resulted in the death of "Dimebag" Darrel Abbott Wednesday night.

truly sad news

its not just "somebody", i can think of a pretty large number that 
ive been rooting for something really horrible to happen to. 
racist white people should be the first to go though, and theres

Subject: {pb-cle} Billy Corgan dead

At least three dead, one wounded in Chicago Coffee Shop shooting; gunman 
killed

Chicago, Illinois (AP) - A man walked onstage in a crowded coffee shop 
during a poetry reading Thursday night and opened fire, killing two people 
and wounding one other before being shot to death by police, authorities 
said.

Billy Corgan, former front man of the alternative rock band Smashing 
Pumpkins, had just begun his first poem at the Sweet Maple Cafe when the man

opened fire, shooting the poet three times in the chest. He then turned and 
fired on a female barrista before turning the gun on himself. Police were on

the scene within minutes.

"It was pandemonium," Sgt. Keenan of the Chicago Police said. "It's usually 
pretty quiet in there."

Eyewitnesses were shocked. William Carlson, 24, saw it all happen. "It was 
horrible, just horrible," he said between sobs. "All Billy wanted to do was 
read his poetry. Who would do something like this?"

The incident is eerily reminiscent of a shooting in a Columbus nightclub 
that resulted in the death of "Dimebag" Darrel Abbott Wednesday night.

truly sad news

nothing at all? if it wasnt an issue, i wouldnt talk about it. in

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Billy Corgan dead

For real.  I remember reading an interview with Billy Corgan before
that mellon-collie nonsense came out and he said that if mellon-collie
wasn't successful they would pack it in and break up as a band.  That
double album was a pretty large disappointment, but since I was
discovering a lot of other music at the time, it didn't bother me so
much.  But based on the general quality of that album, even though it
sold well, they should still have broken up!  The first time I heard
the "rat in a cage" song on the radio I knew that the album was going
to be a disaster.    Gish and Siamese Dream are it for me.

yeah after hearing that song and seeing him be all fashion
conscious with the bald head and goofy star t-shirt i didnt even
both buying the album. i felt very justified after i first heard
it, definitely one of the biggest disappointments in music coming
after the great siamese dream.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RIP Dimebag Darrell

Darrel is probably the most influential guitaist for me, as far as
playing hardcore metal.  Just wanted to comment on his death since
there was a thread on it.

I thought of ebaying his guitar pick I have from like 10 years ago
that he threw to me.  There was no ebay items for him besides his
normal signature guitar that whole morning when the news came out.  I
looked on it ebay when i got home from work and there were tons of
postings of picks and pantera memorabilia.  I imediately thought -
what a bunch of shallow fucks!  Capitalizing on the death of an
artist.  fuckers stole my idea ;)

BTW - i don't really think they were racisit.  for some reason alot of
people seem to think all bald hardcore frontmen are racist.  Pantera
is made of white people from Texas so they may very well be Racisit,
but i don't think thats what they were about.

-Ridley

nothing racist about pantera, read the lyrics (just two examples here)
also - the last time phil had a bald head was 1994

EXAMPLE #1

NO GOOD (ATTACK THE RADICAL) - (from vulger display of power)

In the states 
There's a problem with race 
Because of ignorant past burned fires 
>From evolution 
We've been killing each other 
I figure man should have it down to a science 

No chance 
Not for a minute 
Not for a second 
I won't be defensive 
I'm straight out in my opinion 
You'd better listen to a man who knows what he is saying 
I've seen your side 
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior 
Be superior 
And know your interior 

Race, pride, prejudice 
Black man, white man 
No stand 
Live in the past 
We make it last 
A hated mass 
No solution 
Mind pollution 
For revolution 

So low behold my eyes 
This land of fools will rise 
No good 
For no one 

You blame oppression and play the role of criminals 
To rape and burn show progress is minimal 
White hoods and militants you know it's such a pity 
Living, breathing 
Violence in your city 

If one man 
Had one home 
In one world 
He'd live alone without variety 
Full of anxiety 
No one to point at, question 
Or even talk to -- in his private grave 
No matter what color 
He wouldn't be saved from hell 
He dwells 
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells

Race, pride, prejudice 
Black man, white man 
No stand 
Live in the past 
We make it last 
A hated mass 
No solution 
Mind pollution 
For revolution 

So low behold my eyes 
This land of fools will rise 
No good 
For no one 


EXAMPLE #2


RISE - (from Vulger Display of Power)


    
    We've got no time to lose 
Your news is old news 
Hate this, hate me, hate this 
Right approach for the wrong 
It's time to spread the word 
Let the voice be heard 
All of us, one of us, all of us 
Dominate and take the motherfucking world 

Mass prediction, unification 
Breathing life into our lungs 
Every creed and every kind 
To give us depth for strength 

Taught when we're young to hate one another 
It's time to have a new reign of power 
Make pride universal so no one gives in 
Turn our backs on those who oppose 
Then when confronted we ask them the question 
What's wrong with their mind? 
What's wrong with your mind? 

It's time to rise 

We've lived with past mistakes 
And we've lived with our own 
Forgive, forget forgive 
Be a man, not a child 
There are to tears for peace 
Of the common sympathies 
Educate, reinstate, educate 
A thing of past 
The trouble in the states 

Mass prediction, unification 
Breathing life into our lungs 
Every creed and every kind 
To give us depth for strength 

Taught when we're young to hate one another 
It's time to have a new reign of power 
Make pride universal so no one gives in 
Turn our backs on those who oppose 
Then when confronted we ask them the question 
What's wrong with their mind? 
What's wrong with your mind? 

It's time to rise

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} more mixer noise questions

In most cases noises will come from grounding issues .... try to
separate where things are plugged in or dont plug certain grounds in
....

These strips are power conditioners .... not helpful in most cases
against common ground loops.
They are what they are designed for: condition the power and protect
against voltage changes etc.
Tough sometimes they can be helpful against ground loops but there's
other ways to go about it ... easier and cheaper too!


Here's something worthy of notice dedicated to that specific noise
elimination task:

On a related topic...

I went to Jacksonville for the Steelers game two weeks ago.  It was
cheaper to see a game there and stay on a friend's couch than to make
it back to Pittsburgh and try and find a ticket.

People in Pittsburgh, online or not, don't hold a candle to the racism
and homophobia in the south.  Was really fucked up, to say the least.

			Your probably wondering why I come on here and speak my mind.  I know, nobody cares.  You weren't wondering.  You were all just thinking to yourselves "Wow, what an asshole."  So in the end I succeeded.  Know that if you talk shit to me on here I'll react, but for fun, unless you have something to back it up.  Sure it's just e-mail right?  How soon we forget these are real poeple nonetheless.  Would you be able to talk shit to my face?  I know I wouldn't be able to about anyone.  No one. Ever.  Simply because, that's not something I do.  Sure, I can talk shit easy as fuck on the net.  Your not really there remember?  Just an invisible audience.  Couple topics to note on

Loops- Yes I use them.  Does a DJ not spin records filled with prerecorded material?  Yes he does.  Being a Live PA man and all,  I go for straight up, live as fucking possible everything.

			I meant to send a response to this to the entire list but it accidentally got sent as a personal e-mail to adam.  My apologies adam.  Anyway, yes I have heard Larry Heard.  No complaints.    Also got respect for musically driven background. Playin drums.  Playin in bands and shit.  Tunes pretty sweet man. 
http://dancemusic.about.com/od/remixersproducers/a/LarryHeardInt.htm

It's a good interview.  Learned alot about him.  How he approaches things, blah blah blah.  Very interesting.  Buuuuuuuuuuuttttt.  It's classic.  Classic means old.  Old does not mean bad.  Old means, well, old.  Guy was a fuckin genious obviously.  Know how old I was when he started his career in 86, I was 4 yrs old.  I wasn't even aware of my own existance, and the whole time, there's this guy makin this sweet ass music and starting something.  Sounds pretty cool to me.  It's just.....to bad...that......I was only.......ya'know........4 YEARS OLD!!!!!!!!!  It does honestly frustrate me.  i feel that I missed out on some really cool shit.  Cuz now it's all fucked up and everyone's kinda weird and shady.  Fuck the fact that I was born in 82.  Fuck the fact that I think me, and even Mr. Heard would love to see more and more progression in this.  I read somewhere on the sight that back in the day, this board was filled with flame wars.  Ya know what that tells me, poeple cared more back then.  Now, everyone's lost there steam, no one's fighting anymore, and, well, the outlook is dim.  Right?  No.  Not at all.  And to really sum it all up, 

i saw a comment awhile back about how electronic music was 90's music

Yeah...


Think so...??

Then I guess metal is late 70's music.  Or jazz is 30's music.  I don't even fuckin know.  When it comes down to it....music is fuckin music.  Just so happens, that I love electronic music (especially when it....wait for it....progresses).  Of every different flavor.  It's like candy.  Or a nice cup of folger's in the morning.

really, if youre going to spoof emails from my address youd think
it wouldnt be too hard to make sure my name appears in the inbox
as "Thomas D. Cox, Jr." instead of my email which obviously isnt
how my mails appear. nice try though. 

thanks

I'm confused, is there a glitch in the matrix or is it too early?

Having a conversation with yourself again?

That's pathetic!

Subject: {pb-cle} noise quieting - not of the "mixer" variety

ok. so some of you may know that i do live pa/dj'ing with my computer.

well, i gots me a nifty little LCD monitor recently, and when it's in VGA mode (1024x768 @ 60-75 hz
or mhz), it causes a whining, squeaky feedback noise in my signal chain.

i've tried isolating the monitor to another circuit, but it doesn't usually work.

is there any sort of affordable noise cancelling hardware out there that i should check into?

thanks!

m

ok. so some of you may know that i do live pa/dj'ing with my computer.

well, i gots me a nifty little LCD monitor recently, and when it's in VGA mode (1024x768 @ 60-75 hz
or mhz), it causes a whining, squeaky feedback noise in my signal chain.

i've tried isolating the monitor to another circuit, but it doesn't usually work.

is there any sort of affordable noise cancelling hardware out there that i should check into?

thanks!

			Actually dude, mess around with your soundcard software.  I know the problem occurs after changing your resolution, but you never know.  Computers are not a perfect science by any means, and sometimes you just get really weird glitches that don't make any sense.  Try messin with the mixer that came with your soundcard.  If you have an empty mic input or anything, try muting it.  Ya never know really.  Also, more details on how your shit is chained might bring light to the problem for someone else to help you out a little better.

Yeah, I've read things that suggest these types of things as fixes for weird
sound problems and I'll add one I remember - unplug the audio cable that
goes from your CD-ROM to your sound card.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  So far all but one person
thinks this is a good idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

this is the official "REDEMPTION" thread...i will update it in the 
coming weeks. expect to see flyers by Halloween. i should be droppin' 
flyers at Monster Mash 3, so grab one from me there.

the venue is a beautiful club that features lounge areas, 2 full bars, 
quality visuals by VAST and sound by Thundersound. there is also plenty 
of free parking available in the lots directly in front of the venue. 
this is a virgin venue for us, so lets please respect the real estate 
and preserve our ability to continue throwing events here.

also look out for "UNBROKEN CHAIN" - 1/29/05 in SW Ohio. info on that 
show will be public in about a week or so.

RIZUMU @ THE METRO LOUNGE
SATURDAY DECEMBER 18th 2004

SCAN 7 : DETROIT, MICHIGAN
www.scan7.com : www.tresorberlin.de : www.undergroundresistance.com

In their first ever Philadelphia exhibition, Scan 7 is coming straight
out of Detroit with a hardware based "Live PA" and their own hypnotic
visuals. Remaining hidden behind their ninja-like appearances, these
anonymous heroes will provide a safe passage out of the sound slavery
of corporate programming.

The true identity of Scan 7 remains a mystery.  Always performing
masked -- a proof of their link with Detroit's powerhouse Underground
Resistance -- they believe it's important not who you see but what you
hear.  Their dark and funky dance floor music and incredible
imaginations have brought them to the most credible underground labels
in the world: Tresor, UR, SID, FCOM, Elypsia, and their own label,
Cratesavers.

ring in the New Year proper.  This event will surely be a memorable 
experience with way over the top decor, free party favors, a NYE 
countdown, and a massive video projection with mind blowing visual 
stimulation by Joe (Natas K) of Subsurface Tribe. This is so everyone 
can have a great time and boogie down into 2005.
 
To make all this happen, for your entertainment the cover will be ten 
dollars for a real good time.

Info:

Legowelt
    Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases most of his
music. What Music you might ask??? Well a hybrid form of slam jack The
Hague electronix combined with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic
ghetto technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more! You can't
quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell slams the pit!
    Already a few years in the business Legowelt has released a dozen or
so projects on various formats, most of them on good ol' vinyl released
on homebase Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering electronic
music label. Sometimes these tracks spin out of the obscurity like an
asteroid from a spacebelt and fly straight into the charts; such an
event happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of the year 2002
by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
    Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies the
adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic contact with the sounds
of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably
his all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley
Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers. Later on this palette of
influences grew with early Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff
from The Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked deep
music he could get his hands on.
    But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere in the early
90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit Moebius' on the radio. A punky
palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made
with machines which were found next to the garbage can. Shocked in awe
he heard that this music came out of The Hague, Holland The very same
city he lived in! Put on the right track by this fact he stumbled into
the Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of contemporary autistic
freaked music lovers who looked beyond all the bland house and dance
music that ruled the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more unknown sounds
such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco which
production secrets were closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the
first vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled Italo Chicago
combi which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as 'Stumvogel'
and 'Total Pussy Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
    Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your mind! Empty
cold pametex-style electro from the nordic territories, a sinister film
noir movie soundtrack, chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
    Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of the staccato
minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected melodies and haunting tensions
in between beats. Orgue Electronique is not only known for the releases
he did on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That Never
Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album) and various
compilations, but also for his collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker
Records. Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage, who did releases
on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared on the DJ Hell mix CD on React.
Besides all this, Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to Detroit, from Tokyo
to New York, sharing the stage with many well known artists.

Catnip
    Catnip is the mysterious international team of producers bringing
you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
    In the summer of love TLR started playing at punkparties in youth
homes that were later closed for asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded
Global Darkness and became involved in organising underground Jungle
parties in the totally freaked out and fucked up squat scene of the West
Coast of Holland area; filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and legions of crustie
tekno travellers like SP23 looking to escape the '94 Criminal Justice
Act and redefine noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept away by the first
wave of The Hague electronics and the early works of I-F, Pametex and
Electronome when DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed from the mind
numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to dominate the airwaves at the time
and refueled a love for electro in him that had been dormant since the
mid 80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the Clone
recordshop (that was then housed in a small and dark backroom of
Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters really got out of hand. TLR started
cultivating his newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon after the original
Global Darkness crew went separate ways. He made the Bunker Records
website and started Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on the Internet. In
2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius
fame) concocted the Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the few Bunker live
acts) along to spread the dirty brown gospel. The Bunker Team was born
and he slowly rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio Italo/disco
sounds of his childhood through the mixes of I-F and sunday afternoon
tea sessions in the luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique. And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur became a reality, and
they've been touring ever since. The end of 2001 saw the birth of the
Crème Organization. What started out as a little playground for Mr
Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions with consecutive releases
of Lolita Strap, Bangkok Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization
has been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly gained a cult
following. The following years shit got a little crazy for Crème and the
Bunker Team with several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In 2005 DJ TLR will
hold residencies Madrid but also in Tokyo and Osaka, introducing
European electro talent in Japan.

Sat Jan 22                      TAG YOU'RE IT                       Toronto

On Saturday, January 22nd, 2005, Nocturnal Commissions and Glowin' 
Turtle are proud to present an old-school party to help start the new 
year off proper --

Featuring some of the finest and funnest (it's a word!) DJs and MCs in 
the NorthEast, including:

Dexyl (US) vs Sebby Bozak (UK Hard House)
Frisky vs END (Jungle)
Scoots vs Glow (Happy Hardcore)
Dirk D (US) vs Virus (Anything Goes!)
Baby Duck vs Tranzit (Euro)
Wolf vs Bliss (US) (Happy Hardcore Skratch Battle)
Apathy vs Gobstoppa (Gabber)
Tyco vs Kix (HHC w/ DnB)
Milo vs Andee Dee (US) (Happy Hardcore)
Xphox vs Dynamic (US) (Happy Hardcore)

w/ MCs: Rukkus, END, ED, Gobstoppa, ROC, and Loki

With fresh fruit, candy, and CD giveaways all night long, in true rave 
tradition!

Why the name "Tag! You're IT!" ? Partly because every set of the night 
is a tag set, which we at NC believes promotes the spontanaity (you 
can't spell it either Razz ) of real hardcore raving... but also because 
this is a Grafitti party! The FIRST Grafitti party in Toronto EVER! (It 
should be noted that we have made no attempt to confirm the truth of 
this statement. At all. Ever. ) So wear a white tshirt, bring a marker, 
and leave your PLUR book at home - at this party, we're writing on 
ravers all night! ATTENTION - THE WALL IS NOT A RAVER! IF IT DON'T MOVE, 
DON'T TAG IT! Thank you

Tickets will be available at Numb and 2 The Beat starting December 18th 
- tickets are 10$ CAD presale and 15$ CAD at the door OR if you bring a 
friend, tickets are 2 for 25$ at the door, so grab your buddy, sister, 
designated driver, heck even George Bush and save a few dollars! 
(Editors note: We charge extra for George Bush). Bars will be 
conveniently located near the venue - if you can't find one, just follow 
any MC. Wink

PLUR, ROAR, and VERYVERYDRUNK in full effect!

Australia's First Busted Drug Driver Pleads Innocence

An Australian driver snared in a random drug test who tested positive for 
both
amphetamine and marijuana has denied both charges and threatened to sue cops 
for
defamation of character after he was publicly identified as the world's 
first
driver to test positive for drugs.

"I have never taken methamphetamine," the 39 year old lorry driver told the
Melbourne Age this week. "When the second test came up positive for THC
(tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient of marijuana), they told me I 
must
have consumed it within the past two hours. I had already told them 
beforehand I
had some marijuana some four weeks ago," he protested.

The case prompted an immediate response from Australian drugs education 
group
VIVAIDS and Fitzroy Legal Service who challenged the accuracy of swab tests 
and
also the wider implications of random testing.

"Anyone charged with drug driving will be identified on their driving 
records as
a drug user," Fitzroy Legal Service principal solicitor Stan Winford pointed
out, "and exposed to discrimination in employment or other fields, affecting
their livelihoods and their families."

The story is likely to have particular significance for the UK, where London
authorities launched their own campaign against drug driving last week.

"We know there are people who would not dream of drinking and driving but 
who
would happily drop a few Es or smoke a few spliffs," David MacKintosh from 
the
London Drug Policy Forum told the Standard.

"We want to alert them that drug-driving has the same penalties as drink 
driving
and impairs them in the same way," he claimed.

The drug testing issue regarding cannabis remains particularly controversial
since numerous studies have failed to prove smoking adversely affects 
driving.

Professor Jack Maclean, director of the road accident research unit at 
Adelaide
University, said in 2001 that 'while there was no doubt alcohol affected 
driving
adversely, that was not the case with marijuana'.

"It has been impossible to prove marijuana affects driving adversely," the
Professor told the Australian Driver Fatigue Conference in Sydney.

"There is no doubt marijuana affects performance but it may be it affects it 
in
a favourable way by reducing risk-taking," he suggested.

Thelma & Louise Rabbit Hunters Shoot Up Ravers

A 46 year old gamekeeper and her female assistant who terrorised partygoers 
with
shotguns at an illegal all night rave, pleaded guilty to charges of 
possessing a
firearm with intent to cause fear of violence this week, at Guildford Crown
Court, England.

Jessica Allinson and her 28 year old assistant Alexander Szyndel reportedly 
shot
out tyres of ravers' cars, blasted speakers and man-handled the party
organisers, after confronting the 600 revellers in a dawn showdown.

The woodland party had reportedly been pumping out music since midnight
prompting 'scores of complaints from neighbours as far as seven miles away', 
The
Telegraph revealed. Ms Szyndel told police they'd been hunting rabbits 
before
encountering the ravers, who she said told them to 'fuck off' when the pair
asked them to leave, prompting their excessive reactions.

Way Out West's Nick Warren, who during the mid 80s worked as a gamekeeper,
routinely carrying (and using) a shotgun, was sympathetic.

"It does upset people when a bunch of pilled up nutters invade their privacy 
and
driving cars through the woods would make any gamekeeper a little upset to 
say
the least," Nick told Skrufff. "Thankfully I finished gamekeeping long 
before
rave culture exploded, although I did tell a few townies to 'get orf my 
land',"
he admitted.

"Country people are getting a right old pounding at the moment so I must say
that most of them are fine people," Nick added. "As long as you respect them 
as
much as you wish to be respected."

Both gun-toting ladies await sentencing.

Apparently I was drunk a week or so ago and invited our whole trivia team
over for a dinner party on NYE. Someone remided me of this fact last
night. Forunately, one teammate is spending the next week and a half in
Napa Valley and has promised bring back  wine for us to drink that night.
The guy's in his sixties, has money, and claims to be quite the wine
affectionado, so I trust his selections shall be tasty. I just have to
plan a menu and prepare dinner for a bunch of people. And hopefully I
won't have to work New Year's Day.

Amanda

i want to go its a matter of i work.  prolly can see about sliding out

I will definitely have to work NYE, but there is now a good chance that 
I can get off in time to go to the Goodfellaz party.  The one they had 
last year was a lot of fun, but our hotel was not that expensive (Bond 
Place).  Maybe I booked it earlier in the year?  Hopefully we can make 
it again to Toronto.  I am just not the excited about anything else at 
the moment.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} NYE? who's going where?

You all should stop frontin' and come with us...
Product 19 and I are going to be bringing in the New
Year's in Pittsburgh this time around (I'll be getting
more details soon and yes He will also be playing
Pimps and Hoes in Cleveland afterwards). We're gonna
throw down some hardass, funky, jackin' bullshit
that'll dig right into the pit of your stomach and
make you either projectile vomit all over the place or
have spontaneous explosive diarrhea of epic
proportions - good fun!! Be sure to bring a bucket and
some rags...

Cheers!

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Interesting Ohio recount election results 

Ok, so I'm at work right now and came across this
info. Note Portage, Summit , Franklin,  Cuyahoga,
Lorain counties are the few counties where Kerry votes
were higher than Bush's. College towns seem to have
been the only thing helping Kerry in the election. At
least in my current county (Muskingum) it was not as
bad as it could have been and I'm glad to add one vote
for the Dems.

Peace,
steph

For those in Cleveland interested in the housier side
of things V-bar (below Vivo, adjacent to the arcade at
Euclid and East 4th) is doing a no-cover deal with
Doug Burkhart, Dave Bishop, Jason Soditch, Mark
Strauss, and one or two others.  Myself and a number
of folks that I know are planning on going there as
there's no cover, the bar is really nice, the music
will be good, and the cheese factor will hopefully be
minimal as not too many people know about that bar.

WISH YOU WERE HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

thankyou to everyone who came out, helped and supported this event...not 
to toot our own horn, so to speak, but i havent seen that many people get 
that worked up and excited at a pittsburgh party in a long time, there 
were moments where it was just a mad frenzy...i also have never personally 
seen the Shadow Lounge get that packed for an event...sorry about the 
little bit of drama, bedford is ok, everyone was fine, we identified the 
problem and removed it quickly, we cut out the cancer, so to speak...we 
are totally easy goin folks but if somebody wants to act hella ignorant, 
we will deal with it, as you may now know, we do it for all of you!!! all 
the DJs had slammin sets, we had a diverse crowd, old and new heads...we 
couldnt have asked for a better party...Soul Slinger said he totally had 
deja voo (i dont know how to spell that)...he said it felt like an 
oldskool new york party from back in the day...he said he recently played 
new york and it did not even come close to the underground, oldskool vibe 
that was present at Wish You Were Here...so, once again, BIG UP 2 
EVERYONE!!! keep yr eyes open for more Total Xperience events!!! THANKYOU 
SOOOO MUCH FOR YR SUPPORT!!! HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!

peace Brian

P.S. for all those suckers who dont believe in what we're doin (only one 
in particular, but i'm not gonna name names), we did it, again!!!  and 
will continue to work hard to make things happen, keep things alive!!! we 
gotz nuttn but love!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the "cancer" so to speak was 2 random thugs that rolled up in the party, 
refused to pay...ok, no serious issue...but then they stole some alcohol 
off of some people and had grabbed at a girl...they were asked to 
leave...they started gettin beligerent and and refused to leave and 
started swingin at people, so they were drug out and kicked to the 
curb...problem solved, and the party continued like it never 
happened..nobody really knew these guys and they were just there to cause 
trouble...no serious issue, but the "cancer was removed...im not sure what 
you meant when you said the cancer is best left in...i dunno...

Subject: Re: Re: Re: {pb-cle} I know you Wish You Were Here!!! it was dope!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The quote comes to mind...

"Violence, naked force, has solved more issues in history than any

worse. Breeds that forget this basic truth have always paid for it
with their lives and freedoms."

fighting sucks and should be avoided at all costs...but if somebody is 
getting beligerent with you n throwing puches, most likely they will get 
the same in return...i wouldnt even go so far as to call what happened 
violence...it was an ignorant little scurmish, it was handled and brought 
to a quick end...nobody got hurt and all involved parties parted 
ways...the party went on and it was dope...the only place that people have 
dwelled on this is here on the list...anybody that was there forgot about 
it 5 minutes after it was over...the end.

WISH YOU WERE HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

thankyou to everyone who came out, helped and supported this event...not 
to toot our own horn, so to speak, but i havent seen that many people get 
that worked up and excited at a pittsburgh party in a long time, there 
were moments where it was just a mad frenzy...i also have never personally 
seen the Shadow Lounge get that packed for an event... all 
the DJs had slammin sets, we had a diverse crowd, old and new heads from 
pittsburgh and lots from outta town...lots of kids dancing their asses 
off...we 
couldnt have asked for a better party...Soul Slinger said he totally had 
deja voo (i dont know how to spell that)...he said it felt like an 
oldskool new york party from back in the day...he said he recently played 
new york and it did not even come close to the underground, oldskool vibe 
that was present at Wish You Were Here...so, once again, BIG UP 2 
EVERYONE!!! keep yr eyes open for more Total Xperience events!!! THANKYOU 
SOOOO MUCH FOR YR SUPPORT!!! HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!

peace Brian


P.S...SUPER BIG UP 2 CARLOS SOUL SLINGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
if you were there you know, if not, get hip!

dood, i had this idea years and years ago. i think i posted it 
here in like 98. it was gonna be called "the main event" and was 
gonna feature people deejaying while other promoters and deejays 
took out their irritation with each other in the ring. i think i 
had dibs on 7up at the time. now i dont think i hate anyone 
enough....

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  So far all but one person
thinks this is a good idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Thu Dec 23                        SKRIBBLE                        Cleveland

Wish Nightclub is pleased to announce, coming back to Cleveland, DJ 
Skribble...on Thursday, December 23rd, 2004...

Selecting a house and hip hop set...

On "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000," Atlantic’s first joint release with the 
Warner Essential label, the one-and-only DJ Skribble spins pop, house, 
electronica, hip hop and progressive trance into a boombastic 
multi-artist mix which makes it perfectly clear why MTV’s own superstar 
DJ is tops both in his field and on the dance floor. Capturing all the 
vibe and vitality of a live Skribble club set, " "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000" 
"sees this master dj blending hit tracks – from an eclectic array of 
musicians such as Moby, Cher, Filter, William Orbit, the Vengaboys, 
Fragma, and even Bob Marley – with his own idiosyncratic brand of 
anything-goes mixing. "A DJ should be able to go into any kind of party 
and adapt to any kind of situation," Skribble says. "If you’re not 
versatile, you just trap yourself into a corner. I pride myself on 
trying to play many different styles of music. I can go to a hardcore 
hip hop club, play for those kids, then go to a hardcore rave and play 
the hardest trance set. What makes a great DJ is the ability to play for 
anybody."

Info:

Legowelt
    Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases most of his
music. What Music you might ask??? Well a hybrid form of slam jack The
Hague electronix combined with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic
ghetto technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more! You can't
quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell slams the pit!
    Already a few years in the business Legowelt has released a dozen or
so projects on various formats, most of them on good ol' vinyl released
on homebase Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering electronic
music label. Sometimes these tracks spin out of the obscurity like an
asteroid from a spacebelt and fly straight into the charts; such an
event happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of the year 2002
by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
    Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies the
adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic contact with the sounds
of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably
his all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley
Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers. Later on this palette of
influences grew with early Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff
from The Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked deep
music he could get his hands on.
    But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere in the early
90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit Moebius' on the radio. A punky
palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made
with machines which were found next to the garbage can. Shocked in awe
he heard that this music came out of The Hague, Holland The very same
city he lived in! Put on the right track by this fact he stumbled into
the Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of contemporary autistic
freaked music lovers who looked beyond all the bland house and dance
music that ruled the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more unknown sounds
such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco which
production secrets were closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the
first vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled Italo Chicago
combi which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as 'Stumvogel'
and 'Total Pussy Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
    Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your mind! Empty
cold pametex-style electro from the nordic territories, a sinister film
noir movie soundtrack, chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
    Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of the staccato
minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected melodies and haunting tensions
in between beats. Orgue Electronique is not only known for the releases
he did on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That Never
Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album) and various
compilations, but also for his collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker
Records. Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage, who did releases
on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared on the DJ Hell mix CD on React.
Besides all this, Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to Detroit, from Tokyo
to New York, sharing the stage with many well known artists.

Catnip
    Catnip is the mysterious international team of producers bringing
you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
    In the summer of love TLR started playing at punkparties in youth
homes that were later closed for asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded
Global Darkness and became involved in organising underground Jungle
parties in the totally freaked out and fucked up squat scene of the West
Coast of Holland area; filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and legions of crustie
tekno travellers like SP23 looking to escape the '94 Criminal Justice
Act and redefine noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept away by the first
wave of The Hague electronics and the early works of I-F, Pametex and
Electronome when DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed from the mind
numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to dominate the airwaves at the time
and refueled a love for electro in him that had been dormant since the
mid 80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the Clone
recordshop (that was then housed in a small and dark backroom of
Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters really got out of hand. TLR started
cultivating his newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon after the original
Global Darkness crew went separate ways. He made the Bunker Records
website and started Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on the Internet. In
2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius
fame) concocted the Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the few Bunker live
acts) along to spread the dirty brown gospel. The Bunker Team was born
and he slowly rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio Italo/disco
sounds of his childhood through the mixes of I-F and sunday afternoon
tea sessions in the luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique. And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur became a reality, and
they've been touring ever since. The end of 2001 saw the birth of the
Crème Organization. What started out as a little playground for Mr
Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions with consecutive releases
of Lolita Strap, Bangkok Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization
has been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly gained a cult
following. The following years shit got a little crazy for Crème and the
Bunker Team with several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In 2005 DJ TLR will
hold residencies Madrid but also in Tokyo and Osaka, introducing
European electro talent in Japan.

Sat Jan 22                      TAG YOU'RE IT                       Toronto

On Saturday, January 22nd, 2005, Nocturnal Commissions and Glowin' 
Turtle are proud to present an old-school party to help start the new 
year off proper --

Featuring some of the finest and funnest (it's a word!) DJs and MCs in 
the NorthEast, including:

Dexyl (US) vs Sebby Bozak (UK Hard House)
Frisky vs END (Jungle)
Scoots vs Glow (Happy Hardcore)
Dirk D (US) vs Virus (Anything Goes!)
Baby Duck vs Tranzit (Euro)
Wolf vs Bliss (US) (Happy Hardcore Skratch Battle)
Apathy vs Gobstoppa (Gabber)
Tyco vs Kix (HHC w/ DnB)

w/ MCs: Rukkus, END, ED, Gobstoppa, ROC, and Loki

With fresh fruit, candy, and CD giveaways all night long, in true rave 
tradition!

Why the name "Tag! You're IT!" ? Partly because every set of the night 
is a tag set, which we at NC believes promotes the spontanaity (you 
can't spell it either Razz ) of real hardcore raving... but also because 
this is a Grafitti party! The FIRST Grafitti party in Toronto EVER! (It 
should be noted that we have made no attempt to confirm the truth of 
this statement. At all. Ever. ) So wear a white tshirt, bring a marker, 
and leave your PLUR book at home - at this party, we're writing on 
ravers all night! ATTENTION - THE WALL IS NOT A RAVER! IF IT DON'T MOVE, 
DON'T TAG IT! Thank you

Tickets will be available at Numb and 2 The Beat starting December 18th 
- tickets are 10$ CAD presale and 15$ CAD at the door OR if you bring a 
friend, tickets are 2 for 25$ at the door, so grab your buddy, sister, 
designated driver, heck even George Bush and save a few dollars! 
(Editors note: We charge extra for George Bush). Bars will be 
conveniently located near the venue - if you can't find one, just follow 
any MC. Wink

PLUR, ROAR, and VERYVERYDRUNK in full effect!

Taken from Skrufff:


Villagers in the sleepy backwater town of Christinesti, Eastern Romania =
admitted they were absolutely terrified during one weekend in October, =
when thoughtless revellers staged an open-air disco without warning the =
locals.=20

The superstitious villagers reportedly mistook the rave's flashing =
lights for alien spaceships and promptly evacuated their homes fearing =
imminent attack.

"We believed we were seeing UFOs and some old legends from around here =
about clocks stopping, animals going crazy and a previous UFO landing in =
the area suddenly came to our minds," Costel Roman explained.

"We were so happy when we heard we had escaped an alien invasion," he =
added (Ananova).

Also in Romania, Constantin Mocanu, 67, made an even worse error of =
judgment when, attempting to execute a noisy bird who had just woken him =
up, chopped off his own penis by mistake.=20

"I confused it with the chicken's neck. I cut it," the Galati native =
admitted, "and then the dog rushed and ate it," he added (Romania's =
state news agency Rompres/ Reuters).

Mr Mocano's nightmarish tale echoed the equally bizarre explanation of =
33 year old Cambodian Soun Ney who cut off his penis with a butcher's =
knife earlier this year after dreaming that he was being pursued by =
ravenous demons.

"Devils, I don't have any chicken or duck for you," Mr Soun Ney said =
he'd shouted as he battled with his imaginary foes. "If you want to eat =
anything, you can eat my penis."

haha word!

yeah, my bro and his g/f came as brak's parents.  they were among my 
favorites.  two that didn't make the pics (due to my being sloshed) were 
'red shirts' from star trek original series and mulder and scully from 
the x-files - all friends from out of town, so they showed late.

anyway, i'll drop you a line for the next one.  :)

Hey now. I'm romanian, and I'll admit that theres some big fucking parties
going on in romania both now and for the past several years, but im shocked
at how dumb and secluded these people are. Some villages up there in the old
country and mountains and romania are seriously living 50 years in the past.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  So far all but one person
thinks this is a good idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Info:

Legowelt
    Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases most of his
music. What Music you might ask??? Well a hybrid form of slam jack The
Hague electronix combined with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic
ghetto technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more! You can't
quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell slams the pit!
    Already a few years in the business Legowelt has released a dozen or
so projects on various formats, most of them on good ol' vinyl released
on homebase Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering electronic
music label. Sometimes these tracks spin out of the obscurity like an
asteroid from a spacebelt and fly straight into the charts; such an
event happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of the year 2002
by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
    Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies the
adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic contact with the sounds
of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably
his all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley
Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers. Later on this palette of
influences grew with early Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff
from The Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked deep
music he could get his hands on.
    But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere in the early
90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit Moebius' on the radio. A punky
palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made
with machines which were found next to the garbage can. Shocked in awe
he heard that this music came out of The Hague, Holland The very same
city he lived in! Put on the right track by this fact he stumbled into
the Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of contemporary autistic
freaked music lovers who looked beyond all the bland house and dance
music that ruled the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more unknown sounds
such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco which
production secrets were closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the
first vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled Italo Chicago
combi which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as 'Stumvogel'
and 'Total Pussy Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
    Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your mind! Empty
cold pametex-style electro from the nordic territories, a sinister film
noir movie soundtrack, chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
    Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of the staccato
minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected melodies and haunting tensions
in between beats. Orgue Electronique is not only known for the releases
he did on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That Never
Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album) and various
compilations, but also for his collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker
Records. Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage, who did releases
on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared on the DJ Hell mix CD on React.
Besides all this, Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to Detroit, from Tokyo
to New York, sharing the stage with many well known artists.

Catnip
    Catnip is the mysterious international team of producers bringing
you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
    In the summer of love TLR started playing at punkparties in youth
homes that were later closed for asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded
Global Darkness and became involved in organising underground Jungle
parties in the totally freaked out and fucked up squat scene of the West
Coast of Holland area; filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and legions of crustie
tekno travellers like SP23 looking to escape the '94 Criminal Justice
Act and redefine noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept away by the first
wave of The Hague electronics and the early works of I-F, Pametex and
Electronome when DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed from the mind
numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to dominate the airwaves at the time
and refueled a love for electro in him that had been dormant since the
mid 80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the Clone
recordshop (that was then housed in a small and dark backroom of
Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters really got out of hand. TLR started
cultivating his newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon after the original
Global Darkness crew went separate ways. He made the Bunker Records
website and started Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on the Internet. In
2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius
fame) concocted the Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the few Bunker live
acts) along to spread the dirty brown gospel. The Bunker Team was born
and he slowly rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio Italo/disco
sounds of his childhood through the mixes of I-F and sunday afternoon
tea sessions in the luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique. And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur became a reality, and
they've been touring ever since. The end of 2001 saw the birth of the
Crème Organization. What started out as a little playground for Mr
Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions with consecutive releases
of Lolita Strap, Bangkok Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization
has been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly gained a cult
following. The following years shit got a little crazy for Crème and the
Bunker Team with several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In 2005 DJ TLR will
hold residencies Madrid but also in Tokyo and Osaka, introducing
European electro talent in Japan.

anniversary. The past year we have thrown psytrance parties at the
country's top nightclubs and have helped to bring you psytrance
artists from around the world. On January 21, 2005, please join us
for a night of psytrance in the nation's capital featuring 2 of
America's top psytrance producers and the bold nightclub decor
expected at Konvocation events.

As our thanks for all of your support, this party is free of charge.
Due to limited space and the intimate nature of our events,
attendance will be limited - arrive early to assure entry.

Performances by:

ONNOMON - LIVE!
Soular Records | PA (www.onnomon.com)
Onnomon, from Philadelphia, is rapidly emerging as one of the top
psytrance producers in the world. His recent album, No Monno was
referred to as "An utterly smashing surprise.." on psyreviews.com.
He's had releases on countless labels and recently returned from
touring in Israel. His unique style is not to be missed!

MIND WARPED - LIVE!
Soular Records | Konvocation | CT (www.mindwarpedmusic.com)
Kent Friedman, aka Mind Warped, was the first Amercian psytrance
artist to have a release on a major psytrance label. He's been at the
forefront of the psytrance scene since its infancy and has racked up
an impressive number of releases. We will also be celebrating Mind
Warped's birthday this evening. Come have some cake and wish him
happy birthday!

CYZUM - DJ set
Soular Records | Konvocation | MD (www.konvocation.com)
This year has proven to be the best yet for Konvocation's founder.
He's headlined alongside Astral Projection, John 00 Fleming, Infected
Mushroom and Hallucinogen. His debut release, due out on Soular
Records in January, is receiving global acclaim. In addition, in
December he was featured as the guest DJ on John 00 Fleming's Global
Trance Grooves, the most popular internet radio show on the di.fm /
Ministry of Sound network. On this show John 00 Fleming  said,
"Cyzum's a really really really great dj. One of the big standouts of
the year for me."

ELEKTRONKIND - DJ set
Konvocation | Digital Yeti Studios | MD (www.elektronkind.org)
Dale is one top rated psytrance djs in America. He's played at
countless underground festivals including Burning Man, Starscape,
Cubik, Playa del Fuego, and Mataa Mandaaraa. He consistently
surprises us with his energetic sets, methodical mixing and great
track selection.

Sat Jan 22                      TAG YOU'RE IT                       Toronto

On Saturday, January 22nd, 2005, Nocturnal Commissions and Glowin' 
Turtle are proud to present an old-school party to help start the new 
year off proper --

Featuring some of the finest and funnest (it's a word!) DJs and MCs in 
the NorthEast, including:

Dexyl (US) vs Sebby Bozak (UK Hard House)
Frisky vs END (Jungle)
Scoots vs Glow (Happy Hardcore)
Dirk D (US) vs Virus (Anything Goes!)
Baby Duck vs Tranzit (Euro)
Wolf vs Bliss (US) (Happy Hardcore Skratch Battle)
Apathy vs Gobstoppa (Gabber)
Tyco vs Kix (HHC w/ DnB)
Milo vs Andee Dee (US) (Happy Hardcore)
Xphox vs Dynamic (US) (Happy Hardcore)

w/ MCs: Rukkus, END, ED, Gobstoppa, ROC, and Loki

With fresh fruit, candy, and CD giveaways all night long, in true rave 
tradition!

Why the name "Tag! You're IT!" ? Partly because every set of the night 
is a tag set, which we at NC believes promotes the spontanaity (you 
can't spell it either Razz ) of real hardcore raving... but also because 
this is a Grafitti party! The FIRST Grafitti party in Toronto EVER! (It 
should be noted that we have made no attempt to confirm the truth of 
this statement. At all. Ever. ) So wear a white tshirt, bring a marker, 
and leave your PLUR book at home - at this party, we're writing on 
ravers all night! ATTENTION - THE WALL IS NOT A RAVER! IF IT DON'T MOVE, 
DON'T TAG IT! Thank you

Tickets will be available at Numb and 2 The Beat starting December 18th 
- tickets are 10$ CAD presale and 15$ CAD at the door OR if you bring a 
friend, tickets are 2 for 25$ at the door, so grab your buddy, sister, 
designated driver, heck even George Bush and save a few dollars! 
(Editors note: We charge extra for George Bush). Bars will be 
conveniently located near the venue - if you can't find one, just follow 
any MC. Wink

PLUR, ROAR, and VERYVERYDRUNK in full effect!

Hey trout, how much space do the archives take up.
Do they still exist somewere offline?

I was trying to research something last night and
was disappointed to learn that they had disappeared.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} The list archives

i think the raw mbox files take a little over 100 megs, the converted 
html files last i looked took like 1.2 gigs.  thats alot of bullshit!
the archives still exist but i haven't gotten around to setting up 
something to parse them and a place to drop them.
