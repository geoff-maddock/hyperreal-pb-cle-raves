from northwest ohio:
take st rt 23 S to 270 E, to 71 S, stay on 71 S get off at exit 108 B, 
broad st.

from northeast ohio:
take 71 S to columbus, get off at exit 108 B, broad st.

from the west:
take 70 E to 71 N, to exit 108 B, broad st.

from the east:
take 70 W to 71 N, to exit 108 B, broad st.

from broad st, go one block EAST (away from downtown), and take a RIGHT 
on PARSONS AVE (there's a KFC on the corner).  take PARSONS south for 13 
lights, then once you see a village thrift store to the left, take an 
immediate RIGHT, on REEB ave.  the space is right there, behind a department 
store.

there'll be plenty of parking, and there may be two police officers there 
to ensure the safety of the event (they're not there to frisk or harass 
anyone).

also, please drive safely...leave early, drive slow!  the last thing we 
want is another tragedy on the road.

say hi if you see me!

(i'm super stressed, so no diatribe today...altho im sure you can expect 
one soon after this ;)

Hee hee..  This keeps getting better!  I just got off a vrave session with
alot of the people who are helping out with this party and well, there is
alot of excitement going around.  Remember, this is a party by net ravers
for net ravers.  If you want to meet the people you talk to all the time,
this is the place.  At the moment I know of people coming from Chicago,
Australia, Canada and Atlanta.  We will have vrave terminals set up so we
can keep in contact with the TX Raves party that is going on the same
night.  Anyhow, this is for us and our friends.

A word of advice.  If you can, get to the area on Friday night.  Friday
night there is going to be a special Buzz (a DC rave-type club) called
Sting.  Theme of the night is West Coast style, so Doc Martin, Carlos,
Crystal Method (doing a PA), Robbie Hardkiss and Spun will be there in
addition to Scott Henry, Who, Baggadonuts, Method1, Slant, Odi, Karl K,
Javate, and Lieven.  Anyhow, between Sting, the preparty, Hypertext (the
after party) and Mosaic, this can be one hell of a weekend.  (DC and 
Baltimore are about 30 minutes apart, so if you come to one you are in 
the area for both of these parties).

Freebies and mixtapes galore.  To date I have heard from 10 DJs who will
have tapes at Mosaic.  Most are for sale, but a few are being given away
free, so be sure to bring blank tapes for trade.  NE Raves bumper stickers
will also be given away (thanks to Joe Harre).  Tara Sugar (formica on
vrave) is going to have some of her clothing goodies there so you may want
to check that out.  Alot of neat ideas are going around as for what people
are bringing to share and well, that's just too phat. 

Mail order ticket sales are now suspended, there is not enough time left
before the party for any tickets sent to be sent back.  Tickets are
available at the door or through the list of ticket sellers that I posted
before. 

For people who are travelling.  Be sure to find accomodations before you
make the scene.  I know a good number of the net raver crash spots most
people stay at are already pretty booked.  Also, we have updated the van 
faq for those of you who are travelling with more than 4 people.  It is 
included after my .signature file.

I will be posting directions to the event on Thursday to make sure
everyone has them before the weekend as well as the tentative DJ schedule. 
Also, Thursday and Friday I am taking off from work to make sure that
everything goes smoothely, so if you email me or call me, expect a quick
response. 

The weather looks okay but I will be keeping an eye on it.  Weather is 
almost impossible to predict more than 5 days in advance, but for Friday 
it looks like we may have some scattered showers in the morning, a high 
of 44 and partly cloudy conditions.  Looks like things are in an upturn 
there.

Dan

PS.  Not strictly a Mosaic note, but one of great importance to Allison
and I.  As you may know, Allison is moving up to DC from Atlanta.  She has
been up looking for a job and after fielding three offers she has taken a
position with Bloomies and is moving up here PERMANENTLY.  The Koalas are
finally together, so you may not see us up on c92 (KoalaNest) as much.  :)

Transport Rental Mini-FAQ v1.4 (04FEB96 @ 07:34:44 EST)

Compiled by Keith Flippin <DrJesus@iss.dccc.edu> and danFREELove
<freelove@access.digex.net> from information provided by Robert Alan
Rousseau <rarousse@eos.ncsu.edu> between 28 Nov and 22 Dec 1995.


What is in this FAQ?

What follows is an in depth description of a simple act. First
decide if you are over 21, have a credit card and want to create
a van trip. After that the rest is a couple hours of phone calls
and organization. This FAQ will provide you with tips and advice
on how to go do all of that.


What is the best way to transport my friends to a party?

Finding some friends to go with is the easiest thing if you don't
have something of your own to drive. Or try some form of public
transit (Buses are sometimes cheaper than trains, but always call
around for rates). Failing that, renting a vehicle is a perfectly
viable solution to the problem.


What kind of a vehicle?

Depends on how many people you've got. Under 5 people it is best to
rent a car, (2-3 - compact, 3-5 full size), 5-10 get a van, 11 and up
and you'll need multiple vans or one really big one. More than about
18 (my, you have a lot of friends) and you're better off going the
bus rental route, which is beyond the scope of this FAQ.


Who in their right mind would rent a car to me?

Well, we can't really run a referral service, but here's some tips.
Check your local Yellow Pages and call up maybe like 5-10 rental
places and ask them for what you want. For example: "Do you have a
7-passenger van for rent for the weekend of blah-blah?" Results are
likely to be best if you plan at least a week in advance. Weeks,
plural, is better, and if you're looking to rent on a holiday, forget
it unless you make a reservation *months* in advance.


Isn't this expensive?

Not as bad as you might think, but for specifics you'll have to ask
the rental agency. Usually, it should be about $40-$70 for a 7
passenger van. That rate is not bad if you have the van filed up.
You should get people commited to it like a week before you make the
reservation. And it's probably a good idea to get at least *some* of
the cash in advance - helps people stay committed, so you don't have
to worry about everybody bailing on you. It also can be helpful to
bundle the cost of the party and the cost of the trip so it is a one
cost deal. It all depends on the party. Van group rentals is only
like $10-$15 per person plus gas and other expenses. Just as an
estimate (based on 7-passenger van rented for 24 hours). *see end


What else should I ask about in advance?

Find out how long you can rent for. Remember to factor in total
travel time both ways, plus about 3 hours total for mishaps or bad
guess-work. Most places charge by time, by milage or both, so make
sure you know how far you're going and how long you expect to need
the vehicle. As with judging the time, give yourself a 100 mile
buffer on the trip milage, though finding a plan with no milage limit
is safer overall. And make sure you are allowed to drive it out of
the state if necessary - some agreements restrict this. Since
overnight jaunts are the usual, expect to pay for two days and set
the costs accordingly. 

Ask specifically if the vans have tape decks. Those are so important
on long trips. Try not to rely on a boom-box unless there is extra
space in the vehicle (e.g. 6 people in a 7 passenger van). Also ask
about air conditioning/heating or anything else that might be
important over a long trip. Try to keep it simple, though. It may be
fun to rent a Lincoln Town Car or a Miata, but you'll be sorry you
did the first time someone spills their drink.


I'm a AAA (Triple-A) member. Will that help at all?

It almost definitely will. If you have AAA membership, or any other
driving club, be sure to mention it when making those initial calls!
Most places will give a 10% discount or something, and anything off
sure helps! Some credit cards also will cover the insurance for
rental vehicles, saving another expense: check with the issuing bank
for details. Also, some auto insurance plans (for the driver's own
car) have riders that cover insurance on rentals. You will almost
certainly be very pressured to buy an insurance plans from the agency
when you rent - it's how most rental places glean a heavy profit for
insurance that will never be paid out. But make sure you have *some*
kind of insurance on the vehicle, or the trip could get really
expensive really fast if something goes wrong. And keep Murphy's law
in mind as well.


Isn't there an age limit?

Generally, yes, but it can vary from state to state and agency to
agency. Some mandate a minimum age of 25, especially for the larger
vans that hold 11-15 passengers, which is why we use the 7 passenger
model as our baseline. The smaller ones will often be rented to
drivers as young as 21, but we've seen nothing lower than that.
(Unless you have connections, in which case why are you reading
this?) Keep calling around until you get an offer that fits your age
restrictions and budget.

Also note that the age limit applies not only to the renter, but to
*all* the drivers. If you only have one person of legal renting age,
he or she is the only person who can legally drive the vehicle. On
the positive side, if you have a surplus of legal-age passengers you
*can* share the driving duties (though it may cost more; see next
answer). And note that the person organizing the van trip does not
have to be the person driving. Don't be scared of organizing just
because you can't rent.


What if we have too many people, but none are 25?

If you find that the list of people committed to going will mean
multiple vans, then pick out some people that you trust and who are
responsible. Ask them if they would be willing to "Captain" a van.
Each van should have a "Captain" or "Pilot" and a "Co-Pilot" to help
with the driving, directions, weather, navigation, music, etc. Under
NO circumstances should ANYONE drive if they are under the influence
of drugs or alcohol, or if they are impaired in ANY way. <cliche'
alert> It's not just a good idea, it's the law. Vehicle accidents are
the worst, and that's why they are called accidents. And if Mr.
Driver is tired, then s/he should DEFINITELY pull over and get a few
winks, or let someone else drive for a while. And remember, the
"Pilot" is in charge, and is responsible for everyone in that van. On
top of that, the person who signed for the vehicle(s) is legally
responsible for it/them as well.

There's usually an additional fee for having another person as an
authorized driver. Still, it is worth paying the extra so that
everything is on the up and up if they get pulled over or if there
is (I don't even want to think about it) an accident.


Any tips on scheduling?

Always give people a 2-hour 'lateness' zone. Say meet here at 1pm,
when you know you reserved the vans at 3pm. ;) This gives people time
to do those 'last minute' things they always forget to do. (ATM,
bathroom, glowstick/candy run, gas, eat yesterday's lunch, etc...)
Just make sure that *you* are on time, or anyone else who is might
get a little miffed.

Also make sure that you schedule the rental of the vans after the
meeting. Get everyone together first, *then* go get the van. If you
get the vans beforehand, you can lose 2 hours just while waiting for
people to show up.

Make sure to allow a comfort zone of an hour on top how long you
think the trip will take. Allow that there will be construction,
accidents and traffic jams along the way. Make sure people take a
whiz before they go and that there is some snack food on board to
minimize stops.


Obviously I've never done this before. What should I do to keep from
looking like a first timer?

Behave professionally. Have your driver's license, checkbook, cash,
credit card and all that at your fingertips. The agent will ask for
at least the license and credit card. When the vehicle is brought up,
review the exterior carefully and make sure to note any small
scratches, dents, or problems on the sheet they have you sign. MAKE
SURE YOU SEE IT WRITTEN ON THE SHEET BEFORE YOU SIGN. Most places are
honest, but you have to make sure or you will be held liable for
those damages. Also review the interior and make sure that any
problems are noted on the sheet.


Any more suggestions?

Here's one to take with a grain of salt. Make that a bucket of salt.
In fact, we definitely don't recommend this; it is included for the
sake of information only. Renting a U-Haul, throwing some couches in
the back and going off that way has been done. But there are dangers:
first, it is really dangerous for the passengers if they get in an
accident (which reminds me: wear your seatbelts!); second, it is
illegal in many states. Check with your friendly neighborhood 5-0
before attempting this.


*Addenda:

Jonathan Hayes <jaze@echonyc.com> reports:
A couple of things - here in NYC, van rental is a bit more expensive.
The cheapest place I could find for a 7 passenger van rental for a
trip...this summer was...$90. However, that only included 150 miles,
as opposed to the unlimited mileage of regular car rentals. In the
end, because it was about a 400 mile trip, the total rental came to a
little over $200. Still, it was a nice van.

Well folks, I have been very busy in the days after Jungle Warfare.
Even so the event is still fresh in my mind. I will skip all the usual; 
bull and get straight to the point. This party was PHAT from the space 
(Kongs, which looks like a jungle inside NORMALLY!.) to the DJ's all who 
spun excellent sets. The event was the most well attended all Jungle 
event ever in the US. We topped them all, proving that as I always said, 
Pittsburgh loves jungle. Though we had quite a few travelers from a far 
the bulk of the crowd was mostly locals and I'd say the percentage of 
people dancing to not was about 75-80 to 25-20 respectively. The only 
drawback of the night was the absolutely WACK sound guy who turned off 
the sub-woofers right BEFORE dieselBoy's set. We thought we blew the 
system BUT as it turned out this guy was afraid of "the cops comming" 
which was funny considering they were already there (hired for the 
night). Once I and Glen gave this guy the necessary verbal beatdown and 
locked him out the sound booth we turned the subs back on. Thank goodness 
the whole night wasn't bassless, still I wish I could have heard damian 
with the subs on,. Oh well, next time. Already there are rumours that 
there will be a Jungle Warfare II - The Rewind but until then checkout 
UDG Inc's next event, ProtoKulture. I will be bosting a flyer for it 
soon. While not all jungle there will be a fair amount, Ruffian, 
DieselBoy, and myself doing a live PA similar to the one I did at Jungle 
Warfare. Shouts out to SarahS (glad we got to hang out hope I didn't bore 
you!), Crisbee and Count Zero, hopefully if I can get a ride to Mosaic 
then I'll see yaz there.

By the way I neglected to mention that MC Sphinx and Dub2 did a bang up 
job on the Mics. I just wish the mics had been as clear as those in the 
jungle room at Vibration. Oh well.. Highlight of the night: The record 
which begins with "If you have a lighter in your pocket light it up.." 
Little did I know that all the way towards the back of the place people 
light up their lighters. I was up on the stage looking out and I wish I 
could have had a camera.

cybertribe-

I'm sure you've all been thinking to yourselves...hmm what should I do 
after Mosaic?   Well, there's an easy answer for this.

Come to the  Mosaic   A F T E R P A R T Y   !!!!!!

Hosted by me- Jill (unrest), Gil, and DaveG  at the famous Squash Court 
space in Baltimore. it will begin as Mosaic ends.

But this won't be like any other afterparty. As soon as you arive at the
space, you will be expected to break out your own sleeping bag or cot (we
have a few sofas, but you really need to bring your own place to be comfy)
and simply go to sleep.  We will have ambient music playing for the first
few hours.  Later in the day after we manage to get a few hours of sleep,
the music will be turned up a notch to maybe some chill dub and house
music.  As the afternoon approaches the music will be brought back up to a
dancable tempo. The event will end @ 5:30 p.m. The idea is to have a great
place to recover and still hang out with friends. 

We are also asking for $2 from all that attend so we can get brunchish
food (bagels, juice, donuts, etc) for everyone in their time of need :)
--

The one problem is that we don't have space for everyone, so in order for 
us to gauge the event, please mail me or gil telling us if you are 
planning to come. It would be cool if some of the locals come in the 
afternoon - rested- to hang out for a few more hours.

I hope this sounds appealing and those who really need the service we're 
offering will come.  
Any questions?  mail me or gil :)

welp since chris handed me these flyers & since it is in my home
town...

this saturday (unfortunately the same date as FREAK SHOW & MOSAIC)
           
February 10th, 1996

S H I N E

(no available line up on the flyer - still bugs me why chris duz this)

but judging from the last SHINE, it'll most probably be:

DJ Chris Pulse (Light + 1, Spawntaneous Productions)
DJ Gank (Spawntaneous Productions)
DJ Tik Tak (Spawntaneous Productions)
DJ Sparx (Acid Guru, Cleveland)
DJ Scorpion (Universal Vibe, Stateside Jungle)
DJ Synapse (Akron Area Artists Association)

(no available location, but it'll most probably be in the Viper Room
 of the Boiler Room again)

(no tix price, altho it'll most probably be $6 again)

Info Line: 216.651.9637.....Light +1 (which is basically chris pulse &
Jamie the Laser man aka Fly By Light)

btw...called the info line, all u hear is some annoying track..no
      line-up, no info, no nothing. if u call, leave a message &
      tell chris, doing a flyer w/o a line-up is pretty silly as
      is doing a party w/o checking if there are any other parties
      the same night.

i guess cleveland is trying to go back underground now by putting
out small flyers w/ limited info & similarly infoless voice mails,
u should see how underground they're trying to make CHERRY (call       
216.971.9038 - not only do u need an invite, but u have to read
the number off the back to reserve yur ticket, plus go to a map
point). but i think everyone knows why they're doing it so under
ground now.

btw...has anyone heard the 420 voice mail...call 216.556.0899...
my vote for kewlest party info line...i guess it helps if yur a
techno producer.

---

oh yah talked w/ jinx & said he'll be having his birthday party
at the EDGE in columbus next wednesdayÿÿ.

i think he said the lineup wuz s'posed to be something like:

DJ Boris
DJ Swan
DJ Aron
DJ Jinx & possibly Rob Rage Tag Teaming

i think the door price wuz s'posed to be $2 (just to cover the space)

---

and talked w/ carol aka girley girl productions (we all went out last
night) & she said she'll be throwing a birthday party also. some time
around april 20th. like North Coast Bomb it'll be a more hip-hop type
party w/ live mc's, circle dancers, graffers, all dat. only thing, i
think she said it wuz s'posed to be invite only w/ a capacity of 200.
i'm sure the rock steady crew, the shaolin temple, & spawntaneous
special forces crew will be in on that also.

---

ok, i'll shut up now.

Just wanted to share the weather forcast for Baltimore:

 THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...PRECIPITATION ENDING THURSDAY NIGHT...
THEN PARTLY CLOUDY AND BREEZY ON FRIDAY.  LOWS 30 TO 35.  HIGHS FRIDAY
IN THE UPPER 30S AND 40S.
 SATURDAY...PARTLY SUNNY AND SEASONAL.  LOWS IN THE 20S.  HIGHS 35 TO
45.
 SUNDAY...INCREASING CLOUDINESS WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS
DEVELOPING.  LOWS IN THE 30S.  HIGHS IN THE 40S TO LOWER 50S.

So, the weather is looking good, it's not balmy and tshirts, but it ain't
so bad.  :) For further information and long range forecasts in your area
you may want to utilize the Underground Weather Service via telnet at:

Okay, now for something that most people think I am insane for, but this
is the budget information for this party.  First, the gathering originally
had a break even point of $1600, which translates to 200 people paying. 
Right now that number is slightly higher as we have encountered problems
and enhancements along the way.  Here is the basic budget forecast for the
night: 

$900	space and main room sound system
$150	ambient room sound system
$650*	DJ Travel expenses
$50	Tickets
$75	Flyers & Mailing
$175*	Visuals & Lighting (very minimal, mainly donated)
$250*	Misc. (Candy, Water, cups, tapes for DJs, pillows, decorations, etc.)
--------
$2250	Total

* Estimated cost

Of this about 550 is already spent. This means the break even is about 282
people, which may or may not happen.  I don't mind taking a loss on the
party though, I can always write it off on taxes, but I don't think there
will be too much of a loss. :)

Now, I want to ask people what we should do if their is a profit.  Just to
make this clear, I do not personally want any profit from this, if I break
even I am happy. Their are some other place we can direct a profit (should
that miracle occur) and I want to know what everyone thinks should happen:

1. The people putting together this party have put in alot of work.  The 
DJs are going to greath lengths and some are forgoing paying gigs to make 
this happen.  Should we split the money up among them?

2. Take everyone at the party out to breakfast?

3. Send the money to the Hyperreal collective (hyperreal.com) for systems 
upgrades?

4. Put the money towards the current NE Raves site costs or purchase 
software/hardware and place it at another site?

5. Give it to a charity or political group opposed to the PEOPLE WHO ARE 
ALWAYS RIGHT!, err, sorry, Republicans (and the friendly religious right 
folks bringing their morals to a law near you)?  Okay, a charity, that 
last bit is a personal dislike of mine.

6. Something else that I didn't include here?

On a totally different topic, we do have a web page now thanks to a 
certain groovy guy.  :)  If you want to check it out here's the URL:

If you are mailing me about something please don't be surprised to have me
not respond for a long period of time.  I am really busy down here with
both work and Mosaic so if you email please take that into consideration. 
I may get it and read it, but unless I have to respond immediately I am
putting them off until Sunday or Monday to take care of.

listen dan. if there is a profit by all means you should at the very

jeesh! you are putting in so much hard work for this party...you DESERVE 
to take at least some of the profit if not all of it.

if you don't want all of the profit than you should give it to a museum 
in d.c. ya never know when the government will close down learning.
or give it to cancer research since it's the number one (disease) killer 
of humans.

me sez:             
=================================================================
February 10th, 1996

S H I N E

(no available line up on the flyer - still bugs me why chris duz this)

but judging from the last SHINE, it'll most probably be:

DJ Chris Pulse (Light + 1, Spawntaneous Productions)
DJ Gank (Spawntaneous Productions)
=========================(blah blah blah etc. etc.===============  

kevin / gank just informed me that he will not be playing @ SHINE,
he will however be throwing another party coming up...SUNSHINE...
i'll post the info on that when i get it.

and me sez:
=================================================================
oh yah talked w/ jinx & said he'll be having his birthday party
at the EDGE in columbus next wednesdayM-M-.

i think he said the lineup wuz s'posed to be something like:

DJ Boris
DJ Swan
DJ Aron
DJ Jinx & possibly Rob Rage Tag Teaming
================================================================= 

boy wuz i off on this one. jinx has informed the party will be 
on monday not wednesday. DJ Boris & DJ Swan will not playing,
they're in chicago now. spinning will be residents Dimentia &
Mephisto (sp?), Mike Fifer (Fifer/Bump/Holiday Productions -
Cleveland), Jinx (Jinxspot Productions - Cleveland), & possibly
Rob Rage (we'll hafta get jenny to convince him, kinda like 
what i had to do to get them to come out to Snow*Fall).

and me sez also:
=================================================================
and talked w/ carol aka girley girl productions (we all went out last
night) & she said she'll be throwing a birthday party also. some time
around april 20th. like North Coast Bomb it'll be a more hip-hop type
party w/ live mc's, circle dancers, graffers, all dat. only thing, i
think she said it wuz s'posed to be invite only w/ a capacity of 200.
i'm sure the rock steady crew, the shaolin temple, & spawntaneous
special forces crew will be in on that also.
=================================================================

damn i wuz off on this one too, i must've been high last night or
sumptin. the party will be on a friday, most probably july 26th
cuz carol's b-day is on the 29th (tee hee, u can rest easy now
steve & tim - oh no more competition! :O ).

Reply-To: syt@po.CWRU.Edu (Steven Y. Tsang)
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

regretfully i will not be able to do the trip from cleveland to
MOSAIC for the following reasons:

A) i still have not recieved the flyers in the mail for MOSAIC

B) i have already been promo'ing another party the same night -
   FREAK SHOW in dayton, ohio w/ john aquaviva, sleepy c, jinx,
   doughboy, & more). not only have i handed out their flyers
   in cleveland & columbus, but their flyer also appears in
   several issues of the last PLRM.

c) i have to drive one of the dj's spinning at FREAK SHOW to
   dayton - jinx - big surprise!

d) i am kinda commited to the OverLords (the producers of FREAK
   SHOW) for another reason also. they were the main investors
   of jinx's last party - Soul Generations, a party they lost
   $2000 (mostly cuz there were three partys going on the same
   night). and i feel slightly responsible cuz i wuz one of the
   people who helped out w/ that party. and i know just how bad
   it is to lose so much money on a party (just ask jenny, ed,
   rick, amy, & mike), so i'm doing my best to help them out
   w/ their next party (which is also why i flyered so much,
   brought two car loads of people, & even payed to get in for
   SNOW*FALL (eventho ed still owes me $ cough cough) in columbus.

e) i'm low on funds & haven't even payed this month's rent yet 
   (last week in columbus really cleaned me out, especially
   having to cover for jeff's ass cuz he wuz broke!)

so to all those who e'd me before & were interested in going to
MOSAIC w/ me & to all those who were expecting to meet me at 
MOSAIC, i apologize, but priorities are priorities.     

but i'm sure i'll see ya all @ ECLIPSE...

I'd personally like to see the profit (if any) go to Hyperreal or funding 
the NE-raves Majordomo account.  After all, in order for us to be in a 
cybertribe, we must maintain the electronic essentials, such as the 
Hyperreal archives, v-rave and ne-raves...

Just mah opinion...

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Submissions to: s0176326@cc.ysu.edu (preferred) or

Hey Chris, this is denise 
(remember me from Flux and pre-party at Ralph's with digicam?).  Just
wondering, I haven't been following the threads on Mosaic due to lack of
time.  Is this a thread out of the blue you started or is it an ongoing
discussion?(oh, I see all the lists on it, not outa blue...hi cybertribes,
I read this thread through Boston Raves). I think it's way-cool that
people would think of helping support Hyperreal or NE-Raves Majordomo from
a party, esp. a net party. But, there should be props beyond thanks going
out to the people who put all their energy into making something happen
(Mosaic).  One can't continue putting unending energy into something
without a return which could possibly support your life, this is what
trade and barter and the symbol of cash is all about. We all need to
survive in this world.  We can't have people bending over backwards and
killing themselves for the stuff without support in return.  That's
what is so wonderful about the cybertribe or potential for it -- the
exchange of energies beyond cash, but also including cash rewards where
appropriate. (We DO still live in a society revolving around the dollar.)

First of all, let me say that all who came to snow*fall are the best!  I
expected the worst when it got freezing cold, so much respect is due.
Also, I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who made the event
even possible (namely our space provider!).  But this is not just a
thank you note...

     When I met up with ele mental in 1992-93, I remember having the
feeling that there was a special vibe between all involved.  Now I am
part of this vibe.  For a while, nobody but a few brave souls were
trying to keep this machine we call techno rolling (most at this point
were into "alternative" music), and these souls were looked at as crazy.

     Over the past four years that I have known these guys, I have
learned an important lesson:  No matter what, keep trying.  And to me,
snow*fall is a reward for perserverance.  It took a lot of time and
energy from all of us to make it happen, I hope it was worth it.

     And if anyone ever tells you ele mental cru can't throw a party, or
that we don't know jack about techno, tell them about snow*fall, tell
them to shut up and (if applicable) tell them to suck on your d**k wit'a
piece of ice!

                             Once again, thank you!


                              Powerhouse (ele mental...while ya foolin')

Ravers should expect out of a party a good time with quality music, good
production and a place where they can express themselves freely. When we go
to a party - we want some effort and style put into it and all the details
should be taken care of by the promoter. That's their job. No excuses.

After it's all over, what the promoter does with the fruits of
her/her/their labor is entirely their business - just as it's our business
what we do at the party. Dan has been overwhelmingly fair and honorable in
every endeavour he has been involved in and he deserves the respect of
privacy. What he does with his affairs is his business. He's only charging
$8 measly bucks for this party anyway.

Stop this debate over the party proceeds...I thought this was about having
a good time. Enjoy Mosaic and if you want to funnel the profits from a
party somewhere where it's gonna do some good - I suggest you throw one.

SNOW*FALL - Ele Mental - 2/3/95 - Columbus, OH  
----------------------------------------------

THE PRE-PARTY B.S. I KNOW Y'ALL LUV TO READ...

so jeff (stuff on vrave) is driving my new car, the honda civic
(the ultimate rave mobile @ 45 mpg) that my folks had just shipped
out to me from cali. he's driving it cuz it's a stick shift & i'm
still not too keen on driving stick yet. we had just picked up my
friends brian & butch from brunswick at donutland. they're all 
crammed in the back w/ my other homeys - nick & J, from ohio city
(we were s'posed to caravan down w/ some other kids from ohio city,
but we didn't have time). we had just made a corner & had driven about
50 meters when we see red & blue lights flashing behind us - yep,
brunswick 5-0.

occifer: license & registration...   

jeff/stuff: this ain't my car, but i'll give u my license...
(i grab the papers out of the glove compartment)

piggy: so what're u kids all doing packed in a car from california?
(jeff is still trying to pull out his license which is wedged in his wallet)

me: we just picked up my friends from the donutshop, were we speeding?
(i show the cop my donut, which he seems to find a kinship with)
(meanwhile my buds are sweatin buckets cuz they had more than donuts on
 them) (jeff is still trying to yank his damn license out if his wallet)

5-0: u guys forgot to turn yur headlights on.
(finally jeff is able to extract his license to handover to the po-po)
(brunswick's best retreats to his flashing car to check our records)
(meanwhile my friends are crammed in the back praying they don't search
 us).

the nice policeman: ok here's yur stuff back, just remember to keep yur
headlights on... 

us: ok...

we count our lucky stars & one hour later we arrive in columbus @ walt's
pad. unfortunately walt is still working at the video store. so we all
chilled w/ his roomys scott & melissa. i called a few of my columbus buds,
but most of them had left for the party already. all of 'em except for 
jenny who wuz still at her place w/ mr. rage. i found it kinda ironic 
that one of columbus's major dj's didn't even know about the party. never
the less i wuz able to convince jen to convince rob to go.

after picking up walt @ the video store (and taking him back to his place
so he could change), we decided to skip mary's lil pre-party to go straight
to the party...

OMIGAWD IS HE ACTUALLY GONNA TALK ABOUT THE PARTY NOW?

are u kidding, i've got a few more bones to pick...

1st off lemme say, greta & troutsoup, i can't believe u guys didn't
have to pay to get in. not only did i pay, but i had to pay for jeff's
ass cuz he wuz broke, this is after distributing flyers for the party
in cleveland, bringing two car loads of kids down (almost three), & ed
still owing me money too! but i figured he needed the money after his
debts from his party before Family Affair, so i paid the piper x 2.
(man i wish amy wuz workin door when i came in, she's got respects).
uhm ed i do hope u can pay me back now, hmm wuz this why u kept running
away every time i tried talking to u?

DA SPACE

definitely too small for the crowd. no dancing room what-so-ever.
spent more time just standing around than dancing due to lack of 
space (i need alot of space to dance). downstairs wuz chill w/
ambient dj's & tony's kewl visuals & video games. upstairs wuz
non-stop booty bouncing w/ plenty ole seats in the back (much
appreciated during the morning hours). didn't even know there
wuz a smart bar or a bathroom 'til much later.

DA MUSIC

TODD SINES (LIVE) - hmm a bit too minimal for me, but definitely
inspiring at times. one can not respect this man enuff for all 
that he has done. plus watching the tunes being created in front
of u adds a whole extra dimension to the music.

SHAKE - i liked his set alot & if there wuz more room i could've
danced more to it. detroit hard acid, just da way i like it! now
i know how he got his nickname, from what he duz to yur body!

HECKLE & JECKLE - welp if yur a dj, u were probably up front
checkin out their mad skillz, but if u were a dancer u were in
the back getting pissed off, wondering when these guys were
gonna get off, cuz w/ mad tricks come terrible flow. alotta
kids were bitchin in the back & leaving the floor.

KINGSIZE (LIVE) - finally got to see mr. hindman live. welp being
not a great jungle fan, i didn't appreciate it as much as say all
the nutters from canada (i couldn't believe there were canooks @
the party). but gotta give stephen props he has really progressed
since his Big Engine daze (that would be Unique Magazine daze for
me).

GAGA (LIVE) - finally got to see ed & his band perform. i've heard
stories & wuz still a little surprised. definitely an experience.
kinda like the members of einsturzende neubauten & monty phython
got together had a mad orgy, forgot to wear their condoms & gave
birth to GAGA. ed in white tights, tripping over the drums, blowing
bubbles is a sight to behold. the highlight of the act was definitely
the flaming drum set - beavis would've been in 7th heaven! btw who
wuz the strange dude who danced through out the set, i hope u guys
fed him enuff peanuts. he certainly deserved it being the only one
bold enuff to dance so hard like that thru a mostly ambient live
act. one spectator at the end shouted: how  retarded! to which i
could only retort: well it takes skillz to be that retarded!

PLA-DOUGH (PLACEBO & DOUGHBOY) - ahh my vote for set of the night.
trax u can dance to & flow. gimme placebo & doughboy behind the
tables, spinnin beats u can bounce to & a cleared out floor & i'll
be happy!

SOME DUDE THAT LOOKED LIKE SCOTT HENRY - dis kat, i swear to gawd,
wuz the spittin image of scott henry, except shorter, he even spun
trax like him. he wuz the last dj to spin before we left. i asked
doughboy his name, but of course doug had no clue. well whoever he
wuz he wuz spinnin some mad trax! too bad i wuz too dead to throw
down at the time tho.

DA PEOPLE

netters galore in da howse: obviously the ele mentals:
ed, charles, titonton, todd, tony, doug, stephen. other netters i
bumped into: jamie/troutsoup, greta/sugarbear (we even danced a 
little - she actually brought it outta me), JJ (who i bought a 
Terry Mullan tape off of), devon, elaine (told her about the cat
for russ), michael (who spent more time w/ his new girley than
anybody else). some girl gave me this amazing back massage with
this electronic massager she had. it turned out she wuz from 
pittsburgh & i had met her before & forgot - she wuz the ? girl
in the pic of the pittsburgh crew w/ joe187 & stickman rick. speakin
of met before & forgot - didn't recognize dawn 'til she danced in
front of me (ever realize how u recognize people by the way they
dance?) cuz she's got blond hair now. speakin o dancing, missed 
seeing leidra cuz she took a bus to Burn in NY. but shannon wuz 
there. talked a little w/ amy/siren about all the shit talk & cliques
in columbus. hmm don't i know it. met the lady whose doing that
techno ballet in columbus. she wuz pretty kewl & she gave me two
free passes. i'll hafta post about that later. and oh yeah, bumped
into CZ5's mama, she said i could waste as much bandwidth as i wanted
as long as i gave her props in my review (tee hee :P ).

AFTER DA PARTY

afterwards nick picked up a girl & shawn also rode back with us.
the nine of us went to shoney's for the all u can eat breakfast bar.
there actually wuz a true hic there (as opposed to the hoax hic that
i wuz) with a cowboy hat & everything. he liked my hat. after stuffing
ourselves we all went to walt's pad where we played w/ his sony 3di 
video game 'til we passed out.  the following day at the request of nick's
new girlfriend, we all watched the movie FRIDAYS - my new recommendation
for movie to rent. ice cube's friend totally reminded me of my friend
jinx! we had to get going after that, but promised to return for walt's
party - SUPERFLY!

anything else i'm forgetting...oh yeah no bowel movements at snow*fall,
shivastar!

well steven's detailed review led me to want to say a couple more things 
about the party.  some of this should probably be private but since 
steven's post wasn't, mine isn't either.

even more ironic is the fact that rob rage was supposed to be doing the 
afterhours, he was on the flyer, and i had told him about it many times.  
so there...take that at face value.

steven, this is wack and "u" know it.  you're making me out to be a 
thief.  ok, yes you did distribute flyers for me and bring some people.  
for that i thank you.  but this debt i have with you is NOT THE BUSINESS 
of this list.  and if anyone really wants to know, i owe steven _$10_ for 
an ad in PLRM that i had to fax him _twice_ and looks _very_ poor in the 
final magazine.  

but above and beyond this, steve, you and many other people (either on 
this list or in the scene in general) came to several FREE parties over 
the last 6 months.  in fact we threw about _6_ free parties, and 
doughboy's speakers were ruined.  who is paying to get them fixed?  we 
are.  you're going to jump down my throat for asking people to pay a 
measly _$8_ for a phat party, the first one we've even charged for in 6 
months????  we thought it was entirely reasonable to ask people to do 
this.  in fact, your/their $8, and any profits we've made, are basically 
paying for 6 months worth of parties!  yah, we're GOUGING THE SCENE 
alright.  sheesh, columbus should be called "little chicago" if that's 
the case.  steve, please keep this shit private next time.

ok, enough negativity...snow*fall was too wonderful for me to complain!  
i refuse to be brought down.  but i did want to clarify some other minor 
things steven mentions....

what??  i saw PLENTY of people dancing...i should say, tho, that that's 
part of what the event was all about: detroit.  in detroit the kids go 
CRAZY over mad tricks, and if you can't dance to it then that means you 
just aren't used to that kind of approach.  this was an education of sorts...

ha ha!  glad someone appreciated it...

> one spectator at the end shouted: how  retarded! to which i
> could only retort: well it takes skillz to be that retarded!

geez, this is just the kind of close-mindedness i want to literally 
EXPUNGE from the scene.  "oh gawd, this isn't TECHNO!  these guys SUCK!"  
what an asshole.  if you can't appreciate anything but 150 bpms pounding 
in your head all night and day, then you're an idiot.  anyone else agree?
on a lighter note, i did notice the vast majority of people who watched 
us really enjoyed it.  hell we sure love to play that crazy shit for the 
"rave" crowd...;)

his name's sparky, and he's from kentucky.  i don't really understand him 
too well but he seems good-natured...

ok, i guess that's it...

and thanks steven.  despite the negativity exchanged here on several 
points, i really do appreciate the help, the props, your attendance, and 
your detailed review.  and for your information, even a few people that 
WORKED the party paid to get in.  why?  not because i asked them to, but 
because they took it upon themselves to help us reach our budget, which 
thanks to everyone, we finally did (and then some). 

you don't know how nice it feels to be able to pay all my friends a 
hefty share of what we made, after all the times their equipment was 
used, or they spun, or they played live, or they helped clean, or 
whatever, for FREE.  we've all done a hell of a lot over the last 6 
months, and i feel that any rewards we get for that are well-deserved.  

and we'll KEEP doing free house parties, nothing's going to change that.

finally, a warm thanks to evryone who came (over 500 of you!).

since you quoted me before your response am i to asume you are responding
to me in particular? if so, you are completely way off.  first, dan posted
asking everyone their opinion on the matter. if he didn't want it, he
wouldn't have asked. therefore what dan does with the money has become
everyone's concern because he made it so. personally, i just want him to
see some rewards because _he_ is the one putting $'s into it so he should
see some $'s out of it. second, in your last sentence you suggest that if
i want some profits i should throw a party. huh? i am throwing an event!
i'm the one doing the afterparty! ... and there's _no_ profit to be gained
(other than emotionally) because the $2 entry fee is going into food for
everyone who attends.

peace,
jill

ps- later today i'll post the djs and directions to hypertext, the 
afterparty/slumberparty :)

Whoa, I haven't posted on a "rave" list in ages.

So..

I do agree that there's a lot of closed-mindedness around when it comes 
to techno.  Try releasing a dance record that's not quite on the beaten 
path and see what happens.  However, at a rave, I pretty much expect to 
hear slammin' beats and crazy dance music.

I wasn't at snow*fall, but I assume there was only one dance floor 
right?  I'm pretty open minded (I think..) when it comes to music, but if 
all the dancing screeches to a halt for an experimental ambient set, I 
would probably be a bit miffed.  Not because I necessarily "hate" the 
music being played, but because I like to dance... and you just can't 
dance to ambient sets.  

Uh, well I guess you *can* dance to ambient, but.. well you know the 
point I'm trying to make.  Anyway, I know most people go to raves to 
dance (among other things), so I can understand if the crowd at snow*fall 
didn't respond very receptively to Gaga's set.  Groups are people are 
difficult.

ummm, greta and i went to the front door which was locked and not an 
entrance, we went to the back and walked in and we saw noone there that 
seemed to know about the 8$, then some girl standing there asked about a 
stamp and then laughed and snickered and then ignored us and we walked in.
read into that what you will guys, seems mostly harmless to me and btw, 
we got there after 2am if that makes a difference..??  trouty  ....

Cybertribe,

Following Mosaic, Hypertext will begin. Because space is limited we are 
asking that only people who are coming from far away crash. Locals who 
wish to come should arrive afternoon. If you plan to crash, please bring 
comfy sleeping stuff. Also, we are asking $2 from everyone so we can 
purchase bagles, coffee, etc. for the first few hours the music will be 
chill ambient moving to acid jazz to uptempo house to trance. We hope you 
will enjoy the laid back atmosphere with friends :)

here's how to get to the space...

>From the party, get back on I-95 South.  Follow signs to 695-North (in
right lane) Take 695 North to exit 20 (10 minutes) reisterstown road,
south.  (the right hand lane off the exit)

drive for about 4 or so miles until you are in the city.  there will be a
ford dealership on the right hand side of the road.  make the immediate
right turn after the ford place.  follow this street to the end and make a
left.  drive for another 50 feet and make the first left again.  this is
sunnyside ave (you can't enter it from reisterstown road cause it's
one-way) park somewhere.  the address is 4105 (there's a sign that says no
parking in driveway with an neraves sticker on it) if you pass the exon,
you've gone too far. 

ascii map follows:


695                    exit 20

Hee hee, 2 DAYS!  I will see you at the party folks.

>From West of Baltimore (Pittsburgh, Cleveland, California (take a plane)):

Take the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the 70
Take the 70 to Baltimore Beltway 695

Take the 95 North
See directions "From South of Baltimore" 

>From North of Baltimore (Philly, N. Delaware, NY, Boston, NJ):

Take the I-95 South into Baltimore and through the Fort McHenry Tunnel.  
Exit on 50 (Caton Ave.) North (First exit on offramp)

Once on Caton Ave.:

At the first light make a left (Benson Ave., if you go too far you will 
  see a hospital to your left, if you see a Shell station on your left 
  you are going the wrong way on Caton).

I really want to thank everyone who has made this party possible.  So in
chronological order: 

Mike/Polmah, Gabe/Watson, Kevin/c0, Karen: They did Nextscape down in
Atlanta, the funnest, most loving atmosphere I had been in for a long
time.  This is the party and the crew that inspired me to get off my ass
and make Mosaic happen. 

Jason Leder/Method One:  He had to deal with me on the way back up from
Atlanta, ranting on about how the north needed an event like this.  He
helped me piece together the party plan and has provided invaluable
insight and experience to the production of this party.  Also did some
damn nice flyers. 

Lonnie:  First person I called when I needed a space, Raza Space is
exactly what fits the bill.  He made the two hardest parts of a party a
breeze, sound and site.  :)

Allison Thurman: She makes me joyful and happy to keep giving.  
Encouraged me all through this.

The DJs: Craig, Dylan, Lonnie, Mark, Jason, Scott, Cat, Ian, Will, Frank, 
Alex, Alan, Infiniti & Lovegrove.  The volunteered, most of them could 
have easily had a well paying gig that night, but they decided that 
contributing to you was more important.  Some are travelling a far 
distance, one is walking down stairs to spin, but they are all going to 
extraordinary lengths to make this happen for you.

Rob Rarousse:  The serious encouragement of taking me serious and doing a 
Van trip up from NC.  He then gave away the trade secrets and let me in 
on how to put together a van trip.

Keith Flippin:  Helped put some ideas together, and then Dr. Jesus pumped 
out the wonderful (if underutilized (you guys have no idea how easy it 
is)) Van Rental FAQ.

Derrick Miller:  SO MUCH!  First he designs and prints the tickets, then 
he pretty much does everything necessary to get the Ambient Room sound 
and all of the lighting effects.  He just did it all.

Karin Sedestrom:  SO SO MUCH!  After she hopped on board to do the 
ambient room she really took to the job.  She thought about what needed 
to get done, then she did it.  First she helped arrange the sound system, 
did the DJ stuff, planned out her room and asked for more.  She helped 
with the badges, she organized the signs, she ..  Well, she did alot.  :)

Craig D, Infiniti and Fluid:  These three are really putting alot of audio
equipment out on the line.  They are coming in early to get the setup 
going, letting alot of people work with equipment that they scrimped and 
saved to purchase and mean more to them than what they cost.  Anyhow, 
they are making sure that the sound is there for us all.

The Ticket People:  Neith, Sarah, Patrick, John, Cris, Nigel, Rafael,
Jason, Rob and Mike.  They went out of their way to make sure you could
get some flyers and have the tickets.  Give 'em a hug, they deserve it. 

But mainly this party was put on by our community, not by any single
person.  I know alot of people are saying this is my party, but this is
not my party any more than NE Raves is my list.  I am simply a member of
the community who is acting in a capacity that differs a little from some
other people.  What I do for this party may be important, but no more
important than what you do for this party.  We all make a party happen,
YOU make this party happen.  This is a gathering of our love in motion.

Dan

Ps. Apologies for whoever I may have inadvertently left out.  I am 
sitting here very tired and knowing that their are at least two other 
people I really want to thank.

Okay, the time is drawing near..  I was up at the space helping to tidy it
up and drop off some stuff.  Just being their got me terribly excited,
it's like all I can think when I look at the empty spaces is 'Right there
will be some people hugging, that entire area is going to be bathed in
people dancing, god I hope I can get some time in dancing'.  :)

Here is an idea that has been bouncing around in my head for a while.  
When you first enter the Raza space there is this cork board that you 
face.  Now, normally some notices are pinned up there, but seeing as how 
I know alot of people are looking to meet certain others without having 
the slightest idea of what they look like, just bring a picture and we 
can tack that sucker up.  Bring a photo, a little slip of paper saying 
who you are and we can post them one on top of the other.  I provide the 
tacks, you provide the info.  :)

It looks like we will be handling the liquid refreshments at the space as
no third party has been in touch to confirm.  This is good news for
everyone else as that means the water will be free (their was a 50c cap on
it before, but we got a bunch of cups and will be providing free water). 
Sodas will be cheap, but we will be recapping costs on this.  OJ will also
be served, and folks, this is the best drink for when you are dancing,
water refreshes, OJ rejuvinates. 

The most important thing that you bring to Mosaic is yourself.  The next 
most important is right attitude, just come to have alot of fun and 
contribute to the evening.  Other than that, bring something to share 
with other people, that is what makes a party good, the sharing.

Dan

Ps.  I would post more, but I am tired, tired, tired.

=================================================================
steven, this is wack and "u" know it.  you're making me out to be a 
thief.  ok, yes you did distribute flyers for me and bring some people.  
for that i thank you.  but this debt i have with you is NOT THE BUSINESS 
of this list.  and if anyone really wants to know, i owe steven _$10_ for 
=================================================================

i know i wuz just upset cuz everybody & their mother owes me money.
and as a result of that i'm low on funds now & i've still got to
pay rent. u've got to admit 5 months wuz more than ample time to
cover such a small debt, but everytime i hinted at it, u would just
ignore me.

yur no thief, in fact i have the highest respect for u, ed. i'm
really happy snow*fall went off as well as it did, like i said if
anybody deserves it, it would be u & the ele mentals. y'all worked
so hard w/ very little payback (believe u me, i know how that feels).
it's good to see it finally coming together for u guys. just don't
forget the little people who've supported u the whole way thru.

==================================================================
and thanks steven.  despite the negativity exchanged here on several 
points, i really do appreciate the help, the props, your attendance, and 
your detailed review.  and for your information, even a few people that 
================================================================== 

this is what sux about being a journalist. i really did not mean to
come off to be negative, but i gotta call'em as i see'em & that's 
what i saw. they were just minor things that could be taken way too
seriously. all in all, i thought the party was a tremendous success.
it's just some people take criticism way too harshly. for example,
i just found out very recently, the reason rob wuz upset with me wuz
because i accused him of always arriving late in my reviews - real 
petty shit.  but pretty serious for rob some reason. so we had a
real long talk & now i've gained a helluva lot more respect for mr.
rage. his acquaintances may have been a lil shady, but this guy has
been spinning a long time, much longer than anybody else i know in
columbus, his roots are way deep. and i have alot of respect for
that. there's just so much shit talk going on & i sold out by 
believing in it, i never gave him the benefit of the doubt. now i
think i was wrong. basically it's that whole dj competitiveness
crap (which is part of the reason i don't dj anymore). the dj's
complain about the new skool negativity. the ironic thing is the
source of the negativity usually stems from dj elitism.

so what's the point of all this? finally after all yur hardwork,
ele mental is a force to be reckoned with. but don't let it all
get to yah. don't let it isolate yah. and don't dismiss any forces
that don't completely assimulate yur beliefs. keep an open mind
and remember with power comes responsibility. for every action 
there is an equal and opposite reaction. i prefer the positive
reaction.

i wrote this letter privately to ecto, but i think it's pretty list
related...

u sed:  
==================================================================
        Stevie, you know you rock, why would you think that this was about
you? I mean, i know sometimes we can have  bit of a rough time and our
energy is drained and we start feeling down on ourselves, i do this all the
time. One time i got email from a guy who was congratulating me on
something and i thought "oh shit, he hates me" The net is weird! So is the
mind and that so don't worry about this, just a misinterpretation. Gosh i
can't wait for the day when we can have the net, except face to face or
'less virtual' then we won't have misunderstandings :)
        take it easy & peace,
                        brad
================================================================== 

my sentiments exactly, i really think u should post something about
that especially on mw-raves. there's a few kids there that have been
taking my posts all wrong. like the post i made giving props to all 
the other people who've helped me w/ PLRM. a few took it as a show
off list to make it look like i have alot of friends, when that 
totally was not the case at all. it really irks me why people would
think such evil thoughts. i think another ironic thing is eventho
i'm pretty vocal on the net, in real life i'm actually a pretty shy
guy. i find it pretty hard to approach people that i don't know,
especially girls - usually they approach me.      

i think what it is, is cyberspace allows a generally shy
person a means to open up. and i keep alot of stuff inside of me,
so when i jump on the computer, all that stuff just explodes outta
me. another thing to point out, i don't know if yur still on both
mw & ne-raves. but ne-raves is much different than mw, in that 
everybody knows each other & it's ok to discuss non rave related 
stuff & it's ok to give props to other netters y'know, while on
mw, it's considered a sin & it's called name dropping. i really
don't understand where all this negativity comes from.

but i think  more of the ne-ravers have met each other & it's
ok to poke fun at each other on the lists, which is why they're
ready to have an all net ravers party - mosaic. i really don't
think mw is ready for anything like this yet. in fact i think 
there would be alot of segregation & cliques. i think the most
ironic thing is that was one of the positive things about PLRM, wuz
that it brought together the views of ravers from all over the
midwest & the northeast. but some kids are taking that all wrong
also, they see it only as a means of exploiting the net or a slick
way for me to make money, when in reality i lost alot of money
putting it out for free. and the only reason i kept it up was
because of a promise i had made to four girls from columbus that had
passed away. i really hate all the bad rumors that had been
started up about me because of the magazine. this is exactly why
i don't want to do it anymore.

Well it seems as if the sleep space will be packed with many tired 
ravers, so again we're asking that people who live close by please wait 
until later to come back to the space.  We'll be going untill about 5:30 
pm on sunday

Also, if you are planning to crash, please bring a sleeping bag and 
something rather comfortable and warm to sleep on. 

I'm also going to do my best to get the hot water working (hey, no one 
lives in this place) so if you want you can take a shower, but no 
promises :)  (so you might want to bring a towel or something).  Parking 
is tight, so carpool please.

Need anything else?  page me: 301.506.5253 

I just want to know who the hardcore people are, going to:
Buzz, Spike's preparty, Mosaic, Hypertext, and following dave to Mo' Wax ?

I know some people get down if people don't post stuff that's exactly related
to the list and all, but I think that that is pretty narrow-minded.  I've
been on other lists, and was bored to death after I read my fourth message
discussing the translation of a french sample on a bootleg Beastie Boys cd,
issued out of Japan from a live performance at a club in paris.  I hope you
see what I mean.  If all you do is stick to some narrow topic, it's just
intellectual inbreeding.  Lists should be about a place where you can go, and
know that at least you have one thing in common with the other people there,
and be able to discuss other things.  I got on this list because I knew that
I'd be around people who are like me, people who are part of  something
that's so much more than a group of people dancing to music.  It's a family.
 I know people get down on each other and get pissed off and everything, but
think back to the last time you were at a family gathering, tense huh?  But
the scene is so much deeper than that.  With family, you're related, and you
can't change that, in the scene, you're there because you want to be.  I've
tried to explain to people what the scene is about, but it's like sex, you
just can't describe it to people, you have to experience it.  People run
sometimes, when you start to use words like spiritual, love, and harmony,
mostly because washed up hippies overused it so much.  The first rave I went
to wasn't planned, I didn't know about the scene, and I'd barely even heard
about techno.  Years later, while I may not always be in the scene, the sense
of love, and above all else, tolerance, that comes from that sense of family,
even with people you never met, is always with me.  One nite I went to a
club, it was busted, my ride dropped me off and I was stuck, so I started
talking to a group of people and got a ride to another club.  Not everybody
can understand that, not everybody can understand when you talk about how
important "vibe" is and how you can sense it.  To the rest of the world
techno is noise, in all its forms and ravers are freeks.  I happen to think
that the most beautiful part of the day is six a.m., on a sunday morning when
you've just left, the sun is just coming up, and you, and your friends, are
the only people around, you own the city.  The scene is like the environment,
it benefits everybody in it, and is something that can be ruined, but when
treated with love and care, gives back ten-fold what you put into it.  Sorry
I ran on but it's the kind of thing i've been thinking about for a long time.
 Party safe at Mosaic, I wish I could meet everybody, but my pops is in town
this weekend and I just can't make it.

Two things have come up in the last 24 hours that I wanted to post about

I had set the lineup for the night a few days ago but was waiting for
confirmation from Scott.  Unfortunately the early morning take home set I
was hoping for conflicted with his other set, so I am reshuffling him to
the second set of the night and reworking the lineup somewhat.  Remember,
the party starts early, 9 pm, and goes to 8. 

Second, yesterday afternoon two detectives stopped by the space looking
for the residents.  No one was around so they just talked to the people
downstairs at JC Flood.  The told me that the cops were asking about a
rave with under age people (re: Baltimore Curfew Law).  Now we don't know
if this is about a past rave, our gathering or a future rave.  As we are a
a private party, with an invitation system as opposed to a broad band
flyering, the space is not public and the site is a residence so we should
not have a problem.  We will be instituting a couple of things to make
sure we are on a firm legal standing in presenting this as a private
party.  Jammin' James, our friendly neighborhood legal eagle will be in
attendance.  Anyhow, all signs point to this being unconnected to our
gathering but I felt it important to bring up.

Cybertribe,

Following Mosaic, Hypertext will begin (@ ~ 8 a.m.) and end @ 5:30 p.m.
Space will be tight - only people coming from far away should plan to
crash. Locals who wish to come should arrive afternoon. If you plan to
crash, please bring comfy sleeping stuff. Also, bring a towell if you wish
to take a shower and gil can get the hot water working ;) We are charging
$2 from everyone so we can purchase bagles, coffee, etc. for the first few
hours the music will be chill ambient moving to acid jazz to uptempo house
to trance. We hope you will enjoy the laid back atmosphere with friends :)

dj's: dave-g, jspace, gil-t (until he finds a better name:P), chris 
roland and me (if i get up my nerv!)
-----
here's how to get to the space...

->From the party, get back on I-95 South.  Follow signs to 695-North (in
right lane) Take 695 North to exit 20 (10 minutes) reisterstown road,
south.  (the right hand lane off the exit)

drive for about 4 or so miles until you are in the city.  there will be a
ford dealership on the right hand side of the road.  make the immediate
right turn after the ford place.  follow this street to the end and make a
left.  drive for another 50 feet and make the first left again.  this is
sunnyside ave (you can't enter it from reisterstown road cause it's
one-way) park somewhere.  the address is 4105 (there's a sign that says no
parking in driveway with an neraves sticker on it) if you pass the exon,
you've gone too far. 

ascii map follows:


695                    exit 20

We have a situation now.  The space is still cool, but we can expect
official harassment.  Apparently someone has been spreading a rumour about
a huge Valentines party at the the Raza space, on our date.  Due to this
we have to take some drastic actions to appease the governmental powers
and ensure that the party can go on. 

First, don't even think about bringing pot or alcohol to this party, K9
units will be in the area.  Please, just leave off the drugs.

Second, we will be asking people coming in a couple of questions to make 
sure they are here for Mosaic, not the Valentines party.  We will ask 
after email addresses or friends email addresses and where they heard 
about the party.

Third, the main concern of the police is that this is some big underage
party. Because of that, and the fact that the police may be present in the
parking lot to check things out, we will be checking IDs.  I don't like
this law, but we have to do it. 

Dan

i am sorry to say that i won't see you folx at mosaic tonight but thought 
i'd put out an idea for anyone reading to send positive en*rg to the 
party - to avoid any bad situation with the authorities - to feel a 
soulfull connectedness to fellow travelers at Mosaic...

personal needs related to work-travel and putting time and energy toward 
getting a new job are preventing me from going to this event - yes more 
than a rave -an event- a gathering that takes us to a new level in the 
evolution of our community - that is a deeply felt feeling whether i'm 
physically present or not.  there are so many of you i'd like to see 
again or meet for the first time but i'll look to the next joining....

so BIG BIG thanks to Dan for making this net-raver gathering a reality.

sending positve vibrations for hassle-free safe all-out bliss  :)

Man, you guys must be going mad crazy sooper fly slammin G on the dance
floor right about now! :)  wish i were there!

I didn't see anyone on vrave from Mosaic :(  no terminals hooked up?

Question:  since the majority of goers to this party are netters, where
mainly will all the flood of messages (reviews & stuff) go?  Which list?
All of the above?

Seems there could be call for a temporary Mosaic email list...?  :)

Easy now ... we're doing our best to try and get underage peeps in the 
place, but it is a bar, seen, so we're getting some flack from the 
owners.  This will be a new direction for the spot, so let's see how it 
goes and hopefully we'll be able to work something out soon to accomodate 
the entirety of the scene.

I sympathise with y'alls plight, but sometimes you just got to work it 
within the limits of legislation.

... and there will be plenty of people there, with some nice brown ale 
drafts to boot :-)

peaceout,
Toby

I got there at 1:00, and John Acquaviva was tearing shit up. As Stevie T 
said, that alone was worth the trip. Unfortunately I missed the first 
hour of his set. Next at three came Doughboy. I missed most of his set 
because Shane was on in the other room. Shane plays west coast 
progressive house, which I like at 11 in the morning. At a party I'm 
in the mood for hard beats, which was exactly what doughboy was playing.
But Shane is a friend and he was really nervous beforehand, and there
weren't many people in the back room, so I wanted to give him encouragement.
I eventually went back into the main room for some great hard stuff. Then
Sleepy C came on and played a set that made my night. Kept me dancing from
start to finish. 
Jesse was in the backroom at this time, and this is only the second party she's 
played, so she was also nervous so I wanted to support her but I couldn't 
take myself away from the speaker in the main room. Jesse usually plays 
'mushroom jazz', which is really, really jazzy house. Not my cup of tea. 
I didn't think the crowd would go for her and Shane much, as they play 
light, happy house and most people around here seem to like it hard. They 
both played as hard as they can, which isn't very hard. But I was 
suprised that the crowd seem to take to it pretty well. All around I 
thought this was a really cool party and I had a great time.

man i went and it was the phattest party that i have ever been to.  it 
was at this place called sportland and they had tons of video games and 
stuff there.  they had a huge dance floor, they normally run bumper cars 
on it, and a second room that was spinnin' some dope jungle and break 
beat.  i spent most of my night in the second room.

rabbit in the moon was crazy.  he did all these weird things with blow 
torches and stuff, quite a show.  along with all the phat preformances 
the vibe there was great.  you missed a great party, but i'm sure that 
another paht party will be coming up soon.

smilez and hugz

Here's a long review of Mosaic.  I will start the day of because their is 
too much to cover on what lead up to the party.

I woke up around 11 to start getting ready for the party.  Allison and 
Jason were at my place so we all scrubbed and headed out for our big 
days.  Major props to Jason here, he did all the picking up of the DJs 
that were travelling in by train or plane.

Allison and I got up to the site, did some preliminary work and then
waited for a bit.  I learned the day before that Scott was scheduled for
an early morning set so I would have to reshuffle the lineups.  After
mulling it over I could only decide on the first two sets and left the
rest to be decided later.  Having no phone available I went off to do some
errands and call to tell Scott what time his set was.  I came back around
3:30 and started getting worried as some people I had hoped to be there by
three weren't.  I had basically asked that all the people who were doing
setup be there either early that day or on Thursday/Friday.  I know that
the major crunch time is always 5 hours before the party starts and that's
where most mistakes in production are made.  So I was determined to spread
that out over a couple of days (which, of course, failed miserably) so
that as needs were identified we could respond to them while the shops
were still open. 

So I headed out to make more calls and do more errands and left Allison in
charge.  When I got back around 5 some more people had showed up and then
around 6 we were on our way to getting the ambient room set up.  Derrick
(Miller) was just a madman working out over the equipment in the back,
with Alan (Fluid) being a followup madman.  Lonnie had come in at some
point and gone upstairs to rest (he had just come back from NY). 

At some point in there, just after Derrick arrived with the sound system,
two cop cars came up and asked about the party.  I shit some bricks. 
Lonnie, however, appeared out of nowhere and just started talking. 
Lonnie is amazing in this capacity, everyone likes him, he is really a
people person (and a weather person, weather loves him).  He was
straightforward, honest and knew exactly what to say to the cops as they
played the played routine (good cop, bad cop).  Throughout the night he
was a laison with them.  Anyhow, they basically were very concerned with
this 'huge underage valentines day rave' that was rumoured to be at our
site.  They had some questions about fire department regs (there is a nut
case fireman out there who was outed from the Police Dept. because he
wasn't terribly sane and has a hardon about Lonnie, even the cops agreed
that this fireman was nuts).  But the main point was this underage 'huge
rave'. 

Up until then I wasn't feeling much stress, but that just put me in a
really bad space.  I was just, 'I will deal with situations as they arrise
and not speculate'.  I posted to the list, checked to see if I could use a
backup warehouse space (or tried to) and made some calls.  We went ahead
because it didn't seem there would be any problems if we just played it
like the cops asked.  For several hours after that the cop cars were just
sitting in the lot as we did soundchecks and finished the setups.  They 
did patrols throughout the night and their was one undercover car (ooh, 
we never noticed) up on an embankment overlooking the site until about 2.

Jason showed up with a pile 'o DJs around 6 after experiencing some
problems with my car (I finally figured out what happened, that alarm
system is screwy).  Sista Spinsta, Count Zero, Dylan Drazen and Frequency
M all kicked around for a while and ordered some pizzas as the setup 
continued at rapid pace.

Around 7 I had to run off to the main sound techs place to pick up a
connector for the ambient room.  I should have stayed, but no other person
was available to make the trip (who knew the area).  Anyhow, the stress of
that drive was the worst because I couldn't do anything while I was in
that car.  It took longer than I expected, I couldn't start my car when I
first got in it and well, it wasn't good.  Allison was with me and she did
everything she could to keep me calm, Allison is great that way (oh hell,
Allison is great, period :) ). 

At about 7:45, when I got back, Karin & Jer showed up to finish the setup
for the ambient room and info/laminates/tape table.  They did a bang up
job (I loved that ambient room).  More of the crew started to arrive and
by around 8:30 we did our final live check with all lights and sound
going.  Not a hitch, Derrick is one amazing cat.

At 9:15 things started settling down as all the work was finished.  I sat
down to eat a pizza I was splitting with Craig.  I took a nibble, got
about half way through the first slice and then looked down the stairs at
a line of people who were asking me to take their tickets.  I about
fainted.  It was just then that I felt like a real promoter.  I told
people about the situation as they came in, asked them to be cool about
the drugs and understand why we had to have a door policy then collected
tickets.  In a moment of need my pizza box became the cash drawer and
settled into that capacity all night long.  :) Never did get to eat that
pizza. 

I did that for about an hour and then Jason/Method One came over to spell
me.  I had alot of small problems to deal with as the night progressed and
tried to get everything taken care of.  I guess I left him at the table
too long (sorry about that, Jason, but thank you nonetheless).  I can't
really recall the majority of the party as I was mainly doing whatever
small jobs popped up and trying to spend a few moment with Allison when I
could.  I know that I owe some major props to people who picked up some 
slack in my production:

The Atlanta Posse: Kevin, Mike, Josh & Anthony
	You guys worked the door for hours and did a great job when you 
	weren't obligated to.  
Neith
	You actually found someone who was willing to give up a 
	substantial number of 1 dollar bills in the middle of the night, no 
	one else could have done that.
Doug-E and crew
	Absolute lifesavers.  After everyone else had left and we had to 
	face that vast expanse of litter they came in and saved the day.  
	They spent hours going over the space brushing and putting away trash.  
	I love each and every one of you.  I thank you from the sleep I 
	got to many hours early.  :)
Eric Maag
	You worked the liquids bar with Allison all night long and hardly 
	took a rest.  You were amazing.
Allison Thurman
	I really didn't expect to be doing the bar, but you were up to 
	the task.  Thank you (and I really do love you).  :)
Keith Flippin (Dr. Jesus)
	Just appeared out of the blue and worked the tape table all night long
Derrick Miller
	He did the lights, he did the ambient sound system, he took the 
	door, he did problem solving, he even gave me a massage when I needed 
	it.  He was the most important person to me throughout the night.  
 	Need I say more?
Jason/Method One
	Picked up the DJs, gave massive advice for getting this party 
	done, worked the door, did the DJ lineup signs and helped with 
	everything 
George P.
	Kept letting me know what needed to get taken care of.  That is 
	so important.
Karin & Jer (Oliver Twisted)
	Set up the tape table, set up the ambient room and set up all the
	signs.  Great preproduction. 
Lonnie
	Got the party rolling and took care of the cops, more funny 
	stories about dealing with cops have come out of this night than in my 
	entire life.
Mike
	He was the downstairs door guy who had to face an ugly situation 
	all night long.  It's not easy turning people away or enforcing an 
	unpopular policy, but he did it well and dealt with the police as they 
	came in with their 'Oh, I got you now' plays.
Alan
	Did alot of work in the ambient room, thank god.
The Ticket People
	Ack, I can't list them all again.  You know who you are and you
	have no idea how much peace of mind you gave me when you would hand 
	over the extra tickets and cash.  I can't beleive how much effort 
	each of you really put into this, thank you, thank you, thank you. 
The DJs
	Again, we all know who you are so I don't have to list.  I kept 
	hearing from the DJs, "Oh, I messed up here and here." and then I 
	would hear from people on the dancefloor, "DID YOU HEAR THAT SET?!  IT 
	WAS SO FUCKING AMAZING!" about the same DJ.
Everyone
	You guys were amazing.  I never got so much good vibe and 
	positive reaction from a rave before.  I got valentines day cards 
	(sorry everyone, but Allison is my Valentine, gave her the roses and 
	heart shaped chocolates box today), candy and hugs all night long.  
	Alot of you knew I was stressed and just gave of yourself whatever you 
	could to make me feel better.  I appreciate that.
Everyone who applauded after my short speech
	Thank god you started clapping, I had no idea when I should shut up.

Anyhow, after about 4:20 I closed up the front door ticket/cash collection
and just started to enjoy the party.  By that time most everything was
ironed out and I just let things go on autopilot.  Dylan Drazen & WILL-E's
sets were amazing, I caught the last part of Jason/Method One's set and I
have to say that it was possibly the best I have ever heard from him.

After the door closed and I did an initial count of the entry and the 
money I found that we had (somewhere, somehow) turned a profit.  I was 
hoping to break even, not really expecting to and being prepared for it.  
But I am sure we broke a profit.  I will know more later this week and 
will let everyone know what is being done with the cash.  I expect that 
if their is enough I will send out checks to the DJs and split the rest 
between NE Raves upkeep and a Hyperreal donation.

Around 8 I got really punchy from lack of sleep and started accepting
compliments.  Okay, I am a modest person, but let me explain what I meant
when I told everyone who thanked me for putting together this party.  Yes,
I organized the party.  But the sum of the efforts from the people listed
above was far greater than what I did.  I guess my production was good, I
like to think that I avoided alot of mistakes but I know I made some and
now know to avoid them next time.  I got the elements together, but I
didn't make it a great party, you did.  People came to this party with a
great attitude, and while the music and setting was good, you made it
great.  Most promoters and ravers overlook this.  They think that some
outside stimulus like the most expensive lineup in the world or the
perfect production is going to make a party great, it isn't.  What makes
the party great is getting together people who really want to make it a
special night and not just 'the next saturday night thing'.  That's what
you folks did, that's what took this party to the next level. 

We had some intermitent problems throughout the night though.  The first
problem was the heat.  I didn't want to open the windows at first as that
would let the noise out and get the cops involved.  After talking it over
with Lonnie I found that their wasn't a serious danger so we opened it all
up and things cooled off to a reasonable temperature.  We tried to turn on
the air conditioning but that left some major puddles all over the place. 
The second problem was that damned fog machine.  I didn't want to get a
fog machine at first, but I realized that we needed one if we were going
to be able to use the lasers we had available.  We figured it would be low
use, maybe a 5 second burst every 30 minutes to put enough particulate
matter in the air to make the lights effective.  Someone went over and
turned the damn thing on full blast for hours.  When George told me what
was going on I went over and turned the unit off.  Someone went over and
turned it back on.  By the time I realized it had happened again the air
was almost unbreathable.  I went over, turned it off, took out the liquid
and poured it out.  I am really sorry for that entire situation and,
justice being what it is, I think I am sick from the thing (and smoking
way too much).  The third problem was that Melon Dezign was a no show. 
Not many people noticed, in fact I didn't realize it until about 11 that
night.  I don't know what happened to Jake, last time we talked he was
still into doing it and we had agreed on terms.  I sent him all the mail
on how and when to get here, but there was no reply.  I tried the number I
had for him, but no go.  Oh well.

So all in all I think my ego is bent way out of shape with all the
compliments.  I appreciate them and am trying to learn how to be gracious
in taking them (that will take some getting used to).  I don't have any
immediate plans on doing another party like this.  I am thinking it would
be fun to get a central rural location (maybe western Pennsylvania) and
have a party to bring together the MW & NE regions net raver population
over a full weekend during the summer.  But for now I think I will stick
with just being a list admin and vrave addikt. 

Dan

PS.  Now I am upset.  I got all these new tapes and my dang car stereo 
just busted itself.  Ack!

cybertribe-

Mosaic and Hypertext were truly excellent events and even though i had 
only gotten 2 hours of sleep the whole weekend, i'm wide enough awake now 
to look back fondly with appreciation. thank you dan for your initiative 
and all those who participated in making these party fabulous!! :)

It was so cool to walk into the space and see all these nametags!! (next 
time i'll have my email addy on mine cuz more ppl seemed to recognize me 
by that than by my nickname;) thanks karin and jeremy for making them!!! :)

hmmm...i'm at such a loss for words today...oh- the dj's :
scott henry, as usual kicked my tushe, timestretch was awesome - i had 
never exxperienced jungle with a mc before. it was so energetic and 
interactive. i had a blast dancing to the set. the other djs that struck 
my fancy were frequency m- i was smiling throughout his set- and 
jason/method one. i liked how pretty and melodic the breaks/jungle was.  
unfortunately, gil and i left the space before will-e came on because we 
wanted to get an hour of sleep before everyone would arrive @ hypertext.

i want to thank dave-g, jayson and chris for spinning @ hypertext and 
dealing with my high-strungness/lack of sleep babble :P
thank you gil for being the most cutest and sweetest person :)
it was nice to break even ...

Hello all.

For those who got one of my 10 mixtapes at Mosaic, you may notice a slight
problem on the A-side:  Muffledness!  Ick!

I just discovered that the tape-deck used to dub these tapes has a faulty
erase-head, and whenever the B-side was being dubbed, the A-side would get
a little de-gaussed.  I have corrected the problem and my new freebie batch
of tapes are about to go out to those lucky peeplz!!  :)

---
If you'd like a tape from me, I'm now asking $10 for them (s&h included)
(FREE to potentially promising promoters...hey I need work!)

H.E.A.T - high energy acid techno
a parapsychopharmacotherapeutic nu-nrg mix by djkc
recorded in Houston, Texas on 1-15-96

side A - "turn me on!"
side B - "revolution!"
---

Check out the cool, full-color Jcard on my Web page:

                   http://www.nettap.com/~djkc/HEAT.html

If you'd like a tape, just email me and I'll tell ya where to send the $10,
and you tell me where I should mail the tape!    :)

peace!

Please excuse this massive cross-post...I wouldn't do it if I didn't think it
was at least half-way relevant to everyone on these lists. Please don't 
flame me, I'm overly sensitive. :)

URB Magazine is currently seeking to expand its coverage of regional clubs for
its MASSV section. Writers should be able to submit a report of no more than
500 words per month (give or take a month; we only do ten issues a year), 
hopefully be as objective as possible (ie. no blatant self-promotion, though
it is ok to mention an event you're involved with or an info line, etc.), and
(again, hopefully) be able to submit at least one photo each time to correspond with the report.

 We are also looking for writers to submit DJ profiles. These are 300-400 
words in length and can be about DJs from every genre regardless of whether
they are the biggest name or just a cool up-and-comer.

Does this sound interesting to you? If so, please submit a writing sample
(preferably a review of a recent club or event so I can see what you're into)
to me via email at trance@netcom.com or fax it to (213) 466-1207. Further
questions or need more guidelines? Mail me back or call (213) 993-0291 between
9:30-7:30p PST Tuesdays through Thursdays.

Thanks! Back to your regularly scheduled flamewars, event postings, club
reviews, and drugspeak. :)

Hey everyone.  For some reason, a number of adresses on the list have 
been bouncing a lot.  When this happens, I have no choice but to remove 
you from the list.  Obviously, the people whom I've already had to unsub 
will not read this, but for future reference, if you stop getting 
pb-cle-raves mail, your address might have had problems, and you might 
have been unsubscribed.  Just subscribe again (by sending email to 
majordomo@hyperreal.com ... 'subscribe pb-cle-raves' in the body)



Have fun..

    >a microphone and pretend you're eric from the grind...thats a sure
    >fire way to MAKE people talk to you...force them...
    
    WARNING:  Long, rambling, patronizing post follows:
    
    valiant's got a point you know.  michael raised one of the most
    interesting topics on this list for a while - at parties there are
    people who mix easily and people who don't, and it seems to me the way
    to do it is to try and not give a shit whether anyone's talking
    to you, have fun, dance, say hi to people, whatever you want to do,
    but don't start worrying, or you'll become all apologetic and unvibey.
    learn to have fun by yourself and then people will seek you out.  
    
    and if you do feel like meeting people, chatting with them, be a
    bit sensitive to the signals they are sending, if they are rushing
    about doing errands or they are having an intimate chat with one
    other person, they probably won't want to shoot the shit with you
    right now, but that doesn't mean they don't like you or anything.
    
    one other thing is about E.  "i am told", it's a sociable drug,
    and, "i imagine", it's no fun to do it by yourself, so if you're
    planning to do it, "i would have thought" you should do it with
    somebody else...
    
    i know it's one of those paradoxes, you have to be self confident
    for people to gravitate to you, on the other hand it's hard to be
    self-confident on your own when everyone seems to give you the
    bum's rush.  you have to know in your heart that you're inherently
    a nice person (which most people basically are deep down) and then
    you'll project this charisma to others and become a total babe
    magnet, erm oops i mean you'll feel more part of the family :)
    
    but all these things (except possibly the bit about E) apply to
    everyday life as well as to raves - raves aren't a magic land
    where everyone is happy just like that, they're just a REALLY
    GOOD way of having lots of fun, which tends to mean people
    there are happy and more inclined to be sociable.  shy people are
    still shy, sociable people are still sociable (and of course
    assholes are still assholes).  and as tara said, the nature of raves
    in the united states is that a lot of people travel a long way
    and so people will spend a lot of time with friends who they don't
    get to see a lot.  i don't agree that raves are inherently any
    more cliquey than any other social grouping, indeed i would say
    less so because people have fewer fixed ideas about what you
    should look like.  i mean, nice clothes make you look nice and
    that's cool, it's always good to look around and see nice looking
    people, but anyone looking round at mosaic would see that it's not
    exactly homogeneous - in fact i've seldom seen a bigger 
    bunch-o-freaks in my life, i'm happy to say.
    
    er, that's it.
    
    love, john
    who was one of those guilty of spending too much time running
    around making sure people were having fun at mosaic and not enough
    chatting to people, and so may have seemed a bit antisocial (sorry!)
    but still had a GREAT time :) THANKS EVERYBODY WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE!

    Finally I find the original post.  :)

    First, Websters definition of clique: a narrow exclusive circle or group
    of persons.  Second, my answer to whether NE Raves is a clique: No.  We
    have a narrow interests and are a group of persons, but we are not
    exclusive, anyone can join the list.  But yes, just like any other group
    of persons it takes time to really become a part of it, it's just human
    dynamics.

    PLUR isn't a miracle.  Personally, I have a really bad memory, both short 
    term and long term.  I try to follow the ideal of PLUR, but I don't think 
    it will cure my major depression or my chronically bad memory.  It may 
    not even help me overcome my general shyness.  And I am not sure that it 
    is a function of PLUR to do any of that.
    
    Let's assume for a minute that I am a person who really tries to follow my
    ideal of PLUR.  Say that I am walking down the street and there are two
    men fighting each other.  Does PLUR dictate a specific course of action? 
    No.  If I beleived in Peace, would I put myself on the line to end a fight
    and possibly be a party to the fight?  If I beleived in Respect, would I
    just give them their space?  PLUR is moot.  I would step in to give them a
    chance to break it up but not force them to stop, but that would be my
    character, not PLUR. 
    
    So what does that mean?  It means the PLUR is an ideal, not a set of
    dictated responses to a situation.  PLUR wouldn't tell me how to react
    with that situation.  But to me it means I would avoid fights personally
    and help my friends to do the same.  That I would seek to understand and
    love people despite what I dislike about them.  That I would respect other
    people decisions despite disagreeing with them.  That I would act with
    people and not against them.  I guess if you look at any action you can
    see a negative to it, but if the intent is positive then it is right
    action.

    Something that needs to be addressed is that we are a group of unique 
    personalities.  Some people are just not going to like other people.  
    When Skinner first came on the net I really didn't like his negativity, 
    but as I have gotten to know him I came to understand it a little better 
    and see the really nice person beyond it.  We are still just a social 
    group, still liable to all the ills that are human.  Some people try to 
    strive for something a little better, for some step up from the pure 
    negativity that often surrounds us, but forgive us if we try and fail 
    more than we try and succeed.  I give credit to the people who are 
    friendly for the moment and then try to get away, at least they tried.

    Looking back on the post I don't know how my tone is going to come across. 
    But I do not mean it to be inflammatory.  My demeanor may be a bit course,
    but it is not meant to be disrespectful. I just really think that while
    the people at Mosaic may have left some people feeling left out, they
    tried their hardest not to.  Everyone here is a human, to expect inhuman
    perfection in thought and action just seems unrealistic.

Today's Independent gives an interesting account of a new
study published in the Journal of Clinical Pathology.

Seven deaths were examined over the last three years, all
men between 20 and 25. Three collapsed at a rave or club,
two were found in bed, one collapsed in the street and 
one was admitted to hospital with severe jaundice.

Researchers found that all the dead men's livers showed
"dramatic changes" with dead tissue seen in all cases. 
Similar damage was found in the hearts of five of the men,
and swelling, bleeding and damaged nerves were evident
in the brains of three. Internal bleeding was found in
the lungs in two cases, and damage due to loss of blood
supply seen in the lungs of a third.

Apparently, the changes were the same as those present in
cases of deaths from heatstroke, but only two of the seven
had suffered a sharp rise in body temperature, with readings
between 39.5C and 44C.

The forensic pathologist who conducted the study, Dr. Chris
Milroy, is quoted as saying "the short term risks of ecstasy
use are becoming increasingly more apparent, and questions 
must be asked about the long-term effects on the brain, liver
and heart, considering the pathology in those who die."

consistant with heatstroke in 6 of the cases:

``The pathology of heatstroke has been reported in a number of papers.
In the liver the most striking change is centrilobular necrosis.
Sinusoidal congestion and dilatation, and portal and sinusoidal
inflammation may be present. Fatty change has been reported occasionally.
Cholestasis may be present, especially in fatal cases. Rubel and Ishak34
did not find liver necrosis as frequently as other authors. They examined
the liver in 50 military recruits who had died of heatstroke. These men
were predominantly white. Kew et a131 had found liver necrosis a common
finding in black South African gold miners. The difference in frequency
may be related to the fact that the gold miners work in very high
environmental temperatures with over 90% humidity, con-ditions not
dissimilar to some raves and discos.''

and in the other case with jaundice it was consistant with an ideosyncratic
reaction to MDMA:

``In the seventh case death was caused by fulminant liver failure and
although hyperpyrexia may have been present at some time.  In the seventh
case death was caused by fulminant liver failure and postmortem examination
revealed massive hepatic necrosis. All investigations for the cause of
liver failure were negative. The young man admitted to regular and heavy
ecstasy use, and this case is similar to cases described by Henry et al.7 
There is increasing evidence that "ecstasy" is hepatotoxic, and liver
changes have been re-ported following biopsy. 10 55
   ``These changes, however, differed from those found in the acute deaths
described above. Whether the damage is caused by an idiosyncratic reaction to
MDMA, or a contaminant of the drug is unclear. Therefore, there seems to
be a second mechanism for liver injury from ring substituted
amphetamines unrelated to hyperthermia. [...] Individual susceptibility
to ring substituted amphetamines may be related to its metabolism
in the liver. Abnormalities have been reported in demethylation in
susceptible individuals, related to human debrisoquine hydroxylase
(CYP2D6).38''

``The brain of one of the cases of rapid death showed disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), oedema and degeneration of neurones,
particularly apparent in the locus ceruleus. Two cases showed foci of
haemorrhage (fig 4). One case showed severe cerebral oedema consistent
with water intoxication and had additional occasional perivascular
haemorrhages.''

This is acute brain damage as a result of a medical crisis (perhaps
not MDMA-induced heatstroke in all cases) and not the result of
5-HT neurotoxicity.  Similarly the internal bleeding in the lungs
is another symptom of an acute crisis.

The only thing I don't know about is the myocardial damage.  They state
that it was consistant with catecholamine induced myocardial
injury, but i don't know how severe of a risk this is.  They also
state that:

``[WRT heat stroke] In the myocardium contraction band necrosis and small
foci of necrosis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate are seen. These
features are also evident in catecholamine induced injury. In the brain
ring haemorrhages and hypoxic changes have been described. The kidneys
may show acute tubular necrosis and pulmonary haemorrhage is common.''

This doesn't really say anything new about MDMA risk-assessment, though.  
It just means that in the cases of deaths due to MDMA, we may not know
exactly what is going on and it may not be as simple as "MDMA-induced
heat stroke."  Interesting from the point of view of finding out what
is going on when people die from MDMA, but not that interesting otherwise...

(Oh, I guess interesting if someone still believed that it took heat
+ dehydration to produce MDMA DIC+Co., but you convinced me that MDMA
could do this in the presence of precautions against overheating and
dehydration some time ago...)

The heart, yes that kinda concerns me, and I need to do more research to
figure out exactly what the heck they're talking about.  I don't think
that they've got a whole lot of evidence for any long-term effects on the
brain and liver, though.

Some silly-ass net-based "news" service in the UK has published a report
claiming that based on this article the kid who is drifting in and out of a
coma may have brain damage.  Really idiotic to base "possible" brain damage
on these findings when I'm certain the kid's doctors have run a CAT scan
on him (or something similar) and would know if he was having brain
hemmorages or not.

your medical library and write them a note about how you either
would really appriciate them carrying it or do really appreciate them

Pathology of deaths associated with "ecstasy" and "eve" misuse

C M Milroy, J C Clark, A R W Forrest



Abstract

Aims- To study the postmortem pathology associated with ring substituted
amphetamine (amphetamine derivatives) misuse. 
Methods- The postmortem findings in deaths associated with the ring
substituted amphetamines 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA,
ecstasy) and 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA, eve) were studied
in seven young white men aged between 20 and 2 5 years. 
Results- Striking changes were identified in the liver, which varied from
foci of individual cell necrosis to centrilobular necrosis. In one case
there was massive hepatic necrosis. Changes consistent with catecholamine
induced myocardial damage were seen in five cases. In the brain
perivascular haemorrhagic and hypoxic changes were identified in four
cases. Overall, the changes in four cases were the same as those reported
in heat stroke, although only two cases had a documented history of
hyperthermia.  Of these four cases, all had changes in their liver, three
had changes in their brains, and three in their heart. Of the other three
cases, one man died of fulminant liver failure, one of water intoxication
and one probably from a cardiac arrhythmia associated with myocardial
fibrosis. 
Conclusions- These data suggest that there is more than one mechanism of
damage in ring substituted amphetamine misuse, injury being caused by
hyperthermia in some cases, but with ring substituted amphetamines also
possibly having a toxic effect on the liver and other organs in the
absence of hyperthermia. (J Clin Pathol 1996,49(2):149-153)

Keywords:       eve, ecstasy, postmortem pathology.


Recreational use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA), more
commonly known as "ecstasy" (and a variety of other names including "XTC",
~ or "E"), is now well established. In Britain upwards of 500 000 people
are said to use the drug each week (Harris Poll (1992) for "Reportage",
BBC2, 22 Jan 1993). 

MDMA is a ring substituted amphetamine with psychoactive properties. First
synthesised in 1914 from methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), itself a drug of
misuse (known as the "love drug"), it has been used in psychotherapy and
was originally used as an appetite suppressant. The drug has ceased to be
used medicinally and is now an established part of the illegal drug scene.
It is banned in most countries. In the UK it is a class A drug as defined
in Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It has no medicinal use in
the UK and cannot be prescribed. 

As well as MDA and MDMA, another variant, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine
(MDEA, known as "eve"), which is similarly proscribed, is commonly
encountered. All have similar pharmacological effects.  In the UK, MDMA is
often taken by young people at discos and rave parties.  Both involve
dancing, but especially at the latter there is vigorous repetitive dancing
in crowded rooms with a hot and humid atmosphere. The dangers of this
activity are recognised to a certain extent as rooms to "chill out" are
often available for people to rest in after periods of exertion. Toxic
effects and the occasional death following ring substituted amphetamine
misuse have been reported but postmortem data are lacking.  1-26 In this
paper we report on deaths associated with ring substituted amphetamine
misuse and detail the postmortem findings. 


Methods

Seven deaths have been investigated by the University of Sheffield
Department of Forensic Pathology in the past three years, which were
associated with ring substituted amphetamine misuse. One case has been
reported previously.26 Case details are presented in table 1. All of the
subjects were white men, between 20 and 25 years of age. Three of the
victims collapsed at a rave or disco, two were found in bed, one in a
collapsed state and one dead, one collapsed in the street, and one was
admitted to hospital with progressive jaundice. 

Only two of the men had documented hyperthermia, with temperatures of 440C
and 39~50C. One of the deaths was thought to have been caused by water
intoxication, the victim having drunk an estimated 14 litres of water in
trying to quench the thirst that is frequently associated with ingestion
of ring substituted amphetamines. None of the men were known intravenous
drug abusers. 

Full drug screening was performed on body fluids, including a screen for
drugs of abuse. Screening by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy was also
performed. 


Results
PATHOLOGY

The pathologlcal and toxlcological data are summarised in table 1.

Liver

The liver showed dramatic changes. Necrosis was seen in all cases. In one
case there was centrilobular and midzonal necrosis (fig 1). This patient
survived for four days. In the other cases focal necrosis in zone 3 was
present, with an acute inflammatory response surrounding necrotic
hepatocytes (fig 2). Fatty change, sinusoidal dilatation and inflammation
were also identified. No other hepatic pathology was identified in these
cases. Postmortem virology was not done in these cases. In case 7 there
was massive hepatic necrosis, with the liver only weighing 795 g at
necropsy. Full viral screening was negative in this case. The livers were
of normal size in the other cases. 

Heart

Changes were seen in five of the seven hearts examined. Histologically,
the changes ranged from contraction band necrosis to individual myocyte
necrosis with a surrounding neutrophil and macrophage inflammatory
response; the same changes as have been described in catecholamine induced
myocardial injury (fig 3). In one case foci of fibrosis were identified in
the heart of a man in whom traces of MDMA and MDA were found in the urine. 


Brain

The brain of one of the cases of rapid death showed disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), oedema and degeneration of neurones,
particularly apparent in the locus ceruleus. Two cases showed foci of
haemorrhage (fig 4). One case showed severe cerebral oedema consistent
with water intoxication and had additional occasional perivascular
haemorrhages. 

Other organs

Pulmonary infarction was seen in case 5. In two of the other rapid deaths
intra-alveolar haemorrhage was present. In one case there was inhalation
of gastric contents. In the patient who died of water intoxication there
was complete necrosis of the pituitary gland. Severe cerebral oedema was
present and the pituitary necrosis was probably a direct consequence of
this as the blood supply was compromised. In two cases the kidneys were
examined for myoglobin, which was not detected. No skeletal muscle damage
was identified. 


TOXICOLOGY

The toxicological data are shown in table 1. MDMA was found in five cases,
varying from trace concentrations to 4~2 mg/l. MDEA was found in two
cases, at concentrations of 3.5 and 0~187 mg/l. Amphetamines were detected
in three cases at concentrations of 0~256, 0~453 and 1~4 mg/l.  MDA was
found in three cases, varying from trace concentrations to 8~5 mg/l. MDA
is a metabolite of MDMA and MDEA, but may also be found as a constituent
of "ecstasy" tablets, along with other pharmacological substances
including amphetamines (vide infra). No opiates or other drugs associated
with intravenous drug abuse were detected. 


Discussion

Ring substituted amphetamines (amphetamine derivatives) are taken because
they give a feeling of euphoria and benevolence and heighten the
sensations at raves and discos. However, when 29 volunteers took MDMA, as
well as pleasant symptoms, all complained of undesirable effects which
included loss of appetite, trismus and bruxism, nausea, muscle aches,
stiffness, and ataxia.27 Sweating, tachycardia and hypertension, insomnia,
and fatigue were also reported. More serious complications reported
include hyperthermia, convulsions, other cardiac arrhythmias,
rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure,
hyponatraemia, hepatoxicity, pneumomediastinum, aplastic anaemia, cerebral
infarction, cerebral haemorrhage, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. 1
26

In five of the cases reported here complications followed shortly after
ingestion. Four of these deaths seem to be linked directly to the toxic
effects of MDMA and MDEA. In the fifth case there was evidence of water
intoxication, which followed the taking of "ecstasy". In this case,
however, myocardial and liver pathology was identified which was similar
to the other cases. The sixth case collapsed in the street. Myocardial
fibrosis and foci of liver necrosis were identified and toxicology
revealed traces of MDMA. 

MDMA is believed to act on at least three neurotransmitter pathways, as
does cocaine, but with MDMA the serotoninergic (5-hydroxy-tryptamine)
pathway is principally affected, which would account for the more
pronounced effect on mood. Cocaine acts chiefly on the dopaminergic
system, which accounts for its greater addictive properties.  MDMA also
acts on the noradrenergic system. Serotonin plays a major role in
thermoregulation and interference with this mechanism is believed to be
the cause of the hyperthermia which arises as a complication of ring
substituted amphetamine misuse. Stimulation of the noradrenergic system
also probably contributes to hyperthermia. 

Hyperthermia may account for many of the changes seen in deaths from ring
substituted amphetamine misuse, although it is interesting to note that
raised temperatures were only documented in two of our cases.  The
pathology of heatstroke has been reported in a number of papers. In the
liver the most striking change is centrilobular necrosis. Sinusoidal
congestion and dilatation, and portal and sinusoidal inflammation may be
present. Fatty change has been reported occasionally. Cholestasis may be
present, especially in fatal cases. Rubel and Ishak34 did not find liver
necrosis as frequently as other authors. They examined the liver in 50
military recruits who had died of heatstroke. These men were predominantly
white. Kew et a131 had found liver necrosis a common finding in black
South African gold miners. The difference in frequency may be related to
the fact that the gold miners work in very high environmental temperatures
with over 90% humidity, conditions not dissimilar to some raves and
discos. In the myocardium contraction band necrosis and small foci of
necrosis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate are seen. These features are
also evident in catecholamine induced injury. In the brain ring
haemorrhages and hypoxic changes have been described. The kidneys may show
acute tubular necrosis and pulmonary haemorrhage is common. 

The mechanism of damage in heatstroke is postulated to be caused by
circulatory collapse and hypoxic damage, possibly combined with
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, which has been recorded in
heatstroke,3637 and as a complication of MDMA and amphetamine ingestion.37
In the myocardium the damage may be related to catecholamine induced
injury. These myocardial changes are also seen secondary to brain
pathology, and contraction band necrosis may be seen in resuscitation,
especially when catecholamines are used. Whilst these are alternative
explanations for the changes seen, not everyone was resuscitated, and the
myocardial changes are frequently seen, even in early deaths. 

The pathological changes present in these deaths are the same as those
seen in deaths from heatstroke. These changes provide further evidence
that hyperthermia can cause death following misuse of ring substituted
amphetamines. Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was also
present in the brain. These deaths may therefore be a complication of
hyperthermia, DIC and shock. Some caution must be exercised, however, in
ascribing a death from ring substituted amphetamine misuse to these
mechanisms as a high temperature is not recorded in all cases, although
hyperpyrexia may have been present at some time.  In the seventh case
death was caused by fulminant liver failure and postmortem examination
revealed massive hepatic necrosis. All investigations for the cause of
liver failure were negative. The young man admitted to regular and heavy
ecstasy use, and this case is similar to cases described by Henry et al.7
There is increasing evidence that "ecstasy" is hepatotoxic, and liver
changes have been reported following biopsy. 10 55

These changes, however, differed from those found in the acute deaths
described above. Whether the damage is caused by an idiosyncratic reaction
to MDMA, or a contaminant of the drug is unclear. Therefore, there seems
to be a second mechanism for liver injury from ring substituted
amphetamines unrelated to hyperthermia. Furthermore, the possibility that
the myocardium may also be damaged by these drugs without documented
hyperthermia is suggested by case 6 and other reports, where myocardial
fibrosis has been reported following misuse of MDMA.3 Individual
susceptibility to ring substituted amphetamines may be related to its
metabolism in the liver. Abnormalities have been reported in demethylation
in susceptible individuals, related to human debrisoquine hydroxylase
(CYP2D6).38 Another problem for the recreational drug taker is the quality
of the tablets they take. Examination of "ecstasy" tablets by one of the
authors (ARWF) has shown that the contents of the tablets vary greatly,
and may be a mixture of MDA, MDMA, MDEA, amphetamines, or no
pharmacologically active substance; compounds such as potassium chlorate
may also be found (table 2). With such material the possibility of toxic
contaminants being present is evident. 

The short term risks of "ecstasy" use are becoming increasingly more
apparent and questions must be asked about the long term effects on the
brain, liver and heart considering the pathology found in those who die.

sorry...all these forwards from ne-raves are in my box, and they are all in
a messed up order cuz my server is fukkin stooOOOpid...so sorry if they
make nooOOooo sense...i had a hard time making heads and tails of the fwds
anyways, but here is my $.02 on the whole subject (as i was able to collect
it :) ....

tranced/yeah.rite/danny SAID:

     As for recovering...it can be tough.. When you get a glimpse of the light,
>    when you actually feel yourself happy, being loved and full of love... and
>    then you come back home and you feel your energy draining and absolutely
>    nothing or no one to recharge from, you kinda get stuck..

        its funny, i dont know, maybe we just have different perspectives,
but it always seems to me that when i get back from a rave, when i return
to my "normal activities": school, job, (vrave;), my "other"
friends...being at a party and experiencing all that i experience there:
what you have termed "a glimpse of the light"---it helps me...it helps me
to be positive, to put things into perspective, and aim that energy that i
have gained at a party, from the people around my and from my inner
self...directing that at my everyday activities... sometimes i feel so good
when i get home (after sleeping about 8 hours, of course) that i want to
run to the lake and scream at the waves!!

and to tell the honest truth, there are a lot of things about my life
outside of raving that i am not happy with...we all have aspects of our
lives that depress us, that make us feel like shit, that make us unhappy.
but our positivity, the feeling that we give/receive/exchange at raves--in
my opinion, it has to come from the INsidE..we have to rechannel that
energy back into ourselves in order to help bring it into other aspects of
our lives--its not just about raves, or about our "nonrave" life--its about
trying to make ourselves into whole and complete people...that is what i
attempt to do..i try to take every experience that i have and try to make
it apply to my life...all aspects of it.

     but it's
>    much tougher when you've seen yourself happy and you've seen yourself
>    enjoying life, and you've also seen it fade away...

like i mentioned before, we all have shit that we deal with everyday, and
when we are at raves, yes it is an escape, a temporary relief...but i see
it as a progression...i have always believed that by experiencing pain and
suffering, depression..what have you, we are allowing ourselves to feel
happiness, comparatively. nobody likes to feel that way, but sometimes
(heck, a lot of the time), we experience 'bad' things...if we were always
happy, would we ever know what 'happy' really was? in other words, if we
never knew pain, we would never know happiness or beauty.

     And yes, everytime I
>    end up going to a party and come back home, I always say to myself. that's
>    the last one.. but I hunger for it... it's my only escape.. and since I
>    can't turn my entire life into a rave, I have to rely on at least one
>night
>    of bliss and joy, every other week. because it's all I have...

i dont mean to sound preachy or anything like that, i just thought that by
offering my perspective on how i look at raving, it may perhaps help
someone to think about it in light of raves as not only a separate entity,
but also how they may transgress into other aspects of our lives...and in
contrast, i also experience raves as that escape, and as a "fantasy"..and
often times just knowing that i can get away for a few hours is enough. it
just helps me by instead of letting all those hours of dancing and sheer
energy just escape when the sun rises, to take that feeling, retain some of
it, and let that positivity emit onto everything else.

*shrug* *smile*....hrrrrrmmmmmmm......thats just one TiNy way of perceiving
the whole thing....but i hope that it may bring a new/different
perspective....

sorry this one is late, but i had a calc 4 test this morning and have 
been out of my skull with classes and creative ways to not do work for 
them!  i think i got all my stuff in the file, but i have this nagging 
feeling i missed some stuff, so let me know!   
i haven't said much aboutanything lately, but a REAL quick review....
snow*fall was da sh*t-gaga was different!
freak show was fun, i met some really nice folks 
and tried out my new camera taking pix of the cool sculptures.
i'm planning on going to superfly from youngstown, anyone needing a 
ride is welcome to one....   trouty....

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the

FREAK SHOW - The Overlords - 2.10.96 - Dayton, OH
-------------------------------------------------

went down w/ sleepy c, jinx, & carol. if u've never hung out w/ steve
before, u don't know what yur missing - and i thought jinx talked alot.
steve's got more horror stories than stephan king! made a pit stop in 
columbus. so steve could go down w/ doughboy & to pick up liz. we were
s'posed to meet up w/ jeff/stuff in columbus w/ his car load but he wuz
delayed. 

got to dayton at approx. 10pm - the time jinx wuz s'posed to go on,
but they were still doing sound checks, so me & jinx shot some hoop.

DA SPACE

the main area was the basketball court of a boys club. side room
wuz the recreation room. there was also a blacklit backroom w/ some
freaky photos & the hallways served as chill spaces. oh yah, my man,
dan the man spam also had his morbid li'l art display table there too 
(another kat who owes me $).

DA MUZIK

JINX - opened up w/ chicago hard trax - cajmere - cameras ready prepare
to flash remix (one of my personal favs). then started getting into 
old skool hip hop, which i didn't care too much for. but i'm pretty
sure he did it for carol aka girley girl productions (who i coincidentally
took to her 1st out of state rave) and bobby & forrest (RSC), whom i
later had a li'l circle dance with. that is 'til i started losing all
my money & cards all over the floor - gotta get me some dance pants w/
velcro pockets to keep all my shits from slipping out!

SIR AQUAVIVA - had a li'l chat w/ da man before his set, kinda surprised
he remembered me snappin his pic the last time he played in akron. i wuz 
wonderin how john would start things off w/ jinx finishing off w/ his
old skool hip hop set. but john had some old skool selections of his
own, after all this man has one of the largest record collections in 
the midwest. later on when he started getting into the detroit hard trax,
he had just about every kid (about 700 or so) including myself throwing
down - definitely the climax of the night, altho not as memorable as his
set at IO2 - that set wuz legendary.

SLEEPY C & DOUGHBOY TAG TEAM - talk about a dream team. altho doug's
selections were usually harder, the two seemed to work pretty well
together. i wuz especially impressed w/ steve since he's more of a  
'track man' & doesn't usually cater to the crowd as much. since his
roots come from producing music, every now & then he'll play a track
that is better to stand there & listen to than dance to. my fav duo
is still sleepy c & astroboy, remember rebirth 2 - morning acid at
it's best!

DJ BOB - the only back room dj i remember cuz someone had introduced
me to him for the 1st time. i dunno what it is 'bout this guy, but
he just throws off a shady vibe, as a result i just couldn't get into
his set either - prolly cuz he wuz spinnin alotta jungle too. jungle
plus shady character equals double whammy for stevie t, sorry.

welp we didn't stay long enuff to catch any other dj's cuz carol had
to leave early cuz she had to work, so let's talk about the main 
reason i go to partys:

THE PEOPLE & THE VIBE

it wuz real fun throwin down w/ forrest & bobby eventho i lost so
much money, tee hee - but atleast it kept things from being too
serious - like when bobby kicked that kid sitting there out of the
circle - i didn't think that wuz too plury - i kinda felt bad for 
him cuz i don't think he knew better. had a good time hanging out
w/ carol & liz - eventho i had a real hard time finding her at the
end of the night when we were leaving. i wuz really happy to see
jeff/stuff, michael, mary, & the forklift boy (what's his name,
michael!) cuz i wuz worried they got lost or something since we
didn't get to hook up at the idiot boy. later on me & the forklift
did some experimental dancing - this kid just brings a smile to my
face every time. this is what the scene needs more of  kids that
make u smile not kids that just come to partys to put other kids  
down - that's wack. hmm who else michael introduced me to jenny,
who's on this list but i never met. as a result i didn't get to
hang out w/ her too much. but like i told troutsoup at the party,
i'm working on my shyness. he kindly whipped out some hard cider
from his bag o tricks & that helped alot. in fact after that i
stopped worrying about all the negative kids & just totally threw
down. i don't think i danced so hard in a very very long time. i
wuz whipping out all kindsa tripped out wacky moves. i can't even
describe'em. by the time leidra, walt, & the other serious dancers
from columbus hit the floor, i think they were taken aback a little
cuz i don't think they've seen my new 'fuckit i don't give a shit'
experimental style. i think kids were forgetting basically a rave
is just a hyped up party, the only way yur gonna have any fun is 
if u stop being so damn serious & just let loose & have a good time.
i think i put it best when i wuz talkin w/ this dancer i wuz tradin
moves w/ from kentucky:

me: y'know what i saw the best move tonight...
him: what's that?
me: this party, dude!

so in a nutshell Freak Show got a thumbs up from Stevie T, i hope
the positivity catches on tho...

---

LEGAL! - Jinxspot Productions - 2/12/96 - Columbus, Ohio
--------------------------------------------------------

oh btw if u got the flyer for this party at Freak Show & thought
it wuz lame, it's becuz i whipped 'em up in an hour cuz the guy
who wuz s'posed to do 'em, didn't & jinx asked me last minute.
alls i can say is u can't beat 400 flyers for 8 bux! i am to kinkos
as Norm is to Cheers. plus i thought it seemed a bit more personal
since it wuz an invitation rather than the standard ole flyer.

actually at first i wuzn't gonna head down for this party cuz i
had to work, then last minute i decided to skip work to help jinx
out. it wuz a good thing i did cuz they were gonna take carol's
car down & i know carol's car would never have made it thru that
li'l blizzard we had to drive thru - just like the one before
Helium in columbus. but everytime i go down to Columbus, it's like
returning to the Source & i think i have a few guardian angels
watching out for me. cuz so many times i've driven down there
thru incredibly crappy weather w/ all kindsa cars getting stranded
on the sides of the road, but we'd come out a-ok, in fact the
weather would actually clear up as we entered columbus!

well as i told mike when we were sitting in the BK before we 
went to the club, i wuz really worried about the party cuz we
only promo'd it two daze ahead plus it wuz on a monday night, to
tell u the truth i wuz certain we would be the only ones at the
party. and when we got to the Edge at 10pm - when it wuz s'posed
to start i wuz right - we & the bartenders & the other dj's were
the only ones there.

nevertheless DJ Dimentia kicked things off to an empty dance floor.
it's kinda funny watchin this dude cuz here's this big bartender/
bouncer spinnin techno rekkids - and he wuz perdy decent too.

by the time Mikey D went on, there were a few stranglers: charles's
ex-girl who i had just met when she rode back from us from snow*fall,
came w/ a few of her friends & there a few bar hoppers, but the place
wuz still pretty empty. so mike & i played some foosball & carol 
listened to her hip hop tapes.

i wuz getting worried, so i went outside to call some friends, just
so they could pay for the space. i made a couple calls, but alotta  
kids just weren't in.

actually by the time Mike went on, i wuz kinda impressed there wuz
prolly 25 kids there & most of 'em were dancing. i wuz especially
happy to see Crystal there, who i finally got the nerve to talk to
at Freak Show after seeing her for the fourth time - gave her some
of my skittles. hmm lesse desmond showed up & sported me serveral
cups from his pitcher. those along w/ the beers i had before at the
bar, really helped me destress. i really needed 'em cuz it wuz s'posed
to be a birthday party & i wuz all stressin.

actually by the time Jinx came on, i wuz totally in a perdy good mood,
in fact i had a li'l dance battle w/ purple joe, the ex-motorcycle man.
the number of kids there had doubled & a majority of 'em were dancing.
there actually wuz a vibe at the party! doughboy came out for ele
mental represents. paul came out but didn't dance much. shawn & walt,
finally after getting off from working at the video store! but the
best surprise for me wuz when jenny brought rob down & rob got on &
tagged w/ jinx for a li'l bit. that wuz definitely the highlight of
the evening cuz last time the two met in columbus on rob's b-day, it
wuzn't on good terms. but i'm glad to see things are all good now.

afterhours wuz held at the idiot boy, but we couldn't stay long cuz
carol had to work the next day plus the vibe wuz gettin a bit weird,
too many kids up too late on a monday night.

surprisingly the party wuz a mild success, jinx actually earned a li'l
b-day money & on top of that learned a li'l lesson in life. thru rain
or shine, sleet or snow, only yur true friends will come thru for u at
the end. happy b-day jinx! 21 years on this planet, so what do u have
planned for the next 21 years?

i learned a li'l from this party also. it's these small hi-vibed partys
that can really help keep yur faith in the scene or more so the kids in
the scene, after all it's the kids that are the future.

all praise due to the kids of the future, of today, and of the past.

Precedence: bulk

Some people have asked me what is gonna be set up at that event on April 20th. 
To start a lot of equipement. It will be a nightmare for me and my crew but 
also a challenge. I will make a very large invesment to build all the speakers 
and purchase lots of amps.

the main room sound :

20 Bass bins each containing 2 Gauss 18" (Gauss is the speaker manufacturer in 
the world as far as concert speakers). total power handling : 32 000 real 
watts continous.
12 Mid-high long throw clusters containing one 12" Gauss horn loaded and 1 2" 
Titanium Gauss constant directivity horn loaded . total power handling : 8 400 
watts.
The speaker will make a 58.3 feet long wall. All the speaker will be phase 
aligned for high sound quality. My main conserne is quality not louded (*even 
though I can reach 138 db with the Bassaurus rex, but I never push to that 
point)
Those speakers will be powered by Carver amps : a little army of Racks 
containing one PT 2400, 1 PM 1201 and one PM 600.
The dj's will have 2 1501 monitors (1000 watts each) 
The quality of the sound will be taking care by a 3 way stereo 24 DB / oct 
Xover and 6 compresors, two for the high, 2 for mid and two for the bass. 
everything will be in stereo except the bass. If you were at Technosaurus II, 
12 bass bin made some people sick. Imagine 20... :)

The second and third room sound :
the sound will be have :
12 Bass bins each containing 2 EV 18 BX (the new version) handling 20 000 
watts.
12 mid high clusters containing one 12" Gauss horn loaded and 1 2" Titanium 
Gauss constant directivity horn loaded. total power handling : 8 400 watts.
Those speakers will be powered by Carver amps and Crown amps

The total power consumption just for the sound will be around 3 X 6 : 3 phase 
at 600 amps each......216000 watts...enough to feed 30 houses.
We will use other 1000 ft of 1 gauge feeder cable (cable being wider than your 
big toe).

For the lights, I will have more info later, but I can garantee you a light 
show like you have never seen before in the midwest. if you have seen better 
in the midwest at a rave that size, I will give you a 15" Svga screen since 
all of you are on a computer and my collection of fliers (other 800 fliers 
collected in the US and Europe since 1989)

French E at Maxximum Sound and Lights.
if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

        Fine, but how efficient are each of these cabinets at, say, 100 Hz, 1
W RMS, at 1 meter?  What typical sound pressures do you expect from each
cabinet at 100 Hz, 1 m, given that you'll be driving them with the amplifiers
mentioned below??

>Those speakers will be powered by Carver amps : a little army of Racks
>containing one PT 2400, 1 PM 1201 and one PM 600.

        How much power can these put out, given the loads that they'll be
driving?

>The dj's will have 2 1501 monitors (1000 watts each)

        1000 watts RMS to the drivers, or do they each _consume_ 1000 W?
Please clarify.  Unless you've posted this to the local electric company, power
consumption is of much less interest to the reader than an accurate estimate of
sound pressure levels, particularly typical sound pressure levels in the 20-100
Hz range at, say, 5 meters.

pb-cle's chief lurker (that's me) had a question:

why is it i only find out parties in lorain after they happen?

well, i've got a theory: the flyers never say lorain. they say cleveland.

i could see if a party was in parma cleveland heights middleburg heights
westlake lakewood or berea saying ``cleveland.''

but i've lived way out west for a while, and i can tell you lorain is 
definitely not cleveland. it's like confusing youngstown with cleveland.

that's my theory. it's either that or i keep deleting the wrong messages.

i'd sure like to hear about lorain parties. i'm getting sorta old (25!) and
it's been a while since i've been to a party, but i know i'd stop at one in
lorain.

even tho this weekly event going on in kent isnt a "rave" in the
conventional sense of the word, i thought it still deserves a little
review, because this was the 1st nite of it. by the way, everybody 
here is still trying 2 think of a name for it, so if youve got 
suggestions, please post them or mail them.

i had been worried all day that not enough people would show up or the
wrong kind of people or that nobody would dance or they would have
only 1 d.j. or no lighting.
so i got there just as it was starting + they were playing something
really slow, but i saw they had a few lasers & lights set up & a fog
machine + 1 of those gauzy things hanging up that they shoot the
lasers onto. 
bert (1 of the promoters) told me they had 3 d.j.s, synapse, pulse, + 
kenny; but i know i saw at least 4 people spinning that nite. soon
they put on something a little faster + people started showing up. by 
about 11, the place was packed & a-lot of people were out there
dancing. 
i think its great there were so many people there considering that it 
seems that the publicity for this was largely word-of-mouth, because 
the only flyers up until now that i know of had been a few hand drawn 
1s hanging up around here. but yesterday i finally finished the 1 ive 
been designing on the computer. so copies of it should be around
soon. its the 1 thats got japanimation pictures on it. so with more
publicity, this party should be getting bigger.
another good thing that was interesting was the variety of people
there. i saw people i always see at parties, but also i saw people i
only see there on other nites (meaning not "raver types") + some
people ive never seen before. and it seemed like everybody there was 
pretty into it.
around 1:30 i think was when the last d.j. went on, he might have been
kenny or maybe somebody else, i know he wasnt pulse or synapse. but he
was ripping it up. he was really good. i think he was the 1 who played
the parliament sample--"thats the law around here. u got 2 wear youre
sunglasses. so u can feel cool." yeah.
it went on until about 3, because thats when they close, but there
were still plenty of people dancing til the end.
this party will probably have 2 move soon, probably 2 the garage,
which is just across the st + a couple bldgs down--because its a
bigger space & i think it can stay open later. if that happens, ill 
post it as soon as i find out.

greta--

i'm an ameteur jockey of the vynil grooved discs and would be willing and 
happy...damn near extatic to be able to assist this cause by offering my services to 
your scene.  i live in the northwest suburbs of chicago (chicago,  for all practical 
purposes) and play a variety of tunes that mostly centers around house although i've 
been getting into the more progressive drumlines a lot lately.  but almost 
everything but jungle and gabber has a spot in my crate ... so whatever you call 
that, that's the type of music i spin.

so there.  as you (or whomever) plan the upcoming weeks, keep that in mind (the 
weekend of feb 23-24 is out tho) and let me know :)

Subject: DJs & mix tapes
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com

Every one loves mix tapes. they crave for it.

Some dj bitch about people making copies about their tapes...

Here is what I got to say :

If the dj pays his MBI and Ascap fees for playing records that other people 
produced, then he can bitch and raise hell.

But since 99% of the fucking dj's don't pay their fees yearly, they should 
shut the fuck up about their tapes or somoeone coping their tapes, or the dj 
should not spin anymore.

I have a shit load of tapes from so many dj (because I record almost every 
show) Imagine how many dj and acts I got on MD, tapes, or VHS ? Why do I do 
that, because I love music, but that does not mean I am gonna mass-produice 
each DJ I record. Actualy, I don't even make copies because I don't have the 
time to do it. Like for IO2, I am the only one with the original recording of 
that weekend, including video. A lot of people want copies, I will not do it 
because I went thru the trouble of setup my whole system and running it the 
whole weekend, I deserve to be the only one with the original digital tapes. 
There is only one person that has a copie and it is JJ because he put a lot of 
time and effort to bring IO2 together. Peace JJ

Farquar, one of the dudes who threw Freak Show wrote me & sed:

=================================================================
        Enjoyed the review and am glad you had a good time, but there was one
thing I wanted to point out.  BOB didn't spin any jungle.  Puddin spun jungle,
and he spun right after BOB so I can see how you might have gotten confused.
 Sorry about the vibe you picked up from BOB, he really is a nice guy, that is
one of the reasons we got him.  We don't like to book DJ's w/bad attitudes or
who are just plain mean.
        Again, I am glad you had a good time, and I want to give ya some props
for all the help you've done.  Please, be prepared for the next Overlord party,
23 Skidoo, comming in July.  Talk to you soon.
                                        PEACE!
                                                Farquar
=================================================================

just wanted to clear that up & to get the word out about the next
Overlords party coming up.

EXTREME - Bump - 2/16/96 - Cleveland
------------------------------------ 

DA SPACE

if u haven't been to Bump, it's located at Club Lochio's (sp?)
formerly Abruzzi's at 115th & Clifton in Lakewood, OH. actually
the space ain't all dat. small bar. small dancefloor. couple
tables in the back. minimal lighting. actually the main problem
is the space, its just not dancer friendly. the scarey thing is
i think the owner mentioned he wanted to make the dancefloor
smaller & add more tables, yikes.

DA MUSIC

problem #2. all little known local dj's & no guests = no draw.
i think the guest this past friday wuz mike fifer, my ole roomy,
and the only reason i went. but ended up missing the end of his
set cuz we had to go - have to work @ 9 in the morning. but from
what i caught, it seemed all good. mike wuz always keen on track
selection. and his skills are gettin better. kevin (dj fuzz) &
kurt (release) the residents spun also. it's too bad cuz both
these guys are pretty decent. but what can i say, negativity
only gives birth to negativity.

DA PEOPLE & DA VIBE 

i think there wuz twenty kids there (including all the dj's, the
bartender, the doorman, & the friends of dj's). da vibe - the place
wuz dead. no dancers whatsoever. truly sad, i wish i went to kent
that night, greta.

---

CHINESE NEW YEAR - Spawntaneous - 2/17/95 - Cleveland
-----------------------------------------------------

DA SPACE

virgin space - some tavern close to the airport. the space wuz kinda
empty when jeff & i showed up. but soon filled to capacity - 200 plus
by the end of the night. my only complaint - the dance floor wuz slippery
as fuk!                             

DA LASERS

mad props to jamie for the fly laser set up w/ cheesy lines like 'where's
my flashlight' to girlz dancin to all kindsa tripped out geometric patterns.
later on i also got to meet steve of centrak who wuz also there assistin'
w/ the lasers.           

DA MUZIC

alex aka tik tak opened up w/ some jungle, which jeff's friend aron dug cuz
he's a jungle dj. later on i introduced aron to alex. i think the best
part about alex's set wuz the huge alien head he had set up by the
dj stand w/ the flashing eyes - hypnotic.

all the detroit dj's (will webb, james covert, adam haupt, & rolando)
kicked my ass all night long. most notable set wuz by rolando - mucho
skillz w/ superior selection got all the kids dancin'. adam kicked his
set off with the classic jak trak & wuz smooth the whole way thru.
talked w/ him afterwards. told him his bro put out on of my fav mixed
tapes, but i guess he doesn't talk w/ him much. i betcha he feels like
matthew hawtin.

also yopu (g-force, akron) & gank (spawntaneous cleveland) made for 
some keen local represents. kevin just seems to get better & better.

DA PEOPLE & THE VIBE

there wuz actually kids dancin'! but the floor didn't help out - way
too slippery from all the snow & sweat. good to see my new dancer
friends: mary & sinead stirrin' things up. later on they stirred things
up at denny's with us. i dunno what it is but i hardly recognized anybody
at this party except for the old skoolers. even had a chat w/ mike filly,
kevin bumpers, & dan curtin who showed briefly for the party but didn't
stay too long. i think they felt as out of place as i did - too old or
too clean! hell i wuz so tired i fell asleep in the back for an hour, but
this wuz cuz i worked from 9 to 1 in the mornin w/ four hours sleep cuz
i went to extreme the night before.

---

MEKKA - Ele Mental - 2/18/96 - Columbus, Ohio
---------------------------------------------

so me, jinx, & carol head down cuz jinx had forgotten one of his 'b-day
presents' there from his b-day party. we chilled a bit at jonathan's
aka dj sense, dj anthony, & dj animate's pad w/ all their buds. 
coinkidinkly all three will be spinning this weekend for walt's party
- SUPERFLY (plug! plug!), so y'all should come check it out cuz they're
all kewl kats! then the whole crew headed down to mekka

first off i wanna say thanx & also a happy b-day to doug aka doughboy
who i gave us all free passes @ the door - much appreciated it. word
is doug wuzn't the only b-day boy that night - happy belated b-day kevy
kev!

second off i wanna say whoever that bartender wuz w/ cheesy 'spam' shirt
on - fire that motherf__ker! god damned prejudiced ass piece a sh!t 
wouldn't serve me! if it wuzn't for jeff aka purple joe, who graciously
had to point the ass my direction, i would never have gotten the drinks.

actually we owe purple joe thanx X2 cuz it wuz also him who held jinx's
b-day present. plus he also brought crystal, fly girl, who got me my 
drink cuz i knew 'spam' boy wouldn't serve me. speakin o fly girlz, it
wuz good to see my ole girley - jenny w/ rob, of course. too bad he
wuzn't able to hang out & spin some records w/ us afterwards.

lesse gave placebo & ed their pics from azure & snow*fall. chatted a li'l
w/ mr.ramos. got to see melissa & walt again. along w/ paul, desmond, and  
shawn. then it wuz off to the circles...

i guess leidra brought down her new roommate, dave, a breaker from new
york. this kat has got skillz. boy wuz all over da flo', rippin shits
up! he's got that comic relief thing going on too. there wuz also this
foursome from columbus & youngstown who had that team work thing going.
oh yah some cheesy ass asian kid w/ a 'think' cap wuz throwin down also.
but we won't talk about him. i'd rather talk about powerhouse in the
circle o death & i thought i had seen it all. hell even bad boy yakov
fronted me, but some li'l adidas chick took care o him. gotta luv it 
when chicks u don't even know have got yur back!

gawd damn everybody & their mama wuz throwin down! columbus has got a
vibe so thick u'll need a kazillion watt laser to cut thru it!

oh yah some dude named sleepy g or p or c or somethin' from cleavageland
or sumptin wuz spinnin' i guess he wuz ok :P word is he had to spin the
whole night cuz the other dj who wuz s'posed to spin wuz too drunk cuz
it wuz his b-day, hmmmm.

afterwards the whole crew went back to jonathan's pad to spin & smoke.
speakin o smokin, the fourth time wuz the charm that night - talk about
freaky - atleast the lights didn't go out. i guess the start of one
sabatical is the end of another sabatical. i did the best i could. i m
mortal.

---

CHILL 216 - Universal Vibe - 2/19/96 - Cleveland
------------------------------------------------

what to do on a monday night w/ no work cuz it's a holiday? why u go to
chill 216 in tremont.

DA SPACE

it's a small bar w/ tables (both turntables & the kind u sit at) in the
back. there's also an art display that gets changed once a month back
there. 

VISUALS

'pulp fiction' on the boob tube

DA MUSIC

house set by resident johnny mac. besto w/ old skool hip hop. jinx w/
da jungle.

DA PEOPLE & THE VIBE

very chill - thus its name - chill 216. chat w/ johnny the bartender  
or the other locals that go there - mostly kewl kats. watch carol &
claire groove to the tunes. and smoke. dats about it. not bad for no
door costs. 

of course late night breakfast at 'our friends' is an added bonus.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

        John Breslin ("john.breslin@ucg.ie") recently informed me of the
existence of an Isao Tomita home page ("http://weber.ucg.ie/tomita.html").
Isao Tomita is a seminal Japanese electronic music pioneer and showman whose
musical achievements of twenty years ago are formidable even by today's
standards.  I highly recommend a look; you may be surprised to find how strong
Tomita's influence has been in electronic music, including styles associated
with raves.

        Beware: this page contains Netscape-specific extensions that are not
entirely compatible with standard HTML browsers.

        John Breslin forwarded me the following:

    Went to Protokulture last night.  Got there about 11:30.  Smoov did
a kickin' set of funked-up trax, only to be followed by some phat
scratching by Supa-C, during which the attention was unfortunately
focused on the same three people dancing in the circle (with the
exception of that gymnast).  His set was really supa.  187 and Soy Sos
did a little reggae/jungle jammie after that which had a few technical
difficulties (but was really cool none the less).  Then came Damien's
set, which was really good except for the records skipping a little -
Soy said it was too much bass, but I'm not too sure.  Anyhow,  the
eagerly awaited 187 full-length came around and it was really kickin' -
especially the track that started out with the electric piano.  Soy Sos
spent most of the time reminding us all how much we hate the Klu Klux
Klan, but he has good rhythm so it was interesting none the less.
    After a good 45 minutes of live thrashing, Sine and Ruffian got off
to a rough start when, during "6 million ways to die", some jerky
knocked over one of the speakers and fucked up the tape player and said
speaker, which for obvious reasons broke the set up somewhat.  All
accidents nonwithstanding, what I saw of their hardstep mixing was
really fly.  Kudos to both.  Then I left, 'cause I was tired and had to
clean my house the next day.

    This was by far the most personal of the UDG events I've been to.  A
bit too small for the number of people there, but much more enjoyable
than Perpetual Motion or the Science Center.  I'd like to see 187 do a
longer set, perhaps without interruptions by an MC. And why was Sine on
solo at 6:00?

Sorry for the wicked xpost, but I gotsta do what I gotsta do, dig? 

Hi, I'm Count Zer0 ;) and. . .
I am now available for booking. :) (like I wasn't before) I spin
chilled out groovy eclectic tunes ranging from ethnic "world music"
type stuff, to "trip hop,"  to intelligent jungle, to progressive and
ambeint house, to straight up ambient music.  Stick me in a chillroom
and I'll be happy, book me at an all chill event, and I'm happier ;)
Even consider me for early morning/late party time slots, cuz people
like to come down, and I can get up-beat too. So, if you'd like to
hear a tape, just email me back. ALSO, anyone who didn't get a tape at
Mosaic or ANYONE who just wants a copy, send me email and we'll work
things out. :) My latest mixtape is "Count Zero's Magic Journeys" and
it is eclectic to the max. :) I also still have my OLD OLD tape "The
Dying Art of Chill" and the mosaic spot winning "Experimental Spheres"
(as soon as I can get it back from Dan Freelove :)  So, feel free to
get in touch with me, also, PLEASE pass this on to any promoters you
know. Here's all my stats, btw.

by now anyone who cared about this party will know that it was busted at 
4am.  i'd like to reiterate on behalf of the superfly cru that the bust 
was pretty stupid, and only happened because of one police officer who 
felt he had "precedent" over the situation, ie, his word was law.  

the afterhours at idiot boy turned out wonderfully if a bit packed 
(actually a LOT packed from what i heard...i arrived at 9am), so i hope 
people walked away from this whole evening with a smile.

mike huckaby DID show up in town, but got lost on the way to the 
space...at this moment i'm not sure what happened to him (colin?!).  but 
the event, while it was going, was pretty fun and the music was pumpin!

i finally heard stevenj spin for once, it was great to see him.  next 
time you see him thank him personally for being our list maintainer!!

lesseee, i heard sammee, he dropped in, and i also heard titonton's micro 
set (abbreviated by the bust), and greg sargent spun for a short while as 
well.  the afterhours included nice sets by mighty, greg again, blonde-haired
anthony, and finally me and mighty tagging for a while to close things 
off.  AND I'M STILL UP!!  sheesh, i just realized that...

anyway, look for these guys to throw another event in the future...walt, 
colin, helena, marty, todd dreamsicle, and those i'm forgetting...mad 
props to you and next time hire the damn cops ;)

GOOD NIGHT.

MOVE FREELY
-----------

enter we: into this filthy dark abandoned theater
one by one we enter accumulating hundreds.
the energy from illegal actions vaporizes and
reverberates and it grows unto itself.
huddled in corners, they sit with deep smiles of
contentment for the realization of the family
succumbs them.
aimless souls pass to and fro anticipating the
groove of the DJ.
plug in: electricity snaps the equipment and rages
forth at 420hz.
a mob of joyous cheers boom throughout the room
which heightens the energy.
we sway, dart, shake, move hard, groove hard.
the conductor DJ slaps new and old vinyl spirals
producing the repititious hypnotics and trance-like
effects.
the main lights fall into blackness, a mere digression
until the boom cannon techni-kolor disco lights
pierce through completeing the visual illusion.
we are deaf. communication resorts to dance.
some tell you stories, others use single words or
paragraphs.
but one must comprehend the sign language to
catch the storyteller's words.
3 levels are represented here: those into an
oblivious drug psychosis, the dancers catching
musical vibes, and the communicators giving and
receiving information and absorbing positive vibes.
intellectually speaking, speaking with a faith about
things unproveable, positivity is teleported through
vibes bouncing back and forth, snow balling and
reaching a nirvana peak happiness in those who
send and receive.
that's the bottom line in 'rave' culture
and not the drug use.
and not the dealers, for these unfortunate souls
miss the big picture.
imagine going to a movie with your eyes and ears
covered. synomynous action.
drugs are not the evil predator but they sometimes
dampen and confuse which brings out
misinformation. moderate yourselves.

- peace and love -

(from the january plrm)

And without a doubt the act that made the party was Rabbit in the Moon,
one of techno's finest live acts. For me witnessing 'Bunny' antics on
stage was extra special for more reasons than one. When Bunny first
appeared, he seemed so prehistoric, a hairy beast with elongated arms
groping at the audience. But he was unafraid & he dove into the crowd
& became one with them. When Bunny appeared next he appeared less
intimidating, in fact he looked pretty cool in his neon blue & orange
costume. He showed the crowd his appreciation by tearing open a toy
icon of himself & offering the crowd his goodies. Then Bunny appeared
in a costume composed entirely of multiple strands of glow strings.
And when he joined with the crowd once more, everyone grabbed a piece
of him. When he appeared again, he was covered from head to toe with
a hundred little pieces of mirror that reflected all that was around
him. And when light was cast upon the rabbit, a thousand points of 
light eminated from his body. In his final appearance Bunny grabbed
an electric sander & continued to grind his face as sparks flew in all
directions. At first it appeared self destructive, but at the end
everyone realized his sparkeling vision.

i hope to be remembered as the rabbit & not the bull.

HI, I'm Leslie, the girl who handed out the fruit at Family Affair, and I
have something else great to tell you about. I am one of many ravers who
really appreciates the unique energy in our scene, and recently I saw
something with this same special energy coming from outside our scene, which
is a TECHNO BALLET. It's called Sudden Impulse, choreographed by David Nixon,
music by World Techno Tribe, and danced by BalletMet Columbus. 
       
Actually, calling it a ballet might give some people the wrong idea because
it's really way fresh jazz and funk moves and it is EXCITING !!! I got to
see it last September and it blew me out of the water. Richard, one of the
dancers, said that when they did it in Toronto, they got standing ovations
every night.

******************************************************************         
         If you want to experience Sudden Impulse, call 614-341-7310 A.S.A.P.
and leave your name and number and how many tickets you want.
****************************************************************** 

They are $15 and $25 but I have a limited number that I am selling for 
only $12 (good seats!) plus I am throwing an after hours on March 1, 
which is FREE if you buy a ticket to the show. I'm doing this because I 
want as many people as possible to get a chance to see this.

        There are three other great pieces on the program: Stepping 
Stones, by Kaand a funny piece by Peter Pucci (he worked on Billboards, 
the piece that the Joffrey Ballet did to Prince's music)plus Peter Pucci 
will be dancing a live solo called Sing. The whole show is about 2.5 -3 
hours, including intermission. It's at the Riffe Center on State and 
High. I'll be enclosing directions when you get your ticket.

REMEMBER: THERE MAY NOT BE ANY TICKETS LEFT BY SHOW TIME, SO GET YOURS
A.S.A.P.! DON'T MISS THIS UNIQUE EXPERIENCE !

614-341-7310


(ed's note:  the performance begins early and will be over by 10, then 
the afterhours will start shortly thereafter)

I had a good time at ProtoVulture, too.  I didn't get there until around 
1:30, so it was said that no more tickets would be sold and that no-one 
who didn't have a wristband could get in because of some code or 
another.  Anyways, I didn't find out about that until after I had already 
been upstairs :-)  I kept waiting for someone to ask me for money at a 
door and next thing I knew I has up standing by the turntables watching 
DieselBoy spin.  Very interesting set and I liked Soy Sos on the mic, the 
dance floor was nice (except for all the photographers in everyone's 
face!).  I then wound up chillin' in the Karoke bar with a few friends 
until about 2:30, when the upstairs started to thin out and we all 
finally got in the space, since there was now enough room as the place 
had begun to clear out.  (Pittsburgh crowds sure seem to go home early!)  
Sine and Ruffian had some good sets (watch out for flyin' speakers!)  In 
all, that space is quite interesting ... Karaoke all night and drum 'n' 
bass to boot.  Sure is 'nuff Jungle spinnin' these days!

peaceout,
Farmer

CHERRY - 2/23/96 - Kent, Ohio
-----------------------------  

PRE-PARTY B.S.

welp at 1st i wuz thinkin 'bout skippin dis party cuz everybody knew
it wuz one of those 'more underground' type partys of the psychedelics
nature (thus it's invitation only status). plus one of the promotors
bro's still owed two of my friends large sums of money for bailin his
ass on two occasions. but what can i say...in a wack world, if that's
the game u wanna play, that's the game u hafta pay.               

but then they chopped the price in half plus aron & jinx were buggin me
about it, so i sed what the fuk...

carol bailed cuz she wuz one of the said friends & james took her place.
the four of us headed down to kent. we made a pit stop to pick up some
'beverages' then hit the map point across from JB's in Kent. jinx & james
didn't have invitations, but luckily wendy wuz workin the map point. she 
gave us direx to the party, which turned out to be some cleared out tavern
right down the road from the map point.

we got there around 11:30pm, and of course willy wuz workin the door (hadn't
seen him since Miracles) - good thing cuz there wuz no way they would've
let in my friend aron aka 'cherry' boy if he wuzn't workin door.

at this point aside from us, the dj's, the promotors, and a few other kids,
the place wuz pretty much empty. so we headed in the vip rooms to chat w/
the promotors & drop off our brew. it wuz a good thing we bought'em or else
we would've been bored shitless the first hour cuz it wuz so dead. luckily
my friend lady ms. lisa showed up w/ her friend melanie, who i hung out w/
most of the night. lisa got so bored she whipped out her roller skates &
started skatin' around the place - fukkin looney. unfortunately she would
later forget about 'em at the party, so if u know the where abouts of said
skates u know what to do. the two of 'em also helped me w/ my brew too. i
like how kids dub u an alcholic if yur holding a beer...shit talk at it's 
best.

DA MUSIC

BESTO   

speakin o best, tony aka besto wuz workin the tables the first hour. but i
had just heard him at Chill 216 on monday plus i'm not the biggest hip hop
fan. but i like him as person, he's a real kewl kat. later we chatted about
his new mixed tape. which i got to hear later on thanx to carol on our trip
down to Superfly. phat mix if u dig hip hop.

SLEEPY C

as usual steve tore up. but i just heard him this past sunday. plus wouldn't
wanna make his head any bigger than it already is :P 

MIKE HUCKABY

smooth mixin. but i dunno i think he's spun better. perhaps he wuz not pleased
w/ the crowd or lack there of. nevertheless, he did the same thing he did to me
at Minimal State - made me dance my ass off. traded a few words w/ him later on.
he asked what kids liked around here. i told him the truth. i told him drugs. i
don't think he knew what this particular party wuz about. fortunately i think my
bud jinx made for some better conversation for him.

NIGEL RICHARDS

tricky mother f'ers tried to dupe ole stevie t by changin the line-up. even had
a few of yur bastard children come up & ask me to test me. so i played yur game
& gave u yur own medicine. fuk the musik give me the acid?...fuk the acid give
me the musik? fuk all u shady bastards, i played the rabbit & self destructed.
and showed my kids how stupid yur game is. 'played' is the key word, do u know
how hard it is to just stand there & make like yur tweakin when nigel is throwin
down track after track of yur favorite acid (of the musik variety)? don't u
think i would recognize the man,  especially after a Rave Called Scott 2? thank
u Nigel for being a good sport, like i said someone's gotta show the kids. btw
i'm glad it's all good now.

ERIC M'Fukin HAUPT

before eric went on,  i told him i met his bro last week & remembered him from
the pic i took at Teknosaurus 2 - to which he replied: 'huh?' no matter cuz
eric is the man, he is the prodigical son. he blew out the candles and laid it
ALL to rest. words can not describe. i wish i could've danced more, but my
friend Jinny from Rochester had a slight problem - she had locked her keys in
her car & we had to help her out. where is mr. haupt spinnin next?

AFTER PARTY B.S.

afterwards,  we tried to no avail to break into Jinny's car. but i think the
hardest part wuz finding a hanger & actually getting out there. hopefully she
got a hold of a cop to jimmy it for her. cops - u may hate'em for what they have
to do but they'll also be the ones to get u outta yur worst jams. life is ironic
like that some times. but that's life.

kinda surprised the party broke even - more kids showed up later on that night.
prolly 250 total. kinda surprised greta showed up, but it wuz by where she
went to school.

comin up next...stevie's review of Superfly...

This is the final addition to the bassrush (March 20th, Louisville, 
KY)line-up.  

SPICELAB will be performing live for a 1-1 1/2 hour set at bassrush 
midwest rush on April 20th.  

For those who don't know Oliver Lieb - Spicelab, Paragliders, LSG and 
others- is one the best if not the best trance producers in germany, he 
is certainly my favorite.  He will be performing material from spicelab, 
both the older harthouse stuff and some new material from his new label 
SPy vs. Spice, as well as the material he released on superstition as LSG 
and paragliders.

Subject: Derrick May in CLUB WIRED RealAudio, 1 March, 6pm PST
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com

Derrick May, the DJ whose "Rhythm is Rhythm" practically launched
the House style, and who stayed out of the studio for years after
that, is finally back and on tour. He'll be stopping at the HotWired
studios in San Francisco to do a special 2-hour live RealAudio show.
If you have RealAudio, you can hear him spin the platters. If you
have telnet, you can also hang out in the "Club Wired" room and chat
with fellow techno fans from all over the world, and ask questions
for Derrick to answer.

On March 1, from 6-8 pm PST, hear Derrick May in the thrilling sound
of RealAudio. Go to http://www.hotwired.com/club/ for all the details.

"To find out more about Derrick May's current tour, go to:
<http://www.manmade.com/transmat.html>."

If anybody has ANY complaints about my sending what amounts to an
advertisement to a semi-private mailing list, I personally voiced
concern over this, but was assured by my bosses that Derrick May
thought y'all wouldn't mind. I will be happy to pass along any
opinions you want to express, but please don't yell at me, ok?

SUPERFLY - Joint Ventures - 2.24.96 - Columbus, Ohio
----------------------------------------------------

YUP DAT PRE-PARTY B.S. Y'ALL SHOULD BE USED TO BY NOW...

So after killing mucho time at Carol's pad the four of us (Carol,
Jinx, James, & myself) decided to head out to cow town yet again.
and as usual our 1st stop wuz at the Idiot Boy, where we chilled
w/ the owner, Jason, and his sister, Jennifer - kewl kids. oh yah
Jason wanted me to mention money wuz not lost at the Idiot Boy 
before that party ONE awhile back, since he handled the money
personally. he did point out there wuz a buncha kids at kinko's
making some mad copies of the tix.

our 2nd stop wuz World Records so Jinx could pick up some new hip
hop records. then it wuz off to the venue. alls i can say is who 
ever drew up the maps (cough, walt, cough) did a real shitty job
cuz even kids from columbus had a real hard time finding the place,
which ended up to be some ymca located in some hick town half an
hour east of columbus.

when we got there (around midnight or so) the place wuz still pretty
dead so walt wuz still worried about the turnout, so he had to charge
my ass even tho he knew i wuz the only one who passed out flyers for 
him in cleveland. later on he apologized to me about it. but i told 
him it wuz all good, six bones is no big deal. plus i kinda felt guilty
for fronting him in the circle at mekka last week (i really tore his
shits up).

it wuz good to see my ole columbus buds: scott, shawn, desmond, melissa,
etc. they told us they were still waiting for the sound for the second
room to be set up, but the main room wuz up & ready, so we went & checked
it out...

DA MUZIK

ANIMATE wuz spinnin when we got there. it wuz kinda weird cuz we all just
hung out w/ him less than a week ago & got to see him spin at his pad.
gotta give him props da boy really gets into his sets, he's got that 
titonton booty bouncin thing going on also - so he's real fun to watch
too. his style is dancer friendly hard trance.

STEVEN J - i thought for sure steven would spin ambient stuff. but i guess
he figured he had the main room so he spun some pretty upbeat housey trax
that really got the quickly growing crowd moving. later on finally gotta
meet the man & his woman too. nice couple. had lotsa fun joking around w/
him.

JINX - as promised jinx busted some old skool hip hop, which brought some
smiles with some classics. his timing wuz perfect cuz that's when liedra
came in w/ her new roommate - the breaker from new york. i started gettin
my groove on w/ him but then trouty had to slip me this candy necklace,
which i hadda throw on. by the time jinx wuz closing his set w/ some house
the place wuz completely filled.

TITONTON wuz so funny that night. friggin chompin on a banana right up
front dancin to jinx's set. before he went on i joked that he should try
scratchin the records w/ the banana. but the boy gets serious when he gets
on. no wonder even the slightest distraction (cough, camera flash, cough)
could throw him off cuz the stuff he duz is just sick. but as i told
steven j when we were watchin him, check out how this boy recovers, he  
could even make a mistake sound intentional - skillz.

(unfortunately titonton's set wuz cut short cuz one cop had decided to make
500 kids go home early)

GREG SARGENT - got to spin about 3 records, before walt got on the mic &
had to announce, they had to shut it down. well atleast he got to spin,
my boy, MIKE FIFER, had just got there & didn't get to spin a single 
record. but atleast he got paid for basically doing nothing.

AFTERHOURS

welp we had a bit of a hard time getting back to Columbus cuz some cop
in some hick town decided to pull us over for a padiddle (one blown
headlight) and he made us wait in the car extra long cuz, it took him
half an hour just to run up my license, cuz i've got california plates.
finally they let me go w/ a warning, which wuz a good thing cuz another
ticket & i lose my license. and the freakiest part about it wuz it all
happened around 4:20am - go figure.

welp the Idiot Boy wuz packed when we got there. some dj from dayton
wuz spinning who totally reminded me of tintonton, but of course he
wuzn't. got to see some other columbus buds: paul, elaine, crystal,
clay, stephanie, etc. etc. there wuz even some cleveland kids, i hadn't
seen in awhile: brian who came w/ holly, still the flyest rave chica
out there. the three of us were reminiscing 'bout the old daze. speakin
of old daze, i wuz sportin my sooper old skool, us rave team t-shirt
(circa '92) & the only kid that recognized it wuz this girl from kentucky
of all places. sooper kudos to her, whoever she wuz.

jinx got to spin for awhile, then greg sargent spun this nice long house
set. it wuz kewl watchin kids dance in this li'l coffee joint w/ carpet
& couches at eight in the mornin'. i even threw down a little before we
headed back home around 8:30am. anyone know hiw it went after we left?

after that we hit shoney's which turned out to be a mistake. they should
rename that place "whitey's" after the racist comments we caught toward
jinx & james. we got outta there might quick after that. this is exactly 
one of the best things about the rave scene. u are accepted regardless of
yur color, religion, ethnic background, gender, height, weight, drug
preferences, non-drug preferences, clothes, money, friends, lack of friends,
labor, non-labor, intelligence, ignorance, musical intelligence, musical
ignorance, whatevah! it's all good in our house. let's keep it that way!

pee.ass - aren't u glad i didn't mention the couple doing it on the floor
at the party, ha! ha! had to stick that in there somewhere. i really
should've snapped their picture - ooh gawd! fukkin classic! yes couples
that do the nasty on the floor are even accepted in our house!

Very scary... read to the end and vote...


"I've received information on the following from two different sources.  I urge
you to read through this long message and respond as your conscience and
principles dictate."
Daniel Siegel

Here's what Canada's George Burdi, of the neo-Nazi Heritage
Front, had to say about this vote, on February 21, on his
RESISTANCE mailing list:

   "There is a call for votes
   coming on rec.music.white-power in the next week
   or so, and you will be notified in a special issue of
   RREN exactly what to do.  FOLLOW THE
   INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER.  Let me be
   perfectly blunt and state that we have more than
   enough "net-nazis" to win this thing hands-down.
   But every one of you must vote YES!  And just
   voting yes means nothing unless you do it properly.
   So you have been forewarned.  The instructions
   are coming to your email box soon, and they
   are not complicated.  Just follow them as told,
   and we will have a WP music newsgroup finally!"

If Mr. Burdi's confidence disturbs you, please give this
letter the _widest_ possible distribution, and help us deliver
the largest NO vote in the history of UseNet.

***

If you agree with me, please register your vote. In order to
do that, send a message to: music-vote@sub-rosa.com

The content of the message should read:

    I vote NO on rec.music.white-power

and nothing else.

Do _not_ vote twice - that would constitute voting fraud.

*** If you want more info on this, go to "Bulletings -- Jewish Life" from the
blitz mail screen. ***

I apologize for the off-topic response.  I won't respond further in
public, so if you want to argue about this, please do it in e-mail.

You can vote for a newsgroup if you plan to read it.  You can vote
against a new newsgroup if the name is uninformative or malformed, if
its creation would adversely affect a newgroup you read, or if the
group itself is in some other way problematic or poorly thought-out.
Newgroup creation is not a popularity contest, and it is *not*
appropriate to vote against a newsgroup because you don't like what
people plan to talk about there.  (How do you think the *.drugs.*
newsgroups would do in a general vote?)  In particular, if you don't
read Usenet, don't vote on Usenet.

Also, it's tacky to encourage people to vote without enclosing the
original CFV.  If you plan to vote, please read the CFV for
rec.music.white-power on news.announce.newgroups.

> If you agree with me, please register your vote. In order to
> do that, send a message to: music-vote@sub-rosa.com
> 
> The content of the message should read:
> 
>     I vote NO on rec.music.white-power

You may also substitute "YES", "ABSTAIN", or "CANCEL".  There are
further requirements which *may cause your vote to be discarded*; read
the CFV to find out about them.

I won't vote because the group doesn't directly affect me.  But I'd
really rather have this sort of thing where I can keep an eye on it,
instead of on a private mailing list, or causing endless crossposted
flamewars in other music groups.

Let me say first that I am not a white power supporter by any means.

Now that we have that out of the way, I have to say that it is really
uncool and (ideally) un-american to try to stifle the creation of their
news group or their free speech, regardless of how offensive *you* find it.

And really, who cares if "rec.music.white-power" is approved? If you don't
like what's there, just don't subscribe! There are quite a few news groups
that are out there that I have no interest in, but I am not running around
trying to muster anti-{insert your least favorite news group here}-group
support.

What if there were a more "moral" organization that were opposed to the
rave scene that tried to muster support to crush us from having our
rave-related community online? There are quite a few people in the US that
are definitely anti-rave, and thank god that they have the decency to just
let us "live and let live." I don't want to have to spent all my energy to
defend our right to free speech and collaboration on the Internet. First
"rec.music.white-power" gets attacked, and then who's next? Hyperreal?
"alt.rave"? Get it?

Now let's not get into a "raving is OK vs. rec.music.white-power is not OK"
type argument. That's not the point. At all. The specifics of the topics
are not what my rebuttal is about. It's about free speech, plain and
simple. Nothing more, nothing less.

Uncool?  This has nothing to do with uncool.  This has everything to do 
with making your voice heard against hate and intolerance.

Things such as hate and intolerance must be spoken out against (did that 
make sense?).  By not speaking out, you are basically condoning such 
activities.  There is no half-way on such subjects.  If someone tells a 
racist/anti-semetic/homophobic joke, by not speaking out you are sending 
a message of tolerance of such crap.

I get your point, but I just cannot be convinced by it to sit back and 
say nothing.

Voting against the group is NOT an attempt to limit/discourage 
free-speech.  It is a personal statement of how you feel about the issue 
at hand.  I say the issue is one of unnaceptable hate and loathing of 
people's differences.

Well, all I can say is that if this were a CFV for "rec.music.black-power",
and it were being pushed through by a black-centric group, I would still
feel the same way -- that they have a right to have their home on the net.
And to tell you the truth, I feel that it takes a very strong person so
support THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH of even those you disagree with, even if
they may be your enemies.

I am strong enough to do that.

I wish that everybody were.

-- In comparison to your reply of interolance, I really appreciated the
maturity and intellect of Eli Brandt's <eli@UX3.SP.CS.CMU.EDU> message. I
thought it was right on.

sorry its late again, but skool's a drag sometimes.  tom b. pointed 
out that last week you got a bonus one in syracuse ny, that i thought was 
in pgh for some reason !!??  thanks to stevie t and ed luna for info on 
events (and ed cant even remember the dates of his own partees :)  keving 
mentioned a house partee in cols, but i have no details on that (ed??)  
thanks to stevenj for letting me snip out of his mw-rave calendar.  i saw 
him spin at superfly and wanted to say hi and he disappeared afterwards.  
oh well.....  well,,,,,,on with the show.....

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the

HI, I'm Leslie, the girl who handed out the fruit at Family Affair, and I
have something else great to tell you about. I am one of many ravers who
really appreciates the unique energy in our scene, and recently I saw
something with this same special energy coming from outside our scene, which
is a TECHNO BALLET. It's called Sudden Impulse, choreographed by David Nixon,
music by World Techno Tribe, and danced by BalletMet Columbus. 
       
Actually, calling it a ballet might give some people the wrong idea because
it's really way fresh jazz and funk moves and it is EXCITING !!! I got to
see it last September and it blew me out of the water. Richard, one of the
dancers, said that when they did it in Toronto, they got standing ovations
every night.

******************************************************************         
         If you want to experience Sudden Impulse, call 614-341-7310 A.S.A.P.
and leave your name and number and how many tickets you want.
****************************************************************** 

They are $15 and $25 but I have a limited number that I am selling for 
only $12 (good seats!) plus I am throwing an after hours on March 1, 
which is FREE if you buy a ticket to the show. I'm doing this because I 
want as many people as possible to get a chance to see this.

        There are three other great pieces on the program: Stepping 
Stones, by Kaand a funny piece by Peter Pucci (he worked on Billboards, 
the piece that the Joffrey Ballet did to Prince's music)plus Peter Pucci 
will be dancing a live solo called Sing. The whole show is about 2.5 -3 
hours, including intermission. It's at the Riffe Center on State and 
High. I'll be enclosing directions when you get your ticket.

REMEMBER: THERE MAY NOT BE ANY TICKETS LEFT BY SHOW TIME, SO GET YOURS
A.S.A.P.! DON'T MISS THIS UNIQUE EXPERIENCE !

614-341-7310

(ed's note:  the performance begins early and will be over by 10, then 
the afterhours will start shortly thereafter)
