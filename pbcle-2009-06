             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

www.GMSF.us / www.Gaian-Mind.com / www.Ramblewood.com
NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...

We are bringing some people out of the woodwork for this little baby. 
We've got a little bit of everything to hopefully please every single 
one of you! All these performers will have you dancing from the moment 
the sun disappears until the break of dawn.

Walkingstick - Jungle/reggae jungle/hip-hop [San Fransisco, CA] Five 
years after leaving the 'Burgh for San Francisco... After hundreds of 
thousands of air miles logged... Walkingstick makes his return!

>From 1998 to about 2005 Walkingstick was a very common name to see on a 
flyer in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland region. He was known for his oldskool, 
sample heavy, jungle style, often mixing in hip hop or various tracks 
from around the globe, anything to make it fun for the audience. He was 
also one of the founders of Total Xperience Productions, known for 
throwing memorable events such as NO DOZE, HUMBLE, ICEBURGH, GIFTED, 
HOMEGROWN and many more.

Throughout the years, Walkingstick not only played all throughout the 
USA but has also made numerous tours to Brazil, played shows in Puerto 
Rico, Scotland, etc..

After moving to San Francisco, Walkingstick has lead a much more low-key 
lifestyle, trading the flashing hypnotic lights of clubs and raves for 
staying home and producing his own tracks. Walkingstick has released one 
vinyl record every year for the past 5 years, one release on Jungle 
Riddim Records and four on his own label, Walkingstick World Records. 
All releases on his label have featured various artists and genres from 
around the globe, including artists from Russia, Switzerland and the 
most well-known name in baile funk, Mr. Catra, from Brazil.

So, after 5 years, Walkingstick comes to the 'Burgh, like straight out 
of a time machine to make a very rare performance featuring loads of 
Walkingstick original dubplates and other sounds you've never heard but 
also some classics that will surely keep you moving! Get ready for some 
junglist, dubplate business!!!
WA-WA-WA-WA-WALKINGSTICK!!!!!!!!

long time ago... In a Delorean far far away.. MartyMcFly started mixing

cruisin' over to Toronto in 1995. He.s been mixing da Breaks across 
North America  ever since. His last visit to Pittsburgh was back in 
2007. Marty.s a huge breaker at heart and total mixologist behind the 
decks. His love and enthusiasm for music makes for a shit load of fun 
out on the dance floor.. Calling out all fun funky breakers for this 
one!!!

Shawn Rudiman (Live) - Sexy Techno
[Pittsburgh]
This is a man who needs little introduction. He is truely a consummate 
artist, he prefers to play without the use of computers or software.
he chooses to conduct his sets like a jazz band would: letting every 
machine flow like performers and have their particular freedoms and 
moment to shine.  over 90% of all composition are composed there on the 
spot, for him and the audience to experience together for the first 
time.

7UP (Steel City Funk)
Pittsburgh PA

For longer then many can remember, the name 7up has been synonymous with 
the house scene dropping his unique mixing style at hundreds of events 
and every major nightclub in Pittsburgh and major cities around the 
States. Over Dave.s history he has brought many new styles of house to 
Pittsburgh including Speed Garage in 1997, to the short but sweet 2-Step 
trend that came and went with the millennium, right up the present 
incarnations of deep and funky house which he rocks on the dancefloor, 
leaving a trail of satisfied party goers in his path. As anyone will 
attest to, Dave.s performances are nothing short of AMAZING and filled 
with positive energy which is translated to the people who come to see 
him play. Armed with the latest in music production technology and the 
finest collaborators, Dave Sanchez continues to work on dance floor 
rocking tracks always with the goal of pushing the limits of house.

Subject: {pb-cle} Jasper TX, Anduin, Jeremy Bible & Jason Henry - July 8 Cleveland

Jasper TX
|| Gothenburg, Sweden || http://myspace.com/jaspertx || Miasmah, Kning
Disk, Fangbomb, Fenetre, SMTG Limited
Besides being one half of the rather amazing post-rock duo De La
Mancha, Jasper TX's Dag Rosenqvist has released a number of carefully
drafted and very well received solo recordings with labels such as
Miasmah, Kning Disk, Fangbomb, and Lampse. His work is primarily
guitar driven soundscapes covered in layers of drums, voices, organs,
toy pianos, field recordings, and effects. Comparisons have been made
to artists such as Fennesz, Aidan Baker, and Machinefabriek, with whom
Rosenqvist has done two collaborations. In 2009, he followed 2008's
"Black Sheep" album on Miasmah with a new record titled "Singing
Stones" on Fangbomb and the collaboration with Anduin on SMTG Limited.
This will be Jasper TX's first ever US dates.

Anduin
|| Richmond, Virginia || http://smtgltd.com/anduinore || SMTG Limited
Anduin's Jonathan Lee creates dark, pulsating ambient electronics
soaked in layers of synths, samples, and field recordings. He has
collaborated with a number of international artists including Svarte
Greiner, Jasper TX, Stephen Vitiello, Noah Saval, Xela, Gareth Davis,
and his own experimental band Souvenir's Young America. His live shows
and gallery instillations include a variety of self-made sets,
collected props, and hidden lights. In 2009, he has 3 new releases: a
live collaboration EP with Svarte Greiner, "The Bending Of A Light" LP
with Jasper TX, and a new full length titled "Abandoned In Sleep," all
of which are on SMTG Limited.

Jeremy Bible & Jason Henry
|| Ohio || http://jbjh.experimedia.net || Infraction, Gruenrekorder,
Experimedia, Abgurd, Gears of Sand, Resting Bell, Smallfish, Audiobulb
Sound artists Jeremy Bible & Jason Henry collaborate to fuse elements
of musique concrete, acoustic, and electronic music. By means of
conceptual, experimental, and algorithmic recording and processing
techniques the duo seek to expose a synergetic relationship between
real world found sounds, acoustic instrumentation, and electronic
sound design. The duo's creative amalgamation of these elements have
created a moody and growing body of sound works.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...

Sat Jul 18                         HORIZON                       Pittsburgh

We are bringing some people out of the woodwork for this little baby. 
We've got a little bit of everything to hopefully please every single 
one of you! All these performers will have you dancing from the moment 
the sun disappears until the break of dawn.

Walkingstick - Jungle/reggae jungle/hip-hop [San Fransisco, CA] Five 
years after leaving the 'Burgh for San Francisco... After hundreds of 
thousands of air miles logged... Walkingstick makes his return!

>From 1998 to about 2005 Walkingstick was a very common name to see on a 
flyer in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland region. He was known for his oldskool, 
sample heavy, jungle style, often mixing in hip hop or various tracks 
from around the globe, anything to make it fun for the audience. He was 
also one of the founders of Total Xperience Productions, known for 
throwing memorable events such as NO DOZE, HUMBLE, ICEBURGH, GIFTED, 
HOMEGROWN and many more.

Throughout the years, Walkingstick not only played all throughout the 
USA but has also made numerous tours to Brazil, played shows in Puerto 
Rico, Scotland, etc..

After moving to San Francisco, Walkingstick has lead a much more low-key 
lifestyle, trading the flashing hypnotic lights of clubs and raves for 
staying home and producing his own tracks. Walkingstick has released one 
vinyl record every year for the past 5 years, one release on Jungle 
Riddim Records and four on his own label, Walkingstick World Records. 
All releases on his label have featured various artists and genres from 
around the globe, including artists from Russia, Switzerland and the 
most well-known name in baile funk, Mr. Catra, from Brazil.

So, after 5 years, Walkingstick comes to the 'Burgh, like straight out 
of a time machine to make a very rare performance featuring loads of 
Walkingstick original dubplates and other sounds you've never heard but 
also some classics that will surely keep you moving! Get ready for some 
junglist, dubplate business!!!
WA-WA-WA-WA-WALKINGSTICK!!!!!!!!

Ben Matrix - Drum and Bass
[Miami, FL]
He is making his return to Pittsburgh all the way from Miami to deliver 
a drum and bass set you are not soon to forget!!

Marty Mcfly - The funkiest breaks you've ever heard [Toronto, Canada] A 
long time ago... In a Delorean far far away.. MartyMcFly started mixing 
breakbeats. He got his start back in 1992 in Western Canada before 
cruisin' over to Toronto in 1995. He.s been mixing da Breaks across 
North America  ever since. His last visit to Pittsburgh was back in 
2007. Marty.s a huge breaker at heart and total mixologist behind the 
decks. His love and enthusiasm for music makes for a shit load of fun 
out on the dance floor.. Calling out all fun funky breakers for this 
one!!!

Venom - Hardcore/ass shaking booty house/hard house [Rumford, RI] Here 
he is, making his annual visit to the burgh. His award winning 
scratching and floorfilling track selection has made him a fan favorite. 
He has produced and released a countless number of tracks and complete 
mixes. So here comes the teacher to school you with some booty shaking 
sounds!!

DJ Meghan - Psytrance/downtempo
[Cleveland]
Considered one of the regions best psytrance and downtempo DJs, Meghan's 
DJ sets always deliver. Every beat will take you to distant places, 
making you feel exquisitely good. Don't miss out on this leading 
psytrance lady!!

Shawn Rudiman (Live) - Sexy Techno
[Pittsburgh]
This is a man who needs little introduction. He is truely a consummate 
artist, he prefers to play without the use of computers or software.
he chooses to conduct his sets like a jazz band would: letting every 
machine flow like performers and have their particular freedoms and 
moment to shine.  over 90% of all composition are composed there on the 
spot, for him and the audience to experience together for the first 
time.

Joltz - Hardcore/hardcore breaks/scratching [Pittsburgh] This guy might 
just be Pittsburgh's best kept hardcore secret!! Come check him out so 
he can blow you away.

DJ Kip Collins - Progressive/Trance
Pittsburgh

In addition to the lineup we have some special plans for the production 
including intense lights and lasers, mindboggling visuals, unique decor, 
cryogenic effects to keep the dancefloor frosty even on the hottest of 
summer nights and of course massive soundsystems that will let you feel 
every beat.

All Ages so everyone can enjoy this special night!!

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Walkingstick - Jungle/reggae jungle/hip-hop [San Fransisco, CA] Five 
years after leaving the 'Burgh for San Francisco... After hundreds of 
thousands of air miles logged... Walkingstick makes his return!

>From 1998 to about 2005 Walkingstick was a very common name to see on a 
flyer in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland region. He was known for his oldskool, 
sample heavy, jungle style, often mixing in hip hop or various tracks 
from around the globe, anything to make it fun for the audience. He was 
also one of the founders of Total Xperience Productions, known for 
throwing memorable events such as NO DOZE, HUMBLE, ICEBURGH, GIFTED, 
HOMEGROWN and many more.

Throughout the years, Walkingstick not only played all throughout the 
USA but has also made numerous tours to Brazil, played shows in Puerto 
Rico, Scotland, etc..

After moving to San Francisco, Walkingstick has lead a much more low-key 
lifestyle, trading the flashing hypnotic lights of clubs and raves for 
staying home and producing his own tracks. Walkingstick has released one 
vinyl record every year for the past 5 years, one release on Jungle 
Riddim Records and four on his own label, Walkingstick World Records. 
All releases on his label have featured various artists and genres from 
around the globe, including artists from Russia, Switzerland and the 
most well-known name in baile funk, Mr. Catra, from Brazil.

7UP (Steel City Funk)
Pittsburgh PA

For longer then many can remember, the name 7up has been synonymous with 
the house scene dropping his unique mixing style at hundreds of events 
and every major nightclub in Pittsburgh and major cities around the 
States. Over Dave.s history he has brought many new styles of house to 
Pittsburgh including Speed Garage in 1997, to the short but sweet 2-Step 
trend that came and went with the millennium, right up the present 
incarnations of deep and funky house which he rocks on the dancefloor, 
leaving a trail of satisfied party goers in his path. As anyone will 
attest to, Dave.s performances are nothing short of AMAZING and filled 
with positive energy which is translated to the people who come to see 
him play. Armed with the latest in music production technology and the 
finest collaborators, Dave Sanchez continues to work on dance floor 
rocking tracks always with the goal of pushing the limits of house.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Jul 18                         HORIZON                       Pittsburgh

We are bringing some people out of the woodwork for this little baby. 
We've got a little bit of everything to hopefully please every single 
one of you! All these performers will have you dancing from the moment 
the sun disappears until the break of dawn.

Walkingstick - Jungle/reggae jungle/hip-hop [San Fransisco, CA] Five 
years after leaving the 'Burgh for San Francisco... After hundreds of 
thousands of air miles logged... Walkingstick makes his return!

>From 1998 to about 2005 Walkingstick was a very common name to see on a 
flyer in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland region. He was known for his oldskool, 
sample heavy, jungle style, often mixing in hip hop or various tracks 
from around the globe, anything to make it fun for the audience. He was 
also one of the founders of Total Xperience Productions, known for 
throwing memorable events such as NO DOZE, HUMBLE, ICEBURGH, GIFTED, 
HOMEGROWN and many more.

Throughout the years, Walkingstick not only played all throughout the 
USA but has also made numerous tours to Brazil, played shows in Puerto 
Rico, Scotland, etc..

After moving to San Francisco, Walkingstick has lead a much more low-key 
lifestyle, trading the flashing hypnotic lights of clubs and raves for 
staying home and producing his own tracks. Walkingstick has released one 
vinyl record every year for the past 5 years, one release on Jungle 
Riddim Records and four on his own label, Walkingstick World Records. 
All releases on his label have featured various artists and genres from 
around the globe, including artists from Russia, Switzerland and the 
most well-known name in baile funk, Mr. Catra, from Brazil.

So, after 5 years, Walkingstick comes to the 'Burgh, like straight out 
of a time machine to make a very rare performance featuring loads of 
Walkingstick original dubplates and other sounds you've never heard but 
also some classics that will surely keep you moving! Get ready for some 
junglist, dubplate business!!!
WA-WA-WA-WA-WALKINGSTICK!!!!!!!!

long time ago... In a Delorean far far away.. MartyMcFly started mixing

cruisin' over to Toronto in 1995. He.s been mixing da Breaks across 
North America  ever since. His last visit to Pittsburgh was back in 
2007. Marty.s a huge breaker at heart and total mixologist behind the 
decks. His love and enthusiasm for music makes for a shit load of fun 
out on the dance floor.. Calling out all fun funky breakers for this 
one!!!

Venom - Hardcore/ass shaking booty house/hard house [Rumford, RI] Here 
he is, making his annual visit to the burgh. His award winning

mixes. So here comes the teacher to school you with some booty shaking 
sounds!!

psytrance lady!!

Shawn Rudiman (Live) - Sexy Techno
[Pittsburgh]
This is a man who needs little introduction. He is truely a consummate 
artist, he prefers to play without the use of computers or software.
he chooses to conduct his sets like a jazz band would: letting every 
machine flow like performers and have their particular freedoms and 
moment to shine.  over 90% of all composition are composed there on the 
spot, for him and the audience to experience together for the first 
time.

just be Pittsburgh's best kept hardcore secret!! Come check him out so
