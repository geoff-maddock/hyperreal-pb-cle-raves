Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

of music. So if you don't already own a 5.1. Surround system maybe now's
the time to get one (if you like watching movies on DVD ths is maybe a good
idea anyway)... We are sorry this will not be available in another more
'standard' format, but this extraordinary work just won't fit on 2 standard
CD's AND is intended to be listened to - in its full glory - like this.
Due to the special nature of the format this title will come in a limited
edition of 1000 copies.

Yeah...crossing my fingers it will be well executed.  I think it will
be considering its a collaborative effort between two of the worlds
most innovative electronic music technology groups...Autechre and
Hafler Trio.

Subject: {pb-cle} BT & Autechre : (was 5.1 or 7.1 "electronica"?)

was asked "if you could have at anyone's studio in the world who's
would it be."  To my surprise his answer was "autechre...hands down".

done by the same guy:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHyfN5qsUW0

a short movie that's pretty funny.

Also somehow related to all this I stumbled accross some demo videos.
Best one is 'state of the art' that played on the amiga. May not be as
impressive for those that never used an amiga or even that sense of time
(late 80's early 90's) just awesome this demo is.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5kuYfTCGLg

About all I can gather as to how it was done is it's all vector art.
btw that whole video was stored on a single 880 kb floppy disk.  As a
side note, I liked the first few seconds of the music that I turned it
into a ringtone for phone :)

lol... I dont know, I need both!!! I am still using a laptop running windows me... lmao, and my desktop is first generation XP. They both work, but are pretty close to being taken out behind the shed 'Old Yeller' style.

Lemme rephrase this - which of these 3 do you guys think is the BEST DEAL???

well then most laptops i've dealt with have an external monitor jack.  
modern ones you can run the external as an extended desktop (you'd be 
using both screens)

just get a beefy laptop and unhook when you need to go portable

or get one of those frickin 18" monstrosities that companies dare call a 
laptop.  whos lap?  andre the giant?
some ppl call them desktop replacements.

I have a laptop hooked to an external monitor for over a year and have never
even opened it to use the laptop's screen and keyboard besides a couple
times when I first got it. Get a laptop, monitor, keyboard and mouse. I have
a spider web of USB peripherals plugged in as well. I bet I haven't had this
laptop turned off more than 24 hrs in a year. Its always on. It still runs
like the first day I got it but I fear a fan or something is going wear out
eventualy. I dunno how hard it will be to change a laptop fan if its even
possible.

I believe your best 'value per dollar bargain' is on Tim Hayes'
underpants or buying a mac.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Detroit Techno Militia is a record label and a grass roots DJ/Producer 
collective dedicated to preserving the legacy of true Detroit electronic 
music and its proliferation around the world.

Similar to the restoration of historic architecture; we are not tearing 
down and building anew. Rather using the existing structure as a basis 
for our own endeavors. Detroit has always had much to offer musically 
and it is our mission to make it known to the rest of the world for 
generations to come.

As owner and co-founder of Bang Tech 12, DJ Seoul has been tearing up 
the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule that 
has taken him to literally thousands of events across North America. 
Including the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, which he considers a 
career highlight.

2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip

Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."


JOHN CARPENTER
www.myspace.com/joncarpenter
www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

By Summer 2004, Jon Carpenter found himself in a new setting altogether. 
He and his wife moved to South Korea to spend a year abroad and to see a 
new part of the world. The notion of the frontier theory was forged 
years ago with the idea "Go West Youngman." In the land of the morning 
calm, without any reservations he walked up to one of Seoul.s premiere 
promoters and handed him his demo. As they say "the rest is history!" 
His unselfish nature towards his dance floor has inspired his peers and 
has left clubbers in Korea exhausted after his sets. House music was 
still his main forte' dropping tracks from label's such as Fine Tune, 
Work, Data, Boss, Subliminal, IHR, Slip n Slide, and EyezCream. His days 
of spinning in his home state Pennsylvania are a distant memory, but 
taught him valuable skills that gained him bookings in some of Seoul's 
largest nightclubs.

The year in South Korea extended a few extra months, until moving to 
Belgium in February 2006. Currently in Belgium, with a new cd release 
coming soon, a new online radio show, and beginning the early stages of 
his own production, the future is looking bright. Jon Carpenter is 
reaching his third continent, and he's only getting started. His track 
selection, smooth mixing, and ability to rock the dance floor has become 
popular with clubbers and is quickly gaining more support.


WALTER WORDSWORTH

close friends at the time had done a few parties in the area, from there 
on out his passion for the music and djing has grown. In 1998 he got his 
hands on some 1200s and never looked back. With 9 years under his belt, 
he has played in Pittsburgh, Philly. DC, Detroit, Bufflo, NewYork City &

I just got suckered into joining this. It seemed like a good idea since
I'm at work and I'm putting off doing something I really should be doing

I've used this email address. Okay, bye.

I wish there was a way to block content-free applications.  Like  
Mobwars.  :-)

Nah, that's what Myspace is for. There, I made friends with 500 strangers
just to have them in my Mobsters mob. Lame. That's pretty much all I do on
Myspace these days - play Mobsters. I would imagine it must be similar to
Mob Wars on Facebook. I think I'm gonna stay away from the apps there,
though.

Tons of people from my high school are finding me on facebook and it's
kinda weird.

Some of the apps on Facebook add content, instead of being MEEE TOO!  
type things.

Linking in Twitter, a blog, and photos are kind of nice.  Flickr,  
Last.Fm, etc.

Dunno.  Content is good.

Subject: {pb-cle} Experimedia DJ set at Annabell's in Akron tonight 11:30

Kind of last minute but I will be djing a set of experimental dance
music (lots of Raster-Noton type stuff) at Tek-Know?'s weekly
(re)vision at Annabell's in Akron tonight (Wednesday) at 11:30pm.  Its
going to be loud, hard, rumbling, and glitchy.  (my acoustic pads in
my studio were falling off the wall from the bass while I was
preparing last night).

Come check out the sounds coming from Berlin label Raster-Noton during
my set as we may be bringing them to the area in June.

10:00-11:30 _ 1 Auxy (minimal techno / house) Tek-know?
11:30-12:30 _ *special set from* Jeremy Bible (Raster Beats) Experimedia
12:30-1:30 _ N:Coder (Koala Tea/Konkrete Jungle)

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

LOCKED DOWN ENT. AND HIJACKED RECORDS PRESENTS

REBEL ALLIANCE

WITH PERFORMANCES BY:


TWONZ aka THE TECHNO TERRORIST
HIJACKED RECORDS DETROITTECHNO  

Twonz  aka "the Techno TERRORIST of Detroit" (born Antwon Faulkner 1971) 
is the prototype of the modern DJ. Growing up in the church, playing 
music and dancing through his childhood in Detroit, he found his passion 
for music early. In his late teens he discovered a new religion...a 
religion created and perpetuated in the predominately black urban 
wasteland of Detroit, Michigan...Techno. It was a religion to which he 
has become an evangelist and devoted his life to. Growing up in the 
heart of Detroit allowed him to see first hand the early development of 
artists like Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Claude Young, 
Jeff Mills, .Mad. Mike Banks and other famous luminaries of Detroit.


RONIN SELECTA w/ TEDDY MC
BASSDRIVE/HYDRODRUM & BASS

In 1995, Ronin Selecta was introduced to Jungle. From that moment, he 
has taken this genre of music to the limits. Performing at full scale 
events, parties and night clubs from coast to coast including Groovetech 
in San Francisco to CBGB's in New York as well as holding down many 
residencies over the years including the Labyrynth, Motor Lounge, Tonic, 
The Magic Stick and the longest running D & B night in Michigan which 
was "Breakbeat Etiquette" at the Carbon Lounge. In 2005, Ronin started a 
new Residency at the Necto in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This was the 
legendary Hydro night that ended in August of 2007.


DARKCUBE vs.THE DISCIPLE
DETROIT TECHNO MILITIADRUM & BASSHIJACKED RECORDSDRUM & BASS
DARKCUBE notorious for his darkside jungle sets as well as his ability 
to dynamically span a broad spectrum of techno and electro, DARKCUBE's 
got quite the rep in both Detroit and the San Francisco bay area. He's 
held residencies in both cities, year after year, and played his share 
of underground warehouse events. DARKCUBE's been repping Detroit 
alongside international headliners since 1999, all across North America. 
No matter if he's playing straight up Detroit techno, electro, jungle, 
or breakcore, DARKCUBE will mix and blend with a force to be reckoned 
with.
THE DISCIPLE has been making music for over a decade starting with 
guitar when he was 13 in 1994, he has been MCing and Producing since 
1997, and DJing since 2000.  His set are filled with mix after mix of 
hard, dark, energetic tracks, combinded with progressive transitions. Be 
ready for 2hrs of intense drum and bass mayhem as two masters of 
darkness square off head to head... let the crowd decide!


MARK MOSS aka 8EN
BANGTECH 12OLDSKOOL JUNGLE/HARDCORE
Mark Moss aka 8en was raised outside of St Louis and started DJing Acid 
House around '88-'89. He eventually moved onto Hardcore/Breakbeat in 
'91, and then into Hardcore/Jungle where he currently reside in styles. 
In 1992 he moved to Detroit and started going to parties and honing his 
DJing skills. He then took a six year hiatus from Detroit, eventually 
moved back, and started DJing again with a focus on bringing back the 
oldskool sound and feel of Jungle and Hardcore. Yes, Mark Moss aka 8en 
is the Original Detroit Junglist, wanna test?

managers collaborate to create one of Michigan.s most unique and 
unconventional club nights. Joe has also held a Drum and Bass weekly 
residency at The Grand Café in Farmington that lasted the better part of

has been consistently working on his production and live p.a. act, as 
well as working with Brian Scott revamping the project known as Red Pill

bumpin', be sure to be in attendance when Gusto drops one of the dopest 
techno live p.a. sets you've seen yet, HANDS DOWN.

Inner Child presents

HOLIDAZE:2008
featuring:

CHUCK LOVE
(Salted Music, Om Records / Minneapolis, MN)
Premiere Pittsburgh Appearance!

LIVE PERFORMANCE!

@ z:lounge (upstairs)
Friday, December 26 | 9pm-2am

San Francisco based D.J. and recording artist (for the Labels Salted 
Music and Om Records), Chuck Love originally hailed from the Minneapolis 
area. His album Bring Enough to Spill Some was released in June of 2007 
and featured several successful dance singles, including "Spread the 
Love", "Soul Symphony", and the romantic "Something Right".  Love is not 
a typical house music maker . the man plays all his own instruments. 
When his contemporaries in his house-lovin' home-base of Minneapolis 
expressed their love of the beat through DJ sets, Love would happily 
back them on trumpet, guitar, or really anything else he could find. 
Love says he's found a really good fit to do what he does from the DJ 
box, presenting his production as well as live solos with instruments, 
vocals, and live visuals making the show just a little different from 
what house-heads usually see from their DJs.

"Chuck Love has inspired fans, DJ's and producers alike with his kinetic 
soulful production and musical live show." . BILLBOARD

DETROIT TECHNO MILITIA
2x4 DJ Seoul & T.Linder
[www.detroittechnomilitia.com]
-2008 Rustbelt Tour-

Detroit Techno Militia is a record label and a grass roots DJ/Producer 
collective dedicated to preserving the legacy of true Detroit electronic 
music and its proliferation around the world.

Similar to the restoration of historic architecture; we are not tearing 
down and building anew. Rather using the existing structure as a basis 
for our own endeavors. Detroit has always had much to offer musically 
and it is our mission to make it known to the rest of the world for 
generations to come.

As owner and co-founder of Bang Tech 12, DJ Seoul has been tearing up 
the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule that 
has taken him to literally thousands of events across North America. 
Including the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, which he considers a 
career highlight.

Candy Mountain: By Ways of the Shoe Shoe Train

January 31, 2009
 
2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip
Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."
 

JOHN CARPENTER
www.myspace.com/joncarpenter
www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

close friends at the time had done a few parties in the area, from there

he has played in Pittsburgh, Philly. DC, Detroit, Bufflo, NewYork City &

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

More details coming soon.

mental health consumer
the measurement spoils the data

Scientist and artist Brian Ruskin (aka Mental Health Consumer) seeks
to achieve the careful balance between the calculated and emotive,
well-crafted music that also resonates with the listener. His new EP,
The Measurement Spoils the Data is inspired by the differences between
spring and autumn.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

REBEL ALLIANCE

WITH PERFORMANCES BY:


TWONZ aka THE TECHNO TERRORIST
HIJACKED RECORDS DETROITTECHNO  

Twonz  aka "the Techno TERRORIST of Detroit" (born Antwon Faulkner 1971) 
is the prototype of the modern DJ. Growing up in the church, playing 
music and dancing through his childhood in Detroit, he found his passion 
for music early. In his late teens he discovered a new religion...a 
religion created and perpetuated in the predominately black urban 
wasteland of Detroit, Michigan...Techno. It was a religion to which he 
has become an evangelist and devoted his life to. Growing up in the 
heart of Detroit allowed him to see first hand the early development of 
artists like Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Claude Young, 
Jeff Mills, .Mad. Mike Banks and other famous luminaries of Detroit.


RONIN SELECTA w/ TEDDY MC
BASSDRIVE/HYDRODRUM & BASS

In 1995, Ronin Selecta was introduced to Jungle. From that moment, he 
has taken this genre of music to the limits. Performing at full scale 
events, parties and night clubs from coast to coast including Groovetech 
in San Francisco to CBGB's in New York as well as holding down many 
residencies over the years including the Labyrynth, Motor Lounge, Tonic, 
The Magic Stick and the longest running D & B night in Michigan which 
was "Breakbeat Etiquette" at the Carbon Lounge. In 2005, Ronin started a 
new Residency at the Necto in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This was the 
legendary Hydro night that ended in August of 2007.


DARKCUBE vs.THE DISCIPLE
DETROIT TECHNO MILITIADRUM & BASSHIJACKED RECORDSDRUM & BASS
DARKCUBE notorious for his darkside jungle sets as well as his ability 
to dynamically span a broad spectrum of techno and electro, DARKCUBE's 
got quite the rep in both Detroit and the San Francisco bay area. He's 
held residencies in both cities, year after year, and played his share 
of underground warehouse events. DARKCUBE's been repping Detroit 
alongside international headliners since 1999, all across North America. 
No matter if he's playing straight up Detroit techno, electro, jungle, 
or breakcore, DARKCUBE will mix and blend with a force to be reckoned 
with.
THE DISCIPLE has been making music for over a decade starting with 
guitar when he was 13 in 1994, he has been MCing and Producing since 
1997, and DJing since 2000.  His set are filled with mix after mix of 
hard, dark, energetic tracks, combinded with progressive transitions. Be 
ready for 2hrs of intense drum and bass mayhem as two masters of 
darkness square off head to head... let the crowd decide!


MARK MOSS aka 8EN
BANGTECH 12OLDSKOOL JUNGLE/HARDCORE
Mark Moss aka 8en was raised outside of St Louis and started DJing Acid 
House around '88-'89. He eventually moved onto Hardcore/Breakbeat in 
'91, and then into Hardcore/Jungle where he currently reside in styles. 
In 1992 he moved to Detroit and started going to parties and honing his 
DJing skills. He then took a six year hiatus from Detroit, eventually 
moved back, and started DJing again with a focus on bringing back the 
oldskool sound and feel of Jungle and Hardcore. Yes, Mark Moss aka 8en 
is the Original Detroit Junglist, wanna test?

has been consistently working on his production and live p.a. act, as 
well as working with Brian Scott revamping the project known as Red Pill

bumpin', be sure to be in attendance when Gusto drops one of the dopest 
techno live p.a. sets you've seen yet, HANDS DOWN.

Inner Child presents

HOLIDAZE:2008
featuring:

CHUCK LOVE
(Salted Music, Om Records / Minneapolis, MN)
Premiere Pittsburgh Appearance!

LIVE PERFORMANCE!

@ z:lounge (upstairs)
Friday, December 26 | 9pm-2am

San Francisco based D.J. and recording artist (for the Labels Salted 
Music and Om Records), Chuck Love originally hailed from the Minneapolis 
area. His album Bring Enough to Spill Some was released in June of 2007 
and featured several successful dance singles, including "Spread the 
Love", "Soul Symphony", and the romantic "Something Right".  Love is not 
a typical house music maker . the man plays all his own instruments. 
When his contemporaries in his house-lovin' home-base of Minneapolis 
expressed their love of the beat through DJ sets, Love would happily 
back them on trumpet, guitar, or really anything else he could find. 
Love says he's found a really good fit to do what he does from the DJ 
box, presenting his production as well as live solos with instruments, 
vocals, and live visuals making the show just a little different from 
what house-heads usually see from their DJs.

"Chuck Love has inspired fans, DJ's and producers alike with his kinetic 
soulful production and musical live show." . BILLBOARD

Detroit Techno Militia is a record label and a grass roots DJ/Producer 
collective dedicated to preserving the legacy of true Detroit electronic 
music and its proliferation around the world.

Similar to the restoration of historic architecture; we are not tearing 
down and building anew. Rather using the existing structure as a basis 
for our own endeavors. Detroit has always had much to offer musically 
and it is our mission to make it known to the rest of the world for 
generations to come.

As owner and co-founder of Bang Tech 12, DJ Seoul has been tearing up 
the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule that 
has taken him to literally thousands of events across North America. 
Including the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, which he considers a 
career highlight.

R.M.S.F.F presents:

Candy Mountain: By Ways of the Shoe Shoe Train

January 31, 2009
 
2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip
Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."
 

JOHN CARPENTER
www.myspace.com/joncarpenter
www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

close friends at the time had done a few parties in the area, from there

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.
www.myspace.com/kiriyamamusic

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

$15 door

More details coming soon.
Stay tuned

presented across the greater Miami area during WMC week. Founded in 1985 
as a platform for the advancement of the music industry, the WMC program 
includes seminars, meetings, receptions and parties throughout the week 
with personalities and innovators from all aspects of the business 
worldwide. Q&As and technical hardware/software demonstrations will be 
highlighted each day. Last year's program featured 227 panelists and 
speakers participating in more than 80 meetings, seminars, workshops and 
demonstrations. Overall more than 62,000 participants and 3,726 
delegates from 70 countries attended, making it the largest industry 
program of its kind in the world. Expect an even larger turn out for 
2009.

Highlights of the 2009 program will include the IDMA's (International 
Dance Music Awards), also in it.s 24th consecutive year, where the music 
business converges to honor the achievements of industry, artists and 
innovators in 50 categories. Voting will begin in November.

WMC will also present the 2nd edition of South Beach Sessions, a bold 
new perspective on the traditional WMC panel program. Founded on the 
principles that make music compelling . individual expression, 
empowerment, creative thinking and collaboration . the program.s mission 
is to create greater exposure for artists and ideas. South Beach 
Sessions explores new inroads where music and art are flourishing and 
making a courageous difference in the world. Pioneers in music, art, 
fashion, technology, business, education, the environment and more 
convene for one of the most inspiring and epic programs of the week.

WMC 2009 will host the 3rd edition of the Record Collector's Show - an

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Dec 26                        HOLIDAZE                       Pittsburgh

Inner Child presents

HOLIDAZE:2008
featuring:

CHUCK LOVE
(Salted Music, Om Records / Minneapolis, MN)
Premiere Pittsburgh Appearance!

LIVE PERFORMANCE!

@ z:lounge (upstairs)
Friday, December 26 | 9pm-2am

San Francisco based D.J. and recording artist (for the Labels Salted 
Music and Om Records), Chuck Love originally hailed from the Minneapolis 
area. His album Bring Enough to Spill Some was released in June of 2007 
and featured several successful dance singles, including "Spread the 
Love", "Soul Symphony", and the romantic "Something Right".  Love is not 
a typical house music maker . the man plays all his own instruments. 
When his contemporaries in his house-lovin' home-base of Minneapolis 
expressed their love of the beat through DJ sets, Love would happily 
back them on trumpet, guitar, or really anything else he could find. 
Love says he's found a really good fit to do what he does from the DJ 
box, presenting his production as well as live solos with instruments, 
vocals, and live visuals making the show just a little different from 
what house-heads usually see from their DJs.

"Chuck Love has inspired fans, DJ's and producers alike with his kinetic 
soulful production and musical live show." . BILLBOARD

Also featuring:
ELYSIUM
(House / Inner Child, Steel City Funk)

BILLY WEGS

Detroit Techno Militia is a record label and a grass roots DJ/Producer 
collective dedicated to preserving the legacy of true Detroit electronic 
music and its proliferation around the world.

Similar to the restoration of historic architecture; we are not tearing

for our own endeavors. Detroit has always had much to offer musically 
and it is our mission to make it known to the rest of the world for 
generations to come.

As owner and co-founder of Bang Tech 12, DJ Seoul has been tearing up 
the Detroit Techno scene for 11 years. Playing a wide assortment of 
music, from electro to hip hop to rare groove to house to minimal, DJ 
Seoul is known for bringing a turntablist hip hop style of mixing to his 
set no matter what genre he is playing.

DJ Seoul has played from coast to coast in the states as well as parts 
of Canada as well. He has held countless residencies during his years of 
djing.

T. Linder is a veteran DJ with more than ten years of experience under 
his belt; A Detroit native, he has done his homework and paid his dues.

Over the past decade, T.Linder has kept a busy performance schedule that 
has taken him to literally thousands of events across North America. 
Including the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, which he considers a 
career highlight.

R.M.S.F.F presents:

Candy Mountain: By Ways of the Shoe Shoe Train

January 31, 2009
 
2RIP
House/Techno/Electro
www.myspace.com/2rip
Record Label: Infamous Light Records

DJ 2rip is known for energetic performances as well as a level of 
showmanship that exceeds most dj's in the circuit. He has shared the 
stage with the world's greatest dj's and continues to make his mark 
through edgy, upfront music that infuses dancers with the energy to go 
until the last record plays out.

Within a decade of dj'ing, 2rip has managed production companies in 
three regions and sustained a nation-wide tour schedule, playing events 
like Spundae by TruNightlife and Buzz at Nation Nightclub. He also hosts 
The District Sound Session every Monday night at www.afterhoursdjs.org 
and continues to hold the most widely publicized show on the channel, 
reaching listeners in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Musically his sounds range from minimal to techno, banging progressive & 
electro. In more underground locations 2rip is prominently known as a 
breaks dj - playing hard, funky rhythms combined with the use of analog 
acid melodies. If asked to describe himself, 2rip would say "I am one of 
the most versatile dj.s I know because I like everything and don.t see 
dj.ing as segmented by genre or sound. My goal is to take a crowd on a 
journey that I compose while playing music that they want to hear."
 

JOHN CARPENTER
www.myspace.com/joncarpenter
www.funkymonday.com

At an early age, Jon Carpenter was actively involved in music. When he 
was just 6 years old he took lessons in Piano from his Grandmother that 
taught him the basic fundamentals of all written music. By Elementary 
School, he started early into the band, and as time passed he eventually 
moved into local, and regional bands and orchestra's. During his 
mid-teens he was introduced by a friend to basic djing for Homecomings, 
Proms and even a wedding here or there. By the tender age of 17 he was 
introduced to the Rave scene in the Baltimore/DC area. Frequenting 
various clubs such as the Paradox (Fever), Nation (Buzz) and events like 
Starscape (UltraWorld), he became hooked on house music.

At this time he decided that it was time to settle in and focus on 
Djing. He bought his first set of decks and after a few months of 
practice started a weekly on-line radio show. Through this outlet of 
streaming to people all over the world, he came in contact with Dj 2rip 
who joined him and started the weekly "Wednesday Night Mayhem" on 
orbitalgroovesradio.com. The show quickly turned into a studio party in 
downtown State College, and they decided that it was time to start a 
weekly clubnight. "Wednesday Night Mayhem" eventually turned into 
"Release," one of central Pennsylvania's most succesful weekly parties.

Release hosted Dj's from all over Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and New 
York as well as helped join together local talent. Release became the 
focal point of various Rave's and Events in Central PA. It also helped 
Dj Jon Carpenter refine his mixing style and gain experience as a 
promoter.

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.
www.myspace.com/kiriyamamusic

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

$15 door

More details coming soon.
Stay tuned

Subject: {pb-cle} [PIT] Tomorrow - 8th Annual Humanaut Chinatown Inn NYE - 12.31.08 

December 31st, 2008

For eight years, Pittsburghers and many others from across multiple states
have made this party their destination on New Year's Eve. Why? It's like
no other party around.

Take the freshest cutting-edge techno, house and breaks DJs, spread them
across two floors, add one of the best sound systems heard in Pittsburgh
and throw in a packed house that's ready to get down. That's the formula
that's been used since the beginning, and once you see it in action you
will quickly realize why this is one of Pittsburgh's most legendary
parties year after year.

Welcome the advent of 2009 with open arms, open ears, and friendly peers.

Third Floor
For The Love (7up & Anthony Fugate Live PA)
DVS & Eryn Evans

Doors open @ 9pm
Must be 21 to enter
