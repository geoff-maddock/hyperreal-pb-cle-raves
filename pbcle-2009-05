Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm

http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat May 09                      FOREVER YOUNG                       Toronto

The magic. The mystery. The music. There's nothing quite like raving. 
Every time you walk in the door, you're transported to a timeless land 
of peace, love, unity and respect; a place where the beat never stops 
and the wonders never cease; home away from home. You know how amazing 
it feels.

So do we.

We remember our first glimpse into the magical world that is raving. We 
remember the bracelets, the smiles, the hugs, the lasers, the music. And 
even though we've grown older, so long as we have raving in our lives, 
we never have to grow up.

On May 9th, join Nocturnal Commissions as we celebrate the wonder and 
magic of all things rave. Get out your brightest bracelets and your fun 
fur pants; bring along your old half-filled PLUR book; buy a new Vicks 
inhaler and a pair of glowsticks.

We are bright.

We are happy.

We are loving.

We are Toronto's Happy Hardcore ravers, and we are...

FOREVER YOUNG!

Featuring...

::Charles Feelgood::
Supacutz, myspace.com/charlesfeelgoodmusic
//funky shit-hard house-techno-electro
Legendary for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore/Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood has built a reputation as 
a DJ in the international dance community through his ingenious remix 
skills and a dynamic brand of funky disco and hard house.

The consummated dance floor rocker, Feelgood sums up his musical mission 
in one sentence: "I just want to do what the name implies, to make 
people have a good time and go home with a great feeling."

He is sure to have you grinning from ear to ear so much it will make 
your face hurt. There is almost no way to stand still while this man is 
on the decks. His tunes will definitely have you feeling good (if not 
super awesome) the whole entire time.


::ramz::
District Ignition / Washington DC (First Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
//minimal-house-trace-and more...
Back in the days of the dinosaurs a caveman found music by beating two 
rocks together. After a major ice storm the caveman was frozen and his 
body was found in a glacier in the mountains. He was then taken to 
Washington, DC where he was left to thaw.

After regaining consciousness he learned to speak English and was given 
a name . Jason Ramsey. Jason soon drew musical inspiration from a very 
eclectic set of artists. Near the height of the nineties, he drew from 
this inspiration to establish himself as a dj in Washington, DC, taking 
on the moniker of .ramz..

More recently, Jason has developed his musical tastes from the tribal 
and progressive he was known for in the years of Buzz to a more refined 
taste which revolves around a combination of minimal, Swedish house and 
a small taste of trance when it's necessary. Jason has not only been 
invited to open the stage for dj's such as Gabriel & Dresden, George 
Acosta & BT but his mix series "Aural Fixation" has been in high demand 
across the country. That's a pretty good resume for a displaced 
homo-sapien from the Paleolithic era.

::DJ 2Rip::
District Ignition / Washington DC
//anything and everything
Some people filter through the music, purchasing music that is 
acceptable because everyone else is listening to it or because .it.s 
hot.. Then there are people who dig deep to find unique music that isn.t 
necessarily being sustained by pop culture. There are the people who 
absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking trends . forever on 
a quest to find the perfect record. DJ 2rip falls into the latter 
category.

He has made his mark over the course of a decade by hosting events 
around the mid-Atlantic, including abandoned apartment buildings and 
warehouse lofts to superclubs like Ibiza and Fur. With many ups and 
downs throughout his career his music has always been edgy and upfront. 
With that notion constantly in mind, DJ 2rip also maintains an ability 
to span several genres to create a unique musical journey.

He will fill your dancing shoes with pure awesomeness!!

::The Breakbeat Militia::
3x4 Clevr X Moose X Zone
breakbeatmilitia.com, Nexnap, djmoose.com Pittsburgh/Cleveland
//uhh...Breaks?

The name is synonymous with breakbeat perfection.

They have been mixing records since some of us were still in diapers and 
have so much skill between the 3 of them they could just spontaneously 
combust at any moment when they are on the decks. So watch out!! Even if 
they don't catch on fire, the dancefloor surely will, so make sure you 
wear flame retardant shoes!

::Eryn Evans::
B.A.D. Ass, Sinister Movement
//Bassline
You know her, you love her, you want to have 1000 babies with her, but 
she won't let you. Oh well, at least she will come out and blow you away 
with her bassline madness. Prepare your minds/bodies/souls for this 
earth shaking performance.

::abZ::
savoryaudio.com, FUZZ!
//Dubstep
According to an article in Pittsburgh's CP from 2007, AbZ was credited

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

www.GMSF.us / www.Gaian-Mind.com / www.Ramblewood.com
NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...

7UP (Steel City Funk)
Pittsburgh PA

For longer then many can remember, the name 7up has been synonymous with 
the house scene dropping his unique mixing style at hundreds of events 
and every major nightclub in Pittsburgh and major cities around the 
States. Over Dave.s history he has brought many new styles of house to 
Pittsburgh including Speed Garage in 1997, to the short but sweet 2-Step 
trend that came and went with the millennium, right up the present 
incarnations of deep and funky house which he rocks on the dancefloor, 
leaving a trail of satisfied party goers in his path. As anyone will 
attest to, Dave.s performances are nothing short of AMAZING and filled 
with positive energy which is translated to the people who come to see 
him play. Armed with the latest in music production technology and the 
finest collaborators, Dave Sanchez continues to work on dance floor 
rocking tracks always with the goal of pushing the limits of house.

Aligning Minds!!! - Reality Tunnels
http://fluidblog.wordpress.com/2009/02/03/aligning-minds-reality-tunnels/

We are pleased to announce that the recent Aligning Minds mix =93Reality
Tunnels=94 has now been made available for download due to popular
demand. We heard about these guys early last year and have been
following them closely ever since. Blending IDM, mellow DnB fused with
layers of gentle ambience, I have a strong feeling Aligning Minds are
an act to watch out for in 2009

15 days and counting!!

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

::Charles Feelgood::
Supacutz, myspace.com/charlesfeelgoodmusic
//funky shit-hard house-techno-electro
Legendary for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore/Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood has built a reputation as 
a DJ in the international dance community through his ingenious remix 
skills and a dynamic brand of funky disco and hard house.

The consummated dance floor rocker, Feelgood sums up his musical mission 
in one sentence: "I just want to do what the name implies, to make 
people have a good time and go home with a great feeling."

He is sure to have you grinning from ear to ear so much it will make 
your face hurt. There is almost no way to stand still while this man is 
on the decks. His tunes will definitely have you feeling good (if not 
super awesome) the whole entire time.


::ramz::
District Ignition / Washington DC (First Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
//minimal-house-trace-and more...
Back in the days of the dinosaurs a caveman found music by beating two 
rocks together. After a major ice storm the caveman was frozen and his 
body was found in a glacier in the mountains. He was then taken to 
Washington, DC where he was left to thaw.

After regaining consciousness he learned to speak English and was given 
a name . Jason Ramsey. Jason soon drew musical inspiration from a very 
eclectic set of artists. Near the height of the nineties, he drew from 
this inspiration to establish himself as a dj in Washington, DC, taking 
on the moniker of .ramz..

More recently, Jason has developed his musical tastes from the tribal 
and progressive he was known for in the years of Buzz to a more refined 
taste which revolves around a combination of minimal, Swedish house and 
a small taste of trance when it's necessary. Jason has not only been 
invited to open the stage for dj's such as Gabriel & Dresden, George 
Acosta & BT but his mix series "Aural Fixation" has been in high demand 
across the country. That's a pretty good resume for a displaced 
homo-sapien from the Paleolithic era.

::DJ 2Rip::
District Ignition / Washington DC
//anything and everything
Some people filter through the music, purchasing music that is 
acceptable because everyone else is listening to it or because .it.s 
hot.. Then there are people who dig deep to find unique music that isn.t 
necessarily being sustained by pop culture. There are the people who 
absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking trends . forever on 
a quest to find the perfect record. DJ 2rip falls into the latter 
category.

He has made his mark over the course of a decade by hosting events 
around the mid-Atlantic, including abandoned apartment buildings and 
warehouse lofts to superclubs like Ibiza and Fur. With many ups and 
downs throughout his career his music has always been edgy and upfront. 
With that notion constantly in mind, DJ 2rip also maintains an ability 
to span several genres to create a unique musical journey.

He will fill your dancing shoes with pure awesomeness!!

::The Breakbeat Militia::
3x4 Clevr X Moose X Zone
breakbeatmilitia.com, Nexnap, djmoose.com Pittsburgh/Cleveland
//uhh...Breaks?

The name is synonymous with breakbeat perfection.

They have been mixing records since some of us were still in diapers and 
have so much skill between the 3 of them they could just spontaneously 
combust at any moment when they are on the decks. So watch out!! Even if 
they don't catch on fire, the dancefloor surely will, so make sure you 
wear flame retardant shoes!

::Eryn Evans::
B.A.D. Ass, Sinister Movement
//Bassline
You know her, you love her, you want to have 1000 babies with her, but 
she won't let you. Oh well, at least she will come out and blow you away 
with her bassline madness. Prepare your minds/bodies/souls for this 
earth shaking performance.

::abZ::
savoryaudio.com, FUZZ!
//Dubstep
According to an article in Pittsburgh's CP from 2007, AbZ was credited 
with bringing dubstep to Pittsburgh. He is a very skilled producer whose 
tracks are getting a lot of attention these days! Not to mention that he 
just recently started his own digital label (Savory Audio). His mixes 
are smooth and fresh and sure to make you get down and dirty.

::Nice Nate::
Flux Capacitor, B.A.D. Ass, Sunset til Sunrise, Glow
//Tech-electro
This up and coming PGH dj/producer is starting to blow up around these 
parts! Nice Nate will certainly make you feel very nice and sexy with 
his A++ track selection. No public masturbation allowed! This is all 
ages you know! Don't miss out on this up and coming PGH DJ!!!

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...

event like this is being held here, so please excuse us for our extra cauti=
on.
We are hoping all goes well and that we will be able to return here!!

The land looks great and everything is in full bloom! There about
500 acres of woods for your enjoyment. Come enjoy the art and
the culture that this type of event brings!

***********************************************************

Smokers: The ideal thing to collect your cigarette butts in is a
portable ashtray; please do not litter.

Cars will be allowed to enter the site ONLY for unloading and
uploading;  then they will be parked up by the main entrance in
designated areas only.


We are really looking forward to having each of you out here to our
first outdoor gathering and we can't wait to dance under the stars
with you!! Many of you are coming from out of state. Please have
a safe journey. You are most valuable to us!

I didn't have to watch the little video to know how fucked up SWAT raids

and no one is killed. I've heard people compare SWAT raids to terrorist
attacks and I buy that 100%, complete with the flashbacks and PTSD...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Americans for SWAT Reform

One quick note about flashbacks:

I keep waiting patiently to have my ACID flashback ... but NO, INSTEAD I
get to have a scary one where instead of tripping, I've no longer got a
front door, one of my best friends is being physically brutalized, and
there's a loaded machine gun shoved so far into my naked back that it
leaves a mark ... fun times!

Experimedia is moving announcements away from mailing lists.
At this busy time Experimedia's history we find it more efficient to
feed short and to the point announcements and recommendations through
the twitter platform.
So follow or dont but this is where the news will be

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

www.GMSF.us / www.Gaian-Mind.com / www.Ramblewood.com
NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...
EARLYBIRD TICKET SALES

Earlybird Tickets are ON SALE NOW - Wednesday, April 1st to Wednesday,

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

www.GMSF.us / www.Gaian-Mind.com / www.Ramblewood.com
NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...
EARLYBIRD TICKET SALES

Earlybird Tickets are ON SALE NOW - Wednesday, April 1st to Wednesday, 
April 8th, 2009! Please take advantage of this limited time to purchase

year for Gaian Mind!

Our children's area, KINDERTRIBE, continues to grow every year! Are you 
a parent that would like to add to our activities? Please contact Megan

States. Over Dave.s history he has brought many new styles of house to 
Pittsburgh including Speed Garage in 1997, to the short but sweet 2-Step 
trend that came and went with the millennium, right up the present 
incarnations of deep and funky house which he rocks on the dancefloor, 
leaving a trail of satisfied party goers in his path. As anyone will 
attest to, Dave.s performances are nothing short of AMAZING and filled 
with positive energy which is translated to the people who come to see 
him play. Armed with the latest in music production technology and the 
finest collaborators, Dave Sanchez continues to work on dance floor 
rocking tracks always with the goal of pushing the limits of house.
