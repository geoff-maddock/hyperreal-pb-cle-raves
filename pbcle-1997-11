right on

right on

RIGHTHEFUKON!!!

yo i hope there is intelligent life beyond our planet gill...
i really do hope......

90% is a good guestimate, however the bell curve is accurate only in
arbitrary statistical terms.
the people that get shit done get it done once; the right way.

i just got a really hooked up job representing credit card companies on
college campuses. there are a lot of loopholes in this job feild and the
corporations make money on people that cant do things right the first time,
even if it is simply stated in the training manual how to do it. i really
dont have the balls to call the unfortunate stupid irl, but in actuality,
the bigger percentage of the people dont have the upperhand simply because
they dont take it, and they certainly dont believe in easy money.

which brings me to three categories of people to be read with a scoobie smack





def--
[scoo - be] (scoobie smack???)

*lick* aww shit someones teaching me something. *lick*

i wonder what the gang has to say...

"to anyone that desires to get up on out of that dark place of sameness,
you must wear no shame.. you must seek no fame. you may inherit a fortune
and die untortured, though thats not what its all about. when you tell a
story you kill its memory, but another one is designed to be told and grow
old, with or without you." -=- Fred N -=-

btw--
"Death is God" is a better translation than "God is Dead"

(scoo) like

(be) wow

(do)the 5% on the top of the stairs know all of this and use it.

(be)the 90% in the middle hope all of this not to be true and

(do)the other 5% are the ones that know all of this but are still dreaming
about the possibilities.

o  and i figured out that the all the bad guys are really just part of the
90% that go out of their way to conceal all the lies they believe they
told. what a shame, huh?

I just thought I'd make you guys aware of a few things....

MTV's Indie Outting to possibly air clip of 1.8.7 video.

First off, a clip of 1.8.7 of 1.8.7's
"We.Are.Not.Alone" video *may* air on MTV's program "Indie Outting" when
they do a spot on Liquid Sky/Jungle Sky this Monday November 2. Check
local listings but I believe it comes on at 12 noon, and 7pm EDT..

Defcon 1

The video for Defcon 1 off of his album "When Worlds Collide" is currently 
in production in Pittsburgh and will air on MTV's AMP sometime
this fall/winter.


Album Availability

If you are having trouble finding the album (a few people mentioned this
and one person we know said that breakbeat science didn't have it nor did
some stores in florida) you may want to try Tower Records, the Virgin
Megastore in New York, Sam Goody, and Best Buy (all are supposed to have
it in stock). Note: when looking for it try looking in the normal
drum&bass/jungle or electronica/dance/whatever sections and then if you
don't see it try the rock/pop section (don't ask me why but this is where
we found it at the Tower Records in Philly, in a clearly marked section
titled "1.8.7"). You can also get it online at CDNow (www.cdnow.com).
Try this URL for a direct link: 

http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=541506813/pagename=/RP/CDN/FIND/album.html/
ArtistID=FRN-ONE-EIGHT-SEVEN/ddcn=SD-60174+124+2

(yes I know it's long)


Audio Clips

You can access audio clips of Defcon 1, and When Worlds Collide at the two
URLS below respectively:

http://www.caroline.com/distribution/default.html

and

http://www.papermag.com/paperdaily/paperclips/971001.shtml

Sting this Friday

In case you haven't seen it yet this Friday's Sting promises to be very
good with the whole V-Recordings crew there. Be sure to catch 1.8.7
alongside MC Sphinx performing a blistering live set.

Israel
 
If any of you have friends or relatives in Israel that are into Drum &
Bass 1.8.7 will be performing at two shows, one in Tel Aviv and one in
Jerusalem the week of Dec 9-15. Email 1.8.7 himself at
raver187@m-net.arbornet.org for more details on these show as well as
anything else you'd like to know.

=========================================================

coming from a rich upper middle class white background, i'm
sure that is much easier for you to say then someone who is a
minority and who was born in the ghetto, gill.

i will refrain from taking this debate on to a more personal level
out of respect for you, gill...altho i know you are highly trained in 
the technical aspects of life, there are many things you have yet to
experience in the real world, especially in the area of the under
handedness of the rich and powerful and the evil means through
which they have arrived at their present positions

did anyone notice how the market just recently, mysteriously 
plummeted in Beijing, China right before President Jiang of China 
made his trip to America to make 'The Big Deal' with Clinton 
(ie the stop on arms trade to the middle east in exchange for 
nuclear power plants)...they basically forced the deal by controlling
the market...add to that pressure from the media (ie Seven Years
in Tibet and Red Corner), and you've got yourself an international
power move...this is just one current example of the true powers
of the upper 3%

never did i state one can not improve upon their present financial
situation...however i will say: money is power...and those that have
alot of it, can do anything they want and get away with it whether
you like it or not...just about everyone nowadaze can be bought, if
not, they will be made an offer they can not refuse...which leads to
the next fundamental: information is power and more importantly
private information is power, ie: sex, lies, and videotapes, 
Watergate, Tawnya Harding, the Clinton tapes, etc...and who has
access to all of your personal information?...put two and two 
together and you can figure out the rest...freedom is an illusion,
you are given as much freedom as they will allow you to have...
if they really wanted to, they can very easily destroy your life.

pete sed:
=============================================================
yo i hope there is intelligent life beyond our planet gill...
i really do hope......
=============================================================

it is very ironic that you made this statement, if you had checked
http://www.impropaganda.com/~street/detour/ill1.html thru ill5.html
or have read William Cooper's Behold a Pale Horse, you will learn just
how much intelligent life there is out there and how the government
has kept it covered up quite well from the general public...the movie
Contact, that i saw with you Gill, is based on actual alien radio contacts
that have been made, but have been kept secret all this time by the
government.

===============================================================
i just got a really hooked up job representing credit card companies on
college campuses. there are a lot of loopholes in this job feild and the
corporations make money on people that cant do things right the first time,
even if it is simply stated in the training manual how to do it. i really
dont have the balls to call the unfortunate stupid irl, but in actuality,
the bigger percentage of the people dont have the upperhand simply because
they dont take it, and they certainly dont believe in easy money.
================================================================

you represent exactly the kind of people that i have been trying to get
away from, having worked for one of the largest credit card corporations
in America for over three and a half years, i am all to familiar with the
'loopholes' and underhandedness that can be implemented in the banking
industry...all for the sake of making money...greed is a very scary thing

"make money on people that can't do things right the first time", i can't
believe you would even make such an evil statement...i hope for the sake
of future generations there are less people like you who prey on the short
comings of others (in your case your own peers) for your own profit, but
even more so, the profit of the owners of these major corporations that
thrive on making money with other people's money...but i guess such is the
plight of capitalism...the ultimate fear would be when the other 97% 
(not 90%) finally realize that they don't have to take this shit anymore
and actually do something about it (ie World War III).

but truthfully i hope the top 3% (not 5%, ie: the Illuminati, the Order of
the 
Quest, the Jason Society, the Roshiniya, the Qabbalah, the Knights Templar, 
the Knights of Malta, the Knights of Columbus, the Jesuits, the Masons, 
the Ancient and Mystical Order of Rosae Crucis, the Nazi Party, the 
Communist Party, the Executive Members of the Council of Foreign 
Relations, the Brotherhood of the Dragon, the Rosicrucians, the Royal 
Institute of International Affairs, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg

Group, the Vatican, the Russel Trust, the Skull & Bones, the Scroll & Key, 
the Black Families, etc.) will consider an alternate means to arrive at 
their New Order...capitalism is such a waste of pure energy, energy that 
can be used for a more positive and constructive future rather than simply 
making money for money's sake and slowly wasting or destroying the lives 
of the multiple people that they feel are unimportant (ie minorities, 
homosexuals, the elderly,  the disabled, the unemployed, the lower class, 
the middle class, etc.) or would get in their way of their ultimate dream of
 'the perfect white world'.

i urge you to please refrain from any further debate until you have read
Behold a Pale Horse by William Cooper, which can give you the complete
truth through declassified goverment files...atleast then one can give a
more educated and informed response to the issue at hand...

keep the faith kids, and keep hope alive...

You have got to be kidding.  The reason the Hang Seng dropped had to do
with pressure from currency traders taking advantage of artificially high
interest rates as China continues to peg the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S.
dollar.  The same thing happened in Thailand and Malaysia this summer.
That's what really happened.  It's fun to blame non-related events and
make it look like a spooky situation, but come on.

You have got to be kidding.  The reason the Hang Seng dropped had to

with pressure from currency traders taking advantage of artificially high
interest rates as China continues to peg the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S.
dollar.  The same thing happened in Thailand and Malaysia this summer.

Sorry if these comments were off-topic.  There wasn't much discussion on
the list, and Steve had some interesting ideas that generated thought. 
I'll make certain to only talk about "raves" in Pittsburgh and Cleveland
from now on. 

So, how are those "raves" these day Hossam?  Have you been enjoying the
"raves" in your area?  I know that the "raves" haven't been happening too
much here in Cleveland of late.  But, I look forward to the "rave" in
Oberlin this weekend.  Are you going to that "rave"?  Gee, I hope so.
Well, enough of the "rave" related conversation for now . . . I'm off to
alt.current.world.affairs to post some rubbish.

	i'm sorry, but you have a serious attitude problem braden. i don't
even know who you are, but if you feel like behaving this way, go
somewhere else. this is a rave list, if you have a problem with that, get
off. that's not to say that we can't talk about anything else, but i agree
with hossam in saying that the recent posts are rather annoying and have
nothing to do with this list or the people on it. NO NEED FOR THE
ATTITUDE !!!!!

hi there :)

ok, so andy/sine and i are looking for a ride down to buzz/sting in dc this
fri nite...

i can offer pay *all* gas and tolls there and back, and quite possibly get
the driver in for free...most likely i will just let whoever is in the car sort it
out among themselves...like if 2 ppl want to split it or whatever...(andy
may get his own comp, not sure yet)

ideally, i'd like to leave pittsburgh around 4pm on fri aft'noon, so i can get
to dc no later than 9pm...this would give me an hour to do sound check,
etc...and generally get ready before the performance...i could not leave
any later than 6pm, 6:30 if u drive fast ;)

i'll be at scj tomorrow nite if u wanna meet up...come up and say hi...don't
be shy...i'm nice :P

they may have the decks set up on stage tomorrow nite, we'll see...it'll be
interesting coz i've wanted them there for a while now, but if the crowd
is light, i don't think it'll be such a good thing? i dunno...

i'd really appreciate it if someone could help me out...i can leave
whenever...it'd be cool if we stayed til the end of the party, but if u want
to leave earlier, or if u want to leave on Sunday, just let me know...

peace,
hossam

Thought people might find this interesting - I found that 2 pittsburgh
producers have new releases coming out today.  Here's the descriptions
from an email catalog I just got. :)  Sounds like they're getting good
reviews....

Subject: SLIP DISC: WEEK 44 NEW RELEASES/RESTOCKS

NEW ARRIVALS

1.8.7.  When Worlds Collide ep1 Jungle Sky      
JS121...These two EPs together constitute Jungle Sky's strongest
releases to date.  Brilliant production ranging from the tense & dark No U
turn/31 Records school of fright with filtered percussion and mad mentasm
keys, to jazzier affairs with sexy horns and vocals.     
domestic Drum&Bass  8.00    187-w1  EP      1885

1.8.7.  When Worlds Collide ep2 Jungle Sky      
JS122...Four more killer tracks, from Tech Itch styled madness taken to
a new level with filtered breaks that exchange back & forth, to more
Moving Shadow/Looking Good type excursions.    
domestic        Drum&Bass       8.00    187-w2  EP      1887

Joshua Ryan     Hush / doinyaheadin     Slinky  
SL001...First release on the newly launched Rampant side label devoted
to the smooth and slinky progressive sounds.  "Doinyaheadin" is nine
minutes of pure emotional bliss with squelchy basslines, warm pads and
tight rhythms that rock the house.  "Hush' is an eleven and a half minute
jaunt through trance territory with crisp analog  that rides a bouncy
bassline.      
domestic        Trance  7.00    jr-hus  12"     1868

hi...

what's up to those of you who know me and those who don't...:)

my friend joe (187) and i will be performing at sting this fri, nov. 7 and we
were wondering if anyone could help us out...we like to put on as big a
show as possible when we do an event, joe does live jungle pa's and i
mc, but we always like to add a few bells and whistles whenever
possible...

this summer, at family affair 3, it was joe and i, 2 vocalists singing over
the music, a live percussionist, and a few hundred dollars worth of
fireworks (it was an outdoor show) that made up the '187 experience' ;)

specifically, joe asked me:

"Yeah. I'm thinking of a Family Affair type performance if possible (ie: do
you know anyone who plays percussion in the DC area?) Also anyone
like jugglers, fire eaters, dancers, etc would be cool as Scott I think told
me we'll be on the big stage."
-------------

if anyone here does this type of thing, or knows anyone who would be
interested in this, please reply to:

hossam@topsecret.net

thank you very much, and hope to see you on fri nite...come up and say
hello after the show, we'd be happy to meet you :)

peace,
hossam

I think Braden's "serious attitude problem" has been confused with a damn
good sense of humor....anyways, about the posts.  I think a few
non-rave-related posts now and again are interesting as long as they don't
get outta hand, which they hadn't.  Know what *is* outta control??  All
these useless annoying post bitching about off topic posts!  For every off
topic-usually interesting post there's 2-3 posts bitching about it bein
off topic! :)  Anyways, just friendly perspective on things.

Adding to the clutter by writing a post
commenting about the posts that comment about the
off topic posts, :)

Overload - After attacking those in Boston with a relentless assult of the
finest and freshest jungle business, Mr. Load :) has relocated to our
nation's capitol, Washington D.C., where he regularly mashes it up. Now
that he's had sufficient time to gather ammuntion, he sets his sights on
our city. You have been warned.

DJ2 - A frightening display of mathematical expertise. Watch as he slices
and dices. Our troops in most areas were inable to stop the onslaught. His
"Hyperkick Ryuken" has devastated many battalions, only the SL1200MKII
seem to calm his aggression.

*****
SCJ will be taking place every other Tuesday @ Laga, above the Attic,
Forbes Ave., Oakland. All ages must submit $5US. There will be drink
specials until midnite. Bring a friend (BRING MANY) If you do not
understand, assistance is available: 412.761.8173

I'm pretty sure somebody was asking for some info about what the 187
album was called, and where to get it, and I have some info:

It is called "when worlds collide" and has two aliens smoking a bowl on
the cover

I got it at NRM for $15.

Does anyone know how 412 collective faired with midnite?   I heard that
there weren't many people there, but did they break even or anywhere
near?  What about DJs at t-day?

When is this tour BTW?  Is it a 'rave' type event, or a show like at
Metropol or something.  Anybody catch the 187 video?  I won't be home to
see it, so somebody give me a discription/opinion if they see it.

I put together a little rave survey that I'm going to have in my zine
TECHNOLOGY, but I also have a WWW version @

http://www.pitt.edu/~gmmst22/survey.htm

Its mostly geared towards pittsburgh raves, but anyone from anywhere is
free to fill it out. After I collect alot of responces I'm going to have a
drawing for a free mixtape, so if you're interested in the drawing, put
you'r email address at the end in the 'other comments'.

I don't know what the tape will be, since the drawing won't be for at
least a month, but I'll probably have a choice of at least three (jungle,
hardcore, trance)

Thanks lots,

The tour hits Philly Friday night (the Troc) and Pittsburgh on
Saturday...not at metropol, but at GRAFFITI!!!  Don't know the age
requirements.  Joe is sitting next to me daydreaming about the show he and
MC Sphinx plan to put on for all comers.  No, no dropped pants, but a darn
good show nonetheless. 

By the way, He also plans to do some tape giveaways...some stuff from the
album, some remixes from the album, and some more recent stuff.  A lot of
it is mixed and it's more on-your-feet than the album which is more of a
listening experience.  He wants to hit PB-CLE first on the Net, kind of to
thank the family.  :)  He would write this himself, but his account is
flaky.  Besides, he's approving this as I write.  ;)  Really though, thank
you everybody, for all the kind words and stuff.  

Gosh, both of us are getting misty...Here's Joe...
Hey yinz,
  Can't wait to see all you guys again this Saturday. Philly's nice, but
there's nothing like Pittsburgh (Steph agrees).  Thanks for all the years
of going to parties, shows, etc, buying my tapes (no matter how raw
sounding they may have been ;) Oh yeah, there will be a few special
announcements for the pb-cle family in the weeks ahead. back to steph...

As for the video that MTV showed a small clip of a couple times today,
there's a good chance it will be on Amp some time soon.  And that's not
the only one...  The current one is for "We Are Not Alone", and it has a
lot of space shots and stuff.  Projekthaus's MSKW1 did the design and the
footwork so you know it has a unique aesthetic.  Um, that's about it for
now...

love and ginger beer,
steph

...and joe

has this happened before? =] is it different with other kinds of girls? =]

anyway, i don't understand what would be the point of a netmeet in any
bathroom, besides the fact it's usually not so loud or dark. what do you
do in the event of portapotties? my ideas for them are at a booth if there
is one or pick a corner of the main room: which means it's easy to find +
not in the way of everything.

Midnite went exceptionally well for our first event. It was out in the cut
in derry PA but we got alot of new heads into it. About 250 people were in
attendance. I'm not going to review it cause I can't review my own soiree.

1) yes, this "conspiracy theory" discussion is off-topic 
and should be taken outside.

2) this is what should be controlled, not sleepy c's 
bajillion posts about club nites in the area.  if i weren't 
a part of this discussion, i'd probably be getting really 
annoyed at all this shit in my inbox every evening when i 
got home (not that i'm not anyway =P )

-----

two more things:

1) some people who refuse to stay a part of the ruled 90% 
had actually begun a miniscule amount of discussion of 
providing a D-I-Y event of some type in the Cleveland area 
sometime soon.....what happened?  let's get it up again, 
folks!

hm... I had a good time at midnite considering that:
the directions said it would take 35 minutes to get there... it took an
hour and a half...
the cops came by and things had to be moved down to the tiny basement at 4ish?
every time I went through the hallway kids were like "buy some E!". what
ever happened to being careful selling? 

but it was a good space and a good price... I would have liked an
ambient or trip hop dj downstairs for a chill room....
I was the one wearing the gold sparkely shirt and giving away candy, if
you were there...
oh, and who was the dj that was pulling out the mad hip hop tricks
downstairs... I'm givin him the props...
lets hear it for the underground

hi :)

please pass this info along/post it anywhere you want...

ok, the 187/crystal method show @ the famed rock n roll club graffiti is:

THIS SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 8.

call 412 682 4210 for more info.

i just got off the phone with one of their clueless workers who informed
me that it's an all ages show, doors open @ 7:30, show time is 8:30, he
said it's a late show, but it 'won't be one of those that run til 4am' but then
he also said 'a lot of things slip by me' so caveat emptor...

in other words, call the nite before/day of the show...if u call during the
week you have a good chance of getting a human, who can answer
your questions (the recording right now just says the show is this
Saturday)....i'll post more info as soon as it becomes available :)

has there ever been a party @ graffiti? it's pgh's version of the agora
basically? if there has been a party there, it must have been around
91-92...coz there hasn't been one since...(that i've known of)...it should
be a hoot...i'd like to see us take over pgh's rock and roll establishment
for an evening...:)

what do u guys think?

peace,
hossam

ooh.. whate an adventure this nite was... a great way to spend holloween...
we called the info lines like 5 times on friday only to be told.. call back
in an hour... so, finally, we get these INCREADIBLY complicated directions
and since we were all from out of town, when we heard "its near the
airport" we said, to save some money we'll take the PAT 28X to the airport
for 2 bucks and the take a cab from there...

the info line was not talking about pittsburgh international, but rather
the airport of a town like 2 hrs outside of pittsburgh... we lucked out,
however, our caby (may god bless him and keep him sane) was nice enough to
drive us around in a cab for 3 hrs... we stopped in at a mcdonalds b/c a
friend was hungry (he got a happy meal... for a boy... they gave him a
little taxi-cab... how apropriate... we all thought.. the alternative was a
barbie doll (iewwww ... gross) anyway, the caby stopped the meter after abt
an hr and a half... and he only asked us for $60 (it would have been like
$120+ had he kept the meter running) ...he wes like "this better be one
hell of a party" ... and this is probably the last time he takes a bunch of
kids to a party outside of pittsburgh...

anyway, we finally get there at like quarter to 2 and find some other
friends just getting out of their car.. they wer supposed to take the same
rout we did (but they were gonna take a later bus to the airport) .. thank
god they didnt... they went to the behive instead, and found rides there...
so we decide to head in, almost completely forgetting that when we left the
airport, we took 2 cabs. The other cab never showed up to the fucking
party.

regarding the party...

most of my friends regarded it as just an excuse to do vast amounts of
drugs... i must have been one of the like four people who was sober in the
space... there was some good e going around.. and it seems like everyone
was on it.. i walked through the door w\ out even my shit being searched...
which i guess is cool, but it just kind of foretells what kind of
experience it will be.

i dont know if i agree w\what everyone was saying though, because i was
sober, and i had a shitload of fun... its too bad the cops came w\ a
complaint abt the noise level so the party had to be moved downstairs...
but it was all good. The music was decent, SINE never showed up (he
probably couldnt find the fucking party) which kinda sucked since i had
come simply b/c he was gonna be there...it didnt really matter however,
some of the music was very good, and i found myself dancing the night away.

Everyone was really open and nice.. i saw some people from deep, revibe,
and history there.. as well as scj which i thought was nice... i heard they
were giving out free water at the end... that would have been fucking
awsome... i couldnt stay till the end b/c my ride home was ready to go...
although i had actually left for the party intending not to stay that
late.. so it was good... 

> Midnite went exceptionally well for our first event. It was out in the
cut
> in derry PA but we got alot of new heads into it. About 250 people were
in
> attendance. I'm not going to review it cause I can't review my own
soiree.

there were how many people there?? boy, i need to learn how to count all
over again... i could have sworn there were no more than 80 people at this
party... (if that much) ... but i liked it, it would haev been nice if it
was this big event or whatever.. and if more poeple had worn a costume...
(i didnt, so i guess i cant complain)

in case ayone was there, i was the dude in big green pants, a white t-shirt
and glasses... 

shout outs...

Daniel... how was your 1st party baby? thank u, for back rubs, hugs, and
all around good vibes.. sorry i lost your cid .. i'll make it up to u.

MIke... Happy birthday dude... i still have your little car in my bag... st
joungle tonight? i'm not sure i can make it.. but we will see...

Donny found Ricky...Donny found Ricky...
yeiiiIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Erica and Joel... thank u, for help w\ the ride home, for the use of your
glowsticks, and for adding so much to the evening overall... Erica: see u
in the UC basement this thurs.

directions, but if you are interested in coming, email me, or leave a message
on the voicemail (330) 649.0308 and i'll call you back.  

if the preparty happens, the line-up is going to be something like this..
Dreamweaver (live pa)
Hesohi (dj set)

Circuitry (dj set or live pa)
Daddylonglegz (live pa) 

 any other acts interested email or call the voicemail

"Sorry I lost your 'cid?"

"Everyone on there was on good e?"

Let's bear in mind that this list can be watched.  Don't be a moron.
The last thing I need is the man like stick getting in trouble because
he's responsible for the party.

and that's all i have to say about that.  Further comments may be
forwarded to mignutts@gett.off.org

 steve im sorry if feel the need to call me greedy, i just want to pay for
my new synthesizer and my books for classes next semester bro.

i dont feel inclined to read government conspiracy tactics; it sounds like
hacker speak to me. but i do appreaciate reading one of the greatest
conspiracy theorists of all time: Frederick Nietzsche.
i really feel bad for him; no one can take his angst seriously, even if he
is dead.
Im reading "Thus Spoke Zarathrustra" a collection of short stories written
by him with the same vein, just a fictional setting. sort of like a movie,
but not as succulent.

Wow, that was a while ago...I didn't even know there was a video.  Well,
story goes Lenny shot the video and he's in Erie.  I don't if he's on here
or not...  Joe doesn't think he ever got a copy but will check to make
sure.

later the President of the USA and more importantly the key reason

that's not a very promotional copy considering it was released a good
while back.  however the new single (brown paper bag remix/western) was
released this past monday and it's quite wicked.

also good is adam f's album "colours", released this past monday as well.

I think it might be something like the "US" release, and the uk release
was a while back.  We just got the Reprazent album less than a month ago
at WPTS.  I'm guessing this is when the album started getting its distro
in the chain stores.

I wish we'd get a promo for that.

Dj's yo! I'm throwing a party in January in the Cleveland vacinity. I'm still
in search of a few Jungle/Drum & Bass dj's for the line up. If your interested
please e-mail me personally. It's gonna be a slammin' line-up so I want some
experienced DJ's to fill in the rest. If your interested and have a tape to
send me pronto, write me back. I would like to get some talent from the
Pittsburgh area, but Cleveland is cool too. 

peace out in the valley...

1) yes, this "conspiracy theory" discussion is off-topic 
and should be taken outside.

2) this is what should be controlled, not sleepy c's 
bajillion posts about club nites in the area.  if i weren't 
a part of this discussion, i'd probably be getting really 
annoyed at all this shit in my inbox every evening when i 
got home (not that i'm not anyway =P )
=========================================================

i think lonnie put it best on his latest ultraworld flyer: this is
a free country, and we have a right to free speech and we have
a right to peacefully assemble.  those that oppose this, can leave
this country...his words, not mine

actually list traffic is about half as much as it used to be, i 
thought the pb-cle-rave list was dead for awhile...but frankly,
altho jamie is 'the pope' of pb-cle-raves, with all due respect, 
i think the best discussions are the ones that are uncensored 
and have very little to do with raves whatsoever...plus after 
almost four years on this list, i'm kind of sick of hearing about 
the same ole same ole...

i think it's high time we finally looked beyond the speakers and 
at the world around us...has anybody else noticed that there have 
been more natural disasters lately around the world than ever 
before...blizzards in Colorado w/ snowdrifts 14 feet deep, many 
of the Mediteranean islands are expected to vanish underwater 
due to global warming, huge wildfires in the amazon caused by
the worst drought in 25 years there, volcanic eruptions in Sumatra
and Mexico City, Earthquakes in Italy, Japan, Taiwan, Southern 
China, Peru, San Francisco, & Alabama, rare torandos in Argentina 
and Costa Rica, typhoons hitting the Caroline Islands and near 
Japan, forest fires in Indonesia, plus with El Nino approaching
things are supposed to get even worse...or am i the only one keeping
track of the signs again?

...think about the future, you are the future...

===========================================================
1) some people who refuse to stay a part of the ruled 90% 
had actually begun a miniscule amount of discussion of 
providing a D-I-Y event of some type in the Cleveland area 
sometime soon.....what happened?  let's get it up again, 
folks!
============================================================

i'll give you props Gill, you & tiggah put together one of the best
D-I-Y events i've ever attended, you don't get that much closer
to heaven than a DIY party on a roof top 13 stories up!

has anyone noticed the best partys seem to be the one's outdoor
or closer to nature...Interstellar 1-3, Family Affair 1-3, Further
1-3, Emerald Forest, Sleepy C's Deep Records Free Outdoor party
in Geneva, etc...

perhaps in the future, all of the partys will be outdoor tribal
gatherings, mebbe tony ramos can hook up w/ the guys who did
the visuals for IO2 (anode?) and make some tripped out 
environmentally conscious visuals...has anyone ever been to a
Consolidated concert before?...i heard Ed has some some extra TV's...

uh oh, do i see a 'Family of Light' gathering in the future...

d a r k s i d e  5 :: journey from the light 
columbus ohio, fri 31 oct 97

DARKSIDE 5 was intended to be an event that was hard to find.  the flyer
was printed on black paper with black ink so performer names were
difficult--but not impossible--to figure out.  these flyers were only
handed out sporadically, and the lineup itself was never mentioned on the
voicemail or anywhere else except if you specifically emailed me (it was
finally available at the event itself, as a printed program/lineup with
short biographies).  this was not an excuse to be elitist, nor to be
mysterious, but mostly to see how an event might happen if the only thing
you knew about it was that it would be hard, dark music all night--
appropriate for halloween.  it was also intended as a statement, a
literal return to the darkness; that metaphysical concept of what
uncompromising, undiluted electronic music events can be. 

the event was held in the same space that housed the multitudes at
METAMORPHOSIS, but this time only the long, narrow entrance hall was used
in anticipation of a smaller, more intimate crowd.  as indeed it was, with
total attendance near or just above 300 people.  a curious effect was that
the larger part of the warehouse was visible from the hallway, so there
was a sense of denial, of unfulfilled potential...

and like many ele_mental events, it is hard to say exactly when the event
started--there is always that awkward time between soundchecking and the
time the first actual performer/DJ gets going. 

in this case, it was probably even more confusing because the first
performer's entire set (running from approx. 11:15 PM - 12 :15 AM) could
have been mistaken for a soundcheck.  of course it was not--it was a new
group of noise artists named AXESS, comprised of former solo noise
experimenter SPINE (steven wymer) with the addition of friends nikki and
justin doing various visuals and playing live instruments/random metal
junk.  noise music itself can be an aggravating experience for those who
do not understand it or care to listen with deeper intensity, but in this
case, the myriad levels of sound (including the usual electronically-
oriented noises, along with steve's abstract vocals and nikki's live junk
noise) were engaging and exciting, bringing a live feeling to the event. 
these disturbing sonic sculptures set the tone perfectly for the evening. 
not for the meek at heart.

the next performer was BAMBULE COMMANDO, aka gordon sharp, a londoner via
scotland who has been residing in columbus for the last several months. 
although he has been working on the outer fringes of electronic and
experimental music for 20 years (as the head architect/vocalist of the UK
outfit CINdYTALK), he is careful not to claim he is a DJ, but his approach
has liberating impilications nonetheless.  his music continued in the vein
of AXESS, playing a 45-minute set that continued to defy the expectations
of those who expected to come to a "rave" and have a great time.  this was
not for them (they were the ones hanging out outside waiting for the party
to "start," as usual ;), but it was for those interested in expressions of
sonic purity.

the liberating aspect of his DJ style is that he does not beatmix at all,
using a technical limitation to his advantage to create deliberately
shocking and abrupt changes in sonic contours.  to say he cannot spin,
however, would be a drastic miscalculation, as he is an artist of the
highest order, creating a set of music that at times vaguely resembled
those forms of music we used to call techno, electro, hardcore, and
drum&bass, but whose ultimate result was an obliteration of forms
underpinned by a deep, growling hum of grime and dust and noise (marred
only by some modest sound problems that created some unwanted feedback and
a bit more distortion that desired).  

even more surprising, perhaps, was gordon's incorporation of vocals into
his own DJ set...not entirely unlike MCing.  he growled, yelled, screamed,
chanted and made percussive sounds with his voice, going perfectly with
the music.  it may seem very hard to imagine someone "singing" over their
own set, but to experience it was to witness a true vocalist at work,
exercising total control over his voice in a way that flowed seamlessly
with the sounds his records produced.  this was not a rock'n'roll show,
but a vocal performance by someone who truly understands uncompromising
underground dance music and works within it to create something uniquely
his own.  in so doing, gordon reveals the borders between which he seeks
to navigate;  bringing to light the now-obvious links between punk and
techno, combining the best aspects of both into a new configuration that
seems to be both punk and techno, and neither.  a mindblowing, important
experience. 

the madness continued at about 1 AM as DR. DESTRUCTO (tim madonna) took to
the tables, beginning quite cheekily with double copies of "scarborough
fair" by simon & garfunkel before entering into a wild set of banging
techno to get the party into a realm that the ravers could finally
understand.  gordon continued his vocal improvisations throughout, yelling
things such as "DARKSIDE 5: LISTEN TO THE ELE_MENTALS," and soon
POWERHOUSE (kevin kennedy) joined on the 2nd set of tables for a tag team
and partial solo set that pushed techno into some of the hardest areas
possible.

at 2 AM, ROTATOR, detroit's original drum&bass assassin, was up.  he
modified one set of tables to increase their speed and proceeded to play
an hour of some of the most destructive drum&bass ever heard, using almost
every trick at his disposal, from hip-hop oriented mixing tricks to ideas
unique to the man himself, such as DJing with a plastic ice cream lid
(into which he apparently cut a groove), and placing the needle carefully
on the inner ring of the bare metal platter itself, then even going so far
as to BEATMIX the loud scraping/popping sound into a jungle track.

by this time the crowd reaction was more enthusiastic, as onlookers
crowded around to see what kind of martial arts this crazy DJ would try
next.

at 3 AM, SHIVA (aka lisa smith) took over after the mayhem and worked the
crowd into a frenzy with her crunchy selection of hard techno.  this
resident of indianapolis is just now getting some well-deserved attention,
and several people asked who this "new" DJ was.  her namesake being the
god/goddess of destruction, lisa's tightly controlled mastery of the
tables did not forsake a destructive edge. 

our good friend and long-time associate, paris mack from detroit (1/2 of
heckle & jeckle), followed at 4 AM, making his debut in his new persona,
SCIENTIFIC.  the name change was prompted by his disillusionment with his
native detroit scene, and culminated in his liquidation of most of his
record collection.  with this set he started anew, playing a deep set of
dark, clinically precise drum&bass. 

at the end of his set i myself began to mix into his selections with a few
drum&bass selections of my own, and we tag teamed for another several
tracks, gleefully messing up as we tried to organize 4 sources of sound
into one cohesive drum beat.  then, due to the disppearance of MONOCHROME
(charles noel, an OSU grad student, need i say more), BLIP (kevin ginger)
joined me in a 4-turntable set of electro, deep smooth techno, and tracky
house before i ended the night with some beautiful comedown tracks such as
the 4 hero mix of D-note's "waiting hopefully."

a successful evening, musically, as well as vibewise.  as an event not
really intended to appeal to "ravers" (in the midwest sense of the word),
the event succeeded in making the bold statement that i intended.  black
flyer, pure music, little promotion, cheap price...and people came. 
perhaps they did not care, or understand, but in either case, i got away
with pushing the rave phenomonon into areas which have yet to be explored
in this region.  some might say we've begun pushing into areas that NO
ONE has explored, but that remains to be seen.  it's an exciting prospect
nonetheless. 

all told, out of the 300 attendees, about 180 paid $5.00, the rest paid
$2.00, or even nothing, due to a rather open-door policy and shady kids
giving each other their entrance stickers.  can you believe people are
that wack to try to get out of paying **$5.00** (or even less!!) to get
into a party?  oh well, it was because of them that money was actually
lost: out-of-town DJs were shorted, the ever-faithful jericho sound cru
was not paid enough, most of my own investment was eaten, and all my
helpers (including door cru, and all in-town performers/DJs--some of whom
worked the door!) made no money.  but it's okay.  the main expenses were
covered, i got a little bit back, and everyone either got something, or at
least went home feeling like they had made a positive contribution to a
special event. 

more importantly, i've continued to learn a great deal from our so-called
scene, as fleeting as it may be.  even as a 27-year old "rave promoter" 
(arg) who is supposed to be jaded, new things are revealed to me every
time. 

of course, next time i'll keep the entrance airtight so as to make sure to
get our money back in, but mainly, i was reminded about how little money
it really takes to create expressions of such purity.  what really counts
is finding some people who have a fire inside them, who seek--more than
anything else--those rare moments where purity of expression is made
possible, and where true intensity of experience can be attained.  body
and mind CAN be brought together...tentatively, awkwardly, delicately...
and experimental raves are one site (among others) where this is beginning
to happen in real ways.  i fully expect to continue exploring these areas
for myself--in some ways i still feel like i'm just starting out.

expect more events like this to occur.  and i don't mean NEXT halloween.

just a note to apologize if my "review" of my own event seemed a bit
self-serving.  it wasn't too bad, but i did want to explain that i write
those kinds of reviews as unfinished drafts for a possible future website
that will delve a bit deeper into our past events.  usually i'm honest
about what i like and don't like, but for such reviews i may temper any
misgivings a bit because if they're supposed to end up on a webpage about
the party, i don't want it to be just about my personal opinions, but
rather more descriptive...so that's my mindset.  if it's something i feel
is worth writing more about (like bambule), i'll do it, especially if it's
not something you see every day.  but in the case of darkside i definitely
liked every artist, for different reasons.

thanks to those of you who wrote and expressed your thoughts about my post
or the party, it's good to hear from listmembers who are interested.

WERD!

I just thought I'd pass this along to the family..

I just found out today that the video for my track "We Are Not Alone" will
air on MTV's AMP next friday, Nov 14. There's alot of space footage and
party footage from Pittsburgh in it so check it out. I believe it comes on
at 2am Friday night unless they changed it. Check the TV section to be
sure.

========================================================
WERD!

========================================================

;) here's the 'werd' according to The Gospel of John (another
book i've been reading)...

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.  He was with God in the beginning.
    Through him all things were made; without him nothing
was made that has been made.  In him was life, and that
life was the light of men.  The light shines in the darkness,
but the darkness has not understood it.
   There came a man who was sent from God; his name was
John.  He came as a witness to testify concerning that light,
so that through him all men might believe.  He himself was
not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.  The
true light that gives light to every man was coming into the
world.
   He was in the world.  And though the world was made 
through him, the world did not recognize him.  He came to
that which was his own, but his own did not recieve him.
Yet to all who recieved him, to those who believed in his
name, he gave the right to become children of God - 
children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision
or a husband's will, but born of God.
[...]
   Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem
sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.  He did not 
fail to confess, but confessed freely.
"I am not the Christ."
   They asked him, "Then who are you?  Are you Elijah?"
He said, "I am not."
   "Are you the Prophet?"
He answered, "No."
   Finally they said, "Who are you?  Give us an answer to take
back to those who sent us.   What do you say about yourself?"
   John replied in the words of Isiah the prophet, "I am the
voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way 
for the coming of the Lord.'"

Last night, for all you that don't know the crystal method played at
graffitti with 187 opening for him.  This show all though quite expensive
($11 for three hours) was worth every penny.  

187
187 brought the fucking roof down!  I have seen him once before, and
honestly wasn't too impressed, but this time he reaffirmed my faith in
him.  His set was solid, with few weak points.  allthough the music was
good, the best part (in my opinion) was the way he and Mc Sphinx got the
crowd riled up.  When you look up at him with his head banging on two and
four and the occasional jump up in the air, it just makes you want to
dance.  The opening two songs were by far the best in my opinion, even
though the rest were very good as well.  Afterwards he passed out about
20 of his tapes . . . which I am listening to right now.  

Crsytal Method
This performance was very good.  They played a set of what would best be
described as acid breaks or trance breaks or something.  It was good,
with some incredible build ups.  The best part about this was the 12
intellibeams (or something very similar to intellibeams) lined upbehind
them in a semi-circle.  This just created a great effect.  The four huge
strobe lights on both side of the stage were spectacular as well.  At the
end of their performance,  one of the two members threw his synth on the
ground and kicked it!

Sine
Sine played for a while at the begining and in between 187 and crystal
method, and wasn't anything too special.  I don't know how to describe
it, but it wasn't very motivating.  

The crowd was definitely different than at normal raves, I guess due to
the fact that it was a concert, it was at graffitti, and that crystal
method is more mainstream than your average DJ.  But it was very well
attended, and it seemed like a good time was had by all.

i came late because of my ride....grrrr...


anyways, i came i suppose during sine's set right before crystal method.
 it was alright.  the crowd didn't seem to into it but imho i thought it
was okay.  so, anyways, was the crowd wack or what?   i felt like i was
at a rock concert or something.  everyone just stood around looking at
the stage.  
oh, and i didn't recognize anyone there.  not a big deal, the few people
that i knew there said the same exact thing.  i didn't mind it was nice
seeing new faces but i'm just wondering where they all came from.  alot
of them looked real young.  and like nobody was dancing.  i went towards
the stage and i felt like i was in a mosh pit so i had to retreat under
the balcony.  and what was with the 1.00 for a cup of water thing?  i've
been to some shows at the graffitti before and they only charged .50 for
water before.  okay, so enough of my gripings...

crystal method got a lot better since planet orange where i saw them
last.  i thought their set sounded alot like the chemical brothers.  did
anyone else agree.  i still thought they sounded good though.  


so is ANYONE going to that party on the 15th?  i already forgot the lineup.

yes... their style WAS quite similar to the chemical brothers, but if you
listen closely, you will notice that crystal method isn't just writing
music because they are full of themselves.

it's a damn shame that you missed 187, because he seriously tore shit up.

what's up everyone...:)


just wanted to send a shout out to all the kids who supported the show
and turned out on sat nite...esp. brian from cmu (email me) and erika and
andy and kira, and most importantly, everyone who was dancing and
enjoying themselves to sine, 187, and the crystal method...

ok, fri nite was sting...usual big party hype, but the rain down in dc
apparently kept quite a few kids away...it wasn't nearly as full as a
normal buzz, let alone a sting (which are usually rammed)...doors didn't
open til nearly 11, and the crowd trickled in thereafter...john tab opened
up the jungle room, what little i heard of his set was good...

bryan g opened things up for the v records crew...mc moose rocked it,
he is an example of a true uk jungle mc...after him came jumping jack
frost who tore the place apart...he spun a lot of body rockin bassline
tracks...and you know what (to be *completely* honest)? a lot of his
tracks sounded like what 187 has been making over the summer and the
past few months...interesting. :) ray keith closed it out on a crappy note.
blah boring uninspired techstep he played mutant revisited (i'm not a
jungle snob in terms of track selection, but c'mon, u expect more from
one of the uk's top jungle djs)...he never kept me in the room, i would
walk thru the jungle room when jack frost was playing and each time i
would have to stand and listen for a few minutes...:)


in the main room, i guess lieven opened up and played trance til 1am,
then joe and i went on...the lights and soundsystem in the main room
were wicked...joe played for about an hour...i'd say there were maybe
800 kids in the main room...the kids were moderately into it, but apart
from a few high points, it wasn't the greatest...nothing wrong with joe's
set, he turned it out...it was just that all too familiar east coast i'm gonna
stand around and do nothing shit. after joe came scott henry, then astral
matrix, who was one of the best acts in the main room that nite (joe was
the only jungle set in a nite full of acid/trance/house)...then micro, then
carlos...

after sleeping a few hours, we hopped in the car and drove straight to
graffiti, with no time to spare. set up the gear, did a quick soundcheck,
and then left to clean up and change back at my place while andy/sine
spun...he was taking advantage of the opportunity to play a lot of tracks
to kids who never heard jungle before, but i can't really comment on his
set coz i wasn't there for most of it...

our set went pretty well i thought :) we had the pleasure of a new
addition, a live drummer (hi spike) that had expressed interest in jamming
alongside 187...this was the first time we all had worked together, and
we didn't have any practice time, but i'll say that it worked out pretty
nicely at times, considering the circumstances...better things to come in
the future i'm sure :)

187 started off with a lot of his more energetic tracks, and the you guys
seemed to like them :) definitely a lot more energy in that room than there
was in dc on fri nite...shows u don't need a $20 lineup to have a good
time...:) 

joe dipped into some of his newer, more atmospheric tracks towards the
end...'ghetto style' is one of my favorites (has the female vocal
sample...'if u don't know what ghetto style is by now, i guess we gotta
break it down for ya')...we wanted to close off the show with a
reworked version of a pgh jump up favorite (joe's remix of 'da bomb' -the
bucketheads track) but the crystal method ppl were hurrying us
along...again, a big thank you to everyone who came out and enjoyed
it...see you at scj next tues, right? ;)

crystal method: awesome. it would have worked even better at a huge
party with about 1000 ppl in the main room tho...that light show (worth
over $10,000) was too cool for that little room, it was super-blinding,
even if u closed your eyes u still felt it burn your retinas...not having any
sunglasses, about halfway thru the show i said fuck it and kept my eyes
open and just watched all the pretty little stars float through my field of
vision ;)

their show was a very good mix...50% was presentation, 50% was
content...the lights and sound complimented the music really well, that's
due to their extremely competent (they were all english, i have to add)
tech crew...i wasn't ready for the show to be over at 11:45 (they played
for like 1:15-1:30), and eventually a lot of ppl found their way over to
soba...for $3 (it's 21 and up) it's a fun time...dusty played some nice
house classics and everyone was in a really sociable mood...(soba is in
shadyside at the corner of ellsworth and maryland, next to the college
inn, past the unimart)...it's a nice little club :)

that's about it for now...keep the reviews coming, and make sure you
guys keep on going out so we can keep these things going on...

fyi, the promoter of the show on sat nite really liked how things turned
out and "wants to bring more of these electronica type shows in"...so tell
your friends :)


peace and respect,
hossam

Anybody looking to go to Temptation:  
	It's at the Eastland Mall. It's near Century III.  There was a
party there a few weeks ago.  The promoter is real cool chic.  If you've
been to any Sunshine Kids' productions, you've probably seen her.  She's
the little one with short darkish blonde/light brown straight hair wearing
the red devil horns headband.  
	Also in the second room, there will be a live p.a. by Greg Shiff.
He's from Conneticut and currently go to Indiana University for
Composition.  Um, no that's NOT IUP!!!  It's actually in Indiana.  So, hey
everybody out there in civilization, throw some love out to a poor
Pittsburgh raver stuck, through rotten talent circumstances, in Bumfuck,
Nowhere.  I'm feeling the pangs of withdrawal, um from dancing, that is.
							Affectionately,
							Jen Foulmood

Okay, here is my review of Time, which took place saturday night at usa
skating place.  

First of all, we get there at 10oclock to set up the sound and lights, but
the people that own the space say we have to wait for 45 minutes, which would
give us a total of 15 minutes to set up if we were to open on time.  Well,
that obviously didn't happen as anyone that got there before midnite could
tell you.. So we let people in and made them stay off the rink floor for
about 45 minutes.. While people were getting let in, the rink's security took
people's water from them if they found it, even though assured us that people
could bring it in, as long as none of us were selling it.
After a little while, the first dj kicked off the house room.  Dj Unix
started out and played an awesome set, even though the lights were on for
about 1/2 of it. 
After working out a few kinks in the other room's sound, Tsunami got started
with an excellent live pa.  Here is the order of acts as they appeared, which
got quite fucked up since of the late start and also because of dj's personal

unfortunately, because of the time delay, there was not enough time to have
daddylonglegz and soothsayer play live..  

I thought everyone that spun or played live did an EXCELLENT job and it
seemed like everyone was enjoying themselves quite a bit.  The final turnout
was somewhere between 700 and 850, but only about 600 paid, since several
people snuck in thru the side door and we had a huge guestlist.  Also,
someone felt compelled to tag the hell out of the floor, the walls, the
lockers, the bathrooms, etc. which ended up costing us some cash =)  oh
well..  i hope it was as worth it for everyone that showed as it was for us
throwing it.

I was wondering if anyone had heard whether a date had been set for the
Crystal Method playing in Cleveland.  I had heard a rumor that they'll be
at the Odeon in November.  Is this confirmed?

We have been working very hard updating our web pages and adding
new features, and especially getting ready to add our biggest addition
yet:   www.ravedata.com     
Our tape collection grows almost daily.  We have someowhere close to 300
tapes in our collection and are looking to continue trading with everyone.
We love to do FAST and honest trades.  We are not out to make a buck but
to just exchange the music we all love so much =)  We have FIVE double
cassette decks, tons of blank tapes (bulk Maxxel XL-II 90's and 60's) and
are ready to trade with a whole bunch of people!
In addition to this we have added a list for tape traders to post hteir
names, addresses and email address so people can get in touch with you to
trade tapes and even a message board to post particular interest in tapes
such as "Looking for Trance tapes"...we have also done this for flyer
traders, so anyone that is interested check out our newly updated web
pages at:
www.partnercomm.com/~tapes/
www.partnercomm.com/~flyers/

Thanks and we hope to hear from you soon!
Love-
Nicole & Matt

If you've got cable you may want to watch AMP tonight (or better yet tape
it). The video for "We.Are.Not.Alone" will finally air tonight and I
believe next Saturday. Check your listings but I believe AMP air on MTV at
2:00am Fri and 1:0am Saturday. There are lots of space scenes and shots of
Pittsburgh raves so you may see someone you know :). Props to MSKW1, the
executive director and props to Charlie (DJ Phoenix) and his brother Jason
for shootin the footage. Oh yeah, and props to NASA for releasing the
video tape of the space shuttle astronauts seeing a UFO :)

Is this event still goin' on this weekend, even with TEMPTATION going on?

I still can't decide what to do...although free sure sounds better than
paying $15 for myself and a friend...still I'm in the mood for some good
trance...argh!!

Is there actually dance space @ Sip?  I'v never been there so i don't
really know what its like.  Anyone?

On another tip: Anyone interested in supporting an all 'hard' party in
december?  There's some plans in the works, but nothing for sure -
possibly in december here in pgh, with a couple happy djs a couple gabber
djs, some hardtrance and techno, maybe one junglist, and some illbient 
Mostly I'm wondering if there's interest enough to have it in a
club/rented space as opposed to a smaller houseparty...

dats it.
hope to see people at temptation/nato whatever i doo...

Who wants Temptation?
---We do!!
When do we want it?
---Saturday!!!


	I hear there are some people agonizing over the "which event"
decision.  Think of it this way.  So may people complain that we don't
support the scene, everything and everyone's shady, etc.  Go out on
Saturday night and support Little Devil Productions.  Temptation is their
first party, it's a fact that the promoters are on the level(i.e. no
shadiness involved), and, to top it all off, there's going to be the first
Cafe 2000 Smart Bar in months!!!  Now who's gonna beat that.
	I've also heard, from very very old-school ravers, that Sip is
awfully phat, but if they follow any of the club/coffee house trends that
have been set in Pittsburgh for the last two or three years, then they'll
be here and having many more events.  Just a thought.

Please excuse the slightly off topic post, but I have two Stanton
Trackmasters for sale.  They are in mint condition with cases.  They
still sound great but it would be a good idea if you replace the stily. 
Each stylus goes for about $30 from PSSL.  Please send all inquiries and
serious offers to me:

I know this is sort of a short notice and that netmeets usually don't
work, but we'll give it a try...

	If any of you are going to temptation tonight, lets try to meet outside
the general bathroom area at midnight... I should be fairly easy to
spot... For those of you who went to the 1.8.7. / crystal method show, i
was the guy playing drums for 1.8.7. ... I'll probably have on a
long-sleeved adidas shirt (u know, the one w/ stripes down the
sleeves)...

	See you all tonight....

well... to make a long story short, about 20-30 min. into dieselboy's
set, they announced that the rave was over (i think because the road were
getting really bad, but i also heard noise violations). everyone was SO
swoll. i give props to turrell for trying to start his little "raver
revolution" when everyone was just standing around in the mall, but it
fizzled out pretty quickly.

ps... i swear to god - there was'nt heat anywhere in the whole damn
building! if you weren't dancing, then you needed a jacket!

I had a really great time at this rave (party, event or whatever).  Music
was great, location was pretty damn cool (especially the carpeted hardware
store that was used as a side room) and I actually got to meet some fellow
cmu ravers!  It was rather cold inside, but I actually thought this
was great as I could dance without overheating so quick.  There was a
LOT of people there, quite surprising considering all the snow out on the
roads.  The vibe seemed pretty good to me with most everyone dancing or
just enjoying the impressive light show.   In fact as far as I could tell
there were only 5 or 6 problems and they were all wearing badges.  When I
got there, there was a fairly long line (for a rave at least).  They were
giving everyone very complete searches (checked the liner in my cap,
etc.).  Some cop swore at me for holding the door open.  In general they
didn't seem to be all that polite and I was VERY bummed when the event was
shut down around 5:30 or so.  Still I had a very good time and I will
definately be keeping an eye out for other little devil productions.

Props to all the dj's and especially product 19, dieselboy and the guy
making techno/trance in the side room with just a keyboard and sampler
(some of this shit was really wicked!).  Thanks to Sam and Blythe and the
rest of the gang for giving me a ride and just generally being around to
make the evening so fun (and putting up with my need to take pictures of 
everything and one).  Thanks to Costa for just being there and letting me
burrow the glowsticks.  

Peace, 
JP

I have a bunch of pictures of this event and will try to put some of them
up on a web page once I get them developed.  I should have a great one of
a bunch of cops beating the shit out of a plate glass window!

Hi Jen,
      I'm not sure if you heard or not but "Temptation" got shut down around
4:45 a.m.!!!!   It was ironic because the second that I decided to close up
and call it a night...the music stopped and the police rolled in!!!!!!  They
said that neighbors were complaining??????  MEANWHILE!!!!!!  The cloest
"neighbor" was more then 300 yards away????

This party had so much potential... and yet, in the end, it was just
another mediocre event...

most of u have probably heard that the party got
shutdown/busted/whatever... 

some of the music was very good, most of it, however, was not...

the space was nice... although it was absolutely freezing in the main room
and entance & bathroom areas...

there werent as many people there as i thought there would be.. if u called
the info line, it was as if they expected  a zillion people from all over
the place (reminds me of how the flier for IT! had airport accomodations)
... then again, to their credit, it was snowing and the driving conditions
were disgusting... so maybe thats why the turn out was what it was...
having said that, i should point out that there were a couble hundred
people there...

my biggest problem w\ this party was the vibe... it was an awkward one...
not a bad vibe per se, just not a good one -- if any at all... i don't
know, i felt as though the crowd wasn't into it last night... maybe it was
just me... i hadnt eaten since 2:00 yesterday morning, and was too tired
[and absolutely starving] to dance all taht much.. although i danced quite
a bit... also, some of the people who i ran into who i had intended to
chill w\ were sick.. so i spent a good deal of my time in the corners w\
them... it was wierd.. as if i was completely oblivious to the party around
me... which is rare... i mean, chilling w\ friends is a big part of the
whole night.. the whole experience, and yet, last night i felt as if it
would have been much cooler if we chilled at someones house... maybe it was
b/c all i could think abt was food, and some hot tea.. omg, i had the
biggest craving for some coffee last night... it was so wierd...

another thing... although i recognised many people from other parties..
some people who i had expected would be there ended up not showing... (they
never said they would come... but u kinda just assume they'll be there, u
know?)

when the party shut down, there were a few awkward moments... it was
semi-cheotic, my friends and i took a cab out and intended to find rides on
the way home... which we did, but my bags and things were in the second
room, and i was in the 1st watching dieselboy... so i had to run to get my
shit... but then there was like a stampeed of people comming from the
second room.. thankfully, i found my bag, allthough the people watching it
for me had left it there.. completely unattended... which i hate... i
almost never put my bag down at a party... but i was assured that someone
would be watching it at all times (which obviously they weren't) ... in the
end i climbed into a car w\ like six people in it already, b/c i couldnt
find the dude who had promissed me a  ride... (i hope he didnt spend 4 hrs
looking for me... but if that was the case, then i'll have to make it up to
him...) 

we were sitting in the car and talking abt the party in general, and how it
sucked that it got busted, our oppinions over all, and abt the shady
assholes who broke the glass pannels which separated the 2nd room from the
rest of the party... suddenly, i find out that one of the people in the car
i was in was one of those shady assholes.. i ast there like... what the
fuck were u thinking, dude?

his response kind of confused me... but i still thought taht was shady as
hell.. although, after spending 20 minutes in the car w\ him he seemed
fairly chill... wierd how that happens some time... he explained what he
did as an accident... now if thats for real, is anyones guess...

anyway... thats my story on temptation... overall, not a bad nite... too
bad it had to end all early... but its cool b/c i was finally able to get
food once i got home...

Costas.

	Hello all...I'm new to the list and actually to the scene as
well.  I've traded tapes of and have been a headphone freak of many
styles of the groove for a while.  It wasn't until just recently that
went to my first party (midnite-halloween night @ the bakery in Derry,
PA). This being my first experience I was kind of curios if anyone else
from the list had gone and how that party compares to most others
(personal reference purposes only : ) .  So please let me know what ya
thought.  Personally, I had a really good time and a very positive
experience.  I guess I sorta expected to get dissed and relieve the
general ill looks I come to expect from most  "scenes"  (I've heard of
the tight sense of community that generally runs with the raver crowd and
knowledge of how many OTHER scenes politics and BS get in the way of the
spirit, this all  influenced my false impressions). Being insecure, and
for the most part a shut-in, I feared I wouldn't be accepted (yeah I know
pretty juvenile : ).  I was pleasantly suprised when these irrational
feelings subsided and I realized what was really goin' on.  Everyone (so
it seemed to me) was respected for what they were instead of focus thrown
upon  what they weren't (so many different kinds of people!!). My petty
self consciousness was quickly elevated to a heightened sense of
awareness and I let go, let the music take me and understood. The music
by the way was excellent (really just on-point DJ's).  I'm an audiophile
and musician  at heart and I thought that any music could be understood
fully at home with a good pair of headphones (that's where a lot of it
begins of course) however my understanding of the music that all of us (I
assume) dig never entirely came to fruition until I saw what it does -
until I FELT IT IN ME.   I'm not a stupid person I know this is most
likely obvious to all y'all who frequent these things.  I just wanted to
share this experience (the ideals work people, really).  
Much Love to All For Hearing Me Out
-aeiou    
PS - I apologize for the convoluted thought patterns/poor grammar.  (it's
really late y'all :)

	Hey Y'all,
My friend is throwin' a DIY real soon and needs a sound system.  He
want's to try to get Wizard Workshop but does not know how to contact
them.  If anyone has any info  (about them or other good systems) it
would be much appreciated.  Also to any of y'all down with the 1.8.7...I
missed the video but I was wondering when and if it might air again and
where I might find info about the NASA "sighting" film.
Thanks all...
Take care

I don't know what the hell was up with MTV on Saturday, but I left my VCR
recording from 1:00-3:00 am Saturday, and all I found on the tape was a
blasted REAL WORLD LONDON marathon!

Whazzup with that?  I hope that it comes on next week, because the
video was even listed in the "amp" video list on mtv.online... 

Joe, if you're reading this; best of luck

Everyone who was at Tempatation! Thank you.
 
I did the live performance in the second room.  This was my first
experience with Pittsburgh and I had a great time.  

It was a last minute booking and almost didn't work out, but I am glad
that it did...special props to all those who made it happen.

If anyone is interested, I made a recording of the set and would be happy
to get it out...email me.

I'm not sure what the prob is.  It might be that you guys were watching @
2am on Sunday morning (Sat night) instead of 2am on Saturday morning (Fri
night).  I caught the video right near the beginning of the show,
sandwhiched between two other 'jungle' videos by Souslinger and Dj Dara.

While I love 187 live, prob more than any other techno act, it only made
me realize more than ever that techno just doesn't work on tv (unless you
have a boomin' system for you'r home-theater).  The sound just didn't have
the right dynamics comin' out of the TV speakers.  The video was alright,
although I'd like to have seen more party footage or maybe none at all, 
and less wham-bam cutting. Of course, its easy for me to criticize.

Of course i was swellin' with pride just to see 187 & MSKW's names up in
them beautiful cathode-ray lights. :)

l8s,
 cutup

Hello, east coast ravers!

I just wanted to introduce myself to all of you since I have just begin
listening in on your conversations!  I got really excited when I saw this
announcement about SPACE - you're going to love John Kelley if you don't
already!  (Has he been out there often?) He is one of my very favorite DJ's
from this area, and is always worth the 5 hour drive out into the depths of
the desert on a full moon.  It gives me the tingles just thinking about
those and other similar outdoor gatherings - I've never been able to say
that i could have found a better way to spend my time, and that's a tall
order for a workaholic like me.   

 I am originally from the Pittsburgh area, and a couple of years ago, moved
out here to endless the land of the endless summer, where I was first
introduced to the wonderful world of raving. All I can say is... YIPPEEE!
What wonderful loving friends I have been fortunate enough to make - I am
constantly overwhemed with all of the love I see around me, encompassing me
at events.  Surely this cannot be only a southern california phenomenon...
in the past few years,  I have been trying in vain to meet some of you, and
make more of a connection when I come back to visit.  Unfortunately, events
seem hard to come by out there, and I keep missing. It's so nice being here
and having one sure-to-be-fantastic event every weekend and at least 4 other
maybes - I am going to have a hard time ever deciding to leave - what do you
think of this? - would you rather have more events, or is it better that
you really have to take advantage of the ones you have?  Or am I completely
mistaken, and it is just more difficult to find out about all of the events
that take place in the area?   I am going to be in the area from December 16
to 26 this year, and it any of you have any leads for me, please drop me a
mail.  And so, dance on, my friends...

Yours in PLUR, Rebecca

> Damn-- will it run again?

It should next week.  honestly I don't know the amp schedule bexcause I
don't have cable and I generally don't understand television (I'm one of
THOSE people ;) but I think it's supposed to be on again, I'd assume the
next time it's on, be that next Friday night (sat morning) or Sat night
(Sunday morning). 

Someone may also have it taped.

hey guys, thanks for the support.  it's nice to turn one place at least
and not see "so-and-so's a sell out cuz they're actually making enough
loot to be a full time musician".  Nice to be amond people who actually
know what's up.

There's a rant behind that, but if I never finish writing it, that will
suffice.

ok, the deal is this: 
they have the new amp on friday night/sat morning at 2:00 am and then
that same episode on the saturday of the next week (meaning sat
night/sun morning, and the time for that is 1:00am)
so I assume that everyone will be able to catch the amp they missed next
saturday, or did I get the days mixed up? (saturday new, friday old?)
please correct me if I'm wrong.
thanx

hi:)
i'm making a black and white silent(cept basic soundtrack) film
in one scene of which, the main character is dancing at a rave-like thing
i was wondering if any of you had any ideas about how
i could visually Show him really enjoying the vibe and the beat,
with imagery from his thoughts and such.
if you've got any brilliant ideas,
you'd have my eternal gratitude=)

Actually, I'm sure if you ask around in the right circles, you'll find
that quite a few people have taped it.  I taped it, mskw1's friend out in
Iowa taped it, mskw1 taped it.  Yeah, let's get our hands on an editing
bay and start making copies.  I'll sell one for a small fee of $19.99.
heh heh.  And if you'll buy that, I have this really cool bridge I think
you'll like.  Anyway, it's entirely possible to get your hot little hands
on a tape if you really want.

Let's see... I didn't get to the party til real late around 2ish cause me
and my car were stuck in a ditch for an hr and a half... skidded out doin
55 on rt279 for those pgh heads that know the area the roads were a
nitemare and this patch looked dry... the black ice got the best of me
however. Luckily nuttin happened to the vehicle and I was fine, just a
little mud on the tires and an $80 tow. 

So arriving @ the party late had it's disadvantages... I got there as
jimmy van melleghem(SP) was playing and the crowd seemed sparse on the
main
room dance floor(Somewhat dissapointing) many people were bitching about
the chill due to lack of heat. Well all I hafta say about that is GET THE
FUCK UP AND DANCE!!! Don't bring my vibe down by whining and complaining
about 'it's too cold'. 

The 2nd room put together by Product 19 the main man behind House of
Styles productions (Tight events so far include BOUNCE and DYNAMO). The
vibe was slammin' or so I gathered from the amount of review I was getting
from the people dancing in the 2nd room. Body heat warmed up the room to a
nice comfortable temp for those who were on the chilly side. I was there
to catch the last half of Jay 'Dj Hazey's' rugged techstep/jumpup set.
Whoopin' and hollerin was in full effect. After Hazey, Dust started
playing and at the same time 4am dieselBoy went on in the main room the
vibe shifted from the 2nd room to the main room as Damian rocked the house
til the party was shut down at around 4:35am. 

The 5-0h were realitivly in the right as opposed to the wrong reasons to
shut it down. They had come 5 or six times during the evening to tell them
to turn it down but there was no cooperation from the promoters to do so.
I heard of some rumors that the promoter Devil Girl was not informed of
their repeated visits but I find that a little tough to swallow. 
Also the incident of the Pane of glass breaking in the 2nd room was not
due to shadiness or whatever. Some folks were leaning on it and it
cracked.
The owner of the space decided to break it out so that some unfortunate
person would not get seriously injured if it broke later in the evening...
good call by the mall. 

The party was fun while it lasted... propz to Devil Girl for giving it her
all. I'll see ya at the next PGH event.

Yes, the Saturday night/Sunday morning deal is what I'm talking about... I
started taping at 12:55 *last* saturday night/sun. morning (oops, I would
have missed it anyhow) and instead of AMP, it was all, as I said before a
Real World London marathon.

I wanted to see Joe, not Lars.

If you throw a hard party, you'd better do it while I'm in town or I'll be
forced to administer the beatdown..

I'm gonna bring old records and spin Tribute style... :)

Subject: Temtation review from a shady asshole

Hi,

	Ok, I was at the party on Saturday, and I'm the goddamned fool that broke the glass  
panel.  I'm c0mpletely sorry, but it was an accident.  Why the hell would I want to fuck up  
the vibe like that.  I'm sure you don't have any bad luck, and after all if it wasn't for me  
knowing your girl through a friend of mine, you wouldn't have gotten a ride home.  


	For the rest of you, here's the story.  I was chillin' in the second room and listenin' to  
Product 19, who was definitely cuttin' it up.  I had been doing some dancing and such, but  
one tends to get hot after a little while, so I decided I would sit down.  My friends were  
sitting along the glass, and I went over to sit down next to them.  I was turning around to sit  
down, and I stepped on the bottom of my pants, so I instead of sitting down began to fall  
backwards.  I tried to lean back over so I wouldn't hit the windows, but still my butt hit the  
glass at the bottom and it cracked.  I totally just tripped on my pants.  It's not like I was  
trying to break the damn thing.  I wasn't drinking or doing any drugs or any of that shit, so I  
just hope you can accept my apology for anyone whose evening it may have ruined.  The  
point is that shit happens, and this time it happened at the party to me, so just lay off.  


	Next time something happens like this, give the person a break because it could  
happen to you.  If you're still angry, I will personally apologize to anyone who would like to  
write me.  Oh, and Costas, I honestly mean no hard feelings through this post, I just  
wanted to defend myself.

This is not pertinent.  The Eastland Mall is the shit.  It has a store
called "TOTH'S CARPET MILL", I was going to steal the sign; but stealing is
bad.

Why would I defend an abandoned mall? :P  They should hold more there. But
not go so far as to announce it on the radio and turn it into a Club Zoo
type thing.  I was talking about my response when I said that the message
was not pertinent.  I dunno about the bust; I was only there for dynamo.

You never sound bitter.

Wait.  Is it really abandoned?

The list seems to be very busy so I chip in my 2 cents worth.

I would love a hard party, since this is also my favorite type to dance to.
I also agree with Christopher Newton in that I hope it all goes down 
before I leave town for Christmas Break also.  

Good Luck, 
troy (smooth)

Thanx so much for the help that some of you offered! but now it seems
the director's decided to take the film in a different direction, so
don't put further creative energy into it:( Hugz and smileys:) -tao

This isn't exactly rave-related, but I figured it was close so I'd do it
anyway.  I'm looking to head back to Los Angeles, I'm sorta from there,
since I'm making the plunge and starting grad school.  I've been on
NE-Raves for about two years now, and figured the best way to find a
like-minded person, and raver, would be to check around and see if anyone
on this list, and I'm checking a couple of other ones as well, is or knows
anyone who's planning on heading to LA, or the West Coast in general I
guess, in the next four weeks or so.  I figured that it could be a good way
to economize, share gas and driving etc., and thought the trek would be
more fun with a kindred soul, another raver.  If anyone's interested, or

Hello!

Well, thanks to everyone who wrote to me, and especially those kind souls
who offered to include me in their group of friends at a party when I swing
into town this december.  I knew that I had hit onto a good thing when I
chanced upon that interesting breed of human, the raver.  

Now I have an offer for a few of you.  I was listening to a mix tape by
Thomas Michael on my way to work this morning, and completely lost track of
time.  When I got to work, I was in utter disbelief that it really was only
a 10 minute drive.  I think I was transported out through a music induced
warp in space and time... Anyhow, my point is that none of you get to listen
to these great dj's whose music can always make me smile, and I don't get to
listen to the music of the dj's who do this for YOU!  SOOO, I would like to
offer a music tradeoff, my favorite mixtape for yours.  Let me expand on my
musical interests so that we are assured a good trade.  Mostly what I like
is melodic trance, or what some people call 'progressive' trance?  Hard
trance, psychedelic trance, and goa, these are all quite stimulating too...
Hmmm.  I hope this works.  If any of you are interested, drop me a note and
we can discuss the details.  

(Someone tell me if I am posting too much!  The Socal-raves mailing list
gets about 50 times as many posts as this one, and I am used to that mode of
operation being acceptable!)  

peace

It's great to see that Juan Atkins, perhaps the first and most formative
of all the Detroit techno dj's, is still around.  I thought that he had
gone into semi-retirement.

I wonder if he's going to be playing minimal Detroit techno for this party
"Clockwork" on Dec. 20 in Toronto or is he going to be playing house? 
The problem with some of these "old timers" (like Derrick May) is that
they've changed the style of music that they play.  Well, it's not really
a problem, but you want to hear them spin what they're known for -- or at
least I do.  I mean, if I saw Richie Hawtin and he was spinning jungle,
I'd be pissed off. 

Anyway, is Juan Atkins going to be spinning Detroit or what?

Braden,

Fortunately for all of us techno lovers, Juan Atkins has not retired
yet. He just seems to be playing much more in Europe and Japan, rather
than North America lately. 

	I did have a similar concern on what he is going to play. He
agreed to do a classic hard minimal techno set for us, even though the
old Chicago house is what most of the events he has been playing at have
requested from him. He was actually happy that someone still wants him
to play straight up, old school Cybotron time frame/style music. After
all, he invented that sound and is most known for it too. 

	Speaking of Richie Hawtin, I did see him for the 15th time on
Friday night at Ritual 1 in Toronto - 4.5 hour, 4 turntable "Historical
progression of techno" set. My 11 years of going to electronic events
just went down the drain. What he did was just amassing.

	I hope you'll make the trip to see and hear Juan. I don't think
you'll be disappointed with the experience.

	Regards,
	Viktor

what's up y'all?

...with all of this talk of throwing a hard rave (and yes, i think it is
a GREAT idea), i was wondering where you can even throw one in pittsburgh
anymore. the eastland mall is out of the question, but it might be
possible to move the main dancing area to the lower level of the eastland
mall (its underground, and i doubt the sound would travel very far). the
place where deep was is out of the question, because the owner wrote a
letter to editor saying that there were drugs there, and that he would
never allow another rave there. that tunnel where tunnel vision was is
out of the question :). i remember that there was some controversy over
that place where get down was (the g&k hall?). so what's left besides the
irish centre and club 168 (both of which most people are sick + tired
of!)? the only other spaces that i can think of are ardmore skating rink
+ the skating rink where feelin' lucky was. any ideas?

also - any news on the n.y.e. party in pittburgh?... a coupla months ago,
dj dan and dubtribe sound system were rumored, but i saw d.s.s. on
another n.y.e. flyer. any new info on that? is it actually gonna go down?

----------frankie g

ps - my post about temptation was way too negative! sorry, about that. i
had a much better time than my post implied, i was just swoll about it
shutting down right during dieselboy's set (matter of fact, i still am
swoll :).

HEY!!
	Who's tired of the Irish Centre!?  I love it!  I think I must have
gone to almost all the parties at the IC since I started raving.  Now it
does suck in the winter but in the summer, it rocks my world little
country girl!!!  I'm really not going to be much of a help thinking of a
good place in the winter; I think I'm a much better summer raver!!
Although I'm much against 'club raves', Laga has proven to be a great
dance space, perhaps out of desperation, it might be considered.  There's
a great place in Washington called Pancake Skate'n'Whirl.  They have bands
there and skaters(board and blade).  They have a snack shop and it's warm.
The guy who owns it had a silly thing he called a rave which was comprised
of a whole bunch of local teen bands all night.  He might be up for a
party if he could run a snack shop (LOTS OF CANDY).  I don't know.  
	I hate, with a passion, spaces that aren't heated.  I realize that
if you're cold, you should be dancing, but once I'm cold, I could be
sweating but I'm still cold to the touch.  It's very uncomfortable.
Besides the more you sweat the more water you can drink.  Yea water!!
Okay, I'm much too silly now.  Bye everyone!
						Your's coldly,
						Jenifer Foulmood

	Well, it's not that there isn't a better place to throw an event, it's
that every cool place we go ends up gettin all funcked up!  I'm not saying
that it's anyone person's fault (i.e. glass breakage).  Stupid things
happen because people don't think.  Awhile back, there was a really nifty
party at this place with balls and laser tag and generally cool stuff.  I
talked to the owner afterward and he said he never wanted to have us back
because of all the hassle we caused.  He only asked that we not smoke
in the building because there is always no smoking.  People ignored that
request all night.  As I recall, there was also a noise complaint, but it
was proven to the police that we were well within our decible level.
	A lot of places will not rent to us because they've seen bad press
or they don't want the noise or they don't want to stay up all night.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could just use abandoned warehouses.  Does
anyone know how to hook-up with an abandoned warehouse?  Huh, speak up
don't all talk at once.  Well, when the cops find people in abandoned
warehouses, the owners can have everyone caught in said warehouse
arrested for trespassing, vandalism, breaking and entering, etc.  And
while that may be exciting and all, I don't want to be arrested for
something dumb like going to a party.  I also don't consider it important
enough to protest.  People can do whatever they want with their private
property and I respect that even if what they do isn't what I want.
People in Pittsburgh are very protective of their warehouses.  Insurance
perhaps?  I don't know why.  Anyway, I think promoters are doing the best
with what they have and if anyone has a problem with that, why don't you
get your kicks out on the sidewalk and ears on the ringy-dingy and you
find a bass-kickin space.  I dare you.;p

but i don't think there's been an event held there for a while,
and i love the big warehouse-type space of it.

just an idea.

I realize I've responded to venue posts a lot, but well, I'm constantly
thinking wow this would be a great site, but....
	I agree that the Washington Co. Fairgrounds are really great spots
for parties (not to mention the fact that my house is 10 minutes away, as
well as an Eat'n'Park).  The only problem is in the winter.  The buildings
are not heated and even when there are a lot of people, because the
buildings are so big, there usually aren't enough people to warm it up.
Other wise the WCF is a perfect place, in fact, it's one of my favorite
places!

sound tech stuff is very rave related! keep it coming!  im not a gear head
but i am looking for used gear if anyone has any:
 casio fz-1 anybody?? ill pay $350.
  novation drumstation?
   anything ancient? post it!
    im looking for a sampler under $400; something to add to the
forthcoming JP-8000, rolands new solo synth, with dedicated knobs and
sliders all over the place for true analog real time tweaking.
i also look for stuff on harmony central, a very good place to buy and sell
equipment.

also you can look up Pro Sound and Stage Lighting on the net and they have
an 800 number to call if you want to order something on a credit card, and
they'll mach any price you get at a store.

btw. does anyone use Mark of the Unicorn Software? Digital Performer 2.11
upgrade comes with eVerb for free...its a visual reverb designing console
and you can use it in real time too!

I went to Roswell and saw the UFO flavor over there (not much), but ive
made some real connections (through a traveller) to people that claim to
have been negotiating with the Et's and the United Nations about what the
Et's plan on doing with the question of helping out our human population...
theres some messed up shit going on i tell you. the UN refuses to accept
any help even if it is confidential, but throughout 1998 and its been going
on already i think, the Et's are actually able to set up safe jackets of
land for people to transport from, even if temporarily... and guess what
intrigued me the most about this whole thing.. the aliens (through the
negotiator) said they would start sending their messeges through music at a
bounce rate of 120 BPM...precisely the speed at which we make commercial
sounding or otherwise denoted as house techno...most everything else is
faster.

We contacted the fellow who is been negotiating or at least has documents
portaining to the negotiations btween Nations and Extra Terrestials, and it
appears that i will be able to post some of these documents on the
internet. When we find out where they will be found, I shall relay that
message. Lord knows we shant change the speed of our music without
Federation Papers now.

 Don't worry about it we promoters are always gettin leads on new spaces
all you have to be concerned with is how you're gettin there and when
you're gettin' there. Space issues have always been a dilemma for me but
it always turns out good in the end.

Yeah I agree Irish Center is where i attended my second or 3rd party and
the vibe there is always slammin'. If you only knew the crazy shit we go
thru to find new spaces and secure them you would understand the value of
places like Irish Center. Hmmm Jen give me some more info on that skate
rink in Washington sounds intriguing.

Expomart if anyone has a spare 10-15 grand lying around I'd be happy to
rent that shit. Steel Mills are zoned for industry only and it'd have to
be on the super super DL if a party was to go on there. Schenly Park good
for day parties but the park closes by 11pm. Robert Morris is also pricey.
Panther Hollow many residential areas surrounding it. The basin would be
like a cannon and the sound would travel vertically to all the surrounding
houses.
 
Believe me it's not as easy as it seems

Given that pittsburgh is (or was) a city of industry, I'm suprised at
the lack of warehouse parties. Generally industrial districts don't
generate noise complaints, and owners of old warehouses are often quite
happy to make some cash off of their space. Anyone know of any good
warehouses?

The cops are totally rediculus at this place!!  I've been to 2 parties at
this place ( That thing, Delphi). And a mad amount of people got busted
there, And the line to get in were rediculus bcause they searched everyone
inside and out. And when someone gets busted it always brings the vibe down.

Anyone know about aquireing the Brewhouse as a venue for an event?
I know there was a party there before (this past summer), but I only heard

Well, not to get on a straightedge highhorse, but...
I don't think that doing drugs enhances a party.  I don't think that
people selling drugs enhances the vibe, nor do I believe that the people
buying the drugs enhances the vibe.  I do believe that if you want to do
them, it's your business, but you're taking your chances if you buy, sell,
and consume at a controlled party.  
I don't think it's people getting busted bringing the vibe down.  I think
it's one's state of mind at that point in time.  That Thing was my
absolute favorite party of all time.  I had the best time.  I saw almost
every single raver friend I have.  I danced all night.  The sky was
gorgeous.  I made a new friend.  I think it just depends on your
perspective.

Hey dont get me wrong I'm totally down with people who dont do drugs but
there are a lot of us who do. I must say that That Thing was the bomb I had
a great time but did you or did you not get hasseled all night long? I did.

Explain how people doing drugs enhances raves.  Are you saying if nobody
did drugs, there wouldn't be anybody dancing or letting loose?  You
aught to try that without drugs!  A challenge not many people can take.

I have went to many a party with out doing drugs and had a great time Im not
saying you cant rave without them. You may be binded to the fact but no
matter what anyone says drugs are a big part of the rave scene and always
will be.
By the way Im not trying to start a war or any thing but I personally dont
see a problem with people that can handle drugs doing them.
Moderation is the key.

Not to beat an old argument to death after it already died and rose from
the dead and then got beat to death again...BUT:

I think what enhances/makes a great vibe is people enjoying themselves,
being themselves and generally acting friendly and crazy...

If drugs help people do this, then I'm like "yeah!", otherwise I'm like

I agree with the whole Irish Center thing, because I love it there too,
but the thing to consider is that a lot of people don't like it there.

About Washington County Fairgrounds: I personaly don't like this place
very much for a few reasons.  1) the big space is too big 2) the floors
are cement, which I don't like dancing on 3) its not very convenient and
4) the whole heat thing

And in regards to the drug busts there, in case anybody didn't check the
N'Sync infoline after Journey to Delphi, the busts/confiscations that
were going on there were done by average people pretending to be cops!! 
I don't know how they got away with it, but they did.  However did that
must have been happy.

i couldn't agree more.  if people are having fun, the vibe will be
positive.  it don't matter to me what makes them have fun, as
long as they are having fun.  the only problem i see with drugs
at parties is when people take drugs then go sit against a wall,
or stand around on the dance floor.  drugs can also kill the
vibe.  

love,
ryu

if you take the 91 from downtown to Etna there are a gazillion empty
warehouses. In Etna there are a couple abandon buildings dying for some
kind of event. I havent noticed anything in pittsburgh lately other than
these.. Quality Rolls on the South side would be THE perfect venue but
unfortunately, they are still making money manufacturing aluminum or
whatever. maybe we should start to boycott this product using our fine
promotional skills and hope they go out of business. then we can make it
very easy for  people to feel comfortable at a pittsburgh party.. hehhe
they said rolls..

no one does.. the security at That Thing was very tight and i know people
that got busted there but still Holdsome came out okay... think about it
man, if youre throwing a large event with lots of kids you have to search
people and maybe even hire some security to do this. if not then you would
be responsible for all the kids that got busted on your lease. you cant be
everything to everyone as a host to 1000 kids, even if the cops dont show
up. what if they do? then youre liable..
as it pans out, they DO show up to parties promoted as heavily and broadly
as THAt thing, Planet Orange, Delphi, Deep... if your throwing a tight
event tahts one thing... when your throwing a 'rave" in pittsburgh the cops
will definately show.. and once they show they stay until they find
something to say youre doing wrong.. Electric Kingdom...

hiding?  i think not.
in fact, i can half the time agree with you,
but then again the other half the time disagree.
it all depends on the people's reasoning for taking the
drugs, and what they do once they got them in their
system.  there are people who just go mad nuts on teh
dance floor and are smilin' and just bleeding positivity.
they are helpful to me.  then there are others who just
go to get drugs, don't care about anyone else, find themselves
puking in a bathroom, bring suspician, clog up the people
trying to dance, form bumps along the walls, etc....
they are a waste.

love,
ryu

Okay folks time to step back, take a breath, and chill.  I think we can
all agree that drugs are definitely in the scene, most likely to stay.  I
think we can all agree to disagree on the degree of the good and bad
effects drugs have on the scene (say that five times fast and I'll give
you a hug).  We have all had experiences with drugs influencing our
present opinions.  I think we're all so up in arms, we've forgotten the
most basic skills of the english language, like spelling and grammar,
which is understandable because we're all so flustered.  It's okay
everybody, as the world turns, so do our social lives.  Rock on.

hanover/dublin.  space is white warehouse on the left.  park in the rear.

Did anyone see Much Music late last night or early this morning?  They
showed Tribal Gatherings live.  It was pretty cool.  Orbital, Faithless,
Sneaker Pimps, Sven Vath and many other big names were there.  You don't
see much stuff like that on tv, especially never on Mtv.  I'm leaning
more toward Much Music than Mtv.  They'll have some decent shows on once
in awhile.

Peace
Matthew

i saw it... does anyone have any idea what festival they were showing... my
fave part were those funky condoms on stilts and the alien with the big
pants (dressed all in white) ... i wish shit like that would happen in the
states.. sadly, funky dressing seems like its fround uppon here in the
states... what a shame... it would be so fucking increadible if people
dressed up in funky ways to go to thes parties... and the music was good
too... juts immagine the possibilities if an event like that happennedhere
in the states.

Your Welcome, although i may not be sXe, or maybe i am and just don't
know it.  People who do drugs don't bother me, but i think the best time

all i know is that i was at delphi, and i wasn't on drugs, and i DID get
harrassed by the police. i agree that the bad vibe is created by the
people, not the drugs, but there wouldn't have been any cops there if it
weren't for the drugs. i talked to the head policeman and he told me that
they weren't there to harrass anyone, but the undercover police were
making the on duty ones bust people. you can, and will, think what you
want...

Yeah it was pretty sweet.  I watched it at night and when i woke up and
turned the tv on, it was on again!  I wish i could have been there too.
It was like Lollapalooza for techno.  I'm not sure what it was, but i'm
pretty sure they showed Perry Ferrel, so i don't know festivals he put
on besides enit.  

Later Jess,

Good evening folks - 

I was just thinking about why I rave, or more exactly, why I am not out
tonight even though most of my friends are on their way to the middle of the
desert and I am sitting in work, wanting to be productive, but instead
thinking about why I rave, or more exactly... (you get the picture)

Well, I hesitate to say I rave purely for fun, and often hesitate to call
what I do 'partying'.  Why should this be?  To have the best time possible,
I have to either 1) have something in my life which I want to celebrate or
2) have something in my life which I need to think about and resolve.  

Yes!  The music is a joy to be immersed in, the people are constantly
feeding me strong positive energy but, yippee, when I thought about having
passed a qualifying exam for my degree, that was even better!  I could smile
all night and just go higher and higher...  Someday maybe I'll get to the
point that I can just celebrate life in general, and feel that this is a
worthy cause and one I can flourish in all night.  I feel that trying to
resolve 'problems' in my life is quite productive in the positive mind frame
I enter at raves too.  

Is this all crazy?!  I'd like to hear more about why YOU rave, dear reader,
and what you get out of it.  Please feed me some good thoughts as I sit here
being (uggh) productive.  Plus, there is always next week - it seems so far
away!!! (Don't feel too bad for me - I'm going to see Eat Static on Wed
night - have you all heard of them? - they do really good stuff.)

with love, Rebecca

Cool idea for a thread.  I think the posts on the drug issue tie into this
pretty well.  I think most people need to distinguish between taking
drugs as part of raves or going to raves as part of taking drugs.  I can
understand popping an E or smoking some weed to feel the music more or be
able to dance all night.  I just end up worrying about people who seem
drugged up to the point of losing consciousness (haven't seen much of this
though).

As for me, I think dancing has a lot to do with my reasons for raving.  I
always went dancing with my friends back home but it was always at 
eurodance or hiphop clubs.  I never felt comfertable gyrating my hips with
a girl or learning the latest pop dance steps.  When I finally went to a
techno club everyone seem to just be moving to the music rather than
fallowing some regimented steps or trying to hook up.  Soon I found myself
becoming comfertable dancing in my own crazy way and started actually
enjoying it.  This created a crazy newfound unity with my friends too.
We'd go and dance until 4 am and whenever we met on the dancefloor or off
it we'd always share those memories of dancing into exhaustion at 4am
without worrying about school, politics or relationships.  I guess dancing
is just letting down my hair for me and not worrying about what anyone
thinks.  Met some wonderful new friends too.  I must say I kinda wonder
about those who deny that such a thing as PLUR actually exists and makes a
difference.  I feel such comfort and peace at a rave and such love for
those I rave with and those I meet that I can't doubt that it is such a
positive force at raves.  My only sort of religion if you will.

Well, I've rambled enough.  Love to hear other people's reasons for
raving.

Peace,
JP

P.S.  On the venue tip, how about some more events at graffiti!  This
venue kicks ass and someone mentioned that they were very interested in
having some more electronic related stuff after that awesome Crystal
Method/187 show (damn that was cool).

I agree with this completely.  And the main reason I don't like alcohol
served at a good event is that it attracts frat boys and their
cheerleading honeys.  There is nothing worse than a whole bunch of big
drunk guys wobbling around with girls on their arms making fun of the way
everybody is dancing.  This situation is just asking for something bad to
happen, and although I've never seen something bad (a fight, brawl
whatever) occur, I'm sure they have.  

Also, alcohol just doesn't mix well with precise, computer created music
(IMHO).

A big thanks goes out to all the people who attended the Fall Classic.
You people know how to kick a VIBE!!!
I haven't felt a vibe like that at any party since Rebirth 1, four years ago!!
Also, to all the people that helped in any way, THANK YOU!!
It wouldn't have worked with out you!

The party was completely a success, from the music to the dancing to the
friendly faces. Total attendance was just over 600 people. (600 insane
dancing people!!) Every Dj last night was tight, and kept the groove
THICK!! The dance floor was SICK!!!
So once again  Thanks Thanks Thanks!!

Watch for the WINTER CLASSIC!!!

PS: One small downside note, (no dis-respect to Joe 187,"love ya Joe") but
who ever the fool is who tags 187 on everything I will find you and tatoo
your tag on your face!!! I promise!!
Thanks to everyone again!
Peace & respects,

This discussion reminds me of one of the times that the socal raves listers
organized a party.  We were up in the mountains, sort of deserty like area,
and very beautiful... and at about 2am a gang of 'really big guys' came into
the area.  They were, um, big guys, wearing jeans and  flannel, big ole
boots and smelling a whole lot like a brewery.  They had obviously been
camping nearby and were attracted by all of the commotion.  I was in the
back dancing when they came up, and they didn't seem to be bothering anyone,
but were quite interested, and so everyone let them be, just standing there
sort of trying to take it all in.  It was  funny.  "Hey, man, what's
happening here?  I've never seen dancing like this - hey, the girls are
dancing next to other girls.  Wow, man...." They stood there and waved their
flashlights for a while then stumbled back off into the darkness.  Well, we
hoped we made a good impression, that's all.  
 How about a rave on the Gateway Clipper!  Whee!  (has this been done?)

...so i was having an arguement with my ex-girlfriend, christa,
about getting my vcr back, not only is she not returning it,
but claimed it as part of 'indian giving'...

aside from the extremely self-centered and materialistic source
of the remark, i thought the statement was not only racist but 
completely inane...apparently 'indian giving' means giving and expecting 
nothing back...the more i thought about this, the more wack i thought
this was especially with Thanksgiving coming up...

what is Thanksgiving really about?

it's because approximately 500 years ago some of our fore-fathers 
(not mine), came to this land and basically violently took over this
land from the native american indians...many were mindlessly 
slaughtered as they were forced futher and further west...and
today occupy areas when all put together is substantially less than
even the state of Texas...

so this weekend when u go home and see all the relatives and start
devouring that generous chunk of turkey of that $100 seven course
meal, start giving thanks, to the people who really deserve it...
all the Native Americans that gave their LIVES and their LAND so you 
could stare at your $1000 computers, riding your $20,000 cars (which 
your parents most prolly paid for), going to $20 partys, wearing your 
$100 outfits, popping your $30 pills, watching dj's spin records @ $10 
a piece, standing in front of $50,000 sound and light systems...

"indian giving"...yeah right...

>what is Thanksgiving really about?

it's a holliday made up by white folk to justify
their wrong doings by stealing land from the 
native americans.  it's trash.  probably wasn't
invented until like the 18th century...long after
it supposedly took place.

What's up? This is in reponse to the post about thanksgiving and "Indian
Giving." First off, I would like to address the topic of "Indian Giving." The
term means when someone gives someone else something, and then asks or demannds
it back. But as far as racism goes, I'm sure at first it had a racist meaning
but over time it lost it's racial meaning and aquired a new one. Same with
saying, "I jewed that guy down!" meaning that you got the price down or didn't
pay him as much as he was asking. I personally use both, and I'm not racist.
Because over time they have lost their literal meaning. And plus the fact that
they are only words like, "nigger," "spick," "wap," whatever, it's the racist
bastard that uses them that has the problem, not the word itself. Think about
it!!
As for the thanksgiving holiday, it is to celebrate the arrival of the
pilgrims, and how they survived horrible conditions to get here. Columbus Day
is the absurd holiday that celebrates the "discovery" of America and the
slaughtering of all the Indians. This is the bogus holiday that should not be
celebrated. But I personally have no problems with coming home from college,
living off of the shit they call food here, and mowing down on a fat plate of
the best food my grandma works on all day to cook for us. If you don't want to
participate in eating, than don't. But just like any other holiday, it has lost
it's true meaning and become commercialized like anything else, just enjoy it
and move on! 
until next time...
peace. bri@n

reading all these messages about venues made me remember that there are
a couple of empty warehouses + some various other empty bldgs here in
kent. most of them are in industrial districts too. this 1 warehouse is
HUGE and looks brand new, + has a "for rent" type of sign in front of it,
although i'm not sure about what the inside is like. anyway (unless every
one of the people owning these bldgs or any other empty warehouse in the
area is against the idea of letting a party happen there) there is no
excuse for holding a party in the akron area in some tired old club or
something, who the hell wants that? you can dance in a club any day. i
just needed to say there seems to be a shortage of parties in good venues
around akron lately (well for the past year + a half or so). e-mail me if
you want me to tell you where these warehouses are.

WHOA!
I was watching this one from the start.  First off, I totally agree with
the original post.  Thanksgiving is a hoax.  Its a sick holiday.  Although
the pilgrims did survive a horrible winter and found a "new world", they
stabbed the people that helped them in the back a few years later. (Look
it up).  Their descendants slaughtered thousands of people out of
selfishness and greed.  The whole things was a horrible holocaust (one of
7 noted holocausts which also include Jews and enslaved Africans).  To
celebrats such a thing is hideous.

Now, I dont condemn going home to be with your family  and indulge in your
granny's cooking, but not for the purpose of celebrating Thanksgiving. I
think that people should give thanks to those who suffered for what we
enjoy.  We should commemorate those who died, and act accordingly.  IT
should be more like Memorial Day.

Oh, and by the way, no matter how old a term/phrase is, some people dont
forget.  Im sure jewish people dont like the "jewed down" thing, and I
dont think native american indians take kindly to the phrase "indian
giving."  Its just plain racist.  As are "black-balling", "kifing", saying
"thats so gay".  Althought they are just words, they have a definite,
negative connotation.  People are hurt by them, and that should be enough
to keep others from using them.  What kind of vibe do you think occurs
when people use these kinds of phrases?

This isnt a personal attack, but history proves contrary to this post.

Now from "Space-Age" technology...

                   ...Comes a profound benefit for mankind.

PLEASE PRINT THIS FORM

A REVOLUTIONARY NEW
 
              PATENTED FUEL SAVING DEVICE

                                    THAT IS 100% GUARANTEED


After nearly a decade of research with technology that
originated at N.A.S.A., extensive lab and field testing
by American Universities, and independent laboratory 
investigation, Dr. Ivo E. Pera, World Renowned Scientist
and founder of International BioSearch Laboratories, Inc.,
has created the GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device.


Scientific research has long sought an efficient application
in using magnetic energy to produce power. The forces of 
magnetism are now powerfully at work in many industries from 
transportation to space exploration. The GasAtomic {TM} Fuel 
Saving Device is the perfected result of this successfully 
applied science and the realization of many years of research 
and Space-Age technology.


The GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device uses advanced magnetic 
technology to create a more complete and efficient combustion 
in hydro-carbon fuel engines (gasoline & diesel fuel), thus 
producing more power, better mileage, fewer engine deposits, 
and ultimately - less pollution. The principle of the GasAtomic 
{TM} Fuel Saving Device involves the realignment of fuel 
molecules. Previously scattered and unorganized molecules of 
fuel (wasted) now go through an alignment process of multi-
magnetic fields of reverse polarity, which permits the more 
efficient blending of fuel and oxygen. The realigned fuel 
molecules improve atomization and increase engine power. The 
resulting increased mileage and fuel consumption savings are 
truly amazing!


Dr. Pera, a native of  Italy, is perhaps the most versatile 
Scientist and Researcher in the field of Physics and Chemistry. 
He has devoted many years of his BioChemical research to 
perfecting the GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device, which has 
produced exciting additional results beyond simply saving money 
on fuel consumption. The more efficient combustion generated by 
the GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device's intense magnetic fields 
causes more of your fuel to be burned (less wasted out of your 
exhaust pipe), and your fuel is burned cleaner with fewer engine 
deposits, resulting in less pollution and a healthier environment.


Dr. Pera has developed over fifty inventions to benefit mankind. 
This modern day Leonardo Da Vinci's work has been featured in 
N.A.S.A. annual series publications numerous times, and products 
derived from his inventions are used by astronauts in space to 
reprocess polluted water. The original prototype of the GasAtomic 
{TM} Fuel Saving Device has been put on permanent display by 
N.A.S.A. at the Kennedy Space Center along with six of Dr. Pera's 
other inventions - a distinction that few scientists have been 
awarded.


The GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device is now available directly 
from the inventor for a limited time through this special 
"PRE-RETAIL" price offer. By ordering your GasAtomic {TM} Fuel 
Saving Device direct from the laboratory (before it goes into
retail stores) you can save an incredible 50% off the suggested 
retail price.

The GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device is 100% guaranteed to 
consistently save you a minimum of 8% off your total fuel 
consumption expenses. (Instructions for monitoring your fuel 
savings are included in your order). Your actual results may 
be even better based upon equipment, travel conditions, and 
driving habits. Satisfied individuals and corporations alike 
are reporting savings in the 12% - 18% range, but again we 
guarantee a consistent minimum savings of 8%. The GasAtomic {TM} 
Fuel Saving Device is a safe and effective product that installs 
easily on any vehicle that uses gasoline or diesel fuel. The 
device simply snaps around the outside of your fuel line. Product 
instructions should enable anyone to put the GasAtomic {TM} Fuel 
Saving Device on their cars and trucks in just minutes with no 
tools or mechanic required.


The GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device is a true "Space-Age" 
miracle product that is going to take the transportation industry 
by storm once it is released to retailers. Forecasters predict 
that we'll see the GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device being sold 
on TV for 5 times the price of this offer. Now is the time to get 
your GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device, direct from the inventor 
before this revolutionary money-saving product explodes onto the 
market at higher prices. The GasAtomic {TM} Fuel Saving Device 
will literally be paying for itself each time you fill up your 
fuel tank, and the savings $$$ go directly into your pocket - 
right there at the pump! The oil companies are probably going to 
hate us, but DON'T LET THEM HOSE YOU!!!

hey look....

i'm signing off this list for a while.  i won't be hard to 
find for those who know me (or anyone who cares).

i'm getting too busy and the s/n here is a little whack.

and thanksgiving is supposed to be about giving thanks to 
God for the opportunity to experience life and to do so 
with such abundance and fruition. ya'll pinkos need to get 
a one-way international airline ticket.  i'm no 
dixie-flag-wavin die-hard american nationalist 
american-by-birth-southern-by-the-grace'a-god kinda guy, 
but i'm more than a little offended by the ungratefulness 
i've read off of this list the last couple of days.  i know 
this is straying far and wide from the original 
thanksgiving topic, but some'a ya'll need to go see the 
world...and learn how good you've got it.

oh well...people never change.  right stevie?

yeah...
all this is really wack (and saddening) I thought I had found a place
away from all that mess but I guess not even the best of peoples are
impervious to the forces of wackness and bitchery...I personally don't
have a problem with thanksgiving (or most any other holiday for that
matter).  Now as I get older it's meaning changes for me.  This holiday
for me is maybe one of the better ones.  It's a time when I can  see my
brother and relatives and generally have one relaxing day of leisure with
them.  In short I think it's more about spending time with the people you
are thankful to have in your life.  This aint a partisan issue Y'all!! 
Tracing back the roots of one holiday is not only innane but

You make some good points here J, I agree things EVOLVE and should evolve. 
(for me this is a big part of rave culture)

Sure, I can agree that it's good to be thankful for what we have in such
a stupid world.  I enjoy Thanksgiving even though I know what the
'pilgrims' really did to the 'indians', because it has that different
meaning to me.  But I understand why people hate thanksgiving, or feel
that it's based on BS.  I have to agree there.

While we can and should  evolve and move on, we can't forget the past.

Oddly enough (i'd even say 'ironically' if i was alanis), this is a pretty
good parallel to the problems i see with the rave scene.  We do understand
evolution pretty well as a whole, but as a whole we're forgetting the past
too quickly.  

How come there aren't any $5 raves anymore?

Anyway, everyone at least enjoy a say off of school.  

Who's going to T-Day? 
(this weekend + its only $7! if you don't know bout' 
 check house of styles infoline)

Damn, I'm jumpin' all over the place. :)

I know that the Thanksgiving thing has been unanimously attacked by
everyone who responded to Stevie's original post, but I have to give my
support for the holiday.  Very briefly, here's why:

1) THE INITIATION

None of us here with any sensitivity likes the idea of slaughtering
people.  There is no doubt that countless thousands of Native Americans
were butchered by the Europeans who came here.  But Thanksgiving was about
peace, not war.  It was about coming together to overcome differences and
about sharing the wealth of the land, if only for a day.

2) THE PERPETUATION

Today, the holiday is about giving thanks for all the wonderful things we
have (and usually take forgranted).  One of those things, at least for me,
is the whole techno/rave culture.  I've been going to parties since 1988
and have stayed with the music and the scene since that time.  And despite
all the changes and grumblings about this or that, there is no doubt in my
mind that we have something special here.  I used to believe that I would
have been happier as a young person in the 60's.  Well, I now firmly
believe that this is the best time to be young!  The music of the 90's,
particularly the trance/techno/jungle/acid/trip hop of the underground, is
the best music I know of.  And I wouldn't want it any other way.  The
parties seem to be getting better each week with better lighting and
better visuals and better dj's . . . yes, there is a lot to be thankful
for.  I'm just glad I've been around to experience this great, ever
evolving scene.

Braden

I live there.  I'm not doing any partying or clubbing and I haven't kept
up very well on parties and events.

As far as record stores, go to About The Beat on Pine Sterrt between 11th
and 12th.  The personel are very nice and the selection is decent.  They
are also good people.  Their specialties are house, gay house, and the
club scene in general.  Ask for Lorne and tell him I sent you there.  They
are a good resource for cluing one in on the club scene which is probably
the most alive underground scene in Philly.

Everyone and their brother will tell you to go to 611.  I *ABHOR* 611.  I
won't go there unless coerced.  The selection is different, not better,
the prices are a little cheaper (like 40 or 50 cents), the staff are
snobbish, condescending and nasty, the good jungle is kept on a wall high
above the counter people's heads, and the listening stations are shitty. 
They have a lot of ridiuclously over-priced and therefore OLD "clubwear"
if you're into that sort of thing.  I would go there to pick up fliers and
that's about it.  But keep in mind that the only fliers you'll see are
those thrown by people who are "down" with the management.  They emphasize
"rave" type events--in a city where real raving doesn't exist.  This is my
politically charged rant for the day.  Believe my propaganda at your own
risk.

Have fun in the city of brotherly love!!!

love,
stephanie

Like Geoff said, this subject has been beaten to death and reincarnated so
many times it must be near nirvana BUT Every time it comes up it seems to
get further from the attitutde that I think was originally taken about the
whole thing. 

In the beginning, Nancy Reagan had taught all good 8th graders to SAY
!NO! TO DRUGS! Then when they became 9th graders many of them realized
that if they smoked a little herb they didn't go into convulsions and die.
Then wonderful extrapolation happened:  People started to realize, hey,
maybe there's more to this moral paradigm thing than meets the eye.  maybe
i should question authority, who have obviously been paranoi-ically lying
to me about these drugs, ... and maybe I should even question my own
perception of reality.

And people tried things like funny clothes, crazy dances, hugging each
other, communal attitudes, and altered states. 
And they discovered things.
And it was good.
Then someone had a bad trip.

Fast forward to now and the rave scene that fostered this experimentation
has had a uniform for years and the most significant change to it has been
the brand name emblazoned across the front.  The Question Everything issue
has boiled down to a rather dull Do Your Drugs Responsibly issue.  It's
becaome so dull I doubt that even the narcs hired by The Man to monitor
lists like this for tip-offs are all that interested.

There is a need--let me say that again--a NEED to "do your drugs
responsibly" because drugs at parties isn't exactly something new and
unheard of. However, what's still much more important to me is the
yearning for discovery and testing the bounds that was the foundation for
all of this in the first place.  If a subculture isn't subversive in some
way, doesn't challenge conventional wisdom, doesn't push forward to test
rules and even break its own, well, Pppfffftt!  Why bother? 

I like the Washington County fairgrounds.  But it is COLD!!!!

love,
Stephanie FoulMouth    ;)

Woo hoo!  I just got Future Listening back from my deadbeat roommate!
What other solo stuff does he have, if I may be so bold as to ask before
looking at the page?  Truly, truly excellent music.

I have a new mixtape available:

cat#:  dd13
name:  "Level 1"

Description:  Recent/new minimal and hard techno, mixed down to a DAT, and
professionally duplicated for your pleasure.  Almost all european releases,
with the exception of one US effort.  Hovers around 145bpm, doesn't really
let up.. pounding hard dark metallic, but still minimal where you can hear
all the elements and pick them out at your discretion and select which
elements you choose to groove with.

This mix is pretty dark, but it should get the most jaded listener going.
Featured labels:  ecom, drumcode, prhythm, absense, thrust, construct
rhythm, jerk, blueprint.

de und se im haus.

Outsoon:  "Level 2"  -  an experimental and extremely minimal/ambient
approach to techno.

there is still some pretty good shit out there.  you can go out hunting for
it yourself, or let me do the work and just get "Level 1" and hear it all
in one neat little package, in a seamless mix.

I ask $10 (includes shipping) for a mail-ordered tape.  Includes full color
JCard and designed laser labels.  Email for more info, or just check out
webpage below.

hey Stephanie,

	Towa has a bunch of other solo stuff.  I think 2 other complete
albums.  I'm not sure if they're released in the u.s.  I'm following all
the members from the former Deee-Lite, since i'm a huge fan.  I'm so mad
at myself for missing Lady Miss Kier at U4ia, if anyone went, please
tell me about it.  Look at the page, cuz i got all my information from
there, so i don't want to spoil it.  He has some kick ass T-shirts,
that'd i'd love to get ahold of!!

Matthew

Hey, what's up ya'll?

Does anyone know what going down with T-Day?  The infoline according to
the post on this list was 734-8427 (the house of styles infoline), but
the same message is on there that has been there for the last week or so.
 It mentions that t-day is happening, but no more info or directions. 
That is kind of strange considering it will being in less than nine
hours.  

Oh well, hope someone knows what's up,

ABSOLUT

:..[I was at U4ia wednesday night.  It took a while for the vibe to kick
in, but when Lady Miss Kier came on, the place was bumpin'.  She was
spinning some phat drum n' bass.  I'm still recovering my hearing.  I
left around 4 Am and the place was still crazy. I dunno about the first
DJ though, I was never one for diva house.  

It's too bad you missed it.  Lady Miss Kier was spinning, singing and
dancing, and did I say that she looked fine?  Damn.  Well worth the ten
bucks I payed.]

Shoot! I will be going to this. Why didn't I think to post it earlier,
cause I'm not going to be able to check my mail later to find out about
the AOL net meet or any MW-Raves one. So any of y'all that care, you
will have to look for me and I'll hope to run into some of you!

I will, once again, be recognizeable by my mutant ninja turles backpack,
topped by the flashing red light. It is usally on me or near me on the
floor when I'm dancing. Unless it's super loud, I'm usually by one of
the speakers. I have short blond hair and I'm a short, petite little
girlie. Most likely will be wearing a red addidas soccer shirt. 

I might even have copies of the third issue of High-R Frequencies to
hand out. so look for me and definitely don't be affraid to say hi if
you see me. Would love to meet any of you!

(Jenn, if you get this, look for me at the party if you go!)

See you all soon!

I picked up a Technics SL-23 belt-drive deck at a garage sale over the
summer and I'm wondering if anyone knows where I should be a
needle/cartridge for it?  This is not something I know a lot about so
any info you can give me would be appreciated.  Also, the drive itself
doesn't start very quickly so do I need a new belt too?  Help!

Bahhhh! Change of plans! My friend that was going to help me drive to
get freaky is sick and i can't drive that far (12 hours) and back by
myself, and still get up Monday morning. 

Have a friend that wants to go to Emerald City, though, so looks like
that's where I'll be this Sat. eve. That's only an eight hour drive. 

Both are going to be GREAT parties, but I'll be sorry to miss seing all
my Ohio and Kentucky friends. :-(  Have a good time, guys! Maybe I can
make it to Cinci for New Years. 

Anyone going to Emeral City, look for me and come up and say hi. I'll
try to make the net meet. Better dig those emails out of my delete box
now, huh? ;->

Rock on! See yall soon -- somewhere!

<HTML><PRE>Hello,

          Back in March, I sent out an email message entitled "The Lowdown on
Saddam Hussein," which contained predictions of the outcome of the conflict
between Iraq and the U.N.  That message was sent to just over a quarter
million people.  In September, I contacted 1.2 million more.  Right now, over
this Thanksgiving weekend, I'm reaching out to another eight hundred
thousand.  In this "everyone for himself" world, it seems a little strange
when someone comes along who cares about other people enough to do what I'm
doing.

          I understand the future though, and one thing I see clearly is that
we are all about to become lost when the way seemed clear, and the authority
figures we've depended on will become unreliable.  That means people will
have no choice but to turn to one another and work in cooperation toward
survival, independently of the government.  That's essentially what I'm doing
as I go about contacting people ahead of time:  I'm gathering witnesses to my
predictive abilities because I know that there will be a way out when things
get completely unbearable.  But the only way I can explain the way out is if
I attract plenty of attention first.

          On December 13th, Pope John Paul II should be assassinated because
of a Moslem invasion of Rome.  The Christian law will be held as the enemy as
the entire Arab world rises up against the western countries in protest of
the U.N.'s treatment of Iraq.  Iraq will go to war with Iran again, as a rain
of meteorites from the comet hits the earth in the area of Italy, Greece and
the Red Sea, sometime in the January/February period.  By the end of April,
the entire Middle East is in turmoil as God's people flee for their lives.
 Also, a little while prior to this, the Mediterranean coast will be
surrendered to looting and public money will be plundered by land and sea.
 Neither churches nor sexes will be spared.  Woe to the Italians...

          The whole ordeal lasts for 3 1/2 years, and will rapidly become a
very tight squeeze for humanity as a whole.  As I said though, there will be
a way out, so if you become concerned and decide that you want to learn more,
then go to this web site:  

 <A HREF="http://www.masterserver.com/home.htm">COUNTDOWN TO APOCALYPSE Site
#1</A>

          This is the only time I will be able to contact you, so go ahead
and take a look at the web site and bookmark the home page so you'll be able
to go back to it later.  I really think you'll be glad you did.

          Thank you for reading this...

Sincerely, 
Robert Hayes
