Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Ah yes, gotta love quantum mechanics.  It's been a long time since 
i've seen the schroedinger equation (ok fine, a year or so).  I think 
sound really is a continuous system.  compression of particles in 
patterns producing a wave.  hmm but then again... nice... is a stream 
of particles really continuous.  this MAY be getting too deep for the 
list here!

Does digital image manipulation take anything away from painting?

The medium is far less important than the artist.

I agree. They both add their own special kinds of distortion.

When I'm saying 'leaving out the things we ignore', I mean leaving out
the things that will be ignored because of the way our brains and ears
are wired, not things that we choose to ignore.

  I agree. They both add their own special kinds of distortion.

  When I'm saying 'leaving out the things we ignore', I mean leaving out
  the things that will be ignored because of the way our brains and ears
  are wired, not things that we choose to ignore.


I knew what you meant here.  Things that you are hardwired to ignore, =
but can be trained to understand.  :)

  What do you mean?

People see the obvious and make assumptions, and don't seek out the =
details of what makes something special or unique.  The whole concept of =
"that certain je ne sais quois" has been lost.  It means too many people =

>>Does digital image manipulation take anything away from  painting?
The medium is far less important than the  artist.<<<
 
I dunno,  I have wanted to paint traditionally for years.  I know  a 
painter/artist
and respect him and his work far more than anything I, or anyone else has  
done in Photoshop.  Especially because his work is great and he actually  makes 
a living with it.  Photoshop and the like are just too  easy.  Its cheap, its 
free, and takes little time to learn.
 
For instance, my father (was) a commercial/traditional airbrush artist that 
did some ad work.  Photoshop comes along, he learns it to a tee, and  is 
bumped out
of his business by young, dumb, straight-out-of-college green ones who work 
for pennies on the dollar.
 
I can see the same happen to vinyl DJs in the future.
Young, dumb, don't-know-any-better, than to download a bunch of mp3s
and spin cd-djs break through the wedding market and take over the 
oh so fun super clubs.
 
Its the dismantling of life and culture as we know it.  I love the  future.
We can all stand around a stage with a computer on it playing  tracktor.
Hell, just put a carousel cd player up there and hit the shuffle  button.
Make mine a bud light.

By the above definition I would say with a high level

audiophiles... my days of working in the recording
studio are long behind me so perhaps my interest is no
longer 'ardent'... my point is that I have to
respectfully disagree with Ratana on this.

This pretty much sums up the way things are going on
this island... all art forms - music, painting,
sculpting, writing, street performing, etc. are dying
right in front of us here as this place is being
converted into million dollar condos. The people who
are taking over KW are systematically dimantling it's
culture. It's not a technology thing... but it is
still the same sad stifling of art and creativity. I
guarantee the same thing will happen on an epic scale
in New Orleans when it is rebuilt.

aac isn't loss-less, they have something else called "apple loss-less  
codec" or something, dunno, never used it.

As far as mp3s, here's some reference stuff:
http://computer.howstuffworks.com/mp3.htm

or specificially:
http://computer.howstuffworks.com/mp31.htm

May not be as technical as people would like, but figured this would  
confirm what I thought was done to mp3s.  From the site, it mentions  
three main characteristics of audio that relates to human hearing:
# There are certain sounds that the human ear cannot hear.
# There are certain sounds that the human ear hears much better than  
others.
# If there are two sounds playing simultaneously, we hear the louder  
one but cannot hear the softer one.

One they didn't mention, at least explicitly is bass, to some hz, is  
omnidirectional unless you go by some other means (ie the "kick" from  
a kick-drum, wearing headphones, etc)  That's why media centers just  
have one sub you put somewhere, because all the satelights can suck  
at bass reproduction but the sub will create it and you're brain will  
"attach" it to the right speaker depending, like I said the "kick" of  
a kick-drum.  Plus mp3s use some standard file compression, which  
helps alot by itself.  Don't believe me rip an audio file off a cd  
in .cda / .wav form and just use something like winzip to compress  
it, filesize will decrease a fair amount by just doing that.

I like the people that encode stuff at 320k mp3s because they think  
it will be exactly like an audio cd, even though it's still doing all  
those optimizations mentioned above.  Highest bitrate I could tell a  
difference when comparing two is 192kbps.  I still end up ripping at  
160k to save on the space and the very minor quality difference.

I don't see why they would. Art is still going to be made, regardless
the medium. Making it easy doesn't change crap into a work of art.

Is that worse? I've been to digital exhibitions (using projectors,
monitors, etc), and they can be just as interesting as any museum. I
can't think of the name of the place in Pitts. that had a big moder art
exhibit going on a while back. It had things like 12 monitors around a
table standing for the last supper, etc.

I'm not naysaying digital art at ALL.  It is two totally different things. 
But to quote a friend "telling Picaso to throw away his brushes because the 
future is digital" just doesn't make much sense in any age.  Besides obvious 
difference in physical appearance, you could never really own an original. 
There also wouldn't be any texture.

To bring this back to digital and analog (or digital dj vs vinyl dj)... the 
role of dj and producer songwriter have pretty much become the same thing 
out of necessity.  I've stated several times that I believe those roles will 
diverge again.  I believe this partially because I think truely talented 
artists/producers will want to take their songwriting beyond the limitations 
that a dj playing to a dancefloor is bound by. Not only do I think that they 
will want to expand their own horizons, but I think it will become 
necessity.  For those seeking technology and interactive experience, who 
needs a dj?  Computers can already read a crowd and program a room and the 
vast majority can't tell the differenence between a computer and real dj. It 
seems to me that computers can also be taught to make "original" 
compositions based off of input (crowd movement, heat, light, moisture, 
etc). In music it is already science that certain notes go together and 
others don't, and it seems logical that a consortium could be built off 
various formulas, key structers, etc.  This stuff really already exists in 
"music production software" and there are logical next steps that can be 
taken.  I suspect that the technology seekers will have a dream fulfilled 
when computers are programmed to provide a completley different interactive 
musical environment.  Then the of dj as we currently know it (both 
producer/artist and music mixer) becomes completely eliminated.  I would 
like to think at that point the role of dj as track selector and tastemaker 
becomes relevant again, but by my own logic maybe not?  Ah, the future!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fwd: [mw] wtf?

I guess I'll come back into this whole thing, basically on the whole 
"analog vs digital" art thing.  I feel that photoshop and computers 
ruined the art of photography much like the computer-based 
synth-synths have done for electronic music.  (like reason, where you 
can fake almost any synthesizer)  I have SO much more respect for the 
photographers who did their craft in the darkroom, creating images as 
complicated as the odd, surreal composites that the losers 
accidentally create in photoshop.  I may be a purist, but I have less 
respect for my own digital photography than I do for my "analog" 
stuff, because it was MUCH harder to do "analog".  As a result, I 
restrict my photoshop use to things I would be able to do in a darkroom.

Likewise, I would hope that a symphony orchestra would be appalled if 
synth technology advances to the point where you can "fake" an entire 
orchestra (if it's not already possible).  Sure, it may take some 
good a few hours to figure out how to program the software, but the 
art of it is gone.  the art of something is in the creation of 
it.  Jackson Pollock's artwork could probably be created in 
photoshop, but it would have none of the meaning or emotion as the 
real artwork does.  the ACT of creating the art is the art.  faking 
it in a computer just cheapens the craft.  IMHO.

Developers can continue to add logical randomization algorithms to
software as much as they want.  However, I feel no matter how far they
progress this technology it will always take a creative and
technically knowledgable biological mind to envision the final product
and put it all together in order to create something truly original.=20
Some of the greatest works in the world of electronic music have been
produced by abusing technology...by using instruments and effects in
ways other than they were intended for.  I cant imagine any algorithm
emulating human curiosity.

The orchestral thing is being done, with samples though, not synths.. 
Check out some of those gigasampler libraries.  In fact, I read an 
article where an orchestra or venue or maybe union had to explicitly ban 
this type of stuff being used to replace them.  It could have been 
something to do with an off broadway show.  If I can find it, I'll post 
it.

As far as synths goes, there are some nice digital synths that go far 
beyond what you could put in a box. I love analog, but from a broader 
perspective, if your music is shit, it doesn't matter what you use.  
There are guys with those huge analog synth collections and amazing 
studios with such in them, who make terrible almost unlistenable music 
with all of it.  Analog or digital, if you can't write a some good 
rhythms, a good melody, expressive, interesting stuff, etc, what's it to 
me what you used to hack it out?

Likewise, if you can't compose a good photograph, it doesn't matter if 
you use digital or film, it's not going to interest anyone either way.

All of these technologies - digital cameras and editing software, 
computer based music production suites and synths, sample libraries of 
orchestras - they certainly make it easy for dabblers to pick it up.  
Same with computer based djing programs, they all allow for a greater 
degree of "hackery" ..

But in the end there is still a craft and "art" to master, and just 
because some of the tools make it easier for people to become hacks, it 
doesn't mean they're holding back anyone else back from being truly 
great.. In my humble opinion.

So I have to just say here, art is art, artists are artists, and hacks 
are hacks.  You can argue forever on what is art, who is an artist and 
who is a hack...  But you all know em when you see em, and that's good 
enough, right?

I find it funny "America's #1 Hardcore DJ/producer "
has turned out to be a cd/mp3/wedding dj.  
Turning his back on his own culture once again.
You waste space on my in box.
Your burning up disk space on the ny-raves list as well.
Some real good stuff going on there you idiot.
 
Did you make this quote up or what?  What does this mean?
"America's #1 Hardcore DJ/producer "?
Are you living in a fantasy land?
You need a new angle.
Really.

 
 
"America's #1 Hardcore DJ/producer" says with his big mouth...

 I find it funny "America's #1 Hardcore DJ/producer"
 has turned out to be a cd/mp3/wedding dj. 
 Turning his back on his own culture once again.
 You waste space on my in box.
 Your burning up disk space on the ny-raves list as well.
 Some real good stuff going on there you idiot.
 
 Did you make this quote up or what? What does this mean?
 "America's #1 Hardcore DJ/producer"?
 Are you living in a fantasy land?
 You need a new angle.
 Really.



"America's #1 Hardcore DJ/producer" says with his big mouth...
 Man you people suck.
Grow the fuck up.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Oct 08                 MIX 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Cleveland

MIX. ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY w/ HABERSHAM | Abbasso | Cleveland | 
Saturday 10.08.05

HABERSHAM (Blueprint, Global Underground, Audio Therapy)
http://www.blueprintsounds.com

The two minds behind Blueprint Recordings are those of Damon 
Fonooni and Brett Abramson, known in the music industry as 
Habersham and Numinous. Although both come from two very different 
backgrounds, Habersham's roots originating in the UK, and Numinous 
coming out of the early Florida house and progressive scene, they 
both share varied musical influences. These include jazz, classic 
soul and funk, such as Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Prince, an "Off 
The Wall" Michael Jackson and George Clinton/P-Funk, to Radiohead, 
Nine Inch Nails and early Renaissance house.

Each has been DJing for more than six years and producing original 
music for nearly as long. Together they play varied sounds from 
funky and groovey to deep and headfuck, from techy and tribal to 
melodic and breaky, all of which revolves around their roots in 
house music. Habersham and Numinous' Blueprint club night in 
Atlanta has gained recognition across the globe as being one of 
the only consistent and next-level dance music experiences in the 
Southeastern US, bringing in such groundbreaking artists as Phil 
K, Ashley Casselle, Chris Micali and Ali Ajami.

The music of Blueprint Recordings has already received support 
from Sasha, Sander Kleinenberg, Chris Fortier, Jimmy Van M, Phil 
K, Timo Maas, Martin Villeneuve (MV/Envy), Christopher Lawrence, 
Dave Ralph, Barry Gilbey, Kasey Taylor, Jonathan Ojeda, the 
Scumfrog, Dave Dresden and many, many more. It's house music with 
a subtle funkiness and a deep and dirty edge. The sound of 
Blueprint borrows from classic progressive elements and fuses them 
with quirky sounds of the future, while never losing its ability 
to stimulate the mind and the feet.

No matter the differentiating styles of music you may hear from 
Blueprint, there will always be one constant: pushing minds 
forward and breaking down genre barriers. Conformity:beware.

/ / / / / / / / MUSICAN INFO

TOK TOK 'LIVE PA' [ BERLIN / GERMANY . TOK TOK REC. ]
Founded in 1994 in Europe's techno capital, TokTok creates original
soundscapes, expanding modern style boundaries.  TokTok is renowned
for their 'live performances', which entailed bringing the studio,
synthesizers, drumcomputers, effects, and an enormous mixing console,
to the party.  Innumerable performances and 23 record releases later,
their evolved sound is dedicated to making you dance.

MICHA KLANG [ NRNBERG / GERMANY . PASO MUSIC . MOTHERSHIP ]
Micha Klang's style is marked by a love for long sets of minimal,
textured tech-house and crunchy, crispy techno beats.  Originating in
Nrnberg in the late '90s, Micha Klang quickly broke ground with his
'Mothership' event.  'Summership', an open air event in an old castle
was attended by thousands. 'Mothership' recently celebrated its 6th
Anniversary, headlining Sven Vath, and today Micha Klang runs his
label 'Paso Music' with Spallek, Sebrok, and Marc Miroir.

JUSTIN SCHUMACHER [ NYC . SATELLITE RECORDS ]
This young emerging dj/producer from the land of crooks is steadily
gaining local praise for his ass-shaking, thought provoking sets. His
style ranges from deep and mental, to dancefloor phunk, to straight
dark bangin madness. There is no monotony, just an evolving journey
through this elaborate music we call techno.

MIKO [ PHILADELPHIA . f(x) ]
In 1993 Miko brought his blend of funky house and disco to The Freight
Yard and established himself as a resident deejay there.  This club
was located in a warehouse in Allentown, PA and is known for the
legendary all night events and weeklies that took place when the rave
scene was starting up in the US. At a time when techno music was the
standard, Miko defied the norm by giving the crowd an awesome house
set while at the same time keeping interest through a unique energy of
driving techno sounds.

VEX [ PHILADELPHIA . f(x) ]
With a mysterious past, ranging from former KGB agent to founding
father of the Illuminati, not much is known about Vex. He shows up,
does as asked, and makes a prompt exit while leaving no traces, aside
from the occasional person seeking the name of a track he played.
People who know his true identity describe him as "A tall, short,
white black fat skinny man with blue black green short long hair, and
brown blue eyes. Oh, and he's really into Toblerone"

Doormouse - Miami, FL
Addict, Distort, Planet-Mu, Epileptik, Violent Turd, Schematic, 
Sublight,
CockRockDisco, Zod

Doormouse has been producing some of the most slammingest sick-ass jams 
since 1852. He used a potato and 4 live chickens. Although all masters 
were destroyed by fire, these recordings live on in the hearts and minds 
of the very dead chickens. Now he is the OG Midwest badass and depending 
on which side of the fence you're standing on, Daniel "doormouse" 
Martinstein is either a complete waste of time or a complete waste of 
space. Imagine camping with Dennis Hopper and he roofies you out in the 
woods somewhere and you wake up sewn to a family of badgers. Well he's 
sicker. Take one part Gloria Estefan, one part DJ Paul, one part Guy 
Lombardo and there you have it. Don't worry, we're not sure either. What 
you witness may not be safe.

Wed Oct 26                     UNSILENT FILM 5                    Cleveland

SynthCleveland will present the 1921 classic silent horror film "The 
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" featuring a new live improvised soundtrack on 
Wednesday, October 26 at 8pm, at Rain Nightclub, 4142 Lorain Avenue in 
Cleveland.

Directed by Robert Wiene, "Caligari" is considered to be one of the 
landmark examples of the German Expressionist style (i.e. "Nosferatu", 
"Faust", "Metropolis"). The film is enigmatic and highly stylized, with 
a twist ending that M. Night Shyamalan wishes he had used -- madness, 
love, murder and sonambulists -- all set against a carnival side-show 
backdrop.

This is the fifth in a series of "UnSilent" films -- old movies with an 
added improvised live score -- performed this time by SynthCleveland 
members Steven K. Smith, Thieves Like Me, tofu, dust_head and 
fluxmonkey.

Spinning before and after the film will be special guest DJ Feima from 
WCSB's "F2" show.

SynthCleveland is a resource group for area electronic musicians holding 
meetings and presenting workshops related to electronic music.

Rain Nightclub is located at 4142 Lorain Avenue (216-651-4100). For 
directions go to: http://tinyurl.com/5cfyr

Admission (21+) is Free.

DESTINY666: RETURN TO THE gRAVE!
The Docks Nightclub .. Toronto, ON, Canada
Four Rooms .. One Evil Vibe!
On Oct 29th, 2005 it is time once again to enter the evil lair. To 
travel through the dark city and across the river Styx to a place on the 
very shores of hell. It is a place where demons of the wheel will force 
your feet to move in an ever more frenzied fashion, faster and faster 
until the energy of your very soul is laid waste on the dance floor. It 
is a place where as the clock strikes 12 and the witching hour is upon 
us, we shall drag the best costumes from the flaming pit and parade 
their last vestiges of tattered humanity for all to see. We shall judge 
who shall ascend to world of bliss and who shall be cast down into 
damnation. If thee is deemed to be worthy and be dressed as the
best in your category, ye shall trade your soul for CASH and VIP (Vile 
Inbred Paragon) access to ALL Destiny & TR events (including WEMF) for 
one turn of the calendar year. As the night grows later and the blood 
red moon is upon us once more, our witches and warlocks will cast their 
evil magic about the room and turn all clocks back one hour. Where once 
it will have been two, it shall revert back to one. The decadence and 
debauchery will continue late into the early morning?
ON HALLOWEEN .. THIS IS THE BIG ONE! Missing out would be a GRAVE 
mistake!

SUBURBAN KNIGHT AKA JAMES PENNINGTON . DARK ENERGY [ DETROIT .
UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE . DARK PRINT . SOG RESEARCH ]
This man's contributions to the world of techno and house are
unequivocal. Pennington started out as a college party DJ alongside
Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May, and Eddie Fowlkes.Then he,
made his way into the world of techno, forever changing it with his
hit " The Art of Stalking" on the fledgling Transmat label.

As a member of Saunderson's group Inner City when they recorded their
biggest hits, "Big Fun" and "Good Life," he later went on to join the
Underground Resistance (UR) camp and as a producer and touring DJ. His
first vinyl offering for UR was the massive techno hit "Nocturbulus
Behavior."

 He has since started his own label, Dark Print, in which the first
release "Tech-hieroglyphics," was a compilation album of Detroit and
Belgian artists. Pennington chooses to release new music less
frequently than many of his peers, describing his releases as
"essential lessons." His performances as a DJ are no different: rare,
much sought after, and not forgotten.

DAN PHYSICS [ BROOKLYN . SONIC GROOVE . CREME ORGANIZATION . CONRAIL ]
Just back from touring in Brazil for a few months, funkshun welcomes
Dan Physics to philadelphia for the third time. A veteran DJ and
Producer from NYC, Dan mixes a blend of Techno, Industrial, Acid
House, and EBM, with a focus on keeping the mood deep, grooving, and
dark.


CRAIG SOPO [ BALTIMORE VIA DETROIT ]
Recently relocating from Detroit to Baltimore, Craig Sopo brings over
6 years of experience behind the decks. Originally intrigued by the
percussive sounds of the Code Red and Drum Code labels, in the last
few years his sets have become more and more acidic, drawing from
labels as diverse as Krax, Communique and Definitive. Having been a
regular on the popular Michigan State University radio show The
Mechanical Pulse, his sets are not one to miss. Come out to hear this
native Detroiter's first show on the East Coast.

TOM++ [ PHILADELPHIA . FUNKSHUN]
Stripped-down funk and rhythm, always unpredictable. Choosing from a
wide arragement of sounds, Tom++ brings a clever warmth and emotion to
the moment, while revealing an insightful view of the reality we
inhabit. It is his continued dedication to advancement of all aspects
of the music, community, and culture that keeps Tom++ near the heart
of the Philadelphia and Global electronic music movement.

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

Nice, Wish is the only club in the warehouse district worth going to 
imo.  Nice to see it pushing forward.

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/2005-10-01-acidhouse

man, what a fucking sound system.  cleanest sound i've heard in awhile,
and could move some fucking air.

punisher killed it

dave the drummer wasn't all i'd expected

phantom 45 pulled out some old jump up

danny the wildchild - jungle on the wall of bass.  omg!!!1one

not sure of the guy closing down the small bar room, but he was all over
the place, b-52s, kraftwerk, some disco stuff, new wave.  actually the
most interesting set of the night.

holtz: "for a party called acid house i'd expect more acid house"

this place was in tha ghetto.  one of the other ohio kids had their car
busted into.  ick.

ramp to I-96 was closed, minor detour totally winging it we found the
place, paul and forte got hella lost

forte was mad krunked

all in all exactly what you'd expect from a detroit party

THURSDAYS@HAVANA
TONIGHT  10.06.05

[BROTHER MIKE] - 10pm & 1am - Deep Soulful House Music.

[MARC HUG] of the [INTERGALACTIC FAERIE FUNK]- 11pm to 1am - intergalactic 
faerie funk is an ever evolving project started by marc hug which began as a 
one man 'live pa' using two groove boxes and two emu samplers.  it soon 
evolved into two people, eventually mushrooming into a 4 piece band of 
rotating characters.  a rock band armed with samplers, sequencers, drum 
machines, bass guitar and a punk rock d.i.y. ethic ready to shake up 
electronic dance music culture.

just recently, with the release of the ottawa 12" single on robbaudio and 
the upcoming release of a
four song vinyl ep, things have come full circle. intergalactic faerie funk 
has returned to it's signature style of electronic house music based on 
strange tones & textures; as well as finding a return to the 'live pa' 
started by marc hug - although this time he is armed with a laptop, effects 
box, controller, & ableton live.  www.galactique.net

Subject: {pb-cle} Stir-Fridays/Abbasso This Friday (bsp)

Stir-Fridays is a free weekly at abbasso that
showcases some of the best DJ's from the Clevland
area.  This Friday I'm playing, so that 'best' part
may be in question, but regardless it should be a fun
evening of all sorts of tech-related music.

Jamie Tyler (me) will be playing some acid-house and
perhaps a little techno
Candice Radin will most likely play minimal tech-type
stuff
Residents Darbe and Cloud Ten play all kinds of tech
house/breaks/other stuff.

10pm-2:30am
free
21+

If you've got nothing better to do come out and get
sloppy with us (or laugh at us getting sloppy).

-Jamie

Subject: {pb-cle} 10/17 : Grooverider @ Opium : Buffalo, NY

GROOVERIDER 
DRUM + BASS // Radio 1 // Prototype // Metalheadz 
UK 
As one of the figures synonymous with the origins of
drum & bass, Grooverider has become a cipher for the
sound of a generation. In the close-knit social
circles of drum & bass, the mention of his name, which
reads like a definition n of the art of dj-ing,
inspires nothing but the utmost respect and admiration
due to the fact that he has held a torch aloft for
this music for so many years.

Subject: {pb-cle} 10/21 : AK1200 @ Opium : Buffalo, NY

AK1200
[Planet of the Drums / Orlando Florida] www.ak1200.com
- Americas original jungle/drum n bass don has been
pushing the sound since the musics initial
incarnation as hardcore breakbeat. As one of the
U.S.s original proponents of breakbeat music, AK
started DJing in 1989, playing electro and other beat
friendly music of that time. In 1990, he opened a
record store in his hometown of Orlando, FL called The
Hottie Shoppe, where he began developing relationships
with burgeoning breakbeat labels such as Suburban Base
and Moving Shadow. Via these early relationships, he
quickly became known in the UK as someone who could
spread the message in America, and by 1991, he was
writing articles and reviews in the classic US Rave.
Around this same time, Dave Minner also gained his
moniker as AK1200 when fellow Floridian DJ Icey
noticed the hyped-up BPMs of the tunes Dave would
play in The Hottie Shop, and said Youre playing so
fast that you are like an AK on the 1200s! Icey
started throwing raves at The Edge and he would put
Dave AK1200 Minner on the flyer. The name stuck ever
since.

TWISTED INDIVIDUAL WITH MC QUESTIONMARK 
FRIDAY OCT 28TH 
PRIZES 
DRINKSPECIALS 
GIVEAWAYS 

BASSBIN TWINS 
Bassbin Twins have been releasing records in the
underground dance music scene since 1992 including
their own Bassbin Twins Volume series, ep's for labels
like Skint and Southern Fried, SSR, Marine Parade,
Mute, Spider Cuts, and numerous remixes for artists
including Boogie Down Productions, Evil 9, DJ Punk
Roc, Dub Pistols, Freakpower, etc. 

The Bassbin Twins live set is an anything goes mix

jacking tech house, electro, and funky drum and bass
all put through the Bassbin blender and mashed in the
name of up for it party music. The Bassbin Twins live

guaranteed highlights of any event 


TWISTED INDIVIDUAL 
DRUM + BASS // Formation // Grid Recordings  UK 

Twisted Individual (aka Lee Greenaway) is a talented
producer hailing originally from Croydon, South
London. Lee got into dance music at a very early age
and like many used to buy tape packs from his local
record shop to hear the freshest tunes. He liked what
was happening to Jungle/Drum & Bass so saved up his
money and brought himself a pair of T1210's and a
mixer and began to teach himself to mix. Once he was
confident enough he started to play at a few parties
and on local radio stations such as Shadow FM and
Flight FM; he still plays as a regular guest on London
based station Ruud Awakening. 

MC QUESTION MARK 
INTELLECTUAL & RHYTHMIC // MICTLAN // SCIENCE // LOS
ANGELES

One of the most recognized and beloved voices of the
North American drum 'n' bass scene, MC Question Mark
is one of the original driving force of the
still-growing sound on these shores. 

Born and raised in the Peckham suburb of southeast
London, England, Question Mark, nee Devon Andrew
Morgan, moved to Los Angeles, California in 1987.
Pushed to the United States on the insistence of his
parents, it was a way to get Question Mark out of the
distracting elements of his surroundings and
encouraging him to attend college Stateside. Once
settled in Los Angeles, Question Mark completed a
degree in business administration at Los Angeles Trade
Tech College and California State University Los
Angeles.

Nitty Gritty returns to Touch! 
Saturday, October 8th / 9pm

Featuring Steve Raskin (Fort Knox 5 / Thunderball / Washington DC) 

OK, this is one for everyone - especially all the breaks / dnb kids. I won't
spam you all with a massive bio or anything (you can read an interview here)
<http://www.varietyisthespice.com/press-by-christine/fortknoxfive.html>  
but this guy will run the gamut from dub to dnb to house and breaks... 

For those who don't know, Fort Knox is an off shoot of Thunderball (on
Thievery Corp's ESL Label) and has been blowing up like a motha! They've
worked with and remixed Afrika Bambaataa, Dynamo Productions, Nickodemus, Ed
Royal, All Good Funk Alliance, Ursula 1000, Thievery Corp, Jalepeno
Recordings etc etc. 

We do hope you can make it on the 8th for Nitty Gritty's return to Touch and
for one hell of a good time!

 

$5 / FREE before 11pm
**FREE with admission to Le Futur at the Asterisk Gallery**

 

Touch is located at:

2710 Lorain Ave

Cleveland, OH

Subject: {pb-cle} upcoming Pittsburgh synthpop show

According to the Cohaagen website (http://www.cohaagen.com/news.html), 
Pittsburgh bands Fr/action and "Surviving the Odyssey" are playing at Moxie 
Dada next friday.

Oddly, the Moxie Dada website doesn't mention them.

Since it's an exhibit opening, I suspect there's no cover.

It was good to see our fellow plate tectitions keeping
the techno vibe going accross town. We switched
dates with them for next month. The next psy-tektonics
is Saturday 10-15.

Subject: {pb-cle} Psy-Tektonics - Ohio Possum Psy this Saturday!

If you haven't heard Moke before, he is
an excellent DJ! He should have an extra
big helping of Ohio possum psy.....
that's a wayne county thing. It's
his birthday, so he will be ready
to throw down! If you are still not
sure, then maybe you can just envision
Lieutenant 'Lefty' Enright (Dennis Hopper)
from the "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"
on the one's and two's. It will be kinda
like that....

This may be our last event of the year.
I'm not sure if we will be doing anything
in November/December.

Peace and Skillet Grease!

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Few people can claim to have been at the pinnacle of their profession 
for a sustained period of time, having enjoyed so much success and still 
be leading the way forward. John 00 Fleming, one of the dance music 
industries most revered personalities, is amongst a small band of people 
who can say they were responsible for igniting the spark of the scene we 
all know and love today.

A DJ career spanning more than 18 years from the ripe old age of 15 has 
afforded John 00 the sort of experience that most other DJs can only 
dream of. Never afraid to push the boundaries in the projects that he 
turns his hand to, he is the owner of the hugely successful J00F 
recordings and hosts his own radio show on Ministry of Sound, the highly 
popular .Global Trance Grooves..

A musical taste that transcends genres and his determination to seek out 
fresh, new, exciting music has resulted in John playing in almost every 
corner of the world and it is with great anticipation that he returns to 
DC, as he is truly one of the worlds greatest DJs.

Fri Oct 14                       LITTLE MIKE                     Pittsburgh

Little Mike (Casa Del Soul, Sondos, Hallucination Ltd., Funk'd, 
Phrunky.com) Denver

Have you ever met someone and within moments you realized that the 
person that you are talking to just isn't wired correctly? The person 
has such a perverse and warped impression of the world that you are 
drawn to him as one would become enthralled with the gruesome 
fascination of a car wreck. Well, Little Mike is such a person. His 
instrument of depravity: house music - dirty, filthy, naughty beats, 
that get stuck in your head and seductively whisper in your ear; telling 
you to do things that would make a stripper blush.

Hailing from the Mile High City, Little Mike is no stranger to purveyors 
of dark and twisted house music. He has been fertilizing beats with the 
tenacity of a 16 year boy that has just hit puberty. If you haven't 
played one of his productions, then chances are the only audiences that 
you've rocked out to recently are the stuff animals residing on your 
bedroom's shelves. Take notice folks: John Digweed just asked him to 
make a mix for his Kiss 100 radio show. In short this means that this 
foul-mouthed, mohawk-sport'en, chick-magnet, with a disposition inclined 
to debauchery can melt some panties. I do not need to tell you to come 
the show, I merely need to advise you to bring a change of underwear. 
Your old pair is going to be left tattered, stained, and battered.

Also featuring the

White Trash Mullets (SoulGlo Records)

Steve Simpson would like to invite you to yet another evening of 
up-front, forward-thinking house music. The experience may just lower 
your overall purity score

/ / / / / / / / MUSICAN INFO

TOK TOK 'LIVE PA' [ BERLIN / GERMANY . TOK TOK REC. ]
Founded in 1994 in Europe's techno capital, TokTok creates original
soundscapes, expanding modern style boundaries.  TokTok is renowned
for their 'live performances', which entailed bringing the studio,
synthesizers, drumcomputers, effects, and an enormous mixing console,
to the party.  Innumerable performances and 23 record releases later,
their evolved sound is dedicated to making you dance.

MICHA KLANG [ NRNBERG / GERMANY . PASO MUSIC . MOTHERSHIP ]
Micha Klang's style is marked by a love for long sets of minimal,
textured tech-house and crunchy, crispy techno beats.  Originating in
Nrnberg in the late '90s, Micha Klang quickly broke ground with his
'Mothership' event.  'Summership', an open air event in an old castle
was attended by thousands. 'Mothership' recently celebrated its 6th
Anniversary, headlining Sven Vath, and today Micha Klang runs his
label 'Paso Music' with Spallek, Sebrok, and Marc Miroir.

JUSTIN SCHUMACHER [ NYC . SATELLITE RECORDS ]
This young emerging dj/producer from the land of crooks is steadily
gaining local praise for his ass-shaking, thought provoking sets. His
style ranges from deep and mental, to dancefloor phunk, to straight
dark bangin madness. There is no monotony, just an evolving journey
through this elaborate music we call techno.

MIKO [ PHILADELPHIA . f(x) ]
In 1993 Miko brought his blend of funky house and disco to The Freight
Yard and established himself as a resident deejay there.  This club
was located in a warehouse in Allentown, PA and is known for the
legendary all night events and weeklies that took place when the rave
scene was starting up in the US. At a time when techno music was the
standard, Miko defied the norm by giving the crowd an awesome house
set while at the same time keeping interest through a unique energy of
driving techno sounds.

VEX [ PHILADELPHIA . f(x) ]
With a mysterious past, ranging from former KGB agent to founding
father of the Illuminati, not much is known about Vex. He shows up,
does as asked, and makes a prompt exit while leaving no traces, aside
from the occasional person seeking the name of a track he played.
People who know his true identity describe him as "A tall, short,
white black fat skinny man with blue black green short long hair, and
brown blue eyes. Oh, and he's really into Toblerone"

As one of the figures synonymous with the origins of

Fri Oct 21                         AK1200                           Buffalo

AK1200
[Planet of the Drums / Orlando Florida] www.ak1200.com
- America.s original jungle/drum n bass don has been
pushing the sound since the music.s initial
incarnation as hardcore breakbeat. As one of the
U.S..s original proponents of breakbeat music, AK
started DJing in 1989, playing electro and other beat
friendly music of that time. In 1990, he opened a
record store in his hometown of Orlando, FL called The
Hottie Shoppe, where he began developing relationships
with burgeoning breakbeat labels such as Suburban Base
and Moving Shadow. Via these early relationships, he
quickly became known in the UK as someone who could
spread the message in America, and by 1991, he was
writing articles and reviews in the classic US Rave.
Around this same time, Dave Minner also gained his
moniker as AK1200 when fellow Floridian DJ Icey
noticed the hyped-up BPM.s of the tunes Dave would
play in The Hottie Shop, and said .You.re playing so
fast that you are like an AK on the 1200.s!. Icey
started throwing raves at The Edge and he would put
.Dave AK1200 Minner. on the flyer. The name stuck ever
since.

Doormouse - Miami, FL
Addict, Distort, Planet-Mu, Epileptik, Violent Turd, Schematic, 
Sublight,
CockRockDisco, Zod

Doormouse has been producing some of the most slammingest sick-ass jams 
since 1852. He used a potato and 4 live chickens. Although all masters 
were destroyed by fire, these recordings live on in the hearts and minds 
of the very dead chickens. Now he is the OG Midwest badass and depending 
on which side of the fence you're standing on, Daniel "doormouse" 
Martinstein is either a complete waste of time or a complete waste of 
space. Imagine camping with Dennis Hopper and he roofies you out in the 
woods somewhere and you wake up sewn to a family of badgers. Well he's 
sicker. Take one part Gloria Estefan, one part DJ Paul, one part Guy 
Lombardo and there you have it. Don't worry, we're not sure either. What 
you witness may not be safe.

Wed Oct 26                     UNSILENT FILM 5                    Cleveland

SynthCleveland will present the 1921 classic silent horror film "The 
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" featuring a new live improvised soundtrack on 
Wednesday, October 26 at 8pm, at Rain Nightclub, 4142 Lorain Avenue in 
Cleveland.

Directed by Robert Wiene, "Caligari" is considered to be one of the 
landmark examples of the German Expressionist style (i.e. "Nosferatu", 
"Faust", "Metropolis"). The film is enigmatic and highly stylized, with 
a twist ending that M. Night Shyamalan wishes he had used -- madness, 
love, murder and sonambulists -- all set against a carnival side-show 
backdrop.

This is the fifth in a series of "UnSilent" films -- old movies with an 
added improvised live score -- performed this time by SynthCleveland 
members Steven K. Smith, Thieves Like Me, tofu, dust_head and 
fluxmonkey.

Spinning before and after the film will be special guest DJ Feima from 
WCSB's "F2" show.

SynthCleveland is a resource group for area electronic musicians holding 
meetings and presenting workshops related to electronic music.

Rain Nightclub is located at 4142 Lorain Avenue (216-651-4100). For 
directions go to: http://tinyurl.com/5cfyr

Admission (21+) is Free.

TWISTED INDIVIDUAL 
DRUM + BASS // Formation // Grid Recordings  UK 

Twisted Individual (aka Lee Greenaway) is a talented
producer hailing originally from Croydon, South
London. Lee got into dance music at a very early age
and like many used to buy tape packs from his local
record shop to hear the freshest tunes. He liked what
was happening to Jungle/Drum & Bass so saved up his
money and brought himself a pair of T1210's and a
mixer and began to teach himself to mix. Once he was
confident enough he started to play at a few parties
and on local radio stations such as Shadow FM and
Flight FM; he still plays as a regular guest on London
based station Ruud Awakening. 

MC QUESTION MARK 
INTELLECTUAL & RHYTHMIC // MICTLAN // SCIENCE // LOS
ANGELES

One of the most recognized and beloved voices of the
North American drum 'n' bass scene, MC Question Mark
is one of the original driving force of the
still-growing sound on these shores. 

Born and raised in the Peckham suburb of southeast
London, England, Question Mark, nee Devon Andrew
Morgan, moved to Los Angeles, California in 1987.
Pushed to the United States on the insistence of his
parents, it was a way to get Question Mark out of the
distracting elements of his surroundings and
encouraging him to attend college Stateside. Once
settled in Los Angeles, Question Mark completed a
degree in business administration at Los Angeles Trade
Tech College and California State University Los
Angeles.

DESTINY666: RETURN TO THE gRAVE!
The Docks Nightclub .. Toronto, ON, Canada
Four Rooms .. One Evil Vibe!
On Oct 29th, 2005 it is time once again to enter the evil lair. To 
travel through the dark city and across the river Styx to a place on the 
very shores of hell. It is a place where demons of the wheel will force 
your feet to move in an ever more frenzied fashion, faster and faster 
until the energy of your very soul is laid waste on the dance floor. It 
is a place where as the clock strikes 12 and the witching hour is upon 
us, we shall drag the best costumes from the flaming pit and parade 
their last vestiges of tattered humanity for all to see. We shall judge 
who shall ascend to world of bliss and who shall be cast down into 
damnation. If thee is deemed to be worthy and be dressed as the
best in your category, ye shall trade your soul for CASH and VIP (Vile 
Inbred Paragon) access to ALL Destiny & TR events (including WEMF) for 
one turn of the calendar year. As the night grows later and the blood 
red moon is upon us once more, our witches and warlocks will cast their 
evil magic about the room and turn all clocks back one hour. Where once 
it will have been two, it shall revert back to one. The decadence and 
debauchery will continue late into the early morning?
ON HALLOWEEN .. THIS IS THE BIG ONE! Missing out would be a GRAVE 
mistake!

SUBURBAN KNIGHT AKA JAMES PENNINGTON . DARK ENERGY [ DETROIT .
UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE . DARK PRINT . SOG RESEARCH ]
This man's contributions to the world of techno and house are
unequivocal. Pennington started out as a college party DJ alongside
Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May, and Eddie Fowlkes.Then he,
made his way into the world of techno, forever changing it with his
hit " The Art of Stalking" on the fledgling Transmat label.

As a member of Saunderson's group Inner City when they recorded their
biggest hits, "Big Fun" and "Good Life," he later went on to join the
Underground Resistance (UR) camp and as a producer and touring DJ. His
first vinyl offering for UR was the massive techno hit "Nocturbulus
Behavior."

 He has since started his own label, Dark Print, in which the first
release "Tech-hieroglyphics," was a compilation album of Detroit and
Belgian artists. Pennington chooses to release new music less
frequently than many of his peers, describing his releases as
"essential lessons." His performances as a DJ are no different: rare,
much sought after, and not forgotten.

DAN PHYSICS [ BROOKLYN . SONIC GROOVE . CREME ORGANIZATION . CONRAIL ]
Just back from touring in Brazil for a few months, funkshun welcomes
Dan Physics to philadelphia for the third time. A veteran DJ and
Producer from NYC, Dan mixes a blend of Techno, Industrial, Acid
House, and EBM, with a focus on keeping the mood deep, grooving, and
dark.


CRAIG SOPO [ BALTIMORE VIA DETROIT ]
Recently relocating from Detroit to Baltimore, Craig Sopo brings over
6 years of experience behind the decks. Originally intrigued by the
percussive sounds of the Code Red and Drum Code labels, in the last
few years his sets have become more and more acidic, drawing from
labels as diverse as Krax, Communique and Definitive. Having been a
regular on the popular Michigan State University radio show The
Mechanical Pulse, his sets are not one to miss. Come out to hear this
native Detroiter's first show on the East Coast.

TOM++ [ PHILADELPHIA . FUNKSHUN]
Stripped-down funk and rhythm, always unpredictable. Choosing from a
wide arragement of sounds, Tom++ brings a clever warmth and emotion to
the moment, while revealing an insightful view of the reality we
inhabit. It is his continued dedication to advancement of all aspects
of the music, community, and culture that keeps Tom++ near the heart
of the Philadelphia and Global electronic music movement.

TREVITT [ PHILADELPHIA . FV . AUTOMATIC ]

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

oh yeah ... I was actually in London shortly after this happened.  I

THE BACKGROUND STORY TO AN URBAN JAZZ MASTERPIECE:

It all started after Charlie (6=B9 8=B2) Tate graduated from the London School
of Furniture. Approached by the infamous Paris based Big Cheese Records to
form a funk band, and Big Cheese All Stars was born! 2 singles, an album an=
d
several extensive stints of touring and supporting the likes of Don
Blackman, Roy Ayers, Gil Scott-Heron, Fred Wesley AND James Brown put an en=
d
to a career in bespoke cabinet making. A future immersed in the funk, the
soul and the jazz seemed assured. While still with the All Stars, an
opportunity to play bass in Neneh Cherry=B9s band arose and the best part of =
a
year was spent on the road touring her =B3Woman=B3album. A lot of fun was had. =
A
lot of drinking was done. But the love of the funk, the soul and the jazz
prevailed. Unfortunately the sheer size of what the All Stars had become
essentially caused its demise, putting eleven plus personnel on the road
became a logistical liability.

Just about then with a bit of folding in the pocket, the idea of forming a
record company began to take shape. Your people, King Kooba, had been in
existence for some time now, the first releases having been released on a
subsidiary of the aforementioned Big Cheese Records. But the thought of an
autonomous vessel for representing the Kooba and several other projects
seemed too good to resist. Enter Second Skin Records, and what a productive
lot they turned out to be! Roughly 30 singles and 12 albums, not a bad
output from a hybrid label offering all manner of styles from drum and bass=
,
beats, ambient bizniss, electronica and breaks. Pretty much most of what wa=
s
going on at the time, perhaps the varied style of the label, but
particularly what the Kooba were up to, appealed to San Francisco=B9s Om
Records. Several licenses, then an album and a relationship with Om had bee=
n
cemented. With the release of =B3Indian Summer=B2 in the fall of 02=B9, a man lik=
e
Charlie decided his fate lay in the Bay area=8A..

The rest as they say is history! A hook up with Om=B9s press officer Gunnar
Hissam and a shared obsession of all things that contain the funk, the soul=
,
and the jazz started a weekly serving of all the above at a local hostelry
deemed Slow Gin. Combined with plenty of refreshing beverages, and all the
deepest jazz and soul they could get their hands on, many of Oakland=B9s
finest came to hang out and check the sounds. Even the OPD were known to
roll up in a squad car just to listen to the vibes=8A.for real! Then just
about last call, oh shit, open mic! Much of what Colossus is about,
originated right there! Contacts, MC=B9s, Musicians, all gathered and vibing
to the sounds. Colossus =AD Tate=B9s Oakland based hip hop collective was born!
Bay Area MC=B9s: Capitol A, Azeem, Regi B & Delphi along with London=B9s own
Hilton Smythe (AKA Roots Manuva) all joined in on the fun. The results:
=B3West Oakland=B2 =AD an urban jazz masterpiece hits the streets on October 11th=

Jeff Samuel
(Poker Flat / Spectral / Kompakt / Seattle)

touring schedule while continuing his steady output as a producer and
remixer. Plans for the future include a Mix CD and debut LP.

For fans of live electronic shows, broken beats, neo-soul etc - this is a
show NOT TO BE MISSED!  

 

Saturday, October 22 / 10pm

John Arnold / Jeremy Ellis (Ayro)

(Ubiquity Recordings / Detroit)

 

$5 / FREE before 11pm

 

Read on:

 

John Arnold and Jeremy Ellis have a lot in common, so it's not surprising
that they're touring together. More unusual is the fact that the two solo
artists are playing together in one set, mixing between their songs and
creating new ones on the fly in a seamless flow of music much like a DJ set.

 

"What we're doing is basically like two DJs playing back to back," explains
Arnold from his Detroit home. "We build the songs up from scratch, playing
the beats on the MPC (sampler) and improvising on top of it."

 

Both of the Detroit-based artists were serious musicians before they caught
the techno bug. They're also both signed to Ubiquity Records and specialize
in a rhythmically complex electronic jazz funk similar to the sound that
developed simultaneously overseas in the West London broken beat and nu-jazz
scene. They've worked together in the past on various projects but are
taking it to another level with this live pairing.

 

"It was a really natural process. We used to be roommates, and we both
started producing at the same time. I think Jeremy even used my gear on his
first productions till he got his own."

 

Arnold has just completed a new album for fall release that finds him
integrating the new freedom he's found playing live into his sound, and it
features a guest appearances by Ellis alongside other vocalists. Compared to
last year's Neighborhood Science, Style And Pattern sounds more upbeat and
more raw, with a wider palette of influences.

 

"Every song on the new album started out live. I was travelling around and
playing all over, developing the songs in front of audiences. It helped me
get perspective on what moves a dance floor.

 

"It also has a lot more guitar than the last. I use a MIDI guitar to play
the keyboard parts and the bass lines. I started doing it around two years
ago, when I was on tour with Amp Fiddler. Before, I'd always felt like I was
holding back, because I'm not really a keyboard player. Now I can trigger
any sound I want."

 

Using MIDI guitar interfaces to trigger synths and samplers isn't a new
technology, but it hasn't been too prevalent in underground music. Yet when
you take into account the fact that the mythical TB303 bass synth was
originally developed to accompany one-man-band bar performers before its
eerie squeal and robotic sequencer were appropriated for use in techno and
acid house, maybe it's not that odd that Arnold has managed to infuse it
with a bit of cool.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

October's installment of TechMix brings us 

Dwreck (Wallpaper Visuals, CMHA) 

He's swapping his projectors for turntables (and a laptop) for an evening to provide us with a two hour set of minimal tastiness to start off the night proper. 

Jamie Tyler (Plate Tectonics) 

will follow with his normal assortment of nastiness...and it's been a minute since he's  played a later set so expect some stomping tunes from him.  (in otherwords..some good techno!)
10 pm - 2:30 (ish) am 

Free! 

21+ please 

TechMix takes place at the Abbasso Underground Lounge located at: 
1222 prospect (prospect entrance will be closed...enter from the Bolivar side) 

216-566-7278

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Spooky in Cleveland on Sunday {{Free}}

Sunday October 23rd, 2:00pm @ the Cleveland Public Library (East 6th 
and Superior Ave.)

Cleveland Public Library in collaboration with Cleveland Public Art 
announces  the second presentation of Spectrum: the Lockwood Thompson 
Dialogues, a new two-part annual program. This innovative program 
will engage the diverse Cleveland community in a series of public 
conversations focusing on issues that impact visual and  popular 
culture and is supported by Cleveland Public Library's Lockwood 
Thompson  Fund.

Free and open to the public, the event will be held in the Main 
Library, Louis  Stokes Wing Auditorium, E. 6th Street and Superior, 
Sunday, October 23, 2:00 p.m.

The 2005 series topic is Truth, Technology and the Visual/Virtual 
World.  The  October 23 rd event will bring Paul D. Miller together 
with moderator Jaron Lanier on  topics as diverse as cultural 
identity and visual and audio art in relation to technology.   Miller 
is a conceptual artist, writer, and musician working in New York 
City.  His media  work has appeared as part of the Whitney Biennial, 
the 2000 Venice Biennale for  Architecture, and the Lincoln Center 
Festival.  He is also known as "DJ Spooky That  Subliminal Kid," a 
"constructed persona" who records and performs his own work 
globally, as well as collaborating with such figures as Ryuichi 
Sakamoto and Yoko Ono.   His writings can be found on Slate.com, in 
Paper and Index magazines, as well as the  Village Voice and 
Artforum.  His first collection of essays, Rhythm Science (MIT 
Press),  will be available for purchase and signing at the event.

Jaron Lanier, computer scientist, visual artist, and author returns 
to the Cleveland  Public Library to moderate the second Spectrum 
dialogue. Best known for coining the term "Virtual Reality," he is a 
renowned speaker and author on topics including the  social impact of 
technology, the philosophy of consciousness and information, and the 
future of humanism. Lanier is currently a visiting faculty member of 
at the Thayer School  of Engineering at Dartmouth, the Wharton School 
of Business of the University of  Pennsylvania, the Interactive 
Telecommunications Program of the Tisch School of the  Arts at New 
York University.  His writing appears in The New York Times, 
Discover, The  Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Harpers Magazine, The 
Sciences, Wired Magazine (where  he is a founding contributing 
editor), and Scientific American.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Here's a short bio:

Seattle-based Jeff Samuel.s debut single was released by Germany.s Lo-Fi 
Stereo Recordings in 1999. Over 10 EP.s later, he has become one of 
America.s most respected minimal producers, recording for labels such as 
7th City, Poker Flat and Trapez among others. A DJ since 1996, Jeff is 
also the only American DJ currently represented by the elusive Kompakt 
organization. He is currently dedicated to his first love of DJ.ing,

debut LP.

AK1200
[Planet of the Drums / Orlando Florida] www.ak1200.com
- America.s original jungle/drum n bass don has been
pushing the sound since the music.s initial
incarnation as hardcore breakbeat. As one of the
U.S..s original proponents of breakbeat music, AK
started DJing in 1989, playing electro and other beat
friendly music of that time. In 1990, he opened a
record store in his hometown of Orlando, FL called The
Hottie Shoppe, where he began developing relationships
with burgeoning breakbeat labels such as Suburban Base
and Moving Shadow. Via these early relationships, he
quickly became known in the UK as someone who could
spread the message in America, and by 1991, he was
writing articles and reviews in the classic US Rave.
Around this same time, Dave Minner also gained his
moniker as AK1200 when fellow Floridian DJ Icey
noticed the hyped-up BPM.s of the tunes Dave would
play in The Hottie Shop, and said .You.re playing so
fast that you are like an AK on the 1200.s!. Icey
started throwing raves at The Edge and he would put
.Dave AK1200 Minner. on the flyer. The name stuck ever
since.

Doormouse - Miami, FL
Addict, Distort, Planet-Mu, Epileptik, Violent Turd, Schematic, 
Sublight,
CockRockDisco, Zod

Doormouse has been producing some of the most slammingest sick-ass jams 
since 1852. He used a potato and 4 live chickens. Although all masters 
were destroyed by fire, these recordings live on in the hearts and minds 
of the very dead chickens. Now he is the OG Midwest badass and depending 
on which side of the fence you're standing on, Daniel "doormouse" 
Martinstein is either a complete waste of time or a complete waste of 
space. Imagine camping with Dennis Hopper and he roofies you out in the 
woods somewhere and you wake up sewn to a family of badgers. Well he's 
sicker. Take one part Gloria Estefan, one part DJ Paul, one part Guy 
Lombardo and there you have it. Don't worry, we're not sure either. What 
you witness may not be safe.

Wed Oct 26                     UNSILENT FILM 5                    Cleveland

SynthCleveland will present the 1921 classic silent horror film "The 
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" featuring a new live improvised soundtrack on 
Wednesday, October 26 at 8pm, at Rain Nightclub, 4142 Lorain Avenue in 
Cleveland.

Directed by Robert Wiene, "Caligari" is considered to be one of the 
landmark examples of the German Expressionist style (i.e. "Nosferatu", 
"Faust", "Metropolis"). The film is enigmatic and highly stylized, with 
a twist ending that M. Night Shyamalan wishes he had used -- madness, 
love, murder and sonambulists -- all set against a carnival side-show 
backdrop.

This is the fifth in a series of "UnSilent" films -- old movies with an 
added improvised live score -- performed this time by SynthCleveland 
members Steven K. Smith, Thieves Like Me, tofu, dust_head and 
fluxmonkey.

Spinning before and after the film will be special guest DJ Feima from 
WCSB's "F2" show.

SynthCleveland is a resource group for area electronic musicians holding 
meetings and presenting workshops related to electronic music.

Rain Nightclub is located at 4142 Lorain Avenue (216-651-4100). For 
directions go to: http://tinyurl.com/5cfyr

Admission (21+) is Free.

TWISTED INDIVIDUAL 
DRUM + BASS // Formation // Grid Recordings  UK 

Twisted Individual (aka Lee Greenaway) is a talented
producer hailing originally from Croydon, South
London. Lee got into dance music at a very early age
and like many used to buy tape packs from his local
record shop to hear the freshest tunes. He liked what
was happening to Jungle/Drum & Bass so saved up his
money and brought himself a pair of T1210's and a
mixer and began to teach himself to mix. Once he was
confident enough he started to play at a few parties
and on local radio stations such as Shadow FM and
Flight FM; he still plays as a regular guest on London
based station Ruud Awakening. 

MC QUESTION MARK 
INTELLECTUAL & RHYTHMIC // MICTLAN // SCIENCE // LOS
ANGELES

One of the most recognized and beloved voices of the
North American drum 'n' bass scene, MC Question Mark
is one of the original driving force of the
still-growing sound on these shores. 

Born and raised in the Peckham suburb of southeast
London, England, Question Mark, nee Devon Andrew
Morgan, moved to Los Angeles, California in 1987.
Pushed to the United States on the insistence of his
parents, it was a way to get Question Mark out of the
distracting elements of his surroundings and
encouraging him to attend college Stateside. Once
settled in Los Angeles, Question Mark completed a
degree in business administration at Los Angeles Trade
Tech College and California State University Los
Angeles.

DESTINY666: RETURN TO THE gRAVE!
The Docks Nightclub .. Toronto, ON, Canada
Four Rooms .. One Evil Vibe!
On Oct 29th, 2005 it is time once again to enter the evil lair. To 
travel through the dark city and across the river Styx to a place on the 
very shores of hell. It is a place where demons of the wheel will force 
your feet to move in an ever more frenzied fashion, faster and faster 
until the energy of your very soul is laid waste on the dance floor. It 
is a place where as the clock strikes 12 and the witching hour is upon 
us, we shall drag the best costumes from the flaming pit and parade 
their last vestiges of tattered humanity for all to see. We shall judge 
who shall ascend to world of bliss and who shall be cast down into 
damnation. If thee is deemed to be worthy and be dressed as the

SUBURBAN KNIGHT AKA JAMES PENNINGTON . DARK ENERGY [ DETROIT .
UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE . DARK PRINT . SOG RESEARCH ]
This man's contributions to the world of techno and house are
unequivocal. Pennington started out as a college party DJ alongside
Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May, and Eddie Fowlkes.Then he,
made his way into the world of techno, forever changing it with his
hit " The Art of Stalking" on the fledgling Transmat label.

As a member of Saunderson's group Inner City when they recorded their
biggest hits, "Big Fun" and "Good Life," he later went on to join the
Underground Resistance (UR) camp and as a producer and touring DJ. His
first vinyl offering for UR was the massive techno hit "Nocturbulus
Behavior."

 He has since started his own label, Dark Print, in which the first
release "Tech-hieroglyphics," was a compilation album of Detroit and
Belgian artists. Pennington chooses to release new music less
frequently than many of his peers, describing his releases as
"essential lessons." His performances as a DJ are no different: rare,
much sought after, and not forgotten.

DAN PHYSICS [ BROOKLYN . SONIC GROOVE . CREME ORGANIZATION . CONRAIL ]
Just back from touring in Brazil for a few months, funkshun welcomes
Dan Physics to philadelphia for the third time. A veteran DJ and
Producer from NYC, Dan mixes a blend of Techno, Industrial, Acid
House, and EBM, with a focus on keeping the mood deep, grooving, and
dark.


CRAIG SOPO [ BALTIMORE VIA DETROIT ]
Recently relocating from Detroit to Baltimore, Craig Sopo brings over
6 years of experience behind the decks. Originally intrigued by the
percussive sounds of the Code Red and Drum Code labels, in the last
few years his sets have become more and more acidic, drawing from
labels as diverse as Krax, Communique and Definitive. Having been a
regular on the popular Michigan State University radio show The
Mechanical Pulse, his sets are not one to miss. Come out to hear this
native Detroiter's first show on the East Coast.

TOM++ [ PHILADELPHIA . FUNKSHUN]
Stripped-down funk and rhythm, always unpredictable. Choosing from a
wide arragement of sounds, Tom++ brings a clever warmth and emotion to
the moment, while revealing an insightful view of the reality we
inhabit. It is his continued dedication to advancement of all aspects
of the music, community, and culture that keeps Tom++ near the heart
of the Philadelphia and Global electronic music movement.

TREVITT [ PHILADELPHIA . FV . AUTOMATIC ]

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

Subject: {pb-cle} Saturday@Havana - NORM TALLEY

SATURDAY@HAVANA
10.22.05

[PETE] - 10pm - 12am - Passion of the Crates

[NORM TALLEY] - 12am to 2am - Beatdown Sounds; Detroit, MI

Known as the Silent Warrior of the deep and funky sound of dance music, Norm 
Talley has slowly yet steadily become a staple in the ears of dancefloor 
addicts in Detroit. Consistency would be an understatement. Talley shares a 
history as part of the West 6 Mile Detroit breed that came of age during the 
last days of Disco, and spent his teen years reveling in the New Age that 
was the early 1980s. Frequenting the hottest new dance clubs, like LUomo 
and Studio 54, in and around Detroit during this transitional and 
experimental decade, he was an active member in the movement that was 
Electronic Music in Detroit. Yet, like his current partners, Norms roots 
remain in Soul, Funk, and Disco  rendering his DJ style one of soulful, 
vocal melodies laced over infectious percussion, and those undeniable bass 
lines that distinguish the BeatDown Sound from a sea of others - with the 
occasional Afrobeat rhythm of course. He is also known as the Gospel House 
guru at home.

People that saw Norm the last time he was in Pgh know that his DJ set is an 
experience that should not be missed ... but do me a favor ... Norm will 
also be playing at the closing reception of the STATIC FREE art installation 
at the SPACE GALLERY on Liberty Ave. downtown.  Check him out there too and 
check out the art while you're at it.  Support the ones that make nights 
like this possible.  Thank you.

This Saturday October 22nd:
7 - 11pm at SPACE 812 Liberty Ave.
11pm - 2am at CLUB HAVANA 5744 Ellsworth Ave.

Both events are F R E E.

See you all Saturday night,

Jason C.

Subject: {pb-cle} Live PA in Columbus Tonight!

Aight fokes...I know you're not gonna believe
this...but guess what... My procrastinating ass
finally stepped up to the production plate. Wish me
luck because tonight will be my first time performing
a live PA with Jesse and Nick (Project XOX). I will be
programming the 909 and 626. If any of you can make it
down, it sure would great because I could use the
moral support and see some nice familiar faces. I'm
all nervous and shiat over here =P Also, Nick and I
just recently made a DnB track and hopefully he'll get
it uploaded in the near future so you all can take a
listen. The people that have heard it so far seem to
really like it which makes me extremely happy and
motivated to keep doing more. Those machines are fast
becoming musical crack to me ;) I'm finding out real
quick that there's no better feeling than making yer
own stuff. I finally feel like I'm really
accomplishing something musically - it's cool to sit
back and say to yourself "dang I did THIS." (!!!!)
Aight sorry, I know I'm talking like a complete dork
now, but this feels good dammit and I gotta tell some
fokes!!

Cheers

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Live PA in Columbus Tonight!

we never even made it to the venue...we were chilling with some friends on 
the north side of c-bus when i got the call that the party was shut down.

we're all pretty dissapointed, especially sherry...she was looking forward 
to playing.

at least we didnt have to deal with the cowboy cops...id probably be in jail 
right now if they tried to hustle me outa there w/o my gear.

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who came out Friday. Once again It was great getting everyone together to hear some good quality music. Thanks to Davey from Y-Jak, Melloman, Bad Lieutenant, Mike from Random Movment, and Kevin from Basic Operations, you guys all tore it up. Despite the rainy weather and my car getting broken into, I still had a blast. Steph and I are very appreciative for all the support, thanks again to everyone!

When someone asked that question while we were leaving another person  
replied "cops".  In the end that is all the answer you need.

I guess the given reason is narcotics.  As soon as we got there the  
police had already arrived and were trying to shut it down then with  
stating those typical key words "capacity", "fire marshall", etc.

Pity too as it was a really great party, and we did not even get to  
see XOX  :(

I was surprised it still wansn't really cramped in there, like can  
barely move packed in.  Plus, if there was an emergency, they could  
open up the garage doors and you could completly empty that place  
within a couple mins.  Heck, most people were out within a few mins  
of shutting it down, even with people just sorta meandering towards  
the exits.  Although I don't think garage doors are considered when  
determining occupancy

My first party shut down by cops... joy

ahh, that does explain it a little bit.  I was towards the front in  
the second room and heard they cop mention something about get out  
now more cops are on their way or something to that extent.

I'm beginning to wonder if THAT was the plan for the utah raid.  If  
they went all out and raided a place, they'd know that it would  
spread around the "rave scene" and pretty much scare the crap out of  
people so now if people see cops busting a party they're going to go  
"holy shit, this is going to end up like utah" and get the heck out  
of there.

saturday, november 19 :: discoturkey @ abbasso

A special thanksgiving fundraiser

It's the time of year to give thanks for all we have and to help 
those less fortunate.

Come to discoturkey with a minimum of 5 canned goods or a $10 
check payable to the Greater Cleveland Food Bank, and we'll give 
you a 70-minute CD copy of the Habersham Live set, recorded at 
Abbasso on October 8. (Arrive early -- only a limited number of 
copies will be pressed. And, no, we won't give you a copy of the 
set unless you show up and donate.)

We'll also have other giveaways and prizes for those who 
contribute the most to the Food Bank, including vinyl and gift 
certificates to local stores.

In 2004, the Foodbank distributed over 17 million pounds of food 
to more than 400 hunger programs, which included area food 
pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other agencies such as 
child-care centers and homes for the elderly. This was enough food 
for member agencies to serve over 13 million meals to hungry 
individuals. The Food Bank provides 37,000 meals EACH DAY to 
hungry people in our community. For each dollar donated, the 
Foodbank can distribute four meals.

Nearly half of the people that receive these meals are either 
children under the age of 18 or seniors citizens over the age of 
65. A recent Ohio Hunger Task Force report found one million 
children suffering from chronic hunger in Ohio. Children need 
healthy food to learn and grow. The meals provided by the 
Cleveland Foodbank and its member agencies may be the only 
nutritious food that some of these hungry children receive.

That is a fantastic idea...love it.  Even better than the bring one can, get a $1 off type of things.  It'd be nice to see this raise quite a decent amount of food/money.  I think that banks are supposed to be really low this year too.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Wed Oct 26                     UNSILENT FILM 5                    Cleveland

SynthCleveland will present the 1921 classic silent horror film "The 
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" featuring a new live improvised soundtrack on 
Wednesday, October 26 at 8pm, at Rain Nightclub, 4142 Lorain Avenue in 
Cleveland.

Directed by Robert Wiene, "Caligari" is considered to be one of the 
landmark examples of the German Expressionist style (i.e. "Nosferatu", 
"Faust", "Metropolis"). The film is enigmatic and highly stylized, with 
a twist ending that M. Night Shyamalan wishes he had used -- madness, 
love, murder and sonambulists -- all set against a carnival side-show 
backdrop.

This is the fifth in a series of "UnSilent" films -- old movies with an 
added improvised live score -- performed this time by SynthCleveland 
members Steven K. Smith, Thieves Like Me, tofu, dust_head and 
fluxmonkey.

Spinning before and after the film will be special guest DJ Feima from 
WCSB's "F2" show.

SynthCleveland is a resource group for area electronic musicians holding 
meetings and presenting workshops related to electronic music.

Rain Nightclub is located at 4142 Lorain Avenue (216-651-4100). For 
directions go to: http://tinyurl.com/5cfyr

Admission (21+) is Free.

Raoul Belmans - Aroma Records, Belgium

Raoul Belmans, well known from his DJ residency at FOOD, started to DJ 
on a local radio station in '91 and this developed into playing on 
several stations and at funky bars. His first real deal parties started

experimenting on some studio equipment.

Raoul's DJ gigs these days reach all over Belgium and also France,

(Space), Robert-Johnson Club, La Belle Angele (Ultragroove), Discotonic 
(The Kitchen), Queen (Respect, Confusion), Open house, Rex Club... all 
in between he's also taking care of his label AROMA.

Under different project names like Swirl People, Swirl Peepz, Cozy 
Creatures, Different Noodles and Tiger Sprouts, Dimitri and Raoul have

TWISTED INDIVIDUAL 
DRUM + BASS // Formation // Grid Recordings  UK 

Twisted Individual (aka Lee Greenaway) is a talented
producer hailing originally from Croydon, South
London. Lee got into dance music at a very early age
and like many used to buy tape packs from his local
record shop to hear the freshest tunes. He liked what
was happening to Jungle/Drum & Bass so saved up his
money and brought himself a pair of T1210's and a
mixer and began to teach himself to mix. Once he was
confident enough he started to play at a few parties
and on local radio stations such as Shadow FM and
Flight FM; he still plays as a regular guest on London
based station Ruud Awakening. 

MC QUESTION MARK 
INTELLECTUAL & RHYTHMIC // MICTLAN // SCIENCE // LOS
ANGELES

One of the most recognized and beloved voices of the
North American drum 'n' bass scene, MC Question Mark
is one of the original driving force of the
still-growing sound on these shores. 

Born and raised in the Peckham suburb of southeast
London, England, Question Mark, nee Devon Andrew
Morgan, moved to Los Angeles, California in 1987.
Pushed to the United States on the insistence of his
parents, it was a way to get Question Mark out of the
distracting elements of his surroundings and
encouraging him to attend college Stateside. Once
settled in Los Angeles, Question Mark completed a
degree in business administration at Los Angeles Trade
Tech College and California State University Los
Angeles.

DESTINY666: RETURN TO THE gRAVE!
The Docks Nightclub .. Toronto, ON, Canada
Four Rooms .. One Evil Vibe!
On Oct 29th, 2005 it is time once again to enter the evil lair. To 
travel through the dark city and across the river Styx to a place on the 
very shores of hell. It is a place where demons of the wheel will force 
your feet to move in an ever more frenzied fashion, faster and faster 
until the energy of your very soul is laid waste on the dance floor. It 
is a place where as the clock strikes 12 and the witching hour is upon 
us, we shall drag the best costumes from the flaming pit and parade 
their last vestiges of tattered humanity for all to see. We shall judge 
who shall ascend to world of bliss and who shall be cast down into 
damnation. If thee is deemed to be worthy and be dressed as the
best in your category, ye shall trade your soul for CASH and VIP (Vile 
Inbred Paragon) access to ALL Destiny & TR events (including WEMF) for 
one turn of the calendar year. As the night grows later and the blood 
red moon is upon us once more, our witches and warlocks will cast their 
evil magic about the room and turn all clocks back one hour. Where once 
it will have been two, it shall revert back to one. The decadence and 
debauchery will continue late into the early morning?
ON HALLOWEEN .. THIS IS THE BIG ONE! Missing out would be a GRAVE 
mistake!

SUBURBAN KNIGHT AKA JAMES PENNINGTON . DARK ENERGY [ DETROIT .
UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE . DARK PRINT . SOG RESEARCH ]
This man's contributions to the world of techno and house are
unequivocal. Pennington started out as a college party DJ alongside
Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May, and Eddie Fowlkes.Then he,
made his way into the world of techno, forever changing it with his
hit " The Art of Stalking" on the fledgling Transmat label.

As a member of Saunderson's group Inner City when they recorded their
biggest hits, "Big Fun" and "Good Life," he later went on to join the
Underground Resistance (UR) camp and as a producer and touring DJ. His
first vinyl offering for UR was the massive techno hit "Nocturbulus
Behavior."

 He has since started his own label, Dark Print, in which the first
release "Tech-hieroglyphics," was a compilation album of Detroit and
Belgian artists. Pennington chooses to release new music less
frequently than many of his peers, describing his releases as
"essential lessons." His performances as a DJ are no different: rare,
much sought after, and not forgotten.

DAN PHYSICS [ BROOKLYN . SONIC GROOVE . CREME ORGANIZATION . CONRAIL ]
Just back from touring in Brazil for a few months, funkshun welcomes
Dan Physics to philadelphia for the third time. A veteran DJ and
Producer from NYC, Dan mixes a blend of Techno, Industrial, Acid
House, and EBM, with a focus on keeping the mood deep, grooving, and
dark.


CRAIG SOPO [ BALTIMORE VIA DETROIT ]
Recently relocating from Detroit to Baltimore, Craig Sopo brings over
6 years of experience behind the decks. Originally intrigued by the
percussive sounds of the Code Red and Drum Code labels, in the last
few years his sets have become more and more acidic, drawing from
labels as diverse as Krax, Communique and Definitive. Having been a
regular on the popular Michigan State University radio show The
Mechanical Pulse, his sets are not one to miss. Come out to hear this
native Detroiter's first show on the East Coast.

TOM++ [ PHILADELPHIA . FUNKSHUN]
Stripped-down funk and rhythm, always unpredictable. Choosing from a
wide arragement of sounds, Tom++ brings a clever warmth and emotion to
the moment, while revealing an insightful view of the reality we
inhabit. It is his continued dedication to advancement of all aspects
of the music, community, and culture that keeps Tom++ near the heart
of the Philadelphia and Global electronic music movement.

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

Sat Nov 19                       DISCOTURKEY                      Cleveland

saturday, november 19 :: discoturkey @ abbasso

A special thanksgiving fundraiser

It's the time of year to give thanks for all we have and to help 
those less fortunate.

Come to discoturkey with a minimum of 5 canned goods or a $10 
check payable to the Greater Cleveland Food Bank, and we'll give 
you a 70-minute CD copy of the Habersham Live set, recorded at 
Abbasso on October 8. (Arrive early -- only a limited number of 
copies will be pressed. And, no, we won't give you a copy of the 
set unless you show up and donate.)

We'll also have other giveaways and prizes for those who 
contribute the most to the Food Bank, including vinyl and gift 
certificates to local stores.

In 2004, the Foodbank distributed over 17 million pounds of food 
to more than 400 hunger programs, which included area food 
pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other agencies such as 
child-care centers and homes for the elderly. This was enough food 
for member agencies to serve over 13 million meals to hungry 
individuals. The Food Bank provides 37,000 meals EACH DAY to 
hungry people in our community. For each dollar donated, the 
Foodbank can distribute four meals.

Nearly half of the people that receive these meals are either 
children under the age of 18 or seniors citizens over the age of 
65. A recent Ohio Hunger Task Force report found one million 
children suffering from chronic hunger in Ohio. Children need 
healthy food to learn and grow. The meals provided by the 
Cleveland Foodbank and its member agencies may be the only 
nutritious food that some of these hungry children receive.

Subject: {pb-cle} mac softwares...

yo, y'all...

i have a friend who's interested in doing up some amateur-type mix
cd's or podcasting, but has NO (and I mean NONE) dj/production skills.

she uses a mac, and has seen me use Acid to just line up tracks to
fade into each other, etc. she wants something very
similar...something that's just click-and-drag to allow her to line up
mp3's just to segue them together, just like Acid, but for mac.

can anyone point me in the right direction?

thanks.

Garageband, or Ableton?

Garageband comes free with the new Macs, dunno about the (slightly) older o=

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mac softwares...

Meant to reply to all, but...

MIKE SPEAKS! Anyway, if we're talking something for simplicity in podcasting, I'd recommend Ableton Live on the Mac side of things. Garageband is actually a difficult concept for people who arent familiar with the concept of multitrack recording. Live, on the other hand, you just drag sound clips in, and start recording. Click the clips you want to play when you want them to, etc. The only difficult part is the render (difficult is an overstatement), then the MP3 conversion/XML/upload. I could write a quick bash script to encode it, but the real "hard part", is getting it into a podcast friendly rss feed. I've been doing it a while (somewhere within the first 100 podcasts listed on winer's/curry's site), but I've still to find something that actually makes it easy. Odeo is going this way, but I dont think they know how to do it right. I've given thought to doing it myself, but my mac sucks enough to where I dont use it. I tried java too, but its way too bloated to start recording hour shows and what not. Just use Live, render to wav, drop to an mp3 encoder, and pay for a copy of Radio. Its the most simple way to do it, although giving money to dave winer makes me want to kill myself. Ok, going to go back to my walking pneumonia and a martini. - mike

Thinking on it...

If they can spend the cash, Ableton.  It's fucking awesome, and the
later versions can pretty much beatmatch it for them.

yummay!

For sale: Britains underground city
Maurice Chittenden

WELCOME to Cold War City (population: 4). It covers 240 acres and has 60
miles of roads and its own railway station. It even includes a pub called
the Rose and Crown.

The most underpopulated town in Britain is being put on the market. But
there will be no estate agents blurb extolling the marvellous views of
the town for sale: true, it has a Wiltshire address, but it is 120ft
underground.

The subterranean complex that was built in the 1950s to house the
Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillans cabinet and 4,000 civil
servants in the event of a Soviet nuclear attack is being thrown open to
commercial use. Just four maintenance men are left.

Property developers looking for the ultimate place to get away from it all
need not apply. The site has a notional value of 5m but there is a catch.
It is available only as part of a private finance initiative that involves
investing in the military base on the surface above.

Already two uses are being considered: a massive data store for City firms
or the biggest wine cellar in Europe. More outlandish ideas put forward
include a nightclub for rave parties, a 1950s theme park or a reception
centre for asylum seekers. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has ruled out any
suggestion of using it to store nuclear waste or providing open public
access because of the dangers that still lurk below.

Man, that would be dissapointing to have all that and it just ends up =20=

as a wine celler.  I could see maybe leasing out parts of it.  using =20
it for secure data storage is a great idea once they control the =20
humidity, but you don't need 240 acres to store information, unless =20
they use it to store old movies and stuff like we're using salt mines =20=

for.  wish they had pictures of the place.
