Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} dj ESP Woody McBride (+ more) mp3s online

The mp3s from our show last week are online.  All were recorded 
straight from the mixer to 320k mp2 then edited down to 192k mp3. 
Please be kind on the server and download once!

Direct downloads at:
http://www.midnightmixer.com/media/albums/ftp/mp3/062505/

The better experience at:
http://www.midnightmixer.com/media/thumbnails.php?album=14

vrillusions took some great pictures that can be found at:
http://parties.vrillusions.com/gallery/woodymcbride

------------

dj ESP Woody McBride (192k mp3 ~45min ~60mbytes) [part 1]
dj ESP Woody McBride (192k mp3 ~50min ~72mbytes) [part 2]

http://www.djesp.com

A djs dj mix that spans multiple genres using complicated rhythms and 
basslines. The recording sounds good, but pumping out of T.F.L. many 
subwoofers was great.

------------

Mike Parker (192k mp3 ~50min ~67mbytes)

http://www.mike-parker.net

The man behind the curtain of Geophone Records.  Capital T 
Techno...Mostly original material - clangy with deep kicks.

------------

Dub Mos Papa (192k mp3 ~ 55min ~75mbytes)

Dub mixdown of borrowed + original material.  Re-cut with digital 
precision and analogue f/x.

------------

t3 (192k mp3 ~55min ~73mb)

Warmup to zero in the T.F.L. sound system...House to tech house to 
electro to techno.

------------

Raver's Edge - mix + interview (56k mp3 ~120min ~50mbytes)

http://www.raversedge.net

Archive of the Raver's Edge mix + interview on WRUW 91.1 FM.

DJ Vitruvius hosted Mike Parker for an hour long mix of classic euro 
/ prog rock.  As Woody put it - Techno before electronics met punk 
rock.  Parker's set begins about 30 minutes into the mp3. Afterwards 
near the 1 hour 30 minute mark Vitruvius interview's Mike Parker and 
dj ESP Woody McBride.  Unfortunately, Woody was on a bad microphone 
and there is some distortion...

So yeah...

I have no idea what the event night is called, and no idea who is playing.  
I think these guys just whipped something together, in which I dont really  
mind. Its not Nikki's thing anymore, and Sonic is doing it now...  but  
anyways.

If you guys have nothing to do, Ill be playing at Rain tonight from, 12:30  
- 1:30. From what I understand, it's going to be a dnb/breaks night there.

Here's the club information if anyone is interested.

Thanks..

Rain Nightclub
4142 Lorain Ave.
Cleveland Ohio

I'm surprised that Chris L. hasnt said anything about this album. I had  
heard it a few different times, and it grew pretty heavily on me..  Check  
this girl out...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.I.A.

I can only best describe this as electro regge.. It's different though.  
Influenced by alot of different styles. Here's a few clips of what she  
sounds like...

Well, its definitely something different.  Not a big fan of songs  
where the vocals are the main focus of the song... usually (Yeah,  
happy hardcore has a lot of vocals).  Like that galanga track.  The  
vocals seemed to distract from it IMO.  An instrumental version of  
that would be good, though.

Two new and very exciting releases are available today including the worlds=

Full details, files, and links @ http://www.experimedia.net

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

EXP019 - PHASE FOR STEREO - FLASHFREEZE EP
**Ableton Live v5 DJ Ready!!**

Three high quality electro-disco dancefloor tracks. Two dark, funky, and=20
exotic tracks from Phase For Stereo and a spaced out disco remix by Cache,=
=20
the artists behind Portland's Clusterflux Records. Tracks worthy of the=20
finest vinyl are offered to you here for free download in completely=20
lossless FLAC format. For those willing to sacrifice sound quality for=20
download speed mp3 and ogg vorbis formats are also available.

AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER ANYWHERE!!!

The FLAC formatted files have been prepared to be ready to DJ in ABLETON=20
LIVE v5. Simply download the .asd files and place them in the same director=
y=20
as the FLAC versions of the tracks. Now when you load the tracks in ABLETON=
=20
LIVE v5 they will be pre-analyzed and warped into perfect sync ready to mix=
=20
and match.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------

EXP020 - FIELDTRIQP - EIDOLON EP
**Bonus Video Included!!**

Much has been said about the work of this individual. His praises have been=
=20
sung on many a messageboard throughout the electronic community. On this EP=
,=20
we get to see front and center what makes Fieldtriqp tick. Oily, serpentine=
=20
pads and stop/start drum work prevail; carving a winding path over the=20
course of 20 minutes. As the recording unfolds, meandering melodies and=20
breathy percussion delicately paint a watercolour landscape before the=20
listener's eyes. The tones shift, and we find ourselves enveloped in a dark=
=20
and foreboding place; alone, and with no guide.

Bonus video for Lost City Sidewalks by Miles McGaffen included.

Ep originally recorded for Project168.

Well, its definitely something different.  Not a big fan of songs  
where the vocals are the main focus of the song... usually (Yeah,  
happy hardcore has a lot of vocals).  Like that galanga track.  The  
vocals seemed to distract from it IMO.  An instrumental version of  
that would be good, though.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

FRIDAY . SATURDAY . SUNDAY

ONTARIO, CANADA
www.wemf.com - 416-631-8821


Once again, the biggest, best and longest running festival of its kind 
touches down in Ontario, Canada. We promise the ultimate music weekend 
featuring hundreds of performers from around the world. Continuing the 
tradition that began at the very start of the electronic music scene, 
Destiny returns with its boldest production to date and very special 
milestone - our 50th major event!

Over the past decade, some of the biggest names in dance music have 
graced the stages of WEMF. In total, over 200 artists are booked for 
2005. Two main stages cater to Trance, House, Techno, Breaks, DnB & 
Jungle with smaller sub stages providing hardcore, psychedelic and 
ambient beats to complete the full spectrum of electronic dance sounds.

Traveling to WEMF each year has become the thing to do for those who 
want an experience of a lifetime. In the past decade, well over 100,000 
people have experienced the WEMF phenomenon. License plates from 20 
states and 5 provinces were observed last year and busses were chartered 
from across the Northeast. If electronic music is your thing this is 
your event!

Sat Jul 16                        P.U.M.P.                       Pittsburgh

[whaaaa? a pgh party?]

P.U.M.P. (Pittsburgh Underground Music Production) is Pittsburgh's first
annual underground music celebration on 07.16.05. Department of Energy,
Nightbreed Productions, Koala-tea, Nightvision, Full House, Electrasoul,
and Death x Stereo are just some of the crews working to make this event
one to remember.

First, Nightbreed Productions and Department of NRG bring their
specialty to the table and made it possible for this event to be held in
a virgin venue.  This multi room WAREHOUSE with over 15,000 square feet
will provide you with adequate dancing space, multi room environments,
and most of all provide that underground feeling associated with
underground music.

Second, Koala-tea brings on their skills and makes it possible for some
of our big bookings for this show. Plus, Koala-tea is bringing out some
of their drum n bass talent, along with Pittsburgh's own Death x Stereo
crew, the drum n bass for this event will be off the hook.

Third, Electrasoul along with Electralight will be providing sound and
lighting for this event. With FOUR stages already confirmed and state of
the art lighting and visuals, this event holds lots of suprises for
everyone.

Last, local crews such as Nightvision and Full House represent most of
our local lineup for this event. Progressive House, break beats, techno,
all over the place, these crews will be sure to keep the crowd
movin...all night long.

Event runs from 9pm till 6am. Admission will be $20 all night plus on 
site, secure parking available. Vendors please contact Department of 
Energy at 412-708-0473 before May 31st. Any further questions please 
contact djkelvinhertz@yahoo.com

Jul 14-18                         TEKNIVAL                          Ontario

http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/

A Teknival is a free non-commercial weekend-long gathering, a 
celebration of the DIY (do it yourself) attitude, and an experiment in 
non-hierarchical organization. The festival encourages group autonomy 
and self-sufficiency.

Teknival is free from an entrance fee, but also from authority and 
leadership. Each individual or group is free to get involved however 
they want, for the love of what they do.
Ontario.s 2005 Teknival will take place July 14-18, *NEW* Location 
southeast of Bancroft area. Some pics of the location here!

Driving directions will be released in early July

it is LEGAL for us to be on Crown Land provided we play by some simple, 
and often complimentary rules.
1) the regular laws apply regardless of permit
2) no permanent damage or changes are allowed without a permit
3) no profit may be made on Crown Land without permit
4) we can be there for as long as 3 weeks
5) it is for use by all members of the public, which means we can not 
limit access to it and must share it!

so the law supports the gift-exchange free spirited essence of teknival!

Bring enough food, water, shelter and supplies for yourself and everyone 
you bring up. Get together with friends into camps to share resources 
and responsibility.

MURAT 'LIVE' . Newark / Detroit . Data - Method 11:11

Techno comes in many forms. There's the melodic, textured Detroit techno 
of Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson. There's the tougher 
spacey European variety of Luke Slater, Dave Angel, and C.J. Bolland. 
Then there's the hards-as-nails, compressed sounds of Stockholm 
pioneered by Cari Lekebusch, Adam Beyer, and Joel Mull. Murat's work 
falls into the latter category.

Based in Detroit, Murat was the first artist to be signed to Tim Baker 
burgeoning Elephanthaus label. Move, his first release for the label, 
was an underground techno hit, and led to further releases on European 
labels such as Method and Primate. The follow-up, Transpose, revealed a 
more mature techno sound that will find favor with fans of labels 
Underground Resistance, Planet E, and Metroplex.

ADAM X . NYC / Chicago . Sonic Groove

In his DJ performances and track production, Adam X's sound is best 
described as hard, EBM and industrial inspired dance-floor techno & 
electro. Adam X penetrates, educates and infuses his audience with a 
real energy, often drawing from dark & sexual themes, through the 
mastery of the electronic music medium he has gained from a prolific 
career.

Adam currently has a chameleonic approach to his artistry, playing at 
Industrial events like Maschinenfest in Germany, to playing famous 
techno clubs the next night like Rex Club in Paris. His own productions 
also combine the two genres, containing elements of both in a single 
track. From haunting minimal loops and deep, sexy basslines, to the 
pounding industrial teknoid beats that have become his trademark, Adam 
X's material reaches a deep and subconscious part of the listener, often 
evoking an emotional response which is especially visible on the 
dance-floor. Fifteen years in, Adam's quest of producing, DJing, and 
releasing music has the same ideology as day one, that ideology being to 
continually break new boundaries within electronic music.

SHAWN RUDIMAN 'LIVE'' . pittsburgh . technoiraudio

In 1989 Shawn Rudiman started production work with ed Vargo on THD 
(Total Harmonic Distortion). This ebm/elektro unit became quite popular 
in the ebm/ industrial scene of the early to mid 90's, releasing 4 
full-length albums, countless remixes and compilation releases on 
European and domestic labels. Along with this, a fascination with old 
music machines developed that led him to techno. In 1997 he decided to 
retire the long worn out industrial-ebm ideals. this led to a move 
towards pure rhythm and sounds, and a relocation to Pittsburgh, PA the 
transition period was difficult due to a scaling back of sound layers 
and refinement of rhythms, but results proved positive. At the same 
studio production began with techno, so did live sets. Sets of non-stop, 
all live improvised techno, as fluid and smooth as any dj set, but 
entirely flexible in direction and tempo. He then started Hyperviny 
Records with Trevor Combee. This led to meeting Anthony Shakir and that 
to releaseing tracks for Dan Bell and 7th City etc. He and friend Jwan 
allen have since started a new label, Technoir Audio. Today he resides 
somewhere in the ghettos of Pittsburgh and plays live on a regular basis 
in the mid-west area. "one of the best live p.a.'s i've ever seen."- 
Anthony "shake" Shakir

TOM++ . philadelphia . funkshun

Stripped-down funk and rhythm, always unpredictable. Choosing from a 
wide arragement of sounds, Tom++ brings a clever warmth and emotion to 
the moment, while revealing an insightful view of the reality we 
inhabit. It is his continued dedication to advancement of all aspects of 
the music, community, and culture that keeps Tom++ near the heart of the 
Philadelphia and Global electronic music movement. In 2005 his sights 
are set on studio production and studying the art of a 'hardware based' 
live performance.

RICK MIKO . philadelphia . funkshun

In 1993 Miko brought his blend of funky house and disco to The Freight 
Yard and established himself as a resident deejay there. This club was 
located in a warehouse in Allentown, PA and is known for the legendary 
all night events and weeklies that took place at a time when the rave 
scene, as it is known today, was still in its infancy. Every Friday 
night from 1993-1997 and also at the historic all night Freight Yard 
parties, Miko would deejay along side artists such as Joey Beltram, 
Laurent Garnier, Scott & Robbie Hardkiss, Keoki, Wink, Frankie Bones, 
Adam X, Feelgood, Scott Henry, DB, Dieselboy and many more.

In a time when techno music was the standard, Miko defied the norm by 
giving the crowd an awesome house set while at the same time keeping 
interest through a unique energy of driving techno sounds.

Sat Jul 23                   LAWNCHAIR GENERALS                   Cleveland

Coming to Wish Saturday July 23rd

LawnChair Generals (Viva, Westbound, Lowdown)

Seattle transplants Peter Christianson and Carlos Mendoza, better known 
as the Lawnchair Generals, have been generating beats out of their 
self-made studio for the past two years. Based on the brief amount of 
time the duo has spent manning the controls, the success they have 
attained is staggering. As goes the old adage, it is quality, not 
quantity that breeds such success; along with their blinding talent, 
both behind the decks and in the studio, and a little luck thrown in for 
good measure, the Generals have blazed their way into the record crates 
of the world's top DJs and onto internationally distributed mixes 
compiled by the industry's most prolific jocks. "The egalitarian nature 
of this industry is what allows us to completely transcend the fact that 
we're from a town that has been mostly rock oriented," says Carlos. "It 
allows us to be on equal footing with people who have been making great 
house music for a long time."

Lawn Chair Generals likely represent the next creative event in 
underground house music, a sound carefully crafted unlike much of the 
slapped together economy of the dance music prevelant to date. Carlos 
Mendoza and Peter Christianson met in 2000 and almost immediatelly began 
experimenting with the possibilities of house music. Their very first 
experiment yielded their first release on Viva Recordings, "The Great 
Escape". The pair was pleasantly surprised when this release garnered 
the praise of national and worldwide heavyweights alike. Charted in 
publications by the likes of Mark Farina and Colin Dale of the BBC, and 
broken out on dance floors by Johnny Fiasco, DJ Heather, Doc Martin, Rob 
Mello and more all over the world, their "West Coast meets Chicago" 
sound has garnered this pair more attention than they expected...Remixes 
for Viva, Deepfunk and Amenti extend this duo's sound to the works of 
other emerging underground talents such as Hanna, Rhythm Slaves and 
Alexander East.

Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher // metalheadz, swerve, intasound

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
Energy FM. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MCs, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldies club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CDs for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to
recognition and respect.



dj FIXX
// florida breaks pioneer! // bottom end records, afterdark records

One of the pioneers of the funky breaks movement across the nation, DJ Fixx
has proven just that with his incredible production and intense DJ
performances. After basically carrying the Kaleidoscope Music label for over
3 years, Fixx now runs his independent monthly label, Bottom-End Records -
now one of the top 5 best-selling break beat labels in the country. With
over 120 12" record releases and 4 massively-distributed CDs under his belt,
DJ Fixx has one of the strongest followings of any other break beat
producer. Whether he?s touring in a city near you or simply in the studio
producing his next anthem, Fixx always brings Nothing But Bottom!

Destroying trends, smashing through adversaries, and perfecting the art of
being; Illy emcee's album "Living in the Moment" is here to forge ahead, and
rearrange the current sound of hip-hop. Geared towards the educated
consumer, this album is laced with engaging lyrical content and rock solid
production. Working with German based hip-hop phenom, Minnox, as well as
Philly based artists, Dstar, J Smooth, and Ducketts; Illy focuses on
bringing back quality and creativity to music.

Moving from Baltimore, to Philadelphia proved a prosperous relocation.
Linking up with the likes of Armmani, Sharpness, and Messinain, he could be
heard at Diesel Boy?s infamous club night, Platinum. Illy also sets it off
the second friday of every month, with Mental Sharp at "the free hip hop
party".

On the production side, Illy forms the "Brigade" with Noisemachine and
Tension. They aim to please with quality tracks ranging from catchy dance
floor killers, to melodic, vibing jams. Illy's work can be heard on Phylum
recordings and the knowledge mix cd (may 2005 mixed by silver), as well as
and collabortations with the likes of SS, Skibadee, MC Trip, Killa Kella,
Spor and the Black Sun Empire.

Subject: {pb-cle} Confessions of a cut & paste artist.

God's Little Toys
Confessions of a cut & paste artist.
By William Gibson

full article at http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/gibson.html

"Meanwhile, in the early '70s in Jamaica, King Tubby and Lee "Scratch"
Perry, great visionaries, were deconstructing recorded music. Using
astonishingly primitive predigital hardware, they created what they called
versions. The recombinant nature of their means of production quickly
spread to DJs in New York and London.

Our culture no longer bothers to use words like appropriation or borrowing
to describe those very activities. Today's audience isn't listening at all
- it's participating. Indeed, audience is as antique a term as record, the
one archaically passive, the other archaically physical. The record, not
the remix, is the anomaly today. The remix is the very nature of the
digital.

Today, an endless, recombinant, and fundamentally social process generates
countless hours of creative product (another antique term?). To say that
this poses a threat to the record industry is simply comic. The record
industry, though it may not know it yet, has gone the way of the record.
Instead, the recombinant (the bootleg, the remix, the mash-up) has become
the characteristic pivot at the turn of our two centuries."


hey, lets not turn this into a mp3 vs cdj vs vinyl vs 8-track vs
reel-to-reel vs peer-to-peer discussion, but i know you will.....

Subject: {pb-cle} Russian stuff, really cool actually

This would be a wicked CPU case:

http://oldradio.onego.ru/IMAGES/TRANS/volna_b.jpg

the whole thing is some russian 'gallery exhibit' of some sort that i
found on boing boing...

http://oldradio.onego.ru/foy.htm is the main page, it has just russian
equipment from what i can deduce.

some things are really random, like this one:
http://oldradio.onego.ru/ARTICLES/RADIO/tgk_real_l.htm
which looks really cool, but what the F is it?

and:
http://oldradio.onego.ru/IMAGES/TSIFR/l3_3_b.jpg
which looks like something trout would pull out at an outdoor party
while you're grilling brats at a tent, and commence to hooking it up
to a car battery at which time the faint sounds of some acid techno
would start eminating with a monotone russian voice repeating a phrase
over and over.... well maybe not all that, but it definitely looks
cool.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} last week for Fuse-In stuff...

I thought about that, but I can't seed more than anything like 3 at a  
time before my connection goes to crap.  guess if we had enough  
people that we know could keep it seeded for a while, post the  
torrent links around enough places, although i think just having  
people get it within a couple weeks is a good compromise.  I can have  
about 120gb of bandwidth allocated just to files.vrillusions.com and  
still have enough bandwidth left over to take care of the rest of the  
sites I have.  and it automatically kicks over to a "bandwidth  
exceeded" section if it goes over,

Subject: {pb-cle} cops and dj's

as we all know being a dj can be a risky and sometimes
criminal act.  (how many were arrested in michigan?) 
how does a pig get a way with being a rave dj?  is it
deep infiltration into a scene?  if they were a dj
first does he use his bookings as a reference to get
that promotion or hiring on a task force?  

next time you see a pig with vynil ask yourself, is he
here for the music or is he here to infiltrate us.

its a little known fact that all police officers like beating up
criminals as their illegal crime of choice. none like doing drugs,
or dancing. those guys are weeded out in the hiring process.

Where the hell did this come from anyways? Was there something recently

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} yes in michagin

I do believe what matthew is talking about is when me,
dan (skillz) and our whole posse got arrested for the
rave act in michigan. I was playing when the cops came
in and arrested us for dancing and having a good time.


Turns out the promoter (Jello) was also hustling all
the pils too. (see fucktard)

 The cops made a few buys and got a warrant.

 Acutally those of us who didn't have anything on us,
all 118 of us are being represented by the ACLU on
this. The cops did not handle the situation correctly.
It's a bullshit charge. The cops were stealing  money
from the bars register. When asked what we were being
arrested for the cops told us to "shut the fuck up".
This was just one of numerous things that voilated our
civil rights. Therefore we are filing a civil suit
against the city of flint.

                                               two

as far as the rest of the shit he's talking
about.??..???..??.. I have no fucking clue.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} thats why you have frineds do secuirty

Using off-duty police for front-door security is (or at least was)
absolute genius, as having them search incoming ravers for drugs gives
you relative certainty that the promoter did their best to keep
violence and illegal things outta their party.

As far as using friends with concealed carry permits, if they ever
need to use those guns, you'll spend most of the rest of the decade in
court.

Perhaps constables are a good compromise.

Try going to http://www.comcast.net/help/contact/ and posting the 
following in the comment box, after selecting "Report Internet Service 
Abuse".
_____________________________________________

Please read the below message, posted to the 'pb-cle raves' mailing 
list. (http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/)

Frankly, this excessive (and completely unprovoked) racial slander 
offends me to an extreme degree. In your Acceptable Use Policy, it is 
stated that "Comcast reserves the right to immediately terminate the 
Service and the Subscriber Agreement if you ... post, store, send, 
transmit, or disseminate any information or material which a reasonable 
person could deem to be ... vulgar, hateful, racially or ethnically 
offensive".
I fully expect that Comcast will terminate service for such an 
aggressive violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.

cops are paid to do security at raves.

if cops aren't there, then niggers come and hold up the promotor
at gun point and rob him of all his profits, which is what happened
to brian at the last Family Affair.

niggers also like to tail promotors home to loot his house of
records and break into your car and steal your car stereo
or even your entire car if you don't have a car alarm,
which is what happened to me before.

niggers also like to go through your garbage and steal your
personal information for identity theft, which is also what
happened to me before.

i've been involved in promoting for events since 1990 and i can
tell you for a fact cops had been at events since 1990, they're
paid security.  promotors also use US Marines and Army
National Guard as undercover paid security.  In case any
thugs show up and try to jump the promotor or DJ's and
rob them for their records or cash or car.

grow the fuck up, it's 2005, you can't trust niggers nowadays.

niggers have also blackmailed promotors, club owners, and
casino owners threatening to spread malicious and perverse
rumors about them if you don't pay them insurance money.

there are security videos of niggers pick pocketing patrons,
stealing cars, getting in violent gang fights causing property
damage, even niggers abducting girls and putting them in
trunks!

like i said, it's 2005, you have no idea, how evil niggers are!
niggers were behind 9/11, the baltimore sniper shooting,
bringing in AIDS, Anthrax, West Nile Virus, identity
theft, as well as the typical nigger drive by shooting,
raping, car jacking, and robbing people at gun point!

a license to carry a concealed weapon in pennsylvania only gives you the 
right to CARRY the weapon, not to USE it.

Subject: {pb-cle} Pics from 45 Thieves last weekend

This was a great show, good music all night. 45
Thieves put on one hell of a show. They even busted
out the guitars and played over top of some killer
ragga. Finally got to meet Twinhooker and Paulie
Walnuts and pick up copies of their dubs. Great guys
good tracks.
pics are up at http://photos.yahoo.com/damianlauderbach

Not in america, All the cops have to do is say terrorist and you no

I'm waiting for the 'raves support terrorism' campaign to happen...

*dramatic public service annoucement voice*
"People at raves, do drugs.  Proceeds from drugs are used to fund 
terrorist activites.  Don't do drugs? well by just going to these 
parties the money you pay at the door also goes to fund terror.  So by 
going to raves, you support terrorism.  Next time you're friends ask you 
to go to a rave, tell them "You do not support terrorism."  The 
government will thank you.  Instead sit at home on your fat ass and 
watch the latest reality shows.  Ohh and smoke some cigarrettes, too" 
*quick voiceover about cigarrettes are bad*

ya'll are seriously late.) they had the fucking bombest laser ive

if anyone at all in the country cared about raves, that might
happen. but they dont. so it wont. considering how few raves
actually happen at all let alone in this area, i have no idea why
this list is still actually here. its fun being here though, just
for those times like now when people come out of the woodwork with
their plur talk and other rave related nonsense pretending like
its 1998. those days are so long gone.

Rob is my boy.  Met that guy at WMC at and heard his set.  He was dropping some
serious house.  Great person, and he knows what's up when it comes to house. So
assuming that Rob will be at all of those places below, I'll try to drop in some
time next week if things work out at my end.  In the meantime, give Rob a shout
for me.

I probably should take more pictures of people but the "LASER BEAMS"

touch. indeed they can be.

but to answer your question, i suppose that would depend on the character
i was playing. if i was playing a barely legal bimbo, then yes, i do look
different from how i sound, because im not barely legal, and im not an
idiot. if i was playing an ass-stomping dominatrix, then no, i look
exactly as i sound.

Ohhhh you were trying to be witty and "burn" my girlfriend and I. See I was confused, seeing as how my life is none of your business. Go deal with your own drama ( i am sure you have copious amounts) and don't bring it here. Also before you go accusing anyone of being a cop you should do your research. I am sure that damian has spent years building up his cover by going to school and working at Home Depot. You know I have heard that Lowes is actually the secret training spot for all the DEA agents. I always thought you were smarter than that..
                      two
 
P.S. Don't you know that the list is a drama free place where people can come here and talk about things as equals? GEEZ

They still make that prejungle hardcore breakbeat.... Check out warehouse www.warehousewax.co.uk
The guy john (vinyljunkie), who runs it, still produce that style with Austin (see suburban base). He also sells old stuff, both off the site and on ebay.
 
I am working on assembling a set or two of that style myself............trying to stick with a ragga feel tho...

i think thats the only straight up HHC record i own. i do have

I'd say vtb both of them, but it's occasionally
amusing to read the ramblings of wackjobs.  Or listen
to messages that they leave on people's voicemails.

BREAKS IN THE CODE
The Sound That House Built
[12 July  2005]

by Chris Toenes

I first experienced house music in a  historical way, looking back 
into dance music's roots for that first initial  energy flash of the 
immediacy of post-disco revelry. My interest was less  nostalgia than 
archaeology; trying to dig up the influences of musicians I  already 
loved, from the European minimalists to the permutations of house  
spread throughout abstract digital music. Much like the traditional 
view  of roots music, where blues and rural American music is 
considered the  cornerstone, and primitive rock bands their offspring, 
I sought out the  early pioneers who set up the actual beat 
architecture and developed the use  of equipment to meet their needs, 
the basics of which remain unchanged. As  many people do with roots 
archival series like blues reissues, I was in  search of those beat 
manipulators and mixers responsible for the DNA of  dance music in 
nearly all its forms.

Were it not for the foundation  of house music, the bedrock of dance 
music rooted in the vocal phrasings and  melodic hooks of disco, 
electronic music would not find itself embracing the  simple joys of 
tension and release once again. Is there an inherent  difference in 
how electronic music circles view the transition from original  style 
to its progression into a new music genre? Does music elitism end  
with rock and jazz? In dance music, it is hard to fully ignore the 
past;  it is ingrained in most basic forms of the music. Just as blues 
remains the  kernel of information from which rock and roll derives 
its structure and  soul, its core components under constant 
rearranging and assimilation, house  is the codex of most modern 
electronic dance music. House has been absorbed,  bastardized and is 
now being embraced anew by a younger generation of  musicians, DJs and 
labels since its inception in the late '70s and early  '80s in Chicago 
clubs like The Warehouse by an exuberant young resident DJ,  Frankie 
Knuckles. A new style was born when club goers started referring to  
Knuckles' mixes, in a cribbed nickname of the club where he played 
the  music, "house" music.

Compare the situation to rock music. Purists take  offense at the 
hawking of a derivative rock band's music as wholly original  despite 
its permanent dependence on the blues and early black rhythm and  
blues. The similarity in relationship ends there, though, for dance  
music. Very infrequently are there aesthetes who praise the original  
un-distilled, untainted house music or its myriad other subgenres 
that  also resent the modern interpretations and offshoots. In dance 
music, these  progressions and metamorphoses seem natural and 
expected, beats piling up on  one another, various producers and DJs 
experimenting endlessly with  overlapping styles.

Endless splinter genres shot off those original 4/4  time signatures 
balanced over a stroking bass line and various samples,  including 
those from the blues. Now longstanding musical sections on their  own, 
Acid, Ambient House, Chicago, Deep House, Garage, Ghetto House, Hip  
House, Progressive, Tech House all derive from the original Chicago  
strains. Contemporary updates include the minimal styles 
predominantly  developed in Germany, like microhouse and schaffel. 
When disco dancing was  not merely style over substance, DJs like 
Larry Levan were creating new ways  to find that sweet spot for the 
dance floor epiphany. Levan and Knuckles,  later called the "Godfather 
of House Music", maintained a deep friendship  spending formative long 
nights in clubs like The Gallery and The Loft. Just  as the recent 
crop of garage rock of White Stripes clones lifted from the  barebones 
of blues riffs long plundered since Keith Richards and Jimmy Page  put 
picks to strings, house music has been recycled and used as a jumping  
off point for countless styles of electronic dance music and pop.

The  best recent parallel of this is the co-opting of the style and 
sometimes,  the actual sound of post-punk bands from the '80s like 
Gang of Four or The  Pop Group by eager young groups being splashed on 
the front pages of  magazines like they were the second coming. Franz 
Ferdinand, Bloc Party and  The Rapture all took this original sound 
from some of their heroes, and did  their best to reflect it. For 
electronic musicians the level of mimicry of  those working in the 
trenches from only turntables and maybe a mixer in the  golden age to 
laptop gear-heads clicking and cutting at the slide of a mouse  
morphed into a new thing, like a giant sponge soaking up the 
essential  nutrients of dance music's now storied past.

Electronic music critic and  DJ Philip Sherburne discussed the flux of 
genre and labels in a 2001 entry  for his Needle Drops column for  
<http://www.neumu.net/needledrops/data/00008_needledrops.shtml>Neumu.net,  
titled "Click-Hop, Microsound and the Delicate Balancing Act of the  
Virtual Genre". Sherburne has a deep interest in modern 
interpretations  of house and disco, amidst the ever-disintegrating 
world of sub-sub-genres  and style categorization. He explains his 
experience after creating a term  for a new subset of artists' work, 
"I even took my own stab at the game of  genre, coining the term 
MicroHouse for an article I wrote for The Wire in  which I attempted 
to delineate a sub-strain within house and tech-house  music, one 
especially popular among German artists. There, I chose to use  the 
term as a descriptor. I wasn't making grand claims about this  
particular style, but imposing a new word was the easiest way of 
saying  not only what these artists all had in common, but also how 
their tracks  differed from other forms of house music".

The owners of German label  Kompakt remain primary torchbearers of the 
mutant, reduced house style,  often known as the "Cologne Sound", 
where the beats and often vocal bits are  stripped down to their 
essentials. Michael Mayer, Kompakt co-founder and  artist, has 
developed several unique house and disco approximations with his  
contemporaries like Reinhard and Wolfgang Voigt, Richard Villalobos, 
and  Isolee. Another substrata, more recently emerged, is schaffel, 
influenced by  glam rock.

Among the stacks, there are plenty of artifacts of the  original 
sounds of electronica and dance culture emerging. A recently  released 
compilation of Acid House from Chicago, Acid: Can You Jack? came  out 
on the British label Soul Jazz. With a luxurious biographical book on  
the central players, like Larry Heard, Marshall Jefferson, and 
Phuture,  the organizers propose an alternate tale of house, wherein 
Frankie Knuckles  plays a more secondary role, and the music also 
included fragments of "'60s  rock and '80s new wave". The frizzed-out 
tweak of acid house made a leap for  dance music, lending it a punk 
edge. Elaborate reissues like these,  including others on Nicky 
Siano's The Gallery, a series on early black, raw  disco, Disco Juice, 
act as a codex to the sounds of today, especially for  people entering 
dance music from a rock or otherwise outside  position.

The world of dance music finds progression to be natural,  without 
much backlash as to purity of old forms. In the '90s, the climate  
when so-called "intelligent dance music", a distinctly pompous term, 
was  coming to fruition, dance purists seemed to become polarized 
against the  technology obsessives, who sought abstract structures and 
disjointed digital  constructions over direct move-your-body beats. 
Now there is a return to  embracing the egalitarian beats of house and 
its offspring. Knuckles once  said, "House is disco's revenge". Now 
that rockers have their limitless  resources for the roots of the 
music, from the African griots to timeless  riffs, dance culture is 
warming up to its own eclectic histories, while  showing its 
progression and opening the doorway to this after-hours world a  
little wider for all to  see.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} The Sound That House Built

this guy's assesment is actually pretty spot on for the most part,
despite actually missing the modern artists he should have.
instead of talking about microhouse and kompact, he needs to
understand people like theo parrish and underground resistance.
those guys have knowledge and respect for the past but twist it
into new things on a constant basis. the references they make in
their music are enough to give you a pretty solid foundational
understanding of dance music. 

i do agree that right now people are starting to look at the
continuum of dance music as a whole instead of looking at just one
small area of its timeline. looking only to the future is just as
dangerous as looking only to the past. there's a medium in there.
and not suprisingly, that medium was ORIGINALLY present in house
music. those original deejays would play the most ridiculously new
and weird shit as well as the old jams from the past and they
would see it as one thing. in a way i consider the music i spin to
be "fundamentalist house". ill drop shit in from 1970 next to shit
thats on white label. ive learned that from watching some of the
most amazing deejays: theo parrish, norm talley, anthony shakir,
marcellus pittman, rick wilhite, metro area, derrick may, etc etc.
for these people genre is irrelevent. they play serious house
music, in the manner of which the word was originally coined. 

here's the liner notes from that acid house comp on soul jazz that
this guy references:

http://www.timlawrence.info/linernotes/2005/acidhousesj.php

thats a hell of a story right there. it tells the story of what
real house music is. its not some lame r+b type soul music at 120
BPM, its not sasha and digweed, its not what most people think of
when they hear the words "house music". 

tim lawrence's book "love saves the day" is ridiculously
important. it and "last night a deejay saved my life" and "techno
rebels" should be required reading by every single individual who
listens to any dance music. mr lawrence's forthcoming book is
going to be so awesome, i cant even wait.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Do you liberals even know what you are defending in this war?

Ok, liberals.

Let's have a crash course (excuse the pun) in what you are defending:
Islam.


Fact:  Islam is bent on the destruction of all world beliefs except Islam,
  from Christianity to Secularism.

Fact:  Islam wants to kill any and all people that don't practice Islam or
dare to speak out against it.

Fact:  Islam wants to kill any and all people that drink alcohol, because
Islam believs the consumption of alcohol is a sin.

Fact:  Islam laughs at what you and this country calls "womens rights",
and demands that all women be completely covered except for their eyes,
and anyone who disagrees shall be killed.

Fact:  Islam laughs at what you and this country calls "womens rights",
and demands that all marriages be pre-planned by the families and their
Islamic church.

Fact:  Islam is 100% pro-life, and will kill anyone and everyone that
supports abortion.

Fact:  Islam is for a full, unbridled theocracy, where nothing is taught
by anyone except for Islam.

Fact:  Islam is for a full, unbridled theocracy, where all laws are based
off of the Koran.

Fact:  Islam believes, and supports, that any and all people considered
"infidels" (which includes EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU on this list) should be
killed without question.

Fact:  Anyone who questions any of the above statements is considered an
"infidel" by Islam.


This is the religion that you are defending?  Everything I just said can
be backed up repeatedly with their religious text and their actions.  Spin
it however you want, but if you support and apologize for Islam, you are
supporting killing yourself and your nation.

Just so you know pb/cle goers know.

(Nikki's email to me..)

im not shit talking. i made a joke about two's girl, and since i actually
know him, i didnt think it was a huge deal. as far as the damien stuff
goes, i was asking if there was any merrit to the rumor, since i figured
one of you know-it-alls would potentially have imput.

im quite aware of what the list is for, thankyouverymuch.

most of this crap is totally irrelevant, smarmy banter between a handful
of people who think their -and only their- opinions matter, and that is
why ive been subbing and unsubbing to the list for years.

furthermore, if you arent interested in what i have to say, then dont read
it. duh.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Jul 16                        P.U.M.P.                       Pittsburgh

[whaaaa? a pgh party?]

P.U.M.P. (Pittsburgh Underground Music Production) is Pittsburgh's first
annual underground music celebration on 07.16.05. Department of Energy,
Nightbreed Productions, Koala-tea, Nightvision, Full House, Electrasoul,
and Death x Stereo are just some of the crews working to make this event
one to remember.

First, Nightbreed Productions and Department of NRG bring their
specialty to the table and made it possible for this event to be held in
a virgin venue.  This multi room WAREHOUSE with over 15,000 square feet
will provide you with adequate dancing space, multi room environments,
and most of all provide that underground feeling associated with
underground music.

Second, Koala-tea brings on their skills and makes it possible for some
of our big bookings for this show. Plus, Koala-tea is bringing out some
of their drum n bass talent, along with Pittsburgh's own Death x Stereo
crew, the drum n bass for this event will be off the hook.

Third, Electrasoul along with Electralight will be providing sound and
lighting for this event. With FOUR stages already confirmed and state of
the art lighting and visuals, this event holds lots of suprises for
everyone.

Last, local crews such as Nightvision and Full House represent most of
our local lineup for this event. Progressive House, break beats, techno,
all over the place, these crews will be sure to keep the crowd
movin...all night long.

Event runs from 9pm till 6am. Admission will be $20 all night plus on 
site, secure parking available. Vendors please contact Department of 
Energy at 412-708-0473 before May 31st. Any further questions please 
contact djkelvinhertz@yahoo.com

Jul 14-18                         TEKNIVAL                          Ontario

http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/

A Teknival is a free non-commercial weekend-long gathering, a 
celebration of the DIY (do it yourself) attitude, and an experiment in 
non-hierarchical organization. The festival encourages group autonomy 
and self-sufficiency.

Teknival is free from an entrance fee, but also from authority and 
leadership. Each individual or group is free to get involved however 
they want, for the love of what they do.
Ontario.s 2005 Teknival will take place July 14-18, *NEW* Location 
southeast of Bancroft area. Some pics of the location here!

Driving directions will be released in early July

it is LEGAL for us to be on Crown Land provided we play by some simple, 
and often complimentary rules.
1) the regular laws apply regardless of permit
2) no permanent damage or changes are allowed without a permit
3) no profit may be made on Crown Land without permit
4) we can be there for as long as 3 weeks
5) it is for use by all members of the public, which means we can not 
limit access to it and must share it!

so the law supports the gift-exchange free spirited essence of teknival!

Bring enough food, water, shelter and supplies for yourself and everyone 
you bring up. Get together with friends into camps to share resources 
and responsibility.

MURAT 'LIVE' . Newark / Detroit . Data - Method 11:11

Techno comes in many forms. There's the melodic, textured Detroit techno 
of Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson. There's the tougher 
spacey European variety of Luke Slater, Dave Angel, and C.J. Bolland. 
Then there's the hards-as-nails, compressed sounds of Stockholm 
pioneered by Cari Lekebusch, Adam Beyer, and Joel Mull. Murat's work 
falls into the latter category.

Based in Detroit, Murat was the first artist to be signed to Tim Baker 
burgeoning Elephanthaus label. Move, his first release for the label, 
was an underground techno hit, and led to further releases on European 
labels such as Method and Primate. The follow-up, Transpose, revealed a 
more mature techno sound that will find favor with fans of labels 
Underground Resistance, Planet E, and Metroplex.

ADAM X . NYC / Chicago . Sonic Groove

In his DJ performances and track production, Adam X's sound is best 
described as hard, EBM and industrial inspired dance-floor techno & 
electro. Adam X penetrates, educates and infuses his audience with a 
real energy, often drawing from dark & sexual themes, through the 
mastery of the electronic music medium he has gained from a prolific 
career.

Adam currently has a chameleonic approach to his artistry, playing at 
Industrial events like Maschinenfest in Germany, to playing famous 
techno clubs the next night like Rex Club in Paris. His own productions 
also combine the two genres, containing elements of both in a single 
track. From haunting minimal loops and deep, sexy basslines, to the 
pounding industrial teknoid beats that have become his trademark, Adam 
X's material reaches a deep and subconscious part of the listener, often 
evoking an emotional response which is especially visible on the 
dance-floor. Fifteen years in, Adam's quest of producing, DJing, and 
releasing music has the same ideology as day one, that ideology being to 
continually break new boundaries within electronic music.

SHAWN RUDIMAN 'LIVE'' . pittsburgh . technoiraudio

In 1989 Shawn Rudiman started production work with ed Vargo on THD 
(Total Harmonic Distortion). This ebm/elektro unit became quite popular 
in the ebm/ industrial scene of the early to mid 90's, releasing 4 
full-length albums, countless remixes and compilation releases on 
European and domestic labels. Along with this, a fascination with old 
music machines developed that led him to techno. In 1997 he decided to 
retire the long worn out industrial-ebm ideals. this led to a move 
towards pure rhythm and sounds, and a relocation to Pittsburgh, PA the 
transition period was difficult due to a scaling back of sound layers 
and refinement of rhythms, but results proved positive. At the same 
studio production began with techno, so did live sets. Sets of non-stop, 
all live improvised techno, as fluid and smooth as any dj set, but 
entirely flexible in direction and tempo. He then started Hyperviny 
Records with Trevor Combee. This led to meeting Anthony Shakir and that 
to releaseing tracks for Dan Bell and 7th City etc. He and friend Jwan 
allen have since started a new label, Technoir Audio. Today he resides 
somewhere in the ghettos of Pittsburgh and plays live on a regular basis 
in the mid-west area. "one of the best live p.a.'s i've ever seen."- 
Anthony "shake" Shakir

TOM++ . philadelphia . funkshun

Stripped-down funk and rhythm, always unpredictable. Choosing from a 
wide arragement of sounds, Tom++ brings a clever warmth and emotion to 
the moment, while revealing an insightful view of the reality we 
inhabit. It is his continued dedication to advancement of all aspects of 
the music, community, and culture that keeps Tom++ near the heart of the 
Philadelphia and Global electronic music movement. In 2005 his sights 
are set on studio production and studying the art of a 'hardware based' 
live performance.

RICK MIKO . philadelphia . funkshun

In 1993 Miko brought his blend of funky house and disco to The Freight 
Yard and established himself as a resident deejay there. This club was 
located in a warehouse in Allentown, PA and is known for the legendary 
all night events and weeklies that took place at a time when the rave 
scene, as it is known today, was still in its infancy. Every Friday 
night from 1993-1997 and also at the historic all night Freight Yard 
parties, Miko would deejay along side artists such as Joey Beltram, 
Laurent Garnier, Scott & Robbie Hardkiss, Keoki, Wink, Frankie Bones, 
Adam X, Feelgood, Scott Henry, DB, Dieselboy and many more.

In a time when techno music was the standard, Miko defied the norm by 
giving the crowd an awesome house set while at the same time keeping 
interest through a unique energy of driving techno sounds.

Sat Jul 23                   LAWNCHAIR GENERALS                   Cleveland

Coming to Wish Saturday July 23rd

LawnChair Generals (Viva, Westbound, Lowdown)

Seattle transplants Peter Christianson and Carlos Mendoza, better known 
as the Lawnchair Generals, have been generating beats out of their 
self-made studio for the past two years. Based on the brief amount of 
time the duo has spent manning the controls, the success they have 
attained is staggering. As goes the old adage, it is quality, not 
quantity that breeds such success; along with their blinding talent, 
both behind the decks and in the studio, and a little luck thrown in for 
good measure, the Generals have blazed their way into the record crates 
of the world's top DJs and onto internationally distributed mixes 
compiled by the industry's most prolific jocks. "The egalitarian nature 
of this industry is what allows us to completely transcend the fact that 
we're from a town that has been mostly rock oriented," says Carlos. "It 
allows us to be on equal footing with people who have been making great 
house music for a long time."

Lawn Chair Generals likely represent the next creative event in 
underground house music, a sound carefully crafted unlike much of the 
slapped together economy of the dance music prevelant to date. Carlos 
Mendoza and Peter Christianson met in 2000 and almost immediatelly began 
experimenting with the possibilities of house music. Their very first 
experiment yielded their first release on Viva Recordings, "The Great 
Escape". The pair was pleasantly surprised when this release garnered 
the praise of national and worldwide heavyweights alike. Charted in 
publications by the likes of Mark Farina and Colin Dale of the BBC, and 
broken out on dance floors by Johnny Fiasco, DJ Heather, Doc Martin, Rob 
Mello and more all over the world, their "West Coast meets Chicago" 
sound has garnered this pair more attention than they expected...Remixes 
for Viva, Deepfunk and Amenti extend this duo's sound to the works of 
other emerging underground talents such as Hanna, Rhythm Slaves and 
Alexander East.

Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher // metalheadz, swerve, intasound

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
Energy FM. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MCs, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldies club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CDs for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to
recognition and respect.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} input - just sayin. 



are you seriously THAT fucking retarded that you cant see my name spelled
correctly right next to the line that says "from"? i thought i already
said im not that nikki girl from rain, but you werent paying attention, so
ill say it again: i am not nikki. im nicki. and yes, im the girl who beat
up stephanie in front of bsides.

>>She is Matt Andersons girlfriend

thanks, frank. i thought maybe i was more than just so-and-so's
girlfriend, but whatever. p.s. his name is matthew.

also? if i had meant to clarify all of this to the entire list, dont you
think i would have had the gumption to reply to the entire list instead of
just replying to you, jea leigh? but since you have taken it upon yourself
to "clear up some drama" or whatever and post my email, i guess ill just
respond to everyone.

and finally, if two has his head so far up his ass that he would get that
uppity and defensive over a freakin' joke, thats his problem, and
obviously some deep rooted insecurity of his own. maybe that is why he
cheats and goes to swingers clubs because hes "not that into" his
girlfriend or whatever.

and that is all i have to say about that.

i always thought this list was for party's and such,what happened?   
Everytime i actually read one of these messages..someone is bitching,and its  always 
stupid ass shit!,I haven't heard anything informative on here in many  
years....i am out of town quit a bit,but when im on the road touring,im still  
watching all the gay asses on the list (that's right jesse,im  talking bout you 
too!)in shitty cleveland,and the burgh still,and they dont  have anything positive 
to talk about on this list,its so fuckin  annoying,lets talk abunch of smack 
over the computer,cause we know we cant get  away with it if we were face to 
face?(not trying to start any fights  here......)jesus,somebody please be 
positive?isnt that what the raving crap is  all about?
 
    And who the hell is Tom Cox???,i know ive probably met  him 
somewhere,someway before..........but...damn dude,you love to see your name  all over all 
these messages.
 last time i checked you werent throwin any party's or had any good  advice 
on anything,
so whys your name tagged all over the place??cause Element Squad and Sphere  
arent 
around anymore,sorry to rag on ya...but since your such a "cracker ass

I discovered that I can figure out whether or not I want to read a
post by whether or not there are line-breaks, and relatively

Entropy's the only exception to that rule in years.

Odd.

everyone in pb-cle land should consider themselves damn lucky...im in 
Virgina Beach right now(came to pickup an mpc from an old friend)...you all 
bitch about club raves and the underground "raves"...but at least we have 
them...there is absolutely nothing down here except country, rap, top40, and 
classic rock...the majority of the mullet heads you see drive by in their 
trucks and wranglers are pounding skynard...you couldnt get 10 people down 
here to stay in a club all nite and listen to "techno" music...i doubt any 
of them would last 10 minutes.

so next time you bitch about how things arent like they used to be...be glad 
you have something to bitch about.

Don't think we've had a single post there in a couple weeks, *sigh*.   
Funny thing is, some people on there aren't on this list, so have no  
idea wtf is happening here :)

And if I remembered right, you mention it right under the subscribe  
link to pb-cle that there's an unofficial OT one.  o well.

get over the fact that i spelled "your" name wrong. just because I spelled
it "nikki" doesnt mean im referring to you as the chick from rain retard.
AND youre sooooooooooooooo cool that you beat up stephanie in front of
Bsides btw..

I took it upon myself to clarify since you wouldnt... considering I even
had a few people from the list ask me what the hell youre drama's about
here, so get over it. Your posts are fucking retarded and worthless.

i didnt clarify because i really didnt think it mattered.
you wouldnt care who i was at all if i wasnt someone who either -
a) kisses your ass or b) was a name to drop.
you had people email you regarding what i said? thats lame as fuck. why
didnt you people just ask me? dont you think id know a bit more than
someone who cant even spell my name right?

if you didnt give a shit you wouldnt go out of your way to respond. and im
hardly going to unsub because you are telling me to and being mean to me
on a computer screen.

just sayin.

p.s. valerie?
>>You posted to a public list, so you WERE talking to EVERYONE.  How about
keeping YOUR two cents to yourself, then if you don't want a logical
response such as you don't like it un-sub.

i emailed her privately, and she took it upon herself to post my email to
the entire list. so shut the fuck up if you dont know what youre talking

Subject: {pb-cle} dramaville

Damn people, this hate list thing is getting real old. I dont care if
you dog each other (or me) and spit crap at each other for awhile but
three days of hatelisting on a subject that doesnt even have room for
an opinion is just ghay. I mean if we where arguing the overall
relavance of Tom Cox's exsistance thats one thing but this pointless
jibber and trash about who somebody *may* be is is is is is is is
lame!

So go back to talking about me behind my back and let's get a REAL topic pe=
ople.
Topics worthy of discussion:

4. How harry IS Tom's ass?

3. Which is cooler, deathmetal or hardcore(gabber)?

2. Why do kids who play deathmetal at fetivals out of their cars have
the most glow sticks?

1. Who cares?

a) kisses your ass or b) was a name to drop.
you had people email you regarding what i said? thats lame as fuck. why
didnt you people just ask me? dont you think id know a bit more than

if you didnt give a shit you wouldnt go out of your way to respond. and im
hardly going to unsub because you are telling me to and being mean to me
on a computer screen.

just sayin.

p.s. valerie?
>>You posted to a public list, so you WERE talking to EVERYONE. How about
keeping YOUR two cents to yourself, then if you don't want a logical

i emailed her privately, and she took it upon herself to post my email to
the entire list. so shut the fuck up if you dont know what youre talking

about as off topic as it got, i got sick of these 3 people whining to me
so i closed it down to make them happy.  funny thing is 2 of them were the
biggest culprits of off topic stuff on here.   *shrug*

YOU came to the list with all this bullshit. Im friends with more than
half this list, and no they didnt email me at all... They asked ME,
wondering what all the drama was about. SO in general.. if you wouldnt
have brought it to the list in the first place, then maybe people wouldnt
be asking.

Dude you have more than enough people here asking you to unsub. Here's a
hint, either do it.. or keep this bullshit up and get yourself kicked off.
I highly suggest you have something intelligent to say or dont say it at
all.. end of subject.

there with me the whole time. Thats fuckin cool.

but enuff about me.....You have become on of those

skill you have. At least I haven't embarassed myself
to  the point where I'd feel stupid even leaving my
house. Well not yet.......

And there is a very good reason that I haven't been
out and about  lately (I am sure you were all
concerned). I  have been busting my ass trying to
start this company, which I will unveil soon enuff....

Subject: {pb-cle} party patch kids

i always hated the "party kids" term.  anytime someone uses
it they're trying to attach some innocence to whatever it is they're
doing.  "jerry's kids" you might have sympathy for.  "party kids", no.

(unless of course they're raggedy orphans on a supervised field trip
attending a rave - highly unlikely)    ;p

"man, i'm just a simple ole party kid tryin to get a fair shake in life."

nigga pleeease

a "raver" would be one who frequented "raves".  i can think of about 10
different varieties off the top of my head - the most ferocious being the
ones who would dress up like extreme sesame street characters, but with
a knife in place of a bird beak or something.  i can't believe people harp
on gummie bracelets.  i think those ravers ate "party patch kids" for 
dinner.

: )

>what exactly will decide the end of this list ? (serious question)

that is a really good question. because lord knows its been at
least 1/2 a decade since an emailing list was necessary to keep up
with the local rave happenings. i imagine itll only last till no
one is still posting. which will mean never, since i like
irritating as many people as possible by posting on the internets! 

>before it does end, i think we should definitely do a "best of".

obviously im the best of the pb-cle-raves list. duhhhhhhhhhhh

;P

you may indeed get the award for "most cyber groupies".

i was more talking about posts vs people -

funniest post
post most likely to be from the dea (;p)
most scandalous post
post most likely to have been written by someone on drugs
best late night drunk post
weakest reason to subscribe-post-unsubscribe post
best rebuttal
best example of ebonics

etc

aside from that, i can't think of anything to pick it up.
unless you want to do a 'geeks of pb-cle' calendar  : )

HOW   SEXY   ARE   YO   SOUNDS?

"How Sexy Are Your Sounds" article by Sara Finlayson

Music Style--HOUSE
Audience: Platinum American Express cocaine crowd.
Attire: Sophisticated gals in tight-fitting black lycra and open-shirted
fellows sporting gold medallions. Also big
among the gay community where shirts are usually off.
Motions: Bumping and grinding. Always sweaty.
Sex Status: Everyone likes to "do it" here. A veritable meat market.
Get Laid?: 10 outta 10
                                                                                     

Music Style--JUNGLE/D&B
Audience: Fed-up ex-ravers and hyperactive Hip-Hop heads. Relatively
young, more popular with girls than most
forms of electronic music.
Attire: Hip-Hop meets rave goes for a skate and then joins the Army.
Motions: Flipper-like motions of the hands with a few moves collected
from watching Beat Street. Circle dancer
meets MC Hammer.
Sex Status: Jungle, like other forms of bass-heavy music, is very sexy.
Get Laid?: 6 outta 10
                                                                                     

Music Style--TECHNO
Audience: Dudes who've been in the rave scene way too long.
Attire: What I came in.
Motions: Leaning against the wall discussing why Techno is superior to
every other form of music on the planet.
Sex Status: Too busy talking about Techno to notice.
Get Laid?: 3 otta 10
                                                            
Music Style--HARDCORE/GABBER
Audience: Tweeked out teens. Predominantly frustrated males. Also
popular with serial killers.
Attire: Multiple piercings, wife-beater shirts, baggy trousers, and
short hair.
Motions: Vigorous jumping up and down, pogo'ing, and speaker fucking.
Sex Staus: Stuck midway through adolescent masturbatory phase. Anxious
and feverish dance style suggests an
urgent need to get laid.
Get Laid?: 0 outta 10 (only a mother could love these guys)
                                                                                     

Music Style--GOA/PSYCH TRANCE
Audience: Crusties and anti-establishment trust fund babies
Attire: Matted dreadlocks, tie dye, and sandals remain popular. A faint
whiff of Nag Champa is usually evident.
Motions: Hippie dance style reminiscent of '60s exploitation movies.
Crazy arms motions and rubbery legs usually
point to excessive LSD intake.
Sex Status: Attractive to each other. Hose down before use.
Get Laid?: Depends on the phase of the Moon.
                                                                                     

Music Style--PROGRESSIVE HOUSE/TRANCE
Audience: University students and candy ravers.
Attire: 'E' friendly apparel, including fluffy backpacks, glitter,
pacifiers, and anything resembling a Dr.Suess
character.
Motions: Hands in the air. Eyes rolling back. Occasionally slumped
against the wall.
Sex Status: No thanks...we're in it for the music. Hugs welcome.
Get Laid?: Males: 2 outta 10 (too busy trainspotting), Females: 6 outta
10 (they look great...to dirty old men)

probably when hyperreal shuts down or the internet gets unplugged.  if i 
give it up, it can probably run on autopilot the way i have it setup.  
even the rom would get mailed like clockwork, just not have any events 
in it.

i still have all the archives, just never get around to putting them 
back out there.  hyperreal is low on drive space so i haven't put alot 
of thought into it.

some days i think it should end, others i dont.  *shrug*

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} my once a year post!..enjoy

I think it would be interesting as a life test to let it run the duration. 
Incoming mails from people you barely know for the next 50 years would be a 
interesting twist on ones life and this would be a new experience as we 
would be about the first generation to be able to do this.

self promotion isn't listing cities you've never seen
let alone performed in, that's more likely to be
labeled as gross exaggeration.  i'm giving him the
benefit of a doubt and chalking it up to more of that
sarcasm frank has such a hard time expressing in
writing/print.

frank is a good akron breaks dj.  he should stick to
his music and leave the comedy to someone else.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR:OT:way-off-topic list

i found this funny, i was on one of my off topic lists i'm on.  figured it
was timely with all the pbcleOT discussion yesterday:

"What about the idea of creating Yes Another List, maybe called AHWOT where
people could discuss the space shuttle, jay, and george bush? ( Analog
Heaven WAY off Topic ) so that maybe we could get AHOT back to just off
topic for AH  ( ie - at least music related rantings )."

i still find it funny people trying to set a topic for off topic lists,
thus defeating the purpose.   *shrug*

back to your regularly scheduled spamming.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Do you liberals even know what you are defending in this war?

Quick question.

When did this become a war against Islam?  Last I checked, Bush was trying
to publicly deny that.  If so, then why did we "liberate" Iraq, an Islamic
country.  Why not nuke the whole region?

And why is it that a large chunk of Bush supporters are looking for a (and I
quote Rush Limbaugh here, ironically) "Taliban-style theocracy"?

Do you conservatives even have an idea of why we're supposedly over there
anymore?

Subject: {pb-cle} stupid question

All right.. so I've been out of the loop for a while,
and the list gets so much banter traffic that I can't
keep up too well.. but I was wondering if anybody knew
of open turntable nights anywhere within, say, 90
minutes of Columbus.  I wanna get out there and spin
again some, but I don't seem to know anybody any more...

Cool I would like to get ahold of that, never heard of it. I thought Pump-Up the Volume was really good, I recommend seeing it if you haven't already. You can buy the soundtrack and the book on-line at channel4.com. Oh yeah and when I get some money next month I'll have you try to fix my damn computer.

i didnt clarify because i really didnt think it mattered.
you wouldnt care who i was at all if i wasnt someone who either -
a) kisses your ass or b) was a name to drop.
you had people email you regarding what i said? thats lame as fuck. why
didnt you people just ask me? dont you think id know a bit more than
someone who cant even spell my name right?

if you didnt give a shit you wouldnt go out of your way to respond. and im
hardly going to unsub because you are telling me to and being mean to me
on a computer screen.

just sayin.

p.s. valerie?
>>You posted to a public list, so you WERE talking to EVERYONE.  How about
keeping YOUR two cents to yourself, then if you don't want a logical
response such as you don't like it un-sub.

i emailed her privately, and she took it upon herself to post my email to
the entire list. so shut the fuck up if you dont know what youre talking
about.

Subject: {pb-cle} Techmix At Abbasso - Sept. 17th - Punisher

Saturday, Sept. 17th At Abbasso:

Plate Tectonics Presents TechMix featuring:

Punisher (Seismic Records, Detroit)

Andy James (Berettamusic.com, Digital Goodtime,
Koala-Tea)
Mark Strauss (Plate Tectonics)
Damon Havill and Jamie Tyler (Plate Tectonics)



We've been wanting to bring Michelle "Punisher"
Herrmann in for quite a while, and after hearing her
set at Fuse-In decided we needed to make it happen.
Michelle will be gracing us with a live PA/DJ hybrid
performance. More info and mixes will follow in the
coming weeks. Expect a night of innovative techno,
from minimal to stomping, and possibly even some drum
and bass thrown in for good measure (she played some
live at Fuse:in).

$5 before 2am, $10 after.

21+

10pm - 5am (yeah we're doing afterhours for this one)

Abbasso
1222 Prospect

Whats funny about that whole thing is that if the CIA didn't do the testing 
it did lsd would never have gotten out at the levels it did.  It's hard to 
say if it would never of gotten out though.

I just watched a documentary that came out on canadian public television 
called "LSD: The beyond within".  I recommend it.

Subject: {pb-cle} turntable question

I got a Technics 1200 to replace the Gemini PT-2000 that I was using. 
Now I have two Technics 1200 to spin on.
One of them seems to have more torque or something, is there a way to 
adjust that?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable question

is 1 a m3d and the other a mk2?  I find the m3d's to be slightly lazy. 
Working with the 2 different models at the same time is kinda crazy feeling. 
Although I enjoy the m3d's more because of the lack of dip at 0 pitch.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

MURAT 'LIVE' . Newark / Detroit . Data - Method 11:11

Techno comes in many forms. There's the melodic, textured Detroit techno 
of Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson. There's the tougher 
spacey European variety of Luke Slater, Dave Angel, and C.J. Bolland. 
Then there's the hards-as-nails, compressed sounds of Stockholm 
pioneered by Cari Lekebusch, Adam Beyer, and Joel Mull. Murat's work 
falls into the latter category.

Based in Detroit, Murat was the first artist to be signed to Tim Baker 
burgeoning Elephanthaus label. Move, his first release for the label, 
was an underground techno hit, and led to further releases on European 
labels such as Method and Primate. The follow-up, Transpose, revealed a 
more mature techno sound that will find favor with fans of labels 
Underground Resistance, Planet E, and Metroplex.

ADAM X . NYC / Chicago . Sonic Groove

In his DJ performances and track production, Adam X's sound is best 
described as hard, EBM and industrial inspired dance-floor techno & 
electro. Adam X penetrates, educates and infuses his audience with a 
real energy, often drawing from dark & sexual themes, through the 
mastery of the electronic music medium he has gained from a prolific 
career.

Adam currently has a chameleonic approach to his artistry, playing at 
Industrial events like Maschinenfest in Germany, to playing famous 
techno clubs the next night like Rex Club in Paris. His own productions 
also combine the two genres, containing elements of both in a single 
track. From haunting minimal loops and deep, sexy basslines, to the 
pounding industrial teknoid beats that have become his trademark, Adam 
X's material reaches a deep and subconscious part of the listener, often 
evoking an emotional response which is especially visible on the 
dance-floor. Fifteen years in, Adam's quest of producing, DJing, and 
releasing music has the same ideology as day one, that ideology being to 
continually break new boundaries within electronic music.

SHAWN RUDIMAN 'LIVE'' . pittsburgh . technoiraudio

In 1989 Shawn Rudiman started production work with ed Vargo on THD 
(Total Harmonic Distortion). This ebm/elektro unit became quite popular 
in the ebm/ industrial scene of the early to mid 90's, releasing 4 
full-length albums, countless remixes and compilation releases on 
European and domestic labels. Along with this, a fascination with old 
music machines developed that led him to techno. In 1997 he decided to 
retire the long worn out industrial-ebm ideals. this led to a move 
towards pure rhythm and sounds, and a relocation to Pittsburgh, PA the 
transition period was difficult due to a scaling back of sound layers 
and refinement of rhythms, but results proved positive. At the same 
studio production began with techno, so did live sets. Sets of non-stop, 
all live improvised techno, as fluid and smooth as any dj set, but 
entirely flexible in direction and tempo. He then started Hyperviny 
Records with Trevor Combee. This led to meeting Anthony Shakir and that 
to releaseing tracks for Dan Bell and 7th City etc. He and friend Jwan 
allen have since started a new label, Technoir Audio. Today he resides 
somewhere in the ghettos of Pittsburgh and plays live on a regular basis 
in the mid-west area. "one of the best live p.a.'s i've ever seen."- 
Anthony "shake" Shakir

TOM++ . philadelphia . funkshun

Stripped-down funk and rhythm, always unpredictable. Choosing from a 
wide arragement of sounds, Tom++ brings a clever warmth and emotion to 
the moment, while revealing an insightful view of the reality we 
inhabit. It is his continued dedication to advancement of all aspects of 
the music, community, and culture that keeps Tom++ near the heart of the 
Philadelphia and Global electronic music movement. In 2005 his sights 
are set on studio production and studying the art of a 'hardware based' 
live performance.

RICK MIKO . philadelphia . funkshun

In 1993 Miko brought his blend of funky house and disco to The Freight 
Yard and established himself as a resident deejay there. This club was 
located in a warehouse in Allentown, PA and is known for the legendary 
all night events and weeklies that took place at a time when the rave 
scene, as it is known today, was still in its infancy. Every Friday 
night from 1993-1997 and also at the historic all night Freight Yard 
parties, Miko would deejay along side artists such as Joey Beltram, 
Laurent Garnier, Scott & Robbie Hardkiss, Keoki, Wink, Frankie Bones, 
Adam X, Feelgood, Scott Henry, DB, Dieselboy and many more.

In a time when techno music was the standard, Miko defied the norm by 
giving the crowd an awesome house set while at the same time keeping 
interest through a unique energy of driving techno sounds.

Sat Jul 23                   LAWNCHAIR GENERALS                   Cleveland

Coming to Wish Saturday July 23rd

LawnChair Generals (Viva, Westbound, Lowdown)

Seattle transplants Peter Christianson and Carlos Mendoza, better known 
as the Lawnchair Generals, have been generating beats out of their 
self-made studio for the past two years. Based on the brief amount of 
time the duo has spent manning the controls, the success they have 
attained is staggering. As goes the old adage, it is quality, not 
quantity that breeds such success; along with their blinding talent, 
both behind the decks and in the studio, and a little luck thrown in for 
good measure, the Generals have blazed their way into the record crates 
of the world's top DJs and onto internationally distributed mixes 
compiled by the industry's most prolific jocks. "The egalitarian nature 
of this industry is what allows us to completely transcend the fact that 
we're from a town that has been mostly rock oriented," says Carlos. "It 
allows us to be on equal footing with people who have been making great 
house music for a long time."

Lawn Chair Generals likely represent the next creative event in 
underground house music, a sound carefully crafted unlike much of the 
slapped together economy of the dance music prevelant to date. Carlos 
Mendoza and Peter Christianson met in 2000 and almost immediatelly began 
experimenting with the possibilities of house music. Their very first 
experiment yielded their first release on Viva Recordings, "The Great 
Escape". The pair was pleasantly surprised when this release garnered 
the praise of national and worldwide heavyweights alike. Charted in 
publications by the likes of Mark Farina and Colin Dale of the BBC, and 
broken out on dance floors by Johnny Fiasco, DJ Heather, Doc Martin, Rob 
Mello and more all over the world, their "West Coast meets Chicago" 
sound has garnered this pair more attention than they expected...Remixes 
for Viva, Deepfunk and Amenti extend this duo's sound to the works of 
other emerging underground talents such as Hanna, Rhythm Slaves and 
Alexander East.

24/7 INFO AND DIRECTIONS:
WWW.TONKA4.COM
216.472.3469


On July 24th, in 1999, with help from friends, Sphere Productions 
produced a historical, and reveled, event entitled TONKA. The Agora 
Theater played home to over 1700 party goers, who were in attendance to 
see the likes of Paul Johnson, DJ Dara, DJ Urban, Freaky Flow and 
Flipside, and many others. After the last record was played, TONKA was 
on track to become one of the most talked about events in the history of 
the Cleveland scene.

July 22nd, 2000, Sphere was at it again, invading the Agora Theater, 
utilizing every crack and crevice, filling up 4 rooms with sound, 
lights, and DJ.s, for TONKA II. This time, Cleveland was treated to the 
sounds of The Jungle Brothers, Usual Suspects, Venom, Mephisto Odyssey, 
Sniper and Mystical Influence, Barry Weaver, Steve Stoll, to name a few, 
as well as some of the best DJ.s Cleveland and the region has to offer. 
Another event that went down in history, and attracted fans from as far 
away as Iowa and Nevada.

In the summer of 2001, on July 27th and 28th, the third installment in 
the TONKA series takes on the entire weekend. Friday night.s event was 
held at Peabody.s, and featured the talents of Richard .Humpty. Vission, 
among others, while Saturday.s event showcased a plethora of talent, 
with TONKA staples, Kevin Cunningham and Tik Tak, Ian Mariano and 
Darw_n, Tigger, and Sean Michaels. Although a smaller event and crowd 
than previous years, TONKA 3 showed off the talents of Cleveland, and 
left many partiers with smiles that lasted for months.

In the year 2005..
Sphere Productions returns after a 3 year hiatus, to bring you yet 
again, another event that will make its way into the history books. This 
event will showcase many of Cleveland.s top names as well as up-n-coming 
DJ.s, regional talent, and play host to international icons. With hopes 
to give the needed shock to the heart of the scene, the time is here to 
kick start the first of many events still to come.
Having thrown over 40 one off events, a handful of weeklies, and 
numerous club shows, Sphere Productions joins another old school crew, 
Breakology, to present TONKA 4 on July 23rd.

Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher // metalheadz, swerve, intasound

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
Energy FM. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MCs, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldies club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CDs for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to
recognition and respect.

platetektonix in association with
ohm resistance, acme art company and the lemon house collective present:


S.O.S.

submerged (live PA) - nyc dnb
(ohm resistance, subtitles, obliterati)

Its hard not to feel the impact of Submerged, be it his work with the
legendary Bill Laswell, remixing Herbie Hancock for Sony, or founding
one of the most influential stateside drum n bass labels (ohm
resistance). Also co-founder of the Obliterati label, Submerged has
carved his name in the stone wall of music history with the help of
radio airplay, releases on countless labels, and support from some of
the biggest names in electronic music. Fresh off a US and two European
tours, Submerged will land in Columbus Ohio on 8/26! You don.t want to
miss this rare live PA set of the amazing drum n bass he has become
world renowned for.


temulent - detroit dnb
(ohm resistance, obliterati, canvas, bassdrive, los luchadors de muerto)

Father of the Obliterati imprint and co-founder of Ohm Resistance . the
name Temulent has become synonymous with the no-holds-barred, near-death
drum and bass that he has been spinning and producing for almost a
decade. Fans of his sound can expect nothing less than his trademark
landscapes of bleak paranoia and unabashed aggression. Temulent is
coming to destroy Columbus in true Ohm Resistance style.


enduser - germany dnb/breakcore
(outbreak, ohm resistance, ad noiseam, sonicterror, too many to list)

With the help of radio play from John Peel, Bailey, and the Breezeblock
on Radio 1, a string of great reviews, and the backing of some of the
top names in the hardcore and drum n bass worlds, Lynn Standafer's
musical juggernaut has landed spots working with artists like The Bug,
Panacea, Needlesharing, Soundmurderer, Resonant Evil, NYC hardcore band
Terror, and many others. His recorded output has become the stuff of
legend on respected cult labels such as Ant-Zen, Mirex, Ad Noiseam, The
Bug's Razor's X, and UK drum and bass leader Outbreak. In addition to
Enduser's prodigious output, Standafer is also producing music for
Acclaim US, scoring independent films, and operating his own
experimental drum and bass label, Sonicterror Records

Sat Set 17             THE FUCKING PUNISHER @ TECHMIX             Cleveland

[!!!!!!!!]

Saturday, Sept. 17th At Abbasso:

Plate Tectonics Presents TechMix featuring:

Punisher (Seismic Records, Detroit)

+ More TBA.

We've been wanting to bring Michelle "Punisher" Herrmann in for quite a 
while, and after hearing her set at Fuse-In decided we needed to make it 
happen. Michelle will be gracing us with a live PA/DJ hybrid 
performance. More info and mixes will follow in the coming weeks. Expect 
a night of innovative techno, from minimal to stomping, and possibly 
even some drum and bass thrown in for good measure (she played some live 
at Fuse:in).

This show will be in the $5 range

21+

10pm onward (we'll probably stay open later than normal for this one)

DJ Equal (Ekwal actually) is my little brother Matt. He's not doing 
trance/breaks, I'm not really sure what kind of dnb he spins though. 
Gonna try and make it up there, even through there's bigger goings on 
here, it doesn't get any nuttier than him and me in the same general 
vicinity. This will be a hoot, GO.

The Mk3's had a slightly different motor, with slightly less torque.
They went back to the original motor (I think) with the Mk5's.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable question

It was the slipmats, one had a technics slipmat that's more coarse then 
the numark slipmat that's on the other table.
The one with the technics slipmat was more responsive.

I think a few people are actually headed up from 301 and 240.  :-)

They announce directions/actual venue yet?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} turntable question

It's scary how slipmats can change the feel of a table.  I have been using 
the same slipmats for like 10 years.  When I went to purchase the same kind 
to replace them they didn't feel the same so I kept the old pair.  They look 
nasty as hell.

cost-prohibitive.

BLLLLAAAAAH... if it wasn't bad enough that there's that stupid trend of 
letting people with iPods on PA's around here...

There are a few manufacturers of these things now, I can't remember who 
off the top of my head, but there were a few different ones that came 
out at musikmesse.

Yeah, I'm waiting for someone to make one with pitch control.  Not sure 
how you can go about doing that without doing something like writing the 
file to a flash card and then can slow and speed it up from there. 
Unless maybe you can adjust the pitch through the dock connector, doubt 
it though.  Then we can start having vinyl vs mp3 vs cds vs ipods threads.

The only way is if the mixer had ram and it had a latency/look ahead 
feature.  Still stupid.  Who think things like this up?

There is nothing at all wrong with them using any BSD licensed library
as a starting point for whatever programs they want to create, including
ALAC and their kernel. If the authors hadn't wanted them used in this
way, they could have licensed them GPL.

It's called advertising, and everyone does it.

I'm sure Steve Jobs is sweating bullets that he pissed you off.

You people are stuck in a strange mindset.

The reality of having two sounds sources the size of a
pack of gum that can hold thousands of trax is
incredible. It was only a matter of time before
someone integrated it into the DJ interface, and I'm
sure the pitch controls will be programmed into the
product (or at least the Microsoft equivalent that you
know is on the way).  I'm down with you vinyl
jocks...its the premium medium.  But this type of
technology creates flexibility and efficiency....you
can always have all your music on you, it weighs
nothing, the library is always organized, your iPod
won't melt in the heat at an outdoor venue.  

Could this iPod project end up sucking ass...sure. 
But  this type of interface is on the drawing boards
and will be nailed down.

the money thing is an issue.  you can store thousands of tracks on a
laptop, use one of those outboard dual controllers (allowing for pitch
control with whatever software fits your fancy (like the control unit
for dual cd decks, whatever the hell they're called)... and add a
mixer.  same results and you can browse the internets on your laptop.=20
the ipods cant let you do that yet... wait for the upcoming release of
the "ePod" (i'm sure it's in development, maybe under an even cheesier
moniker)

i was kidnapped by a voodoo witchdoctor and taken to the village of gypsies, 
just south of the hotdog stand.

i think those hotdogs gave me digestive problems.

hey... good seeing everyone as well.... its been too long...

i was skeptical at first, but I ended up having a great time.... thanks to 
the people who showed up, of course.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} EGL 3

bigups to pat, john, and everyone else involved in putting this on...it was
quite cool of them to let us setup our own stage...it was quite surprised at
how loud our 4600 watts was compared to everything else...i thought we were
gonna be overpowered by stage with don's system, the dnb stage, or the
hardcore stage, but after we fired it up, it was perfect, u couldnt hear
anything from the other stages at the decks or by the hardware.

trout sez:
> X0X projects sunrise live pa was tits.

> nick s: give me the sickest acid line you have
> jesse: why?
> nick s: because the suns fucking coming up

someone has to remind the people who passed out drunk that the sun is coming
up...why not do it with the 303 :) i think sunrise is one of the best
timeslots for an outdoor party...2 1/2 hours of acceeeid is a great start to
your sunday....its always fun to setup a decent sized sound system and pound
the 808 and 303 at sunrise...on the downside...my mpc crashed out hard...i
havent checked it since i got back to cleveland(way too tired to deal with
it)...im hoping my new toy isnt fried...it would be just my luck that i have
the thing for less then 2weeks and it gets fried at the first gig i use it
at. :(

other highlights:
sherry's storming acid set....listening to that gave me so many good drum
programming ideas for the sunrise live pa.

evasion and mike c's extended tag set...those guys held it down for like
4hours...tough work when your drunk as fuck....but the train stayed on the
tracks...those 2 are definately 2 of clevelands finest.

thumptek playing with us for 45 mins...its cool to jam with new people...the
electribe was no match for the 808(even after i turned off the -30db pad on
the electribes channel)...i would definately be down to work with thumptek
again.

seeing the varied states of confusion about 10am was also pretty
cool...something about raving out in the wilderness makes people get extra
loose.

other than the mpc issue, i had a really great time...this party was
everything that the party at the ledges was supposed to be...it was also
nice to have a pb-cle outdoor party that was dry!

Yeah, trout mentioned he saw someone eating the grass over at the  
jungle stage :)  They should have got something together that every  
stage at the same time started to play some weird mind f*ck song at a  
low volume, like the "it's in my head" or that laughing song and  
watch all the people freak out. :)

Was kinda worried about the weather when they said it was going to  
rain sunday, but it held up and it was beautiful the whole time.   
Gotta love the night sky when you're in the middle of nowhere and no  
city lights to drown out the sky.

generator problems everywhere.  and that stinks because i could have easily
borrowed the o.g. west end bridge generator from kenny b.  the d&b stage
where i played (eh?) was run off of something looking like a miniature lawn
mower - teeny tiny.

all true to the rave spirit ... i'm so glad i went (even though a good 2.5
hour drive ;p)

we got a 5kw from home depot, maybe only a 10hp honda motor...nothing
special...but it did the job...the generator cost less to rent then the
distro i had to build tho! next time i think we're gonna have to get
something a little bigger...possibly upwards of 8kw...brown outs are a
bitch.

it wouldve been nice to have a generator with a 200hp detroit diesel in it,
but that wouldve been a bit over kill.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} EGL 3

Maybe get a battery back up or two to handle occasional brown outs,  
depending on how occasional they are/the size of the battery  
backups.  Wonder how much a car battery can one, Heard it can keep a  
computer running for a day or so I think :)

Usually car batteries will last 5+ hours if somethings draining it.

This surpirses me.  I own an MPC2000 and I've crashed it twice in 5 years.  Its never crashed during a show, and its send the cleanest midi-clock of any of the hardware I've used.
 
The only time I've crashed it is when I'm loading a new .APS file and playing with the pad sounds while its loading.
 
A downside of the MPC is that if you lose power you have to reload the interface with sounds, programs, and midi sequence files...which takes a lot of time you don't have during a live performance.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

DJ MOOSE with his break neck Breaks will be throwing down his most 
serious Breaks this Friday. Dark Knights has never shorted their crowd 
on the sound of the night, so in preperation for this night Moose will 
be bringing nothing but his fire power of dirty, tear the dance floor 
up, records.
Then DJ ONI ONE with his Drum-n-Bass that demands attention. Will be 
bringing the crowd what they are thirsty for in the Soulful, yet 
sometimes Dark, selection of quality records that few in the Cleveland 
area can match.
Dark Knights looks forward to seeing everyone this Friday and, since you 
never know what we will be endorsing from week to week, just stay 
posted.
See you Friday

There will always be NO COVER unless you are 18 to 21 and then it will

Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher // metalheadz, swerve, intasound

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
Energy FM. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MCs, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldies club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CDs for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to
recognition and respect.

Plush @ Mynt Presents - John Kelley 8-26-05

26 August 2005

John Kelley - Moonshine, Ball of Wax, www.djjohnkelley.com - California

In 1993, John Kelley began DJing at California's full moon desert
gatherings. Fusing the instrumental sounds of house, techno and 
breakbeat into a hard, tribal, psychedelic style that won him fans and 
critical raves throughout the 1990s, Kelley also displayed his skills to 
a national audience through a host of successful DJ mix albums, 
including the Funky Desert Breaks series and the High Desert Soundsystem 
series. In the late '90s Kelley traveled all over North America and 
toured with Orbital and The Crystal Method as the official DJ of 1999's 
Community Service Tour. With more critically acclaimed mix CDs, 
including his United DJs of America entry, Kelley began touring 
internationally in 2000, hitting Central America, Japan, Southeast Asia 
and Australia.

The beginning of a new decade also brought Kelley's first music 
productions, including El Mirage's "Tribal Divide," a Simply Jeff 
colaboration with "Jello Jigglin'" and the bittersweet gem "Rapture At 
Sea" with Eastern Sun. Famous for his eclectic tastes, generous spirit 
and natural ability to rock a dance floor, DJ John Kelley learned his 
love for techno and house music in the heyday of the LA rave underground 
of the early '90s. Attending legendary warehouse parties like 
Aphrodite's Temple of Love and religiously following DJ Doc Martin week 
after week to the seminal Flammable Liquid, Kelley inherited the 
cultural spirit of the underground while being inspired by the ethos of 
some of the world's best underground DJs. Within three years, Kelley's 
underground reputationleadto a higher profile, a relationship with 
Moonshine Music bringing snapshots of his music journeys to an eager and 
growing following. In 1996, Kelley debuted with "Funky Desert Breaks,"
now an underground cult classic that showcased his skills and sound to a
wider, unsuspecting audience. In 1997, "Funky Desert Breaks 2" charted a 
more progressive direction, but easily connected with the growing North
American rave scene. A transition in Kelley's sound began with 1998's
refreshing "Knee Deep," a less serious and more club-friendly mix of 
house, techno, trance and breakbeat. With 1999's "High Desert 
Soundsystem" and 2000's "High Desert Soundsystem 2," Kelley retained his 
desert roots while displaying a growing taste for global trends, 
compressed together in exciting and vibrant combinations.
United DJs of America 19" followed in 2001 to critical acclaim, and was
nominated at 2002's Winter Music Conference as one of the best DJ mix 
albums of 2001.

In 2002, after a busy schedule touring internationally, Kelley
began to focus on writing his own music. Scaling back his DJ 
engagements, he also started the Ball of Waxx music production company 
with his friend David de Laski, LA's Lord Runningclam. Collaborating 
with de Laski, Simply Jeff, Moontribe's DJ Brian Gollub, and LA producer 
Brian Saitzyk, Kelley pushed out a growing catalog of vital productions, 
including the brooding beauty, "Rapture at Sea." In 2004, while Kelley 
advanced his production chops, he made a more visible return to the 
DJcircuit in anticipation of techno's current revival.

Elysium - Inner Child and Groove Shop Records

Respected for his enduring role in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland rave scene, 
Brad Thomas, aka Dj Elysium has, in the past eight years, garnered a 
reputation as one of the finest house DJs in the tri-state area.

It wasn.t long into Brad.s DJing career, that promoters, both national 
and local, were interested in placing Brad along sides the likes of acts 
like; Carl Cox, Bad Boy Bill, and Charles Feelgood. Over the years, 
Brad.s sound evolved to include many forms of house including: funky, 
disco, speed garage, 2-step, vocal, jazzy, hard UK, and booty. His 
musical influences include Titonton Duvante, Feelgood, Bad boy Bill, 
Eric Morillo, MJ Cole, and DJ Sneak.

In recent years, Brad has continued to maintain his busy schedule of 
performing including: multiple long-term club residencies, special 
events and numerous raves.

Elysium has always been ahead of the game, as a performer and artist. 
After moving to Pittsburgh in the summer of 2002, Thomas shifted his 
musical focus to production. Although he still maintains a rigorous 
performing schedule, Thomas can also be found working hard in the studio 
with production partner DJ 7up. The two have collaborated on numerous 
releases for Jes One.s Groove Shop records of Chicago, as well as 
projects with Patrick Norman of Rusted Root.

a night of innovative techno, from minimal to stomping, and possibly 
even some drum and bass thrown in for good measure (she played some live 
at Fuse:in).

Leila *mystery last name* Tallmadge/Akron
Classic Dave - Toledo/Bowling Green
Dan Naughton- Youngstown/ Bowling Green
Chuck Milke Bowling Green/ Pittsburgh
Erica M.(with very French sounding last name) Cincy/Bowling Green/Pittsburgh

Subject: {pb-cle} Yes I'm moving again


Ok so here's the low down for you nerds..

I got stuck in a situation where I was talked back into moving home for  
obvious reasons concerning my family and my
fucking retard ex. Since I've been back, I've done nothing but let these  
guys walk all over me, and now it's time for me
to stand.Most of you know me, and know how much I hate this state, and  
moving back here has caused me nothing but
depression and troubles because of my family.

I think Interpol said it best for me ::  I'm sick of spending these lonely  
nights training myself not to care.

I've just decided tonight at 12am, that I'm going to be moving back to  
Pittsburgh, unless something amazing happens in my
life within the next 3 months (which isn't my luck anyways but it sure  
seems like somethings floating and I think about
you alot still!) then this is where I'll be going. I was going to hit my  
way towards NYC, but I'll be putting that in the
bank while I'm in Pittsburgh..

I don't know how long it's going to take, and I don't know when and what  
part of the city I'll be moving to as of yet. I'm
still on the look out for something I fit best. I would stick around here,  
but at this time I can't stand to be around my
family for they have betrayed me as a family member and I'm pretty much  
done with their shit. I've taken the abuse since I
was a young child, and it's time I walk away from it. I don't ever expect  
to treat my family this way if I ever have one,
because everyone needs love in their lives and it's something that I'm  
lacking in a huge way. What's the point of being
around something, or someone that's going to constantly put you down as a  
human? I don't ever want to come back to this
town again unless it's to see my friends only... And I mean it by heart.

This email hurts me the most, because there's ALOT of you here that helped  
me along my path, and everytime I leave this
place, YOU are the ones I miss the most. (and I cant believe I'm crying  
tears trying to write this)..
Forte, Paul, everyone at Poo Bas, Chris R, Dom, Kevin Cunningham and the  
guys at Spy, Brent, all the 412DNB guys, the
entire PB-CLE, Sherry, Nick S, Mike Danko, Steph and Linds, Kas, Bac, the  
entire Crystal Clear group, there's just so many
of you that've touched me and I can't express how much you mean to me. I  
know I'm missing so many of you, and that's why
I'm here writing this..  please don't feel left out....

I'm sorry if I disappointed anyone here in Cleveland, and it wasn't my  
purpose at all. Like I said, I had fun while I was
here, got to meet yet more intelligent humans which is hard to come by.  
Yes Chris R. I'm talking about you. Even though I
lost my best friend over some stupid four letter word that starts with an  
L. Please let him know he's in my thoughts and
prayers, and I miss him as my best FRIEND.

My emails, aim's, and cell number will always be the same. I won't be  
unsubbing from the list. Please feel free to contact
me for any reason. I always have time and heart for you!!...I know I have  
alot of things coming up I'm playing for, which
I will not cancel unless I've contacted you MYSELF. I will be at the  
Bailey event, trying to shed smiles on everyone!

I want to thank everyone that supported my coming back home. All you guys  
are swell in my book, and I'd drop everything in
my life to help you guys if needed.I will contact everyone again to  
atleast let you know when, what, and where I'm going.
I'll be making my rounds when the time comes to leave, and making sure I  
atleast get hugs out of each and everyone one of
you...

entire PB-CLE, Sherry, Nick S, Mike Danko, Steph and Linds, Kas, Bac, the  
entire Crystal Clear group, there's just so many
of you that've touched me and I can't express how much you mean to me. I  
know I'm missing so many of you, and that's why
I'm here writing this..  please don't feel left out....

I'm sorry if I disappointed anyone here in Cleveland, and it wasn't my  
purpose at all. Like I said, I had fun while I was
here, got to meet yet more intelligent humans which is hard to come by.  
Yes Chris R. I'm talking about you. Even though I
lost my best friend over some stupid four letter word that starts with an  
L. Please let him know he's in my thoughts and
prayers, and I miss him as my best FRIEND.

My emails, aim's, and cell number will always be the same. I won't be  
unsubbing from the list. Please feel free to contact
me for any reason. I always have time and heart for you!!...I know I have  
alot of things coming up I'm playing for, which
I will not cancel unless I've contacted you MYSELF. I will be at the  
Bailey event, trying to shed smiles on everyone!

I want to thank everyone that supported my coming back home. All you guys  
are swell in my book, and I'd drop everything in
my life to help you guys if needed.I will contact everyone again to  
atleast let you know when, what, and where I'm going.
I'll be making my rounds when the time comes to leave, and making sure I  
atleast get hugs out of each and everyone one of
you...

Pittsburgh is dope.

Only the Strong survive. 
the rest die in the suburban wasteland.

If only one thing troubles me about Pittburgh, its the
lack of a Black upper middle class, or a Black upper
class. Many other cities, like Atlanta,Detroit and
Charlotte have 'em. (kinda gives me hope, ya' know?) 

But as always, it has been said, that Pittsburgh is a
place to settle and develop things...then take it on
the road. 

if things dont turn around, or make that move to turn
around, see you all in Truth or Consequences, New
Mexico.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Yes I'm moving again

it's just plain numbers.  by the end of 2005 our population will
have decreased almost 25% from 1980.  allegheny county has the 3rd
highest number of people over age 65.  #1 #2 #4 are all florida counties.
and the old folks here are poor to boot.

pittsburgh could be dope.  but i just felt it this year like i couldn't
believe.  drive down carson street - half the store fronts are empty.
when i was looking for a place for milk 5 years ago there were maybe 4
open spots.  teleropa is gone..then the smaller version around the corner
closes this summer - that's nuts in a college town.  who knows what
oakland is in for - but if the areas of town that used to thrive and have
personality with cool little shops are going to shit, what the fuck is
left ?  new balance shoes and the waterfront ?  from a promoters
standpoint, those areas were key to promotion.  you're *hard* pressed to
generate new people to come to quality music events when there aren't
gathering spots where you can find them.

believe me..i've held out as long as i possibly could.  i'm out spring
06.

this one!

the pause was super brief.

Props to everyone involved!

I had a good time, most of all because of all the
great people that were there, and because it seemed
everyone was just out to have a good time.  As always
much love to the goaheads, it was so nice to see you
all!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Yes I'm moving again

I spent a long, long fucking while looking for a job.

Couldn't find one.  Left.

If you look at the census data, there's maybe like 50,000 people in
Pittsburgh who have bachelor's degrees.  The colleges graduate 10,000
people a year with new bachelor's degrees.  So if you get a degree,
want to use it, and want to stay, it's just a bitch to find a job,
because soooo many people have the same education you do, and are
vying for a very small number of spots.

I spent most of my time looking for tech work in Pittsburgh.  I live
in DC now.  There are jobs here like whoa, although that's probably
mostly thanks to the Bush administration, love 'em or hate 'em.

Where you headed in '06, Kelly?

This was a lot like the woody mcbride night, or Luke's previous  
party.  The (few) people that were there had a blast, but where the  
hell was everyone? at bad boy bill?  This just annoys the hell out of  
me; there are people throwing excellent parties but no one goes to  
them.  I guess at least those few people that do go to these are at  
least going there to have a good time and not being shady, at least  
most of them anyway.  But I know there are a lot more people out  
there than what showed up.  It's just so annoying seeing promoters  
lose so much money because... um... I guess cleveland just sucks.

With all that out of the way.  Memorable sets were Analog Pussy,  
Trout Soup, and the boompsie/meghan tag team.  Although everyone did  
a great job.  Also thanks to marissa and all the work she put into  
decorating the place.

I'll get the pictures up either today or tomorrow.
