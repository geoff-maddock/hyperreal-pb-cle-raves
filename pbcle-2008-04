Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} Experimedia News : 2 New Releases & Other News

Two new releases freely available at http://experimedia.net by Paul
Mahoux in MP3 or FLAC formats.  Coming next...a fantastic release from
Koen Park.  Also expect to see some fantastic limited edition cd
releases in  fantastic custom designed signature packaging.
Everything designed, manufactured, and managed by our own hands.
BTW...we are currently excepting demos for cd and net releases.  Also
check out our own upcoming releases on various labels as well as info
regarding our various upcoming performances. Info at
http://jbjh.experimedia.net

Enjoy the new releases...
Best Wishes to all,
Jeremy Bible & Jason Henry

exp045 - paul mahoux - ten roleplays
"ten roleplays" is a pretext to release unassorted tracks that i
accumulated over the years 2000-2007 and that never fitted into an
album, for lack of stylistic unity. ranging from ambient looped guitar
improvisations (tracks 2, 10) to more standard electronica (tracks 1,
3, 7) or even house (track 9), their only common link is that they
almost all contain my guitar playing and some field recordings i made,
sometimes heavily processed and unrecognizable. those ten tracks are
like ten roleplays, with me ending up in several styles in a
schizophrenic way, always oscillating between my love of guitar and my
love of computer.

exp044 - paul mahoux - colour beads session
sixty six minutes of non stop dubby and progressive house music, more
based on my guitar than synthesizers. not your dancefloor killer here
(though sometimes...), but a good alternance of house with some more
atmospheric moments. this is my laptop computer live set from 2005,
which i slightly edited to smoothen up some imperfections from when it
was performed at club mnd in naha, okinawa. a good idea of what you
can do with this wonderful software, ableton live. only eight tracks
of audio clips looping together and driven with a midi controller. of
course, my guitar is everywhere, many elements appear more than once,
and some even ended up into other tracks i made for the album above.
it says it in the title, the big fun was to play with all sorts of
audio clips, almost all home made, and to put them in rows and series,
like you would do with beads, reusing this element here for that part
there, self quoting myself, and also borrowing two samples: one from
the beegees, "staying
alive', and one from hassan hakmoum, "the gift of the gnawas". if you
download it, just make sure that you burn your cd with no gaps between
part1 and part2, and it will flow smoothly for one hour and six
minutes.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Apr 04              GHETTO SPAGHETTI ALL GROWN UP             Cleveland

So. I will be having my half-way-to-60 birthday party on Friday, 4 april 
2008...

who:

John Johr: paxahau, DETROIT
he is honestly the most polite bad-ass detroit dj I have ever met....

John Johr started Dj.ing in 1999, drawing influence from the early 
Detroit Techno and House sound. John.s sets maintain an artistic balance 
that blend a fusion of acid house, minimal and Detroit techno, a quality 
directly shaped by his occupation as record purchaser for Detroit.s 
famed Record Time. His status propelled through producing Input/Output, 
one of Detroit.s longest running weekly events and host to both new and 
veteran international talents such as Blake Baxter, Dan Bell, John 
Tejada and Ryan Crosson.

John also took up residency with Paxahau, becoming one of a select few 
DJ.s to represent the promotional powerhouse behind the decks. As a 
three year resident of Paxahau, John.s DJ career has further mobilized 
to include large Midwest events such as The Detroit Electronic Music 
Festival and opening for headlining acts: Steve Bug, Marco Carola, 
Luciano, Loco Dice, Marc Houle and Richie Hawtin. John continues to 
stand out among Detroit DJs using creative skills and years of 
experience as resources to provide an unequalled mixing display.



Random(seed): TEK-KNOW?-
Randomseed has been dropping tunes on a pair of turntables for over 12 
years now. No stranger to the future sound of music this versatile DJ 
has played events from Pittsburgh to San Fransisco, Cleveland to New 
Orleans and damn near everywhere in between. Starting as a house DJ in 
the mid 90's Randomseed finally found his calling in the evolving sound 
of techno circa 2001. The founding member of the Tek-Know collective and 
with an eye for talent he has successfully rounded up the best techno 
talent in Ohio and beyond under the Tek-Know banner influencing the 
tastes of techno lovers everywhere. In 2006 he finally put his taste to 
the test moving into the production realm with several underground 
releases currently circulating in digital format and with plans of 
launching Tek-Know as a record and netlabel in late 2007 there are only 
bigger and bigger things in the future for this prolific artist and the 
Tek-Know group as a whole. Having devoted his life to the audio art 
forms his passion is unrivaled and inspired. Switching between DJ sets 
and Live Pa's and even sometimes doing both at once you never know what 
to expect from his performances except the best techno beats available. 
He is also a contributing writer for Bassline Magazine


1-Auxy: TEK-KNOW?-
WOW. i was going to steal his bio from tekknow.experimedia.net alas.. it 
is a five page story that will not fit on this page..
all i know is i have known him since the 10th grade and i have watched 
him grow from a very bad knob twiddler on his pontiac grand am, into a 
very bad-ass dj.. it's been 14 years since i started listening to him 
and it just keeps getting better...

Fri Apr 11                       TRAFFIK JAM                     Pittsburgh

We are proud to announce Traffick Jam, a benefit event for the Project 
to End Human Trafficking, a local non-profit organization based out of 
Carlow University. Their website can be found here:
http://www.endhumantrafficking.org
There is also ample information available from other websites and from 
me [Jaime Turek] if anyone would like more information on the cause 
[punkisphun@gmail.com].

When: Friday April 11th
Time: 9pm-2am
Cost: $10 minimum donation
Where: Anthony's
           950 Ohio River Blvd
           Pittsburgh, PA 15202
Who: 21+

Now really, WHO:

DJ Meghan (Goahead/Psylicious/Xcience) vs. Eryn Evans (Sinister 
Movement, Phoenix Management, B.A.D. ASS) [Psytrance tag team]

DJ 7UP (Steel City Funk) w/ live percussion by percussionist/DJ Anthony 
Fugate [House]

Matt Monroe vs. Paul Alexander (Humanaut) [Tech House/Techno]

Jason Cuban (Full House Productions) vs. Brandon Andrews (Cool House 
Collective) [Tech House/Techno]

Sean Kramer (B.A.D. Ass) [Progressive]

DJ Kip Collins (AMPM) [Progressive]

Sound and Lights by BigB

Some people suggested that I give some information about what I do so 
here I go. I go to grad school for international development and my 
major is human security. I focus on human trafficking and plan to pursue 
a career in that field once I graduate. I am currently volunteering for 
this organization and will be interning with them over the summer. They 
have a very small staff but are trying to expand. I have planned this 
event with the help of my boyfriend and 100% of the ticket sales go 
directly to the organization. Myself and the DJs are doing this soley to 
raise money for this cause. Now some info on human trafficking:

The trafficking of human beings is the recruitment, transportation, 
harbouring, or receipt of people for the purpose of exploitation. It is 
estimated to be a $5 to $9 billion-a-year industry. Trafficking victims 
typically are recruited using coercion, deception, fraud, the abuse of 
power, or outright abduction. Threats, violence, and economic leverage 
can often make a victim consent to exploitation.

Exploitation includes forcing people into prostitution or other forms of 
sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices 
similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. For children, 
exploitation may also include forced prostitution, illicit international 
adoption, trafficking for early marriage, or recruitment as child 
soldiers, beggars, or for religious cults.

I'd be more than happy to supply anyone with more information upon 
request. I don't want to write a book on here.

Sat Apr 12                         412 TAG                       Pittsburgh

Get ready to represent Pittsburgh as our locals battle it out 
in this tag team dual to the death. Well, maybe not death, but at least 
until the end of their set!

Cutups vs. Keeb$ (412DnB, Randomness)

Chico vs. Reson8 (Subsurface/Focused Motives, Electro Breaks/Technufunk)

Rukkus vs. Tika (Steel City Hardcore, Hardcore)

and introducing

The Assassins (1337, DnB Mashups)

Since we do anticipate a great turnout for this event, on top of a great 
evening, we've decided to give something back to the community.

When you arrive at 412 Tag we will be taking monetary donations for 
Animal Protectors, which is a non-profit animal shelter in New 
Kensington, PA.

Animal Protectors are a no-kill, non-profit shelter located in New 
Kensington, PA. Their shelter is always full of animals, many which are 
strays. Their shelter is a constant stream of activity. New animals are 
examined for possible problems, medical charts are checked and 
medication is administered, when needed. Cat cages and dog kennels are 
cleaned daily. From the time the shelter opens until it closes, there's 
a constant flurry of cleaning, feeding, exercising, cuddling, caring. 
Fresh food, water, litter boxes, and blankets are placed in each cage 
daily.

This event is being held at the Braddock Elks Lodge, 424 Library Road, 
Braddock, PA. This is a prime location, only about 15 or 20 minutes from 
downtown.

The venue features a stocked bar with drink specials, a kitchen that 
will cook food as late as you can eat it, and has its own parking lot 
around back to save you the hassle of parking.

The Braddock Police Department will be providing an off-duty officer to 
ensure everyone has a safe, drama-free time.

Sat Apr 12                       BASSNECTAR                      Pittsburgh

Saturday 04/12, Bassnectar with special guest Eliot Lipp
Pittsburgh, PA: Mr. Smalls Funhouse

A freeform project that merges music, art, new media, social 
involvement, and community values; dedicated to a constantly-evolving 
ethos of collaborative creation, self-reinvention, and boundary-pushing 
experimentation. While existing as a mutating collaborative effort, 
Bassnectar is traditionally the amorphous music project of Lorin Ashton, 
a San Francisco based Musician / Producer / DJ, (.probably the largest 
cult following of any DJ in San Francisco. . SF Weekly) highlighted by 
massive basslines, thick mob scene beats, freakshow energy, emotive 
melodics, traditional acoustic instrumentation, and fearless mashing of 
genres, styles, sounds, moods, and approaches. Fusing elements of 
midtempo breakbeats, big beat, old school hip hop and dub, DnB, glitch, 
IDM, electronica, death metal, grindcore, punk rock, alternative, folk, 
swing, and jazz; and sampling anything from the human history of sound 
and music, Bassnectar might be most accurately described as .omni-tempo 
maximalism.

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Ewun
(Lifted Music, Human Imprint, Evol Intent) - Rochester, NY

Ewun tha Gun delivers tracks that sound like a robot with Turrets 
syndrome on a very serious mission.ù A hint of early 90s ragga-styled 
breakbeat hardcore percolates deep underneath the crust of industrial 
twisted metal mayhem and hardcore hip-hops sibilant cadence. Ewun's 
transatlantic influences have appropriately led to partnerships with 
UK-based labels Barcode Recordings and Lifted Music UK, as well as 
Dieselboy's Human Imprint. The upcoming year promises to reveal several 
tracks of grimey jungalist haze and aggressively smelt percussion. His 
latest tour entitled the Levitation tour is smashing across the U.S. 
sponsored by Lifted Music.

Nino Anthony,(portamento)-Columbus,OH

Nino Anthony, dj/producer and co-label owner of Portamento Records has

formed label at the time, Portamento Records. His first single .Dance 
All Night. was remixed by Italy.s respected producer, Alex Kenji and was 
charted by several dj.s including Donald Glaude. Shortly after, his 
remix of David Farlow.s .How I Roll. was charted and supported by Sucker 
Dj.s. Since then Nino has released a whole slew of releases and remixes 
on some of the biggest labels in the world in including Subliminal, 
Juicy Traxx, Pacha Recordings, Eden Recordings, Play Digital, Movement 
Music, Curvve, BugEyed Records, New Era, Cubic, Wagram & Vendetta among

Sat May 31                          SNUFF                        Cincinatti

Burufunk

With over 40 commercial releases on more than 30 labels, his success can 
be measured by his achievements. Burufunk.s debut single, .Freedom,. 
released by Kloud 9 Music and featured on the 1998 Streetbeat 
compilation, Battle on Funky Planet, made the track a hit and propelled 
the artist onto the international stage. As a respected producer and 
pioneer of the breakbeat era, Burufunk kept the ball rolling with 
several other hit singles, including the 2000 release of, .The Dream 
Experience,. on Napzzz and his now infamous, .Outsider,. which was 
featured by Nick Warren on the 2003 Global Underground compilation, 
#024: Reykjavik. After some well deserved international notoriety, many 
more opportunities presented themselves, including one that led to the 
hit Burufunk remix of BT.s, .Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist).. 
Renowned artist and producer, BT .was absolutely knocked sideways!., by 
the brilliantly crafted Burufunk remix, as was the entire dance music 
industry. Knowing it was important to work with other artists and 
performers, Burufunk forged a lifelong relationship with artists like 
Deepsky, DJ Icey, and many more.

Over time, Burufunk managed to perfect his art and build a live 
performance as energetic and creative as the sounds he brings with him. 
>From his .on the fly. sound manipulation, to his custom crafted remixes, 
Burufunk seamlessly crafts his exclusive sets right from the minds of 
his audience. Burufunk has opened for some of the biggest names in the 
industry on the most extravagant stages in the world, including the 
Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference in Miami. It was his 
2006 performance with Carbon Community in Miami, that kicked off their 
Community Funk Tour, and brought his future intentions front and center.

After several years of effective work in the industry, Burufunk teamed 
up with long-time friend and colleague, Brett Holland to help build the 
new Orlando-based indie label Shiznit Recordings, home of the hottest 
cutting edge EDM. Watch for upcoming shows and releases from Burufunk in 
2007, including the monster progressive house single .Serenity,. 
featuring vocals by 3PM, slated for a spring 2007 release on Undermine 
Records.

DJ Lea Luna

At the young age of 24, ear and eye-catching DJ Lea Luna has quite a 
handle on the club scene. She is a lifelong musician: playing keys for 
as far back as she can remember, and spinning records since she wasn't 
even of age to get into the clubs (in the underground rave heydey, 
1999). When a 16 year old girl begins sharpening mixing skills and 
stacking up an arsenal of records and CDs that soon in her life, what 
potential does she already have in the club industry when she turns 21? 
DJ Lea Luna will tell you. She's already played all over the country at 
some of the most prestigious clubs and events the commercial electronic 
scene has. Her remix sets and her 6-foot-blonde stage prowess handed her 
the rockstar nickname "bootlegs." Her crowd-shaking mix of big-room 
club, house, progressive, rock, and retro landed her in the DJ booths of 
clubs such as Avalon New York and B.E.D. Miami. Not only clubs took 
notice. She even rocked the stage with Ultra music fest favorite Kevens, 
as part of his show, and opened for music legends Steven Tyler and Chuck 
Berry. "After these past couple of years, I feel like I've reached a 
level in my artistry that measures up with the best, and I'm ready to 
own it. I recently added my first name to my former DJ name, DJ Luna. To 
me, the name Lea Luna symbolizes the final touch. I've completely 
embodied the artist I've always dreamed of being. I've become the real 
ME." ...and that she has.

Describing Lea's upcoming new release - LUNANIMOUS is one voice, one 
massive. The massive is speaking one
universal language; at every rock show, night club, house party,
through every radio station, in every ipod. Lea Luna's LUNANIMOUS is
a new dialect of the rock-tronica tongue that both the underground
and overground massives can fluently express.

"I started early, I traveled, I learned, I met people... I went through 
all kinds of music training, audio school, and this whole DJ thing 
forever. Now, I've pinpointed my love for this scene, the music, the 
lyric, my life in general, and art in general. I've defined my 
strengths, my own unique style, my inspiration, and my goals to a T. It 
all leads up to this: basically, I've lived my whole life to make this 
new music ROCK and take it to the stage."

DJ B N@$TY

B N@$TY has been making a name for himself all across the country this 
past year. After opening for Lea Luna in Reno, NV in December, they 
decided to team up again for Snuff. With his mind on the scene and the 
scene on his music, B N@$TY is laying down that Speed Garage Sound in a 
city near you. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Dave Digital vs Straight Vizual

Thats right kids, your two favorite Drum-N-Breaks DJ's are going to be 
tearing it up at the gym club. Whether its turntablism, perfect mixing, 
or just sick ass tracks, Dave Digital and Josh Vizual are 2 of the 
Tri-State's favorite tag sets. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who

course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Some people suggested that I give some information about what I do so 
here I go. I go to grad school for international development and my 
major is human security. I focus on human trafficking and plan to pursue 
a career in that field once I graduate. I am currently volunteering for 
this organization and will be interning with them over the summer. They 
have a very small staff but are trying to expand. I have planned this 
event with the help of my boyfriend and 100% of the ticket sales go 
directly to the organization. Myself and the DJs are doing this soley to 
raise money for this cause. Now some info on human trafficking:

The trafficking of human beings is the recruitment, transportation, 
harbouring, or receipt of people for the purpose of exploitation. It is 
estimated to be a $5 to $9 billion-a-year industry. Trafficking victims 
typically are recruited using coercion, deception, fraud, the abuse of 
power, or outright abduction. Threats, violence, and economic leverage 
can often make a victim consent to exploitation.

Exploitation includes forcing people into prostitution or other forms of 
sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices 
similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. For children, 
exploitation may also include forced prostitution, illicit international 
adoption, trafficking for early marriage, or recruitment as child 
soldiers, beggars, or for religious cults.

I'd be more than happy to supply anyone with more information upon 
request. I don't want to write a book on here.

Sat Apr 12                         412 TAG                       Pittsburgh

Get ready to represent Pittsburgh as our locals battle it out 
in this tag team dual to the death. Well, maybe not death, but at least 
until the end of their set!

Cutups vs. Keeb$ (412DnB, Randomness)

Chico vs. Reson8 (Subsurface/Focused Motives, Electro Breaks/Technufunk)

Rukkus vs. Tika (Steel City Hardcore, Hardcore)

and introducing

The Assassins (1337, DnB Mashups)

Since we do anticipate a great turnout for this event, on top of a great 
evening, we've decided to give something back to the community.

When you arrive at 412 Tag we will be taking monetary donations for 
Animal Protectors, which is a non-profit animal shelter in New 
Kensington, PA.

Animal Protectors are a no-kill, non-profit shelter located in New 
Kensington, PA. Their shelter is always full of animals, many which are 
strays. Their shelter is a constant stream of activity. New animals are 
examined for possible problems, medical charts are checked and 
medication is administered, when needed. Cat cages and dog kennels are 
cleaned daily. From the time the shelter opens until it closes, there's 
a constant flurry of cleaning, feeding, exercising, cuddling, caring. 
Fresh food, water, litter boxes, and blankets are placed in each cage 
daily.

This event is being held at the Braddock Elks Lodge, 424 Library Road, 
Braddock, PA. This is a prime location, only about 15 or 20 minutes from 
downtown.

The venue features a stocked bar with drink specials, a kitchen that 
will cook food as late as you can eat it, and has its own parking lot 
around back to save you the hassle of parking.

The Braddock Police Department will be providing an off-duty officer to 
ensure everyone has a safe, drama-free time.

Sat Apr 12                       BASSNECTAR                      Pittsburgh

Saturday 04/12, Bassnectar with special guest Eliot Lipp
Pittsburgh, PA: Mr. Smalls Funhouse

A freeform project that merges music, art, new media, social 
involvement, and community values; dedicated to a constantly-evolving 
ethos of collaborative creation, self-reinvention, and boundary-pushing 
experimentation. While existing as a mutating collaborative effort, 
Bassnectar is traditionally the amorphous music project of Lorin Ashton, 
a San Francisco based Musician / Producer / DJ, (.probably the largest 
cult following of any DJ in San Francisco. . SF Weekly) highlighted by 
massive basslines, thick mob scene beats, freakshow energy, emotive 
melodics, traditional acoustic instrumentation, and fearless mashing of 
genres, styles, sounds, moods, and approaches. Fusing elements of 
midtempo breakbeats, big beat, old school hip hop and dub, DnB, glitch, 
IDM, electronica, death metal, grindcore, punk rock, alternative, folk, 
swing, and jazz; and sampling anything from the human history of sound 
and music, Bassnectar might be most accurately described as .omni-tempo 
maximalism.

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

[a bit of a drive, but something rare]

Kraftwerk are doing four shows in the United States in April, two of 
them within (somewhat) reasonable distance of our area. I'm not sure if 
you have any interest in this (or them) whatsoever, but being that they 
are the supposed "godfathers of electronic music" and certainly aren't 
getting any younger, I decided to submit this anyway.

Ewun
(Lifted Music, Human Imprint, Evol Intent) - Rochester, NY

Ewun tha Gun delivers tracks that sound like a robot with Turrets 
syndrome on a very serious mission.ù A hint of early 90s ragga-styled 
breakbeat hardcore percolates deep underneath the crust of industrial 
twisted metal mayhem and hardcore hip-hops sibilant cadence. Ewun's 
transatlantic influences have appropriately led to partnerships with 
UK-based labels Barcode Recordings and Lifted Music UK, as well as 
Dieselboy's Human Imprint. The upcoming year promises to reveal several 
tracks of grimey jungalist haze and aggressively smelt percussion. His 
latest tour entitled the Levitation tour is smashing across the U.S. 
sponsored by Lifted Music.

Nino Anthony,(portamento)-Columbus,OH

Nino Anthony, dj/producer and co-label owner of Portamento Records has 
always had a love and passion for music of all genres. He first made a 
name for himself in 2006 as a producer by releasing tracks on his newly 
formed label at the time, Portamento Records. His first single .Dance 
All Night. was remixed by Italy.s respected producer, Alex Kenji and was 
charted by several dj.s including Donald Glaude. Shortly after, his 
remix of David Farlow.s .How I Roll. was charted and supported by Sucker 
Dj.s. Since then Nino has released a whole slew of releases and remixes 
on some of the biggest labels in the world in including Subliminal, 
Juicy Traxx, Pacha Recordings, Eden Recordings, Play Digital, Movement

Sat May 31                          SNUFF                        Cincinatti

Burufunk

With over 40 commercial releases on more than 30 labels, his success can 
be measured by his achievements. Burufunk.s debut single, .Freedom,. 
released by Kloud 9 Music and featured on the 1998 Streetbeat 
compilation, Battle on Funky Planet, made the track a hit and propelled 
the artist onto the international stage. As a respected producer and 
pioneer of the breakbeat era, Burufunk kept the ball rolling with 
several other hit singles, including the 2000 release of, .The Dream 
Experience,. on Napzzz and his now infamous, .Outsider,. which was 
featured by Nick Warren on the 2003 Global Underground compilation, 
#024: Reykjavik. After some well deserved international notoriety, many 
more opportunities presented themselves, including one that led to the 
hit Burufunk remix of BT.s, .Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist).. 
Renowned artist and producer, BT .was absolutely knocked sideways!., by 
the brilliantly crafted Burufunk remix, as was the entire dance music 
industry. Knowing it was important to work with other artists and 
performers, Burufunk forged a lifelong relationship with artists like 
Deepsky, DJ Icey, and many more.

Over time, Burufunk managed to perfect his art and build a live 
performance as energetic and creative as the sounds he brings with him. 
>From his .on the fly. sound manipulation, to his custom crafted remixes, 
Burufunk seamlessly crafts his exclusive sets right from the minds of 
his audience. Burufunk has opened for some of the biggest names in the 
industry on the most extravagant stages in the world, including the 
Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference in Miami. It was his 
2006 performance with Carbon Community in Miami, that kicked off their 
Community Funk Tour, and brought his future intentions front and center.

After several years of effective work in the industry, Burufunk teamed 
up with long-time friend and colleague, Brett Holland to help build the 
new Orlando-based indie label Shiznit Recordings, home of the hottest 
cutting edge EDM. Watch for upcoming shows and releases from Burufunk in 
2007, including the monster progressive house single .Serenity,. 
featuring vocals by 3PM, slated for a spring 2007 release on Undermine 
Records.

DJ Lea Luna

At the young age of 24, ear and eye-catching DJ Lea Luna has quite a 
handle on the club scene. She is a lifelong musician: playing keys for 
as far back as she can remember, and spinning records since she wasn't 
even of age to get into the clubs (in the underground rave heydey, 
1999). When a 16 year old girl begins sharpening mixing skills and 
stacking up an arsenal of records and CDs that soon in her life, what 
potential does she already have in the club industry when she turns 21? 
DJ Lea Luna will tell you. She's already played all over the country at 
some of the most prestigious clubs and events the commercial electronic 
scene has. Her remix sets and her 6-foot-blonde stage prowess handed her 
the rockstar nickname "bootlegs." Her crowd-shaking mix of big-room 
club, house, progressive, rock, and retro landed her in the DJ booths of 
clubs such as Avalon New York and B.E.D. Miami. Not only clubs took 
notice. She even rocked the stage with Ultra music fest favorite Kevens, 
as part of his show, and opened for music legends Steven Tyler and Chuck 
Berry. "After these past couple of years, I feel like I've reached a 
level in my artistry that measures up with the best, and I'm ready to 
own it. I recently added my first name to my former DJ name, DJ Luna. To 
me, the name Lea Luna symbolizes the final touch. I've completely 
embodied the artist I've always dreamed of being. I've become the real 
ME." ...and that she has.

Describing Lea's upcoming new release - LUNANIMOUS is one voice, one 
massive. The massive is speaking one
universal language; at every rock show, night club, house party,
through every radio station, in every ipod. Lea Luna's LUNANIMOUS is
a new dialect of the rock-tronica tongue that both the underground
and overground massives can fluently express.

"I started early, I traveled, I learned, I met people... I went through 
all kinds of music training, audio school, and this whole DJ thing 
forever. Now, I've pinpointed my love for this scene, the music, the 
lyric, my life in general, and art in general. I've defined my 
strengths, my own unique style, my inspiration, and my goals to a T. It 
all leads up to this: basically, I've lived my whole life to make this 
new music ROCK and take it to the stage."

DJ B N@$TY

B N@$TY has been making a name for himself all across the country this 
past year. After opening for Lea Luna in Reno, NV in December, they 
decided to team up again for Snuff. With his mind on the scene and the 
scene on his music, B N@$TY is laying down that Speed Garage Sound in a 
city near you. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Dave Digital vs Straight Vizual

Thats right kids, your two favorite Drum-N-Breaks DJ's are going to be 
tearing it up at the gym club. Whether its turntablism, perfect mixing, 
or just sick ass tracks, Dave Digital and Josh Vizual are 2 of the 
Tri-State's favorite tag sets. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Subject: {pb-cle} count zero and hypnotyza present universal serial beats vol. 1

it's been a while, but i've finally gotten my arse in gear and put
some new material together in conjunction with dj count zer0 (aka
frank glazer - currently operating out of new york city). we have
performed together a couple times, and have been close friends for
years, but this is the first joint project we've worked on for general
release to the public.

taking cues from our shared affinity for all things falling on the
soulful side of house and techno, we've assembled two mixes by two djs
with a common theme. it's not a tag team, but we had a lot of input on
each other's track selection (veto power ftw) and even contributed
unreleased music and edits for the other to work with. we had one
goal, a singular artistic statement: we want you to move to this.

for those who need a bit more description (if you can't guage your
interest from the tracklist below), these aren't "rave choons" by any
stretch of the imagination, but that doesn't mean you can't shake a
tailfeather to these mixes. these tracks draw on inspiration from
detroit techno, the roots of disco, and classic house flavors (303's
and 808's!!!) to build momentum for 2+ hours of pleasure.

special thanks go to Shawn Rudiman for contributing an unreleased
track to Frank's half of the mix.

Bushwacka hasn't produced an interesting tune in ages, I can say that at 
least.

Seriously, though, tell the dancefloor at Mr Smalls over the weekend 
that breaks are dead.

that was a sick show! good seeing you again dean. and i agree... bushwacka never really produced any great breaks tracks. they were all pretty minimal and boring. good tracks but not great. and they never went anywhere. maybe thats why he feels the way he does. dont lash out at the genre just because you failed to produce great music in it, bushcracka.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Veteran DJs Dismiss Breaks, Minimal & Maximal

Speaking of which, can I recommend to the list two west-coast breaks 
producers?

Kraddy's "Illegal Album" was a bunch of hip-hop remixed with a glitch 
breaks sound to it. Kanye's Golddigger and Lupe Fiasco's I Gotcha are 
both on there, and damn good tracks.

edIT as well; Certified Air Raid Material is the name of the album. Good 
times.

There are definitely some awesome tracks coming out, they just don't fit 
into "minimal breaks".

&gt; bushwacka never really produced any great breaks<br>

Subject: {pb-cle} Breaks Dead---MY ASS!

I don't usually chime in on many things, but the utter audacity of Bushwacka to claim "breaks are dead"  infuriates me!  Not only did this guy make his fame off the genre, he turned his back on his breadmaker.  Where I come from, that's called treason.  Add to the fact that Dubstep is sweeping the scene at a fever pace and you have to ask yourself what the fuck this guy is on!  LONG LIVE BREAKS...

i prefer as little bush as possible.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Apr 18                       CANDYBALL 4                            NYC

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

[a bit of a drive, but something rare]

Kraftwerk are doing four shows in the United States in April, two of 
them within (somewhat) reasonable distance of our area. I'm not sure if 
you have any interest in this (or them) whatsoever, but being that they 
are the supposed "godfathers of electronic music" and certainly aren't 
getting any younger, I decided to submit this anyway.

Sat May 03                    HEAVY ARTILLERY 2                       Akron

Ewun
(Lifted Music, Human Imprint, Evol Intent) - Rochester, NY

Ewun tha Gun delivers tracks that sound like a robot with Turrets 
syndrome on a very serious mission.ù A hint of early 90s ragga-styled 
breakbeat hardcore percolates deep underneath the crust of industrial 
twisted metal mayhem and hardcore hip-hops sibilant cadence. Ewun's 
transatlantic influences have appropriately led to partnerships with 
UK-based labels Barcode Recordings and Lifted Music UK, as well as 
Dieselboy's Human Imprint. The upcoming year promises to reveal several 
tracks of grimey jungalist haze and aggressively smelt percussion. His 
latest tour entitled the Levitation tour is smashing across the U.S. 
sponsored by Lifted Music.

Nino Anthony,(portamento)-Columbus,OH

Nino Anthony, dj/producer and co-label owner of Portamento Records has 
always had a love and passion for music of all genres. He first made a 
name for himself in 2006 as a producer by releasing tracks on his newly 
formed label at the time, Portamento Records. His first single .Dance 
All Night. was remixed by Italy.s respected producer, Alex Kenji and was

Sat May 31                          SNUFF                        Cincinatti

Burufunk

With over 40 commercial releases on more than 30 labels, his success can 
be measured by his achievements. Burufunk.s debut single, .Freedom,. 
released by Kloud 9 Music and featured on the 1998 Streetbeat 
compilation, Battle on Funky Planet, made the track a hit and propelled 
the artist onto the international stage. As a respected producer and 
pioneer of the breakbeat era, Burufunk kept the ball rolling with 
several other hit singles, including the 2000 release of, .The Dream 
Experience,. on Napzzz and his now infamous, .Outsider,. which was 
featured by Nick Warren on the 2003 Global Underground compilation, 
#024: Reykjavik. After some well deserved international notoriety, many 
more opportunities presented themselves, including one that led to the 
hit Burufunk remix of BT.s, .Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist).. 
Renowned artist and producer, BT .was absolutely knocked sideways!., by 
the brilliantly crafted Burufunk remix, as was the entire dance music 
industry. Knowing it was important to work with other artists and 
performers, Burufunk forged a lifelong relationship with artists like 
Deepsky, DJ Icey, and many more.

Over time, Burufunk managed to perfect his art and build a live 
performance as energetic and creative as the sounds he brings with him. 
>From his .on the fly. sound manipulation, to his custom crafted remixes, 
Burufunk seamlessly crafts his exclusive sets right from the minds of 
his audience. Burufunk has opened for some of the biggest names in the 
industry on the most extravagant stages in the world, including the 
Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference in Miami. It was his 
2006 performance with Carbon Community in Miami, that kicked off their 
Community Funk Tour, and brought his future intentions front and center.

After several years of effective work in the industry, Burufunk teamed 
up with long-time friend and colleague, Brett Holland to help build the 
new Orlando-based indie label Shiznit Recordings, home of the hottest 
cutting edge EDM. Watch for upcoming shows and releases from Burufunk in 
2007, including the monster progressive house single .Serenity,. 
featuring vocals by 3PM, slated for a spring 2007 release on Undermine 
Records.

DJ Lea Luna

At the young age of 24, ear and eye-catching DJ Lea Luna has quite a 
handle on the club scene. She is a lifelong musician: playing keys for 
as far back as she can remember, and spinning records since she wasn't 
even of age to get into the clubs (in the underground rave heydey, 
1999). When a 16 year old girl begins sharpening mixing skills and 
stacking up an arsenal of records and CDs that soon in her life, what 
potential does she already have in the club industry when she turns 21? 
DJ Lea Luna will tell you. She's already played all over the country at 
some of the most prestigious clubs and events the commercial electronic 
scene has. Her remix sets and her 6-foot-blonde stage prowess handed her 
the rockstar nickname "bootlegs." Her crowd-shaking mix of big-room 
club, house, progressive, rock, and retro landed her in the DJ booths of 
clubs such as Avalon New York and B.E.D. Miami. Not only clubs took 
notice. She even rocked the stage with Ultra music fest favorite Kevens, 
as part of his show, and opened for music legends Steven Tyler and Chuck 
Berry. "After these past couple of years, I feel like I've reached a 
level in my artistry that measures up with the best, and I'm ready to 
own it. I recently added my first name to my former DJ name, DJ Luna. To 
me, the name Lea Luna symbolizes the final touch. I've completely 
embodied the artist I've always dreamed of being. I've become the real 
ME." ...and that she has.

Describing Lea's upcoming new release - LUNANIMOUS is one voice, one 
massive. The massive is speaking one
universal language; at every rock show, night club, house party,
through every radio station, in every ipod. Lea Luna's LUNANIMOUS is
a new dialect of the rock-tronica tongue that both the underground
and overground massives can fluently express.

"I started early, I traveled, I learned, I met people... I went through 
all kinds of music training, audio school, and this whole DJ thing 
forever. Now, I've pinpointed my love for this scene, the music, the 
lyric, my life in general, and art in general. I've defined my 
strengths, my own unique style, my inspiration, and my goals to a T. It 
all leads up to this: basically, I've lived my whole life to make this 
new music ROCK and take it to the stage."

DJ B N@$TY

B N@$TY has been making a name for himself all across the country this 
past year. After opening for Lea Luna in Reno, NV in December, they 
decided to team up again for Snuff. With his mind on the scene and the 
scene on his music, B N@$TY is laying down that Speed Garage Sound in a 
city near you. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Dave Digital vs Straight Vizual

Thats right kids, your two favorite Drum-N-Breaks DJ's are going to be 
tearing it up at the gym club. Whether its turntablism, perfect mixing, 
or just sick ass tracks, Dave Digital and Josh Vizual are 2 of the 
Tri-State's favorite tag sets. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

For 10 million it should.  In slightly related topic I've been thinking 
of getting appless ex machina (the movie after the appleseed movie that 
the poster was from as there was also a hand drawn anime version like 12 
years ago or something) on blu ray since I just bought a PS3 a couple 
weeks ago.  I'm sure it would look sic but I still have this mindset 
with blu ray that there is pretty much no way to store the movie on my 
computer so I can watch it without having to put the dvd in.  I don't do 
it often with my dvds, but I still don't like not having the option.  Or 
I guess it just not being as simple as it with dvds.  Plus I then HAVE 
to watch it on the tv when I've watched a lot of stuff on computer 
monitor, can't really take it with me to a friends place to watch it 
since like no one has a blu ray player yet.  I'll probably end up 
getting the planet earth series on blu ray since I've heard nothing but 
good from that and it's good "look what hd can do!"

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tentative DEMF lineup

Only 3 stages? I'd heard the festival proper wasn't going to contain
much awesomeness, but it's usually the afterparties that make it for
me.

Do you know which is which stage between beatport and vitamin water?
(I'm guessing one is underground and the other is the main...)

I'm going regardless, kenny dixon jr is having an afterparty one of
the nights that includes "free soul food while it lasts".  That in
itself is worth the drive to detroit.

Who else is going?  We're staying in the shorecrest (the ponchartrain
is like 350 a night now that it's renovated!).

well last year the underground area was a chill spot type place that had =

video of the other locations.  Beatport was the one right off the lake=20
that was playing DnB last year?  The real detroit WAS in a smallish tent =

to the right of the main stage, maybe they'll put that in the tent to=20
the left?  And then vitamin water is the main stage from the looks of=20
the lineup.

But yeah I'm not too impressed either.  Namely because they close the=20
main stage early and used a lot of 2 hour spots so they didn't have to=20
book as many.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tentative DEMF lineup

So, who is going this year? I missed it last year but hope to make it out t=
his year. I have only ever stayed at the Ren Cen or the Pontch - anyone got=
 good recommendations on other hotels within walking distance to Hart Plaza=
?

I miss me some Deeeetroit.

And indeed, what you can't always find at the festival you WILL find at aft=
erparties in terms of sick music. Besides, Besides who can dance in Hart Pl=
aza while holding a 20 oz cup of beer AND roasted corn? Hmmm?

according to heads on 313@hyperreal, there's also a Red Bull Music
Academy stage that's going to have some garbage like Benny Benassi and
some hipster acts...

i'll be in sunny FLA this year for my "adopted sister's" wedding (you
know...not really family, but might as well be...). so no D 2 years in
a row for me.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Ewun
(Lifted Music, Human Imprint, Evol Intent) - Rochester, NY

Ewun tha Gun delivers tracks that sound like a robot with Turrets 
syndrome on a very serious mission.ù A hint of early 90s ragga-styled 
breakbeat hardcore percolates deep underneath the crust of industrial 
twisted metal mayhem and hardcore hip-hops sibilant cadence. Ewun's 
transatlantic influences have appropriately led to partnerships with 
UK-based labels Barcode Recordings and Lifted Music UK, as well as 
Dieselboy's Human Imprint. The upcoming year promises to reveal several 
tracks of grimey jungalist haze and aggressively smelt percussion. His 
latest tour entitled the Levitation tour is smashing across the U.S. 
sponsored by Lifted Music.

Nino Anthony,(portamento)-Columbus,OH

Nino Anthony, dj/producer and co-label owner of Portamento Records has 
always had a love and passion for music of all genres. He first made a 
name for himself in 2006 as a producer by releasing tracks on his newly 
formed label at the time, Portamento Records. His first single .Dance 
All Night. was remixed by Italy.s respected producer, Alex Kenji and was 
charted by several dj.s including Donald Glaude. Shortly after, his 
remix of David Farlow.s .How I Roll. was charted and supported by Sucker 
Dj.s. Since then Nino has released a whole slew of releases and remixes 
on some of the biggest labels in the world in including Subliminal, 
Juicy Traxx, Pacha Recordings, Eden Recordings, Play Digital, Movement 
Music, Curvve, BugEyed Records, New Era, Cubic, Wagram & Vendetta among 
many others.

Sat May 31                          SNUFF                        Cincinatti

Burufunk

With over 40 commercial releases on more than 30 labels, his success can 
be measured by his achievements. Burufunk.s debut single, .Freedom,. 
released by Kloud 9 Music and featured on the 1998 Streetbeat 
compilation, Battle on Funky Planet, made the track a hit and propelled 
the artist onto the international stage. As a respected producer and 
pioneer of the breakbeat era, Burufunk kept the ball rolling with 
several other hit singles, including the 2000 release of, .The Dream 
Experience,. on Napzzz and his now infamous, .Outsider,. which was 
featured by Nick Warren on the 2003 Global Underground compilation, 
#024: Reykjavik. After some well deserved international notoriety, many 
more opportunities presented themselves, including one that led to the 
hit Burufunk remix of BT.s, .Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist).. 
Renowned artist and producer, BT .was absolutely knocked sideways!., by 
the brilliantly crafted Burufunk remix, as was the entire dance music 
industry. Knowing it was important to work with other artists and 
performers, Burufunk forged a lifelong relationship with artists like 
Deepsky, DJ Icey, and many more.

Over time, Burufunk managed to perfect his art and build a live 
performance as energetic and creative as the sounds he brings with him. 
>From his .on the fly. sound manipulation, to his custom crafted remixes, 
Burufunk seamlessly crafts his exclusive sets right from the minds of 
his audience. Burufunk has opened for some of the biggest names in the 
industry on the most extravagant stages in the world, including the 
Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference in Miami. It was his 
2006 performance with Carbon Community in Miami, that kicked off their 
Community Funk Tour, and brought his future intentions front and center.

After several years of effective work in the industry, Burufunk teamed 
up with long-time friend and colleague, Brett Holland to help build the 
new Orlando-based indie label Shiznit Recordings, home of the hottest 
cutting edge EDM. Watch for upcoming shows and releases from Burufunk in 
2007, including the monster progressive house single .Serenity,. 
featuring vocals by 3PM, slated for a spring 2007 release on Undermine 
Records.

DJ Lea Luna

At the young age of 24, ear and eye-catching DJ Lea Luna has quite a 
handle on the club scene. She is a lifelong musician: playing keys for 
as far back as she can remember, and spinning records since she wasn't 
even of age to get into the clubs (in the underground rave heydey, 
1999). When a 16 year old girl begins sharpening mixing skills and 
stacking up an arsenal of records and CDs that soon in her life, what 
potential does she already have in the club industry when she turns 21? 
DJ Lea Luna will tell you. She's already played all over the country at 
some of the most prestigious clubs and events the commercial electronic 
scene has. Her remix sets and her 6-foot-blonde stage prowess handed her 
the rockstar nickname "bootlegs." Her crowd-shaking mix of big-room 
club, house, progressive, rock, and retro landed her in the DJ booths of 
clubs such as Avalon New York and B.E.D. Miami. Not only clubs took 
notice. She even rocked the stage with Ultra music fest favorite Kevens, 
as part of his show, and opened for music legends Steven Tyler and Chuck 
Berry. "After these past couple of years, I feel like I've reached a 
level in my artistry that measures up with the best, and I'm ready to 
own it. I recently added my first name to my former DJ name, DJ Luna. To 
me, the name Lea Luna symbolizes the final touch. I've completely 
embodied the artist I've always dreamed of being. I've become the real 
ME." ...and that she has.

Describing Lea's upcoming new release - LUNANIMOUS is one voice, one 
massive. The massive is speaking one
universal language; at every rock show, night club, house party,
through every radio station, in every ipod. Lea Luna's LUNANIMOUS is
a new dialect of the rock-tronica tongue that both the underground
and overground massives can fluently express.

"I started early, I traveled, I learned, I met people... I went through 
all kinds of music training, audio school, and this whole DJ thing 
forever. Now, I've pinpointed my love for this scene, the music, the 
lyric, my life in general, and art in general. I've defined my 
strengths, my own unique style, my inspiration, and my goals to a T. It 
all leads up to this: basically, I've lived my whole life to make this 
new music ROCK and take it to the stage."

DJ B N@$TY

B N@$TY has been making a name for himself all across the country this 
past year. After opening for Lea Luna in Reno, NV in December, they 
decided to team up again for Snuff. With his mind on the scene and the 
scene on his music, B N@$TY is laying down that Speed Garage Sound in a 
city near you. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

I am appalled that Albert Hofmann's death hasn't made it onto the
Associate Press wires at Salon.com. Personally, I would consider this
bigger news than whatever the fuck Britney spears has been doing or
whoever is doing whatever in the brain-dead world of popular sports. But I
digress.

R.I.P. Albert Hofmann. He was 102.
