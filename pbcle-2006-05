Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} a mix from the archives

This is an old mix I did that I came across and I think it is a pretty
enjoyable listen.  Decided to bring it out of the archives and post
it.

jbible - myxbilym mix
http://www.experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D115
Came across this old all vinyl dj mix I recorded in 2001 on an old
disk. Probably one of my favorite ones I had done. Contains tracks by
Brothom States, Lexaunculpt, Boards of Canada, EU, Richard Devine,
Tipper, Autechre, and Phoenecia if I remember all the tracks
correctly.

Traaaat lives like a mile away from a white castle.  I stop there

No white castle is the downside to canada, too.  Aside from the weather.

I don't know what the big kafuffle about White Castle is....

but there's all those tim hortons.  i think they outnumber starbucks up 
there.  i think bill once got directions from a local that were given by 
tim hortons rather than blocks.  go till you see a tim hortons, then 
turn....  go to the tim hortons and ....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kool-aid pics

my picashures are at
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/2006-04-29-kool-aid-electrolaid-punch

quasi-review cut-n-pasted from mah blog:

last night we went down to pgh for electrolaid koolade punch (yah, i
keep screwing up the name, dont have such weird names and i wont!)

never heard of the place before - 9 over 9th.  awesome venue.  like a
mid sized room with an outdoor balcony for the 2nd stage.  you could see
across pgh from the balcony stage. very nice.  i forgot about the
outdoor part so i left my fleece in the car.  whooopsie!  could have
used that coz it did get chilly outside in the wee hours....

music was pretty solid thru the night.  no heather heart (yey!) so
frankie bones did a 3 hour set, covering her time.   normally frankie
bones puts me to sleep and i never understood why promoters would pay
this guy to kill a dance floor, but this set was hard bangin shit with
some aceeeeeiiid thrown in here and there.  i think he played all of the
dave clarke reds.

cutups playing what he plays, todd k doing the rewind whether geoff
wanted it or not.  hahah.  colin/naoko were pretty solid.  ratana and
kirby dropped some fun bass rollers.

an interesting observation was that the place went bonkers when sirius
went on, and cleared out when he was done.   read what you want into
that. (hardcore will never die!)

stacy dressed as tangerine, the mega-orange kool-aid.   it was the hawtness

saw lots of people i havent seen in ages.  silverraver, bagina, poopy
the bday girl, polar bear, victor the old security guy.  and shitloads more.

one interesting thing was i talked to probably 10 kids who said this was
their first party ever.  where these kids came from is beyond me.  we
did run one kid home, so i got to pick his brain about why he came out.
comes down to he knew someone involved with the party, but he really had
no idea what to expect.  everyone i talked to loved it, some wanted to
know when the next one was (tricky question!)

after that we went to the kellys house and chilled--to uber-happy music
because dave clarke is psychosis inducing.  i wouldn't believe it but i
did see it, scurry.  damn.  so we popped in the 'cheddar vengeance vol
3' mix to make things uberplurry.  always a good time at the kellys.
caught up with everyone.  met new people.  saw old people.  it was a
very good night.  hopefully pgh can follow up from this and have more
parties like this.

I had just missed John when I was in London January.. Glad he's making 
his rounds though. I may end up at this one.

Subject: {pb-cle} just saw this one - kid koala

somewhere in pgh, dunno where CFA lawn is


AB Coffeehouse, AB Special Events
Friday, 5/5 @ 8:30 PM
CFA Lawn (Where is this venue?)
Price FREE!!!
Running Time Approx. 1.5 hours

The show will take place on the CFA Lawn (rainsite UC Wiegand
Gymnasium). The event is free to all and open to the public.
Chinese-Canadian turntablist Kid Koala was born Eric San in Vancouver,
British Columbia, in 1975. Classically trained on the piano, San instead
put his fingers to work on a pair of Technics 1200s starting in the late
'80s. He was a college pub DJ and bedroom turntable manipulator for
nearly a decade before landing a recording deal with U.K. experimental
hip-hop duo Coldcut's Ninja Tune imprint in 1997. San's eclectic
approach to sound collage is actually closer to the latter's far-flung
beat experiments than the old-school New York and L.A. references which
most often form the canon of the scratch DJ's art. It's also a
circle-closer of sorts: San's nascent mixing aesthetic was influenced
early on by classic Coldcut records such as "(Hey Kids) What Time Is
It?" and their "7 Minutes of Madness" massacre of Eric B. & Rakim's
"Paid in Full." In fact, the coincidence of Koala signing to his heroes'
label (despite the fact that it's based thousands of miles away and home
mostly to instrumental trip-hop and computer-funk producers) was less a
coincidence than it would at first appear San managed to arrange an
"inadvertent" car ride with the group when their label's Stealth tour
passed through Montreal in 1996, making sure his mix tape,
Scratchappyland, was in the car stereo well beforehand. Excerpts from
that tape doubled as Kid Koala's identically titled solo debut when
Ninja Tune, duly impressed, released it as a 10" in July of 1997. Koala
also appeared on the second volume of The Bomb's Return of the DJ
compilation with his track "Static's Waltz," another excerpt from his
mix tape. Subsequent Ninja Tune releases included Kid Koala remixes of
DJ Food's "Scratch Yer Head" and (fittingly) Coldcut's classic "Beats
and Pieces," plus the 2000 full-length Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The
follow-up Some of My Best Friends Are DJ's appeared in 2003.

CFA Lawn is CMU.  5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh.  Look around for the
long stretch of grass, it's at the far end, in front of the College of
Fine Arts (CFA).

[OUTPUT MESSAGE] - Live PA - Born in Queens, New York, in 1983, spending his 
formative middle-school years in New Jersey, and finally ending up in 
Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka
Outputmessage) can be given that rare title of "young musical prodigy." 
During
his time in New Jersey, he first became fascinated with a broad range of 
music,
eventually keying in on electronic; and when his family got its first 
computer
in the summer of 1998, he began making music on his own. Now, while a
mathematics graduate student at Virginia Tech, he spends his off time 
writing
tight, hook-laden tracks. Outputmessage debuted with a remix of Dabrye on 
the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a track ("Bernards 
Song") on Ghostly's Idol Tryouts
compilation before even turning 20. Later the Oneiros EP was released on 
Echelon
Productions. This year "Sommeil" was released on the Ghostly's Idol Tryouts 
Two
compilation and Outputmessage's debut LP, Nebulae, is set to drop this June 
on
Melodic.  Outputmessage was also recently selected to be in URB's Next 100.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

Fri May 05                        KID KOALA                      Pittsburgh

AB Coffeehouse, AB Special Events  	
Friday, 5/5 @ 8:30 PM
CFA Lawn
Price 	FREE!!!
Running Time 	Approx. 1.5 hours

CFA Lawn is CMU.  5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh.  Look around for the
long stretch of grass, it's at the far end, in front of the College of
Fine Arts (CFA).

The show will take place on the CFA Lawn (rainsite UC Wiegand
Gymnasium). The event is free to all and open to the public. 
Chinese-Canadian turntablist Kid Koala was born Eric San in Vancouver,
British Columbia, in 1975. Classically trained on the piano, San instead
put his fingers to work on a pair of Technics 1200s starting in the late
'80s. He was a college pub DJ and bedroom turntable manipulator for
nearly a decade before landing a recording deal with U.K. experimental
hip-hop duo Coldcut's Ninja Tune imprint in 1997. San's eclectic
approach to sound collage is actually closer to the latter's far-flung
beat experiments than the old-school New York and L.A. references which
most often form the canon of the scratch DJ's art. It's also a
circle-closer of sorts: San's nascent mixing aesthetic was influenced
early on by classic Coldcut records such as "(Hey Kids) What Time Is
It?" and their "7 Minutes of Madness" massacre of Eric B. & Rakim's
"Paid in Full." In fact, the coincidence of Koala signing to his heroes'
label (despite the fact that it's based thousands of miles away and home
mostly to instrumental trip-hop and computer-funk producers) was less a
coincidence than it would at first appear San managed to arrange an
"inadvertent" car ride with the group when their label's Stealth tour
passed through Montreal in 1996, making sure his mix tape,
Scratchappyland, was in the car stereo well beforehand. Excerpts from
that tape doubled as Kid Koala's identically titled solo debut when
Ninja Tune, duly impressed, released it as a 10" in July of 1997. Koala
also appeared on the second volume of The Bomb's Return of the DJ
compilation with his track "Static's Waltz," another excerpt from his
mix tape. Subsequent Ninja Tune releases included Kid Koala remixes of
DJ Food's "Scratch Yer Head" and (fittingly) Coldcut's classic "Beats
and Pieces," plus the 2000 full-length Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The
follow-up Some of My Best Friends Are DJ's appeared in 2003.

In:Verse [Mathmatics] | Touch | Wed 5.17.06

MATHMATICS
(Social Studies)
NYC

As a veteran DJ act, Mathematics is known for creating a unique vibe; 
blending soulfulness with dancefloor beats, making a wicked deep party 
atmosphere. Mathematics have recently launched their own imprint Social 
Studies distributed worldwide by Load Media.

Upcoming releases include the 12" Jazz b/w Sphinx (due out winter 2005) 
getting played by Fabio and DJ Flight among others. After that we will 
hear two singles themed Mathematical Tactics featuring collaborations 
between Maths and the Hungarian bad boys, Tactile. Also watch out for a 
collaboration with Mijatoho from Zurich.

While drum 'n' bass made in America has long been ignored by the largely 
UK-dominated scene, this talented duo has been heartily welcomed by the 
DJ fraternity in England, having had their music released on high 
profile labels such as Hospital, CIA, Defunked, Frontline, Renegade Rec. 
among others and played by the likes of LTJ Bukem, Bryan Gee, DJ Hype, 
Marcus Intalex, Total Science, High Contrast, DJ Lee, Nookie, London 
Elektricity, Blame, Calibre, L Double and Bailey, amongst others.

Worldwide support, both in and outside of drum 'n' bass, has come from 
DJ Marky, Patife and XRS from Brasil, Dieselboy, Dara, Juju and AK1200 
in the US, as well as eclectic heavyweights Les Gammas, Adam Goldstone, 
and Jason Bentley

On Friday, May 19th, 2006, join SoulGlo, Night Vision and S.Simpson in 
welcoming Cass.

CASS
London, UK - Sabotage / Industry 88

with guests:
Matt Monroe (SoulGlo, Dynamix Crew, InnerChild)
Philo (Night Vision)

.Muse: Any of the nine daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus, each of whom 
presided over a different art or science; a guiding spirit; a source of 
inspiration; a poet. - dictionary.com

This is perhaps one of the most daunting tasks that I have been asked to 
accomplish in some time. I have been presented with the challenge of 
introducing you, the audience, to one of the most influential 
DJ/producers that I have ever heard. To state that this man has been my 
guide - the epitome of all that I hold dear within this musical medium - 
would be akin to comparing my words to the poetic prose of Milton. In 
short, the parallel is crude.

In the world of the mundane, I could take the worn-torn path of the 
common man. I could dictate the facts that each could find on your own 
with little to no exertion. I can recite Cass. statistics with the 
apathetic manner in which most are familiar: Cass was born in London in 
the year of 1973; he was exposed to a wide variety of music at an early 
age and made a name for himself in Sydney; has traveled the world over, 
and over again, exposing the masses to his twisted union of tech-house, 
progressive, and breaks; he has managed many record labels in his day 
including: Flying Rhino, FIRE, and Sabotage.. But, alas, these facts 
offer little in the way sustenance, and will only leave you hollow 
inside, unfulfilled.

In exchange, I offer these raw, unsheltered, vehicles of emotion to 
convey my thoughts: dark, swank, queer, sensual, bent, primal, twisted, 
skewed, fucked, waylaid, insatiable, unconventional, alluring, 
tranquility, deviancy, foreboding, captivating, fixation, addiction, 
domination, submission, resurrection, ascension, validation. Perhaps 
their simplicity can persuade you to attend where my feeble rhetoric 
cannot. - firefan999

alex bau - biography
 

alexs dj-sets, full of energy and devotion, turned dancefloors into 
total excess since 1992. his versatile selection of tracks, ranging from 
minimal to more hard edged technotracks, always develop a flow by 
keeping his very own but versatile style. The co-founder of toneman 
always gets people on his side until the last record has been played, 
mostly after several hours of extreme-partying

this approach to music is the result of a long career in the underground 
dance music industry, which began in the early 90's when spinning 
different kinds of dance music in his hometown and neighboring cities. 
in the very beginning, he recalls introducing early techno into his sets  
with moderate success, but he nevertheless dedicated his entire career 
to techno music. alex's musical aspirations have been inspired by 
composers such as roland orzabald (tear for fears), martin gore (depeche 
mode) and more ebm or 80ies synthiepop acts just to name a few.

in his sets, alex obeys to the old-school ethics of not just playing the 
hits but creating a story, even if he sometimes has to squeeze the whole 
set into a couple of hours. his experience as a radio- and club-resident 
dj from 1994 to 1996 and later on gigs throughout germany, austria, 
switzerland, czech republic, croatia, yugoslavia, hungary, poland, 
holland, canada or even romania or brasil has led him to win the hearts 
of an audience that is constantly growing in number. no matter what 
country on the world, booking alex means booking high quality, always 
grooving, sometimes minimal, sometimes hard techno that is brought to 
the audience by an artist with extraordinary solid skills on the decks 
paired with a huge amount of entertainment factor by the dj himself. 
this has also enabled him to apply his dance floor knowledge in the 
production studio where he creates potent club tracks with his partner 
and label mate sven dedek under monikers as basic implant, electric 
envoy and alex bau when these are his proper productions. Especially his 
first album .connected. was a clear statement by alex how .pure techno. 
looks like on his definition: versatile, entertaining, 
dancefloor-compatible and technically produced on the maximum level. no 
wonder that .connected. appears in the playlist of numerrous top-dj`s.

alex has released eps for fine audio, parasound, energy industries, 
rotation (dave angel's), toneman (his own), clr (chris liebing`s), 
pv-records (pascal feos), predicaments (justin berkovi`s) and default 
recordings. beside this he has remixed tracks for chris liebing and 
pascal feos. in addition to producing tracks for labels all around the 
globe, alex always consists on being recognized as a dj in a different 
kind of view beside the fact that of course his production style also 
reflects his musical preferences . pure techno, sometimes minimal, 
sometimes fat. in his eyes, the quality of a dj can not be measured with 
the number of releases.

co-promoting the legendary 'Overboard' night whilst running the 
excellent Matter/:Form label. Francis's former productions can be found 
on Surreal, Big Chief and End Recordings to name a few, with

MNML Variation (Andy Vaz) | Cleveland | Sat 7.1.2006
$10
All ages
Virgin venue!

Once again Tek-Know is proud to bring in some of the biggest talent in 
the techno scene for you listening enjoyment. We will be pulling out the 
stops for this one, brand new virgin venue, 20,000 watts of RMS goodness 
and more.

Andy Vaz - Background Records, [--] - Germany
Andy Vaz hails from Dsseldorf, Germany. Andy manages and curates 
Background Recordings. Andy has been a pinnacle cornerstone of the 
German electronic music movement. He is highly regarded as one of the 
essential individuals on the global front for providing a cultural 
conduit for electronic music, between Dsseldorf, San Francisco, 
Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, London, South Africa and countless other 
cities around the world. Background recordings has been a major force in 
the presentation of minimal techno, introducing and educating the world 
to the geographic variable influences that exist within the genre.

In 2000, Andy Vaz has released his own material. After many years of 
work in the studio, Andy was reluctant to release his music. taking the 
time needed to polish and refine the sound, and feel that it was on par 
with his contemporaries, his first 12", "Sounds Variation 1-1" was met 
with incredible international acclaim. Sounds_variation is based on the 
use of the same sounds, re-used throughout, giving each track another 
musical approach by pushing each instrument in a different compositional 
direction by re-arrangement, toneshifting and by adding/changing effects 
in order to demonstrate that a defined production criteria brings forth 
maximal results through the process of limitation within a lo-fi 
aesthetic. The first edition of the Andy Vaz vinyl series on the elusive 
and nameless label is therefore entitled [---].

1 Auxy - Tek-Know - Cleveland
This hometown show stealer is ready willing and working overtime to 
bring
it raw like we all know he does.

Andy James - Berretta Records - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland
What can we say about this hometown hero? No seriously it.s all been 
said
already.

NINJA'S of MINIMAL MADNESS: Jimi Tsang & Jason Allen
Mentor (Tsang) and apprentice (Allen) have combined their differences in 
music preference to deliver dance floors a ball of minimal wax that 
penetrates your left ear, melts your brain for 37 nanoseconds, then 
exits the right ear leaving you on the floor saying "holy eargasm 
batman!". Listen to the ninja's of minimal madness kick you in the ear 
with the bleeps, the sweeps and the creeps!

Random(seed) - Tek-Know - Cleveland
Tek-Know founder and beatman look for some original material randomly 
dispersed in his set on this special night

Chad Dolis - Restrukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland
Teacher by day of high thoughts and social concepts and teacher by night 
on how to throw down techno till your ears bleed this rising star has 
more skill in his middle finger than most cities could muster as a 
whole.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).



John B

John B
Beta Recordings, MMI
UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB
http://www.spreeandadb.com/
DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

that last link there makes me really want to find a hi-quality audio
recording of this show...

they mixed "technologic" with busta's "touch it" which samples their
vocal line....i love it...it's totally self-referential and
tongue-in-cheek...

yeah the preamp circuit can be made with a couple $$$ of off the shelf
parts.  i used to have one i made, no mixer needed, it was nice until i
smooshed it under some junk.

Subject: {pb-cle} Less than 2 weeks till Japan!!1!!one

OK, so if you don't know yet I'm taking a vacation in Japan from May 19
to June 2.  Well I'm going to do one of those travel blogs with all the
"ZOMG JAPAN IS SWEET" posts.  I was going to post this around twice but
figured I'll just do it once, if you're interested bookmark the site, if
not, don't :)

http://japan.vrillusions.com/

I'll try to post some pictures up if I have time every night but
probably not.  So yeah I can't wait.  This is going to be the first real
big vacation I've ever been on.  Yes, I'm going to miss DEMF, but we
wanted to do this around labor day so we got an extra vacation day off
work :)

It's got a USB interface for sending the audio data, rather than the coax.. which is handy, because a lot of computers (including mine) don't have a coax digital in, and in my case, my laptop doesn't do too well at recording line level sources either...

Could be a handy doodad if I were digitizing a lot of vinyl..

It's High speed record feature might be nice... I'd have to test it

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} oh noes!

The high speed recording worries me.  Needles are only designed for
certain speeds.  I could see maybe recording a 33 and 1/3 record at 45,
but seems like you would still lose something because the record isn't
designed for that speed.

So far I've ripped vinyl the same way Smithsonian is archiving stuff.
Normal turntable going through a mixer and into the computer (I think
the Smithsonian may just have one of those little circuit boards to
handle the gain) I play the record at normal speed and I dip a q-tip
into distilled water and put that just 'ahead' of the needle so it kinda
glides in the water.  Removes as much of the record noise as possible.
Also a nice side effect is it really cleans the records well :)  Only
done it to a couple records so far.

Well, if you play at high speed (33 1/3 record at 45rpm) then you're going to lose some high frequencies..

For instance, if your needle is responsive up to 17KHz, when you reduce the speed of the recording back down you'll only get frequencies up to about 13KHz..

Or if you have a needle with ungodly high responsiveness, you'll run into nyquist rate problems.. Standard WAV file can only record up to about 22KHz, and if you did a recording at 45rpm and slowed it down to 33 1/3, you'd only and up with usable data up to about 16.5KHz..

Although.. since the high frequencies are recorded so hot on the vinyl itself.. maybe the data being sent over USB is more heaily weighted on the high end to make up for some of the losses you run into..

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Wed May 17                       MATHEMATICS                      Cleveland

In:Verse [Mathmatics] | Touch | Wed 5.17.06

MATHMATICS
(Social Studies)
NYC

As a veteran DJ act, Mathematics is known for creating a unique vibe; 
blending soulfulness with dancefloor beats, making a wicked deep party 
atmosphere. Mathematics have recently launched their own imprint Social 
Studies distributed worldwide by Load Media.

Upcoming releases include the 12" Jazz b/w Sphinx (due out winter 2005) 
getting played by Fabio and DJ Flight among others. After that we will 
hear two singles themed Mathematical Tactics featuring collaborations 
between Maths and the Hungarian bad boys, Tactile. Also watch out for a 
collaboration with Mijatoho from Zurich.

While drum 'n' bass made in America has long been ignored by the largely 
UK-dominated scene, this talented duo has been heartily welcomed by the 
DJ fraternity in England, having had their music released on high 
profile labels such as Hospital, CIA, Defunked, Frontline, Renegade Rec. 
among others and played by the likes of LTJ Bukem, Bryan Gee, DJ Hype, 
Marcus Intalex, Total Science, High Contrast, DJ Lee, Nookie, London 
Elektricity, Blame, Calibre, L Double and Bailey, amongst others.

Worldwide support, both in and outside of drum 'n' bass, has come from 
DJ Marky, Patife and XRS from Brasil, Dieselboy, Dara, Juju and AK1200 
in the US, as well as eclectic heavyweights Les Gammas, Adam Goldstone, 
and Jason Bentley

On Friday, May 19th, 2006, join SoulGlo, Night Vision and S.Simpson in 
welcoming Cass.

CASS
London, UK - Sabotage / Industry 88

with guests:
Matt Monroe (SoulGlo, Dynamix Crew, InnerChild)
Philo (Night Vision)

.Muse: Any of the nine daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus, each of whom 
presided over a different art or science; a guiding spirit; a source of 
inspiration; a poet. - dictionary.com

This is perhaps one of the most daunting tasks that I have been asked to 
accomplish in some time. I have been presented with the challenge of 
introducing you, the audience, to one of the most influential 
DJ/producers that I have ever heard. To state that this man has been my 
guide - the epitome of all that I hold dear within this musical medium - 
would be akin to comparing my words to the poetic prose of Milton. In 
short, the parallel is crude.

In the world of the mundane, I could take the worn-torn path of the 
common man. I could dictate the facts that each could find on your own 
with little to no exertion. I can recite Cass. statistics with the 
apathetic manner in which most are familiar: Cass was born in London in 
the year of 1973; he was exposed to a wide variety of music at an early 
age and made a name for himself in Sydney; has traveled the world over, 
and over again, exposing the masses to his twisted union of tech-house, 
progressive, and breaks; he has managed many record labels in his day 
including: Flying Rhino, FIRE, and Sabotage.. But, alas, these facts 
offer little in the way sustenance, and will only leave you hollow 
inside, unfulfilled.

In exchange, I offer these raw, unsheltered, vehicles of emotion to 
convey my thoughts: dark, swank, queer, sensual, bent, primal, twisted, 
skewed, fucked, waylaid, insatiable, unconventional, alluring, 
tranquility, deviancy, foreboding, captivating, fixation, addiction, 
domination, submission, resurrection, ascension, validation. Perhaps 
their simplicity can persuade you to attend where my feeble rhetoric 
cannot. - firefan999

alex bau - biography
 

alexs dj-sets, full of energy and devotion, turned dancefloors into 
total excess since 1992. his versatile selection of tracks, ranging from 
minimal to more hard edged technotracks, always develop a flow by 
keeping his very own but versatile style. The co-founder of toneman 
always gets people on his side until the last record has been played, 
mostly after several hours of extreme-partying

this approach to music is the result of a long career in the underground 
dance music industry, which began in the early 90's when spinning 
different kinds of dance music in his hometown and neighboring cities. 
in the very beginning, he recalls introducing early techno into his sets  
with moderate success, but he nevertheless dedicated his entire career 
to techno music. alex's musical aspirations have been inspired by 
composers such as roland orzabald (tear for fears), martin gore (depeche 
mode) and more ebm or 80ies synthiepop acts just to name a few.

in his sets, alex obeys to the old-school ethics of not just playing the 
hits but creating a story, even if he sometimes has to squeeze the whole 
set into a couple of hours. his experience as a radio- and club-resident 
dj from 1994 to 1996 and later on gigs throughout germany, austria, 
switzerland, czech republic, croatia, yugoslavia, hungary, poland, 
holland, canada or even romania or brasil has led him to win the hearts 
of an audience that is constantly growing in number. no matter what 
country on the world, booking alex means booking high quality, always 
grooving, sometimes minimal, sometimes hard techno that is brought to 
the audience by an artist with extraordinary solid skills on the decks 
paired with a huge amount of entertainment factor by the dj himself. 
this has also enabled him to apply his dance floor knowledge in the 
production studio where he creates potent club tracks with his partner 
and label mate sven dedek under monikers as basic implant, electric 
envoy and alex bau when these are his proper productions. Especially his 
first album .connected. was a clear statement by alex how .pure techno. 
looks like on his definition: versatile, entertaining, 
dancefloor-compatible and technically produced on the maximum level. no 
wonder that .connected. appears in the playlist of numerrous top-dj`s.

alex has released eps for fine audio, parasound, energy industries, 
rotation (dave angel's), toneman (his own), clr (chris liebing`s), 
pv-records (pascal feos), predicaments (justin berkovi`s) and default 
recordings. beside this he has remixed tracks for chris liebing and 
pascal feos. in addition to producing tracks for labels all around the 
globe, alex always consists on being recognized as a dj in a different 
kind of view beside the fact that of course his production style also 
reflects his musical preferences . pure techno, sometimes minimal, 
sometimes fat. in his eyes, the quality of a dj can not be measured with 
the number of releases.

The Sycophant Slags
(Mr. C. & Francis Harris - Halcyon, Superfreq, The End, Made)

This is one hell of a combination... The Sycophant Slags are none other 
than London's Mr. C and New York's Francis Harris. Mr. C needs no 
introduction, one of the most influential, ever present forces on 
London's House scene, both on vinyl via releases on the Plink Plonk and 
End Recordings imprints and in the clubs as an international DJ and Co 
Owner of the much adored End Club.

Francis Harris (Adultnapper) is a key figure on the New York Club scene, 
co-promoting the legendary 'Overboard' night whilst running the 
excellent Matter/:Form label. Francis's former productions can be found 
on Surreal, Big Chief and End Recordings to name a few, with 
collaborators including Dave Mothersole, Adam Collins and Erich Lee.

MNML Variation (Andy Vaz) | Cleveland | Sat 7.1.2006
$10
All ages
Virgin venue!

Once again Tek-Know is proud to bring in some of the biggest talent in 
the techno scene for you listening enjoyment. We will be pulling out the 
stops for this one, brand new virgin venue, 20,000 watts of RMS goodness 
and more.

Andy Vaz - Background Records, [--] - Germany
Andy Vaz hails from Dsseldorf, Germany. Andy manages and curates 
Background Recordings. Andy has been a pinnacle cornerstone of the 
German electronic music movement. He is highly regarded as one of the 
essential individuals on the global front for providing a cultural 
conduit for electronic music, between Dsseldorf, San Francisco, 
Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, London, South Africa and countless other 
cities around the world. Background recordings has been a major force in 
the presentation of minimal techno, introducing and educating the world 
to the geographic variable influences that exist within the genre.

In 2000, Andy Vaz has released his own material. After many years of 
work in the studio, Andy was reluctant to release his music. taking the 
time needed to polish and refine the sound, and feel that it was on par 
with his contemporaries, his first 12", "Sounds Variation 1-1" was met 
with incredible international acclaim. Sounds_variation is based on the 
use of the same sounds, re-used throughout, giving each track another 
musical approach by pushing each instrument in a different compositional 
direction by re-arrangement, toneshifting and by adding/changing effects 
in order to demonstrate that a defined production criteria brings forth 
maximal results through the process of limitation within a lo-fi 
aesthetic. The first edition of the Andy Vaz vinyl series on the elusive 
and nameless label is therefore entitled [---].

1 Auxy - Tek-Know - Cleveland
This hometown show stealer is ready willing and working overtime to 
bring

Andy James - Berretta Records - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland
What can we say about this hometown hero? No seriously it.s all been 
said
already.

NINJA'S of MINIMAL MADNESS: Jimi Tsang & Jason Allen
Mentor (Tsang) and apprentice (Allen) have combined their differences in 
music preference to deliver dance floors a ball of minimal wax that 
penetrates your left ear, melts your brain for 37 nanoseconds, then 
exits the right ear leaving you on the floor saying "holy eargasm 
batman!". Listen to the ninja's of minimal madness kick you in the ear 
with the bleeps, the sweeps and the creeps!

Random(seed) - Tek-Know - Cleveland
Tek-Know founder and beatman look for some original material randomly 
dispersed in his set on this special night

Chad Dolis - Restrukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland
Teacher by day of high thoughts and social concepts and teacher by night 
on how to throw down techno till your ears bleed this rising star has 
more skill in his middle finger than most cities could muster as a 
whole.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).



John B
http://www.beta-recordings.co.uk/

John B
Beta Recordings, MMI
UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB
http://www.spreeandadb.com/
DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

[OUTPUT MESSAGE] - Live PA - Born in Queens, New York, in 1983, spending his 
formative middle-school years in New Jersey, and finally ending up in 
Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka
Outputmessage) can be given that rare title of "young musical prodigy." 
During
his time in New Jersey, he first became fascinated with a broad range of 
music,
eventually keying in on electronic; and when his family got its first 
computer
in the summer of 1998, he began making music on his own. Now, while a
mathematics graduate student at Virginia Tech, he spends his off time 
writing
tight, hook-laden tracks. Outputmessage debuted with a remix of Dabrye on 
the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a track ("Bernards 
Song") on Ghostly's Idol Tryouts
compilation before even turning 20. Later the Oneiros EP was released on 
Echelon
Productions. This year "Sommeil" was released on the Ghostly's Idol Tryouts 
Two
compilation and Outputmessage's debut LP, Nebulae, is set to drop this June 
on
Melodic.  Outputmessage was also recently selected to be in URB's Next 100.

EXP037 - WREXSOUL - ALCHEMY SOUND LP
http://www.experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D116

Wrexsoul returns after a long absence with his follow-up to the
'Accelerating The Sun' EP and his debut Experimedia LP 'Alechemy
Sound'. Whereas his first EP focused heavily on Orb-like ambient
trance and crunchy rhythmic elements worthy of Dissolved, this
collection pushes Wrexsoul's sound in some new directions. This time
around, we hear a shift towards playful, 8-bit type sounds & more
pronouncedly glitchy beatwork (think Orange Dust). He has not,
however, abandoned his sense of lush greenery. This album packs in
about as much dense spacial textures as your likes to find this side
of a Brian Eno LP. A sense of subtlety is also on display, likened to
the minimalism piano compositions of Erik Satie. The point is: this
album covers MAD terrain with the greatest of ease and proficiency.
You will NOT be disappointed. Wrexsoul is comin up in the
world.[/grey]

hooray for technology

Actually, if they're trained to find the difference between the  
chemicals used on real dvd media and what's used in dvd-r media.  You  
could at least sniff out where homemade dvds are.  But then who knows  
if it's just family pictures or king kong.  Then you have the whole  
issue of people copying their dvd's so the can keep the originals  
locked away and prevent them from getting damage.  Although I think  
that's still consider pirating according to MPAA.  I don't think  
you're allowed to make a personal backup of cd's either.  Aparently  
fair use doesn't apply any more.  Although RIAA has recently said  
it's ok for people to rip their cd's to the computer.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rave from your home computer

Ehh, that's nothing too new. It reminds me of SecondLife, which I
never really understood.

Basically people sit at their computers for 12+ hours a day with
scripted dances moving their avatars around. There's support for
shoutcast streams in the program, so the "property owners" usually
turn on Club977 or something equally as horrendous.

The bizarre part? People spend up to and over $2000 a month to get
actual entertainment "virtually", host their events on "private
islands" (servers), and whatnot.

I used to make about $50 a week USD until the whole thing drove me insane.

No Miles Maeda?  His mixtapes are the best and stand out from anyone's
I've ever heard.  He can cover techno, dnb, downtempo, house and
everything in between.

Yeah I'm on SecondLife.  Not as hardcore as some of the people there,  
though.  I have the stream for my land set to DI.fm classic  
techno :)  I know some guy making a few hundred bucks a week on there  
from some simple thing he made that when you type it looks like  
you're writing on a sketchpad.  I wanted to get into scripting but so  
far haven't done anything and haven't made any money in there yet.

The "red light districts" are hillarious.

I'm on there as Eon Mauriac for the interested, even though I only go  
on there every few days.

hybridized with Marx since i love my socialism)

Totally understood...Live it is usually some form a vocally house that is
rather unremarkable.  The studio mix tapes are another level.  Some of the
tracks on his tapes from the mid 90s are still fresh and still show up in
the "new bin".

Seriously, if you don't catch someone taking six hours to pirate
something, you deserve to get ripped off.

On the other hand...this, if it returns quality results (which I
sincerely doubt) could be pretty helpful for rare stuff.

I'm half tempted to try it.  Parents have a bunch of old records they  
said I could "rummage through, but don't touch the saturday night  
fever album" so maybe try with some old country record they have or  
something :)

I just looked at the comments and saw someone mention the high cost,  
so looked it up on smooth-on.com.  The OOMOO 30 (the silicone you use  
to make the initial mold) is $132.19 for a gallon.  TASK 4 (the  
liquid plastic used to make the actual record) is $123.65.  One guy  
said it would take half a gallon of the OOMOO 30 to make the initial  
mold.  Not sure how much of the TASK 4 you'd need.  Still a lot more  
expensive than just ripping to the computer and burning a CD.  Or how  
much is it to just make a dub plate? like $80 or something?  Although  
one guy posted that he's been doing it for over a year, so I guess it  
does work .  Just depends if it's worth the $100 to make one.  I'll  
still with just ripping to the computer.  Expand my huge library  
of... one record recorded to the computer :)

wow. at that rate, it's cheaper to buy serato or final scratch or
something equally technologically advanced, a big ass hard drive and
not encode the tracks to mp3...just play them out as wav files.

do either of those programs mentioned let you play/manipulate
24bit/96khz wav files?

Subject: {pb-cle} CASS (of Cass & Mangan / Cass & Slide) - This FRIDAY @ The Chinatown Inn (PGH)

This should have been posted earlier.


---
CASS
London, UK - Sabotage / Industry 88

with guests:
Matt Monroe (SoulGlo, Dynamix Crew, InnerChild)

Philo (Night Vision)

Muse: Any of the nine daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus, each of whom 
presided over a different art or science; a guiding spirit; a source of 
inspiration; a poet - dictionary.com

This is perhaps one of the most daunting tasks that I have been asked to 
accomplish in some time. I have been presented with the challenge of 
introducing you, the audience, to one of the most influential DJ/producers 
that I have ever heard. To state that this man has been my guide - the 
epitome of all that I hold dear within this musical medium - would be akin 
to comparing my words to the poetic prose of Milton. In short, the parallel 
is crude.

In the world of the mundane, I could take the worn-torn path of the common 
man. I could dictate the facts that each could find on your own with little 
to no exertion. I can recite Cass statistics with the apathetic manner in 
which most are familiar: Cass was born in London in the year of 1973; he was 
exposed to a wide variety of music at an early age and made a name for 
himself in Sydney; has traveled the world over, and over again, exposing the 
masses to his twisted union of tech-house, progressive, and breaks; he has 
managed many record labels in his day including: Flying Rhino, FIRE, and 
Sabotage. But, alas, these facts offer little in the way sustenance, and 
will only leave you hollow inside, unfulfilled.

In exchange, I offer these raw, unsheltered, vehicles of emotion to convey 
my thoughts: dark, swank, queer, sensual, bent, primal, twisted, skewed, 
fucked, waylaid, insatiable, unconventional, alluring, tranquility, 
deviancy, foreboding, captivating, fixation, addiction, domination, 
submission, resurrection, ascension, validation. Perhaps their simplicity 
can persuade you to attend where my feeble rhetoric cannot. - firefan999

Looked into this a little more (yeah I should be busy packing, o well)...

At aardvark mastering, http://www.aardvarkmastering.com/dubs.htm , you
can get a 10" dub plate for $50 each, or a 12" dub plate for $65.  If
you just go mono you can get them for $40/$50 respectively.  Have no
idea on the quality of them, the name sounded familiar though.  In fact
I'm not sure if I've ever even seen a dub plate, just another little
interesting factoid in all of this.

Not tooting my own horn or anything, but I have a few here at the house 
that were given to me. The sound quality fades considering they're only 
playable (and I think) 40 times?... The ones I have sound pretty good 
still. I haven't pulled them out in a few years. I'd like to keep for as 
long as I can.

I can show them to yah sometime, if you'd like. =)

Yeah, I know they can't be played that much.  I wonder how long you can
play those plastic records that you can mold?  If you can play those a
100+ times, maybe it's worth it.  Not sure how the densities go.  Like
how durable acetate is compared to the liquid plastic they use in that mold.

Yeah him and David Tagg are doing some great things with thier
Expanding Electronic Diversity imprint.  Both really nice guys.  They
are into some doing some really cool improv performances mixing
acoustics, electronics, and turntables live on stage.

Definetly suggest checking out their label in depth.

I'm sure there's a way with max/msp/mspinky and all the various cycling74 tools.. you can scratch pretty much any time based media with it, or use it to manipulate whatever the hell else you want.  You could use the speed your scratching to control the filter cutoffs on your synth if you really wanted to....

do either of those programs mentioned let you play/manipulate
24bit/96khz wav files?

Hey fellow pb-cle'rs.  I don't post much because life is quite busy at the
moment, but anyhoo..
I thought I would let you know that I am playing on wrfl 88.1 (lexington,
ky) on thursday from 10 to 12 midnight.
It'll be some dnb of the funk variety.  You can tune in on the internet her=
e
--> http://wrfl.uky.edu:9000/listen.pls
Its a 128 k stream.

I guess that's about it.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

In:Verse [Mathmatics] | Touch | Wed 5.17.06

MATHMATICS
(Social Studies)
NYC

As a veteran DJ act, Mathematics is known for creating a unique vibe; 
blending soulfulness with dancefloor beats, making a wicked deep party 
atmosphere. Mathematics have recently launched their own imprint Social 
Studies distributed worldwide by Load Media.

Upcoming releases include the 12" Jazz b/w Sphinx (due out winter 2005) 
getting played by Fabio and DJ Flight among others. After that we will 
hear two singles themed Mathematical Tactics featuring collaborations 
between Maths and the Hungarian bad boys, Tactile. Also watch out for a 
collaboration with Mijatoho from Zurich.

While drum 'n' bass made in America has long been ignored by the largely 
UK-dominated scene, this talented duo has been heartily welcomed by the 
DJ fraternity in England, having had their music released on high 
profile labels such as Hospital, CIA, Defunked, Frontline, Renegade Rec. 
among others and played by the likes of LTJ Bukem, Bryan Gee, DJ Hype, 
Marcus Intalex, Total Science, High Contrast, DJ Lee, Nookie, London 
Elektricity, Blame, Calibre, L Double and Bailey, amongst others.

Worldwide support, both in and outside of drum 'n' bass, has come from 
DJ Marky, Patife and XRS from Brasil, Dieselboy, Dara, Juju and AK1200 
in the US, as well as eclectic heavyweights Les Gammas, Adam Goldstone, 
and Jason Bentley

Fri May 19                          CASS                         Pittsburgh

On Friday, May 19th, 2006, join SoulGlo, Night Vision and S.Simpson in 
welcoming Cass.

CASS
London, UK - Sabotage / Industry 88

with guests:
Matt Monroe (SoulGlo, Dynamix Crew, InnerChild)
Philo (Night Vision)

.Muse: Any of the nine daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus, each of whom 
presided over a different art or science; a guiding spirit; a source of 
inspiration; a poet. - dictionary.com

This is perhaps one of the most daunting tasks that I have been asked to 
accomplish in some time. I have been presented with the challenge of 
introducing you, the audience, to one of the most influential 
DJ/producers that I have ever heard. To state that this man has been my 
guide - the epitome of all that I hold dear within this musical medium - 
would be akin to comparing my words to the poetic prose of Milton. In 
short, the parallel is crude.

In the world of the mundane, I could take the worn-torn path of the 
common man. I could dictate the facts that each could find on your own 
with little to no exertion. I can recite Cass. statistics with the 
apathetic manner in which most are familiar: Cass was born in London in 
the year of 1973; he was exposed to a wide variety of music at an early 
age and made a name for himself in Sydney; has traveled the world over, 
and over again, exposing the masses to his twisted union of tech-house, 
progressive, and breaks; he has managed many record labels in his day 
including: Flying Rhino, FIRE, and Sabotage.. But, alas, these facts 
offer little in the way sustenance, and will only leave you hollow 
inside, unfulfilled.

In exchange, I offer these raw, unsheltered, vehicles of emotion to 
convey my thoughts: dark, swank, queer, sensual, bent, primal, twisted, 
skewed, fucked, waylaid, insatiable, unconventional, alluring, 
tranquility, deviancy, foreboding, captivating, fixation, addiction, 
domination, submission, resurrection, ascension, validation. Perhaps 
their simplicity can persuade you to attend where my feeble rhetoric 
cannot. - firefan999

alex bau - biography
 

alexs dj-sets, full of energy and devotion, turned dancefloors into 
total excess since 1992. his versatile selection of tracks, ranging from 
minimal to more hard edged technotracks, always develop a flow by 
keeping his very own but versatile style. The co-founder of toneman 
always gets people on his side until the last record has been played, 
mostly after several hours of extreme-partying

this approach to music is the result of a long career in the underground 
dance music industry, which began in the early 90's when spinning 
different kinds of dance music in his hometown and neighboring cities. 
in the very beginning, he recalls introducing early techno into his sets  
with moderate success, but he nevertheless dedicated his entire career 
to techno music. alex's musical aspirations have been inspired by 
composers such as roland orzabald (tear for fears), martin gore (depeche 
mode) and more ebm or 80ies synthiepop acts just to name a few.

in his sets, alex obeys to the old-school ethics of not just playing the 
hits but creating a story, even if he sometimes has to squeeze the whole 
set into a couple of hours. his experience as a radio- and club-resident 
dj from 1994 to 1996 and later on gigs throughout germany, austria, 
switzerland, czech republic, croatia, yugoslavia, hungary, poland, 
holland, canada or even romania or brasil has led him to win the hearts 
of an audience that is constantly growing in number. no matter what 
country on the world, booking alex means booking high quality, always 
grooving, sometimes minimal, sometimes hard techno that is brought to 
the audience by an artist with extraordinary solid skills on the decks 
paired with a huge amount of entertainment factor by the dj himself. 
this has also enabled him to apply his dance floor knowledge in the 
production studio where he creates potent club tracks with his partner 
and label mate sven dedek under monikers as basic implant, electric 
envoy and alex bau when these are his proper productions. Especially his 
first album .connected. was a clear statement by alex how .pure techno. 
looks like on his definition: versatile, entertaining, 
dancefloor-compatible and technically produced on the maximum level. no 
wonder that .connected. appears in the playlist of numerrous top-dj`s.

alex has released eps for fine audio, parasound, energy industries, 
rotation (dave angel's), toneman (his own), clr (chris liebing`s), 
pv-records (pascal feos), predicaments (justin berkovi`s) and default 
recordings. beside this he has remixed tracks for chris liebing and 
pascal feos. in addition to producing tracks for labels all around the 
globe, alex always consists on being recognized as a dj in a different 
kind of view beside the fact that of course his production style also 
reflects his musical preferences . pure techno, sometimes minimal, 
sometimes fat. in his eyes, the quality of a dj can not be measured with 
the number of releases.

Toronto-based producer and DJ Greg Gow, has long been a crowd favorite 
in Toronto.s electronic music scene.   As the founder of two 
internationally selling record labels, Restructured and Kombustion, Greg 
has fast become an ambassador for Canadian electronic music 
internationally. His rhythmical sensibility and technical talent has led 
Greg to join the ranks of premiere Canadian artists such as; DJ Preach, 
Misstress Barbara, John Acquaviva, Algorithm, Mateo Murphy and Richie 
Hawtin.

Early in his career Greg was exposed to various styles of music having 
attended warehouse events in Toronto and Detroit.  Initially, he 
collected hip hop records in the early nineties; but quickly gained 
recognition as a house music DJ on CHRY 105.5 FM York University radio.  
While Greg had established himself as a high-profile DJ in the Toronto 
house music circuit, his sound was rapidly evolving.  In 1996, 
influenced by the harder Detroit and German technological sounds, Greg 
traded his smooth house sound for dark atmospheric, intense and 
danceable techno. 

In 1997 the rave scene was exploding across Toronto, and it quickly 
became the ideal environment for Greg to display his hard rhythmic tones 
and technical brilliance.  Yet it was a fresh up-start techno production 
company, Phryl, where Greg.s stature of one of the top techno Djs in 
Canada was solidified.  Playing packed warehouses alongside 
international headliners such as; Adam Beyer, Joel Mull, Gaetano 
Parisio, Derrick May and Stacey Pullen.  His Phryl sets were regarded as 
brilliant and often overshadowed the top-billed acts he was playing 
with.  Greg was now a major player in the dance music scene in Toronto, 
and while the scene was shifting from warehouses to the more intimate 
club settings, he remained a staple in an ever-changing culture.

Greg Gow has enjoyed equal success as a promoter, DJ and Label Manager.  
Greg.s event production company Mono, was established in 2002 and is 
credited with bringing in some of the biggest names in Techno to 
Toronto.  Working with John Lickrish of Blue Bookings, Greg.s highly 
successful Mono events were hosted at various respected venues (System 
Soundbar, the Opera House and the Guvernment to name a few), bringing in 
talent such as; Richie Hawtin, Madga, Thomas Krome, Steve Bug and Speedy 
J. 

Greg.s DJ career was brought to the next level, when he signed with Blue 
Bookings.  This led to Greg.s well deserved association with other high 
caliber internationally touring DJs on the roster such as Marco Corola 
and Steve Bug.  He also had the opportunity to join Mauro Picotto on a 
mini tour, opening for him at Avalon  (formerly Limelight) in New York 
City and closing for Picotto in Toronto at the highly recognized 
Guvernment Nightclub, where Greg is frequently booked.  Presently, Greg 
holds down residencies at Toronto.s premiere electronic dance music 
destinations, System Soundbar, Comfort Zone and Film Lounge. 

Internationally, Greg has represented Toronto in Miami during the 2004 
Winter Music Conference at Privilege and this year at Space.  He has 
also played the legendary Detroit Movement Festival on the Techno Blvd. 
Stage, and was featured at the Tronic Treatment Party with Christian 
Smith in 2004. 

Ultimately it is Greg.s steady DJing career and his music productions 
that are leading to his ever-increasing recognition.  In the studio Greg 
combines analogue and digital equipment to compose banging climactic 
Detroit style techno that often features minor key stabs. His releases 
on labels including Seismic Detroit, Default, Zen, 2Wars and Tresor have 
garnered spins from top DJs Rush, Umek, and Mateo Murphy.

Greg.s own internationally selling labels; Restructured and Kombustion, 
feature his music and other artists. music from around the world.  
Restructured productions have been spotted in the crates of globe 
trotting DJs including Steve Rachmad and Ben Sims. In Chicago, Greg has 
played alongside DJ Frankie Vega and he is releasing tracks on Uppercut 
(a subsidiary of Dust Traxx). 

Greg has forthcoming releases including: the .Jack Theory EP. on Berrata 
Music (Detroit); .Eclipse. on Metapath; new tracks on Chris Liebing.s 
label Touchtone; and another on Omniscent (California). Restructured is 
releasing the .No Hockey EP. in Spring 2005 which features remixes of 
.Game 7. by fellow Canadians DJ Preach and Marco G.

Evidently, Greg Gow is a respected Canadian player in the game for the 
long-term with plans for 2005 and beyond. Music industry personages and 
fans can rest assured Greg Gow.s endeavors will live up to the calibre 
of excellence that he has thus far displayed.

All ages
Virgin venue!

Once again Tek-Know is proud to bring in some of the biggest talent in 
the techno scene for you listening enjoyment. We will be pulling out the 
stops for this one, brand new virgin venue, 20,000 watts of RMS goodness 
and more.

Andy Vaz - Background Records, [--] - Germany
Andy Vaz hails from Dsseldorf, Germany. Andy manages and curates 
Background Recordings. Andy has been a pinnacle cornerstone of the 
German electronic music movement. He is highly regarded as one of the 
essential individuals on the global front for providing a cultural 
conduit for electronic music, between Dsseldorf, San Francisco, 
Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, London, South Africa and countless other 
cities around the world. Background recordings has been a major force in 
the presentation of minimal techno, introducing and educating the world 
to the geographic variable influences that exist within the genre.

In 2000, Andy Vaz has released his own material. After many years of 
work in the studio, Andy was reluctant to release his music. taking the 
time needed to polish and refine the sound, and feel that it was on par 
with his contemporaries, his first 12", "Sounds Variation 1-1" was met 
with incredible international acclaim. Sounds_variation is based on the 
use of the same sounds, re-used throughout, giving each track another 
musical approach by pushing each instrument in a different compositional 
direction by re-arrangement, toneshifting and by adding/changing effects 
in order to demonstrate that a defined production criteria brings forth 
maximal results through the process of limitation within a lo-fi 
aesthetic. The first edition of the Andy Vaz vinyl series on the elusive 
and nameless label is therefore entitled [---].

NINJA'S of MINIMAL MADNESS: Jimi Tsang & Jason Allen
Mentor (Tsang) and apprentice (Allen) have combined their differences in 
music preference to deliver dance floors a ball of minimal wax that 
penetrates your left ear, melts your brain for 37 nanoseconds, then 
exits the right ear leaving you on the floor saying "holy eargasm 
batman!". Listen to the ninja's of minimal madness kick you in the ear 
with the bleeps, the sweeps and the creeps!

Tek-Know founder and beatman look for some original material randomly 
dispersed in his set on this special night

Chad Dolis - Restrukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland
Teacher by day of high thoughts and social concepts and teacher by night 
on how to throw down techno till your ears bleed this rising star has 
more skill in his middle finger than most cities could muster as a 
whole.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!

DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

There isn't going to be a Tronic this year.  Michelle and her partner are the ones who have been putting the detroit tronic together, and this year they are doing shift (the one with beyer, etc. etc. that looks like a tronic lineup...go figure).

Our current plans are to go up on Sunday night...we're probably going to substance (modeselektor, ben simms, smash tv, dan bell, etc. etc.) as we've seen nearly all the bigger names at shift within the last year or so.

and special guest:
[OUTPUT MESSAGE] - Live PA - Born in Queens, New York, in 1983, spending his 
formative middle-school years in New Jersey, and finally ending up in 
Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka
Outputmessage) can be given that rare title of "young musical prodigy." 
During
his time in New Jersey, he first became fascinated with a broad range of 
music,
eventually keying in on electronic; and when his family got its first 
computer
in the summer of 1998, he began making music on his own. Now, while a
mathematics graduate student at Virginia Tech, he spends his off time 
writing
tight, hook-laden tracks. Outputmessage debuted with a remix of Dabrye on 
the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a track ("Bernards 
Song") on Ghostly's Idol Tryouts
compilation before even turning 20. Later the Oneiros EP was released on 
Echelon
Productions. This year "Sommeil" was released on the Ghostly's Idol Tryouts 
Two
compilation and Outputmessage's debut LP, Nebulae, is set to drop this June 
on
Melodic.  Outputmessage was also recently selected to be in URB's Next 100.

Subject: {pb-cle} mathematics

sort of a last minute thing, wasn't planning to go, but bill was down 
for it so we skipped annabells and headed to touch.  touch is looking 
pretty good, minor remodeling and some rearranging, but nothing major.  
looks like they're keeping the kitchen open later now too?

mathematics was really really good.  i'd been told by the breakbeat nazi 
he was the hot shit, but i guess seeing is believing.

I'm going to be in Japan bitches!  (sorry just had to plug it one  
more time.  I like butt plugs, wait... err.... i mean... uhh.... just  
forget about it)

http://japan.vrillusions.com/

Looks like I'll be going to this place next saturday
http://www.visionquest-tokyo.com/vqdev/events_visionary.php

The place it's at is one of the biggest night clubs in Japan with a  
capacity of 2,700 people.  Was talking to a couple people about other  
places to go but haven't really heard much from them.  And by that  
next saturday we would have been to that area at one point already  
doing the tourist thing.  So just have to memorize how to get there  
from the hotel as I'm going to have to try and get there by myself  
and navigate public tranzit.   Or just pay for a cab. weee

Subject: {pb-cle} Memorial Day Party! - The Sycophant Slags (Mr. C + Francis Harris) PGH

For those of you keeping to Pittsburgh this weekend -

The Sunday before Memorial Day. This party is going to slam out of 
control... I hope a few of you can make it. If you're in the PGH area and 
need a presale I will be able to accommodate.


----
This is one hell of a combination... The Sycophant Slags are none other than 
London's Mr. C and New York's Francis Harris. Mr. C needs no introduction, 
one of the most influential, ever present forces on London's House scene, 
both on vinyl via releases on the Plink Plonk and End Recordings imprints 
and in the clubs as an international DJ and Co Owner of the much adored End 
Club.

Francis Harris (Adultnapper) is a key figure on the New York Club scene, 
co-promoting the legendary 'Overboard' night whilst running the excellent 
Matter/:Form label. Francis's former productions can be found on Surreal, 
Big Chief and End Recordings to name a few, with collaborators including 
Dave Mothersole, Adam Collins and Erich Lee.

Opening Guest:
Walter (SoulGlo, Exposure, Drop a Log)

Altar Bar
1620 Penn Ave (Strip District)
Pittsburgh, PA 15222

Doors open: 9:00pm // 21 and over
Admission: $15 presale // $20 door
Tickets: groovetickets.com Or Call: 877.87.GROOVE

Info Line: 412.248.SLAG .html

What a horrible night to have a curse.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Formerly the US's most popular techno group, Prototype 909 comes 
together for the first time since the late 90's for a VERY SPECIAL live 
performance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is a once in a lifetime chance to 
see p909 together one more time!!!!!!

The return of Prototype 909!!!  Famed NYC techno trio is back for more 
live improvisational acid!   Reforming for this select live show is the 
original lineup: Taylor Deupree (12k.com), Dietrich Schoenemann (Hidden 
Agenda, ToraToraTora) and Jason BPMF Szostek (Rancho Relaxo Allstars, 
Serotonin Records). All are still very active in the world of electronic 
music, but haven't been seen together since the late 90s.   Back then, 
they produced 3 studio albums, a live album and many singles of 
inovative and experimental techno.   But what they became best known for 
was their dynamic live performances which ran the gamit of styles and 
intensity.   Detroit knows there are alot of great live techno 
performers, but when these three get together behind a pile of analog 
synths and drum machines they become a 6 handed super freak that can 
take your mind body and soul to places you've never imagined possible.   
Always fun, always full of suprises and this one promises to be like no 
other!!


[NEIL LANDSTRUMM-LIVE]
-SCOTLAND
Scandanavia / Tresor / Peacefrog, Scotland, Full on Techno Live Pa !!!

Starting his professional career in 1994 Neil has released music on 
several international electronic labels and also worked in the motion 
graphics field with MTV, Rockstar Games and The Magnificents. To date 
Landstrumm has released 5 Experimental Electronic albums, 1 
Art-Rock-Blues-Beat album, several techno 12" singles and remixes on 
labels ranging from Peacefrog, Tresor, Sonic Groove Mosquito, to his own 
imprint, Scandinavia. Neil has collaborated with Cristian Vogel,
Si Begg, Mike Fellows, Bill Youngman and Tobias Schmidt the best know of 
which is Sugar Experiment Station.
He is native to Scotland but has recently spent years living in New York 
soaking up Brooklyn and Queens best in lifestyle, culture and music, but 
now has relocated back to his homeland.

2005 sees Neil at the head of a successful creative factory called 
Scandinavia producing and releasing music,
motion graphics and television Ids and a print-based clothes label. New 
and uncharted music territories are currently being navigated.

Essentially a live artist, Neil has built his reputation on 
uncompromising live performances world wide with shows most recently at 
Unit.Tokyo, Rex-Paris, Tresor-Berlin and Electrowerkz-London.

Bass-Tech beats, Grime, Electro-Techno, Broken-Beat, Miami bass, beat 
throw downs or dirty swing style-lets stop the pigeons with their holes 
and get on with the real deal.. Landstrumm creates his classic stomach 
pumping bass,
metallic and melodic clangs and odd funky percussive swing lines live 
and in full effect.

This isn't some laptop-noodle performance. It's live electronics at it's 
very best.

2000 small dogs couldn't be wrong.


[TONY ROHR- LIVE]
-BROOKLYN
Remains / Instinct / Hidden Agenda, Brooklyn, Nyc  Minimal / Techno / 
Hard Techno

Setting up shop in the beautiful borough of Brooklyn, Tony Rohr has had 
a steady output of atmospheric, yet dance floor friendly releases. 
Sometimes labeled "Voodoo Techno", his sound actually varies from 
release to release. Whether it is a tech-house classic like "Baile 
Conmigo", freaked out noise funk on the label Tonewrecker with Paul 
Birken, experimental chillout with group Carlito Verde, or a dubbed out 
techno stormer like "Yadda Yadda Yadda" his sound never quite gets 
pigeon holed.

DJing in the early 1990's his next step was that to producing in 1996 
and then progressively to Live PAs in 1997. He hasn't looked back to 
DJing since.

In 2002 Tony's releases landed him on various mix compilations by Adam 
Beyer, Surgeon, Supa DJ Dimitri,  Sven Vath & Richie Hawtin's 
compilation of Ibiza's "Sound of the Second Season" just to name a few.

Just recently in mid 2004, Tony joined the German based Cocoon family as 
one of their artists. "Dead Chewy" featured on the "D" compilation is 
still a favorite.

With releases on Macintosh, Hidden Agenda, Weave, Genau, Remains, 
Tonewrecker, and Cocoon but to name a few, Tony shows no sign of slowing 
down.


[ADAM X]
-BROOKLYN
Psycho Dynamics / Sonic Groove, Brooklyn, Nyc Hard Techno

In his DJ performances and track production, Adam X's sound is best 
described as hard, EBM and industrial inspired dance-floor techno & 
electro. Adam X penetrates, educates and infuses his audience with a 
real energy, often drawing from dark & sexual themes, through the 
mastery of the electronic music medium he has gained from a prolific 
career.

[DRUMCELL]
-EAST LA
DROID BEHAVIOR, EAST LA, CALIFORNIA, Techno / Hard Techno / Minimal / 
Idm

Founder of Droid Recordings and co-founder of Droid Behavior, Drumcell 
has been one of techno's greatest allies in Southern California in 
recent times. A graduate of the Musician's Institute and a long-time 
performer at parties around the region, Drumcell has been influenced by 
music from his earliest years. After being exposed to indoor and outdoor 
raves in the 90s, he grew addicted to the sounds of acid, industrial, 
techno and gabber. Soon after he had set up a live PA and established 
himself in Los Angeles as one of the major players in the techno scene.

Sunday, May 28, 2006
The Sycophant Slags
(Mr. C. & Francis Harris - Halcyon, Superfreq, The End, Made)

This is one hell of a combination... The Sycophant Slags are none other 
than London's Mr. C and New York's Francis Harris. Mr. C needs no 
introduction, one of the most influential, ever present forces on 
London's House scene, both on vinyl via releases on the Plink Plonk and 
End Recordings imprints and in the clubs as an international DJ and Co 
Owner of the much adored End Club.

Francis Harris (Adultnapper) is a key figure on the New York Club scene, 
co-promoting the legendary 'Overboard' night whilst running the 
excellent Matter/:Form label. Francis's former productions can be found 
on Surreal, Big Chief and End Recordings to name a few, with 
collaborators including Dave Mothersole, Adam Collins and Erich Lee.

On Saturday, June 3rd, 2006, The Ohio State University's South Oval host

Toronto-based producer and DJ Greg Gow, has long been a crowd favorite 
in Toronto.s electronic music scene.   As the founder of two 
internationally selling record labels, Restructured and Kombustion, Greg 
has fast become an ambassador for Canadian electronic music 
internationally. His rhythmical sensibility and technical talent has led 
Greg to join the ranks of premiere Canadian artists such as; DJ Preach, 
Misstress Barbara, John Acquaviva, Algorithm, Mateo Murphy and Richie 
Hawtin.

Early in his career Greg was exposed to various styles of music having 
attended warehouse events in Toronto and Detroit.  Initially, he 
collected hip hop records in the early nineties; but quickly gained 
recognition as a house music DJ on CHRY 105.5 FM York University radio.  
While Greg had established himself as a high-profile DJ in the Toronto 
house music circuit, his sound was rapidly evolving.  In 1996, 
influenced by the harder Detroit and German technological sounds, Greg 
traded his smooth house sound for dark atmospheric, intense and 
danceable techno. 

In 1997 the rave scene was exploding across Toronto, and it quickly 
became the ideal environment for Greg to display his hard rhythmic tones 
and technical brilliance.  Yet it was a fresh up-start techno production 
company, Phryl, where Greg.s stature of one of the top techno Djs in 
Canada was solidified.  Playing packed warehouses alongside 
international headliners such as; Adam Beyer, Joel Mull, Gaetano 
Parisio, Derrick May and Stacey Pullen.  His Phryl sets were regarded as 
brilliant and often overshadowed the top-billed acts he was playing 
with.  Greg was now a major player in the dance music scene in Toronto, 
and while the scene was shifting from warehouses to the more intimate 
club settings, he remained a staple in an ever-changing culture.

Greg Gow has enjoyed equal success as a promoter, DJ and Label Manager.  
Greg.s event production company Mono, was established in 2002 and is 
credited with bringing in some of the biggest names in Techno to 
Toronto.  Working with John Lickrish of Blue Bookings, Greg.s highly 
successful Mono events were hosted at various respected venues (System 
Soundbar, the Opera House and the Guvernment to name a few), bringing in 
talent such as; Richie Hawtin, Madga, Thomas Krome, Steve Bug and Speedy 
J. 

Greg.s DJ career was brought to the next level, when he signed with Blue 
Bookings.  This led to Greg.s well deserved association with other high 
caliber internationally touring DJs on the roster such as Marco Corola 
and Steve Bug.  He also had the opportunity to join Mauro Picotto on a 
mini tour, opening for him at Avalon  (formerly Limelight) in New York 
City and closing for Picotto in Toronto at the highly recognized 
Guvernment Nightclub, where Greg is frequently booked.  Presently, Greg 
holds down residencies at Toronto.s premiere electronic dance music 
destinations, System Soundbar, Comfort Zone and Film Lounge. 

Internationally, Greg has represented Toronto in Miami during the 2004 
Winter Music Conference at Privilege and this year at Space.  He has 
also played the legendary Detroit Movement Festival on the Techno Blvd. 
Stage, and was featured at the Tronic Treatment Party with Christian 
Smith in 2004. 

Ultimately it is Greg.s steady DJing career and his music productions 
that are leading to his ever-increasing recognition.  In the studio Greg 
combines analogue and digital equipment to compose banging climactic 
Detroit style techno that often features minor key stabs. His releases 
on labels including Seismic Detroit, Default, Zen, 2Wars and Tresor have 
garnered spins from top DJs Rush, Umek, and Mateo Murphy.

Greg.s own internationally selling labels; Restructured and Kombustion, 
feature his music and other artists. music from around the world.  
Restructured productions have been spotted in the crates of globe 
trotting DJs including Steve Rachmad and Ben Sims. In Chicago, Greg has 
played alongside DJ Frankie Vega and he is releasing tracks on Uppercut 
(a subsidiary of Dust Traxx). 

Greg has forthcoming releases including: the .Jack Theory EP. on Berrata 
Music (Detroit); .Eclipse. on Metapath; new tracks on Chris Liebing.s 
label Touchtone; and another on Omniscent (California). Restructured is 
releasing the .No Hockey EP. in Spring 2005 which features remixes of 
.Game 7. by fellow Canadians DJ Preach and Marco G.

Evidently, Greg Gow is a respected Canadian player in the game for the 
long-term with plans for 2005 and beyond. Music industry personages and 
fans can rest assured Greg Gow.s endeavors will live up to the calibre 
of excellence that he has thus far displayed.

Andy Vaz - Background Records, [--] - Germany
Andy Vaz hails from Dsseldorf, Germany. Andy manages and curates 
Background Recordings. Andy has been a pinnacle cornerstone of the 
German electronic music movement. He is highly regarded as one of the 
essential individuals on the global front for providing a cultural 
conduit for electronic music, between Dsseldorf, San Francisco, 
Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, London, South Africa and countless other 
cities around the world. Background recordings has been a major force in 
the presentation of minimal techno, introducing and educating the world 
to the geographic variable influences that exist within the genre.

In 2000, Andy Vaz has released his own material. After many years of 
work in the studio, Andy was reluctant to release his music. taking the 
time needed to polish and refine the sound, and feel that it was on par 
with his contemporaries, his first 12", "Sounds Variation 1-1" was met 
with incredible international acclaim. Sounds_variation is based on the 
use of the same sounds, re-used throughout, giving each track another 
musical approach by pushing each instrument in a different compositional 
direction by re-arrangement, toneshifting and by adding/changing effects 
in order to demonstrate that a defined production criteria brings forth 
maximal results through the process of limitation within a lo-fi 
aesthetic. The first edition of the Andy Vaz vinyl series on the elusive 
and nameless label is therefore entitled [---].

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).



John B
http://www.beta-recordings.co.uk/

John B
Beta Recordings, MMI
UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB
http://www.spreeandadb.com/
DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

[INTERGALACTIC FAERIE FUNK] - 11pm to 1am - Live House Music Performance
i.f.f. have released 3 full length albums through their own label (je suis 
galactique) to sell at their high energy live shows. they have found 
themselves headlining festivals in toronto, edmonton, and nova scotia. they 
have played all over the sunny state of california, the rainy city of 
pittsburgh, dirty philadelphia, and magical new orleans. big cities like san 
francisco, los angeles, toronto, and new york as well as smaller towns like 
nashville, hattiesburg and charleston were visited by i.f.f. on many of 
their 2 to 3 month long tours. just recently, with the release of the ottawa 
12" single on robbaudio and the upcoming release of a four song vinyl ep, 
things have come full circle. intergalactic faerie funk has returned to it's 
signature style of electronic house music based on strange tones & textures; 
as well as finding a return to the 'live pa' started by marc hug - although 
this time he is armed with a laptop, effects box, controller, & ableton 
live. www.galactique.net - Brooklyn, NY

The I.F.F. will also be performing at a show I put together on Friday May 
26th at The Quiet Storm as their other indie electronica band incarnation 
[MOSSYROCK].  They will perform with the space rock band [Aydin] and the 
indie hip hop gorup [DRAULIC] aka [JACK WILSON and HEF STATIC].

[Next week]: The Passing of the Torch, The Changing of the Guard .... 
Brother Mike and I say goodbye to our Thursday Nights as we welcome Angelus 
as the new Resident DJ and Promoter.
[BROTHER MIKE] vs. [ANGELUS] - House music vs. Mash Up mixing all night 
long.

So after 6 long years, our house and techno night, Thursdays@Havana, will be 
moving to Saturday nights. Just trying to shake things up a bit.  The new 
night will be appropriatly called MOVED.  We'll be kicking it off on 
Saturday June 3rd with [DJ MIKEBEE] from San Fran, CA.  Our WHISKEY TANGO 
mashup night will then be taking the Thursday slot at the club starting June 
15th ... and Tuesdays will now be the host to a new night of progressive 
house and breaks music called IDENTITY CRISIS manned by Paul Fleetwood, Matt 
Monroe and their crew of deviants.

and special guest:
[OUTPUT MESSAGE] - Live Techno Performance - Born in Queens, New York, in 
1983, spending his formative middle-school years in New Jersey, and finally 
ending up in Richmond, VA, Bernard Farley (aka Outputmessage) can be given 
that rare title of "young musical prodigy." During his time in New Jersey, 
he first became fascinated with a broad range of music, eventually keying in 
on electronic; and when his family got its first computer in the summer of 
1998, he began making music on his own. Now, while a mathematics graduate 
student at Virginia Tech, he spends his off time writing
tight, hook-laden tracks. Outputmessage debuted with a remix of Dabrye on 
the Payback 12", alongside the esteemed Prefuse 73, and a track ("Bernards 
Song") on Ghostly's Idol Tryouts
compilation before even turning 20. Later the Oneiros EP was released on 
Echelon Productions. This year "Sommeil" was released on the Ghostly's Idol 
Tryouts Two compilation and Outputmessage's debut LP, Nebulae, is set to 
drop this June on Melodic.
Outputmessage was also recently selected to be in URB's Next 100.

Subject: {pb-cle} tonight@thequietstorm

Introducing Space Hop.

3 bands for $5

Quiet Storm
5430 Penn Avenue

9pm / BYOB ($2 corking fee) / All Ages

[AYDIN] - Post-shoegazer psychedelic rock with elements of prog, this indie 
power trio features lead accordion, plenty of E-bow and no bassist - Pgh, PA
www.aydin-music.com

[MOSSYROCK] - play what can be vaguely described as electronic indie rock. 
by combining laptops, guitar, mandolin, haunting cello, vocals and naughty, 
broken beats, they create glistening pop loop gems that leave you feeling 
part of a woozy, lilting waltz . Brooklyn, NY
www.mossyrock.net

[DRAULIC] - Indie Hip hop power duo featuring Jack Wilson and Hef Static. 
Pgh, PA www.myspace.com/draulic
(B.S.P. - Jack Wilson will be performing 2 songs that I produced for him, 
one of them also featuring Laren from Lushwell on vocals)

The holiday weekend starts tonight, stop on out!
Peace,
Jason C.

I'm not going, but that's because I'm Japan suckas!  Although I  
backed out on going to a party tonight.  Just way too exhausted from  
the day and we have a couple hour trip on a bullet train tomorrow.

safe in detroit.   hahahhahaha

(pictures aren't up for the weekend yet, but will be soon)

*paxahau - on their fucking game, i hope the rumour i heard of them 
organizing the next 2 demfs is true?  (anyone confirm?)
*prototype 909 - fucking amazing, the 3rd best set i've ever seen, after 
hardfloor and hardfloor.  and everyone knows hardfloor is god, so 
topping god would be pretty hard??
*acid junkies - yowza. i'd heard a little of their stuff before seeing 
them, but whoaaaahhhh i was not ready for that shit.  acid junkies indeed.
*woody mcbride live - knows how to rock a crowd.  after he'd bring in 
some sick shit and the crowd would go nuts, the smile on his face would 
go ear to ear.
*neil landstrumm live, twice - quirky weird and good as ever.  we did 
manage to miss the first part of his set both times though  :(
*richard divine - rocking out with a devilfish, playing hardcore and all 
shades of crazy ass shit on the industrial stage.  how crazy you ask?  
it drove one guy to the point of self mutilation and ended up leaving in 
a wheelchair.  seriously. (i'm sure more was involved and richard 
divines crazy music just set him off, but of course that would only be 
speculation)
*tony rohr - i didn't think anyone could follow prototype 909s set, but 
this guy i never heard of before made me take that back.
*nitzer ebb - hell yeah, seeing a crowd rock out like that to these guys
*richie hawtin - i still dont get the whole "church of richie" thing, 
yeah i caught maybe the first 10 minutes and last 10 minutes, definately 
nothing special, but the industrial stage had so much better music on at 
the time.  at first i'd have much rather just left after nitzer ebb, but 
stacy wanted to see richie real bad.  in the end it was all good because 
richard divine kicked ass
*industrial in general at demf - hope they have more next year
*kill memory crash - sweeeettttttt
*columbine - i caught maybe 2 minutes before they were done and holy 
shit was that shit intense. evil noisy industrial stuff
(and here goes my big huge rant that drove me fucking nuts all weekend)
*adam x - not really sure why promoters book him (if you are a promoter 
that has booked him in the past, please drop me a private email and let 
me know why you did, just curious) .  in the past he has cleared and 
killed the dancefloor almost every time i've seen him (actually every 
time except one).  well this weekend he's taken it to a new level. at 
old school 2, he screwed around with the mixer or something then got 
into a fight with the soundguy, someone said it might have gotten 
physical, some shouting was going back and forth.  i wanted to get out 
of there even before that, but it took me awhile to convince bill that 
sticking around for his set would be a drag.  i don't know if he ever 
did go on--people left--party killed...  totally random, and i'm sure 
not his fault, but he came on the stage during regis and functions set 
and voila! no sound for 20 minutes.  industrial stage, again totally 
random and not his fault, but he was up front during one set as it ended 
and bam!  5 minutes of silence.  so 3 of the big gaps of silence this 
weekend adam X was around (yes, he wasn't spinning during 2 of them, but 
come on, this guy has got to be cursed).   promoters, *P*L*E*A*S*E*, in 
the name of the dance floor, *P*L*E*A*S*E* stop booking adam x.  it only 
shows me that you either dont know what you're booking, or that you are 
playing some sick joke on ravers.  i guess an exception to this is if 
you dont put him on prime time peak dancing time or in a second room or 
something.

anyhow, a huge tip of the hat and mad props to paxahau and all of the 
other promoters involved with demf.  shit was so good this year, i'll 
even overlook paxahau booking adam x.

props to local 313/panic for endzone, i'll also forgive their intensely 
bad judgement on booking adam x for a one room party, because P909, 
landstrumm, and tony rohr fucking killed detroit.  had you stuck him in 
between those guys instead of after them i might not have forgiven you.

detroit collective/dark course - hooking up a ghettotabulous venue with 
kick ass music and the industrial dungeon basement.  missed chemlab 
there, but i couldn't pull myself away from the acid junkies.... and 
chemlab was playing monday at demf, though in retrospect would have been 
cool to see them in that dungeon at that hotel.

Damn!  Sounds like a blast!  Hopefully next years will be just a good
and I can make it.  Sad @ missing Richard Devine.

I did yard work, dug a garden, took the family swimming, and worked in
the studio.  Trying to scrounge together gas money to hit Modeselektor
@ Grog Shop tonight.  Thats going to be a great show.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} So who is giong to DEMF Anyway?

Last weekend I went to the sony showroom, by myself without my cousin  
with me.  went to akihabara, rode a bullet train, drooled at japanese  
cosplayers and went to a couple shrines.  Weee japan.  Never did end  
up going to a party though, unfortunately never got enough time.   
That's for next time, so who's going with me :)

And as far as pictures go... yeah... today was the closest I've ever  
gotten to filling my 1 gig card, and it was 368 pictures or so... in  
one day :)  And all the beer here tastes like budweiser, but worse.   
Sucks I missed DEMF, if they have a lineup like this next year I'll  
be sure to go.

:i: love japan

OK next year I'm taking vacation days and staying the whole weekend, that
was too much fun for just a short visit.  I had a really good time and it
was nice to see everyone.  I know I should have stayed until the end, but I
had school & work early on Tuesday.

review:
My only complaint is that I wish they didn't shove the dnb down in the
underground stage.  It was so hot and smelled like and old gym sock.  The
sound was so loud but very garbled: could have been me, but I thought the
sound could have been much better.  Anyway, I couldn't take the heat down
there so I only cought parts of the dnb sets; one of the main reasons I
went.

-orb:  It was good to hear, like an old friend, thats probably the 5th time
I've seen Paterson.  Not the same as seeing ORB up close in a lmited venue.

-acid junkies: God damn!  Now thats 4 to the floor I can get into.  The
sound at the club was killer.  Those kicks felt like getting punched in the
cheast, and it was so clear at those loud levels.  That club was so hard to
find though - I'm taking cabs next year.

-industrial stuf:  I also think thats a great idea, unfortunately I didn't
remeber to check it out at this one.  Hey anything that brings in hot goth
chicks is cool in my book.

I think its really big of detroit to welcome electronic music as much as
they do.  I hope the money it brings in helps the city; as rough as it is -
it really is a pretty nice place.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} So who is giong to DEMF Anyway?

Good Sets: Donald Glaude, played some fun stuff and had a good time with 
it even though he was on real early before people showed up. Tortured 
Soul was nice, even though the emo lyrics really started to ge annoying 
after a bit. Whatever was in the tent near the river all day monday was 
great to relax to.

I was really looking forward to hearing DnB and some good House at the 
underground stage, but the sound was so shitty that I couldn't stay. It 
was too hot, too loud, and the sweaty women and warm beer really turned 
me off. Here's an idea, why not move it into that courtyard that is at 
the far corner of the plaza next time.

The St. Regis hotel is my new headquarters every time I go, since it is 
easy to get a room, and it is super swank.

The food vending was really limited this year, I was really looking 
forward to getting some lamb curry that I've been eating for the last 
two years, but had to settle for shawarma instead, bring it back (the 
Indian food).

Overall, i'm gonna call this the best one yet, and hopefully they outdo 
themselves next year.

he was decent. i've heard him do better, but yeah, it was real early.

<<Tortured Soul was nice, even though the emo lyrics really started to

i was underwhelmed. i think these guys out of toronto are better:

i saw kimek (2pm-4pm) for a minute and was non-plussed.

<<I was really looking forward to hearing DnB and some good House at

agreed. it was torturous, unless you were dead-center of the
'dancefloor', and even then, the highs were muddy at best.

Had a blast this weekend... the highlights for me were:

Jeremy Ellis (Ayro) - his afternoon performance on saturday in the tent was
good, but his performance that night at the brokefunk freestyle afterparty
was DOPE.  I took some video, on youtube.com search for ayro and my videos
will come up.

Tortured Soul was ok, i thought their performance 2 years ago was better.

Went to see Norm Talley at his regular beatdown night sunday, best vibe of
the weekend was in that venue (Porter Street)

the Orb was prettty cool, but not tear the roof off by any stretch.

Louie Vega played a very impressive set, at the point in the day when it was
so damn hot and hard to dance, but he definitely made people move.

Carl Craig played some good house, but totally acted like he didnt want to
be there, walking away from the decks to talk to people and not putting very
much effort into enhancing his set - but it was good music and well mixed,
so i can't complain too much about him being a pompous ass.

Nitzer Ebb was pretty impressive, i enjoyed their performance thoroughly, as
it really added the change of pace.

Greyboy was the best way to end the weekend on Monday night, playing that
funk n soul till 4am (2nd best vibe, at the Buzz Bar)

overall, i think paxahau was a little heavy on the minimal - i love me some
minimal, but i heard quite a bit of _boring_ minimal this weekend.  I would
have liked to see more groups like Fat Freddy's Drop, Platinum Pied Pipers,
etc that stretch the diversity of the festival.

my disappointment of the weekend was Krikor, he had some bright spots, but
most of the time, i felt slightly bored.

i forgot one other good performance that needed noted.  mathew johnson at
the preparty on friday night was very cool.  started off with some really
good minimal stuff for about 35-40 minutes, then drifted in the middle for
about 15-20 minutes of less than moving stuff, but then really ended up
strong for the last 45 minutes and was well worth the 10 bucks - the venue
had some pretty killer sound too, i just didnt care for the 4 dollar water's
and the 4 dollar bud lights.

prototype 909.  what can I say.   at the sat night afterparty End 
Zone.  Luckily, the richie hawtin show that night kept the club we 
went to filled with ONLY techno snobs like myself, trout (maybe bill, 
not sure how snobby you are though) and a gorgeous 6' blonde model 
from slovakia.

the lighting was strictly provided by bright worklights across the 
street silhouetting everything on the stage into the quite swank 
nightclub.  very suited, minimal lighting.  THere was a laser too, 
but it wasn't doing much.

Neil Landstrumm played an awesome set, but once Prototype 909 came 
on, I all but forgot about him.  I'm a HUGE fan of the acid sound, 
and there was not a minute in their set that I did not think that 
they were the gods of acid.  It was simply amazing.  To the point 
where I would say that it was the best set that i've ever heard, 
EVER, anywhere by a factor of 10.  and remember where i've been 
(europe, tresor in berlin, the UK, Toronto, etc).

Jaded? Who's jaded?

wow.....

prototype 909 are the gods of techno..... I hope they put out some 
new stuff soon.  I'm tempted to drive to philly tonight to see them 
again.  but reality interferes

the set was so good that I can't remember much of the rest of the 
weekend.   Adam beyer kept me (yes, me) dancing long past when I 
could barely walk, but that was to be expected.   :P

yeah, i was walking across hart plaza and heard this hideous scratching 
leading into a trainwrecky sort of thing and didn't even have to look 
and i knew it was donald glaude, i guess you can say his mixing is 
"distinct".  there, i'm trying to be positive about things.
