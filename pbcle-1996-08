this is sugar bear but i changed my nickname, now i'm elias. this is
why my name + signature are different. it's a long story--even i don't
understand it so i can't explain. sorry to cause mass confusion +
general chaos. anyway i sent a message to the list a while ago (it was
really long too but i'm not going to retype it), but it didn't go thru
+ didn't end up in the directory where the messages that somehow don't
get sent go. it just disappeared. *twilight zone music* so i hope this
goes to the list. by the way i decided to be realistic + honest with
the signature: that's me + yes i can ollie that high, tho it's not 
particularly impressive. but if i would have made a picture of me
switchstance fakie 180 varial double kickflipping onto a cop car (now 
that would be cool, but i definitely can not do a trick like that!) it
would be entirely unrealistic.

No, not trippin' on the road.  Getting in a vehicle (RV's RULE!) and
heading out on the road to *the* party.
Everyone knows that all roads lead to Detroit, and all roads this
weekend will lead to Sickness.......Recovery.....

Admittedly Detroit is just a little far for some people to drive, but
when the bill is Matthew Hawtin then Jeff Mills then Richie Hawtin and
the *AFTERPARTY* is Eric Haupt, John Acquaviva, Clark Warner, and
Matthew Hawtin again, well, they will come (someone has been watching
too much Field of Dreams).

But what about people who just can't make it? Well, Plus 8 has teamed up
with BeatBox (www.beatbox.com) in the US and Teleparc (www.teleparc.com)
in Japan, for a RealAudio broadcast of this event to anyone who can't
make it.

If you don't have RealAudio yet, then you should get it.  Nothing could
be easier.  Here are the simple steps for obtaining the RealAudio Player
so you can tune in:
- Go to http://www.realaudio.com
- Choose the [Get RealAudio Player 2.0] link
- Answer a couple questions (like email address, kind of computer...)
- Click the [Download RealAudio 2.0 Player Now] link (easy so far)
- Wait while RealAudio downloads
- When it's done, double-click the file that just downloaded on you
computer, answer a couple questions, choose [Express Setup] and you're
done.

You may be wondering what these DJ's are like.  Matthew Hawtin is the
consumate ambient DJ, his collection is from all parts of the globe, if
you're looking to hear ambient you never knew existed, then Matt's the
one.  Then there's Jeff Mills, the best DJ on earth.  Pounding and
uncompromising, once you hear Jeff playing, you will sell your soul to
be there.  Richie Hawtin will be closing out the Sickness....... portion
of the party (Recovery will not be broadcast).  If Jeff is the best,
then Richie is tied for second with Derrick May.  Richie's style and
track selection have earned him a following bordering on fanatical, and
with good reason; his set will take you and your mind to places only you
can go.

It's Thursday now, the party is on Saturday, the sound arrives on Friday
from 600 miles away (only the best and biggest sound will do) and we
have to start setting up.

If you need some help or info about getting RealAudio then mail me, or
if you would like more informationg about the event then check:
http://www.plus8.com/sickness

Thanks, and if we don't see you there, then hopefully we'll see you hit
the RealAudio server.

what's up everyone, this is d.CYPOL on a mission to advertise.  I 
just recently produced my first (professional) happy hardcore demo.  
Unfortunately it was a bit expensive getting these buggers taken care 
of (DAT recording, colored covers, and high quality tapes) so the 
price is going to be about 8 bucks.  But I put alot of time and 
effort into them so they are sure to please.  The first side is a 37 
minute mix of the most explosive tracks I own (to ensure a promised 
eargasm) ;and the second side consists of a 38 minute jazz influenced 
jungle mix (good for groovin, chillin, and long car trips).  Anyways, 
it should be easy for people with all different tastes to enjoy it....
If you want to get ahold of one get in touch with me over the 
computer network, at Your 2nd ago next tuesday, or da jive turkeys 
next outlaw.

Subject: 	RE: the IO3 and SETI connection and my opinion

I would like to shout out my opinion as a human being, not as a sound guy or 
whatever.

I spend 7 years in college. what did I learn ? That I know just a very small 
amount compare to what can be learned. Knowledge to me, has no price. you can 
not buy knowledge...there is so much to learn about everything and not enough 
time to learn. I learn new things everyday. I spend hours every day cruising 
the net, watching TLC or the discovery channel to learn new things (because I 
hate reading books). I am starting to think that the more knowledge I acquire, 

the less I actually know about our world because my awarness increases which 
leads to a higher demand for knowledge. Do I make sense ?

A PhD is coming out at IO ver 3.0 Beta to talk about the possiblity of life 
out there in our ever expanding space. That is another chance for me to 
acquire knowledge, to obtain more information about our surrounding. I am an 
Industrial Eng. I like everything that is touched by technology. 

Last year, JJ brought us Yogies. Some people were laughing about them, but 
some learned to discover peace within ourself, discover how to relax, unwine 
our spirit. I use to practice Yoga many years ago....it made me a calmer 
person. Because of Yoga, I have never lost my patience, I have never been in a 

physical fight. IO is a different event...it is not just a rave...it is a 
learning experience...why pass on it. We care learn from each other.

At IO, I donate my time and my system. At IO2, I made (I think) the largest 
donation ($14000). This year, I doing even more.....I am putting my damm E-2 
Visa on the line (too long to explain). Why I am doing all this work ? Because 

I believe in the music, it has a powerfull message (it is up to you to 
discover it). We had music (rythms and sound) before we had language. Music, 
no matter what kind, is the root of our civilisation. 

And why donate money to SETI ? Why not give the money to homeless or aids 
or.....
We could donate the money to a million different thing. Homeless people is 
IMHO the last of my choices. I have seen to many homeless people make $40 an 
hour beging for money. Most of the homeless people, in my opinion, ended up 
there by choice. They did not have the will to do what it takes to take care 
of themselves. Talk to homeless people, listen to their stories. and you will 
see. some homeless ended up their because of our system. I will help those 
people. I will not give money, but I will give them food or talk to them to 
convince them to find the energy and will inside to get out. I gave some 
homeless people their life back or a chance to make it back. But when I see a 
guy drunk on the side of the road....I see he has no will or intention to get 
back on track. but when I see someone asking for a job, even to take out trash 

or whatever, I will try to help him. Have you ever noticed that most of the 
homeless are male...why because female have more will and will fight harder so 

survive.

This was just my opinion as a human being. Flame me if you wish..I don't care, 

but if you have a constructive critisism to make, I would be more than happy 
to read it.

I think we do stand for something different, but simply something
different than the rest of the world, or different from mainstream
society; of whom I wouldn't expect too many pennies sent to do something
for someone.

I'm sorry my point at being laughed at was emphasized.  I didn't mean this
to be so.  It sort of slipped in there during my angst-ridden response
to this whole issue.

Oh...   and, yes, I know that IO last year was IO2, not three (cough).

No, you're not just lucky.  We do have a lot of interesting, caring and
cool people here.  Again, sorry if I implied otherwise.

But simply doing something different for the sake of being different seems
silly to me.  Last year's experience of the yogis and Kundalini was something
that had to be experiential; you had to be there to experience it.  Simply
reading about Kundalini and yogic practice doesn't cut it.  But, to learn 
about SETI's work and how to get money to them can be done by reading.
I'm not trying to say, don't hire people to come and speak, but don't make
the entire emphasis of the event giving money to SETI.

Also, how will learning about alien tech. give us the possibility to enlighten
and/or change our lives?  From what I've been reading not a whole lot has
come across the SETI screens.  If I'm incorrect, correct me.

Housing/feeding the homeless isn't actually done as much as you think it
is.  If it was, there wouldn't any longer be anyone living in the streets,
but I shouldn't have to tell anyone that.  If giving something (money)
to someone who really needs it (not a scientific group) is no longer wrapped
up by what we are all about, then maybe *I'm* in the wrong boat.

Here's my next question:

	What will change people's lives for the better and allow them
	to stretch their boundaries, learning about SETI's work on
	looking for alien technology or dropping a few bucks in the
	bucket for an organization trying to keep said people from starving
	to death?  It's difficult to learn about alien technology
	while your stomach is painfully empty.

Yes, I am trying to pull on your heart strings a bit, but with good
cause.  I'm simply trying to keep things in perspective.

Just a quick note-- I will not be able to make it to steel city jungle on

hey, me again, from wpts, 92.1 pgh.  I'm shy but proud to announce that I 
think i have the courage to invite you all to listen to my show next 
Thursday afternoon from 2-4, possibly until 6 if the next guy doesn't 
come in.  My mixing skills aren't that great, but I have some decent tunes
and I have some ideas.  I have a monty python record and i'm not afraid 
to use it!  so if you're sitting around and you're w/in range, choon in 
and get ready to go, "Oooh!  I like this song!  Oooh, but she really fucked 
that up..."

ta for now

>PBS, NPR (National Public Radio), and the arts are facing major cutbacks

>Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations commitees each have 13
>subcommitees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies.  Each

As always, Interstellar will be as inexpensive as possible.  Tickets will be 
$15 before aug. 1st, $17 until aug 15th and $20 at the door. This might seem 
lame to us, but we have chosen to throw down for a particularly plush 
location. This will provide full facilities for the weekend, camping, 
security, insurance, medical tent, We hope you appreciate a safe, happy 
campground with showers in real buildings, swimming pool as well as a rain 
protected stage in a huge meadow within the woods.  

This place is absolutely unbelievable, boasting running water and electricity 
for most of the campsites, natural trails, an onsite store, and numerous other 
amenities to make the weekend as enjoyable as possible. An event on any scale 
has to be done in a realistic manner and we hope our true intentions are 
clear.

Interstellar Outback will also be making a major contribution ot the SETI 
Institute. On Saturday, Dr. Seth Shostak of the SETI institute will deliver a 
presentation on the current state of affairs in the Seach for ExtraTerrestrial 
Intelligence. The SETI institute is home to the largest coordinated search for 
life in the universe. They sponsor numerous research projects aimed at 
determining if life exists elsewhere. The largest of these programs is Project 
Phoenix; the targeted radio survey of nearby stars.  It is this program that 
your Interstellar Outback admission will be supporting.

Tickets are available now by mail order. Send money order to (made out to 
Maxximum SL) :
Maxximum Sound and Lights
c/o IO3 tickets
2124 Sherwood Avenue, Suite 2
Louisville KY 40205
If we receive your order after the 12 of August , it will be too late to send 
your tickets back. So we will keep them at the gate for you. (Will call) Don't 
forget to include your return address. If you live around Louisville, you can 
get them at Better Days records (basement) on Bardstown road.

We would like to thank everyone who contributed to the IO experience.  People 
deserving thanks are too numerous to list, but a few have gone above and 
beyond and deserve additional recognition for their efforts.  So we give extra 
special shouts out to Drop Bass for years of support and bringing their sound 
system, Antares for promotion efforts, Optimystiq for their beautifull 
visuals, Maxximum for providing all the wonderful gear for the mainstage, and 
of course, JJ who got this whole crazy thing started. And the rest of you: 
you know who you are.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

Golden Joy	Sat aug 3, 1996		Pittsburgh, pa
When we first got involved in this scene we were awed by many things.  
The most memorable was the sheer energy and excitement of going to a new 
space, hearing sick DJs and the feeling of a massive sound system moving 
your body.  These are the things that we kept in mind while panning this 
event.  We invite you to come and hear some of the best DJ talen in the 
US and groove to one of the most musically complete line-ups Pittsburgh 
has ever seen on one of the best sound systems ever brought here.  this 
party isn't for egos, names or glory... this party is for you to end your 
summer properly.  Peace.

This was paisted from the back of the color IO3 flier. This text was written 
by JJ, founder and mentor of the Interstellar Outback Events

Sometimes you just have to grab a moment and say- now, this is it, I'm going 
to have a hell of a good time, right now, tonight, here. Go for it. You can 
clear a lot of junk out of your head and focus. You can change your life in 
some small way. Energized, inspired, regardless of what you call the state, it 
s worth pursuing. Being social animals and all, it sometimes seems easier to 
get transported by the moment if there are other people around doing the same 
thing. For that matter, a little music and dancing can help, too. In certain 
circles, this is referred to as a vibe. You'd think we'd come up with another 
word after a few years. But it'll have to do, like everything else. There's no 
such thing as a perfect weekend, just an intense one. Sometimes, though, on 
the drive home, you find that's it's worth it, even all the crazy stuff we go 
through to get to a good one. But what we do, all of us annoying and stressed 
out promoters, none of that is what makes a party good.
	That particular part is up to you. What makes a gathering a powerful 
experience is the willingness of the participants to lower defenses, meet new 
humans, and interact on a level not easily found in the bulk of society. This 
activity draws us out of our various cities and unites us, a temporary, mobile 
community; forming, dissolving, activating, exploring. You know, a quick 
transcendental bite, not available in any store. I mean, step back and take a 
look at your everyday environment. Communication systems bombard us with 
messages based mostly on consumption, authority, and marketed sedation. 
Historians will think we're a bunch of dorks. It's easy to forget that behind 
every pair of eyes is the same kind of being. Most of the time we're not aware 
of how similar our experiences can be. Many people automatically see other 
humans first as representatives of their kind . (sex, race, class, cool,  them 
,  us  ) It would seem that any environment where we attempt to ignore this 
categorical imperative might be a good thing. This is part of our goal; this 
is your invitation to connect.
 	If you pull back from your behavioral pattern for a few minutes, certain 
qualities of the modern world start to become evident. Science is being used 
to manipulate you. 'Advertising' is a practice used to trigger fundamental 
human desires- power, sex, comfort, et al- and channel those desires into the 
purchasing of particular products. This is not consciously meant to sap your 
energy, but it seems fair to say that it does. The hamster wheel of modern 
culture can lessen the value of art by distributing it as product, as a chunk 
of cheese to keep the gears rolling. Marketing makes calls based on mass 
appeal, muting, squelching, homogenizing the works of human creation. We are 
not about that. If we are doing a sequel, then it must part of a nonlinear 
series. Repetition is cheap, innovation is precious. If you make the trip, we 
ask: surprise us. Bust out the kind of art you create. 	Over the course of 
time, a small effort has been underway to experiment with various patterns 
composed of synthetically generated waves. These patterns function primarily 
as a catalyst for basic human communication and ritual interaction. It is 
debatable at what point in history this began, but archeological research 
suggests that the project has been underway longer than say, the building of 
roads, written language, or crop cultivation. We gather in a temporary nexus 
to use waveforms as an agent of communication. We convene, and break down 
whatever walls we can. What's behind those walls is different for each 
individual, because those walls are mostly present only in our own minds. We 
use dance as a form of technology, a tool. It's a gold mine of irony to 
consider the modern electronic devices used to generate beats. That's part of 
the key to it; that as far as we have come as a species, we still need to 
experience some basic feeling of joy in order to derive the inspiration and 
willpower necessary to do anything interesting with our lives. And we take the 
complex tools of the modern world and use them to get back to basics. It's 
part of the whole funky/flakey dichotomy, the yin-yang see-saw of 
cheesy/captivating qualities in the underground techno subculture. We're 
cutting edge, we're fashion casualties. We hear incredible patterns where 
other people hear mindless repetition. The scene is full of genius, but also 
full of people kidding themselves. It is a difficult question to ask oneself 
where on the spectrum you fall yourself. Scary. It seems to me at this moment 
that I spend most of my existence in an semi-automated cycle. Stimulus kicks 
in the response, and that's the extent of the brain activity. The human animal 
is remarkably susceptible to herd behavior and programming from the 
surrounding environment. It's distressing, truly, to wake up periodically and 
find oneself caught in the loop. But when you find a tangent leading out, and 
go active, it's worth all the drone time.
	A common historical focus for revolutionary thought centers around the 
development of a human means of expression known as 'music'. But what will 
happen when those who have banded together in the name of this activity find 
that their own efforts have come under the sway of tradition, shallow mimicry, 
capitalism, and rigid social codes? This is a test of the makeup of the humans 
gathering together- do we submit to the social forces of herd behavior, or 
abandon the thing and bitch about how cool it used to be? Or is it possible to 
periodically break through these impediments and recreate the past glories of 
earlier parties, reconnect to the source of earlier experiences? It seems that 
a better angle would be to abandon tradition and truly challenge the 
participants to innovate. Ultimately the vibe is up to the collective will of 
the individuals present, and what kind of interaction one has with the music 
is completely up to the mind of one person: you. This is not the challenge of 
one event in particular or whatever- this is a question of how you choose to 
experience your life.
	The idea is not to market an entertainment product to the trendy masses based 
on a hot iconograph of obsession with the other [alien], but rather to collect 
a group of musically experimental humans into a cloistered environment where 
we can explore what it is to be broken down at the galactic equivalent of a 
closed down truck stop.
	Now, please don't get offended by the next bit, unless it's meant to offend 
you. We ask a simple thing: Please keep your brain in your head. Absolutely no 
alcohol or drugs. If you're so cool that you know it's fine and dandy to be a 
cracked out chump, please go be a cracked out chump someplace else. To put it 
sideways; upgrade your launch method- or burn up on re-entry. Nitrous oxide 
will be grounds for booting your loser butt out. Anytime you join a community, 
it is common courtesy that you not take risks with the good time of all 
concerned by being thoughtless. Oh yeah, writers- come prepared to throw down 
murals on the site, but only on the boards provided. Check? Now, a few more 
tedious demands, then back to the campy idealism...
	Please make your best effort not to pillage and sack any nearby towns. 
Kentucky is a rural, chilled out kind of place.  Please go out of your way to 
surprise the natives by being friendly, nondestructive people. Please come 
prepared, with food, water, camping supplies, agents of bug removal and all 
that practical stuff. As in, prepared to stay at the site once you arrive. We 
will take whatever measures are necessary to protect the whole of the event.
	This is a transition point for techno music. Do we stagnate or evolve? Do we 
cash in or dive for the deep caves? Do we change what goes down or let the 
change happen to us? Dynamic systems flourish where lesser ones lock up. The 
way reality maps itself out over time is that choices fall somewhere into a 
spectrum, rather than a clear decision being made. It's interesting to watch 
how things go down when all you have is a small say. But if many individuals 
decide to pursue a similar goal, the results are astronomical. Evolution only 
happens when bands of neophiles go out and attempt new things. The music has 
evolved over the years, but has the setting in which we gather around it? We 
hope that you will join us in an effort to push the envelope, to create the 
environment to connect to the sound. That's as simple as it gets. Travel safe. 
See you there.<j2@cyborganic.net>

hi gals and guys,

i am estatic right now because i found something so valuable 
to me in my local commercial record store's used bin:

an autographed copy of moby's "disk" cd rom!!!!!

some idiot went through the trouble to get the thing signed,
and then sold it for a measily 4 bucks or so....!
i know alot of people on this list went to see him when he 
toured here (pitt.)_ last summer, and i know that he signed 
many autographs that night....so my question is:

did anyone here get that disk signed and then sell it?
i would like to know for two reasons:

1.  to make sure that it's not a fake.
2.  to yell at you for throwing something like that away!

thanks.
love,
evil ninja ryu

Whenever I come home from a party there is that terrible dilemma:  do I 
listen to a mix tape or The beatles?  Van Morrison is also lovely for 
watching the sun come up.
--------end of tangent-------

My dearest little massive,

I seem to be explaining my situation often these days, so for those of 
you who know me/give a shite, I wanted to let you know I'll be moving to 
Philadelphia come the end of August.  I am originally from the area and 
I'd like to spend some quality time being a big sister again while I save 
money to travel in Latin America.  It will prolly take me a little bit to 
get settled into a new place and net access provider, but I do plan to 
stay on pb-cle and hopefully visit Pgh frequently.

Even tho I'm a relatively new convert (a lost sheep if you will), I've 
had fun and learned *a ton* and will miss the wonderful people I've 
gotten to know.  

well, I'm not going to write a eulogy b/c that would be silly and 
melodramatic.  besides, I'm not leaving for another 3.5 weeks.  :)

fyi--that's all.  Like bartles and Jaymes would say, thank you for your 
support.

:),
steph

i might be going from cleveland (west side) with two other people.  so that
means i could take one more.  and if we have another car (which is possible,
but not certain), we could take 2 more on top of that.

> A Church?  

In short, this party was delightful.  It was clear that a lot of work and 
planning went into it and from what I could tell, it went off really 
well.  

The space was great, the basement of an old church (I took guilty, 
Catholic pleasure in thinking about the people who would be singing the 
opening hymn a little while after we left).  It was a big rectangle of 
generous width, nice smooth floor, cozy, cushioned pillars, clean, 
stocked bathrooms.  Security was nice, lights were great, sound was good, 
and just when i wished there were reentry so I could get coffee down the 
street, I noticed the snack bar, well-stocked and reasonably priced.  i 
guess you could say there was a chill-out entryway.  Anyway, it did the 
trick.  Also, you could get there by public transpo, which always makes 
me feel more comfortable.  And the DJs...

As a heavily biased jungle snob, all I can really say about Bleu, 3, and 
Sine's sets were that they sounded great to me.  I missed Dust, but of 
course Scott Henry's set was clean and great.  Slant's set wasn't 
perfect, but not bad at all and his selection of intelligent/etc made me 
happy.

Dieselboy's set was far and away the highlght of my night.  As I write, 
I'm being mesmerized by his side of the East Coast Science tape.  Yeah, 
it's old news that he's a "professional", but in a world so full of 
oppressive medicrity, I'll always stop to appreciate excellence.  He's 
one of those DJs who's reached the point where I know it's good, but I 
can't put my finger on why b/c the skills are over my head and you 
can tell they're intuitive for him.  An old music teacher once called it 
"unconscious competence".  But enough philosophy.

Maybe there's a catagory for what he's been spinning that I don't know, 
but to me it sounded like hard intelligent and it wasn't an oxymoron.  
That's the kind of syncronicity I'm talking about.  Anyway, I was 
sweating like a piglet by the end and not caring about how I danced, just 
having fun.  I'd like to thank him personally for providing the perfect 
setting in which to initiate my brand new virgin whistle.  Thanks, 
Damian!  :)

I met some virgin ravers as well (there was much deflowering last night) 
and they were also delightful.  As always, shouts to Joe 1.8.7 who always 
keeps me moving, and to that cute boy I didn't have the balls to talk 
to.  

Great party, looking forward to the next one.  

love,
steph

Hey - all.  Wish I could have gone to Golden Joy, but alas, too little 
sleep caught up with me at the wrong time, and I slept through most of 
the day of the event and the party itself.

Anyway - I figured I'd tell everybody about a really cool on-line store 
called Velocity Records.  They have an awesome selection of jungle tracks 
- better than any I'v seen.  Plus they also specialize in Happy Hardcore 
and Gabber (though Jungle is their forte').  And they do have some other 
selections - goa, house, etc...  Tracks are ~ $9 each, but they're having 
a 10% off sale right now.  Plus, they just told me a sweet deal (after I 
made a fair-sized order):  If you tell them I reccommended you with your 
first order, you get your first record free and I get a free record too!  
So, hey, we all win!  (I don't know how they can do this, but hey!)

The url is
   http://shiva.nashdex.com/velocity

They're having some problems with their code right now, so I wouldn't use 
their web-page order-form, but just e-mail or call in your order.

On a non-rave note - anyone see Wierd Al when he was here FOR FREE the 
other day?  That was sincerly the most entertaining show, free or pay I'v 
been to in a long time.  Pay to see him if he comes back, it is quite 
worth it, even only to see the spatula-city commercial on a 
big-screen.  Yo-da! Yo-da! Yo-da! :) :P

hi all,
  i'm sure most of you assume that i want soji's 
phone number for the most obvious of reasons....
but that ain't the case.  see, a while back, he 
borrowed some records of a friend of mine, and 
never returned them, and my friend would like 
them back.  my friend has no way of reaching
soji though, so i thought that someone here might
know his number or something.  if someone can
help me and my friend out, i'd really appreciate 
it.  thanks.

love,
ryu

that's because he uses a friend's account and don't 
have his own.

while here....
i hope the turnout at your 2nd year ago is as good
this time as last.  there's a more diverse selection
of hardcore dj's too,,,,,and a bit more dancer friendly
i'd imagine!

Hey all y'all in cyberland-
Just wanted to pose a question.  Does anyone know the exact details about
IO3? As in what time we can start to arrive?  All I know right now is that it
starts on the 16th and parties on til the 18th.
Wondering if anyone can spout out the info and pass it along my way b/c I'm
gonna be on a trip and no where near a computer until the 16th.  So if anyone
knows please share b/c I know I'm not the only one who's all confused.
Thanks.
peace out wif wuv

Ok......Interstellar Outback will open the gates at noon. People with tickets 
won't need to wait in line. The music will start at 4 Pm for the third system, 
second system will start at 7 pm, and the main will start 8 pm. People should 
come before dark because you don't want to set up your tent in the 
dark......there will be water and electricity available on most of the camp 
site. So you can bring extension cords and lights. 

There will be two EMT's available. A store will also open during regular 
hours. Don't forget your swimsuits, sun lotion, clothes, tent, flashlights, 
batteries, basicaly anything you may or could use for 3 days. and forget 
attitude, don't need, don't want it.

There will be an information both at the entrance with the line up.

One request : IO3 will take place in a beautiful environment...keep it 
clean...don't be a litter bug

Have a safe trip and plenty of fun....more info soon....location will be 
released on August 14th.

I was there.  That was one of the best concerts I've ever been to.  The 
only performer in existence to have a synth-accordian.  Where were you in 
there?

Couldn't get too close because of all those damn chairs, I was hovering 
on the far right side, with an ok view of the stage...until everyone 
stood on their chairs!  I was wearing my hawian shirt that I wear to lots 
of raves...so if you see a sorta-long haired (in the front) kid in a hawian 
shirt - that's probably me.  Al is soo awesome...though I wish he had done
all of his old 'polka's on 45' medleys, those are my favorites.  Especially 
the one with warrants 'she's my cherry pie' AND 'the humpy dance' in the 
same polka!!  But the madonna & paul mccartney interviews were hilarious!

I'v always thought it would be a good idea, but i think wierd al should 
explore new realms of Jungle/drum&bass music with - you guessed it - 
Polkastep!

aside - Anyone not at 'Your 2nd Ago' last night: shame shame shame!!
You missed dieselboy spinning some great old uk hardcore and....gabber! :P
Lots of new faces - i wish I could have stayed. :(

As always, Interstellar will be as inexpensive as possible.  Tickets will be
$15 before aug. 1st, $17 until aug 15th and $20 at the door. This might seem

	Alright this has hit a nerve with me. I know this is not the SETI 
list but someone asked the question about why IO3 was having a PHD from 
the SETI Institute come and speak and why they were donating money to 
SETI when it would be "better to donate it to the homeless". I've got nes 
fgor you, despite what you may think SETI research was effectively 
beaten down and homeless when in 1994 just two years after the REAL 
search of Extra Terrestrial Intelligence begun at NASA Congress cut 
NASA's funding of it. This search would have covered the scale of all 
previous searches in less than a year (and did). You see SETI isn't this 
thing that has been going on continuously for for 30 years as alot of 
people think. It has been a rather start/stop thing with HUGE gaps. SETI 
is not the primary focus of radio astronomy as many people think it is, 
and it has to compete with alot of "higher priority" things like looking 
at the radio emissions of a black hole in a galaxy 50 million light years 
away (when we could be picking up TV signals from an alien civilization 
50 light years away). The NASA SETI search would have lasted 10 years and 
would have covered 95% of the sky and the entire reagion of the radio 
spectrum which we can reacieve clearely from earth. SO basically due to 
some close-minded Congressmembers NASA SETI became homless if not 
outright dead. Even though NASA SETI came to less than 1/10 of 1% of the 
federal budget, Congress would rather sink that money into things like 
giving tax breaks to rich people, building more weapons we don't need, 
restarting the Star Wars program, etc.

	Today I'm sure many of you heard on the news or read in the paper 
the discovery of ancient life on Mars announced by NASA Today. I watched 
the news conference on CNN and if this is confirmed then this date will 
be taught to your kids in school in the same way that we were taught 
the date of the Moon Landing, the launching of Sputnik, etc. This also 
raises the stakes that SETI WILL find something IF it has the money to 
look. Here is finally proof that life could arise on another planet right 
here in our solar system. Add to that the fact that we now know of 
atleast 10 other solar systems (the closest of which was discovered by 
Univiersity of Pittsburgh Astronomer George Gatewood at Allegheny 
Observatory, a place I can walk to in 10 mins from my house.)

To put this all in perspective, a skeptical London book publisher today
reduced the odds of finding intelligent life elsewhere in the universe
from 500-to-1 to 25-to-1 because of todays announcement. 

What might we learn when SETI DOES find something? (notice I said when 
not if)

Who knows? A cheap or free energy source? A cure for nearly all diseases, 
a way to travel to the stars for very little money, a way of synthesizing 
food out of the basic 4 organic elements (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, 
and Oxygen)) thereby eliminating hunger, anew method of communication at 
faster than the speed of light (which would lead to REALLY fast computers)??

There are many possibilities but if we don't  look then we won't find 
them and if that person that asked what SETI has to do with the quality 
of life on earth still thinks nothing then I say re-read that whole 
paragraph again. Hell just knowing we are not the only intelligence 
might make people on this planet slowly realize that we are ALL ONE 
eregardless of nation, race, religon, gender, culture, politics, and 
whether we like house or jungle ;) (sorry I couldn't resist). All our 
petty squabbles here on earth would shrink to almost insignifigance. 
Homelessness and many other things could slowly be eradicated and we 
might enter into a new era of peace and cooperation. Remember 
homelessness has many causes, half of which are social, the other half 
economic.

Knowledge that we are not alone in the universe has no price in my
opinion.  Kudos to the IO3 crew, I only which I was playing as this type 
of stuff has facscinated me since I was a child and my dad bought me a 
big book with pictures of the planets.

Wierd Al was phat!
I even had to indulge and fill out a credit card form to get a free
flashlight in my fav colour green!
Good thing they dont check ID's!
I thought it was a really good concert and as far as smells like nirvanna,
hey you cant even hear the orginal artist live anymore! So why not hear a
phat semi-cover.
The celebrity "interviews" were hillarious!
I saw AlTV but still cracked up at the Alynnis Morrisette "ironic"(?)

Firstly, we would like to thank everyone who came out to
Sickness/Recovery.

We hope everyone had a good time.  For the info of people who would like
to know, we had roughly 2500 people!


We would also like to extend our apologies to those who tried to listen
to the event via the proposed realaudio broadcast.  As many of you
already know, in the end, there was no broadcast.  This was because the
actual location of the party had to be changed only days before the
event.  The final cornfield location was far to remote for the cellular
backup plan, and we didn't have enough time to drop in the special phone
lines that had been ready to go at the original location.  Another of
our backup plans was to record the show onto Dat, and then rebroadcast
apx. 10 hours later.  This plan was also foiled because of the location,
due to the huge amounts of dirt and dust that our Dat player didn't 
appreciate.  I'm sure that the digital crowd out there are as
disappointed as us,  but we'll be planning other events using Realaudio
in the coming months, so keep your eyes and ears open.


SPECIAL THANKS TO Jeff for finally coming out to play at one of our
events!

Again, thanks to everyone who supported us for this event, and the ones
in the past.  

See you all soon.

Richie Hawtin

Ok, anyone who wants a tape, but didn't get one and still wants one; 
can go to Cafe 168 (protoculture records) and get one.  Or just come 
to something I'm spinning at.... I only have two appearances left in 
Pittsburgh, this friday at Mi Gnutz (boy is that the stooooopidist 
name yet) or at the next Your 2nd Ago (my very last appearance).  
Thanks, d.CYPOL

ps. MEGA PROPS to pittsburgh for being so friendly of a scene to work 
with as a new dj with an unfamiliar style  (especially the friends 
who helped make me computer literate Stoic, Maddock, C. Zero, plus 
many others)

Sorry for the many typos, I was in a hurry and had no spellchecker available.

On a related note I've been asked to play at IO3 and I would love to 
however I need a ride for me and a couple pieces of gear. If anyone is 
going from Pittsburgh I'd LOVE to talk with you.

MISCELLANEOUS INFO YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW IF YOU PLAN ON GOING TO LOST CITY
THIS WEEKEND:

1. IF you've seen the flier you will no doubt notice how they describe the
location: Chill out at a beach, jungle on the pier, and main floor in a
parking lot. Basically, from what I've heard, Baltimore Fuckem them up the
ass with the permits. I don't know specifics, but I do know that, "the
location might not be exactly how they described on the flier," is an
understatement.
2. As a result, the location will may be closer to D.C. than Baltimore
(that i'm not for sure though).
3. As another result, (this is almost certain), there will be a preparty
from sat. evening to about 5am and then the main party will be from 5am
till 4pm Sunday. I know not of the locations.
4. Don't be discouraged by these changes!!!!!  I'm sure the Ultraworld crew
has a hell of a trip in store for those willing to go with the flow!! (if
it was anyone else throwing this party i probably would have second
thoughts).
5. BUS TRIPS:  Phil/Candyman is organizing a bus trip that leaves from
Pittsburgh around 5 pm Sat. The cost is $50 for the whole package. (tickets
and roundtrip). more info at:  412.734.5252
-----OR----------
My friend Brendan and his friend are going to take a van if we can get ten
heads to pay ten bills for a ride. This ride will probably fill up REALLY
SOON!! If you need a ride and can't afford Candyman's bus, email me
enfo@psu.edu ASAP(like by Friday evening at the latest, this evening would
be better).

PEACE.

I am fowarding this info on the behalf of Tim (Evolution)

Sent: 	Thursday, August 08, 1996 1:22 PM
To: 	MW-Raves
Subject: 	IO3 site info

Everyone and their brother has been asking about the site for IO, so we
thought that we
would release a few more details.  The reasons for not giving out the
location are quite
simple; we don't want people coming to the site early and disturbing the
other people using
the site.  We have sole use of the facility begin at noon on Friday the
16th, however, until
then the site will be continuing business as usual.  The site is being
extremely cooperative
and supportive of our efforts; in return, we wish to minimize the impact
on their day to day
operations.

The location is approximately 45 minutes from downtown Louisville.  Exact
directions will
be posted sometime next week, probably on wednesday.  The site has over
3000, that's three
thousand, acres of land.  There are numerous hiking trails available,
including one 10 mile
trail.  There are also numerous other activities for your enjoyment, the
most popular of
which will be, of course, the large swimming pool which will be open
during the day.  Also,
there should horse riding available.  There are actual campsites available
with running water
and electricity.  Furthermore, there are plenty of real bathrooms and
showers.  The campsites
are huge so if everyone shares sites we have facilities for about 5000
people comfortably. 
All permits and licenses are secured.  The local authorities are fully
cognizant of our plans,
and we have their complete cooperation.  There will be several off-duty
officers working
security.  These officers have been selected by me.  Their job is to
insure the security of the
event.  The security at IO will be the usual Evolution security friendly
and helpful.  They are
there to serve you, not harrass you.  Please respect the space and use
common sense and
everything will be great on the security front.

The main sound system will be in a huge meadow, over four football fields
in size, in the
middle of the woods.  The event is rain protected, so we are on rain or
shine.  The other two
systems will be in nearby clearings.  We are limiting the sound systems to
three to minimize
the impact on the space, allow people to sleep (the camping area should be
well insulated
from the sound systems), and provide for a more cohesive vibe.  

There is on site store and restaurant.  These will not be open all night,
however.  So you need
to come prepared for the weekend.  There will be some food and drinks
available near the
main dance area at night.  In general, everyone needs to come prepared to
spend the weekend
in the woods.

Please, Please, respect the site.  This is an absolutely gorgeous outdoor
setting.  For once lets
not cut off our own foot.  If the site survives the weekend, then IO will
have found a
permenant home.  Not to mention the very favorable PR that our scene will
receive.  We are
entering a new vulnerable time for our scene.  Things are going well on
many fronts but as
our scene grows once again, we are receiving increased media attention, as
evidenced by
FURTHER appearing in the New York Times.  A little responsibility on our
part will insure
that the scene survives this increased scutiny.

Thanks for your time and attention,


Tim
evolution productions
your IO Co-Coordinator

Subject: Equinox (please read..)
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com

Hello everybody...
     Most of the messages written from this address have come from d-
cypol..but now I've decided to write one of my own.
     I attend Ithaca College up in New York, and last year I decided 
to start an organization dedicated to the purpose of throwing raves 
on campus and around the Ithaca area, called EQUINOX.  Equinox was 
started 'cos people at Ithaca listen (from my personal experiences) 
to the Greatful Dead, Phish, Dave Matthews, etc...and are intolerant 
towards those who actually listen to different shit than that.  
Students who come from the city who actually know what a rave is 
(believe me, there are people at Ithaca who don't know what one is) 
have to travel to Syracuse and Rochester to get their fill, or wait 
to go home.  So I started Equinox. 
     Currently things have gotten a bit fucked up due to the 
bureaucracy of the college (originally I thought I was going to get 
funded by the college, but then I got screwed and recieved no funding 
whatsoever).   Anyway, the point of my letter is that I WILL throw a 
party in late May of 1997.  Since it will probably be a free party, I 
will be relying on donations of all the people who attend and also 
from the fundraising I will be doing throughout the year (I am 
planning to fundraise my ass off).  I already have some potential 
performers lined up and I will keep on posting on the progress of my 
party to keep everybody informed; my email address will have changed 
as well since after August 18 I will already be at school.  
     I hope that I can count on the support of everybody so that my 
upcoming party will take off!  If anybody has any helpful comments or 
suggestions to help out I will be more than willing to listen and 
reply.  

Thanks!

-Dave.

I like the idea that Ray Bradbury has, ie that life on earth could have 
been spawned from Martian life.  Think about the global identity crisis 
that would cause.  That would be cool.....   ;)

In case anyone doesn't know, Kool Rock Steady, a Chicago hip-house
artist, passed away last week due to complications from AIDS.  

His Latin contributions to House, Hip-House, and the entire dance world
will surely be appreciated here in Chicago.  I will personaly miss him
but I know he will always be with us in spirit...

noise complaint???? what noise complaint???!!!
same old shit. . . . . .
probably one of them 14 year ol's mom calling worried about their precious
child . . . .
I walked around the campus at one point and you couldn't hear the music at
all from anywhere near a residential standpoint.
I still had a kick ass time. Actually I had a very magical evening last
night. I'm too tired to give a review. Dcypol was great  as usual... CMU's
campus was beautiful. Everyone there was beautiful...


oh yeah, does anyone know what the standard font people use for email?? I
can read people's sig files and mine is probable illegible to you guyz. I
use Times ....

First off, I'm tired as I write this.  Second, I still think the Jive 
Turkeys rock.  Third, I would like responses, please.  Your opinions 
are welcome if you'll put up with mine.

Don't know what to think of last night.  I was having lots of fun, when it 
happened AGAIN.  There was much whistle-blowing, but int he end, the cops 
blew the last whistle.  

I friend of mine had migrated to a hippy drum circle down the way.  That 
lasted until he couldn't drum anymore.  He was angry.  Thought about how 
they drum in Africa.  Like you drum and you don't stop.  Not an option.  
He was planning to dance all night, but things dispersed so fast.  
Dispersal, somehow, WAS an option.  This could be lack of unity.  or me 
being too philosophical.  

Was in philly the past few days.  Liked some things, didn't like others.  
one thing I loved was that after this so/so club event, half the club 
migrated to Penn's Landing and played mixtapes and talked and didn't 
leave til dawn.  That's (comm)unity. Authorities rode by and didn't tell 
anyone to go home.  I danced in a fountain and stared at the river.  It was 
beautiful.

Pgh outlaws are also beautiful, but they stop.  (I didn't go down to 168, 
don't know what happened)  What bothers me most is the point that my 
friend brought up.  that party didn't have to roll over and die.  And a 
couple people talking on the mic or talking with the police aren't 
enough.  It takes the whole crowd working together (peacefully) or at 
least a large chunk.  I heard people _complaining_ about the ppl trying to 
keep the party going.  It's like they wanted it to end.  If you have that 
attitude, why come?  

Just makes me wonder what would happen if ravers started going to parties 
cuz they actually wanted to rave, if they went in assuming it was their 
right to gather and dance.

My question is, why are people so eager to quit?  Are they _that_ afraid 
of the cops?  Scared they'll find your little drugs?  Are they _that_ 
necessary?  Is it apathy?  Is it a constant need for something else to 
do, entertainment provided by someone else?  These questions are not 
rhetorical.  I want opinions.

Fuck it.  I'm moving to Africa.

One of these days, I've got to dig my 'best of' tapes out of my 
collection and listen to them again.  It's amazing how many lyrics you

Most likely.  As far as I know, the residence halls are closed this late 
in the summer, so the cops couldn't have said that students were 
complaining.  Slots me off..

I couldn't hear anything until I was within about 500 feet of the site.

I wish I could have gotten there earlier.  I caught the last minute or so.

As did I. Which leads me to ask, how long before NO parties happen because
we roll over and play dead anytime the police come. Here was the saddest
case of a shut down ever. A CMU bicycle cop comes and tells us to shut
down and disperse. A CMU BYCYCLE RENT A COP!! Come on, they are little
more than glorified security guards. What's next getting busted by
metermaids? As I got on the wireless mic (yes that was me) and stated that
this was wrong (from out of sight of the cops funny because one was
practically yelling at Don the sound man tell him to "turn that guy
talking about rights off") I thought perhaps some of what I said would
sink in and maybe it has but I can't help get the feeling that we are
giving up our freedom each time we bow down to nonsense like this. I would
have asked for 1) a badge, 2) what authority he was acting on if the
complaint came from off campus and if not where on campus complained. This
is purely harrassment and well if any other group of people were faced
with this kinda of constant harrassment would not simply walk away.  Maybe
we aren't a group maybe we aren't a culture, maybe it is just convient for
us to think of us in that way. Don't talk about tribal this or that if you
ain't willing to stand up for your tribe. God help us if something ever
comes along like the Criminal Justice Act passed in the UK. I doubt we'd
survive. I think next time I will just call their bluff, let them beat me
down and get it all on video for the next day's six o clock news. Maybe
I'll even think of some catchy soundbite like "can't we all just get
along?" Thanks to Stickman for trying to work things out and Don for 
putting up with the harrassment.

Maybe instead of getting beat down, a more gradual, low-key approach 
would work.  (Joe, I'd really rather not see you beaten by the pigs.  :( )

Ok, not to toot my own whistle, but those of you who were there, remember 
when after the music was shut down and a couple people blew their 
whistles in rhythm for like 10 minutes and it didn't take people long to 
start grooving to it?  all it really takes is some energy and a beat to 
keep people moving.  If more ppl had joined in with the whistle crew 
(there were about 2 sincerely active whistlers, and when they got tired 
that too lay down and died) but more than 2 ppl had whistles, I know) and 
if a couple of drummers had come up and started pumping people up, it 
wouldn't have taken long for most of the people there to join in.  And 
with some joy, some danger, and some excitement, there's no telling what 
could ahve happened.  Maybe we could have waited out the cops and started 
back up quieter, or at least kept jamming to a really unique groove for a 
while.

Ok.  I can be shy as hell, but yes, the whistle on the gabber/latin 
rhythms, that was me.  But I couldn't do it alone.  I got tired and a 
little dizzy blowing my brains out all by myself for how ever many ppl 
there were.  And when I quit (which I regret doing), no one else took over, 
like I half expected them to.  that was not the time to be cool and laid 
back.  Even a whistle relay would have worked.  Clapping, yelling, 
stomping, anything to let ppl know, hey, it's ok to be here and be 
happy.  A signal that we were in this together.

_we weren't in it together, were we?_  to those of you who care, it 
really doesn't take much.  crowds are VERY  easily influenced, so keep 
that in mind when you're considering if there's anything you can do to 
help out in a situation like that.  If nothing else, stalling at least 
raises morale.  It's a start and you never know what's going to happen.

Ok, first off, I don't know if what happend with the whistles and 
stomping and all after the cops was normal for pittsburgh or not cuz I'm 
from cleveland, BUT I hadn't seen anything like that before, and I 
thought it was pretty special so I just started blowin an blowin my 
whistle to the groovy little rhythm the girl next to me had started (wuz 
that you?)

That had to be one of the coolest things I've ever seen at a party.. Cops 
come, music stops, joe gets on the mic about rights and 'dancin to our 
own beat', and our 'own beat' suddenly develops, whistlin' an stompin 
away...damn that was cool :)

I think it could have totaly blossomed into something, well, really neat 
had everybody gotten involved and into it, or maybe I'm just optimistic...

Anyways, I definatly had a *great* time despite the fact I didn't get to 
dance all night like I'd hoped, but hey, it's all good right? :)

howdy all,

i need some help from youse gals and guys...

starting this fall i'm gonna be the "dance music" segment of the music director
at wrct (88.3fm) pgh, and that entails writing to record labels, djs,
etc to get music for us! soo what i need is any labels you know of that
play:
                            ambient, techno, hardcore, trance, jungle, etc..

i only know a few labels that have jungle, 'cause (here comes shameless plug)
i have a show (this summer) mondays 6-10 am (time will change in the
fall) and i play 85% jungle (15% latin & lounge) so i am quite ignorant
of techno, trance, and the like.. but there are other djs here that love
'em, so i wanna bring it all in!! 

also.. if you happen to know anyone that would be interested in
underwriting with us.. whether djs (c'mon you pgh djs!!) or record shops
it's a way to get more exposure, more often!! 

and ...one more thing... send email about upcoming events, parties,
weekly events, and we can announce them on the concert calendar......

hey ... with your help, maybe there will be many more times you'll tune
into the radio and be able to shake those baggy-panted booties of
yours....

                                                        much gratitude 
                                                    and funky beats,    
                                                                      amie

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

NET RAVERS:

I am in the process of compiling a list of stuff to bring to IO3, cause I
know sometimes I forget important stuff if I am not reminded.  I'll post it
later.  Also if you are going please send me your name and I am going to
make a list of net people to find :)  Oh yeah someone tell me if this is a
bad idea, but i think maybe we should try to all cook together or
something, i dunno i don't see why we would need 30 separate campfires when
we could just put our resources together and share i think it would be
easier that way (or it could be worse)...give me input.

Massive LOVE and HUGS,
Benjamin

Well said Steph...I was only able to stop in for a brief time during
Dcypol's set.  I had not heard that it was shut down.  Unfortunately most
ravers are not informed of their rights and furthermore do not want to
exercise them.  ne1 who heard Joe187 drop knowledge at Candyman's house
after Ortho understands that the problem is not going to get better on its own.

Point in fact, the city walks all over kids because kids don't exercise
their rights.  Don't think that kids alone are for raving and adults are
against it.  I know many adults that are displeased with the city's attitude
toward ravers.  Right away they said to me "I'd rather have my kids at a
rave than out on the streets".

But hey it's all about priorities.  I'll bet not more than 20 ravers were at
the demonstrations in squirrel hill and the northside in support of a
civilian review board for cops.  The cops and authorities know that we
aren't an organized bunch and THAT is the reason that they walk all over us.
Because they can and they no that they aren't gonna get much of a fight.  We
need to mobilize and get the ball rollin' so to speak.

I've heard certain people talking about how they'd love to hold a party
specifically for getting the word out.  Well DO IT and I will be there in
any fashion you need me support etc.  Moving to africa is not the answer,
the answer is changing the scene here.
"I have gained the ability to communicate with corn!"
"You know what they say, if the shoe fits, eat it."
"Yes ma'am thats right, I don't have my homework 
because my friends smoked it"

i might bring my "america works best when it says 'union yes'" shirt. then i
would probably fit in with ky from the waist up (since phat pants don't). 
also there's a funny story about that shirt. i was with my mom at my little
brother's baseball game + all these clothes of mine were in the car. i was
wearing just about the raviest strangest looking clothes like i always do,
except for my shirt that i didn't like so i was going to change it to
something better but my mom got mad about my clothes + she said i should try
to fit in because of all the hilljack type people there. so i put on the
union shirt that my mom had never seen before + she thought that was
hilarious when she saw it. actually i would be in a union if i worked in a
place that had one. fortunately where i work, they don't care how phat your
pants are, what color your hair is, etc. 

more stuff to bring:
toilet paper (in case they run out)
sweatshirt in case it gets cold
candy + toys of course

and does anybody happen to know what the water around there is like?  since
it's probably going to be out in the middle of nowhere. at family affair 2
the water at the campground tasted like iron (well water) which was pretty
bad, but the water at the gas station nearby tasted like a natural gas smell
that was really strong + i couldn't stand to drink it.  it's a good thing
those people in the josta trucks came bearing free cans of josta.

Also its a good idea to bring a towel (a la The Hitchhiker's GuideTo the

shit i can't remember all the addresses i cced this to, anyway i forgot
something else. if u are going to swim (particularly when under the influence
of certain substances!), bring goggles because u can see under water then
which is very trippy, especially looking at the surface from underneath. 
although i'll share mine with other people. swimming while on e sounds fun,
it probably makes the water feel reeaallyy good! there's so many things to
bring though, u never know what you'll need. like at fa2 my shoelace broke a
zillion times so i just had to make a makeshift shoelace out of twine. i'm
going prepared for anything, i just need to try to pack lite (don't worry
trout soup, i will. i won't take up too much space in your car). bring
band-aids, a flashlight (if u have one. i don't so i will make do with my
lite-up toys), bug spray, pocketknife... by the way, if u see me, ask to 
see my holographic kaleidescope.

Subject: Re: Stuff to bring to IO3 =)

i might bring my "america works best when it says 'union yes'" shirt. then i
would probably fit in with ky from the waist up (since phat pants don't). 
also there's a funny story about that shirt. i was with my mom at my little
brother's baseball game + all these clothes of mine were in the car. i was
wearing just about the raviest strangest looking clothes like i always do,
except for my shirt that i didn't like so i was going to change it to
something better but my mom got mad about my clothes + she said i should try
to fit in because of all the hilljack type people there. so i put on the
union shirt that my mom had never seen before + she thought that was
hilarious when she saw it. actually i would be in a union if i worked in a
place that had one. fortunately where i work, they don't care how phat your
pants are, what color your hair is, etc. 

more stuff to bring:
toilet paper (in case they run out)
sweatshirt in case it gets cold
candy + toys of course

and does anybody happen to know what the water around there is like?  since
it's probably going to be out in the middle of nowhere. at family affair 2
the water at the campground tasted like iron (well water) which was pretty
bad, but the water at the gas station nearby tasted like a natural gas smell
that was really strong + i couldn't stand to drink it.  it's a good thing
those people in the josta trucks came bearing free cans of josta.

Greetings & salutations...

 I'm trying to add dj information to the Pittsburgh-Cleveland homepage 
(http://http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/pb-cle/)  It's basically free 
advertizing, and will definitely add something useful to the page.  
What I'd like from you is:
DJ Name (and real name if you want), style(s) of music you 
spin/produce, contact information and availability - ie. a phone number or
address, info on any available mixtapes (including comments on style, for 
those not in the know) or material produced and how to acquire them, email 
address if you have one, and if you want a short bio on dj'ing career, events 
spun or favorite tv show as a child (not nessicary).  Also, if you could pass
this along to other DJ's on or off of the net, I'd be much obliged, because I 
want to make this page as thurough as possible.  Also, as I'm not in or 
from Cleveland, anybody who can help me on that end would recieve an 
autographed by Wilfred Brimley packet of instant Quaker oatmeal. :)

Thanks,
  Geoff Maddock

Wow, this summer went by fast!!!
        Just wanted to let everyone know that this rave list has been
essential this summer and i'm glad i logged on. I'm going up to Penn State
on Sunday. *sigh*  However I will be at ELITE Saturday with my video camera
so watch out!!!  I haven't been good about showing up at net meets,
organized or unorganized, so most of you don't know who i am. That's okay.
Just keep ravin' and we shall meet if the gods deem it so.
        Keep an eye out for FREE PARTIES AT PENN STATE. I've seemed to got
a lot of people at PSU and Pittsburgh interested in the Growth of a scene
there. It's a very unxperienced if not virgin territory, which could work
out for the better. People at Penn State do whatever's cool social wise; so
its not like they don't like raves, they just need some people to tell them
what's cool.:)
        Don't shed a tear, i'll be back online before you know it. (ha, you
thought you could get rid of me, he?) I still love Pittsburgh and am
dedicated to keepin it alive......

love,

I first want to say that I had had one of the best times I've had all summer!!
Since I was part of this situation i feel i need to say that i tried, i
really tried to save it. I walked around screaming "I LOVE THIS PARTY!!"
and continued to dance to the little stomping rebellion. I went up to one
of the cops and asked him nicely for his badge number, he wouldn't give it
to me. "Do you have probable cause to tell us to turn this down?" I asked
him. "Yes or no?"  And do you know what he told me:"You're not serious are
you????"   That's when I knew he couldn't do shit.
        I know I'm not the only one who tried. I was having a great time. I
was under the impression that other people were too. How could a biker cop
get in the way of our vibe like he did? Maybe Stickman could have dropped
some knowledge to ravers. I don't know, I'm still baffled as well at the
number of mixed reactions to the "protest" or, more accurately, the
"persistence" of our few strong motivators.  Which makes me wonder whether
people were there as a haven away from cops,  or as a place to dance to the
phatty fresh underground toons and meet some phatty fresh people. Or before
I'm jumping to conclusions, it's probably what I've agreed on with many an
experienced raver: People don't know their rights. period.
        No one is going to search you for drugs at a rave. I have never
ever heard of a rave raid in which everyone had to be searched before they
left the party. If you give them a bad attitude, they will not be nice to
you. Simple. I thought we learned this when we were 12 years old and got
caught throwing apples at the cops or with some spray paint. It really
frightens me that if we couldn't stand up to a man on a bike in the name of
your love for dancing, why were we there??? Some cops don't hate us. so why
autimatically assume that "oh a cop's here, we have to move this party" If
indeed the ocifer had a noise complaint we are oblicated to turn it down or
reposition the speakers. But that wasn't the case."YEah lets go to the club
and pay $3 for your troubles, oficer." I still don't understand!!! I'm just
rambling now, but I could go on forever. I just hope someone hears me.

I don't quite understand the entire story here, as I am waaaay out here 
in Massachusetts... so let me understand this straight..  Did the Turkeyz 
get written or verbal permission from someone who works or administrates 
at CMU for the use of the space?    Because if that is the case, I really 
have no idea why the party could have been shut down that easily.  Joe 
LeSesne (a Turkey) can obviously remember FLUID back in '93 which was 
thrown right outside of Wean Hall with no snags from the authorities.  
I'm pretty sure that no problems happened there, and if my memory serves 
me correct, there were still some students in the halls that summer...

hmmm

Just ask CMU and I'm sure that they would be receptive to an outside 
event there if you ask politely and state your case.  Of course, if all 
of this WAS carried out prior to Mi Gnuttz, I don't understand how a CMU 
officer on a *bike* could have shut down a true Turkey event.

I stopped in the place to check the gig out....  I was way whacko... 
A good thing though....   I caught a set of reggae (who was that 
Dj???)....  

I checked out the drum circle which ws very cool indeed.... There 
were good vibes all over....  The party was small at least when I 
left it still was..... But a very positive vibe..

A big up to Pete for stomping all over the cop crap's attitude.

While at 168 last night I got into a conversation with a younger cat 
about the scene in Pittsburgh and in other places in general...  
After that massive tunnel stunt a while back the city seems to have a 
shitty attitude towards events... But hey feel good,  since Philly 
has an ordinance now preventing raves in the city (aka no music after 
2am)...  So unless you suit everyone up with walkmans the vibe is not 
moving in philly after 2am...

Now really this cop problem and all the others could be easily 
avoided.... I have no real like for police at anyways so here is what 
the scene needs to do, to survive...:

1) Promoters need to secure the proper legal basis for an event... 
This means securing permits where needed and being straight with the 
owners of the property...  Tell the owner and the other intruders the 
length of the party (hours),   what it is for,  expected crowd, etc.

2) All the promoters need to get together and appoint someone a 
media/relations person...  Someone who can speak English,  is not 
dosed every event,  who looks somewhat normal etc.  

Perhaps a board could be formed,  in the case where the individual 
might not be present at an event or such.   In the past 187 has done 
alot in this are in my opinion,  as have others such as the immortal 
Stickman.

3) Pittsburgh is very small. As such we have a limited crowd,  a 
limited number of sites, etc.   A media relations project should be 
started....   A good start would have been the Enit festival.... But 
oh well...

A media relations project would and should consist of establishing 
contacts in the media who are somewhat accepting and understanding of 
the culture, establishing a means of free advertising via the 
reporters, announcers, etc. And generally getting a good word out...

I know I hear (*COMMERCIAL*) being thought in everyone's mind.. Face 
it folks,   any half decent dimwit who wanted to find out about the 
Pittsburgh scene only need to go to a coffeee shop pick up some 
flyers and go to 2 events and they know the scene.... This is not a 5 
million person metro area underground...

4) Promoters need to be straight with the ravers....   Like I want to 
know from the Turkeyz  who gave them clearance to use the CMU spot 
and what their part of the agreement was to do such....   

Promoters have to say what is what when it happens....  And in a case 
like this perhaps  some punk police fag just did not like all our 
shady characters....  But we do not know.....

Bottom line,  promoters need to promote and do it on both sides,  
whether positive or negative...

I did not read the earlier messages... But I would assume that the 
music was too loud....   I often think the speakers are being driven 
to much for no real good reason actually.... With the landscape there 
the Turkeyz were getting alot of echo  and perhaps the country music 
listeners or something on campus just were tired of the thumb...  Or 
some people had life important exams or such.....  Again may the 
promoters promote and get to the bottom of things....


I know in like 92-93  I went to an event someone held at CMU in I 
guess it was a chow hall.....  and it was smoking... 187 played a 
live set and there were people everywhere... There were no police 
problems,  even though the fire alarm went off no less than a dozen 
times...

I don't thnk CMU is a bad spot at all... I do think being straight 
with people and being careful of not interferring with other people's 
lives is a good start to having events there without incident....

Police should never have to bother us.  We have to police ourselves 
and repect the world as much as we should the scene.  Respect those 
sounds and keep the decibels down sometimes when you are around 
sleeping folks and such....

Most of all be straight and tell everyone what the problem is so 
people are not afraid of coming to your events....

Hi there. My name is Clint. Im just starting into the rave scene around here.
If anyone knows of/is going to any raves soon, let me know. I went to Trilogy
in the flats and i was up in the booth w/ Rob Black and Ian Mariano and they
can spin their asses off. Rob's mix tape is the shit. OH YEAH..if anyone
wants to start a shitty production company with a 15 year old, email me. My
experiences tell me that no one takes a 15 year old seriously when it comes
to raving, but it's tough when your body is 15 and your brain is 21.

If anyone in the area of Portage County, Geauga Co, Summit Co. in Ohio would
like to start a SMALL production company with me (im 15) then drop me a note.
No one takes me seriously when i bring this idea up, but maybe someone like
me out there will. We can do it...i think.

I have more comments to make about this last post in The Thread That 
Won't Die, but I'm tired from IO3 and I want to chill in the park.

But first and foremost, it was mentioned that if the party was too loud 
for the neighbors they had a responsibiltiy to turn it down.  Well, from 
what I understand, IT WASN'T.  Kids walked around campus and said itwas 
way quiet just around the bend.  I myself walked around, butI don't 
remember exactly...I don't know why.  I guess I was in such a good mood I 
didn't think too watch the party's back.

Well, that's it for now.  Shouts to the pb-cle crew who got muddy and/or 
sick in Kentucky this weekend.  :)

You have to go to the "regional lists" section of Hyperreal.. (on the 
first main page) and there will be a link to the Pitt/Cle pages... :)

I'm here (back from IO3 which was Awesome). I played a live set of

Subject: 	Thanks for IO

Frenche and I would like to thank everyone who helped out with IO and
participated.  Most especially I wish to thank everyone who respected
the site.  This was the most respectful group I have ever seen at a party
before.  We made a great impression on the local people and on the city of
Louisville.  The city actually likes us and has offered us the site for
use at any time.  Imagine that, City officials offering the use of public
 land for a rave.  This is what respect for a site can do.  If this sort
of attitidue was displayed by the scene as a whole, our pr image would be
a lot different.

Other than the attendence, we could have not asked for a better event.
I am very disappoint in those who chose not to attend because of the lack
of the mega-headliners.  All of the djs at IO were highly talented, with
several of them headed for that mega headliner status in the future.  All
of the DJS donoted their time and services for this event and they deserve
our thanks and yours.  We decided to devote our efforts to make the best
possible event from a space and technical stand point.  All the equipment
and labor was donoted as well.  It is unfortunate that so many people
chose not to appreciate our efforts in that regard. 

So I will pose a question to you.  What do you want from the next
Interstallar, if there is one.  I mean we could have added lots of
big-names and charged $30 or so.  Is that what you want?  Even at $20 we
still lost heavily.  We weren't going to make money in any event, but had
hoped not to have to pay for all the bills out of our own pockets on top
of donating our time and equipment.  So we are asking you what you want?

Word, kids. I'll have a review of that time period in particular,which was 
absolutely one of the best blocks of time throughout the party.  But I'm 
not going to post it now b/c it was so [hard to find an adjective for] 
that I want to take some time to do it justice.

I've lost my voice...that gives you a clue as to what my weekend was 
like.  :)

Hey all.  This is Steph in Pittsburgh, the one who recently wrote a sappy- 
ass post about how much I'll miss you all when I move to Philly town come 
September.  

Well, I believe the 30th we're having a big ol' house party down here and 
my one roommate (I have 5, or 4,depending on how you look at it...) has 
gotten 3 indie-type bands to play in the basement that night (the night 
b4 bassrush).  I thought it would be cool (and so do my roommies) if we 
had people spinning afterward.  Can't offer money, sorry, but there 
will be yummy goodies and stuff like that, and hopefully a really diverse 
collection of people. Hopefully a pretty big collection of people too. Oh, I 
believe we'll have an adequate sound system for a low-key get together, 
but unfortunately we don't have tables.  :(

Anyway, if you'd like to come and spin in a relaxed "there's no such thing 
as failure" atmosphere and meet people and sip cocktails, please write back.
I'll have to talk to my roommates some more first, but I might just post 
an open invitation in the style of Count Zero.  (How was it, Frank?  Wish 
I could have been there...)  

BTW, we're a chill, open-minded house, but we LLLLOOOOVVVVEEEEE jungle! 
<hint hint!  ;) >

hugs and brownies,
steph

maybe this question (i know i ask so many of them) sounds silly but,
what is it that makes a hard drug hard? are there any soft drugs
besides pot? that is the only 1 i can think of apparently not being a
hard drug. by the way count zero, i heard your parents wouldn't let u
go spin at io3 because u had to do homework. what a dumb excuse they
gave u! u should have told them u would go anyway + do your homework
a different time.

somebody named sugar bear wrote this to me, and I am making it public so
that I can explain myself...

>by the way count zero, i heard your parents wouldn't let u

>gave u! u should have told them u would go anyway + do your homework
>a different time.

this message completely floored me.  I mean a) i wasn't even asked to spin
at io3!  and  b) my family life is really none of anyones business.  Now, at
one point during this summer, I was getting hassle from my parents about
going to parties and getting paid for gigs and things, and yes, it did have
something to do with the fact that I had a lot of overdue schoolwork this
summer... But, since when did that shit become public information!? I mean,
WHAT THE FUCK!?!? I really really really believe that someone in Pittsburgh
is out to get me.  I really would like to know what the fuck I did to
deserve such treatment! I am soooo steamed right now.  As if anyone should
have to put up with booking hassles because of rumors, hearsay, or bullshit
trash talking!!! If I am not a good dj, FINE, that is something I work my
ass off to change EVERY SINGLE DAY.  So I don't have the hippest new Jungle
or slow breaks records?  Well, fuck me up the ass I play what the fuck I
want to play, and, oh, btw, I _do_ have jungle records and I do have slow
breaks records :P I don't spin ambient.  But, nobody has given me a chance
to show that.  Listen to me whine! This is what I have been led to! CHRIST!
ARGHHHHH! well, i dunno, I'll see you all at The Rewind, and then Quantum
Bass in Erie (where someone actually gave me achance) and then at That Thing
(maybe, if the promoter ever returns our agreement) Sorry this post was so
inflammatory, I just was really shocked by the message that landed in my
box... :/ I still love Pittsburgh, and I still love calling it my home, and
I have great memories of the parties I first went to here.  I just wish I
wasn't looked at as an outsider...   love  -Count Zer0

Frank... what did I say about the language... ;)  Heh... just kidding...

Apology accepted.  :)  Um... I, personally, think that Pittsburgh is a 
closed minded raving city (I have a feeling this is a bad thing to say in 
my first post to pb-cle-raves, but, oh, well...)... um, I mean, of all 
the posts that I've seen so far about the rewind and blah blah blah, I 
dunno... *babbling* Pittsburgh just doesn't wanna give anything but 
jungle and house a chance.  I mean, what the hell?  Ravers in Pittsburgh 
don't even KNOW what goa is, and they don't know anything about ambient 
except for *swoosh swoosh sputter swoosh*  Come on.  That's bogus.  

Frank, if people in Pittsburgh would have seen/heard your set at Lost 
City in Baltimore, you'd be booked ALL THE F'N TIME in da burgh... I 
mean, god... come on... so many people were dancing to your set it was 
just AWESOME.  (I'm listening to the Scottie Hardkiss mix btw... thanks 
again!).  Sorry.  Um, but yeah, you kicked ass, but people in Pittsburgh 
hear "Oh, yeah... I spin ambient" and they're like "*apsh* whatever... we 
gotta stay with our jungle and house.  We have a reputation to uphold."  
Which imho is bogus... It really is stupid to have Pittsburgh known in 
the raver community as "Jungle City" or whatever.  The point (for me 
anyway) in being a raver is experiencing ALL different types of techno 
and blah blah blah... not building up one kinda of techno and that's it.  

Anyway... in short, Frank, I just wanted to say that many many people on 
the East coast know that you rock the house, even if Pittsburgh isn't 
gonna give you a chance... and after "This Thing" I'm sure that 
Pittsburgh will know what the rest of the East Coast has already known 
for a while... no worries... it's all good.  :)  :)  :)  :)  

Sorry this kinda sounded like a diss on Pittsburgh, but it's totally 
not... I love Pittsburgh parties with all my heart... even if I don't go 
to that many (Yes, I HAVE started to save for a car, finally!)... I just 
think we have to get off this jungle/house/happy hardcore kick that we're 
on... there's SO MUCH MORE out there to experience.  *waiting for the 
flames to pour in*  Oh, well.

Love ya guys.

All I have to say is PLEASE spin something other than jungle at the 
events people... Jungle and hardcore... Blahh....  Soo damn good to 
hear Farmer Tea spin some reggae at the last Turkeyz event.... I kow 
all the PB raver flavers could not hack it really though.....   

Please bring a second room to the events people.... 

I want my ambient,  I want some house, and gimme some dancehall 
reggae.

Respects to Proby and the Count Zer0.  Don't know where that shit about
homework came from Frank, but who gives a shit what people have to say
about you or your personal life.  All I can say is keep studying 'cause
there's nothing wrong with the search for knowledge.  However, personal
attacks have nothing to do with this list and I'm sure you wish as much as
I do that it was kept off of here.  I'll say nothing more of it than I
hope to see you spinning again soon Frank, and I'll have that mixtape to
trade with you by the week-end.  Let's get working on this Youngstown
thang again...

Now, this is where I do feel the need to comment.  It took a lot of work 
before Jungle was accepted in this city.  I love the fact that we're 
considered to be a place to hear Jungle!  Most of this probably has to do 
with the skills of Dieselboy and 1.8.7., so respects to them for giving 
Western PA some notoriety.  It wasn't too long ago when Junglists had to 
hope and pray for a Jungle set at Raves.  Yeah, in the last year or so 
there has finally been an explosion in the Jungle scene, but it was not 
always that way and I'm glad that I can catch a Jungle set in Pittsburgh 
three out of four week-ends in a month.  I still go for Hip-Hop and 
Dancehall sets, but that's off topic for this list, I guess. Let me just 
say that my vote is in for more Jungle and Hip-Hop sets in the same night 
like we used to do at Kaya ... I'm not much for the bleeps and blips that 
you techno-heads go for.

Maybe we'll see the scene split in the states like it did in England, then 
you'll almost never hear Jungle at the same party as techno, acid, happy 
hardcore/4 beat etc.  Can't really say that would bother me too much, but 
I do like the variety we have in Pittsburgh compared to other scenes.

> Sorry this kinda sounded like a diss on Pittsburgh, but it's totally 
> not... I love Pittsburgh parties with all my heart...

Word.  On a side note, there have been a few ambient only parties and 
they were cool affairs, with more "chill back and watch the video 
projections" kind of things going on than dancing, but that was cool in 
it's own right.  I think some illbient sets are nice once in a while.  We 
need Telecorps to bring Spooky and WE back into town to school Pittsburgh 
on what a powerful illbient set can do to the mind. 

Anyways, I'm out...

Thanks for the support ... :-) Respects due to Lenny also since we were
tag-teaming that set.  Although I like to spin both reggae and Jungle, it
was nice to be asked to spin a Dancehall set for a change. I haven't done
that since "The Final Comedown". If you REALLY want to hear a *dancehall*
set, all I can say is go to 168 on Saturday night and check out my
partners in the First Class Sound.  Original Bubbles and Militant Barry
definitely know how to throw a party, and the dance crews that show up are
too wicked!  Watch yourself boys ... it can get hot in there (hehehe).
Also, I hear that The Drunken Master will be spinning some dancehall
tonight at Your 2nd Ago at 168, as well as some illbient by DJ UMMM and
the usual hardcore bizness, so see you there if you go for things other
than Jungle ;-).

I'll second that.

Wasn't the FIRST IO free?  I don't remember paying anything - but I do
remember driving back and forth across Kentucky, not even getting annoyed
cuz we got kicked out of every space we went to and that was only because
we hooked up with a huge weirdo caravan of people and it ended up being
fun.  I remember leaving just prior to someone overdosing on heroin (now
THAT'S always good for the "rave scene" PR, dontcha think?) and watching
St. Louis kids put Mr. Bubble in a huge fountain in the middle of
Louisville (or maybe it was Lexington?  Forgive my Kentucky ignorance)
- and I remember that I had to leave in the middle of Josh Wink's set (and
after a night of that freaky midwestern BAM BAM BAM Satanic music (don't
flame me, I'm being funny) I was SOOOOO greatful to stagger back onto a
dance floor and hear some amazing um, whatever it is that he spins (house?
trance?  housey trance?)  There were other parts to that weekend that I
remember well that were really cool - we musta spent $100 on gas alone but
still, it didn't seem like anyone complained - I coulda SWORN it was free,
tho, wasn't it?  When did you start charging?

Hey all.  It upsets me that people are all kind of catfighting over styles 
of music they like and don't like.  Farmer Tea and I come from similar 
places 
musically; ie, I love the whole jungle-hip hop-reggae flava continuum.  
There are other styles I don't like as much.  But feuding because we 
have different tastes is really hurtful and divisive.  That's like 
refusing to be friends with someone because they like M&Ms and you like 
Reeces Pieces.  Or maybe like refusing to admit that Reeces are damn 
yummy sometimes, even tho you'll always come home to M&Ms.

The more I listen--REALLY listen--to all the kinds of music you can hear at 
a Pgh party, the more I realize how dumb I've been in the past for 
summarily writing off this style or that one.  Every party I go to or 
tape I hear gives me a new angle of appreciation.  

It would take a lot for me to get into house, hc, hhc, gabber, techno, 
etc, the way i'm into jungle and stuff, but that's notbad.  The important 
part is that _music_ itself hit me in a new way.  It's like that Bjork 
song that says that Graham Massey's tape "starts off cells that haven't 
been touched before...these cells are virgins..."  

I think the important part is to remember that we were all touched in 
some way by something about this scene, be it the beauty of certain 
music, the surreality of the situation, the atmosphere, the philosophy, even 
the style.  Whatever it was, it doesn't really matter.  And I'm notsaying 
everyone's one big happy family and we're all the same.  Not at all.  But 
I think it would be good toput the differences into perspective.  They're 
not that big a deal, certainly not something to get bitchy, or even worse, 
closed-minded about.

By the way, for the record, Ithink ambient is possibly one of the most 
misunderstood realms, (I know Idon't totally understand it) but one with a 
huge potential for experimentation 
and beauty.  I was listening to Count's tape on the way to IO3 and it was 
really beautiful.  The point is,sometimes you forget about certain angles 
when they're not at the center of attention and it's refreshing when you 
get that back...like hearing it again for the first time.  All those who 
feel underrepresented, chances are your time will come, especially 
considering how short Pittsburgh's attention span is in particular.

Whatever, have a nice day,
steph

btw...many thanks to those who responded to the wanna spin at my house 
request...I'll be getting back to you with a quickness.

Some people made some comment about the lack of so called big name deejays at 
IO3.

IO is not a regular event. it is about music, about people.

How many of you have seen Carlos, Terry Mullan and others big names spin this 
year in the midwest ? (the above names are just exemple, not to be taken as 
negative remark)
a lot...right

How many times have you heard Bliss(Baltimore) , or Kise (new Orleans), Star 
(Chicago), Cylert or Sho.....and so on in the midwest this year ?
We offered you something different....a good mixture of talent from 
everywhere. We gave you a chance to hear some people that you never heard off, 
or not enought.
Why did we have so many dj...it is because they came to show there talent and 
voluntered to do it for you. We could have put over 200 deejays on the bill (I 
personaly received over 130 tapes and I don't know how many Tim got), but 100 
some deejay's was already a logistic nightmare. Personnaly, I will never again 
deal with so many dj's because there are always a few (meaning more than two) 
who will screw things up.

As far the laser is concerned, Centrak's laser was there and set up ready to 
go, but there was one problem, a big lack of amperage. The laser could not 
fire. We tried to get a generator large enough for saturday, but most of the 
business we called, either did not have the gene required or were closed. Yes 
we did check the electrivity in the park...but when we came to set up, we were 
surprised to see a transformer with 3 phase input reducing it to single phase 
on the output. LGE (Louisville Gas and Electrcity) company left the 
transformer locked up and there office were closed.

Now....I want to thank each and every one of you for coming out. This was a 
party to remember...we don't care if I lost money, we were happy to see every 
one enjoy a great weekend and we made still made a donation to the SETI 
institute despite our loss. 

Btw, Dr Shostack loved it. at the beginning, he said : "I don't think I can 
get into this type of music"...on his way the airport, after a two people told 
what type of music was played at parties, he said : "I like Trance"


On this note, once again, thank you    :)

French E (still enable to walk, due to worn out knees)

PS : I like to also thank the two girls that practised random kindness by 
bringing me food and drinks.

I like this discussion about interest in other genres besides jungle and
house, but didn't think anyone liked the reggae Farmer Tea spun at Mi
Gnuts..(Not an insult to you Toby, but what did you expect) Don't get me
wrong, I like reggae, but that was like straight-edge-white-boy-reggae, not
that soulful rasta-pass-the-bong-groovy kind. That's just my opinion.

:-)  The tracks I spun are all produced by Jamaicans in JA or in New York. 
Not a single white boy in the crate.  I din't play Snow did I?  I was
spinning a dancehall set, not roots music or dub, so there wasn't any Bob
Marley/Culture/Burning Speare/Mikey Dread etc. in the set either, which
may be why it didn't sound like reggae to you.  My set was the likes of
BeenieMan, Capleton, Bounty Killer, Shaggy, Mad Lion, Majette, Michael
Rose ... all big names in the dancehall/ Reggae Hip-Hop style of the last
couple of years.  Some of the tracks may be more soul or R&B oriented, but
I wouldn't call them straight edge white boy music!  Anyways, the intent
was to spin something a little different before my Jungle set just to mix
it up a bit.  Can't please everyone, I guess.  I had fun, though ... 

Anyone who *did* like the set, I encourage you to listen to my show on 
Sunday nights 'cause we spin Roots reggae/dancehall/Jungle for two hours 
and you'll get to hear the latest tunes straight from JA, New York, and 
London.  If you tune in, definitely call in and give your shout outs.

respect,
Toby

two words -- hell yeah! the only party i've ever had the fortune of
hearing reggae @ was the [really small gettogether] party over in regent
square @ the turmoil room and that really was the bomb... it was a very
chill atmosphere and everyone was having a great time. the second room

I just wanted to post publicly to the list to wholeheartedly thank those
wonderful people who came to my side with words of kindness during my recent
bout with a severe lack of self esteem and rumors directed at me (or
something like that) Farmer Tea, Stevie T, Proby, Trout Soup, Mindkiss, you
guys all kick sooooo much ass! Love ya all! Also, anyone I may have forgot
to include, you rock too ;) Thanks again guys! I needed that. :)  Anyway,
also just wanted to let you all know that I have gigs in Erie on sept 7 and
in Pittsburgh on Sept 14, and that hopefully Farmer Tea, Dj Ummm, and I will
be going to Cedars (or somewhere else) on a Wednesday (or a Monday?)
sometime in September, as the Pittsburgh dork music crew invades ohio ;)
hehehe, ok myabe I'm the only dork... Anyway, also, be on the lookout for my
new mixtape which should be out by September's end, I'll post to the list
again with more info about that... :)  Oh, and one final word, to anyone who
cares, I am available for bookings anytime after Aug 25, except of course
sept 7 and 14, as I am already booked those nights... No parents are going
to stop me from djing, for sure!!!  ok, much love and respect and things :)

ok, so, I just read the sunday paper aug 11, and now I'm really confused...
they had this BIG long article about Enit blah blah Starlake blah blah,
acting like it was going to happen... so was the whole cancellation thing a
scam?  did Enit really happen last thursday?  Or did the paper just publish
the article before they knew that the Pittsburgh date was cancelled?  I need

Pardon me but Pittsburgh is a city that likes to DANCE, perhaps that is 
why most people view ambient as something that is more suited for a chill 
out room. AMbient is fine for big events where 90% of the people are so 
far off their heads that they are incapable of moving  however.

Oh yeah IO guess that's why D-Cypol (an"outsider") spins HappyHardcore
sets that seem to fill floors and have everyone whooping it up right?
We're just so close minded that we can't get into anything other than,
Jungle, and House, oh and Happy Hardcore, oh and Hard Trance, oh and Slow
Breaks. 

As for our reputation, I've traveled far and wide and I would like to say 
that is not necessarily a bad thing.There are few cities in the US that 
can claim something of their own. Those few cities like San Francisco, 
Detroit, Chicago, Miami, and to some extent NYC allare homes to much 
talent which usually specialize in on genre of music, be it Detroit 
Techno, Chicago House, Miami Bass, etc..Here in pittsburgh it seems to be 
Jungle and Breakbeat House, for that we are known and recognized across 
the country and slowly around the world. That is something to be proud 
of, not dissed. I'd rather have Pittsburgh known as Jungle City than "The 
City that bites Baltimore's ass"

Whatever, tell that to the average Detroit raver where Detroit Techno 
reins supreme,you won't hear much jungle in Detroit, or San Francisco 
where Progressive House is "THE RAVER MUSIC" or Florida where Slow Breaks 
is the music of choice, every city/region has something that their crowd 
is more receptive to. If you understood the history of the scene here 
you'd understand why Pittsburgh is a Jungle and House town. Our scene was 
founded on Breakbeat so of course people here are more receptive to 
jungle and the breakbeatier (is that a word?) forms of house and hardcore.

It is no suprise to me that when we tried being like Baltimore we lost a 
good amount of the crowd that was going out. Pittsburgh was founded on 
HARD music be it hard breaks, hard house or hardcore. Understand that and 
you'll understand why ambient is not nor will ever be a big thing here. 
People are once again starting to return because the music is getting harder.

I would suspect some reasons Frank doesn't get booked are because of his 
tendancy to whine and bitch, the fact that he early on made a major snafu 
when he called WTAE after TunnelVision and the fact that he spins a style 
which is just percieved as not a dancefloor style. Also I might add that 
he is new and new DJ's are not booked that often until they have a proven 
track record, hell it took me as a LIVE PERFORMER 3 years before I was 
consistantly booked. Did I whine about it? No, I paid my dues and Frank 
will have to learn to do the same.

Oh yeah, right, goa trance, and ambient. People like what they like 
Proby, you can offer them something new but if they don't like it 
promoters are going to go for the tried and true the next time. I don't 
see why you and Frank are bitching, he's got a spot on That Thing doesn't 
he? Oh but we are all so close minded.

there was a story in the post gazette the day before the news about 
martian bacteria came out, i think it was a tue, not a sun, but it 
mentioned enit and this was before starlake knew enit was cancelled.  
remember, the announcement only came out like a week before enit never 
happened.  So the story you saw was probably the same case.

that was a pretty hatefull message..
and i have to dissagre.. i don't think they were "bitchin"
just givin there oppion, witch is a right of their's without being personly
attacked. now mabye you took it as a slam on jungle.
thats life.  everyone i know in pittsburgh is tired of jungle, and feel like
they have had it slammed down onto them.

ambient new? its the oldest form of techno. hell, its even pre-techno.
goa-trance is new, but i've never heard any in pittsburgh.

>Pittsburgh was founded on 
>HARD music be it hard breaks, hard house or hardcore. Understand >that and

"is not nor ever be"? wooh..  how can you say that, when you are a junglest
[joe] wasn't that once said about jungle all over the US.
and still is true in some parts of the US.

yes, people are coming back now that the music is getting harder.
there is almost a move to split the scene into the junglest, and techno
headz. witch is the point i think it will reach here soon.

one last opion well im on it, ironicly enuff to the conversaation. i've
always considered jungle to be a chill out form of music.
i'd rather lisen to jungle in my room and chill. then hear it at a "rave".
accualy I do lisen to it some time's in my room and chill, its good for that,
the bass lines are nice and smooth, very relaxing.

well, i hope no badness was portraid. it was not my intention.
much respect to joe. he's been here longer then most of us.

plus respect to da count & joe187 for sticking by the music they luv.
we all should stick by the music we luv because thats why we're in the scene
we are, but lets not scrap on other forms of the same thing just cause we
happen not to like it as much, cause some one out there luvs that form as
much as the form you luv.

.bleep.

I do not think I personally attacked Frank. Just pointing out that many 
people have mentioned to me the fact that he tends to bitch alot. It 
seems like every other message from him on here is a gripe of some sort 
or another.

> now mabye you took it as a slam on jungle.

Nope. I took it more as a slam against the scene here in general (which 
is not perfect) but I am proud of what we have and well perhaps he should 
move if he doesn't like the reputation we have. It was hard won.

> thats life.  everyone i know in pittsburgh is tired of jungle, and feel like

I'd be willing to bet these are mostly newschoolers who don't know the
history or transplants from other scenes who don't understand it. 
Pittsburgh tired of Jungle? naww. Tell you what, go to the Rewind and 
tell me that. For your information there are people trucking here from as 
far away as Philly, Cleveland, Baltimore, Cincinatti, Canada, Virgina, 
even fukin' Kentucky for it. If that room isn't packed I'd be highly 
suprised.

>

I never said ambient was new, I said it was new as far as being consider 
a *dancefloor* style. Most people still look at ambient as something to 
kick back in their living room and listen to.

Of course it took time and talent before jungle made its way in to the 
US. Of course jungle IS and has always _been_ a dancefloor style.

> yes, people are coming back now that the music is getting harder.
> there is almost a move to split the scene into the junglest, and techno

They say the US is about 3 years behind the UK and the jungle scene there 
split off about 3 years ago so this is no suprise. I figure by this time 
next year there will be the techno/acid/house scene and the 
jungle/dancehall/hiphop scene.

 Ironically, the jungle scene there is undergoing another split into the
hardstep/techstep stuff and the
ambient/expirimental/"intelligent"/jazzstep stuff. So if this historical
trend continues you can expect this to happen here around '98 or '99.

Funny but you must be listening to the more chilled out stuff. Listen to 
some hardstep and tell me that. Try some Dilinja for starters.. Jungle is 
most definately speaker threatening, massive soundsystem music. Many of 
the records are cut specifically to be played on at least a 10Kw sound 
system. Most jungle is most definately, flick up your lighter, airhorns 
and whistles, hands in the air, dancefloor stuff.

It should not matter how long I've been here  other than I know the 
history that many may not. (as do Stevie T and Rick Worth).

As I said I meant no harm by the message.Just being honest and pointing 
out some things I don't think Frank was aware of.

Whether anyone would like to believe it or not, and regardless of what Proby
has to say about things, I have never dissed the jungle scene in Pittsburgh,
and when I go out of town, I am PROUD to say that I am from Pittsburgh, the
top U.S. Jungle city. I admit that there was a time not too long ago when I
didn;t even know what jungle was (I distinctly remember almost dissing it
right before a certain party at the fairgrounds) BUT ever since that ride to
the fairgrounds my opinion of jungle has changed.  For almost a year now I
have been digging the fierce sounds of Pittsburgh (and other cities) drum
and bass.  And, I am proud to be able to say that I learned it from
Pittsburgh.

i only read the past few posts on pgh jungle, but i have to say..

i have only lived here for one year, coming from miami florida, but i have
learned a decent amount about the "scene" here.
this is the city i learned about jungle (ignited by jungle warfare 1)
and continue to learn. i trained and got my own jungle show on wrct
recently, and have had 
countless unknown people support me through this bboard when i've posted
questions
or requests. people even listen to the show and offer their opinions. through 
stephanie i've met a small network of people, all who have been very 
receptive, and, again, supportive. and how did i meet her? through this
bboard, while asking for advice. it was the love of jungle that allowed
me to meet fellow
ravers. coming from such a rude, unfriendly, selfish city as miami (not
to mention
techno/house based and not too jungle-friendly at all) this city has
overwhelmed me with its support for fellow junglists and, yea, for
people in general.... 

i may not be some expert, but from where i stand the jungle scene here
is pretty 
damn good.. besides that.. who the hell cares which city is better, who
has more
toys and bigger needles.. etc.. this is the city we live in and the only
thing that matters is making this the most fun, productive, and the
repetitive word of the day, SUPPORTIVE...scene and uniting this here
massive.. 

     enough optimistic preaching..                 
                                                    and that's all she
wrote.....
                                                                        amie

WHAT?????  <confused look>
Some jungle is hella chill, hella ambient, hella "jazzy" and when it goes 
too far, hella boring, 

and i will say that sometimes I have to just sit and close my eyes to able 
to take it all in and ride the music, 

but when Timestretch played at Tribute or when Soulslinger spun at Family 
Affair, or when Dieselboy, Farmer Tea, Adair, 1.8.7, and all the 
other quality dj/producers this city has to offer do hard, dark, or jump-up 
sets,  

or when I hear "the s the u the p the e the r..." or "you muthafucka, 
you-know-who-I'm-tal-kin-to, you that muthafucka who betrayed your 
homeboys and you ain't sssssssssssssssshhhhhiiiiiiiiT!", Damn, I can't sit 
down! I'm all hot and bothered just thinking about it.

To all the non-junglists, you ain't ssssssshhhhhhiiiiiT.  ;)  JK, writing 
in the same style as this thread, is all. hee hee hee  If you think jungle 
is only to chill to, come over my house sometime and we'll listen to 
basslines that will make you shiver.

Hello....

I am out herein the burgh'....  Like most of the styles....  Don;t 
necessarily like all the Dj's spinning styles....

I am looking for some people to swap or purchase massive mix tapes 
with.... All styles considered....  No competitive buying/swapping... 
Just a normal person looking to get a decent collection of Dj sounds 
together....

If you have a tape, CD, etc.  that is recent and you want to get some 
coverage send me a piece of mail indicating such and tell me what

does anybody know if it's possible to be immune or partially immune to
the effects of e? i've done it twice now but both times felt almost
nothing, just tripped barely like as much as 1/2 hit of acid if 3 is
enough. the 1st time the quality of it was'nt very good but i don't
think it was fake. the 2nd the quality was supposedly pretty good. the
other people who were doing the e felt it but i didn't. maybe i need
to do 4 or 5 es at once because i only did 1 at a time, but that would
cost me like $100 which is way too much.

well... i'd say buy the e from a different person next time :)
i dont know if there is some way to be immune to the effects of MDMA, but
e is mostly speed + some heroin (or so i hear) so i doubt that you could
be immune to such a combo of drugs.

Subject: jungle in the rave tree
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

        If you don't want to hear my in depth personal opinions on jungle
and house, i still think you skip to the dotted line and start there.

        When i first heard jungle i think it was at 31 Flavors in Ardmore
Roller Rink (MY first Rave!!!). yes folks, it took me that long. I was
fascinated by it's intensity and funkyness. I was like,"oh so this is where
the funk comes in to techno."  then i realized it wasn't just funk. it was
reggae. it was R&B. it was hip hop. it was evrything. The fusions that the
rhythmic style allowed were very far-reaching. It was like a new world of
musical possibilitites, whereas the old skool "rave" music didn't give much
room for rhythmic variation. How many techno beats have you heard that have
a kick on the upbeat and a snare on the downbeat?? not that many. Now i'm
not saying house and trance etc. aren't dynamic and creative. I'm saying
they're designed to be hypnotic; regressive. The sound of an 808 kick twice
to every heartbeat has entranced the souls of millions. And the music over
top of these beats was influenced by 80's style electro and the even
earlier disco.
        My theory is that as this music started to gather more and more
people, those people had grown apart from disco and electro. I think a
bunch of hip hop junkies got a hold of some samplers and some speed. I know
its not that simple; breakbeats came into the picture before you could call
it jungle, but it was the single most important step that seperated house
from jungle.
        Anaway, i know a lot of people who can't listen to jungle for more
than 30 minutes straight because of its rhythmic complexity. Most people
can't dance to it when first exposed to it. It first reminded me of a huge
drum fill. Gradually as i exposed myself to it I started hearing the snare
loops as one sound, not a trill. I started hearing the sped up hip hop
beats as one groove and the looped 808 bass drops as another. And you get
to pick which one to listen to and which one to dance to. You start to
seperate the complex rythyms before you act on them. oh, and those nice wet
rewind sounds!! This is why i love jungle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Alright, here's what i really had to say: (the tree analogy)
        For these same reasons, some people will always stick to the house.
They like there beats clear and straightfoward. Jungle is one branch on the
rave tree. If someone cuts it down i will cry. In the same way, house and
trance are on another branch. If someone chops that down i would cry. I
need both at a rave!! They balance each other dynamically. When you need
something fresh, you climb the jungle branch. when you want some thing hard
and hypnotic you go to the trance branch. All-jungle parties won't for a
long time attract as big as a crowd as parties with both general styles.
Case in point: Steel City Jungle had to change its name to Steel City
because half of its Dj's were spinning house or electro. (which was on the
lower floor where most people were.)
        Another important reason why we need both styles at a rave has to
do with the evolution of new music. Coming back to the rave tree, if all of
the growth was concentrated on the jungle branch, you put so much
gravitational pressure on the roots of the tree. The tree will evenually
fall over. If you put more growth at the deeper rooted house and trance,
the tree won't be funky enough. if you decide to play it safe and keep
listening to the same shit, the tree will start rotting and die from the
inside. New genres will emerge from both branches, so don't worry about
these happening. But have you ever heard of progressive jungle????  As much
I love jungle, i would rather we chop of the jungle branch than split the
tree in half. That way our roots would still be intact and we could evolve
again from there. Face it, not everything can evolve from jungle itself.
         In my opinion, anyone saying they want jungle and house to split
to seperate groups should be shot. Jungle is still a little boy, (a
beautiful, funky child, i might add) but needs to mature a little more in
order to function alone in this world. I think some people whose names i
will not mention need to get off their little jungle trip, swing off their
little jungle vine like Tarzan,  and return to home to where you came from,
the house, because that's who really loves you, bitch. ;)

just wanted to let everyone know that i'm
back online now...about 4 hours west of 
pittsburgh though....at penn state.
yes, i'm going to miss the pittsburgh 
scene,,,no matter what type of music is
played there.  anything is better than the
damn hootiefish/macarena fussion fecal
that is popular here....
whatever changes pitt goes through,,, 
remeber that they are just changes, and 
most things come around again....so there's
no need for panic or whatever.  hell, i never
thought in my wildest dreams i'd be hearing
a hixxy or brisk track at a local rave
(that's happy hardcore), but this summer i did
and was overjoyed!!!  just don't get totally 
discusted and give up, because that only makes
things worse for everyone....
i'm babbling, so i'm going to go and pretend
to study again....

love,
ryu

As well written as that was I think you missed the point. No one was 
saying that they wanted jungle and house (and derivatives thereof) to 
split. They were saying that it did in England and it most likely will 
here should the rave scene undergo another "explosion" like in 92 and 94.
The gravity pulling jungle away from the rave scene has been pulling for 
some time. As for your comments about jungle not being a "mature thing" 
and "have you ever heard of progressive jungle" check your head man. 
Jungle matured long ago and has diversified into styles as wide ranging 
as ambient, ragga, hardstep, techstep, jazzstep, and yes even progressive 
jungle amongst many others that still haf defied labeling. If you want to 
here some progressive jungle I suggest you go buy LTJ Bukem's Logical 
Progression. Jungle a little boy? Please. I think the best testament to 
jungle being rather grown up is the fact that LTJ Bukem regularly spins 
on Radio One in the BBC and the fact that Dr. Seth Shostak of the SETI 
Institute (a man in his 40's) asked if I had a tape available after my 
live performance which was just before his lecture on the scientific 
search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

Don't kid yourself, jungle is just as mature as any other genre of dance 
music, ie: house, trance, techno, etc. Just pick up a copy of MixMag.

who are the mc's that will be one the mic @ Jungle Warfare II: The Rewind?

(I personnally don't like jungle without MC's, unless its the ragga stuff
or in my tape deck/cd-player ;), but no MC is better than a bad MC)

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

please note: parking near OSU campus is difficult and towing is enforced
24 hrs a day, so please watch where you park.  do NOT park behind
apartment buildings or residences, if need be park several blocks away and
walk, it is worth not getting towed.  thanks for your patience! 

and please keep in mind that this is intended to be a different kind of
event...more like the debut of new music by electronic artists than a
"rave," so please come early to pay your respects to all the performers
(who are playing for free!).  finally, there will be a small gathering at
the space after the performances (latecomers welcome). 

see you there...

That statement assumes that we come from the same forest.  My tree is not 
in the progressive house/electro woodlands.  So how am I supposed to 
"return to the house that I came from" when that never was my home?  I 
return to my roots every week-end by going to 168 to check out the 
dancehall and hip-hop.  I don't go to coffee breaks or dub that often 
because house and electro is not where I'm at.  I can see the forest for 
the trees, I'm just STAYIN' IN THE JUNGLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fuck yeah!  :)  :)  :)   Wooo haaa!!!!  (I sound like an overenthusiastic
member of the breaks list!)

I appreciate other styles, don't get me wrong.
BUT, jungle calls people not only from other trees, but from other 
forests, glens, clearings, little shrubbery, vacant lots, fields of
poppies, etc.  No dis on any other style, but jungle roped me back into
this scene.  I tried it out, jetted for a while, then came back in full 
force.  

I'm not making up excuses to be seperatist; far from it.  But I've seen
the evidence.  You can play all the techno, house, prog trance, etc
you want for my friend Craig who is an indie rock lover and Velvet
Underground freak, and the only response you will garner is a moody
knashing of teeth.  But play him some hard, fast drum and bass tracks, and
he turns it all the way up.  He didn't even knowthat jungle wasconsidered
part of the "rave" scene.  

There are plenty of people who go ape for jungle who barely know the rave
scene exists.  People who come to it from hip hop are one example.
Jungle has a twist that many other "rave" musics don't.  That's not a dis
or anything; just a fact.  And any raverwho hates jungle will tell you the
same thing. Maybe not in those words... I think in this country anyway, it
is often a unifier sort of like how house was a unifier when _it_ first
came out.

this is not to say that eveything else you hear at a rave has dry rot.
But understanding the differences can help you understand why the music is 
doing what it's doing in Europe and here.

When,  I have some vines to swing from and some loinclothes to iron,
so I'll see yall tonight.  :)

just in case you hadn't heard, (i'm not on ner so i don't know if thishas
been a hot topic but i haven't seen it on pb-cle),
the location of bassrush has changed.  Same djs, but no swimming or
camping.  I don't have the new directions in front of me, but I'll post
them like tomorrow or so.

I've been advised not to post direx to bassrush.  That's a good idea.
Anyone who needs em, mail me personally, or get them where you got your
tix.

See you there.  :)

Oh, had a great time at The Rewind.  That's the tree I'm in, no doubt.

sorry to sound overbearing and negative about jungle everybody. Everyones
entitled to their own interests, and when it comes to musical tastes it
isn't a decision made consciously. You like what you like....I just feel
like a mother who wants all of her kids to appreciate and enjoy everyone
else's creation.

 I just don't want to see jungle leave the house.....that's all;)

I also don't own any jungle records; what i hear is mostly at parties and i
still haven't heard of any progressive jungle. I guess i should try to find
some...

nice space, nice sound, good lights + effects, liked the bingo board
behind the dj's, refresment stand a plus (not cheap, but not expensive
by club/rave standards), crowd was into shit, but it was not crowded as
Jungle Warfare 1,  187 was tearin shit up as i got there, then
Odi started to spin, the man ripped shit up (i had seen him spin the week
before also), cutting quickly from one track to annother, mixin like there
was no tomorrow, played a jungle mix of "If I ruled the World" by Nas, then
came the Dieselboy, "oh my good ... and the east is in the house ... oh
my good" ... the MC's were a bit more vocal during dieselboys set ... so
i was happy he played a track w/ the Blazay Blazay (sp?) sample, "oh my
god", at least i am pretty sure thats where it came from. The came
Phantom 45 from Chi'town. Scratchin' and mixin ... played "the Lighter"
which was my favorite song for like all of last year ... i left 
just as AK1200 took the decks ... peace to all the happy nutters and
netters i met ...

cheers

i just found out this thursday dieselboy + special k are booked to
spin at europe gyro in kent ohio. the # of the gyro is 330678GYRO but
if u call +they dont' know anything (depends on who answers the phone)
e-mail me i will find someone who knows. it is on depeyster st in kent
next to the firestone tire place. it is probably free although i
giuessl it is posible they would charge like $1. it should start at
10pm.also they sell beer,  pizza, gyros etc. incidentally i will be
djing there during when theres equipment (should be every thurs now
i think) but at times nobody is sceduled to spin. right now i'm not 
good enough yet to get schedulesd to spin or to get paid i am  still 
learning. so nobody needs to travell long distances to hear me play,
i just thought i'd let people know that if theyre in the area, there
will be music there weekly for free admission. anybody is welcome to 
bring records & play at times that i am. unfortunately stuff around 
here doesn't seem to be very organized so all this stuff is like for 
the time being. i dont;' nkow of anylonmg term plans but i will post 
stuff as i find it out.

aramos had neat'o visuals and stuff, but it was too short.
ihannoa was way cool, but way short.  i was just starting to get a groove on
(really rare!) and he just stopped.  oh well.  the djs were cool and lots of

dayton stunk saturday night.  armani cancelled, didn't find out until after
i paid *full_price* at after 2 am.  i was told 2 others cancelled, but
didn't know squat about the lineup.  the dj in the main room from 2-3 was
really stompin.  dont hear much of that stuff.  i didn't find out who he

Subject: HAPPY: People Power

Having closed down Hardcore Heavan at Alexandria, the party moved to
Graffiti Hall, where again, the Police decided to turn up and wanted to
closed it down.

However, because ravers love their music and their scene, everyone sat down
and refused to move out of the venue. After realising that they couldn't
force 200+ ppl out of the venue, the police left. What people power!

The funniest thing was, about 10 police officers were their with their paddy
wagons expecting a riot, but us ravers just calmly sat down and refused 
to move. The whole scene was touching really.

I heard that a girl said to a Policewoman "What are you going to do?
Arrest all of us?" And the police officer replied "Shut up you bitch".

I think everyone should be proud of the ravers at HH who refused to let the
police close down a party, and doing it in such a calm matter that involved
no violence.

Tuey.

Probably because Americans have been taught that they have no rights and 
the police can do what they want therefore it was no suprise that ravers 
ran away from 2 rent-a-cop's on bikes at Mi Gnuttz. We could have easily 
just stayed and they would have left. As I said, like it or not, you're 
living in a police state as bad as any former communist country. Seeing 
the actions of people and the "police" at mi gnuttz a person from the 
former Soviet Union said that even in his country people would have 
stayed at least until the police did something.
 just some thoughts.

Subject: Review : Laurent Garnier / Sleepy C / Swank in Cleveland
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

After doing Back together in Chicago, I went to set up sound and Light in 
Cleveland for Laurent Garnier.

The last time I talk to Laurent was back in 1991 at the Boy in Paris. Five 
years later, he is still the BEST DJ on this planet. He can mix like no other 
DJ. He made the music flow like a dream, his levels were more than perfect, he 
was teawking the eq all the time, but kept his levels constant at 0 db, plus 
or minus 0.5 db. I have never seen anyone else keep there levels so well. It 
was a real pleasure listening to him again. Now, the music his played was 
incredible. I was so tired from not sleeping from the previous night in 
chicago, but he gave me the energy to dance for the five hours he was 
spinning. This was a night to remember.

Swank did good, but like Laurent said : "a little bit to hard, to early" and 
Sleepy C did a good set and finished with his newly produced track.

One thing I was disappointed with was the attendance. Some promoters go out of 
their way to bring you good talent, people ignore that. How many times will 
you get the chance to hear someone like Laurent Garnier in your lifetime ?

See you at Rave'm and Baile

Attention: DJs and PAs...

We're in the planning stages of throwing a HAPPY, FUN, CAREFREE event in
Phoenix AZ sometime in the near future...

Location: Phoenix, AZ
Date:     Sometime in November.

The theme will be based on two subjects:  a. the board game CANDYLAND and
b. the Japanamation series CANDY.

We want to bring back the childlike lollipop vibe for one nite....complete
with legos, fuzzy clothes, play-doh, props in the above theme, CANDY....kids
stuff!

And we need musik to fit the theme.  Anything HAPPY....bouncy tekno beats,
happy hardcore, children's songs, whatever!  Anything that would put a big
shiny grin on all the kids who show up!

If you spin HAPPY musik, make HAPPY musik, or know someone who
does...leave e-mail for me at the above address.  Or contact me at:

J'eh
PO BOX 87882

it's a little out-of date for me to be posting this since the event was 
last friday, but i wanted to say a few things and post something more 
substantive because i havent had much time to contribute lately...
i'd also like to say some things about the ele_ment series as it now 
stands, one year after it began.

boron was, in some ways, a failure.  only about 60 people actually showed
up despite a decent amount of promotion, etc.  i'm not upset about it,
really, because that's what i needed to cover my budget, and as always i
do these ele_ment events mostly for myself and a small group of
appreciators, but it made me really ask myself some hard questions. 

people really just want a party, dont they?  if i'm going to continue to
do events that are an attempt to challenge what YOU might consider a
"rave" or "event" to be, then i guess i'll have to compromise if i want a
substantial number of people to actually show up. 

in a way, i dont really expect people to drive hours to get to columbus by
9 or 10 pm just to see some local acts play live for 3 hours, so i'm not
condemning anyone who may have seen the flyer at IO3 or wherever, and
didnt come (so don't take any of this personally).  but what i'm asking
is, what do i have to do to get people involved and interested (without
wasting too much energy)? 

i've tried throwing after-parties for these events, to draw more people,
and as a complement to the usually-serious mood of the concerts, but
they've sort of backfired because so many people dont show up till like 1
am, after the performances are over, so they miss the whole point! 

but on the other hand, i'm not willing to move the concerts any later. i
want to keep these events in the early-evening, because i want a wider
variety of people to come.  i want the ex-ravers, beatniks, cyberpunks,
computer-geeks, artists, etc...the whole spectrum of techno-appreciators
or anyone who wants to try something new.  

i'm afraid the rave scene has lost it in this department...we really arent
reaching anyone except young people (some of whom are here for the right
reasons, but many of whom are just here for a quick dose of rebellion/
drugs/fun before they move on or drop out).  what about all those people
who like techno, buy it, or are open to it, but _don't_ go to raves (for
whatever reasons)?  

those are the people _i_ want in my scene, i dont know about the rest of
you.  i want people to be at an event because they like the music or
because they want to experience something NEW.  when's the last time YOU
went to a party and felt your own ideas about what a "rave" could be were
challenged in real ways?  probably never, i'd bet.  or rarely, at best (if
so, i'd love to hear it). 

unfortunately, we're all wanting what's familiar to us (myself included)
and branching out is a risky thing.  but honestly this aint too big a
leap, in my eyes!  these events connect us with deeper currents and older
art forms more directly, like happenings, classical performances (in the
old sense of the term), and ceremonial gatherings of every description. 
they're not so different from a rave, except the fact that people tend not
to dance (not that they can't, they just seem not to).  they're a place
where people can interact, and hear music or encounter environments
created especially for that event, by a special group of people who want
to do this for almost nothing (me, the performers, speaker- and equipment-
donators, anyone who helps).  yet this seems to be a challenge to many 
"ravers" out there who, as a supposedly "free-thinking" and "open-minded" 
pseudo-community, ought to know better.

these are sad facts, and ultimately i agree that the only way to get the 
message across--to open people's minds--is to do it by stealth, by 
dressing up something new in the guise of something familiar.  if i 
really wanted to succeed i'd get woody mcbride or someone of equal 
stature involved in an event.  but chances are, people like him can't (or 
won't) come down to earth for something like this, and while that may be 
fair in some respects, i just can't afford to do something even this 
weird and lose that kind of money on it.  it's got to start from below.

besides, i'd rather have it home-based, as there are plenty of worthy
musicians right here in my own town.  columbus, of all places, has a
wonderfully rich pool of musicians and artists, some of whom have been
doing electronic music for years and years.  i want to give new people a
chance to be heard, but i also want to bring the old-schoolers back into
the fray; to give them an excuse to work on new material, to encourage
them and to help them realize that their music can be part of this
phenomenon...which is tied closely with raves and all that, but is somehow
deeper. 

so what are these ele_ment events?  well, even if you've read this far,
it's possible that you have no idea.  so i'll explain it clearly: they
aren't really raves, they're concerts...but not like rock concerts,
they're a bit deeper than that.  they're concerts for electronic music
(mostly techno) and environments, presented by artists who really care
about their work and spent a lot of time getting material together. the
most expensive one was only $2 to get in.  OPTIONAL. 

even so, these events have been pretty sparsely-attended, the biggest was 
helium last november because it was free and happened to feature todd 
sines in a starring role.  that's our "big name," i guess...or maybe 
titonton?

*sigh* no, i dont mean to sound reproachful, there has been real support
for local artists, but please understand, this takes a lot of work, and i
know that if people actually came they WOULD get it, they WOULD like it...
maybe not quite how _i_ imagine it, but that's part of the point anyway...
it's meant to be completed by the people who actually attend.  in a larger
sense, i see these events as works of art, completed by whoever shows
up...so naturally i feel a sparsely-attended "work" is somewhat of an
artistic failure. 

i don't mean to sound pretentious...these events aren't some grandiose 
"new thing," in fact they're quite an old idea (as i've already made 
clear).  but on an even more basic level, these events are about 
interacting with music in whichever way you feel comfortable.  what could 
be more simple than that?

and even a "failure" like boron really wasn't, because those who did make
it felt something special as the room was was filled with some of the best
music and ideas i have ever encountered.  a lot of people that were there
appreciated what was happening around them.  i saw people interacting with
the music, and with each other, in new ways.  that was the shit.  but i 
only wish there had been more of them...there _should_ have been more of 
them. 

anyway, let me set the stage:

early-evening.  in a large, hot, carpeted, rectangular, communal living
room, lined with sliding-glass doors (a room that would have served 30
years ago to debut new works by philip glass or whomever), four artists
brought all of their gear to present their own ideas.  the room was
overflowing with cables, speakers, keyboards, and so on...an amazing
takeover of a space. 

mike poe, known as MIDI SLUT, has been twiddling around in columbus with
electronic music for quite a few years.  he began the event with some
beautifully-sweet ambience, a 30-minute composition in several parts,
flowing into darker textures for a while, then into more melodic realms. 
very clean, almost clinically-precise, but very powerful and
mind-expanding.  each part of the 1st piece was interrupted by short
breaks between the "movements," which consisted of spoken-word material
from space records and other sources...voices that would fade in and out 
of comprehensibility.  cool stuff. 

then a couple songs with beats followed...one that seemed to be purely 
composed on the 808, using extremely complex drum patterning, but 
whose final pulse was just simply in its driving beat.

his last piece was the strongest, combining the ambient elements with 
beats, this time with a very slow, electro-type of beat.  this combined 
with a perfectly beautiful and unobtrusive melody to create what can only 
be described as "sex music."  :)  mindblowing.

tony ramos' visual performance came next, delayed slightly due to a
missing film, but evenually things got going okay.  for the first part,
tony projected images of battlefield technology, armies, etc, from a green
monochrome video projector, onto a king-sized sheet tacked to the opposing
wall.  on a table just below the sheet were two video monitors upon which
tony could play things from another vcr or repeat what was on the main,
green screen.  i showed snippets of an abstract film i made a couple years
ago, as well. 

karen kreutzfeld of gaga performed the incidental music, providing an 
extremely disturbing and harsh landscape of sounds that went perfectly 
with the images of war on the screen.

sometimes things didnt work quite so well, tony's switches were all pretty 
much rigged on the spot, and the videos he had were all randonly selected 
from a public library, so the war scenes kept getting interrupted by 
these commentator people who looked way out-of-place...but enough of a 
feel still came through to make a real statement (to me at least).  

part one of tony's show ended with slow-motion film-footage of delapidated
buildings in detroit (shot by tony himself).  then came a more organic
part of the performance featuring tapes of tony's own video-feedback from
previous performances...amazing amazing amazing.  tony has mastered
feedback in all forms...rings, flashes, color, swirls, etc...it's got to
be seen to be believed (who needs expensive computers?).  along with the
feedback tapes tony showed snippets of computer-animations such as
impossibly-complex gears, and the simple vector-graphics games of vectrex 
(remember asteroids?).  

i should point out that throughout the entire show tony could move images 
from monitor to projector and vice-versa...making it really chaotic (in a 
good way) and difficult to figure out quite what you were looking at.

meanwhile, karen's musical backdrop almost overwhelmed tony's visuals, 
with harsh drones from an old analog korg synthesizer, screetching away 
beautifully while she played other, softer sounds on a digital keyboard.

part two ended in silence, and just as everyone thought it was over
(including me), tony began typing something on the screen: a conversation
between two disembodied people, asking each other if they are "here." 
tony ended it for real by creating a huge ;-) on the big screen, and that
was it. 
 
i'm not sure if people got the technology/humanity theme (especially the
end part which didnt work as good as he'd hoped) but there was definitely
enough there to allow for some interesting thoughts to come into your
head.  i think that was tony's point...i dont think he wanted the theme to
be too obvious, i think he wanted people to put things together for
themselves. 

finally, came rich ratvasky, who plays music as IHANNOA.  his set was the
shortest, but everyone wanted more from this techno GOD!!!  haha...but
seriously, rich has mastered some incredible way of organizing sounds that
derives a lot from artists like orbital, yet somehow takes their ideas into
new planes entirely.  rich bulids up dense, intense layers and complex
rhythms, and then creates a seamless mix whose final impression is not
complex at all...just moving.  even mike poe was bamboozled.  tribal 
elements, smooth, silky chords, phat analog sounds, crisp percussion, 
touches of jungle syncopation (!)...great stuff.  nobody danced, which 
was beyond my comprehension, but maybe that was ok.  maybe no one knew 
quite how to dance, because his sounds were so unexpected...

after this we had an unannounced party at the space, with titonton,
powerhouse, jericho mark, and atman spinning.  this was my sly way of
getting people to go to the show first, by not saying anything about an
afterparty.  unfortunately that didnt work either because there were so
few people there in the first place, that the party was mostly empty.  OH 
WELL!  but the highlight and main point of the evening was obviously the
performances.  i hope i've done them justice. 

so the questions remain:  how do i keep doing these events?  

well, my feelings on the matter are immovable.  i'm going to keep doing
the ele_ment concerts till i drop, if i have to.  i am extremely proud of
the first 5 events.  each has been held at a different place, spreading a
positive energy wherever they have been held.  each has been a powerful
experience for me and for many of those who have attended.  the music at
each event has been phenomenal and every artist has devoted time, energy,
effort, and love into their performances...lugging all their precious gear
out into the elements (pun intended) to play for FREE.  

that's what these events are really all about.  they're about seeing
electronic musicians (and visual performers like tony) as artists, despite
their lack of "superstar" posture or stage antics...despite the fact that 
no "real" instruments are involved and it requires no real "musical ability" 
(supposedly).  it's all written by computers, isn't it?  ;)

from computers and keyboards to guitars, pianos, and violins, they're all
just tools of some kind that mean nothing without a musical or artistic
mind behind them. these events are trying to call attention to that
process of organizing the almost limitless sounds available to electronic
musicians (or visual artists, or whatever) into a very personal form 
which they share with us. 

i'd like to thank these performers, then, officially, since this is in
effect the one year anniversary of these events, and i could not have done
_anything_ without the music and environments they've provided, so i
dedicate this post to them. 

for now, i'm not going to answer the real questions about how i can make
these ele_ment event work "better," nor how i can reach more of you, or
more of the "ravers," or more of whomEVER.  if you read this far, i'm not
worried about converting you.;) the hard part is to try to convince others
that what is going on with these events is worth my effort...and worth
noticing and/or supporting, even if from afar.  it's these kinds of events
(ele_ments or otherwise)--ones that challenge others to meet me halfway
(or even 10% of the way!)--that give me my sense of purpose.  i'll keep
doing them as long as i can, i just need to feel that someone's listening. 

so now it's up to you to write me and say "phat, keep doing it," or maybe
show up, propose something to expand the idea of a "rave" yourself (what a
CONCEPT!), or whatever.  that's why one of our special events earlier 
this summer was called ACTIVE NOT PASSIVE.  time to act again... 

thanks for reading.

*** ANNOUNCING: house4all@gmx1.com (The Efficient Music Mailing List) ***

Finally! An efficient house music Internet mailing list that delivers its
messages in minutes or hours, not days or weeks!

With the recent fall of "so-deep@netcom.com" I realized that people wanted
a place to converse about house music, club culture, DJs, Song IDs, Record
Stores, Parties, Mix Shows, etc, etc, etc ... but the resources that NetCom
had were drastically incapable of keeping up with the technical demands.

So, I have created:  house4all@gmx1.com

house4all is an international email system that sends and receives messages
for its subscribers continuously, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  No
cumbersome hourly or daily "digest" updates, and no week-long waits (like
with NetCom) for messages.

house4all is hosted on GMX1's high-end multi-processor Sun server
equipment.  The servers are connected to the Internet via a fiber optic DS3
(T3 / 45 megabit) pipe, which connects directly to an OC3 ring (155
megabit) ... Yes, this is no joke.  The administrators maintaining
house4all all have a minimum of 15 years Internet/Unix experience.  So
enjoy our new playground!  :)

Hello to everyone.  Just wondering how many ppl are on this list? Is it new??

A little about me.  I am a househead.  Pure and simple.  Always have and 
pretty darn sure always will be (unless someone comes up with something better 
than house...is that possible?).

I'm 26 and I currently live in Minneapolis.  I'm from Pittsburgh and moved 
here 5 months ago.  I'm best familiar w/the DC/B-more rave scene and happy to 
say I was there in the beginning (I guess about 5-6 years ago).

I work as a Sales Rep for an office furniture manufacturer-boring but really 
good $$ and flexible schedule.  I hope to land a job managing the office for 
Deep Dish back in DC.  I'm good friends w/their agent whom I would also be 
working for.  They just need to find a SPACE for this office so in the 
meantime, I'm stuck out in the mid-west.

I've been to great clubs all over the US and in London and Amsterdam so I look 
forward to meeting some new househead friends on this list .  I'm also trying 
to keep up to date w/industry happenings so I have a clue when and if this job 
with Deep Dish materializes.

I hope this will be different from the other lists I'm on.  DC-raves is good 
because ppl are positive and they talk about good issues in the scene, but 
mw-raves really gets on my nerves because there is soooo much bitching and 
complaining.  They post in detail how their night at a party was like they 
have no REAL friends, only virtual friends on the computer!  Sorry if I'm 
offending anyone.  Maybe it's ME that's wrong, but I hope this list will be as 
uplifting as a great house track!!!

Talk to you all soon!!!!
Byeeeeeeeee!!!!

like he says, odi has got the skillz to pay the drum and bass bills. 
it's the rest of the DK crew playing too, so if they're all as good as
odi, it'll be the bomb.  and hey, $12 is a hell of a lot better than
$35, like some other parties cost...

    How come there's no buzz on the list about "that thing"?  DieselBoy
is spinning, I know, and the promoters are brand-spankin-new, I'm pretty
sure.  A lot of good DJ's like Rob Paine, the guy from Dee-lite, Smoov,
Ruffian, and others (even our friend Count Zero). If no one has the
info, I'll post it.

To get promos, herse what you do.. make a 60 minute tape of your radio
show (center the radio show on the type of music that the record company
you're tagerting markets) and basically send them a tape, saying you would
like to get on their "promotional mailing list"... its good to know
someone in the record company who might be able to push your name on..

I'm a dj in Toledo Oh. and I have JUST started getting things from reps 
by sending out a weekly playlist without fail. Everytime I get something 
with an e-mail address on it I add them to the list.
	Since I'm in college I also report to CMJ.....but I hear the 
reporting to 'hits' is better.

Happy spinning,
Pete

	I like alot of shit. I started out in the acid house scene in '86

to throw down some gabber once in awhile as well as ambient and good old 
noise (like Negativland & old Clock DVA)

 You DO realize this _IS_ mw-raves, don't you?? or did you mean NE-raves 
when you might have accidentally typed mw-raves??? WE wouldn't want you 
to get off on the wrong foot would we?? ;)

 I've been to some pretty awesome clubs in Berlin & Bremen btw, and ahve 
a few friends from the NE/Baltimore/DC scene as well! =)

 Glad to ahve you aboard! =)

Ok who ever subbed the whole Txraves list to this joke better take it off
immediately. Otherwise I can guarantee I will flood the list with junk
mail and transcripts of republical convention. Do it now. I give you 12
hours.

 >>>>>> Just released on Twitch Recordings <<<<<<


Artist:     The Electroliners
Title:      Loose Caboose Dubs
Format:     12" Single


This 12" contains the (until now) unreleased remix of "Loose Caboose" 
entitled
"Ghetto Train".  This is the mix that DJ Dan and Jim Hopkins have been 
playing 
off of acetate for the past few months.  

Side B contains an unedited version of "Crazy Train" that was not included
on the original "Loose Caboose" 12".  This version dips into even more
craziness as the second half of the mix has been sliced and diced to make
it even more insane.

This is a limited edition release.  Grab a copy before they are sold out. 
You can purchase copies direct from twitch (visit our web site at the
following address:

http://www.dnai.com/~twitch

Or you can also purchase copies at most DJ record stores throughout the 
U.S.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

              >>>>>> Also coming soon on SM:)E COMMUNICATIONS <<<<<<


BASCO - "The Beat Is Over" (ELECTROLINERS REMIX)

Jim Hopkins and DJ Dan have remixed this jam that has been shakin' the
dancefloors for the past 8 months.  This release should be out by the 3rd
week in September and will not be available through TWITCH.  Please check
your local DJ record store for availability.

Just in case anyone hasnt figured it out:

Someone subscribed several rave/techno related lists to house4all. This so
far, as I can tell includes:

txraves@io.com
313@hyperreal.com
mw-raves@hyperreal.com

and probably more.

I sent email to admin@gmx1.com already so please dont spam them or the
listowner, who i've already contacted. We will get this sorted out ASAP.
And if the list owner gets this, please email me privately because I have a
few things to tell you about netiquette....

I'm on the ambient list and the IDM list and also Missouri raves and
I'm only getting one copy of each house4all post.  Its sorta like
when you're at a two-room party and the walls in the chill-out room
are too thin and the house dj in the main room is playing really
annoying stuff...

Hey...how did I get on this list? Actually, it flashed up on my AOL 
account tonight?!?!?:) I'm subbed to TXRAVES on both AOL and ANET, but 
this only came up under the TXRAVES title at AOL...interesting.

Anyways, since peeps are introducing themselves, here's my story:)

I'm 20 and highly involed in the stabilization and progression of 
the Dallas scene. I spin Trance & Goa mainly, but I started out with 
Progressive House. I do not spin at raves (though I prefer the word 
*parties*...less stigma attached) yet, because I am swamped with other 
things right now. I am the creator/editor of SWELL (A D-based rave 
newsletter) and editor of the *rave* sector of The Grind zine. I threw a 
free party (Interface) here last weekend and am planning the next in 
Houston or Austin. I aid in the promotion of *lesser known*, yet 
ultra-deserving, DJ's who spin numerous types of 
music...blah...blah...blah...

If this is a *house* oriented list, you peeps should check out 
Dallas...total House/Funky Breaks focused scene...sux for me, but that's 
life:)

Still wondering how I got on this list....Sending Ultra-Mint-Positive 
Vibes to All...Take Care of Yourself and of Others!!!

Joe, Don't even pretend like you didn't subscribe to the HouseHead 
mailing list. And stop acting like you are one of those "junglist"...cuz 
we all know you like deep house

Subject: Is there a problem here?
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     OK, the way I see it, there's two possibilities for why this list
seems to be so widespread, and I can't tell which it is because the
stupid mail program my ISP uses strips all the headers from incoming
messages.

     First is the possibility that the original announcement of the list
was crossposted to a whole bunch of lists and people are using the reply
function without editing out the other lists from their reply headers.
Second is that somebody set up the list without really knowing what they
were doing and somehow inadvertantly subscribed NE-Raves, TX-Raves,
MW-Raves, 313 and possibly some other lists to House4all. (It is also
possible that doing so was deliberate, but I'll make no accusation
without further proof.)

     No, I've sent this message out without using the reply function; I
typed the House4all address directly into the To: line. So if this winds
up on any list other than House4all the problem is on that list, not in
the headers, and I'd like to officially ask the admin there to solve
this problem quick before it floods anyone's mailbox (particularly
mine). In the meantime, could everyone please double-check their
outgoing headers? That might help to alleviate the problem somewhat.

Okay... sorry that the Subject is a little deceiving... It's kinda
important for me and two friends of mine.  Um... The 3 of us need a ride
to Bassrush, because the ride that we were gonna go with isn't available
anymore... She said that she was gonna leave on Friday afternoon, but
neither I nor Trevor(412) (one of the peeps, along with his girlfriend)
could get off work.  :(

So... I guess what I'm doing is *BEGGING* for a ride to Bassrush.  We
definitely would cover *ALL* tolls and *ALL* gas money for there and
back... and of course we can bring them thar mix tapes for you listening
enjoyment.  Um... We're in Pittsburgh... not far at all from downtown
Pittsburgh... We'd like to know anytime up until the time you'd be
leaving... 

Um... you can reach me through email anytime... (of course)... or call me
anytime after 10:15pm today (Friday) or Saturday morning... (412) 767-5409
or you can call Trevor anytime after 6:30, I believe, at (412) 361-4103...

We totally would appreciate this, not only for our sakes, but because
Bassrush is on Trevor's g/f's birthday, and she really wants to go!  I
think that's awesome!  But anyway... I guess that's all... Hopefully we'll
hear from someone out there soon.

Subject: Is there a problem here?
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     OK, the way I see it, there are two possibilities for why the
House4all list seems to be so widespread, but I can't tell which is the
case because the stupid mail program my ISP uses strips all the headers
from incoming messages.

     First is the possibility that the original announcement of the list
was crossposted to a whole bunch of lists and people are using the reply
function without editing out the other lists from their reply headers.
Second is that somebody set up the list without really knowing what they
were doing and somehow inadvertently subscribed NE-Raves, TX-Raves,
MW-Raves, 313, lowlands and possibly some other lists to House4all. (It
is also possible that doing so was deliberate, but I'll make no
accusation without further proof.)

     Now, I've sent this message out without using the reply function; I
typed the House4all address directly into the To: line. So if you got
this message without subscribing to House4all then the problem is on
that list, not in the headers, and I'd like to officially ask the admin
there to solve this problem quick before it floods any more mailboxes
(particularly mine). In the meantime, could everyone please double-check
their outgoing headers? That might help to alleviate the problem somewhat.

     My apologies to the lists for the double post. It appeared that the
first one had bounced, but apparently the bounce was only from certain
addresses which have been subscribed to House4all. Anyway, it now seems
safe to say that the problem originates at the House4all site, so those
of you who have filters should activate them, while the rest of us
start exercising our delete-key fingers. :/  And bunches of hostile mail
to the list address will just clog things up even more, so pretty please
don't send any. If anyone has the House4all administrator's address,
could you send a copy thru the list? Then we can all complain directly
to the man responsible.

Okay for those that dont know, every rave related list on the net
was subbed to:

house4all@gmx1.com

I contacted the site where gmx1.com is run out of this evening at 11:30pm
CST and talked to a system administrator. He is going to berate the gmx1.com
people who run house4all, since it seems that this was fully intentional on
their part. 

If all goes well, gmx1.com will get taken off the net for creating massive
spam...

Until this happens (he said the morning, which is pretty general) I would
ask all of you to *not* post any more messages to house4all@gmx1.com as it 
ends up on THOUSANDS of mailboxes around the world. Thanks.

"in the beginning there was jack, and jack had a groove, and from
this groove came the groove of all grooves. and while one day
viciously throwing down in his box, jack boldly declared, 'let
there be house', and house music was born. 'i am, you see, i am
the creator, and this is my house, and in my house there is only
house music. but i am not so selfish, because once you've been to
my house, it then becomes our house and our house music. and you
see, no one man owns house, because house music is a universal
makeup spoken and understood by all. you see, house is a feeling,
and no one can understand the feeling unless he's deep into our
house. house is an uncontrollable desire to jack your body, and 
as i told you before, this is our house and our house music, and
every cop should understand that for the people. and in this house
of the people is jack. now some of you might wonder, who is jack
and what it is that jack does. jack is the one who gives you the
power to test your body, jack is the one who gives you the power
to do a state, jack is the one who gives you the key to the way
we were, jack is the one who learns you how to work your body, jack
is the one that can bring nations and nations of all peoples together
under one house. you may be black, you may be white, you may be jew
or gentile, it don't make no difference in our house..."

Fuck you House4All
I hate you

Fine... since every list is getting this, EVERYONE will hear about my dream:

<dream>
OK, so I had this dream last night

I was going to the bathroom, standing there naked taking a piss... and in
walks this 90 year old man... he kneels down next to me while I'm peeing,
and I turn to him and start fucking him in his *goiter*.

Yes, goiter sex.

(For those of you who don't know what a goiter is, it's that metal hole they
put in your throat if you don't have a voicebox... or something along those
lines)


</dream>

Ahhhhhhhhh.... an excuse for a *one liner*, which on some lists aren't
welcome.  Figure out which ones.  Well I feel the same:  any 
mail that I am not expecting is junk mail!

If this goes on I will be obliged to crash the mailserver of whatever
moron started this crap. Btw, this could be considerd "denial of service
attack" and is against the law.

Neither did I ask to be put on this list.  My mail volume is way too high 
as it is -- I'll subscribe on my own if/when I decide to.  Please take me 
off the list pronto.  

BTW, this is really a questionable practice -- subscribing people who 
haven't asked -- don't you think?

That might be a little bit of an exaggeration, but honestly, we Americans
have no idea what personal freedom or real liberty mean.  We have a
horrible tendancy to cave in to the status quo, moral majority, or path of
least resistance.

A guy from Ghana who's lived in several countries and a couple military
regimes said there's less freedom here than anywhere he's lived.

Maybe when matters in a country are more severe, people have a better
grasp of what the consequences of deviant action _really_ might be.

geez, that didn't make any sense, but hey, I haven't slept much.

If you're in the area but can't make it to Mass Konfusion, here's
something.  

According to yesterday's Pitt news, I'm throwing a "rave" in my house
tonight.  Um, somebody forgot to tell me...but it's all good. :) This is
the
get-together where I asked if anybody felt like spinning....hell, if the
pitt news can advertise a party at my house, I think I can post an open
invitation to this list, fuck my anal indie roommate.  (But don't tell him
that...he's in charge of the keg....)

So, yes, not a rave, but a laid back (I think) get together with bands in
the
basement and records of all kinds on the 3rd floor.  Bring yourself,
records, mixtapes,
tinsel, crayons, coloring books, a checker board, a couple bucks if you
want to drink, and a good friend to help celebrate the end of a glorious
lease.

There will be no furniture, no police coming in my door cuz I know my
rights, hopefully no neighbors calling them in the first place, and no
stress on my part.  This means if you're bored I really don't give a shit
and I'd suggest you leave or start up a conversation cuz the people will
be cool.  :)

203 morewood Ave, off baum blvd, in North oakland near
Shadyside/bloomfield.  There are some faces I expect, or at least hope to
see.....you know who you are.  ;) 

(all teary eyed...) This is my last night in Pgh before I move to
Philly-town---but only after Bassrush!!! 

Properly ending the summer of love with love of summer,
steph

Ok.  I think I managed to get the pb-cle list unsubbed from that 
listserv.  We'll know if it worked in a day or so (assuming, of course, 
that the node it's sourcing from hasn't been mailbombed into /dev/null).

Hey all

  I'v just been hanging around checking out websites on U-Pitt's lovely
new P5-166mhz machines, and I for the first time found the website for
Metalheadz, and it's excellent!  The design is awesome, and there's lots
of cool info for dnB heads.  they seem to still be working on parts, but
it's worth checking out, expecially if you can handle lots of graphics and
frames.

   http://www.obsolete.com/thereal/metalheadz/index.html

On a sad note, I'm sorry to say we'v lost a truely cool pgh kid and scene
supporter to that other city in pennsylvania, and definately, I'll miss
you Steph. :)

any reviews of mass konfusion?  that's all for now. :P

    There's a little disturbing news I heard about the rave last night. 
A friend of mine was videotaping ravers for an art project, just taping
the dancing and the people (not the drugs) and was accosted by a group
of "ravers".  They demanded to review the tape, and once reviewed, they
destroyed it even though it had no scenes of drug use.  After that, they
proceeded to beat the living shit out of my friend, who is now missing
three teeth.

    Now, tell me, is that what raving in Pittsburgh is about?  There was
no peace, love, unity or respect in those actions.  It disturbs me.  If
anyone can shed some light on the subject, please do.

                                                                -Ken

Has anyone seen the levis jean commercial?

Well I thought that that was an excellent ex. of Breaks.

That song kicked "Raw @$$" so much that i have to ask who the creator is.

Also if anyone can tell me the name of that one jungle song that had the same 

tune as "Were Jammon", by Ziggy Marley I would be vary grateful.
